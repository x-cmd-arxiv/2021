treatment effects in a multi-valued treatment framework where the number of
units in the treatment arms can be small and do not grow with the sample size.
We accomplish this by casting the model as a semi-/non-parametric conditional
quantile model and using known finite sample results about the law of the
indicator function that defines the conditional quantile. Our framework allows
for structural functions that are non-additively separable, with flexible
functional forms and heteroskedasticy in the residuals, and it also encompasses
commonly used designs like difference in difference. We study the finite sample
behavior of our test in a Monte Carlo study and we also apply our results to
assessing the effect of weather events on GDP growth.

noise, in which no additional information about clean images or noise level
parameters is available. Particularly, when only ""single"" noisy images are
available for training a denoiser, the denoising performance of existing
methods was not satisfactory. Recently, the blind pixelwise affine image
denoiser (BP-AIDE) was proposed and significantly improved the performance in
the above setting, to the extent that it is competitive with denoisers which
utilized additional information. However, BP-AIDE seriously suffered from slow
inference time due to the inefficiency of noise level estimation procedure and
that of the blind-spot network (BSN) architecture it used. To that end, we
propose Fast Blind Image Denoiser (FBI-Denoiser) for Poisson-Gaussian noise,
which consists of two neural network models; 1) PGE-Net that estimates
Poisson-Gaussian noise parameters 2000 times faster than the conventional
methods and 2) FBI-Net that realizes a much more efficient BSN for pixelwise
affine denoiser in terms of the number of parameters and inference speed.
Consequently, we show that our FBI-Denoiser blindly trained solely based on
single noisy images can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several
real-world noisy image benchmark datasets with much faster inference time (x
10), compared to BP-AIDE. The official code of our method is available at

Therefore, it is hard to know the avoiding due to the non-hermiticity. For the
second-order, the lattice propagator has two poles as before. This case also
does not suffer from the doubling problem. Hence separating the forward

the Floquet engineering, various new realms on experimentally simulating

only applies to time periodic non-dissipative Hermitian systems, and for the
quantum systems in reality, non-Hermitian process with dissipation usually
occurs. So far, it remains unclear how to characterize topological phases of

Hamiltonian. Here, we propose the non-Floquet theory to identify different
Floquet topological phases of time periodic non-Hermitian systems via the
generation of Floquet band gaps in frequency space. In non-Floquet theory, the
eigenstates of non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian are temporally deformed to be
of Wannier-Stark localization. Remarkably, we show that different choices of
starting points of driving period can result to different localization
behavior, which effect can reversely be utilized to design detectors of quantum
phases in dissipative oscillating fields. Our protocols establish a fundamental
rule for describing topological features in non-Hermitian dynamical systems and
can find its applications to construct new types of Floquet topological

2.2--2.3 GHz with the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) 70 m dish (DSS-63) in
Madrid, Spain from FRB~20200120E. This repeating fast radio burst (FRB) was
recently discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast
Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) instrument and reported to be associated with the M81
spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. The high time resolution capabilities
of the recording system used in this observation, together with the small
amount of scattering and intrinsic brightness of the burst, allow us to explore
the burst structure in unprecedented detail. We find that the burst has a
duration of roughly 30 $\mu$s and is comprised of several narrow components
with typical separations of 2--3 $\mu$s. The narrowest component has a width of
$\lesssim$ 100 ns, which corresponds to a light travel time size as small as 30
m, the smallest associated with an FRB to date. The peak flux density of the
narrowest burst component is 270 Jy. We estimate the total spectral luminosity
of the narrowest component of the burst to be 4 $\times$ 10$^{\text{30}}$ erg
s$^{\text{-1}}$ Hz$^{\text{-1}}$, which is a factor of $\sim$500 above the
luminosities of the so-called ""nanoshots"" associated with giant pulses from the
Crab pulsar. This spectral luminosity is also higher than that of the radio
bursts detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 during its outburst in
April 2020, but it falls on the low-end of the currently measured luminosity
distribution of extragalatic FRBs. These results provide further support for
the presence of a continuum of FRB burst luminosities.

attention in recent years. However, recent models depend on supervised training
with 3D pose ground truth data or known pose priors for their target domains.
3D pose data is typically collected with motion capture devices, severely

3D human pose datasets and uses easy-to-access observations from the target

models in two practical settings where 3D pose data can hardly be obtained:
human poses in bed, and infant poses in the wild. Furthermore, we show that
HW-HuP retains comparable performance to cutting-edge models on public

application scenarios to record, stimulate, or inhibit neural activity with
different purposes. An example is the stimulation of some brain areas to reduce
the effects generated by Parkinson's disease. Despite the advances in recent
years, cybersecurity on BCI is an open challenge since attackers can exploit
the vulnerabilities of invasive BCIs to induce malicious stimulation or
treatment disruption, affecting neuronal activity. In this work, we design and
implement a novel neuronal cyberattack, called Neuronal Jamming (JAM), which
prevents neurons from producing spikes. To implement and measure the JAM
impact, and due to the lack of realistic neuronal topologies in mammalians, we
have defined a use case with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to
allow a mouse to exit a particular maze. The resulting model has been
translated to a neural topology, simulating a portion of a mouse's visual
cortex. The impact of JAM on both biological and artificial networks is
measured, analyzing how the attacks can both disrupt the spontaneous neural
signaling and the mouse's capacity to exit the maze. Besides, we compare the
impacts of both JAM and FLO (an existing neural cyberattack) demonstrating that
JAM generates a higher impact in terms of neuronal spike rate. Finally, we
discuss on whether and how JAM and FLO attacks could induce the effects of
neurodegenerative diseases if the implanted BCI had a comprehensive electrode
coverage of the targeted brain regions.

definition of particle current. Introducing no arbitrary functions, we consider
the evolution of current (which does not coincide with the momentum density).
It leads to a set of new function which, to the best of our knowledge, have not

reverse relativistic (gamma) factor. Its current is also considered as one of
basic functions. Evolution of new functions appears via the concentration and
particle current so the set of equations partially closes itself. Other

of these four vectors leads to appearance of two four tensors which are

their underlying mechanisms are not always clear. In statistics, power law
distribution is often found to fit data exceptionally well when the normal
(Gaussian) distribution fails. Nevertheless, predicting power law phenomena is
notoriously difficult because some of its idiosyncratic properties such as lack
of well-defined average value, and potentially unbounded variance. TPL
(Taylor's power law), a power law first discovered to characterize the spatial
and/or temporal distribution of biological populations and recently extended to
describe the spatiotemporal heterogeneities (distributions) of human
microbiomes and other natural and artificial systems such as fitness
distribution in computational (artificial) intelligence. The power law with
exponential cutoff (PLEC) is a variant of power-law function that tapers off
the exponential growth of power-law function ultimately and can be particularly
useful for certain predictive problems such as biodiversity estimation and
turning-point prediction for COVID-19 infection/fatality. Here, we propose
coupling (integration) of TPL and PLEC to offer improved prediction quality of

prediction using TPL and the asymptote estimation using PLEC and delivers
confidence interval for the asymptote. We demonstrate the integrated approach

representation of the uncertainties, we formulate a multistage stochastic
integer program to dynamically locate facilities in each period and compare it
with a two-stage approach that determines the facility locations up front. In
the multistage model, in each stage, a decision maker optimizes facility
locations and recourse flows from open facilities to demand sites, to minimize
certain risk measures of the cost associated with current facility location and
shipment decisions. When the budget is also uncertain, a popular modeling
framework is to prioritize the candidate sites. In the two-stage model, the
priority list is decided in advance and fixed through all periods, while in the
multistage model, the priority list can change adaptively. In each period, the
decision maker follows the priority list to open facilities according to the
realized budget, and optimizes recourse flows given the realized demand. Using
expected conditional risk measures (ECRMs), we derive tight lower bounds for
the gaps between the optimal objective values of risk-averse multistage models

prioritization. Moreover, we propose two approximation algorithms to
efficiently solve risk-averse two-stage and multistage models without

invariant under conjugation. There is a well-known analog of Fourier analysis,

execution performance and hardware efficiency. Uniform post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods are common, since they can be implemented
efficiently in hardware and do not require extensive hardware resources or a
training set. Mapping FP32 models to INT8 using uniform PTQ yields models with
negligible accuracy degradation; however, reducing precision below 8 bits with
PTQ is challenging, as accuracy degradation becomes noticeable, due to the
increase in quantization noise. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-aware
quantization (SPARQ) method, in which the unstructured and dynamic activation
sparsity is leveraged in different representation granularities. 4-bit
quantization, for example, is employed by dynamically examining the bits of
8-bit values and choosing a window of 4 bits, while first skipping zero-value
bits. Moreover, instead of quantizing activation-by-activation to 4 bits, we
focus on pairs of 8-bit activations and examine whether one of the two is equal
to zero. If one is equal to zero, the second can opportunistically use the
other's 4-bit budget; if both do not equal zero, then each is dynamically
quantized to 4 bits, as described. SPARQ achieves minor accuracy degradation
and a practical hardware implementation. The code is available at

capable of extracting rich features from large-scale input data, but they do
not support general graph inputs. To bridge the gap between GCNs and CNNs, in
this paper we study the problem of how to effectively and efficiently map
general graphs to 2D grids that CNNs can be directly applied to, while
preserving graph topology as much as possible. We therefore propose two novel
graph-to-grid mapping schemes, namely, {\em graph-preserving grid layout

efficiency. We formulate the GPGL problem as integer programming and further
propose an approximate yet efficient solver based on a penalized Kamada-Kawai

novel vertex separation penalty that encourages graph vertices to lay on the

is characterised by low gas density and extinction, but with large temperature
variations, coincident with fast shock regions. Moreover, we find large
temperature discrepancies in knot C, when using different temperature-sensitive
lines. The relative impact of the knots in the metal enrichment differs. While
knot B is strongly enriching its closest surrounding, knot C is likely the main
distributor of metals in the halo. In knot A, part of the metal enriched gas
seems to escape through low density channels towards the south. We compare the
metallicities from two methods and find large discrepancies in knot C, a

table structure recognition. Most prior work on this problem focuses on either
task without offering an end-to-end solution or paying attention to real

Examples of such properties are the rate of decay at infinity of ""matrix

known results, new results, and conjectures in the theory of ""size"" of

to classify the above mentioned families of representations and accordingly to
estimate the relevant analytic properties of each family. Specifically, we
treat two main issues: the first is the introduction of a rigorous definition

issue is a method to construct and obtain information on each family of

notions of size that we call U-RANK, TENSOR RANK and ASYMPTOTIC RANK, and we
develop a method called ETA CORRESPONDENCE to construct the families of

large-scale privacy-preserving machine learning. However, high communication
overheads due to frequent gradient transmissions decelerate FL. To mitigate the
communication overheads, two main techniques have been studied: (i) local
update of weights characterizing the trade-off between communication and
computation and (ii) gradient compression characterizing the trade-off between
communication and precision. To the best of our knowledge, studying and
balancing those two trade-offs jointly and dynamically while considering their
impacts on convergence has remained unresolved even though it promises
significantly faster FL. In this paper, we first formulate our problem to
minimize learning error with respect to two variables: local update
coefficients and sparsity budgets of gradient compression who characterize
trade-offs between communication and computation/precision, respectively. We
then derive an upper bound of the learning error in a given wall-clock time
considering the interdependency between the two variables. Based on this
theoretical analysis, we propose an enhanced FL scheme, namely Fast FL (FFL),
that jointly and dynamically adjusts the two variables to minimize the learning
error. We demonstrate that FFL consistently achieves higher accuracies faster
than similar schemes existing in the literature.

difficult to interpret. In this work, we use the SPARC/MITgcm global
circulation model to simulate the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b
under different conditions, such as atmospheric drag and the absence of TiO and
VO. We then employ a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, HIRES-MCRT, to
self-consistently model high-resolution transmission spectra with iron (Fe I)
lines at different phases during the transit. To untangle the structure of the
resulting cross-correlation map, we decompose the limb of the planet into four
sectors, and we analyse each of their contributions separately. Our experiments
demonstrate that the cross-correlation signal of an ultra-hot Jupiter is
primarily driven by its temperature structure, rotation and dynamics, while
being less sensitive to the precise distribution of iron across the atmosphere.
We also show that the previously published iron signal of WASP-76b can be
reproduced by a model featuring iron condensation on the leading limb.
Alternatively, the signal may be explained by a substantial temperature
asymmetry between the trailing and leading limb, where iron condensation is not
strictly required to match the data. Finally, we compute the $K_{p}-V_{sys}$
maps of the simulated WASP-76b atmospheres, and we show that rotation and
dynamics can lead to multiple peaks that are displaced from zero in the
planetary rest frame.

the near- and mid-infrared bands. Here we analyze the previously neglected
effect of infrared spectral index of monitored objects on the Doppler-boosted
continuum emission in a narrow band. In contrast to main-sequences stars, the
detected compact infrared-excess dust-enshrouded objects have an enhanced
Doppler-boosting effect by as much as an order of magnitude, with the
variability amplitude of the order of ten percent for the most eccentric

are also expected to exhibit a stronger Doppler-boosted signal by a factor of
at least four in comparison with canonical S stars. In case the stellar orbit
is robustly determined, the relative flux variation can thus provide hints
about the nature of the objects. For extended dust-enshrouded objects, such as
G1, that are variable due to tidal, ellipsoidal, bow-shock, and irradiation
effects, the subtraction of the expected Doppler-boosting variations will help
to better comprehend their internal physics. In addition, the relative flux
variability due to higher-order relativistic effects is also modified for

on the transformer backbone and offers interpretability of the model's
decisions at both the epoch and sequence level. We further propose a simple yet
efficient method to quantify uncertainty in the model's decisions. The method,
which is based on entropy, can serve as a metric for deferring low-confidence
epochs to a human expert for further inspection. Results: Making sense of the
transformer's self-attention scores for interpretability, at the epoch level,
the attention scores are encoded as a heat map to highlight sleep-relevant
features captured from the input EEG signal. At the sequence level, the
attention scores are visualized as the influence of different neighboring
epochs in an input sequence (i.e. the context) to recognition of a target
epoch, mimicking the way manual scoring is done by human experts. Conclusion:
Additionally, we demonstrate that SleepTransformer performs on par with
existing methods on two databases of different sizes. Significance: Equipped

SleepTransformer holds promise for being integrated into clinical settings.

solutions. Inspired by rapidly growing impact of deep learning on scientific

challenges for finding the Green's functions of the equations on arbitrary

solving the target equations under different boundary conditions and sources.
We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by experiments

  Parsing",,,"10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2021.56",,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Grammar compression is, next to Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) and run-length
Burrows-Wheeler transform (RLBWT), one of the most flexible approaches to
representing and processing highly compressible strings. The main idea is to
represent a text as a context-free grammar whose language is precisely the
input string. This is called a straight-line grammar (SLG). An AVL grammar,
proposed by Rytter [Theor. Comput. Sci., 2003] is a type of SLG that
additionally satisfies the AVL-property: the heights of parse-trees for
children of every nonterminal differ by at most one. In contrast to other SLG
constructions, AVL grammars can be constructed from the LZ77 parsing in
compressed time: $\mathcal{O}(z \log n)$ where $z$ is the size of the LZ77
parsing and $n$ is the length of the input text. Despite these advantages, AVL
grammars are thought to be too large to be practical.
  We present a new technique for rapidly constructing a small AVL grammar from
an LZ77 or LZ77-like parse. Our algorithm produces grammars that are always at
least five times smaller than those produced by the original algorithm, and
never more than double the size of grammars produced by the practical Re-Pair
compressor [Larsson and Moffat, Proc. IEEE, 2000]. Our algorithm also achieves
low peak RAM usage. By combining this algorithm with recent advances in
approximating the LZ77 parsing, we show that our method has the potential to
construct a run-length BWT from an LZ77 parse in about one third of the time
and peak RAM required by other approaches. Overall, we show that AVL grammars
are surprisingly practical, opening the door to much faster construction of key
compressed data structures.

architectures, various applications of such models have been proposed over
time. In the field of anomaly detection, improvements in deep learning opened
new prospects of exploration for the researchers whom tried to automate the
labor-intensive features of data collection. First, in terms of data
collection, it is impossible to anticipate all the anomalies that might exist
in a given environment. Second, assuming we limit the possibilities of
anomalies, it will still be hard to record all these scenarios for the sake of
training a model. Third, even if we manage to record a significant amount of
abnormal data, it's laborious to annotate this data on pixel or even frame
level. Various approaches address the problem by proposing one-class
classification using generative models trained on only normal data. In such
methods, only the normal data is used, which is abundantly available and
doesn't require significant human input. However, these are trained with only
normal data and at the test time, given abnormal data as input, may often
generate normal-looking output. This happens due to the hallucination
characteristic of generative models. Next, these systems are designed to not
use abnormal examples during the training. In this paper, we propose anomaly
detection with negative learning (ADNL), which employs the negative learning
concept for the enhancement of anomaly detection by utilizing a very small
number of labeled anomaly data as compared with the normal data during
training. The idea is to limit the reconstruction capability of a generative
model using the given a small amount of anomaly examples. This way, the network
not only learns to reconstruct normal data but also encloses the normal
distribution far from the possible distribution of anomalies.

sandboxes, respectively. The lack of integration between the two implies that
the samples captured by the honeypots must be manually submitted for analysis

by the potential use of anti-analysis techniques and the inability to identify
features for effective detection and identification of IoT botnets. In this

electrodynamics of the MS and try resolve the issues associated with this most
important state of all superconductors. It is shown that the concept of Cooper
pairing along with the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition allows one to
construct a semi-classical theoretical model consistently addressing properties
of the MS and beyond, including non-equilibrium properties of superconductors
caused by the total current. As follows from the model, the three ""big zeros""
of superconductivity (zero resistance, induction and entropy) have equal weight
and grow from a single root: quantization of the angular momentum of paired
electrons. The model predicts some yet unknown effects. If confirmed, they can
help in studies of microscopic properties of all superconductors. Preliminary
experimental results suggesting the need to revise the standard picture of the
MS are presented.

  Generalized Framework with Linear Convergence",,,,,"cs.LG cs.IT math.IT math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Policy optimization, which finds the desired policy by maximizing value
functions via optimization techniques, lies at the heart of reinforcement
learning (RL). In addition to value maximization, other practical
considerations arise as well, including the need of encouraging exploration,
and that of ensuring certain structural properties of the learned policy due to
safety, resource and operational constraints. These can often be accounted for
via regularized RL, which augments the target value function with a
structure-promoting regularizer.
  Focusing on discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, we propose
a generalized policy mirror descent (GPMD) algorithm for solving regularized
RL. As a generalization of policy mirror descent (arXiv:2102.00135), our
algorithm accommodates a general class of convex regularizers and promotes the
use of Bregman divergence in cognizant of the regularizer in use. We
demonstrate that our algorithm converges linearly to the global solution over
an entire range of learning rates, in a dimension-free fashion, even when the
regularizer lacks strong convexity and smoothness. In addition, this linear
convergence feature is provably stable in the face of inexact policy evaluation
and imperfect policy updates. Numerical experiments are provided to corroborate
the appealing performance of GPMD.

machine learning. Among others, a foundational notation is group fairness. The
vast majority of the existing works on group fairness, with a few exceptions,
primarily focus on debiasing with respect to a single sensitive attribute,
despite the fact that the co-existence of multiple sensitive attributes (e.g.,
gender, race, marital status, etc.) in the real-world is commonplace. As such,
methods that can ensure a fair learning outcome with respect to all sensitive
attributes of concern simultaneously need to be developed. In this paper, we
study the problem of information-theoretic intersectional fairness (InfoFair),
where statistical parity, a representative group fairness measure, is
guaranteed among demographic groups formed by multiple sensitive attributes of
interest. We formulate it as a mutual information minimization problem and
propose a generic end-to-end algorithmic framework to solve it. The key idea is
to leverage a variational representation of mutual information, which considers
the variational distribution between learning outcomes and sensitive
attributes, as well as the density ratio between the variational and the
original distributions. Our proposed framework is generalizable to many
different settings, including other statistical notions of fairness, and could
handle any type of learning task equipped with a gradient-based optimizer.
Empirical evaluations in the fair classification task on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively debias the
classification results with minimal impact to the classification accuracy.

Andreev reflection, when the incident energy of electron is small, the

of Andreev reflection increases as the parameter $\alpha$ increases.
Interestingly, when the incident energy approaches the superconducting

transmission happens in the case of $\alpha = 1$. In the regime of Andreev
retro-reflection, when the parameter $\alpha$ increases, the probability of

a positive correlation between the mass of dense molecular gas in the

for triggering the accretion of mass to AGNs. Although the starburst-driven
turbulence is a key mechanism for the transfer of angular momentum and the
resultant mass accretion from the CND scale to the inner radius, the
observational evidence is lacking. We report the
very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) detection of the diffuse synchrotron
emission on a scale of several tens-pc coinciding spatially with the molecular
gas disk recently discovered by ALMA observations in NGC~1275. The synchrotron
emissions are most likely resulted from the relativistic electrons produced by
the supernova explosions. This is an unambiguous evidence of the star formation
activity in a CND. The turbulent velocity and the scale height of the CND
predicted from the supernova-driven turbulence model agree with the
observations, although the model-predicted accretion rate disagrees with the
bolometric luminosity. This might indicate that additional mechanisms to
enhance the turbulence is required for the inner disk. We discuss the

However, the converse statement of this conclusion fails with infinitely many

Specifically, if the historical data has the most information in some small

  To support this claim, we offer a case study with 240 projects, where we find
that the information in those projects ""clump"" towards the earliest parts of
the project. A quality prediction model learned from just the first 150 commits
works as well, or better than state-of-the-art alternatives. Using just this
""early bird"" data, we can build models very quickly and very early in the
project life cycle. Moreover, using this early bird method, we have shown that
a simple model (with just a few features) generalizes to hundreds of projects.

carbon emission reduction and energy conservation. The training of NILM models
requires massive load data containing different types of appliances. However,
inadequate load data and the risk of power consumer privacy breaches may be
encountered by local data owners during the NILM model training. To prevent
such potential risks, a novel NILM method named Fed-NILM which is based on
Federated Learning (FL) is proposed in this paper. In Fed-NILM, local model
parameters instead of local load data are shared among multiple data owners.
The global model is obtained by weighted averaging the parameters. Experiments
based on two measured load datasets are conducted to explore the generalization
ability of Fed-NILM. Besides, a comparison of Fed-NILM with locally-trained
NILMs and the centrally-trained NILM is conducted. The experimental results
show that Fed-NILM has superior performance in scalability and convergence.
Fed-NILM outperforms locally-trained NILMs operated by local data owners and
approximates the centrally-trained NILM which is trained on the entire load
dataset without privacy protection. The proposed Fed-NILM significantly
improves the co-modeling capabilities of local data owners while protecting
power consumers' privacy.

challenging features of watermarking methods that the trade-off between them

embedding strength based on the image content. Dynamic embedding helps the
network to have the lowest effect on the visual quality of the watermarked

improve the robustness of the model. Our method is a blind watermarking
approach that replicates the watermark string to create a matrix of the same
size as the input image. Instead of diffusing the watermark data into the input
image, we inject the data into the feature space and force the network to do
this in regions that increase the robustness against various attacks.
Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of

Therefore, the NMT model naturally involves the mechanism of the Language Model

its success, NMT still suffers from the hallucination problem, generating
fluent but inadequate translations. The main reason is that NMT pays excessive
attention to the partial translation while neglecting the source sentence to
some extent, namely overconfidence of the LM. Accordingly, we define the Margin
between the NMT and the LM, calculated by subtracting the predicted probability
of the LM from that of the NMT model for each token. The Margin is negatively
correlated to the overconfidence degree of the LM. Based on the property, we
propose a Margin-based Token-level Objective (MTO) and a Margin-based

mobile advertisement network, fraudulent ad clicks result in huge financial
losses for advertisers. Extensive studies identify click fraud according to
click/traffic patterns based on dynamic analysis. However, in this study, we
identify a novel click fraud, named humanoid attack, which can circumvent
existing detection schemes by generating fraudulent clicks with similar
patterns to normal clicks. We implement the first tool ClickScanner to detect
humanoid attacks on Android apps based on static analysis and variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) with limited knowledge of fraudulent examples. We define
novel features to characterize the patterns of humanoid attacks in the apps'
bytecode level. ClickScanner builds a data dependency graph (DDG) based on
static analysis to extract these key features and form a feature vector. We
then propose a classification model only trained on benign datasets to overcome
the limited knowledge of humanoid attacks.
  We leverage ClickScanner to conduct the first large-scale measurement on app
markets (i.e.,120,000 apps from Google Play and Huawei AppGallery) and reveal
several unprecedented phenomena. First, even for the top-rated 20,000 apps,
ClickScanner still identifies 157 apps as fraudulent, which shows the
prevalence of humanoid attacks. Second, it is observed that the ad SDK-based
attack (i.e., the fraudulent codes are in the third-party ad SDKs) is now a
dominant attack approach. Third, the manner of attack is notably different
across apps of various categories and popularities. Finally, we notice there
are several existing variants of the humanoid attack. Additionally, our
measurements demonstrate the proposed ClickScanner is accurate and
time-efficient (i.e., the detection overhead is only 15.35% of those of
existing schemes).

the classical stepped frequency radar waveform. The randomization in the

which the mapping between incoming data and waveforms is performed based on an
efficient combinatorial transform called the Lehmer code. Considering the
optimum maximum likelihood (ML) detection, the union bound and the nearest
neighbour approximation on the communication block error probability is derived
for communication in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The
results are further extended to incorporate the Rician fading channel model, of
which the Rayleigh fading channel model is presented as a special case.
Furthermore, an efficient communication receiver implementation is discussed
based on the Hungarian algorithm which achieves optimum performance with much
less operational complexity when compared to an exhaustive search. From the
radar perspective, two key analytical tools, namely, the ambiguity function

approximations to the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on the delay and Doppler

video understanding. However, most existing TAL benchmarks are built upon the
coarse granularity of action classes, which exhibits two major limitations in
this task. First, coarse-level actions can make the localization models overfit
in high-level context information, and ignore the atomic action details in the
video. Second, the coarse action classes often lead to the ambiguous
annotations of temporal boundaries, which are inappropriate for temporal action
localization. To tackle these problems, we develop a novel large-scale and
fine-grained video dataset, coined as FineAction, for temporal action
localization. In total, FineAction contains 103K temporal instances of 106
action categories, annotated in 17K untrimmed videos. Compared to the existing
TAL datasets, our FineAction takes distinct characteristics of fine action
classes with rich diversity, dense annotations of multiple instances, and
co-occurring actions of different classes, which introduces new opportunities
and challenges for temporal action localization. To benchmark FineAction, we
systematically investigate the performance of several popular temporal
localization methods on it, and deeply analyze the influence of fine-grained
instances in temporal action localization. As a minor contribution, we present
a simple baseline approach for handling the fine-grained action detection,
which achieves an mAP of 13.17% on our FineAction. We believe that FineAction
can advance research of temporal action localization and beyond.

matter candidates. Until now, many underground experiments searches for
super-WIMPs have been performed in the mass range of a few $\rm keV/c^2$ to 1
$\rm MeV/c^2$. All these searches utilize the absorption process of a
super-WIMP by a target atom in the detector, which is similar to the
photoelectric effect. In this study, we consider another process, namely, a
Compton-like process. As an example, we compare the cross-section of a
germanium atom for the absorption process with that of a Compton-like process.
Our findings indicate that the cross-section for the Compton-like process
becomes dominant, compared to that for the absorption process for mass above
approximately 150 $\rm keV/c^2$ for both pseudoscalar and vector super-WIMPs.
In particular, the cross-section for the Compton-like process for a vector
super-WIMP becomes increasingly greater than that for the absorption process by
an order of magnitude to two orders of magnitude in the 400 $\rm keV/c^2$ to 1
$\rm MeV/c^2$ mass range, respectively. By including the Compton-like process,
which has not been used in any other super-WIMP search experiment, the
experimental upper limits can be improved.

\emph{dualizable} if one can find an equivalent dual matrix norm on the dual
space $T^*$ such that under this dual matrix norm and the canonical dual matrix
cone, $T^*$ becomes a dual operator system.
  We show that ""a complete"" operator system $T$ is dualizable if and only if
$M_\infty(T)^\mathrm{sa}$ satisfies a bounded decomposition property. In this
case, $$\|f\|^\mathrm{d}:= \sup \big\{\big\|[f_{i,j}(x_{k,l})]\big\|: x\in

$T^\mathrm{d}$ is again dualizable.

dualizable operator systems, there is a unique weak-$^*$-continuous completely
positive completely bounded map $\phi^\mathrm{d}:T^\mathrm{d} \to S^\mathrm{d}$
which is compatible with the dual map $\phi^*$. This gives a full and faithful
functor from the category of dualizable operator systems to that of dualizable
dual operator systems.
  Moreover, we will verify that that if $S$ is either a $C^*$-algebra or a
unital operator system, then $S$ is dualizable and the canonical
weak-$^*$-homeomorphism from the unital operator system $S^{**}$ to the
operator system $(S^\mathrm{d})^\mathrm{d}$ is a completely isometric complete

wild is crucial for real-world applications, yet it remains challenging. The
difficulties lie in many aspects and this work focus on computing resource
constraint and long-tailed class distribution. Recently, classification-based
representation learning with deep neural networks and well-designed losses have
demonstrated good recognition performance. However, the computing and memory
cost linearly scales up to the number of identities (classes) in the training
set, and the learning process suffers from unbalanced classes. In this work, we
propose a dynamic class queue (DCQ) to tackle these two problems. Specifically,
for each iteration during training, a subset of classes for recognition are
dynamically selected and their class weights are dynamically generated
on-the-fly which are stored in a queue. Since only a subset of classes is
selected for each iteration, the computing requirement is reduced. By using a
single server without model parallel, we empirically verify in large-scale
datasets that 10% of classes are sufficient to achieve similar performance as
using all classes. Moreover, the class weights are dynamically generated in a
few-shot manner and therefore suitable for tail classes with only a few
instances. We show clear improvement over a strong baseline in the largest
public dataset Megaface Challenge2 (MF2) which has 672K identities and over 88%

non-abusive parts. This is due in part to the lack of datasets that explicitly
annotate heterogeneity in abusive language. We tackle this challenge by
providing an annotated dataset of abusive language in over 11,000 comments from
YouTube. We account for heterogeneity in this dataset by separately annotating
both the comment as a whole and the individual sentences that comprise each
comment. We then propose an algorithm that uses a supervised attention
mechanism to detect and categorize abusive content using multi-task learning.
We empirically demonstrate the challenges of using traditional techniques on
heterogeneous content and the comparative gains in performance of the proposed
approach over state-of-the-art methods.

Domain generalization aims at tackling this problem by learning transferable

generalization. The main assumption is that the Fourier phase information
contains high-level semantics and is not easily affected by domain shifts. To
force the model to capture phase information, we develop a novel Fourier-based
data augmentation strategy called amplitude mix which linearly interpolates
between the amplitude spectrums of two images. A dual-formed consistency loss

probe. In the case of undoped graphene, it has been generally understood that
the ultrafast terahertz thermal relaxation is mostly driven by the
electron-phonon coupling (EOP), which can be prolonged to tens and hundreds of
picoseconds. However, for the high doped graphene, which manifests the negative
photoinduced terahertz conductivity, there is still no consensus on the
dominant aspects of the cooling process on a time scale of a few picoseconds.
Here, the competition between the disorders assisted defect scattering and the
electron-phonon coupling process in the cooling process of the graphene
terahertz dynamics is systematically studied and disentangled. We verify
experimentally that the ultrafast disorder assisted lattice-phonon interaction,
rather than the electron-phonon coupling process, would play the key role in
the ultrafast thermal relaxation of the terahertz dynamics. Furthermore, the
cooling process features robustness which is independent on the pump wavelength
and external temperature. Our finding is expected to propose a considerable
possible cooling channel in CVD-graphene and to increase the hot electron

node representations to facilitate various downstream tasks, such as node
classification and link prediction. Existing heterogeneous graph learning
methods are primarily developed by following the propagation mechanism of node
representations. There are few efforts on studying the role of relations for
improving the learning of more fine-grained node representations. Indeed, it is
important to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations
and discern node representations with respect to different relation types. To
this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph
Neural Network, namely R-HGNN, to learn node representations on heterogeneous
graphs at a fine-grained level by considering relation-aware characteristics.
Specifically, a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to
learn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately.
Then, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the
interactions of node representations across different relations. Also, the
relation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation
semantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process.
Moreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware
node representations into a compact representation with the learned relation
representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of
graph learning tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing methods among all the tasks.

former predicts importance scores for all frames of a video while the latter

features. Specifically, the generator employs a fully convolutional sequence
network to extract global representation of a video, and an attention-based
network to output normalized importance scores. To learn the parameters, our
objective function is composed of three loss functions, which can guide the
frame-level importance score prediction collaboratively. To validate this

their merger rate peaks at a redshift smaller than that of the star formation
rate peak ($z_p \approx 2$), depending on the time delay between the formation

molecular column density of ethanolamine in interstellar space is
$N$=(1.51$\pm$0.07)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, implying a molecular abundance
with respect to H$_2$ of (0.9-1.4)$\times$10$^{-10}$. Previous studies reported
its presence in meteoritic material but they suggested that it is synthesized
in the meteorite itself by decomposition of amino acids. However, we find that
the proportion of the molecule with respect to water in the interstellar medium
is similar to the one found in the meteorite (10$^{-6}$). These results
indicate that ethanolamine forms efficiently in space and, if delivered onto

comprehensively and quantitatively verified by comparing with the prediction of
analytical models and a published x-ray imaging observation result, proving
that the model is quantitatively and morphologically accurate. After that, with
the temperature gradient and cooling rate extracted from a
finite-volume-method(FVM)-based thermal-fluid model, the model was applied in
reproducing the dendrite growth process of nickel-based superalloy during a

both image classification and natural language understanding tasks. Besides, in
the paradigm of first pre-training and then fine-tuning, we theoretically show

presence of schema constraints representing the domain of interest. Datalog+/-
is a common family of languages for schema constraints, including
tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) and equality-generating dependencies
(EGDs). The interplay of TGDs and EGDs leads to undecidability or
intractability of query answering when adding EGDs to tractable Datalog+/-
fragments, like Warded Datalog+/-, for which, in the sole presence of TGDs,
query answering is PTIME in data complexity. There have been attempts to limit
the interaction of TGDs and EGDs and guarantee tractability, in particular with
the introduction of separable EGDs, to make EGDs irrelevant for query answering
as long as the set of constraints is satisfied. While being tractable,
separable EGDs have limited expressive power.
  We propose a more general class of EGDs, which we call ""harmless"", that
subsume separable EGDs and allow to model a much broader class of problems.
Unlike separable EGDs, harmless EGDs, besides enforcing ground equality
constraints, specialize the query answer by grounding or renaming the labelled
nulls introduced by existential quantification in the TGDs. Harmless EGDs
capture the cases when the answer obtained in the presence of EGDs is less
general than the one obtained with TGDs only. We conclude that the theoretical
problem of deciding whether a set of constraints contains harmless EGDs is
undecidable. We contribute a sufficient syntactic condition characterizing
harmless EGDs, broad and useful in practice. We focus on Warded Datalog+/- with
harmless EGDs and argue that, in such fragment, query answering is decidable
and PTIME in data complexity. We study chase-based techniques for query
answering in Warded Datalog+/- with harmless EGDs, conducive to an efficient
algorithm to be implemented in state-of-the-art reasoners.

detailed theoretical models. In this work we investigate disc-planet
interactions using the PLUTO code to run 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations of
protoplanetary discs with embedded 30 M$_{\oplus}$ and 300 M$_{\oplus}$ planets
on both an inclined ($i = 2.86^{\circ}$) and non-inclined orbit, using an
$\alpha$-viscosity of $4 \times 10^{-3}$. We produce synthetic scattered-light
images of these discs at \emph{H-band} wavelengths using the radiative transfer
code RADMC3D. We find that while the surface density evolution in 2D and 3D
simulations of inclined and non-inclined planets remain fairly similar, their
observational appearance is remarkably different. Most of the features seen in
the synthetic \emph{H-band} images are connected to density variations of the
disc at around 3.3 scale heights above and below the midplane, which emphasizes
the need for 3D simulations. Planets on sustained orbital inclinations disrupt
the disc's upper-atmosphere and produce radically different observable features
and intensity profiles, including shadowing effects and intensity variation in
the order of 10-20 times the surrounding background. The vertical optical depth
to the disc midplane for \emph{H-band} wavelengths is $\tau \approx 20$ in the
disc gap created by the high-mass planet. We conclude that direct imaging of
planets embedded in the disc remains difficult to observe, even for massive
planets in the gap.

protoplanetary disks (PPDs). While there is extensive literature on the VSI in
the hydrodynamic limit, PPDs are expected to be magnetized and their extremely
low ionization fractions imply that non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
effects should be properly considered. To this end, we present linear analyses
of the VSI in magnetized disks with Ohmic resistivity. We primarily consider
toroidal magnetic fields, which are likely to dominate the field geometry in
PPDs. We perform vertically global and radially local analyses to capture
characteristic VSI modes with extended vertical structures. To focus on the
effect of magnetism, we use a locally isothermal equation of state. We find
that magnetism provides a stabilizing effect to dampen the VSI, with surface
modes, rather than body modes, being the first to vanish with increasing
magnetization. Subdued VSI modes can be revived by Ohmic resistivity, where
sufficient magnetic diffusion overcome magnetic stabilization, and hydrodynamic
results are recovered. We also briefly consider poloidal fields to account for
the magnetorotational instability (MRI), which may develop towards surface
layers in the outer parts of PPDs. The MRI grows efficiently at small radial
wavenumbers, in contrast to the VSI. When resistivity is considered, we find
the VSI dominates over the MRI for Ohmic Els\""{a}sser numbers $\lesssim 0.09$

activities, and crimes are ubiquitous and the data on such events carry
essential information about the underlying diffusion processes between
communities (e.g., regions, online user groups). Modeling diffusion processes
and predicting future events are crucial in many applications including
epidemic control, viral marketing, and predictive policing. Hawkes processes
offer a central tool for modeling the diffusion processes, in which the
influence from the past events is described by the triggering kernel. However,
the triggering kernel parameters, which govern how each community is influenced
by the past events, are assumed to be static over time. In the real world, the
diffusion processes depend not only on the influences from the past, but also
the current (time-evolving) states of the communities, e.g., people's awareness
of the disease and people's current interests. In this paper, we propose a
novel Hawkes process model that is able to capture the underlying dynamics of
community states behind the diffusion processes and predict the occurrences of
events based on the dynamics. Specifically, we model the latent dynamic
function that encodes these hidden dynamics by a mixture of neural networks.
Then we design the triggering kernel using the latent dynamic function and its
integral. The proposed method, termed DHP (Dynamic Hawkes Processes), offers a
flexible way to learn complex representations of the time-evolving communities'
states, while at the same time it allows to computing the exact likelihood,
which makes parameter learning tractable. Extensive experiments on four
real-world event datasets show that DHP outperforms five widely adopted methods
for event prediction.

the fact that the $\Xi^-\overline{\Xi}^+$ pair is entangled and sequentially

the $\Xi^-\to\Lambda\pi^-$ decay ($\alpha_{\Xi}$, $\phi_{\Xi}$) as well as the
$\overline{\Xi}^+\to\overline{\Lambda}\pi^+$ decay ($\overline{\alpha}_{\Xi}$,
$\overline{\phi}_{\Xi}$). From the decay parameters, two independent CP tests
were performed, quantified by the observables $A_{\rm CP}^{\Xi}$ and $\Delta
\phi_\Xi$. Our results, $A_{\rm CP}^{\Xi}$ = $(6.0\pm13.4\pm5.6)\times10^{-3}$

strong and weak $\Xi\to\Lambda\pi$ decay amplitudes. This results in the first
direct measurement of the weak phase difference for any baryon decay. The
result is found to be $(\xi_{P} - \xi_{S}) = (1.2\pm3.4\pm0.8)\times10^{-2}$
rad and is one of the most precise tests of CP symmetry for strange baryons.
The strong phase difference is measured to be $(\delta_P - \delta_S) =
(-4.0\pm3.3\pm1.7)\times10^{-2}$ rad. In addition, we provide an independent
measurement of the recently debated $\Lambda$ decay parameter,
$\alpha_{\Lambda} = 0.757 \pm 0.011 \pm 0.008 $. The

their resonant photonic environment and high refractive index, such as in
high-index dielectric metasurfaces. However, despite the sub-diffractive
operation of dielectric metasurfaces at the fundamental wave, this condition is
not fulfilled for the nonlinearly generated harmonic waves, thereby all
nonlinear metasurfaces to date emit multiple diffractive beams. Here, we
demonstrate the enhanced single-beam second- and third-harmonic generation in a
metasurface of crystalline transition-metal-dichalcogenide material, offering
the highest refractive index. We show that the interplay between the resonances
of the metasurface allows for tuning of the unidirectional second-harmonic
radiation in forward or backward direction, not possible in any bulk nonlinear
crystal. Our results open new opportunities for metasurface-based nonlinear
light-sources, including nonlinear mirrors and entangled-photon generation.

in these models in the dermatology space, it is crucial to address aspects such
as the robustness towards input data distribution shifts. Current skin disease
models could make incorrect inferences for test samples from different hardware
devices and clinical settings or unknown disease samples, which are
out-of-distribution (OOD) from the training samples. To this end, we propose a
simple yet effective approach that detect these OOD samples prior to making any
decision. The detection is performed via scanning in the latent space
representation (e.g., activations of the inner layers of any pre-trained skin
disease classifier). The input samples could also perturbed to maximise
divergence of OOD samples. We validate our ODD detection approach in two use
cases: 1) identify samples collected from different protocols, and 2) detect
samples from unknown disease classes. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of the proposed approach and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, data-driven dermatology applications may deepen the disparity in
clinical care across racial and ethnic groups since most datasets are reported
to suffer from bias in skin tone distribution. Therefore, we also evaluate the
fairness of these OOD detection methods across different skin tones. Our
experiments resulted in competitive performance across multiple datasets in
detecting OOD samples, which could be used (in the future) to design more
effective transfer learning techniques prior to inferring on these samples.

suppressed transverse-field (LSTF) protocol, a heuristic method for making
stoquastic optimization problems compatible with DQA. We show that, provided an
optimization problem intrinsically has magnetic frustration due to
inhomogeneous local fields, a target qubit in the problem can always be
manipulated to create a double minimum in the energy gap between the ground and
first excited states during the evolution of the algorithm. Such a double
energy minimum can be exploited to induce diabatic transitions to the first
excited state and back to the ground state. In addition to its relevance to
classical and quantum algorithmic speed-ups, the LSTF protocol enables DQA
proof-of-principle and physics experiments to be performed on existing
hardware, provided independent controls exist for the transverse qubit
magnetization fields. We discuss the implications on the coherence requirements
of the quantum annealing hardware when using the LSTF protocol, considering
specifically the cases of relaxation and dephasing. We show that the relaxation

  Joins in grafts, also known as $T$-joins in graphs, are a classical variant

generalizations of perfect matchings and graphs with perfect matchings,
respectively. Accordingly, graft analogues of fundamental concepts and results
from matching theory, such as canonical decompositions, will develop the theory
of minimum join. In this paper, we propose a new concept, critical quasicombs,

constructive characterization of critical quasicombs using a graft version of

variable source discoveries. The data deluge produced by these surveys has
necessitated the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms
to sift through the vast incoming data stream. A problem that arises in
real-world applications of learning algorithms for classification is imbalanced
data, where a class of objects within the data is underrepresented, leading to
a bias for over-represented classes in the ML and DL classifiers. We present a
recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier that takes in photometric time-series
data and additional contextual information (such as distance to nearby galaxies
and on-sky position) to produce real-time classification of objects observed by
the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO), and use an
algorithm-level approach for handling imbalance with a focal loss function. The
classifier is able to achieve an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.972 when
using all available photometric observations to classify variable stars,
supernovae, and active galactic nuclei. The RNN architecture allows us to
classify incomplete light curves, and measure how performance improves as more
observations are included. We also investigate the role that contextual
information plays in producing reliable object classification.

spatial-encoded regional pulmonary ventilation information on lung CT. Methods:
The lung volume was segmented on 46 CT images, and a 3D sliding window kernel
was implemented across the lung volume to capture the spatial-encoded image
information. Fifty-three radiomic features were extracted within the kernel,
resulting in a 4th order tensor object. As such, each voxel coordinate of the
original lung was represented as a 53-dimensional feature vector, such that
radiomic features could be viewed as feature maps within the lungs. To test the
technique as a potential pulmonary ventilation biomarker, the radiomic feature
maps were compared to paired functional images (Galligas PET or DTPA-SPECT)
based on Spearman correlation (r) analysis. Results: The radiomic feature map
GLRLM-based Run-Length Non-Uniformity and GLCOM-based Sum Average are found to
be highly correlated with the functional imaging. The achieved r (median
[range]) for the two features are 0.46 [0.05, 0.67] and 0.45 [0.21, 0.65]
across 46 patients and 2 functional imaging modalities, respectively.
Conclusions: The results provide evidence that local regions of sparsely
encoded heterogeneous lung parenchyma on CT are associated with diminished
radiotracer uptake and measured lung ventilation defects on PET/SPECT imaging.
These findings demonstrate the potential of radiomics to serve as a
complementary tool to the current lung quantification techniques and provide
hypothesis-generating data for future studies.

transportation of oil and gas has been the norm. Due to gravity differentiation
in horizontal wells and highly deviated wells (non-vertical wells), the water
phase at the bottom of the pipeline will cause scaling and corrosion in the
pipeline. Scaling and corrosion will make the transportation process difficult,
and transportation costs will be considerably increased. Therefore, the study
of the oil-water two-phase flow pattern is of great importance to oil
production. In this paper, a fuzzy inference system is used to predict the flow
pattern of the fluid, get the prediction result, and compares it with the
prediction result of the BP neural network. From the comparison of the results,
we found that the prediction results of the fuzzy inference system are more
accurate and reliable than the prediction results of the BP neural network. At
the same time, it can realize real-time monitoring and has less error control.
Experimental results demonstrate that in the entire production logging process
of non-vertical wells, the use of a fuzzy inference system to predict fluid
flow patterns can greatly save production costs while ensuring the safe
operation of production equipment.

consequences of Ramsey's theorem for pairs, focused on the chain-antichain
principle $\mathsf{CAC}$, the ascending-descending sequence principle
$\mathsf{ADS}$, and the Cohesive Ramsey Theorem for pairs $\mathsf{CRT}^2_2$.
We study these principles over the base theory $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$, which is
weaker than the usual base theory $\mathsf{RCA}_0$ considered in reverse
mathematics in that it allows only $\Delta^0_1$-induction as opposed to
$\Sigma^0_1$-induction. In $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$, it may happen that an unbounded
subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is not in bijective correspondence with $\mathbb{N}$.
Accordingly, Ramsey-theoretic principles split into at least two variants,
""normal"" and ""long"", depending on the sense in which the set witnessing the
principle is required to be infinite.
  We prove that the normal versions of our principles, like that of Ramsey's
theorem for pairs and two colours, are equivalent to their relativizations to
proper $\Sigma^0_1$-definable cuts. Because of this, they are all $\Pi^0_3$-
but not $\Pi^1_1$-conservative over $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$, and, in any model of
$\mathsf{RCA}^*_0 + \neg \mathsf{RCA}_0$, if they are true then they are
computably true relative to some set. The long versions exhibit one of two
behaviours: they either imply $\mathsf{RCA}_0$ over $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$ or are
$\Pi^0_3$-conservative over $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$. The conservation results are
obtained using a variant of the so-called grouping principle.
  We also show that the cohesion principle $\mathsf{COH}$, a strengthening of
$\mathsf{CRT}^2_2$, is never computably true in a model of $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$
and, as a consequence, does not follow from $\mathsf{RT}^2_2$ over
$\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$.

  the case of the German Tenant Electricity Law",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Involving residential actors in the energy transition is crucial for its
success. Local energy generation, consumption and trading are identified as
desirable forms of involvement, especially in energy communities. The
potentials for energy communities in the residential building stock are high
but are largely untapped in multi-family buildings. In many countries, rapidly
evolving legal frameworks aim at overcoming related barriers, e.g. ownership
structures, principal-agent problems and system complexity. But academic
literature is scarce regarding the techno-economic and environmental
implications of such complex frameworks. This paper develops a mixed-integer
linear program (MILP) optimisation model for assessing the implementation of
multi-energy systems in an energy community in multi-family buildings with a
special distinction between investor and user. The model is applied to the
German Tenant Electricity Law. Based on hourly demands from appliances, heating
and electric vehicles, the optimal energy system layout and dispatch are
determined. The results contain a rich set of performance indicators that
demonstrate how the legal framework affects the technologies' interdependencies
and economic viability of multi-energy system energy communities. Certain
economic technology combinations may fail to support national emissions
mitigation goals and lead to lock-ins in Europe's largest residential building
stock. The subsidies do not lead to the utilisation of a battery storage.
Despite this, self-sufficiency ratios of more than 90% are observable for
systems with combined heat and power plants and heat pumps. Public CO2
mitigation costs range between 147.5-272.8 EUR/tCO2. Finally, the results show
the strong influence of the heat demand on the system layout.

planar surfaces. From the intersection of planar surfaces arise straight lines.
Lines have more degrees-of-freedom than points. Thus, line-based
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) provides more information about the environment. In
this paper, we present solutions for SfM using lines, namely, incremental SfM.
These approaches consist of designing state observers for a camera's dynamical
visual system looking at a 3D line. We start by presenting a model that uses
spherical coordinates for representing the line's moment vector. We show that
this parameterization has singularities, and therefore we introduce a more
suitable model that considers the line's moment and shortest viewing ray.
Concerning the observers, we present two different methodologies. The first
uses a memory-less state-of-the-art framework for dynamic visual systems. Since
the previous states of the robotic agent are accessible -- while performing the
3D mapping of the environment -- the second approach aims at exploiting the use
of memory to improve the estimation accuracy and convergence speed. The two
models and the two observers are evaluated in simulation and real data, where
mobile and manipulator robots are used.

graphene systems with uniform or spatially-varying mass terms. Extrinsic

a promising route towards more complete experimental investigation of
valleytronic phenomena in graphene, but a major obstacle is the difficulty in
applying the sublattice-dependent potentials required. Here we show that
strongly valley-dependent scattering also emerges from bilayer graphene quantum
dots, where the gap size can be easily modulated using the interlayer
potentials in dual-gated devices. Robust valley-dependent scattering and
concomitant valley currents are observed for a range of systems, and we
investigate the role of dot size, mass strength and additional potential terms.
Finally, we note that a strong valley splitting of electronic current also
emerges when a biased bilayer dot is embedded in a single layer of graphene,
but that the effect is less robust than for a bilayer host. Our findings
suggest that bilayer graphene devices with custom mass profiles provide an
excellent platform for future valleytronic exploration of two-dimensional

interpreted as performing Bayesian inference upon its surrounding environment.
In this work, we examine in depth the assumptions required to derive the FEP in
the simplest possible set of systems -- weakly-coupled non-equilibrium linear
stochastic systems. Specifically, we explore (i) how general the requirements
imposed on the statistical structure of a system are and (ii) how informative
the FEP is about the behaviour of such systems. We discover that two
requirements of the FEP -- the Markov blanket condition (i.e. a statistical
boundary precluding direct coupling between internal and external states) and
stringent restrictions on its solenoidal flows (i.e. tendencies driving a
system out of equilibrium) -- are only valid for a very narrow space of
parameters. Suitable systems require an absence of perception-action
asymmetries that is highly unusual for living systems interacting with an
environment. More importantly, we observe that a mathematically central step in
the argument, connecting the behaviour of a system to variational inference,
relies on an implicit equivalence between the dynamics of the average states of
a system with the average of the dynamics of those states. This equivalence
does not hold in general even for linear systems, since it requires an
effective decoupling from the system's history of interactions. These
observations are critical for evaluating the generality and applicability of
the FEP and indicate the existence of significant problems of the theory in its
current form. These issues make the FEP, as it stands, not straightforwardly
applicable to the simple linear systems studied here and suggest that more
development is needed before the theory could be applied to the kind of complex
systems that describe living and cognitive processes.

nano-systems) are dramatically different from their macroscopic or genuine
microscopic (atomic) cousins. Microscopic molecular systems (with a few atoms)
obey a regular quantum dynamics (described by time dependent Schrodinger
equation), whereas in macroscopic systems with continuous energy spectra, one
can expect, also regular, although typically relaxation, dynamic behavior. The
topic of our paper is in-between these limits. System behavior becomes
non-trivial and manifests a sort of transitions between regular and chaotic
dynamics. We show that such dynamic transitions occur when the Loschmidt echo
time of life exceeds the typical recurrence cycle period. We illustrate this
behavior in the frame work of a few versions of the exactly solvable quantum
problem, proposed long ago by Zwanzig. It is based on the study of time
evolution of the initially prepared vibrational state coupled to a reservoir
with dense spectrum of its vibrational states. In the simplest version of the
Zwanzig model, the reservoir has an equidistant spectrum, and the system -
reservoir coupling matrix elements are independent of the reservoir states. We
generalize the model to include into consideration the coupling of the
initially prepared single state to system phonon excitations. The coupling
results to temperature dependent broadening and decay of the echo components.
Another generalization is to replace a single level by two states coupled to
the Zwanzig reservoir. We anticipate that the basic ideas inspiring our work
can be applied to a large variety of interesting for the applications
nano-systems (e.g., dissipative free propagation of excitations along molecular
chains, or as a model for exchange reactions).

that eventually leads to thermalization of local observables. This makes the
exact description of the dynamics complex despite the apparent simplicity of
(high-temperature) thermal states. For accurate but approximate simulations one
needs a way to keep track of essential (quantum) information while discarding
inessential one. To this end, we first introduce the concept of the information
lattice, which supplements the physical spatial lattice with an additional
dimension and where a local Hamiltonian gives rise to well defined locally
conserved von Neumann information current. This provides a convenient and
insightful way of capturing the flow, through time and space, of information
during quantum time evolution, and gives a distinct signature of when local
degrees of freedom decouple from long-range entanglement. As an example, we
describe such decoupling of local degrees of freedom for the mixed field
transverse Ising model. Building on this, we secondly construct algorithms to
time-evolve sets of local density matrices without any reference to a global
state. With the notion of information currents, we can motivate algorithms
based on the intuition that information for statistical reasons flow from small
to large scales. Using this guiding principle, we construct an algorithm that,
at worst, shows two-digit convergence in time-evolutions up to very late times
for diffusion process governed by the mixed field transverse Ising Hamiltonian.
While we focus on dynamics in 1D with nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians, the
algorithms do not essentially rely on these assumptions and can in principle be
generalized to higher dimensions and more complicated Hamiltonians.

estimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for
fine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To
that end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm
density at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to
generate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of
oil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that
covers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory.
Specifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves
counting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we
propose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most
relevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the
epistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it
possible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration.
Moreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily
parallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil
palm density map with $10\,$m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) , for all of
Indonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps
have a mean absolute error of $\pm$7.3 trees/$ha$, estimated from an
independent validation set. We also analyse density variations between
different states within a country and compare them to official estimates.
According to our estimates there are, in total, $>1.2$ billion oil palms in
Indonesia covering $>$15 million $ha$, and $>0.5$ billion oil palms in Malaysia
covering $>6$ million $ha$.

volatile inventory of terrestrial and super-Earth exoplanets and affect the
prospects for atmospheric observations. The global efficacy of these
mechanisms, however, hinges on the transfer of reduced iron from the molten
silicate mantle to the metal core. Scaling analysis indicates that turbulent
diffusion in the internal magma oceans of sub-Neptunes can kinetically entrain
liquid iron droplets and quench core formation. This suggests that the chemical
equilibration between core, mantle, and atmosphere may be energetically limited
by convective overturn in the magma flow. Hence, molten super-Earths possibly
retain a compositional memory of their accretion path. Redox control by magma
ocean circulation is positively correlated with planetary heat flow, internal
gravity, and planet size. The presence and speciation of remanent atmospheres,
surface mineralogy, and core mass fraction of atmosphere-stripped exoplanets
may thus constrain magma ocean dynamics.

wireless channel, and seek a MAC that (i) provides low mean delay, (ii) has
distributed control (i.e., there is no central scheduler), and (iii) does not
require explicit exchange of state information or control signals. The design
of such MAC protocols must keep in mind the need for contention access at light
traffic, and scheduled access in heavy traffic, leading to the long-standing
interest in hybrid, adaptive MACs.
  We first propose EZMAC, a simple extension of an existing decentralized,
hybrid MAC called ZMAC. Next, motivated by our results on delay and throughput
optimality in partially observed, constrained queuing networks, we develop
another decentralized MAC protocol that we term QZMAC. A method to improve the
short-term fairness of QZMAC is proposed and analysed, and the resulting
modified algorithm is shown to possess better fairness properties than QZMAC.
The theory developed to reduce delay is also shown to work %with different
traffic types (batch arrivals, for example) and even in the presence of
transmission errors and fast fading.
  Extensions to handle time critical traffic (alarms, for example) and hidden
nodes are also discussed. Practical implementation issues, such as handling
Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) errors, are outlined. We implement and
demonstrate the performance of QZMAC on a test bed consisting of CC2420 based
Crossbow telosB motes, running the 6TiSCH communication stack on the Contiki
operating system over the 2.4GHz ISM band.
  Finally, using simulations, we show that both protocols achieve mean delays
much lower than those achieved by ZMAC, and QZMAC provides mean delays very
close to the minimum achievable in this setting, i.e., that of the centralized
complete knowledge scheduler.

addition to playing a key role in pathological settings such as ischemia and
tumour development. Experimental findings in the past two decades have led to
the identification of a new mechanism of neovascularisation, cluster-based
vasculogenesis, during which endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) mobilised from
the bone marrow are capable of bridging distant vascular beds in a variety of
hypoxic settings in vivo. This process is characterised by the formation of EPC
clusters during its early stages and, while much progress has been made in
identifying various mechanisms underlying cluster formation, we are still far
from a comprehensive description of such spatio-temporal dynamics. In order to
achieve this, we propose a novel mathematical model of the early stages of
cluster-based vasculogenesis, comprising of a system of nonlocal partial
differential equations including key mechanisms such as endogenous chemotaxis,
matrix degradation, cell proliferation and cell-to-cell adhesion. We conduct a
linear stability analysis on the system, solve the equations numerically,
conduct a parametric analysis of the numerical solutions of the 1D problem to
investigate the role of underlying dynamics on the speed of cluster formation
and the size of clusters, and verify the key results of the parametric analysis
with simulations of the 2D problem. Our results, which qualitatively compare
with data from in vitro experiments, elucidate the complementary role played by
endogenous chemotaxis and matrix degradation in the formation of clusters, and
they indicate that previous approaches to the nonlocal modelling of
cell-to-cell adhesion, while they capture the aggregating effect of
cell-to-cell adhesion, are not sufficient to capture its stabilising effect on
clusters, and new continuum cell-adhesion modelling strategies are required.

systems and aperiodic order (the mathematical theory of quasicrystals). Two of
their most striking features are that they have low complexity (zero
topological entropy) and are uniquely ergodic. Random substitutions are a
generalisation of deterministic substitutions where the substituted image of a
letter is determined by a Markov process. In stark contrast to their
deterministic counterparts, subshifts of random substitutions often have
positive topological entropy, and support uncountably many ergodic measures.
The underlying Markov process singles out one of the ergodic measures, called
the frequency measure. Here, we develop new techniques for computing and
studying the entropy of these frequency measures. As an application of our
results, we obtain closed form formulas for the entropy of frequency measures
for a wide range of random substitution subshifts and show that in many cases
there exists a frequency measure of maximal entropy. Further, for a class of
random substitution subshifts, we prove that this measure is the unique measure
of maximal entropy. These subshifts do not satisfy Bowen's specification
property or the weaker specification property of Climenhaga and Thompson and
hence provide an interesting new class of intrinsically ergodic subshifts.

two challenges simultaneously. CGRE employs graph convolution networks to
propagate information from data-rich relation nodes to data-poor relation
nodes, and thus boosts the representation learning of long-tailed relations. To
further improve the noise immunity, a constraint-aware attention module is
designed in CGRE to integrate the constraint information. Extensive
experimental results indicate that CGRE achieves significant improvements over
the previous methods for both denoising and long-tailed relation extraction.

technique that is commonly used to obtain information about the physical and
chemical characteristics of photovoltaic devices. However, the non-standard
physical behaviour of perovskite solar cells (PSC), which are heavily
influenced by the motion of mobile ion vacancies, has hindered efforts to
obtain a consistent theory to interpret PSC impedance data. This work rectifies
this omission by deriving a simple analytic model of the impedance response of
a PSC from the underlying drift-diffusion model of charge carrier dynamics and
ion vacancy motion. Extremely good agreement is shown between the analytic
model and the much more complex drift-diffusion model in regimes (including

voltage $V_{oc}$. Both models show good qualitative agreement to experimental
IS data in the literature and predict many of the observed anomalous features
found in impedance measurements on PSCs, such as `the giant low frequency
capacitance` and `inductive arcs' in the Nyquist plots. Where the physical
properties of the PSC are already known the analytic model can be used to
predict the recombination current $j_{rec}$ and the high and low frequency
resistances and capacitances of the cell, $R_{HF}$, $C_{HF}$, $R_{LF}$ and
$C_{LF}$. In scenarios where the physical properties of the cell are unknown
the analytic model can also used to extract physical parameters from
experimental PSC impedance data. {A novel physical parameter of particular
significance to PSC physics is identified. This is termed the electronic
ideality factor, $n_{el}$, and (as opposed to the standard ideality factor) can
be used to deduce the dominant source of recombination in a PSC, independent of
its ionic properties.

Custom FaaS container support is gaining traction as it enables better control

providing rapid container provisioning introduces non-trivial challenges for
FaaS providers, since container provisioning is costly, and real-world FaaS

highly-scalable middleware system for accelerating FaaS container provisioning.
FaaSNet is driven by the workload and infrastructure requirements of the FaaS

Compute. FaaSNet enables scalable container provisioning via a lightweight,
adaptive function tree (FT) structure. FaaSNet uses an I/O efficient, on-demand

show that FaaSNet: (1) finishes provisioning 2500 function containers on 1000

time-consuming, requires highly-trained raters, and may suffer from high
inter-rater variability. Self-supervised learning strategies can leverage
unlabeled data for training.
  We developed an algorithm to simulate resections from preoperative magnetic

RC segmentation using our simulation method. We curated EPISURG, a dataset
comprising 430 postoperative and 268 preoperative MRIs from 430 refractory
epilepsy patients who underwent resective neurosurgery. We fine-tuned our model
on three small annotated datasets from different institutions and on the
annotated images in EPISURG, comprising 20, 33, 19 and 133 subjects.
  The model trained on data with simulated resections obtained median

(36.4), 74.9 (24.2) and 80.5 (18.7) for each of the four datasets. After

For comparison, inter-rater agreement between human annotators from our
previous study was 84.0 (9.9).

target is to generate the k best subsets of R such that the sum of their

implicit traversal of the required portion of G on demand is sufficient, which
obviously gets rid of the preprocessing step, thereby reducing the overall time

predictions to be made with a user-defined confidence level. They are able to
do this by outputting prediction sets, rather than simple point predictions.
The conformal predictor is valid in the sense that the accuracy of its
predictions is guaranteed to meet the confidence level, only assuming
exchangeability in the data. Since accuracy is guaranteed, the performance of a
conformal predictor is measured through the efficiency of the prediction sets.
Typically, a conformal predictor is built on an underlying machine learning
algorithm and hence its predictive power is inherited from this algorithm.
However, since the underlying machine learning algorithm is not trained with
the objective of minimizing predictive efficiency it means that the resulting
conformal predictor may be sub-optimal and not aligned sufficiently to this
objective. Hence, in this study we consider an approach to train the conformal
predictor directly with maximum predictive efficiency as the optimization
objective, and we focus specifically on the inductive conformal predictor for
classification. To do this, the conformal predictor is approximated by a
differentiable objective function and gradient descent used to optimize it. The
resulting parameter estimates are then passed to a proper inductive conformal
predictor to give valid prediction sets. We test the method on several real
world data sets and find that the method is promising and in most cases gives
improved predictive efficiency against a baseline conformal predictor.

each class into prompt tuning. We conduct experiments on relation
classification, a typical and complicated many-class classification task, and
the results show that PTR can significantly and consistently outperform

examples, we compute to the lowest perturbative order in $SU(N)$ YM theory the
ratios, $r_i$, of LO-nonplanar to planar contributions to the $2$-point
correlators in the orthogonal basis in the coordinate representation of the
gauge-invariant dimension-$8$ scalar operators and all the twist-$2$ operators.
We demonstrate that -- if $\frac{\gamma_0}{\beta_0}$ has no LO-nonplanar
contribution, with $\gamma_0$ and $\beta_0$ the one-loop coefficients of the
anomalous-dimension matrix and beta function respectively -- $r_i$ actually
coincides with the corresponding ratio in the large-$N$ expansion of the
RG-improved UV asymptotics of the $2$-point correlators, provided that a
certain canonical nonresonant diagonal renormalization scheme exists for the
corresponding operators. Contrary to the aforementioned scalar operators, for
the first $10^3$ twist-$2$ operators we actually verify the above conditions,
and we get the universal value $r_i=-\frac{1}{N^2}$. Hence, nonperturbatively
such $r_i$ must coincide with the UV asymptotics of the ratio of the glueball
self-energy loop to the glueball tree contribution to the $2$-point correlators

structure of the multi level coding (MLC). The transmit bits are divided into
opportunistic bit (OB) and conventional bit (CB), which are mapped to the lower
level- and higher level signal in parallel to the MLC, respectively. Because
the OB's mapping does not require signal power explicitly, the energy of the CB
modulated symbol can be doubled. As the result, the overall mutual information
of the proposed method is found higher than that of the conventional BPSK in
one dimensional case. Moreover, the extension of the method to the
two-complex-dimension shows the better performance over the QPSK. The numerical
results confirm this approach.

remained, which we analyzed to build a picture of the tendencies and problems
present in this research area, highlighting the computer vision methods,
staining techniques, evaluation metrics, and the availability of the used
datasets and computer code. As a result, we identified that the most used
methods in the analyzed works are deep learning-based (70 papers), while fewer
works employ classic computer vision only (101 papers). The most recurrent
metric used for classification and object detection was the accuracy (33 papers
and 5 papers), while for segmentation it was the Dice Similarity Coefficient
(38 papers). Regarding staining techniques, Papanicolaou was the most employed
one (130 papers), followed by H&E (20 papers) and Feulgen (5 papers). Twelve of
the datasets used in the papers are publicly available, with the DTU/Herlev
dataset being the most used one. We conclude that there still is a lack of

Taking advantage of the characteristic response of laser power to spectral
modes from the narrow laser-line filter, we demonstrate that high spectral
purity and low intensity noise of the diode can be simultaneously maintained by
an active feedback to the injected laser. Our method is intrinsically
cost-effective, and does not require bulky devices, such as Fabry-Perot
interferometers or wavemeters, to actively stabilize the diode laser. Based on
successful implementation of this method in our quantum gas experiments, it is
conceivable that our active stabilization will greatly simplify potential

conservative and it combines advantages of the modified method of

developments hit the fundamental problem of how to make computational devices

disappointing failures of AI research and it seems there is something we
computer scientists don't get about the nature of language. Of course
philosophers and linguists think quite differently about language and this
paper describes how we have taken ideas from other disciplines and implemented
them. The background to the work is to take seriously the notion of language as
action and look at what people actually do with language using the techniques
of Conversation Analysis. The observation has been that human communication is
(behind the scenes) about the management of social relations as well as the
(foregrounded) passing of information. To claim this is one thing but to
implement it requires a mechanism. The mechanism described here is based on the
notion of language being intentional - we think intentionally, talk about them
and recognise them in others - and cooperative in that we are compelled to help
out. The way we are compelled points to a solution to the ever present problem
of keeping the human on topic. The approach has led to a recent success in
which we significantly improve user satisfaction independent of task
completion. Talk Markup Language (TalkML) is a draft alternative to VoiceXML
that, we propose, greatly simplifies the scripting of interaction by providing
default behaviours for no input and not recognised speech events.

  $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras","33 pages",,,,"math.OA math.FA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Henkin functionals on non-commutative $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras have recently
emerged as a pivotal link between operator theory and complex function theory
in several variables. Our aim in this paper is characterize these functionals
through a notion of absolute continuity, inspired by a seminal theorem of Cole
and Range. To do this, we recast the problem as a question in non-commutative
measure theory. We develop a Glicksberg--K\""onig--Seever decomposition of the
dual space of a $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra into an absolutely continuous part and a
singular part, relative to a fixed convex subset of states. Leveraging this
tool, we show that Henkin functionals are absolutely continuous with respect to
the so-called analytic functionals if and only if a certain compatibility
condition is satisfied by the ambient weak-$*$ topology. In contrast with the
classical setting, the issue of stability under absolute continuity is not
automatic in this non-commutative framework, and we illustrate its key role in
sharpening our description of Henkin functionals. Our machinery yields new
insight when specialized to the multiplier algebras of the Drury--Arveson space
and of the Dirichlet space, and to Popescu's noncommutative disc algebra. As

desirable to improve both the uniformity of the source distribution and the
uniformity of the distribution of the position errors. It is also desirable to
include more sources with high redshift in the ICRF list. These sources may be
of interest for astrophysics. To select prospective new ICRF sources, the OCARS

applicable to a variable number of surrounding vehicles and eliminates the need
for manually pre-designed sorting rules, leading to higher representation
ability and generality. The proposed ESC method introduces a representation
neural network (NN) to encode each surrounding vehicle into an encoding vector,
and then adds these vectors to obtain the representation vector of the set of
surrounding vehicles. By concatenating the set representation with other
variables, such as indicators of the ego vehicle and road, we realize the
fixed-dimensional and permutation invariant state representation. This paper
has further proved that the proposed ESC method can realize the injective
representation if the output dimension of the representation NN is greater than
the number of variables of all surrounding vehicles. This means that by taking
the ESC representation as policy inputs, we can find the nearly optimal
representation NN and policy NN by simultaneously optimizing them using
gradient-based updating. Experiments demonstrate that compared with the
fixed-permutation representation method, the proposed method improves the
representation ability of the surrounding vehicles, and the corresponding
approximation error is reduced by 62.2%.

Consideration of the total angular momentum of correlated skipping electrons

define the skeletonlet as a few combinations of joint offsets grouped in terms

consists of a denoising phase and a locally aggregating phase. The denoising
phase detects the noisy action data and adjust it by replacing all the features

locally aggregating phase sums the difference between an offset feature of the

sequence. Finally, the SHA model which combines sparse representation with a

approach utilizes a versatile and extensible framework for the quantification
of a three-dimensional (3-D) voxelized crystal structure in the form of 2-point
spatial correlations of multiple atomic attributes and performs principal
component analysis to extract the low-dimensional features that could be used
to build surrogate models for material properties of interest. An application
of the proposed feature engineering framework is demonstrated on a case study
involving the prediction of the formation energies of crystalline compounds
using two vastly different surrogate model building strategies - local Gaussian
process regression and neural networks. Specifically, it is shown that the top
25 features (i.e., principal component scores) identified by the proposed
framework serve as good regressors for the formation energy of the crystalline
substance for both model building strategies.

considerably enhance heat transport in turbulent multiphase flows, namely by
using oleophilic walls. As a model system, we pick the
  Rayleigh-B\'enard setup, filled with an oil-water mixture. For oleophilic
walls, e.g. using only $10\%$ volume fraction of oil in water, we observe a
remarkable heat transport enhancement of more than $100\%$ as compared to the
pure water case. In contrast, for oleophobic walls, the enhancement is then
only about $20\%$ as compared to pure water. The physical explanation of the
highly-efficient heat transport for oleophilic walls is that thermal plumes
detach from the oil-rich boundary layer and are transported together with the
oil phase. In the bulk, the oil-water interface prevents the plumes to mix with
the turbulent water bulk. To confirm this physical picture, we show that the
minimum amount of oil to achieve the maximum heat transport is set by the
volume fraction of the thermal plumes. Our findings provide guidelines of how
to optimize heat transport in thermal turbulence. Moreover, the physical
insight of how coherent structures are coupled with one phase of a two-phase
system has very general applicability for controlling transport properties in
other turbulent multiphase flows.

In recent years combining RL with expressive, high-capacity neural network
models has led to impressive performance in a diverse range of domains.
However, dealing with the large state and action spaces often required for
problems in the real world still remains a significant challenge. In this paper
we introduce a new simulation environment, ""Gambit"", designed as a tool to
build scenarios that can drive RL research in a direction useful for military
analysis. Using this environment we focus on an abstracted and simplified room
clearance scenario, where a team of blue agents have to make their way through
a building and ensure that all rooms are cleared of (and remain clear) of enemy
red agents. We implement a multi-agent version of feudal hierarchical RL that
introduces a command hierarchy where a commander at the higher level sends
orders to multiple agents at the lower level who simply have to learn to follow
these orders. We find that breaking the task down in this way allows us to
solve a number of non-trivial floorplans that require the coordination of
multiple agents much more efficiently than the standard baseline RL algorithms
we compare with. We then go on to explore how qualitatively different behaviour
can emerge depending on what we prioritise in the agent's reward function (e.g.
clearing the building quickly vs. prioritising rescuing civilians).

transportation of angular momentum and dissipation of energy within hot,
ionized accretion discs. This instability is produced through the interactions
of a differentially rotating plasma with an embedded magnetic field. Like all
substances in nature, the plasma in an accretion disc has the potential to
become magnetically polarized when it interacts with the magnetic field. In
this paper, we study the effect of this magnetic susceptibility, parameterized
by $\chi_m$, on the MRI, specifically within the context of black hole
accretion. We find from a linear analysis within the Newtonian limit that the
minimum wavelength of the first unstable mode and the wavelength of the fastest
growing mode are shorter in paramagnetic ($\chi_m>0$) than in diamagnetic
($\chi_m<0$) discs, all other parameters being equal. Furthermore, the
magnetization parameter (ratio of gas to magnetic pressure) in the saturated
state should be smaller when the magnetic susceptibility is positive than when
it is negative. We confirm this latter prediction through a set of numerical
simulations of magnetically polarized black hole accretion discs. We
additionally find that the vertically integrated stress and mass accretion rate
are somewhat larger when the disc is paramagnetic than when it is diamagnetic.
If astrophysical discs are able to become magnetically polarized to any
significant degree, then our results would be relevant to properly interpreting
observations.

  We observe for most applications, it instead suffices to look at what we call
the ``mostly'' set disjointness problem, which changes case (2) to say there is
a unique element $j$ occurring in at least half of the sets, and the sets are
otherwise disjoint. This change gives us a much simpler proof of an

  \begin{itemize} \item for $\ell_2$-Heavy Hitters, any $O(1)$-pass streaming

generalized to range images and provides a relative yaw angle estimate between
pairs of scans. Based on such predictions, we tackle loop closure detection and
integrate our approach into an existing SLAM system to improve its mapping

loop closures surpassing the detection performance of state-of-the-art methods.

function of morphology are used to construct a SFR cosmography in the local

framework of message passing and aggregation. Such GNNs are incapable of
learning relative positions between graph nodes within a graph. To empower GNNs
with the awareness of node positions, some nodes are set as anchors. Then,
using the distances from a node to the anchors, GNNs can infer relative
positions between nodes. However, P-GNNs arbitrarily select anchors, leading to
compromising position-awareness and feature extraction. To eliminate this
compromise, we demonstrate that selecting evenly distributed and asymmetric

aggregate embeddings of all the nodes within a graph is NP-hard. Therefore,
devising efficient optimal algorithms in a deterministic approach is
practically not feasible. To ensure position-awareness and bypass

learning how to choose anchors in a back-propagatable fashion. Experiments
verify the effectiveness of PSGNNs against state-of-the-art GNNs, substantially

robustness properties, which can provably eliminate classes of evasion attacks
for most inputs, but not all inputs. Since data distribution shift is very
common in security applications, e.g., often observed for malware detection,
local robustness cannot guarantee that the property holds for unseen inputs at
the time of deploying the classifier. Therefore, it is more desirable to
enforce global robustness properties that hold for all inputs, which is
strictly stronger than local robustness.
  In this paper, we present a framework and tools for training classifiers that
satisfy global robustness properties. We define new notions of global
robustness that are more suitable for security classifiers. We design a novel
booster-fixer training framework to enforce global robustness properties. We
structure our classifier as an ensemble of logic rules and design a new
verifier to verify the properties. In our training algorithm, the booster
increases the classifier's capacity, and the fixer enforces verified global
robustness properties following counterexample guided inductive synthesis.
  We show that we can train classifiers to satisfy different global robustness
properties for three security datasets, and even multiple properties at the
same time, with modest impact on the classifier's performance. For example, we
train a Twitter spam account classifier to satisfy five global robustness
properties, with 5.4% decrease in true positive rate, and 0.1% increase in

study the probability that $C_{n,d}$ is $k$-neighborly in various
high-dimensional asymptotic regimes, i.e. when $n$, $d$, and possibly also $k$
diverge to $\infty$. There is an explicit formula for the expected number of
$k$-dimensional faces of $C_{n,d}$ which involves Stirling numbers of both
kinds. Motivated by this formula, we introduce a distribution, called the Lah

combinatorial interpretation of the Lah distribution in terms of random
compositions and records, and explicitly compute its factorial moments. Limit
theorems which we prove for the Lah distribution imply neighborliness
properties of $C_{n,d}$. This yields a new class of random polytopes exhibiting
phase transitions parallel to those discovered by Vershik and Sporyshev, Donoho

slowly, they spin down thanks to brake mechanisms, which are in fact still
subject of intense investigation in the literature. Since pulsars are usually
modelled as highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic
radiation out of their magnetic poles, it is reasonable to consider that the
spindown has to do with a magnetic brake. Although an interesting and simple
idea, a pure magnetic brake is not able to adequately account for the spindown
rate. Thus, many alternative spindown mechanisms appear in the literature,
among them the pulsar wind model, where a wind of particles coming from the
pulsar itself can carry part of its rotational kinetic energy. Such a spindown
mechanism depends critically on three parameters, namely, the dipole magnetic
field $B$, the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes $(\phi)$, and the
density of primary particles $(\zeta)$ of the pulsar's magnetosphere.
Differently from a series of articles in this subject, we consider for the
first time in the literature a statistical modelling which includes a
combination of a dipole magnetic and wind brakes. As a result, we are able to
constrain the above referred parameters in particular for Crab and Vela
pulsars.

be elucidated. This study demonstrates accurate predictions of the GB

lattice thermal conduction at four GB atomic structures using large-scale
perturbed molecular dynamics and phonon wave-packet simulations. The comparison
of these results indicates that the GB structure dependence of thermal

predict the future trends of some observations. Existing predictive models
typically ignore the inconsistencies and imperfections in heterogeneous data
while also failing to consider the (1) spatial correlations among monitoring

problems, this paper proposes a deep learning method for fusing heterogeneous
data collected from multiple monitoring points using graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to predict the future trends of some observations and evaluates
its effectiveness by applying it in an air quality predictions scenario. The
essential idea behind the proposed method is to (1) fuse the collected
heterogeneous data based on the locations of the monitoring points with regard
to their spatial correlations and (2) perform prediction based on global
information rather than local information. In the proposed method, first, we
assemble a fusion matrix using the proposed RBF-based fusion approach; second,
based on the fused data, we construct spatially and temporally correlated data
as inputs for the predictive model; finally, we employ the spatiotemporal graph
convolutional network (STGCN) to predict the future trends of some
observations. In the application scenario of air quality prediction, it is
observed that (1) the fused data derived from the RBF-based fusion approach
achieve satisfactory consistency; (2) the performances of the prediction models
based on fused data are better than those based on raw data; and (3) the STGCN

of a smart city. The true ingenuity of such an infrastructure lies in providing
the commuters with real-time information about citywide transports like public
buses, allowing her to pre-plan the travel. However, providing prior
information for transportation systems like public buses in real-time is
inherently challenging because of the diverse nature of different
stay-locations that a public bus stops. Although straightforward factors stay
duration, extracted from unimodal sources like GPS, at these locations look
erratic, a thorough analysis of public bus GPS trails for 720km of bus travels
at the city of Durgapur, a semi-urban city in India, reveals that several other
fine-grained contextual features can characterize these locations accurately.
Accordingly, we develop BuStop, a system for extracting and characterizing the
stay locations from multi-modal sensing using commuters' smartphones. Using
this multi-modal information BuStop extracts a set of granular contextual
features that allow the system to differentiate among the different
stay-location types. A thorough analysis of BuStop using the collected dataset
indicates that the system works with high accuracy in identifying different
stay locations like regular bus stops, random ad-hoc stops, stops due to
traffic congestion stops at traffic signals, and stops at sharp turns.
Additionally, we also develop a proof-of-concept setup on top of BuStop to
analyze the potential of the framework in predicting expected arrival time, a
critical piece of information required to pre-plan travel, at any given bus
stop. Subsequent analysis of the PoC framework, through simulation over the

more accurate arrival time predictions with deviations less than 60s from the
ground-truth arrival time.

smartphones is extremely difficult. To reduce energy dissipation during
wireless transmission in mobile scenarios, laser or narrow radio beams with
sophisticated tracking control are typically required. However, reaching the
necessary tracking accuracy and reliability is really difficult. In this paper,
inspired by the features of optical resonators and retroreflectors, we develop
an experiment on a self-aligned resonant beam charging system for long-distance
mobile power transfer. It exploits light resonances inside a
double-retroreflector-based spatially separated laser resonator (SSLR), which
eliminates the requirement for any kind of tracking control. Focal telecentric
cat's eye retroreflectors are employed here. The SSLR was investigated by both
theoretical calculation and experiment. We also well assembled the transmitter
and the receiver and demonstrated its application in mobile smartphone
charging. The results show that above 5-W optical power (also obtained more
than 0.6-W electrical power) transferring with negligible diffraction loss to a
few-centimeter-size receiver is realized while the receiver moves arbitrarily
within 2-m vertical distance and 6{\deg} field of view from the transmitter.
The maximum horizontal moving range is up to 18cm. This wireless charging
system empowers a smartphone in mobile operation with unlimited battery life
without the need for a cable.

architecture of ""space, air, ground and sea"". One of the most difficult part of
this architecture is the underwater information acquisition which need to
transmitt information cross the interface between water and air.In this
senario, ocean of things (OoT) will play an important role, because it can
serve as a hub connecting Internet of things (IoT) and Internet of underwater
things (IoUT). OoT device not only can collect data through underwater methods,
but also can utilize radio frequence over the air. For underwater
communications, underwater acoustic communications (UWA COMMs) is the most
effective way for OoT devices to exchange information, but it is always
tormented by doppler shift and synchronization errors. In this paper, in order
to overcome UWA tough conditions, a deep neural networks based receiver for
underwater acoustic chirp communication, called C-DNN, is proposed. Moreover,
to improve the performance of DL-model and solve the problem of model
generalization, we also proposed a novel federated meta learning (FML) enhanced
acoustic radio cooperative (ARC) framework, dubbed ARC/FML, to do transfer.
Particularly, tractable expressions are derived for the convergence rate of FML
in a wireless setting, accounting for effects from both scheduling ratio, local
epoch and the data amount on a single node.From our analysis and simulation
results, it is shown that, the proposed C-DNN can provide a better BER
performance and lower complexity than classical matched filter (MF) in
underwater acoustic communications scenario. The ARC/FML framework has good
convergence under a variety of channels than federated learning (FL). In
summary, the proposed ARC/FML for OoT is a promising scheme for information
exchange across water and air.

published in this journal, entitled `Dr. Bertlmann's socks in a quaternionic
world of ambidextral reality.' The geometrical framework presented in my paper
is based on a quaternionic 3-sphere, or S^3, taken as a model of the physical
space in which we are inescapably confined to perform all our experiments. The
framework intrinsically circumvents Bell's theorem by reproducing the singlet
correlations local-realistically, without resorting to backward causation,
superdeterminism, or any other conspiracy loophole. In this response, I
demonstrate point by point that, contrary to its claims, the critique has not
found any mistakes in my paper, either in the analytical model of the singlet
correlations or in its event-by-event numerical simulation based on Geometric
Algebra.

  Systems","6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Measurements of the propagation channel form the basis of all realistic
system performance evaluations, as foundation of statistical channel models or
to verify ray tracing. This is also true for the analysis of cell-free massive
multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) systems in real-world environments.
However, such experimental data are difficult to obtain, due to the complexity
and expense of deploying tens or hundreds of channel sounder nodes across the
wide area a CF-mMIMO system is expected to cover, especially when different
configurations and number of antennas are to be explored. In this paper, we
provide a novel method to measure channels for CF-mMIMO systems using a channel
sounder based on a drone, also known as a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
Such a method is efficient, flexible, simple, and low-cost, capturing channel
data from thousands of different access point (AP) locations within minutes. In
addition, we provide sample 3.5 GHz measurement results analyzing deployment
strategies for APs and make the data open source, so they may be used for
various other studies.

hot topic in computer network society. This document gives a mathematical model
for general network at the beginning, and then discrete control theory is
proposed as a key tool to design a new flow control algorithm to avoid
congestion in the high-speed computer network, the proposed algorithm ensures
stability of network system. The results of the simulation show that the
proposed method can adjust the sending speed and the queue level in the buffer
quickly and effectively. In addition, the method is easy to implement and apply
to high-speed computer network.
