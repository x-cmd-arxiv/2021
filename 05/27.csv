recently been established as a new platform for studying strong electron
correlations. In this paper, we study twisted graphene monolayers on trilayer
graphene and demonstrate that this system can host flat bands when the twist
angle is close to the magic-angle of 1.16$^\circ$. When monolayer graphene is
twisted on ABA trilayer graphene, the flat bands are not isolated, but are
intersected by a Dirac cone with a large Fermi velocity. In contrast, graphene
twisted on ABC trilayer graphene (denoted AtABC) exhibits a gap between flat
and remote bands. Since ABC trilayer graphene and twisted bilayer graphene are
known to host broken-symmetry phases, we further investigate the ostensibly
similar magic angle AtABC system. We study the effect of electron-electron
interactions in AtABC using both Hartree theory and an atomic Hubbard theory to
calculate the magnetic phase diagram as a function of doping, twist angle, and
perpendicular electric field. Our analysis reveals a rich variety of magnetic
orderings, including ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism, and demonstrates that a
perpendicular electric field makes AtABC more susceptible to magnetic ordering.

requirement for FD communication as the SI severely limits the performance of a

to form a suitable cancellation signal in the analog domain. Building upon a

by the antenna design, we are able to cancel the leaked signal by an additional
59 dB in the narrowband case, resulting in an overall SI suppression of 103 dB
without additional digital cancellation. The presented case study shows
promising performance to build an FD communication system on this foundation.

conceptual schema is optimised by applying a sequence of transformations. By
performing these optimisations on the conceptual schema, a large part of the
database optimisation can be done before actually sliding down the software

level of equivalence between the schemas before and after a transformation. We
distinguish between two classes of equivalence, one based on the mathematical
semantics of the conceptual schemas, and one on conceptual preference by
humans. As a medium for the schema transformations we use the universe of all
(correct) conceptual schemas. A schema transformation process can then be seen
as a journey (a schema-time worm) within this universe. The underlying theory
is conveyed intuitively with sample transformations, and formalised within the
framework of Object-Role Modelling. A metalanguage is introduced for the
specification of transformations, and more importantly their semantics. While
the discussion focusses on the data perspective, the approach has a high level
of generality and is extensible to process and behaviour perspectives.

erasure and re-entry into the low-temperature ground state leads to a spatial
reorganization of the AF modulations, indicating multiple stable AF
configurations at low temperature. Interestingly, regardless of this
rearrangement, the AF puddles maintain scale-invariant fractal geometry in each

implementations of information systems require a sound conceptualisation of

modelling techniques has depended largely on the adequacy of conceptualisation,
expressive power, comprehensibility and formal foundation. An equally important
requirement, particularly with the increased conceptualisation of business
aspects, is \EM{business suitability}. In this paper, the focus is on the
business suitability of workflow modelling for a commonly encountered class of
(operational) business processing, e.g. those of insurance claims, bank loans
and land conveyancing. A general assessment is first conducted on some
\EM{integrated} techniques characterising well-known paradigms - structured
process modelling, object-oriented modelling, behavioural process modelling and
business-oriented modelling. Through this, an insight into business suitability
within the broader perspective of technique adequacy, is gained. A specific
business suitability diagnosis then follows using a particular characterisation
of business processing, i.e.\ one where the intuitive semantics and
inter-relationship of business services and business processes are nuanced. As
a result, five business suitability principles are elicited. These are proposed
for a more detailed understanding and (synthetic) development of workflow
modelling techniques. Accordingly, further insight into workflow specification

of social interactions (connectivity, interactivity and language use), the
authors aim to provide VCoP managers with valuable insights to improve the

a period of seven years (April 2008 to April 2015) and between 14,000 members
of 16 different healthcare VCoPs coexisting on the same web platform were
analysed. Multilevel regression models were used to reveal the main
determinants of community growth over time. Independent variables were derived
from social network and semantic analysis measures. Findings: Results show that
structural and content-based variables predict the growth of the community.
Progressively, more people will join a community if its structure is more
centralised, leaders are more dynamic (they rotate more) and the language used
in the posts is less complex. Research limitations/implications: The available
data set included one Web platform and a limited number of control variables.
To consolidate the findings of the present study, the experiment should be
replicated on other healthcare VCoPs. Originality/value: The study provides
useful recommendations for setting up and nurturing the growth of professional
communities, considering, at the same time, the interaction patterns among the
community members, the dynamic evolution of these interactions and the use of
language. New analytical tools are presented, together with the use of
innovative interaction metrics, that can significantly influence community

habitat, pursue prey, escape from predators, or seek a mate. The grand scale of
biodiversity contributes to the great locomotory design and mode diversity.
Various creatures make use of legs, wings, fins and other means to move through
the world. In this report, we refer to the locomotion of general biological
species as biolocomotion. We present a computational approach to detect
biolocomotion in unprocessed video.
  Significantly, the motion exhibited by the body parts of a biological entity
to navigate through an environment can be modeled by a combination of an
overall positional advance with an overlaid asymmetric oscillatory pattern, a
distinctive signature that tends to be absent in non-biological objects in
locomotion. We exploit this key trait of positional advance with asymmetric
oscillation along with differences in an object's common motion (extrinsic
motion) and localized motion of its parts (intrinsic motion) to detect
biolocomotion. An algorithm is developed to measure the presence of these
traits in tracked objects to determine if they correspond to a biological
entity in locomotion. An alternative algorithm, based on generic features
combined with learning is assembled out of components from allied areas of
investigation, also is presented as a basis of comparison.
  A novel biolocomotion dataset encompassing a wide range of moving biological
and non-biological objects in natural settings is provided. Also, biolocomotion
annotations to an extant camouflage animals dataset are provided. Quantitative
results indicate that the proposed algorithm considerably outperforms the
alternative approach, supporting the hypothesis that biolocomotion can be
detected reliably based on its distinct signature of positional advance with
asymmetric oscillation and extrinsic/intrinsic motion dissimilarity.

and SKA1-MID-like simulations of 21cm foregrounds (including polarisation

possible to use GPR as a foreground removal technique in this context, and that
it is better suited in some cases to recover the HI power spectrum than
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), especially on small scales. GPR is
especially good at recovering the radial power spectrum, outperforming PCA when
considering the full bandwidth of our data. Both methods are worse at
recovering the transverse power spectrum, since they rely on frequency-only
covariance information. When halving our data along frequency, we find that GPR
performs better in the low frequency range, where foregrounds are brighter. It
performs worse than PCA when frequency channels are missing, to emulate RFI
flagging. We conclude that GPR is an excellent foreground removal option for
the case of single-dish, low redshift HI intensity mapping in the absence of
missing frequency channels. Our Python toolkit gpr4im and the data used in this

how prosody affects a parser that receives an entire dialogue turn as input (a
turn-based model), instead of gold standard pre-segmented SUs (an SU-based

using transcripts alone, the turn-based model has trouble segmenting SUs,
leading to worse parse performance than the SU-based model. However, prosody
can effectively replace gold standard SU boundaries: with prosody, the
turn-based model performs as well as the SU-based model (90.79 vs. 90.65 F1

cholerae, remains a major threat to public health with a yearly estimated
global burden of 2.9 million cases. Although the majority of existing models
for the disease focus on its population dynamics, it's important to link the
multiple scales of the disease to gain better perspectives on its spread and
control. In this study, we formulate an immuno-epidemiological model for
cholera linking the between-host and within-host dynamics of the disease. The
within-host model utilizes time-scale methods to differentiate the pathogen
dynamics from the dynamics of the immune response. Bifurcation analysis of the
within-host system reveals the necessary conditions for the existence of both
the Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations. Contrary to other within-host models,
the current approach allows for the elimination of the pathogen after a finite
time. The epidemic model takes into account the direct human-to-human
transmission route of the infection as well as the transmission via the
environment. It is represented by a dynamical system structured on the immune
status, which is a function derived from the within-host immune response. The
basic reproduction number is derived and the stability of equilibrium points
analysed. Analysis of the endemic equilibrium reveals additional constraints
that lead to its stability. Without loss of immunity, the endemic equilibrium,
if it exists, is globally asymptotically stable.

additive manufacturing. This work considers surface growth, in which mass is
added to the boundary of a continuum body from the ambient medium or from
within the body. In contrast to bulk growth in the interior, the description of
surface growth requires the addition of new continuum particles to the body.
This is challenging for standard continuum formulations for solids that are
meant for situations with a fixed amount of material. Recent approaches to
handle this have used time-evolving reference configurations.
  In this work, an Eulerian approach to this problem is formulated, enabling
the side-stepping of the issue of constructing the reference configuration.
However, this raises the complementary challenge of determining the stress
response of the solid, which typically requires the deformation gradient that
is not immediately available in the Eulerian formulation. To resolve this, the
approach introduces additional kinematic descriptors, namely the relaxed
zero-stress deformation and the elastic deformation; in contrast to the
deformation gradient, these have the important advantage that they are not
required to satisfy kinematic compatibility. The resulting model has only the
density, velocity, and elastic deformation as variables in the Eulerian
setting.
  The introduction in this formulation of the relaxed deformation and the
elastic deformation provides a description of surface growth whereby the added
material can bring in its own kinematic information. Loosely, the added
material ""brings in its own reference configuration"" through the specification
of the relaxed deformation and the elastic deformation of the added material.
This kinematic description enables, e.g., modeling of non-normal growth using a
standard normal growth velocity and a simple approach to prescribing boundary
conditions.

in three dimensions, commonly encountered while solving linear elliptic partial

potentials close to the boundary over which they are defined. The approach
introduced here converts these nearly-singular integrals on a patch of the
boundary to a set of non-singular line integrals on the patch boundary using
the Stokes theorem on manifolds. A function approximation scheme based on
harmonic polynomials is designed to express the integrand in a form that is
suitable for applying the Stokes theorem. As long as the data -- the boundary
and the density function -- is given in a high-order format, the double-layer
potential and its derivatives can be evaluated with high-order accuracy using
this scheme both on and off the boundary. In particular, we present numerical
results demonstrating seventh-order convergence on a smooth, warped torus

compression rates. However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse
matrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional
memory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of
unstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning
solutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient
implementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a
flexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different
granularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining
efficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for
every output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature
map). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP
leverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,
facilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive
compression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning
models trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.
Relevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization
of pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the
network, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic
metrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within
a layer.

is the largest -- about half of the total Amati-correlation GRBs -- current
collection of GRBs suitable for constraining cosmological parameters. This
updated GRB compilation has the smallest intrinsic dispersion of the three

collection of reliable bursts for current Combo-correlation GRB data.
Cosmological constraints determined from the A118 sample are consistent with --
but significantly weaker than -- those from BAO and $H(z)$ data. They also are
consistent with the spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM model as well as with dynamical
dark energy models and non-spatially-flat models. Since GRBs probe a largely

water systems, are composed of multiple components which are interconnected and
interdependent to produce and distribute essential goods and services. So, the
robustness of infrastructure systems to resist disturbances is crucial for the
durable performance of modern societies. Multilayer networks have been used to
model the multiplicity and interrelation of infrastructure systems and
percolation theory is the most common approach to quantify the robustness of
such networks. This survey systematically reviews literature published between
2010 and 2021, on applying percolation theory to assess the robustness of
infrastructure systems modeled as multilayer networks. We discussed all network
properties applied to build infrastructure models. Among all properties,
interdependency strength and communities were the most common network property
whilst very few studies considered realistic attributes of infrastructure
systems such as directed links and feedback conditions. The review highlights
that the properties produced approximately similar model outcomes, in terms of
detecting improvement or deterioration in the robustness of multilayer
infrastructure networks, with few exceptions. Most of the studies focused on
highly simpliffied synthetic models rather than models built by real datasets.
Thus, this review suggests analyzing multiple properties in a single model to
assess whether they boost or weaken the impact of each other. In addition, the
effect size of different properties on the robustness of infrastructure systems
should be quantiffied. It can support the design and planning of robust
infrastructure systems by arranging and prioritizing the most effective
properties.

$T_{eff}$. Here we combine large-scale simulations and an analytical
mode-coupling theory (MCT) for such systems and show that, in fact, an active
glass is inherently different from an equilibrium glass. Although the
relaxation dynamics can be equilibrium-like at a $T_{eff}$, the effects of
activity on the dynamical heterogeneity (DH), which has emerged as a
cornerstone of glassy dynamics, are quite nontrivial and complex. With no
preexisting data, we employ four distinct methods for reliable estimates of the
DH length scales. Our work shows active glasses exhibit dramatic growth of DH
and systems with similar relaxation times, and $T_{eff}$ can have widely
varying DH. To theoretically study DH, we extend active MCT and find excellent
agreement between the theory and simulation results. Our results question the
supposedly central role of DH in glassy dynamics and can have fundamental
significance even in equilibrium.

learning is typically applied with the assist of side-information provided by
experts, most commonly expressed in the form of cannot-link and must-link
constraints. In this setting, distance metric learning algorithms move closer
pairs of data points involved in must-link constraints, while pairs of points
involved in cannot-link constraints are moved away from each other. For these
algorithms to be effective, it is important to use a distance metric that
matches the expert knowledge, beliefs, and expectations, and the
transformations made to stick to the side-information should preserve
geometrical properties of the dataset. Also, it is interesting to filter the
constraints provided by the experts to keep only the most useful and reject
those that can harm the clustering process. To address these issues, we propose
to exploit the dual information associated with the pairwise constraints of the
semi-supervised clustering problem. Experiments clearly show that distance

setup in which the algorithm is provided a distribution defined over the
possible network sizes that predicts the likelihood of each size occurring. The
goal is to leverage the predictive power of this distribution to improve on
worst-case time complexity bounds. Using a novel connection between contention
resolution and information theory, we prove lower bounds on the expected time
complexity with respect to the Shannon entropy of the corresponding network
size random variable, for both the collision detection and no collision

assuming now that the distribution provided as input might differ from the
actual distribution generating network sizes. We express their performance with
respect to both entropy and the statistical divergence between the two
distributions -- allowing us to quantify the cost of poor predictions. Finally,
we turn our attention to the related perfect advice setting, parameterized with
a length $b\geq 0$, in which all active processes in a given execution are
provided the best possible $b$ bits of information about their network. We
provide tight bounds on the speed-up possible with respect to $b$ for

unconstrained. Originally, Psyche was considered to be almost entirely composed
of metal due to its high radar albedo and spectral similarities to iron
meteorites. More recent telescopic observations suggest the additional presence
of low-Fe pyroxene and exogenic carbonaceous chondrites on the asteroid's
surface. To better understand the abundances of these additional materials, we
investigated visible near-infrared (0.35 - 2.5 micron) spectral properties of
three-component laboratory mixtures of metal, low-Fe pyroxene, and carbonaceous
chondrite. We compared the band depths and spectral slopes of these mixtures to
the telescopic spectrum of (16) Psyche to constrain material abundances. We
find that the best matching mixture to Psyche consists of 82.5% metal, 7%
low-Fe pyroxene, and 10.5% carbonaceous by weight, suggesting that the asteroid
is less metallic than originally estimated (~94%). The relatively high
abundance of carbonaceous chondrite material estimated from our laboratory
experiments implies the delivery of this exogenic material through low velocity
collisions to Psyche's surface. Assuming that Psyche's surface is

the quality of a thermal camera image remains unaffected in similar conditions.
This paper proposes an end-to-end multimodal fusion model for pedestrian
detection using RGB and thermal images. Its novel spatio-contextual deep
network architecture is capable of exploiting the multimodal input efficiently.
It consists of two distinct deformable ResNeXt-50 encoders for feature
extraction from the two modalities. Fusion of these two encoded features takes
place inside a multimodal feature embedding module (MuFEm) consisting of
several groups of a pair of Graph Attention Network and a feature fusion unit.
The output of the last feature fusion unit of MuFEm is subsequently passed to
two CRFs for their spatial refinement. Further enhancement of the features is
achieved by applying channel-wise attention and extraction of contextual
information with the help of four RNNs traversing in four different directions.
Finally, these feature maps are used by a single-stage decoder to generate the
bounding box of each pedestrian and the score map. We have performed extensive
experiments of the proposed framework on three publicly available multimodal

formula for the velocity field for arbitrary background strain eigenvalues in
the stable region.
  The vortex surface cross-section has the form of four symmetric hyperbolic
sheets with a simple equation $|y| |x|^\mu =1$ in each quadrant of the tube
cross-section ($x y $ plane).
  We use the dilute gas approximation for the vorticity structures in a
turbulent flow, assuming their size is much smaller than the mean distance
between them.
  We introduce the Gaussian random background strain for each vortex surface as
an accumulation of a large number of small random contributions coming from
other surfaces far away. We compute this self-consistent background strain,
relating the variance of the strain to the energy dissipation rate.
  We find a universal asymmetric distribution for energy dissipation.
  A new phenomenon is a probability distribution of the shape of the profile of
the vortex tube in the $x y$ plane.
  This phenomenon naturally leads to imitation of the ""multi-fractal"" scaling
of the moments of velocity difference $v(\vec r_1) - \vec v(\vec r_2)$.
  These moments have a nontrivial dependence of $n, \log |r_1 - r_2|$,
approximating power laws with nonlinear index $\zeta(n)$. The rough estimate we
provide here is not matching the observed DNS data, which may indicate
necessity of the full 3D solution of the \CVS{} equations.
  We argue that the approximate relations for these moments suggested in a
recent paper by Sreenivasan and Yakhot are consistent with the \CVS{} theory.
We reinterpret their renormalization parameter $\alpha\approx 0.95$ in the
Bernoulli law $ p = - \frac{1}{2}\alpha \vec v^2$ as a probability to find no
vortex surface at a random point in space.

statins for primary prevention among older adults, and analysis of
observational data can add crucial information on the benefits of actual
patterns of use. Latent class growth models (LCGM) are increasingly proposed as
a solution to summarize the observed longitudinal treatment in a few distinct
groups. When combined with standard approaches like Cox proportional hazards
models, LCGM can fail to control time-dependent confounding bias because of
time-varying covariates that have a double role of confounders and mediators.
We propose to use LCGM to classify individuals into a few latent classes based
on their medication adherence pattern, then choose a working marginal
structural model (MSM) that relates the outcome to these groups. The parameter
of interest is nonparametrically defined as the projection of the true MSM onto
the chosen working model. The combination of LCGM with MSM is a convenient way
to describe treatment adherence and can effectively control time-dependent
confounding. Simulation studies were used to illustrate our approach and
compare it with unadjusted, baseline covariates-adjusted, time-varying
covariates adjusted and inverse probability of trajectory groups weighting
adjusted models. We found that our proposed approach yielded estimators with
little or no bias.

9 different SOIs. Without any parameter-tuning, the same model achieves

We find 18 $\mathrm{U(1)}$ spin liquids and 28 $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids that

virial-radius-wise contact halo pairs with mass ratios between 1/10 and 10 from
a set of cosmological $N$-body simulations. In the spin--orbit angle
distribution, we find a significant SOA in that 52.7%$\pm$0.2% of neighbors are
on the prograde orbit. The SOA of our sample is mainly driven by low-mass
target halos ($<10^{11.5}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) with close merging neighbors,
corroborating the notion that the tidal interaction is one of the physical
origins of SOA. We also examine the correlation of SOA with the adjacent
filament and find that halos closer to the filament show stronger SOA. Most
interestingly, we discover for the first time that halos with the spin parallel
to the filament experience most frequently the prograde-polar interaction
(i.e., fairly perpendicular but still prograde interaction; spin--orbit angle
$\sim$ 70$^{\circ}$). This instantly invokes the spin-flip event and the
prograde-polar interaction will soon flip the spin of the halo to align it with
the neighbor's orbital angular momentum. We propose that the SOA originates
from the local cosmic flow along the anisotropic large-scale structure,
especially that along the filament, and grows further by interactions with
neighbors.

correlations in the architecture of planetary systems. Exoplanets within a
system tend to be of similar size and mass, evenly spaced, and are often
ordered in size and mass. Small planets are frequently packed in tight
configurations, while large planets often have wider orbital spacing. Together,
these correlations are called the peas in a pod trends in the architecture of
planetary systems. In this paper these trends are investigated in theoretically
simulated planetary systems and compared with observations. Whether these
correlations emerge from astrophysical processes or the detection biases of the
transit method is examined. Synthetic planetary system were simulated using the
Generation III Bern Model. KOBE, a new computer code, simulates the geometrical
limitations of the transit method and applies the detection biases and
completeness of the Kepler survey. This allows simulated planetary systems to
be compared with observations.
  The architecture of synthetic planetary systems, observed via KOBE, show the
peas in a pod trends in good agreement with observations. These correlations
are also present in the theoretical underlying population, from the Bern Model,
indicating that these trends are probably of astrophysical origin. The physical
processes involved in planet formation are responsible for the emergence of
evenly spaced planets with similar sizes and masses. The size--mass similarity
trends are primordial and originate from the oligarchic growth of
protoplanetary embryos and the uniform growth of planets at early times. Later
stages in planet formation allows planets within a system to grow at different
rates, thereby decreasing these correlations. The spacing and packing
correlations are absent at early times and arise from dynamical interactions.

period out to at least $\sim$300 days. In this work we adopt and test the
hypothesis that the decrease in their occurrence towards the star is a result
of atmospheric mass loss, which can transform sub-Saturns into sub-Neptunes
($\lesssim$4$R_{\oplus}$) more efficiently at shorter periods. We show that
under the mass loss hypothesis, the sub-Saturn occurrence rate can be leveraged
to infer their underlying core mass function, and by extension that of gas
giants. We determine that lognormal core mass functions peaked near
$\sim$10--20$M_{\oplus}$ are compatible with the sub-Saturn period
distribution, the distribution of observationally-inferred sub-Saturn cores,
and gas accretion theories. Our theory predicts that close-in sub-Saturns
should be $\sim$50\% less common and $\sim$30\% more massive around rapidly
rotating stars; this should be directly testable for stars younger than
$\lesssim$500 Myr. We also predict that the sub-Jovian desert becomes less
pronounced and opens up at smaller orbital periods around M stars compared to
solar-type stars ($\sim$0.7 days vs.~$\sim$3 days). We demonstrate that
exceptionally low-density sub-Saturns, ""Super-Puffs"", can survive intense
hydrodynamic escape to the present day if they are born with even larger
atmospheres than they currently harbor; in this picture, Kepler 223 d began
with an envelope $\sim$1.5$\times$ the mass of its core and is currently losing
its envelope at a rate $\sim$2$\times 10^{-3}M_{\oplus}~\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$. If
the predictions from our theory are confirmed by observations, the core mass
function we predict can also serve to constrain core formation theories of
gas-rich planets.

formation simulations. In particular, we conduct numerical experiments
assessing both trends in galaxy properties in UVJ space and the color-color
evolution of massive galaxies as they quench at redshifts $z\sim 1$--$2$. We
find that our models broadly reproduce the observed UVJ diagram at $z=1$--$2$,
including (for the first time in a cosmological simulation) reproducing the
population of extremely dust-reddened galaxies in the top right of the UVJ

galaxies and do not produce as clear a bimodality between star-forming and
quiescent galaxies as is seen in observations. The former issue is due to an
excess of dust in low-mass galaxies and relatively gray attenuation curves in
high-mass galaxies, while the latter is due to the overpopulation of the green
valley in SIMBA. When investigating the time evolution of galaxies on the UVJ
diagram, we find that the quenching pathway on the UVJ diagram is independent
of the quenching timescale, and instead dependent primarily on the average
specific star formation rate in the 1 Gyr prior to the onset of quenching. Our
results support the interpretation of different quenching pathways as

abundance patterns and ages, derived from full-spectrum modeling, are examined
as a function of stellar mass ($M_*$) and size (i.e., half-light radius;
$R_e$). We find that both [Mg/H] and [Fe/H] do not vary with stellar mass but
are correlated with $M_*/R_e$ for quiescent galaxies with $M_*>10^{10.5}
M_\odot$. Thus, at fixed mass, compact quiescent galaxies are on average more
metal rich. This result reinforces the picture that supernova feedback and
gravitational potential regulate chemical enrichment. [Mg/Fe] does not vary
with $M_*$ or $M_*/R_e$, but there is a marginal positive relation between age
and mass. Our results support low-redshift findings that more massive galaxies
form their stars at earlier times. However, in contrast to low-redshift
studies, star formation timescale does not appear to depend on mass or size. We
also compare the mass-[Fe/H] and mass-[Mg/H] relations to stacks of quiescent
galaxies at $z\sim0$ and find that both relations increase by $\sim0.2$ dex
over the past 7 Gyr. Furthermore, at $z\sim0.7$ we find a clear trend with age,
such that older quiescent galaxies have lower metallicities. Both results can
be explained by a chemical evolution model in which galaxies quench via gas
removal. Future work, in particular with JWST/NIRSpec, will extend this
analysis to higher redshifts, allowing us to fully exploit abundance patterns
to study the formation histories of quiescent galaxies.

common examples of Abelian gauge theories, with and without matter. These rules
for extracting a continuum theory out of a lattice one represent an elementary
way to rigorously define continuum gauge theories. The focus is on (2+1)D but
the techniques developed here work in all dimensions.
  The first half of this paper is devoted to pure Maxwell theory. It is
precisely shown how continuum Maxwell theory emerges at low energies in an
appropriate parameter regime of the $\mathbb{Z}_K$ lattice gauge theory at
large $K$. The familiar features of this theory -- its OPE structure, the
distinction between compact and noncompact degrees of freedom, infrared
""particle-vortex"" dualities, and the Coulomb law behavior of its Wilson loop --
are all derived directly from the lattice.
  The rest of the paper studies gauge fields coupled to either bosonic or
fermionic matter. Scalar QED is analyzed at the same level of precision as pure
Maxwell theory, with new comments on its phase structure and its connections to
the topological BF theory. Ordinary QED (Dirac fermions coupled to Maxwell
theory) is constructed with an eye toward properly defining spinors and
avoiding global anomalies. The conventional continuum QED is shown to arise
from a specific restriction of the starting theory to smoothly varying fields.
Such smoothing also turns out to be a necessary condition for Chern-Simons
theory to arise from integrating out massive fermions in a path integral
framework. In an effort to find a canonical origin of Chern-Simons theory that
does not rely on path integral smoothing, a simple flux-attached lattice gauge
theory is shown to give rise to a Chern-Simons-like action in the confining
regime.

time-consuming task and imposes limitations to the problem sizes that can be
addressed. Similarly, algorithmic studies using adjacency matrices alone lack
the benefit of a visual representation of the states. We argue that applying
visual analytics to investigate graph states can be advantageous. To this end,
we introduce GraphStateVis, a web-based application for the visual analysis of
qubit graph states and their stabilizer groups. Our tool facilitates the
interactive construction of a graph through multiple components supported by
linking and brushing. The user can explore graph-state-specific properties,
including the Pauli-weight distribution of its stabilizer operators and noise
thresholds for entanglement criteria. We propose a use case in the context of
near-term quantum algorithms to illustrate the capabilities of our prototype.

  simulations of algorithms",,,,"quant-ph cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Symmetry is a unifying concept in physics. In quantum information and beyond,
it is known that quantum states possessing symmetry are not useful for certain
information-processing tasks. For example, states that commute with a
Hamiltonian realizing a time evolution are not useful for timekeeping during
that evolution, and bipartite states that are highly extendible are not
strongly entangled and thus not useful for basic tasks like teleportation.
Motivated by this perspective, this paper details several quantum algorithms
that test the symmetry of quantum states and channels. For the case of testing
Bose symmetry of a state, we show that there is a simple and efficient quantum
algorithm, while the tests for other kinds of symmetry rely on the aid of a
quantum prover. We prove that the acceptance probability of each algorithm is
equal to the maximum symmetric fidelity of the state being tested, thus giving
a firm operational meaning to these latter resource quantifiers. Special cases
of the algorithms test for incoherence or separability of quantum states. We
evaluate the performance of these algorithms on choice examples by using the
variational approach to quantum algorithms, replacing the quantum prover with a
parameterized circuit. We demonstrate this approach for numerous examples using
the IBM quantum noiseless and noisy simulators, and we observe that the
algorithms perform well in the noiseless case and exhibit noise resilience in
the noisy case. We also show that the maximum symmetric fidelities can be
calculated by semi-definite programs, which is useful for benchmarking the
performance of these algorithms for sufficiently small examples. Finally, we
establish various generalizations of the resource theory of asymmetry, with the
upshot being that the acceptance probabilities of the algorithms are resource
monotones and thus well motivated from the resource-theoretic perspective.

considered a convenient and efficient means of charging electric vehicles.
However, drivers are typically poor at aligning the vehicle to the necessary
accuracy for efficient inductive charging, making the automated alignment of
the two charging plates desirable. In parallel to the electrification of the
vehicular fleet, automated parking systems that make use of surround-view
camera systems are becoming increasingly popular. In this work, we propose a
system based on the surround-view camera architecture to detect, localize, and
automatically align the vehicle with the inductive chargepad. The visual design
of the chargepads is not standardized and not necessarily known beforehand.
Therefore, a system that relies on offline training will fail in some
situations. Thus, we propose a self-supervised online learning method that
leverages the driver's actions when manually aligning the vehicle with the
chargepad and combine it with weak supervision from semantic segmentation and
depth to learn a classifier to auto-annotate the chargepad in the video for
further training. In this way, when faced with a previously unseen chargepad,
the driver needs only manually align the vehicle a single time. As the
chargepad is flat on the ground, it is not easy to detect it from a distance.
Thus, we propose using a Visual SLAM pipeline to learn landmarks relative to
the chargepad to enable alignment from a greater range. We demonstrate the
working system on an automated vehicle as illustrated in the video at

  The 4-zone model has little to no effect on the measured total nebular

measure steeper central ionization gradients, higher volume-averaged ionization
parameters, and higher central T_e, n_e, and logU values. Traditional 3-zone
estimates of the ionization parameter can under-estimate the average log U by
up to 0.5 dex. Additionally, we find a model-independent dichotomy in the
abundance patterns, where the alpha/H-abundances are consistent but N/H, C/H,

photoionization models cannot reproduce the very-high-ionization emission lines

advantages over approaches in second quantization including faster convergence
to the continuum limit and the opportunity for practical simulations outside
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. However, as all prior work on quantum
simulation in first quantization has been limited to asymptotic analysis, it
has been impossible to compare the resources required for these approaches to
those for more commonly studied algorithms in second quantization. Here, we
analyze and optimize the resources required to implement two first quantized
quantum algorithms for chemistry from Babbush et al that realize block
encodings for the qubitization and interaction picture frameworks of Low et al.
The two algorithms we study enable simulation with gate complexities
$\tilde{\cal O}(\eta^{8/3}N^{1/3}t+\eta^{4/3}N^{2/3}t)$ and $\tilde{\cal
O}(\eta^{8/3} N^{1/3} t)$ where $\eta$ is the number of electrons, $N$ is the
number of plane wave basis functions, and $t$ is the duration of time-evolution
($t$ is inverse to target precision when the goal is to estimate energies). In
addition to providing the first explicit circuits and constant factors for any
first quantized simulation and introducing improvements which reduce circuit
complexity by about a thousandfold over naive implementations for modest sized
systems, we also describe new algorithms that asymptotically achieve the same
scaling in a real space representation. We assess the resources required to
simulate various molecules and materials and conclude that the qubitized
algorithm will often be more practical than the interaction picture algorithm.
We demonstrate that our qubitized algorithm often requires much less surface
code spacetime volume for simulating millions of plane waves than the best
second quantized algorithms require for simulating hundreds of Gaussian
orbitals.

has been recently explored for visual SLAM, but to the best of our knowledge no
work has been attempted to address DST for LiDAR scans. The problem is of
critical importance due to wide-spread adoption of LiDAR in Autonomous

  We develop DSLR, a deep generative model which learns a mapping between
dynamic scan to its static counterpart through an adversarially trained

  from Sparse Fourier Samples",,,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The importance of regularization has been well established in image
reconstruction -- which is the computational inversion of imaging forward model
-- with applications including deconvolution for microscopy, tomographic
reconstruction, magnetic resonance imaging, and so on. Originally, the primary
role of the regularization was to stabilize the computational inversion of the
imaging forward model against noise. However, a recent framework pioneered by
Donoho and others, known as compressive sensing, brought the role of
regularization beyond the stabilization of inversion. It established a
possibility that regularization can recover full images from highly
undersampled measurements. However, it was observed that the quality of
reconstruction yielded by compressive sensing methods falls abruptly when the
under-sampling and/or measurement noise goes beyond a certain threshold.
Recently developed learning-based methods are believed to outperform the
compressive sensing methods without a steep drop in the reconstruction quality
under such imaging conditions. However, the need for training data limits their
applicability. In this paper, we develop a regularization method that
outperforms compressive sensing methods as well as selected learning-based
methods, without any need for training data. The regularization is constructed
as a spatially varying weighted sum of first- and canonical second-order
derivatives, with the weights determined to be adaptive to the image structure;
the weights are determined such that the attenuation of sharp image features --
which is inevitable with the use of any regularization -- is significantly
reduced. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by performing
reconstruction on sparse Fourier samples simulated from a variety of MRI
images.

order to determine accurate de-focus information based on the
sparsity-of-gradient merit function. Further with the knowledge of de-focus
information, an iterative Fresnel zone phase retrieval algorithm using image
sparsity constraints can accurately estimate the quantitative phase information
associated with a single particle. The proposed methodology which can correct
for both de-focus and spherical aberrations is a deviation from the image
processing chain currently used in single particle cryoEM reconstructions. Our

applies uniformly to de-focused image data recorded using the traditional CCD

high payoff. This is not necessarily equivalent to creating looks with the
highest probability of success. In particular, the two most efficient shots in
the NBA - which are shots from the paint, i.e., extremely close to the basket,
and three-point shots from the corner, i.e., at least 22 feet apart - have
completely different spatial profiles when it comes to their distance from the
basket. The latter also means that they are pretty much at the opposing ends of
the spectrum when it comes to their probability of being made. Due to their
efficiency, these are the most sought after shots from the offense, while the
defense is trying to contain them. However, in order to contain them one needs
to first understand what makes them efficient in the first place and how they
are generated. In this study we focus on the corner three point shots and using
player tracking data we show that the main factor for their efficiency -
contrary to the belief from the sports mass media - is not the shorter distance
to the basket compared to three-point shots above the break, but rather the
fact that they are assisted at a very high rate (more than 90\%). Furthermore,
we analyze the movement of the shooter and his defender and find that more than
half of these shots involve a shooter anchored at the corner waiting for the
kick out pass. We finally define a simplified game between the offense and
defense in these situation and we find that the Nash Equilibrium supports
either committing to the corner shooter or to the drive to the basket, and not
lingering between the two, which is what we observed from the defenses in our
dataset.

posterior distribution estimates of the OD-coefficients, which describe the
relative proportions of passengers travelling between origin and destination
locations, via a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling procedure. We suggest two
different inference model formulations: the instantaneous-balance and
average-delay model. We discuss both models' sensitivity to various count
observation properties, and establish that the average-delay model is generally
more robust in determining the coefficient posteriors. The
instantaneous-balance model, however, requires lower resolution count
observations and produces comparably accurate estimates as the average-delay
model, pending that count observations are only moderately interfered by trend
fluctuations or the truncation of the observation window, and sufficient number
of dispersed data records are available. We demonstrate that the Bayesian
posterior distribution estimates provide quantifiable measures of the
estimation uncertainty and prediction quality of the model, whereas the point
estimates obtained from an alternative constrained quadratic programming
optimisation approach only provide the residual errors between the predictions
and observations. Moreover, the Bayesian approach proves more robust in scaling
to high-dimensional underdetermined problems. The Bayesian
instantaneous-balance OD-coefficient posteriors are determined for the New York
City (NYC) subway network, based on several years of entry and exit count
observations recorded at station turnstiles across the network. The
average-delay model proves intractable on the real-world test scenario, given
its computational time complexity and the incompleteness as well as coarseness
of the turnstile records.

neutrally buoyant body - immersed in a layer of stably stratified salt water.
By oscillating a piston inside a cylinder communicating with a narrow (in one
of its horizontal dimensions) vessel containing the stably stratified layer of
salt water, it is easy to periodically vary the hydrostatic pressure of the
fluid. The ludion or Cartesian diver, initially positioned at its equilibrium
height and free to move horizontally, can then oscillate vertically when forced
by the pressure oscillations. Depending on the ratio of the forcing frequency
to the Brunt-V\""{a}is\""{a}l\""{a} frequency of the stratified fluid, the ludion
can emit its own internal gravity waves that we measure by a classical Particle
Image Velocimetry technique. Our experimental results describe first the
resonance of the vertical motions of the ludion when excited at different
frequencies. A theoretical oscillator model is then derived taking into account
added mass and added friction coefficients and its predictions are compared to
the experimental data. Then, for the larger oscillation amplitudes, we observe
and describe a bifurcation towards free horizontal motions. Although the
internal gravity wave frequencies are affected by the Doppler shift induced by
the horizontal displacement velocities, it seems that, contrary to surface
waves associated with Couder walkers they are not the cause of the horizontal
swimming. This does not however, exclude possible interactions between the
ludion and internal gravity waves and possible hydrodynamic quantum analogies
to be explored in the future.

cloud by simulations. These simulations start with the Solar System being born
with planets and asteroids in a stellar cluster orbiting the Galactic center.
Upon ejection from its birth environment, we continue to follow the evolution
of the Solar System while it navigates the Galaxy as an isolated planetary
system. We conclude that the range in semi-major axis between 100au and several
10$^3$\,au still bears the signatures of the Sun being born in a
1000MSun/pc$^3$ star cluster, and that most of the outer Oort cloud formed
after the Solar System was ejected. The ejection of the Solar System, we argue,
happened between 20Myr and 50Myr after its birth. Trailing and leading trails
of asteroids and comets along the Sun's orbit in the Galactic potential are the
by-product of the formation of the Oort cloud. These arms are composed of
material that became unbound from the Solar System when the Oort cloud formed.
Today, the bulk of the material in the Oort cloud ($\sim 70$\%) originates from
the region in the circumstellar disk that was located between $\sim 15$\,au and
$\sim 35$\,au, near the current location of the ice giants and the Centaur
family of asteroids. According to our simulations, this population is
eradicated if the ice-giant planets are born in orbital resonance. Planet
migration or chaotic orbital reorganization occurring while the Solar System is
still a cluster member is, according to our model, inconsistent with the
presence of the Oort cloud. About half the inner Oort cloud, between 100 and
$10^4$\,au, and a quarter of the material in the outer Oort cloud, $\apgt
10^4$\,au, could be non-native to the Solar System but was captured from
free-floating debris in the cluster or from the circumstellar disk of other
stars in the birth cluster.

Predictive maintenance is a special case, where the anomaly represents a
failure that must be prevented. Related time-series research as outlier and
novelty detection or time-series classification does not apply to the concept
of an anomaly in this field, because they are not single points which have not
been seen previously and may not be precisely annotated. Moreover, due to the

proposal of the Preceding Window ROC, a generalisation for the calculation of
ROC curves for time-series scenarios. We also adapt the mechanism from a

emerged as a promising multiple-access scheme for these networks that would
allow realization of the target spectral efficiency and user fairness
requirements. The integration of NOMA in the widely adopted orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based VLC networks would require an
optimal resource allocation for the pair or the cluster of users sharing the
same subcarrier(s). In this paper, the max-min rate of a multi-cell indoor
centralized VLC network is maximized through optimizing user pairing,
subcarrier allocation, and power allocation. The joint complex optimization
problem is tackled using a low-complexity solution. At first, the user pairing
is assumed to follow the divide-and-next-largest-difference user-pairing

Then, subcarrier allocation and power allocation are solved iteratively through
both the Simulated Annealing (SA) meta-heuristic algorithm and the bisection

used in many applications such as industrial process, medical imaging analysis,

Object detection systems are trained on large image datasets. For applications
such as autonomous vehicles, it is crucial that the object detection system can
identify objects through multiple frames in video. There are many problems with
applying these systems to video. Shadows or changes in brightness that can
cause the system to incorrectly identify objects frame to frame and cause an
unintended system response. There are many neural networks that have been used
for object detection and if there was a way of connecting objects between
frames then these problems could be eliminated. For these neural networks to
get better at identifying objects in video, they need to be re-trained. A
dataset must be created with images that represent consecutive video frames and
have matching ground-truth layers. A method is proposed that can generate these
datasets. The ground-truth layer contains only moving objects. To generate this
layer, FlowNet2-Pytorch was used to create the flow mask using the novel
Magnitude Method. As well, a segmentation mask will be generated using networks
such as Mask R-CNN or Refinenet. These segmentation masks will contain all
objects detected in a frame. By comparing this segmentation mask to the flow
mask ground-truth layer, a loss function is generated. This loss function can
be used to train a neural network to be better at making consistent predictions
on video. The system was tested on multiple video samples and a loss was
generated for each frame, proving the Magnitude Method's ability to be used to

the pairing channel is considered at finite temperature. Within the Matsubara
formalism, the Dyson-type Bethe-Salpeter equation (Dyson-BSE) with the
frequency-dependent interaction kernel is obtained. Similarly to the case of
zero temperature, it is decomposed into the static and dynamical components,
where the former is given by the contraction of the bare interaction with the
two-fermion density and the latter is represented by the double contraction of
the four-fermion two-time correlation function, or propagator, with two
interaction matrix elements. The dynamical kernel with the four-body
propagator, being formally exact, requires approximations to avoid generating
prohibitively complicated hierarchy of equations. We focus on the approximation
where the dynamical interaction kernel is truncated on the level of two-body
correlation functions, neglecting the irreducible three-body and higher-rank
correlations. Such a truncation leads to the dynamical kernel with the coupling
between correlated fermionic pairs, which can be interpreted as emergent
bosonic quasibound states, or phonons, of normal and superfluid nature. The
latter ones are, thus, the mediators of the dynamical superfluid pairing. In
this framework, we obtained the closed system of equations for the fermionic
particle-hole and particle-particle propagators. This allows us to study the
temperature dependence of the pairing gap beyond the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
approximation, that is implemented for medium-heavy nuclear systems. The cases

for building inference accelerators optimized for specific datacenter-scale
workloads. We propose Full-stack Accelerator Search Technique (FAST), a
hardware accelerator search framework that defines a broad optimization
environment covering key design decisions within the hardware-software stack,
including hardware datapath, software scheduling, and compiler passes such as
operation fusion and tensor padding. In this paper, we analyze bottlenecks in
state-of-the-art vision and natural language processing (NLP) models, including
EfficientNet and BERT, and use FAST to design accelerators capable of
addressing these bottlenecks. FAST-generated accelerators optimized for single
workloads improve Perf/TDP by 3.7x on average across all benchmarks compared to
TPU-v3. A FAST-generated accelerator optimized for serving a suite of workloads
improves Perf/TDP by 2.4x on average compared to TPU-v3. Our return on
investment analysis shows that FAST-generated accelerators can potentially be
practical for moderate-sized datacenter deployments.

entropy of the Wigner function of the state. This quantity is properly defined
only for states that possess a positive Wigner function, which we name
Wigner-positive states, but we argue that it is a proper measure of quantum
uncertainty in phase space. It is invariant under symplectic transformations
(displacements, rotations, and squeezing) and we conjecture that it is lower
bounded by $\ln\pi +1$ within the convex set of Wigner-positive states. It
reaches this lower bound for Gaussian pure states, which are natural
minimum-uncertainty states. This conjecture bears a resemblance with the
Wehrl-Lieb conjecture, and we prove it over the subset of passive states of the
harmonic oscillator which are of particular relevance in quantum
thermodynamics. Along the way, we present a simple technique to build a broad
class of Wigner-positive states exploiting an optical beam splitter and reveal
an unexpectedly simple convex decomposition of extremal passive states. The
Wigner entropy is anticipated to be a significant physical quantity, for
example, in quantum optics where it allows us to establish a Wigner
entropy-power inequality. It also opens a way towards stronger entropic
uncertainty relations. Finally, we define the Wigner-R\'enyi entropy of
Wigner-positive states and conjecture an extended lower bound that is reached
for Gaussian pure states.

the incoherent critical metal phase generated by the Hubbard-type four-fermion
on-site random interactions which follow the Gaussian distribution. The SYK
behaviors here are similar to the $q=4$ SYK model except an additional factor
$N$. The phase transitions to the Fermi liquid regime and high temperature DMFT
insulting regime are possible through the turning of related parameters,
including the temperature, coherence scale, SYK coupling, and Coulomb boson
field. Taking the nonlocal Coulomb interaction (with pseudospin interaction) as
an example, we also discuss the existence of stable gapless bosonic excitations
in SYK compressible non-Fermi liquid phase away from the quantum critical point
(and thus prevent the condensation), which is due to the preserved SU(2) local
gauge symmetry in incoherent critical metal phase with strong SYK coupling and
at intermedia temperature. Note that here the compressibility plays the role of
effective coupling in the low-energy SYK bosonic action, and is a measurable
quantity in non-fermi liquid phase. We found that in this special case, the
global U(1) and U(1)$\otimes$U(1) symmetries are also preserved. Our results
are useful in detecting the effect of Hubbard parameter on the SYK behaviors in
non-Fermi liquid incoherent metal phase and how the on-site interacting model
enters the holographic picture at intermiedia and high temperature regimes, as
well as the relation between the phase transitions with the symmetry breaking.

(CHMM), which can effectively infer true labels from multi-source noisy labels
in an unsupervised way. CHMM enhances the classic hidden Markov model with the
contextual representation power of pre-trained language models. Specifically,
CHMM learns token-wise transition and emission probabilities from the BERT
embeddings of the input tokens to infer the latent true labels from noisy
observations. We further refine CHMM with an alternate-training approach
(CHMM-ALT). It fine-tunes a BERT-NER model with the labels inferred by CHMM,
and this BERT-NER's output is regarded as an additional weak source to train
the CHMM in return. Experiments on four NER benchmarks from various domains
show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised NER models

and are at the basis of many model-based clustering methods. In order to gain
additional flexibility, some model parameters can be expressed as functions of
concomitant covariates. In particular, component weights of the mixture can be
linked to the covariates through a multinomial logistic regression model, where
each component weight is a function of the linear predictor involving one or
more covariates. The proposed contribution extends this approach by replacing
the linear predictor, used for the component weights, with an additive
structure, where each term is a smooth function of the covariates considered.
An estimation procedure within the Bayesian paradigm is suggested. In
particular, a data augmentation scheme based on differenced random utility
models is exploited, and smoothness of the covariate effects is controlled by
suitable choices for the prior distributions of the spline coefficients. The
performance of the proposed methodology is investigated via simulation
experiments, and an application to an original dataset about UK parliamentary
votes on Brexit is discussed.

Schad et al. 2016 using observations acquired in the He I 10830 Angstrom

accelerating along a cooled coronal loop reaches peak speeds near 200 km
s$^{-1}$ and exhibits both high speed emission and absorption within the umbra,
which we determine to be a consequence of the strong height dependence of the
radiatively-controlled source function above the sunspot umbra. Strong emission
profiles close to the rest wavelengths but with long red-shifted tails are also
observed at the downflow terminus. From the polarized spectra, we infer
longitudinal magnetic field strengths of ${\sim}2.4$ kG in the core portion of
the He I strong emission, which we believe is the strongest ever reported in
this line. Photospheric field strengths along the same line-of-sight are
${\sim}2.8$ kG as inferred using the Ca I 10839 Angstrom spectral line. The
temperatures of the highest speed He I absorption and the near rest emission
are similar (${\sim}$10 kK), while a differential emission measure analysis
using SDO/AIA data indicates significant increases in radiative cooling for
temperatures between $\sim$0.5 and 1 MK plasma associated with the downflow
terminus. Combined we interpret these observations in the context of a strong
radiative shock induced by the supersonic downflow impacting the low sunspot

sacrifice power and performance for flexible hardware, or ASICs, which rapidly

accelerators have emerged as a promising middle-ground between these two
extremes, but such architectures have traditionally been difficult compiler
targets.
  The main obstacle is that these accelerators often use a different memory
abstraction than CPUs and GPUs: push memories that send a data stream from one
computation kernel to other kernels, possibly reordered. To address the
compilation challenges caused by push memories, we propose that the
representation of memory in the middle and backend of the compiler be altered

implemented efficiently on a programmable accelerator, and design a memory
mapping algorithm that combines polyhedral analysis and software vectorization
techniques to target our accelerator.
  Our evaluation shows that the compiler supports programmability while
maintaining high performance. It can compile a wide range of image processing

in the real NVP using a specific pattern to exchange information between two

the maintenance of exact invertibility, a full nonlinear update of all data

add augmented dimensions that act as a channel for communications among the

in two iterations. We also show that the augmented KRnet can be reformulated as
the discretization of a neural ODE, where the exact invertibility is kept such

attained much faster than chemical equilibrium, the former should be used as a
constraint explicitly in deriving the governing equations of time-evolution of
PFM order parameters. Current models for elastically anisotropic and
inhomogeneous media in the literature do not impose such a constraint in their
governing equations. In particular, they ignore the dependence of the total
strain on the order parameters while evaluating the variational derivative of
the elastic energy (VDEE). There is no mathematical proof to support this
treatment and the fundamental thermodynamic consistency of such a models could
be challenged. In this work, we present a rigorous and physically transparent

dynamics and phases of complex quantum systems with conserved charges. However,
some of their basic properties have not yet been understood. Recently, it has
been shown that such quantum circuits only generate a restricted subset of
symmetric unitary transformations [I. Marvian, Nature Physics, 2022]. In this
paper, we consider circuits with 2-local SU(d)-invariant unitaries acting on
qudits, i.e., d-dimensional quantum systems. Our results reveal a significant
distinction between the cases of d = 2 and d>2. For qubits with SU(2) symmetry,
arbitrary global rotationally-invariant unitaries can be generated with 2-local
ones, up to relative phases between the subspaces corresponding to inequivalent
irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetry, i.e., sectors with
different angular momenta. On the other hand, for d>2, in addition to similar
constraints on the relative phases between the irreps, locality also restricts
the generated unitaries inside these conserved subspaces. These constraints
impose conservation laws that hold for dynamics under 2-local SU(d)-invariant
unitaries, but are violated under general SU(d)-invariant unitaries. Based on
this result, we show that the distribution of unitaries generated by random
2-local SU(d)-invariant unitaries does not converge to the Haar measure over
the group of all SU(d)-invariant unitaries, and in fact, for d>2, is not even a
2-design for the Haar distribution.

association, as well as 73 low mass objects, members of the $\sigma$ Orionis
cluster, in order to explore the angular momentum evolution at early stages of
evolution, and its possible connection with main-sequence Ap/Bp magnetic stars.
Using FIES and HECTOCHELLE spectra, we obtain projected rotational velocities
through two independent methods. Individual masses, radii, and ages were
computed using evolutionary models, distance, and cluster extinction. Under the
assumption that similar physical processes operate in both, T Tauri and Herbig
Ae/Be stars, we construct snapshots of the protostar's rotation against mass
during the first 10 Myr with the aid of a rotational model that includes a
variable disc lifetime, changes in the stellar moment of inertia, a dipolar
magnetic field with variable strength, and angular momentum loss through
stellar winds powered by accretion. We use these snapshots, as well as the
rotational data, to infer a plausible scenario for the angular momentum
evolution. We find that magnetic field strengths of a few k$G$ at 3 Myr are
required to match the rotational velocities of both groups of stars. Models
with masses between 2-3 $M_{\odot}$ display larger angular momentum by a factor
of $\sim 3$, in comparison to stars of similar spectral types on the
main-sequence. Even though some quantitative estimates on this dramatic
decrease with age, for Ap/Bp magnetic main-sequence stars are presented, the
results obtained for the angular momentum evolution do not explain their low
rotation.

amount of endeavor required to generate expensive point-wise annotations for
fully supervised training. To alleviate manual efforts, we propose GIDSeg, a
novel approach that can simultaneously learn segmentation from sparse
annotations via reasoning global-regional structures and individual-vicinal
properties. GIDSeg depicts global- and individual- relation via a dynamic edge
convolution network coupled with a kernelized identity descriptor. The ensemble
effects are obtained by endowing a fine-grained receptive field to a
low-resolution voxelized map. In our GIDSeg, an adversarial learning module is
also designed to further enhance the conditional constraint of identity
descriptors within the joint feature distribution. Despite the apparent
simplicity, our proposed approach achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art for inferencing 3D dense segmentation with only sparse
annotations. Particularly, with $5\%$ annotations of raw data, GIDSeg
outperforms other 3D segmentation methods.

modeled as Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) matrices, and the geometric median
of a set of HPD matrices is interpreted as an estimate of the clutter
covariance matrix (CCM). Then, the problem of signal detection can be
reformulated as discriminating two points on the manifold of HPD matrices, one
of which is the HPD matrix in the cell under test while the other represents
the CCM. By manifold filter, we map a set of HPD matrices to another set of HPD
matrices by weighting them, that consequently improves the discriminative power
by reducing the intra-class distances while increasing the inter-class
distances. Three MIG median detectors are designed by resorting to three
geometric measures on the matrix manifold, and the corresponding geometric
medians are shown to be robust to outliers. Numerical simulations show the
advantage of the proposed MIG median detectors in comparison with their

estimate the conditional expectation of the outcomes given the index and a
generated regressor that depends on first-step estimates. In the third step, we
average derivatives of this conditional expectation to obtain a partial mean

lambda = -11.1+/-6.6 deg. Combined with the other available data, we find that
high obliquities are almost exclusively associated with planets that either
have an orbital separation greater than 10 stellar radii or orbit stars with
effective temperatures hotter than 6,000K. This pattern suggests that the
obliquities of the closest-orbiting giant planets around cooler stars have been
damped by tidal effects.

We consider a cooperative localization (CL) scenario where the mobile agents in

observations with other agents and by exchanging location information. A
traditional method for distributed CL in large agent networks is belief
propagation (BP) which is completely model-based and is known to suffer from
providing inconsistent (overconfident) estimates. The proposed approach
addresses these limitations by complementing BP with learned information
provided by a graph neural network (GNN). We demonstrate numerically that our

its computational complexity remains comparable to BP. Notably, more consistent
beliefs are obtained by not explicitly addressing overconfidence in the loss

semantics of networks. The networks considered are described by either internal
or enriched graphs. In the internal case we focus on $\mathsf{Q}$-nets, a
generalization of Petri nets based on a Lawvere theory $\mathsf{Q}$.
$\mathsf{Q}$-nets include many known variants of Petri nets including pre-nets,
integer nets, elementary net systems, and bounded nets. In the enriched case we
focus on graphs enriched in a quantale $R$ regarded as matrices with entries in
$R$. These $R$-matrices represent distance networks, Markov processes, capacity
networks, non-deterministic finite automata, simple graphs, and more. The
operational semantics of $\mathsf{Q}$-nets is constructed as an adjunction
between $\mathsf{Q}$-nets and categories internal to the category of models of
$\mathsf{Q}$. Similarly, the operational semantics of $R$-matrices is
constructed as an adjunction between $R$-matrices and categories enriched in
$R$. The left adjoint of this adjunction sends an $R$-matrix $M$ to the
$R$-category $F_R(M)$ whose hom-objects are solutions of the algebraic path
problem: a generalization of the shortest path problem to graphs weighted in
$R$. For both $\mathsf{Q}$-nets and $R$-matrices we use the theory of
structured cospans to study the compositionality of the above operational
semantics. For each type of network we construct a double category whose
morphisms are ""open networks"", i.e. networks with certain vertices designated
as input or output. We introduce the black-boxing of an open network, a
profunctor describing the externally observable behavior of an open network. We
introduce a class of open networks called ""functional open networks"" for which
black-boxing preserves composition.

Here, using the quantum Langevin equation, standard mean field theory and
adiabatic elimination, we investigate the quantum thermometry of a thermal bath
surrounding the atom with quantum optical probes. With the increase of coupling
strength between the atom and the cavity field, two kinds of singularities can
be observed. One type of singularity is the exceptional point (EP) in the
anti-parity-time (anti-$\mathcal{PT}$) symmetrical cavity field. The other type
of singularity is the critical point (CP) of phase transition from the normal

the CP, instead of the EP. And the direct photon detection represents an
excellent proxy for the optimal measurement near the CP. In the case where the
thermal bath to be tested is independent of the extra thermal bath interacting
with the cavity field, the estimation precision of the temperature always
increases with the coupling strength. Oppositely, if the thermal bath to be
tested is in equilibrium with the extra bath interacting with the cavity field,
noises that suppress the information of the temperature will be introduced when
increasing the coupling strength unless it is close to the CP.

This need is particularly great when working with sparse EEG montages (1-6

classical machine learning models nor deep neural networks trained end-to-end
on EEG are typically designed or tested for robustness to corruption, and
especially to randomly missing channels. While some studies have proposed
strategies for using data with missing channels, these approaches are not

wearables, cell phones). To tackle this problem, we propose dynamic spatial
filtering (DSF), a multi-head attention module that can be plugged in before
the first layer of a neural network to handle missing EEG channels by learning
to focus on good channels and to ignore bad ones. We tested DSF on public EEG
data encompassing ~4,000 recordings with simulated channel corruption and on a
private dataset of ~100 at-home recordings of mobile EEG with natural
corruption. Our proposed approach achieves the same performance as baseline
models when no noise is applied, but outperforms baselines by as much as 29.4%
accuracy when significant channel corruption is present. Moreover, DSF outputs
are interpretable, making it possible to monitor channel importance in

missing data depend crucially on correct identification of the underlying
missingness mechanism. Although the problem of testing whether this mechanism
is MCAR or MAR has been extensively studied, there has been very little
research on testing MAR versus MNAR.A critical challenge that is faced when
dealing with this problem is the issue of model identification under MNAR. In
this paper, under a logistic model for the missing probability, we develop two
score tests for the problem of whether the missingness mechanism is MAR or MNAR
under a parametric model and a semiparametric location model on the regression
function. The score tests require only parameter estimation under the null MAR
assumption, which completely circumvents the identification issue. Our

labels. Acquiring well-representative labels requires expert knowledge and
exhaustive labors. In this paper, we aim to boost the performance of
semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation with limited labels
using a self-ensembling contrastive learning technique. To this end, we propose
to train an encoder-decoder network at image-level with small amounts of
labeled images, and more importantly, we learn latent representations directly
at feature-level by imposing contrastive loss on unlabeled images. This method
strengthens intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, so as to get
a better pixel classifier. Moreover, we devise a student encoder for online
learning and an exponential moving average version of it, called teacher
encoder, to improve the performance iteratively in a self-ensembling manner. To
construct contrastive samples with unlabeled images, two sampling strategies
that exploit structure similarity across medical images and utilize
pseudo-labels for construction, termed region-aware and anatomical-aware
contrastive sampling, are investigated. We conduct extensive experiments on an
MRI and a CT segmentation dataset and demonstrate that in a limited label
setting, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover,
the anatomical-aware strategy that prepares contrastive samples on-the-fly
using pseudo-labels realizes better contrastive regularization on feature
representations.

  Motivated by a conjecture proposed by \'Ad\'am in 1967, CI-groups and
DCI-groups have been actively studied during the last fifty years by many

the classification of cyclic CI-groups and DCI-groups, and recently, the first
two authors, among others, classified cyclic NCI-groups and NDCI-groups. Even
though there are many partial results on dihedral CI-groups and DCI-groups,
their classification is still elusive. In this paper, we prove that a dihedral
group of order $2n$ is a NCI-group or a NDCI-group if and only if $n=2,4$ or
$n$ is odd. As a direct consequence, we have that if a dihedral group $D_{2n}$
of order $2n$ is a DCI-group then $n=2$ or $n$ is odd-square-free, and that if
$D_{2n}$ is a CI-group then $n=2,9$ or $n$ is odd-square-free, throwing some
new light on classification of dihedral CI-groups and DCI-groups.

devoted to another example: the effect of RSD on the apparent peculiar motions
of tracers as inferred from their positions in redshift space (i.e. the
observed distance). Our theoretical study is motivated by practical
considerations, mainly, the direct estimation of the velocity power spectrum,
which is preferably carried out using the tracer's redshift-space position (so
as to avoid uncertainties in distance measurements). We formulate the
redshift-space velocity field and show that RSD enters as a higher-order

to the usual perfect-fluid description of dark matter. We show that the effect
on the power spectrum is a damping on relatively large, quasilinear scales
($k>0.01\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), as was observed, though unexplained, in $N$-body
simulations elsewhere. This paper presents two power spectrum models for the
peculiar velocity field in redshift space, both of which can be considered
velocity analogues of existing clustering models. In particular, we show that
the ""Finger-of-God"" effect, while also present in the velocity field, cannot be

paper proposes a SDN-based runtime security enforcement approach for privacy
preservation of dynamic Web service composition. The main idea of this approach
is that the owner of service composition leverages the security policy model
(SPM) to define the access control relationships that service composition must
comply with in the application plane, then SPM model is transformed into the
low-level security policy model (RSPM) containing the information of SDN data
plane, and RSPM model is uploaded into the SDN controller. After uploading, the
virtual machine access control algorithm integrated in the SDN controller
monitors all of access requests towards service composition at runtime. Only
the access requests that meet the definition of RSPM model can be forwarded to
the target terminal. Any access requests that do not meet the definition of
RSPM model will be automatically blocked by Openflow switches or deleted by SDN
controller, Thus, this approach can effectively solve the problems of
network-layer illegal accesses, identity theft attacks and service leakages
when Web service composition is running. In order to verify the feasibility of
this approach, this paper implements an experimental system by using POX
controller and Mininet virtual network simulator, and evaluates the
effectiveness and performance of this approach by using this system. The final
experimental results show that the method is completely effective, and the
method can always get the correct calculation results in an acceptable time
when the scale of RSPM model is gradually increasing.

progress in semantic segmentation. Existing methods either align different
domains with adversarial training or involve the self-learning that utilizes
pseudo labels to conduct supervised training. The former always suffers from
the unstable training caused by adversarial training and only focuses on the
inter-domain gap that ignores intra-domain knowledge. The latter tends to put
overconfident label prediction on wrong categories, which propagates errors to
more samples. To solve these problems, we propose a two-stage adaptive semantic
segmentation method based on the local Lipschitz constraint that satisfies both
domain alignment and domain-specific exploration under a unified principle. In
the first stage, we propose the local Lipschitzness regularization as the
objective function to align different domains by exploiting intra-domain
knowledge, which explores a promising direction for non-adversarial adaptive
semantic segmentation. In the second stage, we use the local Lipschitzness
regularization to estimate the probability of satisfying Lipschitzness for each
pixel, and then dynamically sets the threshold of pseudo labels to conduct
self-learning. Such dynamical self-learning effectively avoids the error
propagation caused by noisy labels. Optimization in both stages is based on the
same principle, i.e., the local Lipschitz constraint, so that the knowledge
learned in the first stage can be maintained in the second stage. Further, due
to the model-agnostic property, our method can easily adapt to any CNN-based
semantic segmentation networks. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent
performance of our method on standard benchmarks.

dispersion in absolute drift difference between two fibers (inter-fiber drift)

The corresponding Green's functions satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions on

(i.e. the vacuum expectation value of the normal-normal component of the
stress-energy tensor) as a suitable second-order differential operator acting
on the corresponding Green's functions at coincident arguments. The divergences
are regulated by making use of zeta function techniques, and our results are
successfully compared with the Lorentz invariant case. Numerical calculations
are carried out for the Casimir pressure as a function of the Lorentz-violating

presented as well. It turns out that the Casimir pressure strongly depends on
the Lorentz-violating coefficient and it tends to diminish the force.

First-order methods must typically be instantiated with a regularizer that
serves as a distance-generating function for the decision sets of the players.
For the case of two-player zero-sum games, the state-of-the-art theoretical
convergence rate for Nash equilibrium is achieved by using the dilated entropy
function. In this paper, we introduce a new entropy-based distance-generating
function for two-player zero-sum games, and show that this function achieves
significantly better strong convexity properties than the dilated entropy,
while maintaining the same easily-implemented closed-form proximal mapping.
Extensive numerical simulations show that these superior theoretical properties
translate into better numerical performance as well. We then generalize our new
entropy distance function, as well as general dilated distance functions, to
the scaled extension operator. The scaled extension operator is a way to
recursively construct convex sets, which generalizes the decision polytope of
extensive-form games, as well as the convex polytopes corresponding to
correlated and team equilibria. By instantiating first-order methods with our
regularizers, we develop the first accelerated first-order methods for
computing correlated equilibra and ex-ante coordinated team equilibria. Our
methods have a guaranteed $1/T$ rate of convergence, along with linear-time
proximal updates.

typically consist of slow parts -- in which the associated solution follows an
orbit on a slow manifold in a reduced spatial dynamical system -- alternated by
fast excursions -- in which the solution jumps from one slow manifold to
another, or back to the original slow manifold. In this paper we consider the
existence and stability of stationary and traveling slow localized patterns
that do not exhibit such jumps, i.e. that are completely embedded in a slow
manifold of the singularly perturbed spatial dynamical system. These patterns
have rarely been considered in the literature, for two reasons: (i) in the
classical Gray-Scott/Gierer-Meinhardt type models that dominate the literature,
the flow on the slow manifold is typically linear and thus cannot exhibit
homoclinic pulse or heteroclinic front solutions; (ii) the slow manifolds
occurring in the literature are typically `vertical' -- i.e. given by $u \equiv
u_0$, where $u$ is the fast variable -- so that the stability problem is
determined by a simple (decoupled) scalar equation. The present research
concerns a general system of singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations
and is motivated by several explicit ecosystem models that do give rise to
non-vertical normally hyperbolic slow manifolds on which the flow may exhibit
both homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits -- that correspond to either stationary
or traveling localized patterns. The associated spectral stability problems are
at leading order given by a nonlinear, but scalar, eigenvalue problem with
Sturm-Liouville characteristics and we establish that homoclinic pulse patterns
are typically unstable, while heteroclinic fronts can either be stable or
unstable. However, we also show that homoclinic pulse patterns that are
asymptotically close to a heteroclinic cycle may be stable.

genotype-to-phenotype mapping for evolutionary search. Much previous work
applying GANs to level generation focuses on fixed-size segments combined into

contrast, segments in human designed levels are often repeated, directly or
with variation, and organized into patterns (the symmetric eagle in Level 1 of
The Legend of Zelda, or repeated pipe motifs in Super Mario Bros). Such
patterns can be produced with Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs).
CPPNs define latent vector GAN inputs as a function of geometry, organizing
segments output by a GAN into complete levels. However, collections of latent
vectors can also be evolved directly, producing more chaotic levels. We propose
a hybrid approach that evolves CPPNs first, but allows latent vectors to evolve
later, combining the benefits of both approaches. These approaches are
evaluated in Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. We previously
demonstrated via a Quality-Diversity algorithm that CPPNs better cover the
space of possible levels than directly evolved levels. Here, we show that the

practical limitations on the angular acceptance and size of GAZELLE,
effectively making it at most comparable to Belle II, even though backgrounds

Backbone design and fusion design have always been two essential parts of

semantic segmentation without any pre-training. To achieve this goal, a
encoder-decoder architectures are proposed to solve this problem by applying a
decoder network onto a backbone model designed for real-time segmentation tasks

the aggregation phase. We have conducted extensive experiments on two semantic
segmentation benchmarks. Experiments on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets show
that the proposed FRFNet strikes a balance between speed calculation and

this paper, we design a novel protocol that can effectively analyze the

hurt the whole performance of knowledge distillation. Finally, to address these

confined brain regions during unimodal tasks. Here we report on brain-wide

searched for their global organization as spatio-temporal patterns of
activation sequences between distant neural populations. We focused our
analysis on two types of spatio-temporal patterns: the most frequently
repeating patterns and the most discriminative patterns, to concentrate on
patterns with high relevancy to behavior. The findings revealed that global
temporally precise sequences can be found and that these sequences have
partially stereotypical characteristics, both temporally and spatially, with
consistent properties across subjects. By implementing a simplistic
single-trial decoding approach, we found that brain-wide sequences have a
temporal precision of 17-31 milliseconds, which resembles the temporal

bias towards strategic deviations that give a higher improvement in cost. It is
used extensively in practice. In congestion (or potential) games, the dynamics
converges to the so-called Gibbs distribution over the set of all strategy
profiles, when interpreted as a Markov chain. In general, logit dynamics might
converge slowly to the Gibbs distribution, but beyond that, not much is known
about their algorithmic aspects, nor that of the Gibbs distribution. In this
work, we are interested in the following two questions for congestion games: i)
Is there an efficient algorithm for sampling from the Gibbs distribution? ii)
If yes, do there also exist natural randomized dynamics that converges quickly
to the Gibbs distribution?
  We first study these questions in extension parallel congestion games, a
well-studied special case of symmetric network congestion games. As our main
result, we show that there is a simple variation on the logit dynamics (in
which we in addition are allowed to randomly interchange the strategies of two
players) that converges quickly to the Gibbs distribution in such games. This
answers both questions above affirmatively. We also address the first question
for the class of so-called capacitated $k$-uniform congestion games.
  To prove our results, we rely on the recent breakthrough work of Anari, Liu,
Oveis-Gharan and Vinzant (2019) concerning the approximate sampling of the base
of a matroid according to strongly log-concave probability distribution.

  The inclusion of the SDSS-DR16Q quasars was a complex task with emergent
issues which resulted in 13443 DR16Q entries being dropped, 1.79% of their
total. There are also 1701 quasars included from earlier visual SDSS releases,

available as atomically smooth, single-crystalline flakes, revolutionizing its
use in optoelectronics. For nanophotonics, these flakes offer strong
nonlinearities, hyperbolic dispersion, and single-photon emission, providing
unique properties for optical and quantum-optical applications. For
nanoelectronics, their pristine surfaces, chemical stability, and wide bandgap
have made them the key substrate, encapsulant, and gate dielectric for
two-dimensional electronic devices. However, while exploring these advantages,
researchers have been restricted to flat flakes or those patterned with basic
slits and holes, severely limiting advanced architectures. If freely varying
flake profiles were possible, the hBN structure would present a powerful design
parameter to further manipulate the flow of photons, electrons, and excitons in
next-generation devices. Here, we demonstrate freeform nanostructuring of hBN
by combining thermal scanning-probe lithography and reactive-ion etching to
shape flakes with surprising fidelity. We leverage sub-nanometer height control
and high spatial resolution to produce previously unattainable flake structures
for a broad range of optoelectronic applications. For photonics, we fabricate
microelements and show the straightforward transfer and integration of such
elements by placing a spherical hBN microlens between two planar mirrors to
obtain a stable, high-quality optical microcavity. We then decrease the
patterning length scale to introduce Fourier surfaces for electrons, creating
sophisticated, high-resolution landscapes in hBN, offering new possibilities
for strain and band-structure engineering. These capabilities can advance the
discovery and exploitation of emerging phenomena in hyperbolic metamaterials,
polaritonics, twistronics, quantum materials, and 2D optoelectronic devices.

acknowledgments of academic publications. According to the mainstream normative
account, the acknowledgments serve to repay debts towards formal or informal
collaborators. According to the strategic account, by contrast, the
acknowledgments serve to increase the perceived quality of papers by
associating the authors with influential scholars. The two accounts are
assessed by analyzing the acknowledgments indexed in Web of Science of 1218
articles published in the ""top-five journals"" of economics for the years
2015-2019. The analysis is focused on six dimensions: (i) the style of
acknowledging texts, (ii) the distribution of mentions, (iii) the identity of
the most mentioned acknowledgees, (iv) the shares of highly and lowly mentioned
acknowledgees, (v) the hierarchy of the acknowledgment network, and (vi) the
correlation at a paper level between intellectual similarity, measured by
common references, and social similarity, measured by common acknowledges.
Results show that the normative and the strategic account should be considered
as valid but partial explanations of acknowledging behavior. Hence,
acknowledgments should be used with extreme caution for investigating
collaboration practices and they should not be used to produce
acknowledgments-based metrics of scholars for evaluative purposes.

convolutional neural networks for object detection. Unlike convolutions which
are inherently parallel, the de-facto standard for NMS, namely GreedyNMS,
cannot be easily parallelized and thus could be the performance bottleneck in
convolutional object detection pipelines. MaxpoolNMS is introduced as a
parallelizable alternative to GreedyNMS, which in turn enables faster speed
than GreedyNMS at comparable accuracy. However, MaxpoolNMS is only capable of
replacing the GreedyNMS at the first stage of two-stage detectors like
Faster-RCNN. There is a significant drop in accuracy when applying MaxpoolNMS
at the final detection stage, due to the fact that MaxpoolNMS fails to
approximate GreedyNMS precisely in terms of bounding box selection. In this
paper, we propose a general, parallelizable and configurable approach
PSRR-MaxpoolNMS, to completely replace GreedyNMS at all stages in all
detectors. By introducing a simple Relationship Recovery module and a Pyramid
Shifted MaxpoolNMS module, our PSRR-MaxpoolNMS is able to approximate GreedyNMS
more precisely than MaxpoolNMS. Comprehensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms MaxpoolNMS by a large margin, and it is proven faster than
GreedyNMS with comparable accuracy. For the first time, PSRR-MaxpoolNMS
provides a fully parallelizable solution for customized hardware design, which
can be reused for accelerating NMS everywhere.

method in reinforcement learning (RL) as optimization problems using reverse
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and derives a new optimization method using
forward KL divergence, instead of reverse KL divergence in the optimization
problems. Although RL originally aims to maximize return indirectly through
optimization of policy, the recent work by Levine has proposed a different
derivation process with explicit consideration of optimality as stochastic
variable. This paper follows this concept and formulates the traditional
learning laws for both value function and policy as the optimization problems
with reverse KL divergence including optimality. Focusing on the asymmetry of
KL divergence, the new optimization problems with forward KL divergence are
derived. Remarkably, such new optimization problems can be regarded as
optimistic RL. That optimism is intuitively specified by a hyperparameter
converted from an uncertainty parameter. In addition, it can be enhanced when
it is integrated with prioritized experience replay and eligibility traces,
both of which accelerate learning. The effects of this expected optimism was
investigated through learning tendencies on numerical simulations using
Pybullet. As a result, moderate optimism accelerated learning and yielded
higher rewards. In a realistic robotic simulation, the proposed method with the
moderate optimism outperformed one of the state-of-the-art RL method.

singles, doubles and triples approximation (RCCSDT method) is an exact method
for these systems for a given set of basis functions, we notice large
differences in the results from this method when various procedures in the RCC
theory framework are adopted to estimate the IS constants. This has been
demonstrated by presenting the IS constants of the aforementioned states from
the finite-field, expectation value and analytical response (AR) approaches of
the RCCSDT method. Contributions from valence triple excitations, Breit
interaction and lower-order QED effects to the evaluation of these IS constants
are also highlighted. Our results are compared with high-precision calculations
reported using few-body methods wherever possible. We find that results from
the AR procedure are more reliable than the other two approaches. This analysis

on diverse paraphrasing: a conditional language model is first fine-tuned for
paraphrasing, and diversity is later introduced at the decoding stage at each

applied to unlabelled data, and then fueled to the Prototypical Network

foresees to employ wafer-scale sensors that can be bent to truly cylindrical
geometries after thinning them to thicknesses of 20-40$\mu$m. To solidify this
concept, the feasibility of operating bent MAPS was demonstrated using
1.5$\times$3cm ALPIDE chips. Already with their thickness of 50$\mu$m, they can
be successfully bent to radii of about 2cm without any signs of mechanical or
electrical damage. During a subsequent characterisation using a 5.4GeV electron
beam, it was further confirmed that they preserve their full electrical
functionality as well as particle detection performance.
  In this article, the bending procedure and the setup used for
characterisation are detailed. Furthermore, the analysis of the beam test,
including the measurement of the detection efficiency as a function of beam
position and local inclination angle, is discussed. The results show that the
sensors maintain their excellent performance after bending to radii of 2cm,
with detection efficiencies above 99.9% at typical operating conditions, paving
the way towards a new class of detectors with unprecedented low material budget
and ideal geometrical properties.

the matrix plays an important role in building statistically consistent
classifiers. Traditionally, the transition from clean labels to noisy labels
(i.e., clean-label transition matrix (CLTM)) has been widely exploited to learn
a clean label classifier by employing the noisy data. Motivated by that
classifiers mostly output Bayes optimal labels for prediction, in this paper,
we study to directly model the transition from Bayes optimal labels to noisy
labels (i.e., Bayes-label transition matrix (BLTM)) and learn a classifier to
predict Bayes optimal labels. Note that given only noisy data, it is ill-posed
to estimate either the CLTM or the BLTM. But favorably, Bayes optimal labels
have less uncertainty compared with the clean labels, i.e., the class
posteriors of Bayes optimal labels are one-hot vectors while those of clean
labels are not. This enables two advantages to estimate the BLTM, i.e., (a) a
set of examples with theoretically guaranteed Bayes optimal labels can be
collected out of noisy data; (b) the feasible solution space is much smaller.
By exploiting the advantages, we estimate the BLTM parametrically by employing
a deep neural network, leading to better generalization and superior
classification performance.

by introducing magnitude-propensity risk measures $(m_X,p_X)$. This bivariate
measure intends to account for the dual aspect of risk, where the magnitudes
$x$ of $X$ tell how hign are the losses incurred, whereas the probabilities
$P(X=x)$ reveal how often one has to expect to suffer such losses. The basic
idea is to simultaneously quantify both the severity $m_X$ and the propensity
$p_X$ of the real-valued risk $X$. This is to be contrasted with traditional
univariate risk measures, like VaR or Expected shortfall, which typically
conflate both effects. In its simplest form, $(m_X,p_X)$ is obtained by mass
transportation in Wasserstein metric of the law $P^X$ of $X$ to a two-points
$\{0, m_X\}$ discrete distribution with mass $p_X$ at $m_X$. The approach can
also be formulated as a constrained optimal quantization problem.
  This allows for an informative comparison of risks on both the magnitude and
propensity scales. Several examples illustrate the proposed approach.

It aims to estimate the mutual information between a pair of variables by
discriminating between each positive pair and its associated $K$ negative

mutual information estimation is tighter when more negative samples are
incorporated, which usually yields better model performance. However, in many
real-world tasks the labels often contain noise, and incorporating too many
noisy negative samples for model training may be suboptimal. In this paper, we
study how many negative samples are optimal for InfoNCE in different scenarios
via a semi-quantitative theoretical framework. More specifically, we first
propose a probabilistic model to analyze the influence of the negative sampling
ratio $K$ on training sample informativeness. Then, we design a training
effectiveness function to measure the overall influence of training samples on
model learning based on their informativeness. We estimate the optimal negative
sampling ratio using the $K$ value that maximizes the training effectiveness

improve InfoNCE based model training. Extensive experiments on different

important reduction in the number of iterations needed to reach a given
accuracy. However, RPP also made strong claims about the errors of their method
that are incorrect. In particular, they claim that their accuracy can always
reach the level $\sim5\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is the machine epsilon
(e.g. $\varepsilon=2.2\times10^{-16} $ in double precision), and that this
result is attained for all values of the eccentricity $e<1$ and the mean

analytically that any implementation of the classical or modified

Therefore the errors of these implementations diverge in the limit $e\to1$, and
differ dramatically from the incorrect results given by RPP. Despite these
shortcomings, the RPP method can provide a very efficient option for reaching
such limiting accuracy. We also provide a limit that is valid for the accuracy
of any algorithm for solving Kepler equation, including schemes like bisection
that do not use derivatives. Moreover, similar results are also demonstrated

the network may be pruned to increase sparsity in the network parameters. In
this paper, we explore the effects of sparsity promoting
$\ell_1$-regularization on training neural networks when only a small training

solution is to combine existing novel view synthesis and image/video style
transfer approaches, which often leads to blurry results or inconsistent
appearance. Inspired by the high-quality results of the neural radiance fields
(NeRF) method, we propose a joint framework to directly render novel views with
the desired style. Our framework consists of two components: an implicit
representation of the 3D scene with the neural radiance fields model, and a
hypernetwork to transfer the style information into the scene representation.
In particular, our implicit representation model disentangles the scene into
the geometry and appearance branches, and the hypernetwork learns to predict
the parameters of the appearance branch from the reference style image. To
alleviate the training difficulties and memory burden, we propose a two-stage
training procedure and a patch sub-sampling approach to optimize the style and
content losses with the neural radiance fields model. After optimization, our
model is able to render consistent novel views at arbitrary view angles with
arbitrary style. Both quantitative evaluation and human subject study have

algorithm, Optimal Design-based Linear Best Arm Identification (OD-LinBAI). We
provide a theoretical analysis of the failure probability of OD-LinBAI. Instead
of all the optimality gaps, the performance of OD-LinBAI depends only on the
gaps of the top $d$ arms, where $d$ is the effective dimension of the linear
bandit instance. Complementarily, we present a minimax lower bound for this
problem. The upper and lower bounds show that OD-LinBAI is minimax optimal up
to constant multiplicative factors in the exponent, which is a significant
theoretical improvement over existing methods (e.g., BayesGap, Peace,
LinearExploration and GSE), and settles the question of ascertaining the
difficulty of learning the best arm in the fixed-budget setting. Finally,
numerical experiments demonstrate considerable empirical improvements over
existing algorithms on a variety of real and synthetic datasets.

variant which introduces symmetry breaking in the vector meson sector; the
central mechanism is a modification of the covariant derivative at the root of
the HLS approach. However, the description of the Belle $\tau$ dipion spectra
is not satisfactory whereas the dealing with its annihilation sector ($e^+ e^-
\rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^-/\pi^+ \pi^-\pi^0/ \pi^0 \gamma/\eta \gamma/K^+ K^-/K_L
K_S$) is optimum. This issue is solved by an additional breaking term allowing
to include the $[\pi^0,\eta,\eta^\prime]$ system. This extension of the usual
't~Hooft determinant term only affects the BHLS$_2$ kinetic energy term. One
obtains a fair account for the $\tau$ dipion spectra as well as for the
annihilation channels.
  The Belle dipion spectrum provides evidence for a violation of CVC in the
$\tau$ lepton decay; this evidence is strengthened by imposing the conditions
$<0|J_\mu^q |[q^\prime \overline{q^\prime}](p)>=ip_\mu f_q \delta_{q q^\prime

  \{ [q \overline{q}], q=u,d,s\}$ on BHLS$_2$ axial current matrix elements.
BHLS$_2$ is found to recover the usual (completed) formulae for the
[$\pi^0,~\eta,~\eta^\prime$] mixing parameters and the global fits return
mixing parameter values in agreement with expectations and better
uncertainties. Updating the muon HVP, one argues that the strong tension
between the KLOE and BaBar pion form factors imposes to provide two solutions :
$a_\mu^{HVP-LO}({\rm KLOE})=687.31 \pm 2.93$ and $a_\mu^{HVP-LO}({\rm

of these. Taking into account common systematics, their differences with the

over the past few years. Worryingly, the QAnon conspiracy theory has
implications in the real world, with supporters of the theory participating in
real-world violent acts like the US capitol attack in 2021. At the same time,
the QAnon theory started evolving into a global phenomenon by attracting
followers across the globe and, in particular, in Europe. Therefore, it is
imperative to understand how the QAnon theory became a worldwide phenomenon and
how this dissemination has been happening in the online space. This paper
performs a large-scale data analysis of QAnon through Telegram by collecting
4.5M messages posted in 161 QAnon groups/channels. Using Google's Perspective
API, we analyze the toxicity of QAnon content across languages and over time.
Also, using a BERT-based topic modeling approach, we analyze the QAnon
discourse across multiple languages. Among other things, we find that the
German language is prevalent in QAnon groups/channels on Telegram, even
overshadowing English after 2020. Also, we find that content posted in German
and Portuguese tends to be more toxic compared to English. Our topic modeling
indicates that QAnon supporters discuss various topics of interest within
far-right movements, including world politics, conspiracy theories, COVID-19,
and the anti-vaccination movement. Taken all together, we perform the first
multilingual study on QAnon through Telegram and paint a nuanced overview of
the globalization of the QAnon theory.

This anomaly probably originates from a transition from a uniform

field-angular dependence due to a quasi-isotropic paramagnetic effect in

smeared out and low-temperature upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ changes
significantly if fields are not parallel to the conducting plane even for a

identified the indicators that quantify email communication into measurable
dimensions. To empirically examine the predictive power of the proposed

interpretable association between email indicators and top performance. The
results suggest that top performers tend to assume central network positions

more positive and complex language, with low emotionality, but rich in
influential words that are probably reused by co-workers. To better explore the

between 9 and 29$M_{\odot}$, all evolved with KEPLER at solar metallicity and
ignoring rotation. The [OI]$\lambda\lambda$$6300,6364$ line flux generally
grows with progenitor mass, and H$\alpha$ exhibits an equally strong and
opposite trend. The [CaII]$\lambda\lambda$$7291,\,7323$ strength increases at
low $^{56}$Ni mass, low explosion energy, or with clumping. This CaII doublet,
which forms primarily in the explosively-produced Si/S zones, depends little on
the progenitor mass, but may strengthen if Ca$^+$ dominates in the H-rich
emitting zones or if Ca is abundant in the O-rich zones. Indeed, Si-O shell
merging prior to core collapse may boost the CaII doublet at the expense of the
OI doublet, and may thus mimic the metal line strengths of a lower mass
progenitor. We find that the $^{56}$Ni bubble effect has a weak impact,
probably because it is too weak to induce much of an ionization shift in the
various emitting zones. Our simulations compare favorably to observed SNe II,
including SN2008bk (e.g., 9$M_{\odot}$ model), SN2012aw (12$M_{\odot}$ model),
SN1987A (15$M_{\odot}$ model), or SN2015bs (25$M_{\odot}$ model with no Si-O

matched by the weak explosion of 9$-$11$M_{\odot}$ progenitors. The
nebular-phase spectra of standard SNe II can be explained with progenitors in
the mass range 12$-$15$M_{\odot}$, with one notable exception for SN2015bs. In
the intermediate mass range, these mass estimates may increase by a few

desired state trajectory and the weighting gains of the quadratic cost function
optimized by a constrained predictive controller. The vision system is defined
as a deep neural network designed to estimate the dynamics of the images scene.
The input is based on historic sequences of sensory observations and vehicle
states, integrated by an Augmented Memory component. Deep Q-Learning is used to
train the deep network, which once trained can be used to also calculate the
desired trajectory of the vehicle. We evaluate LVD-NMPC against a baseline
Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) path planning executed using standard NMPC, as

  Convergence with Limited Visibility",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Among fundamental problems in the context of distributed computing by
autonomous mobile entities, one of the most representative and well studied is
{\sc Point Convergence}: given an arbitrary initial configuration of identical
entities, disposed in the Euclidean plane, move in such a way that, for all
$\eps>0$, a configuration in which the separation between all entities is at
most $\eps$ is eventually reached and maintained.
  The problem has been previously studied in a variety of settings, including
full visibility, exact measurements (like distances and angles), and
synchronous activation of entities. Our study concerns the minimal assumptions
under which entities, moving asynchronously with limited and unknown visibility
range and subject to limited imprecision in measurements, can be guaranteed to
converge in this way.
  We present an algorithm that solves {\sc Point Convergence}, for entities in
the plane, in such a setting, provided the degree of asynchrony is bounded:
while any one entity is active, any other entity can be activated at most $k$
times, for some arbitrarily large but fixed $k$. This provides a strong
positive answer to a decade old open question posed by Katreniak.
  We also prove that in a comparable setting that permits unbounded asynchrony,
{\sc Point Convergence} in the plane is impossible, contingent on the natural
assumption that algorithms maintain the (visible) connectivity among entities
present in the initial configuration. This variant, that we call {\sc Cohesive
Convergence}, serves to distinguish the power of bounded and unbounded
asynchrony in the control of autonomous mobile entities, settling at the same
time a long-standing question whether in the Euclidean plane synchronously
scheduled entities are more powerful than asynchronously scheduled entities.

conductance in a graphene based QH-SC junction at integer filling nu=2.
Remarkably, we find that the Fano factor of shot noise approaches half when the
bias energy is less than the superconducting gap, whereas it is close to zero
above the superconducting gap. This is striking, given that, at the same time,
the electrical conductance remains quantized at 2e^2/h within and above the

noise due to its dissipationless flow. However, at a QH-SC interface, AESs
carry the current in the zero-bias limit and an equal mixing of electron and

conductance. The observed results are in accord with our detailed theoretical

exited knowledge in the KGs. The path-based knowledge reasoning algorithm is
one of the most important approaches to this task. This type of method has
received great attention in recent years because of its high performance and
interpretability. In fact, traditional methods such as path ranking algorithm
(PRA) take the paths between an entity pair as atomic features. However, the
medical KGs are very sparse, which makes it difficult to model effective
semantic representation for extremely sparse path features. The sparsity in the
medical KGs is mainly reflected in the long-tailed distribution of entities and
paths. Previous methods merely consider the context structure in the paths of
the knowledge graph and ignore the textual semantics of the symbols in the
path. Therefore, their performance cannot be further improved due to the two
aspects of entity sparseness and path sparseness. To address the above issues,
this paper proposes two novel path-based reasoning methods to solve the
sparsity issues of entity and path respectively, which adopts the textual
semantic information of entities and paths for MedKGC. By using the pre-trained
model BERT, combining the textual semantic representations of the entities and
the relationships, we model the task of symbolic reasoning in the medical KG as
a numerical computing issue in textual semantic representation.

$w$, there is a minimal $v$ such that $\sigma(u,v,w)\neq 0$. Denoting this $v$
as $v_\hbox{min}=v_\hbox{min}(u,w)$, we will prove that
$\sigma(u,v_\hbox{min},w)$ is a polynomial of the cardinality $q$ of the
residue field. Indeed if $v>v_\hbox{min}$, then $\sigma(u,v,w)$ is a rational
function of $\mathbf{z}$ and $q$, whose denominator we describe. But if
$v=v_\hbox{min}$, the dependence on $\mathbf{z}$ disappears. We will express
$\sigma(u,v_\hbox{min},w)$ as the Poincar\'e polynomial of a Bruhat interval.
The proof leads to fairly intricate considerations of the Bruhat order.
  Thus our results require us to prove some facts that may be of independent
interest, relating the Bruhat order $\leqslant$ and the weak Bruhat order
$\leqslant_R$. For example we will prove (for finite Coxeter groups) the
following ""mixed meet"" property. If $u, w$ are elements of $W$, then there
exists a unique element $m \in W$ that is maximal with respect to the condition
that $m \leqslant_R u$ and $m \leqslant w$. Thus if $z \leqslant_R u$ and $z
\leqslant w$, then $x \leqslant m$. The value $v_\hbox{min}$ is $m^{-1}u$.

consistency cuts, to be applied to a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation (or

integer solution to the corresponding Dantzig-Wolfe relaxation when certain
criteria to the structure of the decomposition are met. We implement the cuts
and use them to solve a commonly used test set of 200 instances of the temporal
knapsack problem. We assess the performance with and without the cuts and
compare further to CPLEX and other solution methods that have historically been
used to solve the test set. By separating consistency cuts we show that we can
obtain optimal integer solutions much faster than the other methods and even
solve the remaining unsolved problems in the test set. We also perform a second
test on instances from the MIPLIB 2017 online library of mixed-integer
programs, showing the potential of the cuts on a wider range of problems.

resolve low-resolution images. Single-Image SR generally handles each image
independently, but ignores the temporal information implied in continuing
frames. Multi-frame SR is able to model the temporal dependency via capturing
motion information. However, it relies on neighbouring frames which are not
always available in the real world. Meanwhile, slight camera shake easily
causes heavy motion blur on long-distance-shot low-resolution images. To
address these problems, a Blind Motion Deblurring Super-Reslution Networks,
BMDSRNet, is proposed to learn dynamic spatio-temporal information from single
static motion-blurred images. Motion-blurred images are the accumulation over
time during the exposure of cameras, while the proposed BMDSRNet learns the
reverse process and uses three-streams to learn Bidirectional spatio-temporal
information based on well designed reconstruction loss functions to recover
clean high-resolution images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed BMDSRNet outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, and has the
ability to simultaneously deal with image deblurring and SR.

options, and are expected to alleviate congestion by sharing empty car seats.
An efficient matching algorithm is essential to the success of a ride-sharing
system. The matching problem is related to the well-known dial-a-ride problem,
which also tries to find the optimal pickup and delivery sequence for a given
set of passengers. In this paper, we propose an efficient dynamic tree
algorithm to solve the on-demand peer-to-peer ride-sharing matching problem.
The dynamic tree algorithm benefits from given ride-sharing driver schedules,
and provides satisfactory runtime performances. In addition, an efficient
pre-processing procedure to select candidate passenger requests is proposed,
which further improves the algorithm performance. Numerical experiments
conducted in a small network show that the dynamic tree algorithm reaches the
same objective function values of the exact algorithm, but with shorter
runtimes. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to a larger size problem.
Results show that the spatial distribution of ride-sharing participants
influences the algorithm performance. Sensitivity analysis confirms that the
most critical ride-sharing matching constraints are the excess travel times.
The network analysis suggests that small vehicle capacities do not guarantee
overall vehicle-kilometer travel savings.

signal can introduce unpleasant sounding artifacts known as musical noise.
These artifacts are observed in the context of audio coding, speech
enhancement, and source separation. The change in kurtosis of the power
spectrum introduced during the processing was shown to correlate with the human
perception of musical noise in the context of speech enhancement, leading to
the proposal of measures based on it. These baseline measures are here shown to
correlate with human perception only in a limited manner. As ground truth for
the human perception, the results from two listening tests are considered: one
involving audio coding and one involving source separation. Simple but
effective perceptually motivated improvements are proposed and the resulting
new measure is shown to clearly outperform the baselines in terms of
correlation with the results of both listening tests. Moreover, with respect to
the listening test on musical noise in audio coding, the exhibited correlation
is nearly as good as the one exhibited by the Artifact-related Perceptual Score
(APS), which was found to be the best objective measure for this task. The APS
is however computationally very expensive. The proposed measure is easily
computed, requiring only a fraction of the computational cost of the APS.

this at hand, we propose a composite likelihood (CL) based inference for our

models in the literature that involve computationally heavy algorithms for

to the latent process, we propose a CL Expectation-Maximization algorithm and
discuss a bootstrap approach to obtain standard errors. The finite-sample
performance of our composite likelihood methods is assessed through Monte Carlo

well as a variant, which we call local matching, that restricts each syndrome
defect to be matched to another defect within a local neighbourhood. The
decoding performance of local matching is almost identical to that of the
standard MWPM decoder in practice, while reducing the computational complexity
approximately quadratically. We benchmark the performance of PyMatching,
showing that local matching is several orders of magnitude faster than
implementations of the full MWPM algorithm using NetworkX or Blossom V for
problem sizes typically considered in error correction simulations. PyMatching
and its dependencies are open-source, and it can be used to decode any quantum
code for which syndrome defects come in pairs using a simple Python interface.
PyMatching supports the use of weighted edges, hook errors, boundaries and
measurement errors, enabling fast decoding and simulation of fault-tolerant

luminance in real-world scenes due to sensor constraints. Besides, noise and
quantization errors are often introduced in the imaging process. In order to
obtain high dynamic range (HDR) images with excellent visual quality, the most
common solution is to combine multiple images with different exposures.
However, it is not always feasible to obtain multiple images of the same scene
and most HDR reconstruction methods ignore the noise and quantization loss. In
this work, we propose a novel learning-based approach using a spatially dynamic
encoder-decoder network, HDRUNet, to learn an end-to-end mapping for single
image HDR reconstruction with denoising and dequantization. The network
consists of a UNet-style base network to make full use of the hierarchical
multi-scale information, a condition network to perform pattern-specific
modulation and a weighting network for selectively retaining information.
Moreover, we propose a Tanh_L1 loss function to balance the impact of
over-exposed values and well-exposed values on the network learning. Our method
achieves the state-of-the-art performance in quantitative comparisons and
visual quality. The proposed HDRUNet model won the second place in the single
frame track of NITRE2021 High Dynamic Range Challenge.

gravitational-wave interferometers using data from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's
third observing run. To perform this analysis, we use two methods, one based on
cross-correlation of the strain channels in the two nearly aligned LIGO
detectors, and one that looks for excess power in the strain channels of the
LIGO and Virgo detectors. The excess power method optimizes the Fourier
Transform coherence time as a function of frequency, to account for the
expected signal width due to Doppler modulations. We do not find any evidence
of dark photon dark matter with a mass between $m_{\rm A} \sim
10^{-14}-10^{-11}$ eV/$c^2$, which corresponds to frequencies between 10-2000
Hz, and therefore provide upper limits on the square of the minimum coupling of
dark photons to baryons, i.e. $U(1)_{\rm B}$ dark matter. For the
cross-correlation method, the best median constraint on the squared coupling is
$\sim1.31\times10^{-47}$ at $m_{\rm A}\sim4.2\times10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$; for the
other analysis, the best constraint is $\sim 2.4\times 10^{-47}$ at $m_{\rm
A}\sim 5.7\times 10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$. These limits improve upon those obtained
in direct dark matter detection experiments by a factor of $\sim100$ for
$m_{\rm A}\sim [2-4]\times 10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$, and are, in absolute terms, the
most stringent constraint so far in a large mass range $m_A\sim$ $2\times
10^{-13}-8\times 10^{-12}$ eV/$c^2$.

  Controllable Speech Synthesis","Accepted to TASLP 2021",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generating natural speech with a diverse and smooth prosody pattern is a
challenging task. Although random sampling with phone-level prosody
distribution has been investigated to generate different prosody patterns, the
diversity of the generated speech is still very limited and far from what can
be achieved by humans. This is largely due to the use of uni-modal
distribution, such as single Gaussian, in the prior works of phone-level
prosody modelling. In this work, we propose a novel approach that models
phone-level prosodies with a GMM-based mixture density network(MDN) and then
extend it for multi-speaker TTS using speaker adaptation transforms of Gaussian
means and variances. Furthermore, we show that we can clone the prosodies from
a reference speech by sampling prosodies from the Gaussian components that
produce the reference prosodies. Our experiments on LJSpeech and LibriTTS
dataset show that the proposed method with GMM-based MDN not only achieves
significantly better diversity than using a single Gaussian in both
single-speaker and multi-speaker TTS, but also provides better naturalness. The
prosody cloning experiments demonstrate that the prosody similarity of the
proposed method with GMM-based MDN is comparable to recent proposed
fine-grained VAE while the target speaker similarity is better.

wireless communication systems. The combination of large-scale antennas with
high transmission frequencies often results in the communicating devices
operating in the near-field (Fresnel) region. In this paper, we study the
potential of beam focusing, feasible in near-field operation, in facilitating
high-rate multi-user downlink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. As
the ability to achieve beam focusing is dictated by the transmit antenna, we
study near-field signaling considering different antenna structures, including
fully-digital architectures, hybrid phase shifter-based precoders, and the
emerging dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) architecture for massive MIMO
arrays. We first provide a mathematical model to characterize near-field
wireless channels as well as the transmission pattern for the considered
antenna architectures. Then, we formulate the beam focusing problem for the
goal of maximizing the achievable sum-rate in multi-user networks. We propose
efficient solutions based on the sum-rate maximization task for fully-digital,
(phase shifters based-) hybrid and DMA architectures. Simulation results show
the feasibility of the proposed beam focusing scheme for both single- and
multi-user scenarios. In particular, the designed focused beams are such that
users residing at the same angular direction can communicate reliably without
interfering with each other, which is not achievable using conventional
far-field beam steering.

frequency combs through strong radio-frequency current modulation close to
their repetition frequency is demonstrated. In particular, broadening of the
spectrum from about 20 cm$^{-1}$ to 60cm$^{-1}$ can be achieved throughout most
of the current dynamical range while preserving the coherence, as measured by
shifted wave interference Fourier transform spectroscopy (SWIFTS). The required
modulation frequency to achieve this broadening is red-shifted compared to the
free-running beatnote frequency at increasing modulation powers starting from
25 dBm, whereas the range where it occurs narrows. Outside of this
maximum-bandwidth range, the spectral bandwidth of the laser output is
gradually reduced and the new center frequency is red- or blue-shifted,
directly dependent on the detuning of the modulation frequency. By switching
between two modulation frequencies detuned symmetrically with respect to the
free-running beatnote, we can generate two multiplexed spectral regions with
negligible overlap from the same device at rates of at least 20 kHz. In the
time-domain we show with both SWIFTS and interferometric autocorrelation (IAC)
measurements a transition from quasi-continuous output to pulsed ($\tau_p
\approx 55$ ps) output by ramping up the injection power to 35 dBm.

chemistry and materials, usually require a large number of measurements of the
Hamiltonian. Exploiting different ideas, such as {importance sampling,}
observable compatibility, or classical shadows of quantum states, different
advanced measurement schemes have been proposed to greatly reduce the large
measurement cost. Yet, the underline cost reduction mechanisms seem distinct
from each other, and how to systematically find the optimal scheme remains a
critical challenge. Here, we address this challenge by proposing a unified
framework of quantum measurements, incorporating advanced measurement methods
as special cases. Our framework allows us to introduce a general scheme~ --
~overlapped grouping measurement, which simultaneously exploits the advantages
of most existing methods. An intuitive understanding of the scheme is to
partition the measurements into overlapped groups with each one consisting of
compatible measurements. We provide explicit grouping strategies and
numerically verify its performance for different molecular Hamiltonians with up
to 16 qubits. Our numerical result shows significant improvements over existing
schemes. Our work paves the way for efficient quantum measurement and fast
quantum processing with current and near-term quantum devices.

satisfactory theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. In this work, we
provide the first insights into the working mechanisms of distillation by
studying the special case of linear and deep linear classifiers. Specifically,
we prove a generalization bound that establishes fast convergence of the
expected risk of a distillation-trained linear classifier. From the bound and
its proof we extract three key factors that determine the success of
distillation: * data geometry -- geometric properties of the data distribution,
in particular class separation, has a direct influence on the convergence speed
of the risk; * optimization bias -- gradient descent optimization finds a very
favorable minimum of the distillation objective; and * strong monotonicity --
the expected risk of the student classifier always decreases when the size of
the training set grows.

They possess certain similarities, but several important differences, which
means that the relationship between them is quite subtle and sometimes obscure.
In this article, a new perspective based on duality is proposed to create new
insights. It successfully unifies the grid interfacing and synchronization
characteristics of the two inverter types in a symmetric, elegant, and
technology-neutral form. Analysis shows that the grid-forming and
grid-following inverters are duals of each other in several ways including a)
synchronization controllers: frequency droop control and phase-locked loop
(PLL); b) grid-interfacing characteristics: current-following voltage-forming
and voltage-following current-forming; c) swing characteristics: current-angle
swing and voltage-angle swing; d) inner-loop controllers: output impedance
shaping and output admittance shaping; and e) grid strength compatibility:
strong-grid instability and weak-grid instability. The swing equations are also
derived in dual form, which reveal the dynamic interaction between the grid
strength, the synchronization controllers, and the inner-loop controllers.
Insights are generated into cases of poor stability in both small-signal and
transient/large-signal. The theoretical analysis and simulation results are
used to illustrate cases for simple single-inverter-infinite-bus systems and a

  Problems",,,,,"cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Population-based methods are often used to solve multimodal optimization
problems. By combining niching or clustering strategy, the state-of-the-art
approaches generally divide the population into several subpopulations to find
multiple solutions for a problem at hand. However, these methods only guided by
the fitness value during iterations, which are suffering from determining the
number of subpopulations, i.e., the number of niche areas or clusters. To
compensate for this drawback, this paper presents an Attention-oriented Brain
Storm Optimization (ABSO) method that introduces the attention mechanism into a
relatively new swarm intelligence algorithm, i.e., Brain Storm Optimization
(BSO). By converting the objective space from the fitness space into
""attention"" space, the individuals are clustered and updated iteratively
according to their salient values. Rather than converge to a single global
optimum, the proposed method can guide the search procedure to converge to
multiple ""salient"" solutions. The preliminary results show that the proposed
method can locate multiple global and local optimal solutions of several
multimodal benchmark functions. The proposed method needs less prior knowledge
of the problem and can automatically converge to multiple optimums guided by
the attention mechanism, which has excellent potential for further development.

to move the data point to only the boundary of the Voronoi region of the

velocities. However, the controller's parameters need to be optimized to adapt
to situations changing, such as the different swarm population, the changing of
the target to be followed, and the anti-collision demands, etc. In this letter,
we apply a modified Brain Storm Optimization (BSO) algorithm to an incremental
PID tracking controller to get the relatively optimal parameters adaptively for
leader-follower formation control for swarm robotics. Simulation results show
that the proposed method could reach the optimal parameters during robot
movements. The flexibility and scalability are also validated, which ensures
that the proposed method can adapt to different situations and be a good
candidate for coordinated motion control for swarm robotics in more realistic
scenarios.

nonlinear. However, that does not necessarily mean only that the measurements

determining whether and to what degree the measured time series exhibits
nonlinear changes over time. The mathematical steps include multifractal

entails nonlinear changes over time. Ultimately, when measurements fail to fit
the structures of the traditional linear model, multifractal modeling gives us
the means to make those nonlinear excursions explicit and perhaps permit the
development of theory that draws on both linear and nonlinear processes.

  We describe IA-CCF, a new permissioned ledger system that provides individual
accountability. It can assign blame to the individual members that operate
misbehaving replicas regardless of the number of misbehaving replicas or

the ledger, and by using Merkle trees to provide clients with succinct,
universally-verifiable receipts as evidence of successful transaction
execution. Anyone can audit the ledger against a set of receipts to discover
inconsistencies and identify replicas that signed contradictory statements.
IA-CCF also supports changes to consortium membership and replicas by tracking
signing keys using a sub-ledger of governance transactions. IA-CCF provides
strong disincentives to misbehavior with low overhead: it executes 47,000 tx/s

spare normal tissues from radiotoxicity, while efficiently controlling the
tumor, and this is known as the FLASH effect. This study performed theoretical
analyses about the impact of radiolytic oxygen depletion (ROD) on the cellular
responses after FLASH irradiation. Methods: Monte Carlo simulation was used to
model the ROD process, determine the DNA damage, and calculate the amount of
oxygen depleted (LROD) during FLASH exposure. A mathematical model was applied
to analyze oxygen tension (pO2) distribution in human tissues and the recovery
of pO2 after FLASH irradiation. DNA damage and cell survival fractions (SFs)
after FLASH irradiation were calculated. The impact of initial cellular pO2,
FLASH pulse number, pulse interval, and radiation quality of the source
particles on ROD and subsequent cellular responses were systematically
evaluated. Results: The simulated electron LROD range was 0.38-0.43 {\mu}M/Gy
when pO2 ranged from 7.5-160 mmHg. The calculated DNA damage and SFs show that
radioprotective effect is only evident in cells with a lower pO2. Different
irradiation setups alter the cellular responses by modifying the pO2. Single
pulse delivery or multi-pulse delivery with pulse intervals shorter than 10-50
ms resulted in fewer DNA damages and higher SFs. Source particles with a low
radiation quality have a higher capacity to deplete oxygen, and thus, lead to a
more conspicuous radioprotective effect. Conclusions: The FLASH radioprotective
effect due to ROD may only be observed in cells with a low pO2. Single pulse
delivery or multi-pulse delivery with short pulse intervals are suggested for
FLASH irradiation to avoid oxygen tension recovery during pulse intervals.
Source particles with low radiation quality are preferred for their conspicuous
radioprotective effects.

performed along a special SDRG trajectory of the random XX chain, we identify a
series of integer powers of $1/l$ in the singlet-length distribution with the
subleading term $\frac{4}{3}l^{-3}$. Our numerical SDRG analysis shows that,
for the XX fixed point, the subleading term is generally $O(l^{-3})$ with a
non-universal coefficient and also reveals terms with half-integer powers:
$l^{-7/2}$ and $l^{-5/2}$ for the XX and XXX fixed points, respectively. We
also present how the singlet lengths originating in the SDRG approach can be
interpreted and calculated in the XX chain from the one-particle states of the
equivalent free-fermion model. These results imply that the subleading term
next to the logarithmic one in the entanglement entropy is $O(\ell^{-1})$ for
the XX fixed point and $O(\ell^{-1/2})$ for the XXX fixed point with
non-universal coefficients. For the XX model, where a comparison with exact
diagonalization is possible, the order of the subleading term is confirmed but

of \thisgrb, an optical bright GRB with an observed reverse shock (RS)
signature. Observations of this GRB were acquired with the BOOTES-4 robotic
telescope, the \fermi, and the \swift missions. Time-resolved spectroscopy of
the prompt emission shows that changes to the peak energy (\Ep) tracks
intensity and the low-energy spectral index seems to follow the intensity for
the first episode, whereas this tracking behavior is less clear during the
second episode. The fit to the afterglow light curves shows that the early
optical afterglow can be described with RS emission and is consistent with the
thin shell scenario of the constant ambient medium. The late time afterglow
decay is also consistent with the prediction of the external forward shock (FS)
model. We determine the properties of the shocks, Lorentz factor, magnetization
parameters, and ambient density of \thisgrb, and compare these parameters with
another 12 GRBs, consistent with having RS produced by thin shells in an
ISM-like medium. The value of the magnetization parameter ($R_{\rm B} \approx
18$) indicates a moderately magnetized baryonic dominant jet composition for
\thisgrb. We also report the host galaxy photometric observations of \thisgrb
obtained with 10.4m GTC, 3.5m CAHA, and 3.6m DOT telescopes and find the host
(photo $z$ = $2.8^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$) to be a high mass, star-forming galaxy with a
star formation rate of $20 \pm 10 \msun$ $\rm yr^{-1}$.

the network stack. Starting from the bottom up, the present work describes an
endeavor at uncloaking the origins of physical layer (PHY) latency in mmWave
Wi-Fi networks. It proposes a newly designed simulation framework and sheds
light on how any conventional laboratory can be turned into a virtual

popular to reduce bias in high-dimensional bioinformatic and clinical studies
(e.g. real-world data, target trials, -omic discovery). Their relative
statistical efficiency (high power) is particularly invaluable in these
contexts since sample sizes are often limited due to practical and cost
concerns. However, these methods are subject to technical limitations that are
dataset specific and involve computational trade-offs. Thus, it is challenging
for analysts to identify when such methods may offer benefits or select amongst
statistical methods. We present extensive simulation studies of several
cutting-edge estimators, evaluating both performance and computation time.
Critically, rather than use arbitrary simulation data, we generate synthetic
datasets mimicking the observed data structure (plasmode simulation) of a real
molecular epidemiologic cohort. We find that machine learning approaches may
not always be indicated in such data settings, but that performance is highly
context dependent. We present a user-friendly Shiny app REFINE2 (Realistic
Evaluations of Finite sample INference using Efficient Estimators) that enables
analysts to simulate synthetic data from their own datasets and directly
evaluate the performance of several cutting-edge algorithms in those settings.
This tool may greatly facilitate the proper selection and implementation of

landmark detection. However, few prior works have thoroughly discussed about
models for practical applications. Instead, they often focus on improving a
couple of issues at a time while ignoring the others. To bridge this gap, we
aim to explore a practical model that is accurate, robust, efficient,
generalizable, and end-to-end trainable at the same time. To this end, we first
propose a baseline model equipped with one transformer decoder as detection
head. In order to achieve a better accuracy, we further propose two lightweight
modules, namely dynamic query initialization (DQInit) and query-aware memory
(QAMem). Specifically, DQInit dynamically initializes the queries of decoder
from the inputs, enabling the model to achieve as good accuracy as the ones
with multiple decoder layers. QAMem is designed to enhance the discriminative
ability of queries on low-resolution feature maps by assigning separate memory
values to each query rather than a shared one. With the help of QAMem, our
model removes the dependence on high-resolution feature maps and is still able
to obtain superior accuracy. Extensive experiments and analysis on three
popular benchmarks show the effectiveness and practical advantages of the
proposed model. Notably, our model achieves new state of the art on WFLW as
well as competitive results on 300W and COFW, while still running at 50+ FPS.

tomography (CT) images is an important first-line task for presymptomatic
cardiovascular disease diagnosis. In several recent studies, deep learning
models have shown significant breakthroughs in medical image segmentation
tasks. Unlike other organs such as the lungs and liver, the cardiac organ
consists of multiple substructures, i.e., ventricles, atriums, aortas,
arteries, veins, and myocardium. These cardiac substructures are proximate to
each other and have indiscernible boundaries (i.e., homogeneous intensity
values), making it difficult for the segmentation network focus on the
boundaries between the substructures. In this paper, to improve the
segmentation accuracy between proximate organs, we introduce a novel model to
exploit shape and boundary-aware features. We primarily propose a shape-aware
attention module, that exploits distance regression, which can guide the model
to focus on the edges between substructures so that it can outperform the
conventional contour-based attention method. In the experiments, we used the
Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation dataset that has 20 CT cardiac images
for training and validation, and 40 CT cardiac images for testing. The
experimental results show that the proposed network produces more accurate
results than state-of-the-art networks by improving the Dice similarity
coefficient score by 4.97%. Our proposed shape-aware contour attention
mechanism demonstrates that distance transformation and boundary features
improve the actual attention map to strengthen the responses in the boundary
area. Moreover, our proposed method significantly reduces the false-positive
responses of the final output, resulting in accurate segmentation.

  Topics in 6G Communications, Jun. 14th, 2021",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate the fundamental problem of wireless link
scheduling in device-to-device (D2D) networks, through the lens of Riemannian
geometry. Our goal is to find a novel metric to characterize interference among
D2D pairs, which can pave the way towards efficient and fast scheduling
algorithms. Towards achieving this goal, we first model the connectivity
pattern of each D2D pair, including its interference links, as a
positively-shifted Laplacian matrix, which is a symmetric positive definite
(SPD) one. Noting that SPD matrices constitute a non-Euclidean manifold, we
represent each of the D2D pairs as a point on the SPD (i.e., conic) manifold,
which is analyzed via Riemannian geometry. Accordingly we employ Riemannian
metrics (e.g., Log-Euclidean metric ""LEM""), which are suitable measures of
distances on manifolds, to characterize the interference among D2D points on
the SPD manifold.
  To validate the effectiveness of the proposed LEM-based interference measure,
we propose a sequential link selection algorithm that schedules D2D pairs in a
descending order of their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while keeping their LEM
distances towards the already-scheduled pairs on the Riemannian manifold to be
greater than a certain LEM threshold. Such LEM-based condition is equivalent to
limiting the interference from potential D2D pairs to be below certain
threshold. We show that the proposed LEM-based scheduling algorithm achieves
sum rate of more than 86% of state-of-the-art ones (e.g., FPLinQ), while only
requiring spatial locations of D2D pairs, as opposed to requiring full channel
state information (CSI).

This is particularly true in the context of detecting relevant non-contractible

constructs are favored in algorithmic solutions. In this work, we devise a
variational analogy to the loop shrinking property and show that it yields a
simple, intuitive, yet powerful solution allowing a streamlined treatment of
the problem of handle and tunnel loop detection. Our formalization tracks the
evolution of a diffusion front randomly initiated on a single location on the
surface. Capitalizing on a diffuse interface representation combined with a set
of rules for concurrent front interactions, we develop a dynamic data structure
for tracking the evolution on the surface encoded as a sparse matrix which
serves for performing both diffusion numerics and loop detection and acts as
the workhorse of our fully parallel implementation. The substantiated results
suggest our approach outperforms state of the art and robustly copes with
highly detailed geometric models. As a byproduct, our approach can be used to
construct Reeb graphs by diffusion thus avoiding commonly encountered issues
when using Morse functions.

of the Jagellonian University in Cracow. The different frequency radiation
originates from different heights in the solar corona. Existing models,
indicate its origin at the height range from nearly $\sim12,000$ km (for
emission at 275 MHz), below up to $\sim2,400$ km (for emission at 1755 MHz).
There are some data gaps in the time series used for the study, so we used
statistical analysis using the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP). This method has
successfully estimated the periodicity present in time series even with such
data gaps. The rotation period estimated through LSP shows variation in
rotation period, which is compared with the earlier reported estimate using
auto correlation technique. The present study indicates some similarity as well

data on cometary dust in the Red (0.62--0.73 $\mu$m) and K (2.00--2.39 $\mu$m)
domains to leverage the relative excess of the polarisation degree of a comet
to the average trend at the given phase angle ($P_{\rm excess}$) as a metric of
the dust's scattered light characteristics. The flux excess of silicate
emissions to the continuum around 10 $\mu$m ($F_{\rm Si}/F_{\rm cont}$) is
adopted from previous studies as a metric of the dust's MIR feature. The two
metrics show a positive correlation when $P_{\rm excess}$ is measured in the K
domain. No significant correlation was identified in the Red domain. The
gas-rich comets have systematically weaker $F_{\rm Si}/F_{\rm cont}$ than the
dust-rich ones, yet both groups retain the same overall tendency with different
slope values. The observed positive correlation between the two metrics
indicates that composition is a peripheral factor in characterising the dust's
polarimetric and silicate emission properties. The systematic difference in
$F_{\rm Si}/F_{\rm cont}$ for gas-rich versus dust-rich comets would rather
correspond with the difference in their dust size distribution. Hence, our
results suggest that the current MIR spectral models of cometary dust should
prioritise the dust size and porosity over the composition. With light
scattering being sensitive to different size scales in two wavebands, we expect
the K-domain polarimetry to be sensitive to the properties of dust aggregates,
such as size and porosity, which might have been influenced by evolutionary
processes. On the other hand, the Red-domain polarimetry reflects the
characteristics of sub-$\mu$m constituents in the aggregate.

for the differences of the coefficients, then at most finitely many eigenvalues
appear in the spectral gaps. This observation extends a seminal result by
Rofe-Beketov from the 1960s. Finally, imposing a second moment condition we
show that the band edges are no eigenvalues of the perturbed operator.

relate it to the question of the desingularization of Einstein metrics. Our
main application is a negative answer to the long-standing question of whether
or not every Einstein $4$-orbifold (which is an Einstein metric space in a
synthetic sense) is limit of smooth Einstein $4$-manifolds. We more precisely
show that spherical and hyperbolic $4$-orbifolds with the simplest
singularities cannot be Gromov-Hausdorff limits of smooth Einstein $4$-metrics
without relying on previous integrability assumptions. For this, we analyze the
integrability of deformations of Ricci-flat ALE metrics through variations of
Schoen's Pohozaev identity. Inspired by Taub's preserved quantity in General
Relativity, we also introduce preserved integral quantities based on the
symmetries of Einstein metrics. These quantities are obstructions to the
integrability of infinitesimal Einstein deformations ""closing up"" inside a
hypersurface - even with change of topology. We show that many previously
identified obstructions to the desingularization of Einstein $4$-metrics are
equivalent to these quantities on Ricci-flat cones. In particular, all of the
obstructions to desingularizations bubbling out Eguchi-Hanson metrics are
recovered. This lets us further interpret the obstructions to the
desingularization of Einstein metrics as a defect of integrability.

the goal is to equally distribute the loads among the nodes, by preforming
local load exchanges. While load balancing was extensively studied in static
networks, only recently a load balancing algorithm for dynamic networks with a
bounded convergence time was presented. In this paper, we further study the
time complexity of load balancing in the context of dynamic networks.
  First, we show that randomness is not necessary, and present a deterministic
algorithm which slightly improves the running time of the previous algorithm,
at the price of not being matching-based. Then, we consider integral loads,
i.e., loads that cannot be split indefinitely, and prove that no matching-based
algorithm can have a bounded convergence time for this case.
  To circumvent both this impossibility result, and a known one for the
non-integral case, we apply the method of smoothed analysis, where random
perturbations are made over the worst-case choices of network topologies. We
show both impossibility results do not hold under this kind of analysis,
suggesting that load-balancing in real world systems might be faster than the
lower bounds suggest.

divided into two categories: discrete packet routing models and continuous flow
over time models. Despite very vital research activities on models in both
categories, the connection between these approaches was poorly understood so
far. In this work we build this connection by specifying a (competitive) packet
routing model, which is discrete in terms of flow and time, and by proving its
convergence to the intensively studied model of flows over time with
deterministic queuing. More precisely, we prove that the limit of the
convergence process, when decreasing the packet size and time step length in
the packet routing model, constitutes a flow over time with multiple
commodities. In addition, we show that the convergence result implies the
existence of approximate equilibria in the competitive version of the packet
routing model. This is of significant interest as exact pure Nash equilibria,
similar to almost all other competitive models, cannot be guaranteed in the
multi-commodity setting. Moreover, the introduced packet routing model with
deterministic queuing is very application-oriented as it is based on the
network loading module of the agent-based transport simulation MATSim. As the

for solving the equation for the control function, governed by a sum of the
elliptic operator and its inverse $M=A + A^{-1}$, both discretized over large
$n^{\otimes d}$, $d=2,3$, spatial grids. Two basic solution schemes are
proposed and analyzed. In the first approach, one solves iteratively the
initial linear system of equations with the matrix $M$ such that the matrix
vector multiplication with the elliptic operator inverse, $y=A^{-1} u,$ is
performed as an embedded iteration by using a rank-structured solver for the
equation of the form $A y=u$. The second numerical scheme avoids the embedded
iteration by reducing the initial equation to an equivalent one with the
polynomial system matrix of the form $A^2 +I$. For both schemes, a low
Kronecker rank spectrally equivalent preconditioner is constructed by using the
corresponding matrix valued function of the anisotropic Laplacian diagonalized
in the Fourier basis. Numerical tests for control problems in 2D setting
confirm the linear-quadratic complexity scaling of the proposed method in the
univariate grid size $n$. Further, we numerically demonstrate that for our low
rank solution method, a cascadic multigrid approach reduces the number of PCG
iterations considerably, however the total CPU time remains merely the same as
for the unigrid iteration.

annihilation into two photons up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD
corrections by using the principle of maximum conformality (PMC). The
conventional perturbative QCD prediction shows strong scale dependence and
deviates largely from the BESIII measurements. After applying the PMC, we
obtain a more precise scale-invariant pQCD prediction, which also agrees with
the BESIII measurements within errors, i.e.
$R={\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}(\chi_{c2})}
/{\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}(\chi_{c0})}=0.246\pm0.013$, where the error is for
$\Delta\alpha_s(M_\tau)=\pm0.016$. By further considering the color-octet
contributions, even the central value can be in agreement with the data. This
shows the importance of a correct scale-setting approach. We also give a
prediction for the ratio involving $\chi_{b0, b2} \to\gamma\gamma$, which could
be tested in future Belle II experiment.

decompositions have been computed in several cases, providing deep new insight
into absolute Galois groups. The surprising result in each case is that there
are far fewer isomorphism types of indecomposables than one would expect
generically, with summands predominately free over associated quotient rings.
Though non-free summands are the exception both in their form and prevalence,
they play the critical role in controlling arithmetic conditions in the field

Here, based on first-principles calculations, we first show that
quasi-one-dimensional compound (NbSe4)2I represents a rare example of a chiral
Weyl semimetal in which the set of symmetry-related Weyl points (WPs) exhibit
the same chiral charge at a certain energy. The net chiral charge (NCC) of the
below Fermi level EF (or a certain energy) can be tuned by pressure. In
addition, a partial disorder induced by pressure accompanied with
superconductivity emerges. Although amorphization of the iodine sub-lattice
under high pressure, the one-dimensional NbSe4 chains in (NbSe4)2I remain
intact and provide a superconducting channel in one dimension. Our combined
theoretical and experimental research provide critical insight into a new phase

measures mean edge capacity and line load. These five methods are tested on how
well they can predict the collapse point of the giant component of a network
under random attack. The analysis uses seven power-grid networks, ranging from
14 to 2000 nodes. In total, 3456 load profiles are created for each network by
loading the edges of the network to have a range of tolerances and
concentrating network capacity into fewer edges. One hundred random attack
sequences are generated for each load profile, and the mean number of attacks
required for the giant component to collapse for each profile is recorded. The
relationship between the embedding values for each load profile and the mean
collapse point is then compared across all five methods. It is found that only
SETSe and line load perform well as proxies for robustness with $R^2 = 0.89$

line load performs exceptionally well ($R=0.99$). However, the SETSe algorithm
provides valuable qualitative insight into the state of the power-grid by
leveraging its method local smoothing and global weighting of node features to
provide an interpretable geographical embedding. This paper shows that graph

model's equilibrium point be regarded as the solution of an optimization
problem? To this end, we first decompose DNNs into a new class of unit layer
that is the proximal operator of an implicit convex function while keeping its
output unchanged. Then, the equilibrium model of the unit layer can be derived,
named Optimization Induced Equilibrium Networks (OptEq), which can be easily
extended to deep layers. The equilibrium point of OptEq can be theoretically
connected to the solution of its corresponding convex optimization problem with
explicit objectives. Based on this, we can flexibly introduce prior properties
to the equilibrium points: 1) modifying the underlying convex problems
explicitly so as to change the architectures of OptEq; and 2) merging the
information into the fixed point iteration, which guarantees to choose the
desired equilibrium point when the fixed point set is non-singleton. We show
that deep OptEq outperforms previous implicit models even with fewer
parameters. This work establishes the first step towards the
optimization-guided design of deep models.

and the substrate, which can be controlled by their relative orientation. We
argue that the periodic nature of these patterns emanates from an energetic
balance between the resistance of the top membrane to bending, which favors
large wavelength of wrinkles, and the membrane-substrate vdW attraction, which
favors small wrinkle amplitude. Employing the classical ""Winkler foundation""
model of elasticity theory, we show that the number of radial wrinkles conveys
a valuable relationship between the bending rigidity of the top membrane and
the strength of the vdW interaction. Armed with this relationship, we use our
data to demonstrate a nontrivial dependence of the bending rigidity on the
number of layers in the top membrane, which shows two different regimes driven
by slippage between the layers, and a high sensitivity of the vdW force to the
alignment between the substrate and the membrane.

quantum systems suffer errors, e.g., due to imperfect devices, environments, or
faulty channels. By now, a plethora of families of codes is known, but there is
no universal approach to finding new or optimal codes for a certain task and
subject to specific experimental constraints. In particular, once found, a QECC
is typically used in very diverse contexts, while its resilience against errors
is captured in a single figure of merit, the distance of the code. This does
not necessarily give rise to the most efficient protection possible given a
certain known error or a particular application for which the code is employed.
In this paper, we investigate the loss channel, which plays a key role in
quantum communication, and in particular in quantum key distribution over long
distances. We develop a numerical set of tools that allows to optimize an
encoding specifically for recovering lost particles both deterministically and
probabilistically, where some knowledge about what was lost is available, and
demonstrate its capabilities. This allows us to arrive at new codes ideal for
the distribution of entangled states in this particular setting, and also to
investigate if encoding in qudits or allowing for non-deterministic correction
proves advantageous compared to known QECCs. While we here focus on the case of
losses, our methodology is applicable whenever the errors in a system can be
characterized by a known linear map.

system is that dipolar interactions on their own are sufficient for creation of
a self-bound state and no additional short-range potential is needed for the

ground-state phase diagram that contains quantum phase transitions between
liquid, solid, atomic gas, and molecular gas phases. The stabilization
mechanism of the liquid phase is consistent with the microscopic scenario in
which the effective dimer-dimer attraction is balanced by an effective

extremely small, can be controlled by the interlayer distance. From the

remains viable within the context of recent measurements of the speed of
propagation of GWs is the teleparallel analogue of Horndeski gravity. In this
work, we explore the polarization structure of this newly proposed formulation
of Horndeski theory. In curvature-based gravity, Horndeski theory is almost
synonymous with extensions to GR since it spans a large portion of these
possible extensions. We perform this calculation by taking perturbations about
a Minkowski background and consider which mode propagates. The result is that
the polarization structure depends on the choice of model parameters in the
teleparallel Horndeski Lagrangian with a maximum of seven propagating degrees
of freedom. While the curvature-based Horndeski results follows as a particular
limit within this setup, we find a much richer structure of both massive and
massless cases which produce scalar--vector--tensor propagating degrees of
freedom. We also find that the GW polarization that emerges from the
teleparallel analogue of Horndeski gravity results in analogous massive and
massless modes which take on at most four polarizations in the massless sector

necessitated the need to reduce the abstraction levels in hardware design. Open

recent introduction of open source Process Development Kit (OpenPDK) by
Skywater technologies in June 2020 has eliminated the barriers to
Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design, which is otherwise

concrete step towards achieving the goal of open source circuit blocks that can
be imported to reuse and modify in ASIC design. With process technologies
scaling down for better performance, the need for entirely digital designs,
which can be synthesized in any standard Automatic Place-and-Route (APR) tool,
has increased considerably, for mapping physical design to the new process
technology. This work presents the first open source all-digital
Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) for multi-GHz serial links designed using
Skywater OpenPDK 130nm process node. To ensure that the design is fully
synthesizable, the SerDes uses CMOS inverter-based drivers at the Tx, while the
Rx front end comprises a resistive feedback inverter as a sensing element,
followed by sampling elements. A fully digital oversampling CDR at the Rx
recovers the Tx clock for proper decoding of data bits. The physical design
flow utilizes OpenLANE, which is an end-to-end tool for generating GDS from
RTL. Virtuoso has been used for extracting parasitics for post-layout

accuracy of this method is judged against previous method based on the
stiffness degradation of liquid regions by comparing the plastic deformation as
a function of time induced by thermal stresses. The method is used to
investigate residual stresses parallel and perpendicular to the laser scan

along those directions. The magnitude of the residual stress can be predicted
as a function of the depth, grain orientation and position with respect to the

topologies of signed mass black holes used in the construction may be either
spheres $S^3$ or rings $S^1 \times S^2$; in particular, the negative mass

facilitates the superposition is the fact that, in Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates,
negative mass singularities arise as overlapping singular support for a
particular type of Green's function. Furthermore, a careful analysis of conical
singularities along axes is performed, and formulas are obtained for their
propagation across horizons, negative mass singularities, and corners. The
methods are robust, and may be used to construct a multitude of further

there are few techniques specially dedicated to solve the problem of how to
incorporate categorical features to regression problems. Usually, categorical
feature encoders are general enough to cover both classification and regression
problems. This lack of specificity results in underperforming regression
models. In this paper,we provide an in-depth analysis of how to tackle high
cardinality categor-ical features with the quantile. Our proposal outperforms
state-of-the-encoders, including the traditional statistical mean target
encoder, when considering the Mean Absolute Error, especially in the presence
of long-tailed or skewed distributions. Besides, to deal with possible
overfitting when there are categories with small support, our encoder benefits
from additive smoothing. Finally, we describe how to expand the encoded values
by creating a set of features with different quantiles. This expanded encoder
provides a more informative output about the categorical feature in question,
further boosting the performance of the regression model.

This is achieved by means of a partial gauge fixing of diffeomorphisms together
with a careful definition of the unimodular measure. The statement holds also
in the presence of matter. As an explicit example, we consider scalar-tensor
theories and compute the corresponding logarithmic divergences in both

have caused great challenges for the online training and corresponding
applications of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially in resource-limited
devices. Existing works only focus on the convolution or BN acceleration and no
solution can alleviate both problems with satisfactory performance. Online
training has gradually become a trend in resource-limited devices like mobile
phones while there is still no complete technical scheme with acceptable model
performance, processing speed, and computational cost. In this research, an
efficient online-training quantization framework termed EOQ is proposed by
combining Fixup initialization and a novel quantization scheme for DNN model
compression and acceleration. Based on the proposed framework, we have
successfully realized full 8-bit integer network training and removed BN in
large-scale DNNs. Especially, weight updates are quantized to 8-bit integers
for the first time. Theoretical analyses of EOQ utilizing Fixup initialization
for removing BN have been further given using a novel Block Dynamical Isometry
theory with weaker assumptions. Benefiting from rational quantization
strategies and the absence of BN, the full 8-bit networks based on EOQ can
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and immense advantages in computational cost
and processing speed. What is more, the design of deep learning chips can be
profoundly simplified for the absence of unfriendly square root operations in
BN. Beyond this, EOQ has been evidenced to be more advantageous in small-batch
online training with fewer batch samples. In summary, the EOQ framework is
specially designed for reducing the high cost of convolution and BN in network
training, demonstrating a broad application prospect of online training in
resource-limited devices.

we propose a distillation-based framework that incorporates a new subcategory
of Positive-Unlabeled learning. In particular, we shall assume that a small
subset of any given noisy dataset is known to have correct labels, which we

""unlabeled"". Our framework consists of the following two components: (1) We
shall generate, via iterative updates, an augmented clean subset with
additional reliable ""positive"" samples filtered from ""unlabeled"" samples; (2)
We shall train a teacher model on this larger augmented clean set. With the
guidance of the teacher model, we then train a student model on the whole
dataset. Experiments were conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset with synthetic
label noise at multiple noise levels for both symmetric and asymmetric noise.
The results show that our framework generally outperforms at medium to high

rooted in information theory and developed in computational neuroscience, to

principle suggests that a good network structure should maximize the mutual
information between inputs and outputs, or equivalently maximize the entropy of
outputs under mild assumptions. We further establish connections between this
principle and the theory of Bayesian optimal classification, and empirically
verify that larger entropy of the outputs of a deep neural network indeed
corresponds to a better classification accuracy. Then as an implementation of
the principle, we show that sparse coding can effectively maximize the entropy
of the output signals, and accordingly design an algorithm based on global
group sparse coding to automatically learn the inter-layer connection and
determine the depth of a neural network. Our experiments on a public image
classification dataset demonstrate that using the structure learned from
scratch by our proposed algorithm, one can achieve a classification accuracy
comparable to the best expert-designed structure (i.e., convolutional neural
networks (CNN)). In addition, our proposed algorithm successfully discovers the
local connectivity (corresponding to local receptive fields in CNN) and
invariance structure (corresponding to pulling in CNN), as well as achieves a
good tradeoff between marginal performance gain and network depth.

replacement for quantum mechanics was discussed by J. von Neumann in 1932. His
proof was criticized as being logically circular, by Grete Hermann soon after,
and as fundamentally flawed, by John Bell in 1964. Bell's severe criticism of
Neumann's proof and the explicit (counter) example of a hidden variable model
for the measurement of a quantum spin are considered by most researchers,
though not all, as the definitive demonstration that Neumann's proof is
inadequate. Despite being an argument of mathematical physics, an ambiguity of
decision remains to this day. I show that Neumann's assumption of the linear
additivity of the expectation values, even for incompatible (noncommuting)
observables, is a necessary constraint related to the nature of observable
physical variables and to the conservation laws. Therefore, any theory should
necessarily obey it to qualify as a physically valid theory. Then, obviously,
the hidden variable theories with dispersion-free ensembles that violate this
assumption are ruled out. I show that it is Bell's counter-example that is
fundamentally flawed, being inconsistent with the factual mechanics. Further,
it is shown that the local hidden variable theories, for which the Bell's
inequalities were derived, are grossly incompatible with the fundamental
conservation laws. I identify the intrinsic uncertainty in the action as the
reason for the irreducible dispersion, which implies that there are no
dispersion-free ensembles at any scale of mechanics. With the unconditional
validity of its central assumption shown, Neumann's proof is fully resurrected.

motifs, both for dense (e.g., k-cliques) and for sparse ones (e.g., k-stars).
We consistently outperform the best available competitor by more than 10% on
average and up to 32% in area under the curve. Importantly, the advantages of
our approach over schemes based on uncorrelated link prediction increase with
the increasing motif size and complexity. We also successfully apply our
architecture for predicting more arbitrary clusters and communities,
illustrating its potential for graph mining beyond motif analysis.

assuming the pressure anisotropy. The proposed model is singularity free. The
model is obtained by considering a physically reasonable choice for the metric
potential $g_{rr}$ which depends on a dimensionless parameter `n'. The effect
of $n$ is discussed numerically, analytically and through plotting. We have
concentrated a wide range for n ($10\leq n \leq 1000$) for drawing the profiles
of different physical parameters. The maximum allowable mass for different
values of $n$ have been obtained by M-R plot. We have checked that the
stability of the model is increased for larger value of $n$. For the viability
of the model we have considered two compact stars PSR J1614-2230 and EXO

the data distribution and capture global semantic and syntactic features of
sentences. The prominent approach to train such models is variational
autoencoders (VAE). It is nevertheless challenging to train and often results
in a trivial local optimum where the latent variable is ignored and its
posterior collapses into the prior, an issue known as posterior collapse.
Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue. Most of them
focus on improving the inference model to yield latent codes of higher quality.
The present work proposes a short run dynamics for inference. It is initialized
from the prior distribution of the latent variable and then runs a small number
(e.g., 20) of Langevin dynamics steps guided by its posterior distribution. The
major advantage of our method is that it does not require a separate inference
model or assume simple geometry of the posterior distribution, thus rendering
an automatic, natural and flexible inference engine. We show that the models
trained with short run dynamics more accurately model the data, compared to
strong language model and VAE baselines, and exhibit no sign of posterior
collapse. Analyses of the latent space show that interpolation in the latent
space is able to generate coherent sentences with smooth transition and
demonstrate improved classification over strong baselines with latent features
from unsupervised pretraining. These results together expose a well-structured
latent space of our generative model.

reversible convolution and linear operation modules. Furthermore, this paper
sorted out the current public data set of facial emotion images, made a new

results show that, under the traditional convolutional neural network, the
3-layer 3*3 convolution kernel is more conducive to extracte the features of
the face images. The introduction of principal component decomposition can
improve the convergence speed of the model.

advances in human localisation and skeleton pose estimation to extract spatial

that body positions can be effectively recognised and provide useful evidence
for fall risk assessment. This work highlights the benefits of video-based

could enable sufficient lead time for healthcare professionals to respond and

and velocity measurement and high-resolution microwave imaging is proposed and
experimentally demonstrated by using a composite transmitted microwave signal
of a single-chirped linearly frequency-modulated (LFM) signal and a single-tone
microwave signal. In the system, the transmitted signal is generated via
photonic frequency up-conversion based on a single integrated dual-polarization
dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (DPol-DPMZM), whereas the echo signals
scattered from the target are de-chirped to two low-frequency signals using a
microwave photonic frequency mixer. By using the two low-frequency de-chirped
signals, the real-time distance and radial velocity of the moving target can be
measured accurately according to the round-trip time of the echo signal and its
Doppler frequency shift. Compared with the previous reported distance and
velocity measurement methods, where two LFM signals with opposite chirps are
used, these parameters can be obtained using only a single-chirped LFM signal
and a single-tone microwave signal. Meanwhile, high-resolution inverse
synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging can also be realized using ISAR imaging
algorithms. An experiment is performed to verify the proposed multi-functional
microwave photonic radar system. An up-chirped LFM signal from 8.5 to 12.5 GHz
and an 8.0 GHz single-tone microwave signal are used as the transmitted signal.
The results show that the absolute measurement errors of distance and radial
velocity are less than 5.9 cm and 2.8 cm/s, respectively. ISAR imaging results
are also demonstrated, which proves the high-resolution and real-time ISAR
imaging ability of the proposed system.

changes near their location on-device. While they are designed to measure the
temperature of the device components such as the battery, they can also sense
changes in the temperature of the ambient environment or thermal entities in
contact with the device. We have developed a model to estimate core body
temperature from signals sensed by these thermistors during a user interaction
in which the user places the capacitive touchscreen of a smart device against a
thermal site on their body such as their forehead. During the interaction, the
device logs the temperature sensed by the thermistors as well as the raw
capacitance seen by the touch screen to capture features describing the rate of
heat transfer from the body to the device and device-to-skin contact
respectively. These temperature and contact features are then used to model the
rate of heat transferred from the user's body to the device and thus core-body
temperature of the user for ubiquitous and accessible fever monitoring using
only a smart device. We validate this system in a lab environment on a

An open problem of homotopy theory is to determine a minimal set of
$A$-generators for the polynomial ring $P_q = k[x_1, \ldots, x_q] =
H^{*}(k^{q}, k)$ on $q$ generators $x_1, \ldots, x_q$ with $|x_i|= 1.$
Equivalently, one can write down explicitly a basis for the graded vector space
$Q^{\otimes q} := k\otimes_{A} P_q$ in each non-negative degree $n.$ This is
the content of the classical ""hit problem"" in literature [30]. Based on this
problem, we are interested in the $q$-th cohomological transfer $Tr_q^{A}$ of
Singer [39], which is one of the useful tools for describing mod-2 cohomology
of the algebra $A.$ This transfer is a linear map from the space of
$GL_q(k)$-coinvariant $k\otimes _{GL_q(k)} P((P_q)_n^{*})$ of $Q^{\otimes q}$
to the $k$-cohomology group of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{A}^{q, q+n}(k,
k).$ Here $GL_q(k)$ is the general linear group of degree $q$ over the field
$k,$ and $P((P_q)_n^{*})$ is the primitive part of $(P_q)^{*}_n$ under the
action of $A.$ Singer conjectured that $Tr_q^{A}$ is a monomorphism, but this
remains unanswered for all $q\geq 4.$ The present paper is to devoted to the
investigation of this conjecture for the rank 4 case. More specifically, basing
the techniques of the hit problem of four variables, we explicitly determine
the structure of $k\otimes _{GL_4(k)} P((P_4)_{n}^{*})$ in some generic degrees
$n.$ Applying these results and a representation of $Tr_4^{A}$ over the lambda
algebra, we notice that Singer's conjecture is true for the rank 4 transfer in
those degrees $n$. Also, we give some conjectures on the dimensions of
$k\otimes_{GL_q(k)} ((P_4)_n^{*})$ for the remaining degrees $n.$ As a
consequence, Singer's conjecture holds for $Tr_4^{A}.$ This study and our
previous results have been provided a panorama of the behavior of the fourth
cohomological transfer.
