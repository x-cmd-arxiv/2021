ultracold two-dimensional (2D) ion crystals in a Penning trap with a rotating
wall. The large magnetic field of the trap splits the modes that describe
in-plane motion of the ions into two branches: High frequency cyclotron modes
dominated by kinetic energy and low frequency $\mathbf{E \times B}$ modes
dominated by potential energy associated with thermal position displacements.
Using an eigenmode analysis we extract the equilibration rate between these two
branches as a function of the ratio of the frequencies that characterize the
two branches and observe this equilibration rate to be exponentially suppressed
as the ratio increases. Under experimental conditions relevant for current work
at NIST, the predicted equilibration time is orders of magnitude longer than
any relevant experimental timescales. We also study the coupling rate
dependence on the thermal temperature and the number of ions. Besides, we show
how increasing the rotating wall strength improves crystal stability. These
details of in-plane mode dynamics help set the stage for developing strategies
to efficiently cool the in-plane modes and improve the performance of
single-plane ion crystals for quantum information processing.

physical parameters in their approach to their reconstruction of data (but they
do depend on statistical hyperparameters). We firstly show how both GP and
LOESS-Simex can be used to successively reconstruct various data sets to a high
level of precision. We then directly compare both approaches in a quantitative
manner by considering several factors, such as how well the reconstructions
approximate the data sets themselves to how their respective uncertainties
evolve. In light of the puzzling Hubble tension, it is important to consider
how the uncertain regions evolve over redshift and the methods compare for
estimating cosmological parameters at current times. For cosmic chronometers
and baryonic acoustic oscillation compiled data sets, we find that GP
generically produce smaller variances for the reconstructed data with a minimum
value of $\sigma_{\rm GP-min} = 1.1$, while the situation for LS is totally
different with a minimum of $\sigma_{\rm LS-min} = 50.8$. Moreover, some of
these characteristics can be alleviate at low $z$, where LS presents less
underestimation in comparison to GP.

to our task a co-FCN originally applied to organs segmentation in volumetric

performance of the network on the WSIs of the remaining centers. We also
developed an automated selection strategy for selecting the conditioning
subset, based on an unsupervised clustering process applied to a
target-specific set of reference patches, followed by a selection policy that
relies on the cluster similarities with the input patch. We benchmarked our
proposed method against a U-Net trained on the same dataset with no
conditioning. The conditioned network shows better performance that the U-Net
on the WSIs with Isolated Tumor Cells and micro-metastases from the medical

conceiving several electromagnetic and optical devices based on the anomalous
scattering response arising at a single or multiple sudden changes of the
material properties. However, they are difficult to implement in realistic
scenarios by switching the permittivity of a material in time, and new
strategies to achieve time interfaces in a feasible manner must be identified.
In this paper, we investigate the possibility to realize a temporal
metamaterial without acting on the material properties, but rather on the
effective refractive index and wave impedance perceived by the wave during the
propagation in an empty guiding structure by varying the boundaries in time. We
demonstrate analytically and through numerical experiments that suddenly
changing the physical distance between the metallic plates of a parallel-plate
waveguide will induce an effective temporal interface. In addition to the
standard backward and forward scattered fields at different frequencies due to
the temporal interface, we also identify the presence of a static field
necessary to satisfy the continuity of the electromagnetic field across the
interface. The proposed concept can be extended to temporally controlled
metasurfaces, opening an easier path to the design and realization of novel
devices based on time-varying metamaterials at microwave and optical
frequencies.

learning ensemble models in predicting county-level corn yields across the US
Corn Belt (12 states). The developed data set is a combination of management,
environment, and historical corn yields from 1980-2019. Two scenarios for
ensemble creation are considered: homogenous and heterogeneous ensembles. In
homogenous ensembles, the base CNN-DNN models are all the same, but they are
generated with a bagging procedure to ensure they exhibit a certain level of
diversity. Heterogenous ensembles are created from different base CNN-DNN
models which share the same architecture but have different levels of depth.
Three types of ensemble creation methods were used to create several ensembles
for either of the scenarios: Basic Ensemble Method (BEM), Generalized Ensemble
Method (GEM), and stacked generalized ensembles. Results indicated that both
designed ensemble types (heterogenous and homogenous) outperform the ensembles
created from five individual ML models (linear regression, LASSO, random
forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM). Furthermore, by introducing improvements over
the heterogeneous ensembles, the homogenous ensembles provide the most accurate
yield predictions across US Corn Belt states. This model could make 2019 yield
predictions with a root mean square error of 866 kg/ha, equivalent to 8.5%
relative root mean square, and could successfully explain about 77% of the
spatio-temporal variation in the corn grain yields. The significant predictive
power of this model can be leveraged for designing a reliable tool for corn
yield prediction which will, in turn, assist agronomic decision-makers.

evaluation of existing and novel workflow algorithms and systems. In

suffer from several shortcomings that prevent easy adoption, maintenance, and
consistency with the evolving structures and computational requirements of
production workflows. In this work, we present WfCommons, a framework that

generators of synthetic workflows, and for simulating workflow executions. We
demonstrate the realism of the generated synthetic workflows by comparing their
simulated executions to real workflow executions. We also contrast these
results with results obtained when using the previously available collection of

by our framework not only generate representative same-scale workflows (i.e.,
with structures and task characteristics distributions that resemble those
observed in real-world workflows), but also do so at scales larger than that of
available real-world workflows. Finally, we conduct a case study to demonstrate
the usefulness of our framework for estimating the energy consumption of

gas dynamics using structured grids with embedded geometries. The novelty of
the proposed approach is the use of high-order discontinuous Galerkin (dG)
schemes and a shock-capturing Finite Volume (FV) scheme coupled via an $hp$
adaptive mesh refinement ($hp$-AMR) strategy that offers high-order accurate
resolution of the embedded geometries. The $hp$-AMR strategy is based on a
multi-level block-structured domain partition in which each level is
represented by block-structured Cartesian grids and the embedded geometry is
represented implicitly by a level set function. The intersection of the
embedded geometry with the grids produces the implicitly-defined mesh that
consists of a collection of regular rectangular cells plus a relatively small
number of irregular curved elements in the vicinity of the embedded boundaries.
High-order quadrature rules for implicitly-defined domains enable high-order
accuracy resolution of the curved elements with a cell-merging strategy to
address the small-cell problem. The $hp$-AMR algorithm treats the system with a
second-order finite volume scheme at the finest level to dynamically track the
evolution of solution discontinuities while using dG schemes at coarser levels
to provide high-order accuracy in smooth regions of the flow. On the dG levels,
the methodology supports different orders of basis functions on different
levels. The space-discretized governing equations are then advanced explicitly
in time using high-order Runge-Kutta algorithms. Numerical tests are presented
for two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems involving an ideal gas. The
results are compared with both analytical solutions and experimental
observations and demonstrate that the framework provides high-order accuracy

intensive deployment of base stations over the territory significantly
increases the level of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure and affects
population health. To alleviate this concern, in this work, we propose a
network architecture that introduces tethered unmanned aerial vehicles (TUAVs)
carrying green antennas to minimize the EMF exposure while guaranteeing a high
data rate for users. In particular, each TUAV can attach itself to one of the
possible ground stations at the top of some buildings. The location of the
TUAVs, transmit power of user equipment and association policy are optimized to
minimize the EMF exposure. Unfortunately, the problem turns out to be
mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP), which is non-deterministic
polynomial-time (NP) hard. We propose an efficient low-complexity algorithm
composed of three submodules. Firstly, we propose an algorithm based on the
greedy principle to determine the optimal association matrix between the users
and base stations. Then, we offer two approaches, a modified K-mean and shrink
and realign (SR) process, to associate each TUAV with a ground station.
Finally, we put forward two algorithms based on the golden search and SR
process to adjust the TUAV's position within the hovering area over the
building. After that, we consider the dual problem that maximizes the sum rate
while keeping the exposure below a predefined value, such as the level enforced
by the regulation. Next, we perform extensive simulations to show the
effectiveness of the proposed TUAVs to reduce the exposure compared to various
architectures. Eventually, we show that TUAVs with green antennas can
effectively mitigate the EMF exposure by more than 20% compared to fixed green

also be used to compute the output distribution for continuous-domain, which
can be viewed as an extension of regression task. Nevertheless, it is difficult
to explicitly approximate a distribution without knowing the information of its
general form a priori. In order to fit an arbitrary conditional distribution,
discretizing the continuous domain into bins is an effective strategy, as long
as we have sufficiently narrow bins and very large data. However, collecting
enough data is often hard to reach and falls far short of that ideal in many
circumstances, especially in multivariate CDE for the curse of dimensionality.
In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of modeling free-form conditional
distributions using a deconvolution-based neural net framework, coping with
data deficiency problems in discretization. It has the advantage of being
flexible but also takes advantage of the hierarchical smoothness offered by the

behind the triumphs of deep neural networks on practical challenges. However,
the gap between theory and practice is gradually starting to close. In this
paper I will attempt to assemble some pieces of the remarkable and still
incomplete mathematical mosaic emerging from the efforts to understand the
foundations of deep learning. The two key themes will be interpolation, and its
sibling, over-parameterization. Interpolation corresponds to fitting data, even
noisy data, exactly. Over-parameterization enables interpolation and provides
flexibility to select a right interpolating model.
  As we will see, just as a physical prism separates colors mixed within a ray
of light, the figurative prism of interpolation helps to disentangle
generalization and optimization properties within the complex picture of modern
Machine Learning. This article is written with belief and hope that clearer
understanding of these issues brings us a step closer toward a general theory
of deep learning and machine learning.

to user queries with background knowledge. For querying the absence of
information, however, there exist only few ontology-based approaches. Moreover,
these proposals conflate the closed-domain and closed-world assumption, and
therefore are not suited to deal with the anonymous objects that are common in
ontological reasoning. Many real-world applications, like processing electronic
health records (EHRs), also contain a temporal dimension, and require efficient
reasoning algorithms. Moreover, since medical data is not recorded on a regular
basis, reasoners must deal with sparse data with potentially large temporal
gaps. Our contribution consists of two main parts: In the first part we
introduce a new closed-world semantics for answering conjunctive queries with
negation over ontologies formulated in the description logic ELHb, which is
based on the minimal canonical model. We propose a rewriting strategy for
dealing with negated query atoms, which shows that query answering is possible
in polynomial time in data complexity. In the second part, we extend this
minimal-world semantics for answering metric temporal conjunctive queries with
negation over the lightweight temporal logic TELHb and obtain similar
rewritability and complexity results. This paper is under consideration in

In particular, machine learning is concerned with the development and
applications of algorithms that can recognize patterns in data and use them for
predictive modeling. Artificial neural networks are a particular class of
machine learning algorithms and models that evolved into what is now described
as deep learning. Given the computational advances made in the last decade,
deep learning can now be applied to massive data sets and in innumerable
contexts. Therefore, deep learning has become its own subfield of machine
learning. In the context of biological research, it has been increasingly used
to derive novel insights from high-dimensional biological data. To make the
biological applications of deep learning more accessible to scientists who have
some experience with machine learning, we solicited input from a community of
researchers with varied biological and deep learning interests. These
individuals collaboratively contributed to this manuscript's writing using the
GitHub version control platform and the Manubot manuscript generation toolset.
The goal was to articulate a practical, accessible, and concise set of
guidelines and suggestions to follow when using deep learning. In the course of
our discussions, several themes became clear: the importance of understanding
and applying machine learning fundamentals as a baseline for utilizing deep
learning, the necessity for extensive model comparisons with careful
evaluation, and the need for critical thought in interpreting results generated
by deep learning, among others.

data emerge daily. The short texts published on Twitter -- the tweets -- have
earned significant attention as a rich source of information to guide many
decision-making processes. However, their inherent characteristics, such as the
informal, and noisy linguistic style, remain challenging to many natural
language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis. Sentiment
classification is tackled mainly by machine learning-based classifiers. The
literature has adopted word representations from distinct natures to transform
tweets to vector-based inputs to feed sentiment classifiers. The
representations come from simple count-based methods, such as bag-of-words, to
more sophisticated ones, such as BERTweet, built upon the trendy BERT
architecture. Nevertheless, most studies mainly focus on evaluating those
models using only a small number of datasets. Despite the progress made in
recent years in language modelling, there is still a gap regarding a robust
evaluation of induced embeddings applied to sentiment analysis on tweets.
Furthermore, while fine-tuning the model from downstream tasks is prominent
nowadays, less attention has been given to adjustments based on the specific
linguistic style of the data. In this context, this study fulfils an assessment
of existing language models in distinguishing the sentiment expressed in tweets
by using a rich collection of 22 datasets from distinct domains and five
classification algorithms. The evaluation includes static and contextualized

results are in excellent agreement with the previous high-level calculations

representing the solvated systems are inexpensive and require $\sim 1000$

$\sim40\%$ of the total correlation energy. The solvent-to-solute feedback

due to their potential for achieving near-term quantum advantage. However, more
work is needed to understand their scalability. One known scaling result for
VQAs is barren plateaus, where certain circumstances lead to exponentially
vanishing gradients. It is common folklore that problem-inspired ansatzes avoid
barren plateaus, but in fact, very little is known about their gradient
scaling. In this work we employ tools from quantum optimal control to develop a
framework that can diagnose the presence or absence of barren plateaus for
problem-inspired ansatzes. Such ansatzes include the Quantum Alternating
Operator Ansatz (QAOA), the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA), and others.
With our framework, we prove that avoiding barren plateaus for these ansatzes
is not always guaranteed. Specifically, we show that the gradient scaling of
the VQA depends on the degree of controllability of the system, and hence can
be diagnosed through the dynamical Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ obtained from the
generators of the ansatz. We analyze the existence of barren plateaus in QAOA
and HVA ansatzes, and we highlight the role of the input state, as different
initial states can lead to the presence or absence of barren plateaus. Taken
together, our results provide a framework for trainability-aware ansatz design
strategies that do not come at the cost of extra quantum resources. Moreover,
we prove no-go results for obtaining ground states with variational ansatzes
for controllable system such as spin glasses. Our work establishes a link
between the existence of barren plateaus and the scaling of the dimension of
$\mathfrak{g}$.

existence implies the separability of the wave equation. Nevertheless, the
Carter operator is known to commute with the D'Alembertian only in the case of
a Ricci-flat metric. We show that, even though the Kerr-Newman spacetime
satisfies the non-vacuum Einstein-Maxwell equations, its curvature and
electromagnetic tensors satisfy peculiar properties which imply that the Carter
operator still commutes with the wave equation. This feature allows to adapt to
Kerr-Newman the physical-space analysis of the wave equation in Kerr by
Andersson-Blue, which avoids frequency decomposition of the solution by
precisely making use of the commutation with the Carter operator.
  We also extend the mathematical framework of physical-space analysis to the
case of the Einstein-Maxwell equations on Kerr-Newman spacetime, representing
coupled electromagnetic-gravitational perturbations of the rotating charged
black hole. The physical-space analysis is crucial in this setting as the
coupling of spin-1 and spin-2 fields in the axially symmetric background

formulate a joint optimization framework to minimize the average transmission
delay as a function of the caching variables and the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) which are determined by the
transmission powers, while explicitly accounting for backhaul connection costs
and the power constraints.
  Using convex relaxation and rounding, we obtain a reduced-complexity
formulation (RCF) of the joint optimization problem, which can provide a
constant factor approximation to the globally optimal solution. We then solve
RCF in two ways: 1) alternating optimization of the power and caching variables
by leveraging biconvexity, and 2) joint optimization of power control and
caching. We characterize the necessary (KKT) conditions for an optimal solution
to RCF, and use strict quasi-convexity to show that the KKT points are Pareto
optimal for RCF. We then devise a subgradient projection algorithm to jointly
update the caching and power variables, and show that under appropriate
conditions, the algorithm converges at a linear rate to the local minima of
RCF, under general SINR conditions. We support our analytical findings with

synaptic-level learning mechanism in specific brain regions that actualizes
learning. However, the exact nature of this mechanism remains unclear. Here we
propose an algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL) to generate and apply
a simple synaptic-level learning policy for multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
models. In this algorithm, the action space for each MLP synapse consists of a
small increase, decrease, or null action on the synapse weight, and the state
for each synapse consists of the last two actions and reward signals. A binary
reward signal indicates improvement or deterioration in task performance. The
static policy produces superior training relative to the adaptive policy and is
agnostic to activation function, network shape, and task. Trained MLPs yield
character recognition performance comparable to identically shaped networks
trained with gradient descent. 0 hidden unit character recognition tests
yielded an average validation accuracy of 88.28%, 1.86$\pm$0.47% higher than
the same MLP trained with gradient descent. 32 hidden unit character
recognition tests yielded an average validation accuracy of 88.45%,
1.11$\pm$0.79% lower than the same MLP trained with gradient descent. The
robustness and lack of reliance on gradient computations opens the door for new
techniques for training difficult-to-differentiate artificial neural networks
such as spiking neural networks (SNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
Further, the method's simplicity provides a unique opportunity for further
development of local rule-driven multi-agent connectionist models for machine

However, very little is known about even the basic properties of these domain

and magnetic susceptibility of a ferromagnetic (FM) Weyl semimetal CeAlSi using
scanning SQUID microscopy. We observed the ferromagnetic DWs lined-up with the
[100] direction (or other degenerate directions). We also discovered the
coexistence of stable and metastable domain phases, which arise likely due to
magnetoelastic and magnetostriction effects and are expected to be highly
tunable with small strains. We applied an in-plane external field as the CeAlSi
sample was cooled down to below the magnetic phase transition of 8.3K, showing
that the pattern of FM domains is strongly correlated with both the amplitude
and the orientation of the external field even for weak fields of a few Gauss.
The area of stable domains increases with field and reaches maximum when the
field is parallel to the main crystallographic axes of the CeAlSi crystal. Our
results suggest that the manipulation of these heterogeneous phases can provide
a practical way to study the interplay between magnetism and electronic
properties in Weyl systems, and that these systems can even serve as a new

into smaller computationally manageable subsets, running a sampling algorithm
in parallel on all the subsets, and combining parameter draws from all the

inference in massive data settings. A major restriction of existing
divide-and-conquer methods is that their first two steps assume that the
observations are independent. We address this problem by developing a
divide-and-conquer method for Bayesian inference in parametric hidden Markov
models, where the state space is known and finite. Our main contributions are
two-fold. First, after partitioning the data into smaller blocks of consecutive
observations, we modify the likelihood for performing posterior computations on
the subsets such that the posterior variances of the subset and true posterior
distributions have the same asymptotic order. Second, if the number of subsets
is chosen appropriately depending on the mixing properties of the hidden Markov
chain, then we show that the subset posterior distributions defined using the
modified likelihood are asymptotically normal as the subset sample size tends
to infinity. The latter result also implies that we can use any existing
combination algorithm in the third step. We show that the combined posterior
distribution obtained using one such algorithm is close to the true posterior
distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance under widely used regularity
assumptions. Our numerical results show that the proposed method provides an
accurate approximation of the true posterior distribution than its competitors

learning free-form physical laws for controlled dynamical systems given

set of assumptions about the properties of the underlying system is required,
which makes the model very rigid and unable to adapt to unforeseen changes in
the physical system. Neural networks, on the other hand, are known universal
function approximators but are prone to over-fit, limited accuracy, and bias
problems, which makes them alone unreliable candidates for such tasks. In this
paper, we propose SyReNets, an approach that leverages neural networks for
learning symbolic relations to accurately describe dynamic physical systems
from data. It explores a sequence of symbolic layers that build, in a residual
manner, mathematical relations that describes a given desired output from input
variables. We apply it to learn the symbolic equation that describes the
Lagrangian of a given physical system. We do this by only observing random
samples of position, velocity, and acceleration as input and torque as output.
Therefore, using the Lagrangian as a latent representation from which we derive
torque using the Euler-Lagrange equations. The approach is evaluated using a
simulated controlled double pendulum and compared with neural networks, genetic
programming, and traditional system identification. The results demonstrate
that, compared to neural networks and genetic programming, SyReNets converges
to representations that are more accurate and precise throughout the state
space. Despite having slower convergence than traditional system
identification, similar to neural networks, the approach remains flexible
enough to adapt to an unforeseen change in the physical system structure.

requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and
produce side effects (e.g., classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient
inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed
as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all previously mentioned
drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution uses the IsoMax
loss for training and the entropic score for out-of-distribution detection. The
IsoMax loss works as a drop-in replacement of the SoftMax loss (i.e., the
combination of the output linear layer, the SoftMax activation, and the
cross-entropy loss) because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss
requires no changes in the model's architecture or training
procedures/hyperparameters. In this paper, we perform what we call an
isometrization of the distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we
propose replacing the entropic score with the minimum distance score.
Experiments showed that these modifications significantly increase
out-of-distribution detection performance while keeping the solution seamless.
Besides being competitive with or outperforming all major current approaches,
the proposed solution avoids all their current limitations, in addition to
being much easier to use because only a simple loss replacement for training
the neural network is required. The code to replace the SoftMax loss with the
IsoMax+ loss and reproduce the results is available at

Increasing evidence suggests that high-altitude discharges (lightning) in
maturing plumes are driven by electrification processes that require the
formation of ice (analogous to processes underpinning meteorological
thunderstorms). However, electrical discharges are also common at or near the
volcanic vent. A number of ""ice-free"" electrification mechanisms have been
proposed to account for this activity: fractocharging, triboelectric charging,
radioactive charging, and charging through induction. Yet, the degree to which
each mechanism contributes to a jet's total electrification and how
electrification in the gas-thrust region influences electrostatic processes
aloft remains poorly constrained. Here, we use a shock-tube to simulate
overpressured volcanic jets capable of producing spark discharges in the
absence of ice. These discharges may be representative of the continual radio
frequency (CRF) emissions observed at a number of eruptions. Using a suite of
electrostatic sensors, we demonstrate the presence of size-dependent bipolar
charging (SDBC) in a discharge-bearing flow for the first time. SDBC has been
readily associated with triboelectric charging in other contexts and provides
direct evidence that contact and frictional electrification play significant
roles in electrostatic processes in the vent and near-vent regions of an
eruption. Additionally, we find that particles leaving the region where
discharges occur remain moderately electrified. This degree of electrification
may be sufficient to drive near-vent lightning higher in the column. Thus,
near-vent discharges may be underpinned by the same electrification mechanisms
driving CRF, albeit involving greater degrees of charge separation.

using an activity signature consisting of an ordered sequence of IP packets
with inter-packet time intervals. IoTAthena has two novel polynomial time
algorithms, sigMatch and actExtract. For any given signature, sigMatch can
capture all matches of the signature in the raw network traffic. Using sigMatch
as a subfunction, actExtract can accurately unveil the sequence of various IoT
device activities from the raw network traffic. Using the network traffic of
heterogeneous IoT devices collected at the router of a real-world smart home
testbed and a public IoT dataset, we demonstrate that IoTAthena is able to
characterize and generate activity signatures of IoT device activities and
accurately unveil the sequence of IoT device activities from raw network
traffic.

computationally efficient when combined with the random mini-batch strategy. By
splitting the potential energy into numerically nonstiff and stiff parts, one
makes a proposal using the nonstiff part of $U$, followed by a Metropolis
rejection step using the stiff part that is often easy to compute. The
splitting allows efficient sampling from systems with singular potentials (or
distributions with degenerate points) and/or with multiple potential barriers.
In our SHMC algorithm, the proposal only based on the nonstiff part in the
splitting is generated by the Hamiltonian dynamics, which can be potentially
more efficient than the overdamped Langevin dynamics. We also use random batch
strategies to reduce the computational cost to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ per time step
in generating the proposals for problems arising from many-body systems and
Bayesian inference, and prove that the errors of the Hamiltonian induced by the
random batch approximation is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\Delta t})$ in the strong and
$\mathcal{O}(\Delta t)$ in the weak sense, where $\Delta t$ is the time step.
Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results and the
computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms in practice.

oscillator (ASHO) field, whose potential strengths of different directions can
be controlled artificially. The shape of the neutron drop will change from
spherical to oblate or prolate according to the anisotropy of the external
field. With the potential strength increasing in the axial direction, the
neutron prefers to occupy the orbital perpendicular to the symmetry axis. On
the contrary, the neutron likes to stay in the orbital parallel to the symmetry
axis when the potential strength increases in the radial direction. Meanwhile,
when the potential strength of one direction disappears, the neutron drop
cannot bind together. These investigations are not only helpful to simulate the
properties of neutrons in finite nuclei but also provide the theoretical
predictions to the future artificial operations on the nuclei like the
ultracold atom system, for a deeper realization of quantum many-body systems.

machine learning, information, and communication technology. It is vital to the
development of machine learning, which is expected to be fully decentralized,
privacy-preserving, secure, and robust. However, general federated learning
settings with a central server can't meet requirements in decentralized

privacy-preserving global model training protocol, named PPT, for federated
learning in Peer-to-peer (P2P) Networks. PPT uses a one-hop communication form
to aggregate local model update parameters and adopts the symmetric
cryptosystem to ensure security. It is worth mentioning that PPT modifies the
Eschenauer-Gligor (E-G) scheme to distribute keys for encryption. In terms of
privacy preservation, PPT generates random noise to disturb local model update
parameters. The noise is eliminated ultimately, which ensures the global model
performance compared with other noise-based privacy-preserving methods in FL,
e.g., differential privacy. PPT also adopts Game Theory to resist collusion
attacks. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that PPT various security

learn the gradient of the unclosed high order moment, which performs much
better than learning the moment itself and the conventional $P_N$ closure.
However, the ML moment closure model in \cite{huang2021gradient} is not able to
guarantee hyperbolicity and long time stability. We propose in this paper a
method to enforce the global hyperbolicity of the ML closure model. The main
idea is to seek a symmetrizer (a symmetric positive definite matrix) for the
closure system, and derive constraints such that the system is globally
symmetrizable hyperbolic. It is shown that the new ML closure system inherits
the dissipativeness of the RTE and preserves the correct diffusion limit as the
Knunsden number goes to zero. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian
source problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, long time
stability and generalizability of our globally hyperbolic ML closure model.

studies predicted the existence of localized phonon modes at the interface

combination of Raman spectroscopy and high-energy resolution electron
energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a scanning transmission electron microscope,

modes at ~12 THz at a high-quality epitaxial Si-Ge interface. These modes are
further confirmed using molecular dynamics simulations with a high-fidelity

that measured from time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) experiments.

contains the subspace of the linear polynomials defined on each element. The
connection between the nonnegativity of the virtual element functions and the
nonnegativity of the degrees of freedom, i.e., the values at the mesh vertices,
is established by applying the Maximum and Minimum Principle Theorem. The mass
matrix is computed through an approximate L 2 polynomial projection, whose
properties are carefully investigated in the paper. We prove the well-posedness
of the resulting scheme in two different ways that reveal the contractive
nature of the VEM and its connection with the minimization of quadratic
functionals. The convergence analysis requires the existence of a nonnegative
quasi-interpolation operator, whose construction is also discussed in the
paper. The variational crime introduced by the virtual element setting produces
five error terms that we control by estimating a suitable upper bound.
Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence rate for the
refinement in space and time on three different mesh families including
distorted squares, nonconvex elements, and Voronoi tesselations.

we ask the participants to reconstruct the LaTeX structure code from an image.
In Subtask 2, we ask the participants to reconstruct the LaTeX content code

differentially private mechanisms. An interactive differentially private
mechanism is an algorithm that allows an analyst to adaptively ask queries
about a sensitive dataset, with the property that an adversarial analyst's view
of the interaction is approximately the same regardless of whether or not any
individual's data is in the dataset. Previous studies of composition of
differential privacy have focused on non-interactive algorithms, but
interactive mechanisms are needed to capture many of the intended applications
of differential privacy and a number of the important differentially private
primitives.
  We focus on concurrent composition, where an adversary can arbitrarily
interleave its queries to several differentially private mechanisms, which may
be feasible when differentially private query systems are deployed in practice.
We prove that when the interactive mechanisms being composed are pure
differentially private, their concurrent composition achieves privacy
parameters (with respect to pure or approximate differential privacy) that
match the (optimal) composition theorem for noninteractive differential
privacy. We also prove a composition theorem for interactive mechanisms that
satisfy approximate differential privacy. That bound is weaker than even the
basic (suboptimal) composition theorem for noninteractive differential privacy,
and we leave closing the gap as a direction for future research, along with
understanding concurrent composition for other variants of differential
privacy.

to first extract session demand and the underlying multiple demands of each
session is estimated using the global demand matrix. Then, the demand-aware
graph neural network is designed to extract session demand graph to learn the

information as much as possible and ensure that the extracted feature embedding
and other modal feature embedding have an excellent mutual understanding. The
latter is often more critical in feature fusion than the former. Therefore,
selecting the optimal feature extraction network collocation is a very
important subproblem in multimodal tasks. Most of the existing studies ignore
this problem or adopt an ergodic approach. This problem is modeled as an
optimization problem in this paper. A novel method is proposed to convert the
optimization problem into an issue of comparative upper bounds by referring to
the general practice of extreme value conversion in mathematics. Compared with
the traditional method, it reduces the time cost.
  Meanwhile, aiming at the common problem that the feature similarity and the
feature semantic similarity are not aligned in the multimodal time-series
problem, we refer to the idea of contrast learning and propose a multimodal
time-series contrastive loss(MTSC).
  Based on the above issues, We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach in

  Person Re-identification","Accepted by NeurIPS 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transformers have recently gained increasing attention in computer vision.
However, existing studies mostly use Transformers for feature representation
learning, e.g. for image classification and dense predictions, and the
generalizability of Transformers is unknown. In this work, we further
investigate the possibility of applying Transformers for image matching and
metric learning given pairs of images. We find that the Vision Transformer
(ViT) and the vanilla Transformer with decoders are not adequate for image
matching due to their lack of image-to-image attention. Thus, we further design
two naive solutions, i.e. query-gallery concatenation in ViT, and query-gallery
cross-attention in the vanilla Transformer. The latter improves the
performance, but it is still limited. This implies that the attention mechanism
in Transformers is primarily designed for global feature aggregation, which is
not naturally suitable for image matching. Accordingly, we propose a new
simplified decoder, which drops the full attention implementation with the
softmax weighting, keeping only the query-key similarity computation.
Additionally, global max pooling and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) head are
applied to decode the matching result. This way, the simplified decoder is
computationally more efficient, while at the same time more effective for image
matching. The proposed method, called TransMatcher, achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generalizable person re-identification, with up to 6.1% and 5.7%
performance gains in Rank-1 and mAP, respectively, on several popular datasets.

with the objective to drive the system from any given initial state to the
desired infection-free equilibrium state in minimal time. Using Pontryagin's

An interesting case to study is when $R$ is a Dedekind domain, in particular
when $R$ is the ring of integers of an algebraic number field. An algebraic
number field $K$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ is said to be a
P\'{o}lya field if the $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-module of integer-valued polynomials

main memory. A modern multi-core CPU generally employs a multi-level hierarchy
of caches, through which the most recently and frequently used data are
maintained in each core's local private caches while all cores share the
last-level cache (LLC). For inclusive caches, clean cache lines replaced in
higher-level caches are not necessarily copied back to lower levels, as the
inclusiveness implies their existences in lower levels. For exclusive and
non-inclusive caches that are widely utilized by Intel, AMD, and ARM today,
either indiscriminately copying back all or none of replaced clean cache lines
to lower levels raises no violation to exclusiveness and non-inclusiveness
definitions.
  We have conducted a quantitative study and found that, copying back all or
none of clean cache lines to lower-level cache of exclusive caches entails
suboptimal performance. The reason is that only a part of cache lines would be
reused and others turn to be dead in a long run. This observation motivates us
to selectively copy back some clean cache lines to LLC in an architecture of
exclusive or non-inclusive caches. We revisit the concept of reuse distance of
cache lines. In a nutshell, a clean cache line with a shorter reuse distance is
copied back to lower-level cache as it is likely to be re-referenced in the
near future, while cache lines with much longer reuse distances would be
discarded or sent to memory if they are dirty. We have implemented and
evaluated our proposal with non-volatile (STT-MRAM) LLC. Experimental results
with gem5 and SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks show that on average our proposal yields
up to 12.8% higher throughput of IPC (instructions per cycle) than the

results on different natural language processing tasks, they have large numbers
of parameters and suffer from big computational and memory costs, which make
them difficult for real-world deployment. Therefore, model compression is
necessary to reduce the computation and memory cost of pre-trained models. In
this work, we aim to compress BERT and address the following two challenging
practical issues: (1) The compression algorithm should be able to output
multiple compressed models with different sizes and latencies, in order to
support devices with different memory and latency limitations; (2) The
algorithm should be downstream task agnostic, so that the compressed models are
generally applicable for different downstream tasks. We leverage techniques in
neural architecture search (NAS) and propose NAS-BERT, an efficient method for
BERT compression. NAS-BERT trains a big supernet on a search space containing a
variety of architectures and outputs multiple compressed models with adaptive
sizes and latency. Furthermore, the training of NAS-BERT is conducted on
standard self-supervised pre-training tasks (e.g., masked language model) and
does not depend on specific downstream tasks. Thus, the compressed models can
be used across various downstream tasks. The technical challenge of NAS-BERT is
that training a big supernet on the pre-training task is extremely costly. We
employ several techniques including block-wise search, search space pruning,
and performance approximation to improve search efficiency and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on GLUE and SQuAD benchmark datasets demonstrate that
NAS-BERT can find lightweight models with better accuracy than previous
approaches, and can be directly applied to different downstream tasks with
adaptive model sizes for different requirements of memory or latency.

significant improvements on model performance can be achieved. Hence, a simple

stacking these ResNet-style EPSA blocks. Correspondingly, a stronger
multi-scale representation ability can be offered by the proposed EPSANet for
various computer vision tasks including but not limited to, image
classification, object detection, instance segmentation, etc. Without bells and

state-of-the-art channel attention methods. As compared to the SENet-50, the
Top-1 accuracy is improved by 1.93% on ImageNet dataset, a larger margin of

mechanics, and are a key object of interest in both theoretical studies and in
practical applications. So far, most of the studies were devoted to the
fluctuations in the time-averaged current -- the zero frequency Fourier
component of the time dependent current. However, in many practical
applications the fluctuations at other frequencies are of equal importance.
Here we study the full frequency dependence of current statistics in
periodically driven stochastic systems. First, we show a general method to
calculate the current statistics, valid even when the current's frequency is
incommensurate with the driving frequency, breaking the time periodicity of the
system. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the cumulant generating function
(CGF), that encodes all the statistics of the current, is composed of a
continuous background at any frequency accompanied by either positive or
negative peaks at current's frequencies commensurate with the driving
frequency. We show that cumulants of increasing orders display peaks at an
increasing number of locations but with decreasing amplitudes that depend on
the commensurate ratio of frequencies. All these peaks are then transcribed in
the behaviour of the CGF. As the measurement time increases, these peaks become
sharper but keep the same amplitude and eventually lead to discontinuities of
the CGF at all the frequencies that are commensurate with the driving frequency
in the limit of infinitely long measurement. We demonstrate our formalism and
its consequences on three types of models: an underdamped Brownian particle in
a periodically driven harmonic potential; a periodically driven run-and-tumble
particle; and a two-state system.

the computational domain is decomposed into two overlapping domains: the SIE
and PDE domains. In the SIE domain, complex structures with piecewise
homogeneous media, e.g., highly conductive media, are included. An equivalent
model for those structures is constructed by replacing them with the background
medium and introducing a surface equivalent electric current density on an

of the PDE domain, in which inhomogeneous or non-isotropic media are included.
Through combining the surface equivalent electric current density and the

crystallinity, which enhances charge transfer due to higher electron mobility
in anatase-rutile heterostructures but decreases visible light absorption, and
oxygen vacancy defects, which increase visible light absorption and

in primary care by taking patients to their GPs. As part of this setting, each
transportation request of a chronic or walk-in patient consists of an outbound
trip to the GP and an inbound trip back home. The economic sustainability of
patient transportation systems mainly depends on their utilization and how well
transportation requests can be bundled through ride sharing. To ease the
latter, we consider a flexible scheduling of chronic patients in which only a
certain range for an appointment is fixed a priori while the exact time is
determined by the scheduling of the outbound trip. This leads to a novel
extension of the dial-a-ride problem that we call the dial-a-ride problem with
combined requests and flexible scheduling (DARPCF). In this paper, we introduce
two heuristics for the DARPCF that exploit this increased flexibility. Both
approaches initially compute so-called mini-clusters of outbound requests.
Then, the mini-clusters are linked by (i) solving a traveling salesman problem
and creating routes of outbound rides with a splitting procedure or by (ii)
using a rolling horizon approach and solving bipartite matching problems for
the vehicle assignment. Our computational study shows that by using the
presented algorithms with the flexible scheduling of chronic appointments, the

  Complex System",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detecting anomalies in large complex systems is a critical and challenging
task. The difficulties arise from several aspects. First, collecting ground
truth labels or prior knowledge for anomalies is hard in real-world systems,
which often lead to limited or no anomaly labels in the dataset. Second,
anomalies in large systems usually occur in a collective manner due to the
underlying dependency structure among devices or sensors. Lastly, real-time
anomaly detection for high-dimensional data requires efficient algorithms that
are capable of handling different types of data (i.e. continuous and discrete).
We propose a correlation structure-based collective anomaly detection (CSCAD)
model for high-dimensional anomaly detection problem in large systems, which is
also generalizable to semi-supervised or supervised settings. Our framework
utilize graph convolutional network combining a variational autoencoder to
jointly exploit the feature space correlation and reconstruction deficiency of
samples to perform anomaly detection. We propose an extended mutual information
(EMI) metric to mine the internal correlation structure among different data
features, which enhances the data reconstruction capability of CSCAD. The
reconstruction loss and latent standard deviation vector of a sample obtained
from reconstruction network can be perceived as two natural anomalous degree
measures. An anomaly discriminating network can then be trained using low
anomalous degree samples as positive samples, and high anomalous degree samples
as negative samples. Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms all the competing baselines.

diversity-driven training strategy is proposed to improve diversity of

variation in hydration kinetics of the main constituent of cement, Tricalcium
Silicate, due to the addition of different percentages of nanosilica. The
variation has been analyzed in terms of change in the absorbance as well as a
shift in the wavenumber of the key resonances. The resonance around 520, 514
cm-1, due to symmetric-asymmetric bending of silicate tetrahedral units,
decreases in intensity very rapidly as hydration progresses and more so for the
nanosilica incorporated samples demonstrating accelerated hydration.
Interestingly, the resonance around 451 cm-1, due to symmetric and asymmetric
bending of silicate tetrahedral units along with some contribution of
vibrational modes of calcium oxide polyhedral units, does not show a similar
decrease in intensity. The prominence of the resonance around 451 cm-1 even
after the onset of hydration is found to be mostly due to the contribution from
the vibrational modes of the newly formed silicates tetrahedra chains of
calcium silicate hydrate. Early-stage formation of calcium silicate hydrate due

resonances as polymerized chains of silicates are formed. These results have

specifically, first of all, we conceive a holistic channel estimation protocol,
which integrates the existing channel estimation techniques and passive
beamforming design. Secondly, we propose a new channel training framework. In
contrast to the conventional channel estimation arrangements, our new framework
divides the training phase into several periods, where the superimposed
end-to-end channel is estimated instead of separately estimating the direct
BS-user channel and cascaded reflected BS-RIS-user channels. As a result, the
reflecting coefficients of the RIS are optimized by comparing the objective
function values over multiple training periods. Moreover, the theoretical
performance of our channel training protocol is analyzed and compared to that
under the optimal reflecting coefficients. In addition, the potential benefits
of our channel training protocol in reducing the complexity, pilot overhead as
well as signalling overhead are also detailed. Thirdly, we derive the
theoretical performance of channel estimation protocols and our channel
training protocol in the presence of noise for a SISO scenario, which provides
useful insights into the impact of the noise on the overall RIS performance.
Finally, our numerical simulations characterize the performance of the proposed
protocols and verify our theoretical analysis. In particular, the simulation
results demonstrate that our channel training protocol is more competitive than
the channel estimation protocol at low signal-to-noise ratios.

low-background searches, including neutrinoless double beta (0vbb) decay,
low-energy nuclear recoils, and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering.
The detectors feature an excellent energy resolution, low detection thresholds
down to the sub-keV range, and enhanced background rejection capabilities.
However, due to their large passivated surface, separating the signal readout
contact from the bias voltage electrode, PPC detectors are susceptible to
surface effects such as charge build-up. A profound understanding of their
response to surface events is essential. In this work, the response of a PPC
detector to alpha and beta particles hitting the passivated surface was
investigated in a multi-purpose scanning test stand. It is shown that the
passivated surface can accumulate charges resulting in a radial-dependent
degradation of the observed event energy. In addition, it is demonstrated that
the pulse shapes of surface alpha events show characteristic features which can
be used to discriminate against these events.

  Metrics for Open-domain Dialog Generation","ACL Findings 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The lack of reliable automatic evaluation metrics is a major impediment to
the development of open-domain dialogue systems. Various reference-based
metrics have been proposed to calculate a score between a predicted response
and a small set of references. However, these metrics show unsatisfactory
correlations with human judgments. For a reference-based metric, its
reliability mainly depends on two factors: its ability to measure the
similarity between the predicted response and the reference response, as well
as the reliability of the given reference set. Yet, there are few discussions
on the latter. Our work attempts to fill this vacancy. We first clarify an
assumption on reference-based metrics that, if more high-quality references are
added into the reference set, the reliability of the metric will increase.
Next, we present REAM$\sharp$: an enhancement approach to Reference-based
EvAluation Metrics for open-domain dialogue systems. A prediction model is
designed to estimate the reliability of the given reference set. We show how
its predicted results can be helpful to augment the reference set, and thus
improve the reliability of the metric. Experiments validate both the
effectiveness of our prediction model and that the reliability of
reference-based metrics improves with the augmented reference sets.

The overdensity inside a cosmological sub-volume and the tidal
fields from its surroundings affect the matter distribution of the region. The
resulting difference between the local and global power spectra is
characterized by the response function.
  Aims. Our aim is to provide a new, simple, and accurate formula for the power
spectrum overdensity response at highly nonlinear scales based on the results
of cosmological simulations and paying special attention to the lognormal
nature of the density field.
  Methods. We measured the dark matter power spectrum amplitude as a function
of the overdensity ($\delta_W$) in $N$-body simulation subsamples. We show that
the response follows a power-law form in terms of $(1+\delta_W)$, and we
provide a new fit in terms of the variance, $\sigma(L)$, of a sub-volume of
size $L$.
  Results. Our fit has a similar accuracy and a comparable complexity to
second-order standard perturbation theory on large scales, but it is also valid
for nonlinear (smaller) scales, where perturbation theory needs higher-order
terms for a comparable precision. Furthermore, we show that the lognormal
nature of the overdensity distribution causes a previously unidentified bias:
the power spectrum amplitude for a subsample with an average density is
typically underestimated by about $-2\sigma^2$. Although this bias falls to the
sub-percent level above characteristic scales of $200Mpch^{-1}$, taking it into
account improves the accuracy of estimating power spectra from zoom-in
simulations and smaller high-resolution surveys embedded in larger
low-resolution volumes.

representation learning of graph neural networks (GNNs): how to effectively
capture and represent useful information embedded in long-distance nodes to
improve the performance of nodes with low homophily without leading to
performance degradation in nodes with high homophily. This dilemma limits the
generalization capability of existing GNNs. Intuitively, interactions with
distant nodes introduce more noise for a node than those with close neighbors.
However, in most existing works, messages being passed among nodes are mingled
together, which is inefficient from a communication perspective. Our solution
is based on a novel, simple, yet effective aggregation scheme, resulting in a
ladder-style GNN architecture, namely LADDER-GNN. Specifically, we separate
messages from different hops, assign different dimensions for them, and then
concatenate them to obtain node representations. Such disentangled
representations facilitate improving the information-to-noise ratio of messages
passed from different hops. To explore an effective hop-dimension relationship,
we develop a conditionally progressive neural architecture search strategy.
Based on the searching results, we further propose an efficient approximate
hop-dimension relation function to facilitate the rapid configuration of the
proposed LADDER-GNN. We verify the proposed LADDER-GNN on seven diverse
semi-supervised node classification datasets. Experimental results show that
our solution achieves better performance than most existing GNNs. We further
analyze our aggregation scheme with two commonly used GNN architectures, and
the results corroborate that our scheme outperforms existing schemes in
classifying low homophily nodes by a large margin.

there are simple graph problems that GAT cannot express: in a controlled

modifying the order of operations and propose GATv2: a dynamic graph attention

as diffraction limited storage rings (DLSRs), whose emittance approaches the
diffraction limit for the range of X ray wavelengths of interest to the
scientific community, has garnered significant attention worldwide. Researchers
have begun to design and build DLSRs. Among various DLSR proposals, the hybrid
multibend achromat (HMBA) lattice enables sextupole strengths to be maintained
at a reasonable level when minimizing the emittance; hence, it has been adopted
in many DLSR designs. Based on the H7BA lattice, the design of the Advanced
Photon Source Upgrade Project (APSU) can effectively reduce emittance by
replacing six quadrupoles with antibends. Herein, we discuss the feasibility of
designing an APSU type HMBA lattice for the Southern Advanced Photon Source, a
mid energy DLSR light source with ultralow emittance that has been proposed to
be built adjacent to the China Spallation Neutron Source. Both linear and
nonlinear dynamics are optimized to obtain a detailed design of this type of
lattice. The emittance is minimized, while a sufficiently large dynamic
aperture (DA) and momentum acceptance (MA) are maintained. A design comprising
36 APSU type H7BAs, with an energy of 3 GeV and a circumference of 972 m, is
achieved. The horizontal natural emittance is 20 pm rad, with a horizontal DA
of 5.8 mm, a vertical DA of 4.5 mm, and an MA of 4%, as well as a long
longitudinal damping time of 120 ms. Subsequently, a few modifications are
performed based on the APSU type lattice to reduce the longitudinal damping
time from 120 to 44 ms while maintaining other performance parameters at the

emerging research field, the number of commands is also limited in relation to
the number of MI tasks; in the current literature, mostly two or four commands
(classes) are studied. As a solution to this problem, it is recommended to use
mental tasks as well as MI tasks. Unfortunately, the use of this approach
reduces the classification performance of MI EEG signals. The fMRI analyses
show that the resources in the brain associated with the motor imagery can be
activated independently. It is assumed that the brain activity induced by the
MI of the combination of body parts corresponds to the superposition of the
activities generated during each body parts's simple MI. In this study, in
order to create more than four BCI commands, we suggest to generate combined MI
EEG signals artificially by using left hand, right hand, tongue, and feet motor
imageries in pairs. A maximum of ten different BCI commands can be generated by
using four motor imageries in pairs.This study aims to achieve high
classification performances for BCI commands produced from four motor imageries
by implementing a small-sized deep neural network (DNN).The presented method is
evaluated on the four-class datasets of BCI Competitions III and IV, and an
average classification performance of 81.8% is achieved for ten classes. The
above assumption is also validated on a different dataset which consists of
simple and combined MI EEG signals acquired in real time. Trained with the
artificially generated combined MI EEG signals, DivFE resulted in an average of
76.5% success rate for the combined MI EEG signals acquired in real-time.

tendencies, with the nematic order being the most distinct form of order. Here
the intertwinement of the electronic nematicity with superconductivity in
cuprate superconductors is studied based on the kinetic-energy-driven
superconductivity. It is shown that the optimized Tc takes a dome-like shape
with the weak and strong strength regions on each side of the optimal strength
of the electronic nematicity, where the optimized Tc reaches its maximum. This
dome-like shape nematic-order strength dependence of Tc indicates that the
electronic nematicity enhances superconductivity. Moreover, this nematic order
induces the anisotropy of the electron Fermi surface (EFS), where although the
original EFS with the four-fold rotation symmetry is broken up into that with a
residual two-fold rotation symmetry, this EFS with the two-fold rotation
symmetry still is truncated to form the Fermi arcs with the most spectral
weight that locates at the tips of the Fermi arcs. Concomitantly, these tips of
the Fermi arcs connected by the wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i}$ construct an octet
scattering model, however, the partial wave vectors and their respective
symmetry-corresponding partners occur with unequal amplitudes, leading to these
ordered states being broken both rotation and translation symmetries. As a
natural consequence, the electronic structure is inequivalent between the
$k_{x}$ and $k_{y}$ directions. These anisotropic features of the electronic
structure are also confirmed via the result of the autocorrelation of the
single-particle excitation spectra, where the breaking of the rotation symmetry
is verified by the inequivalence on the average of the electronic structure at
the two Bragg scattering sites. Furthermore, the strong energy dependence of
the order parameter of the electronic nematicity is also discussed.

vanishes identically in materials described by this point group, in the
continuous limit. We use symmetry analysis to identify the only possible
contribution to the free energy density in two dimensions that is of the fourth

to its spatial derivatives. This contribution predicts long-range conical
magnetic spirals with both the average magnetization and the average chirality
dependent on the spiral propagation direction. We relate the predicted spirals

easy-plane materials, the same mechanism may stabilize bimerons.

decay rates of cavity mirrors. When the control laser is settled, the smaller
cavity decay rate causes the wider frequency range of CPA, and the input
intensity is larger to satisfy CPA condition for a given frequency. While the
cavity parameters are determined, Rabi frequency of the control laser has
little effect on the frequency range of CPA. However, with EIT-type quantum
interference, the CPA mode is tunable by the control laser. This means the CPA

text, but over time this task has been subdivided into smaller and smaller
sub-tasks, e,g,, target extraction or targeted polarity classification. We
argue that this division has become counterproductive and propose a new unified
framework to remedy the situation. We cast the structured sentiment problem as
dependency graph parsing, where the nodes are spans of sentiment holders,
targets and expressions, and the arcs are the relations between them. We
perform experiments on five datasets in four languages (English, Norwegian,
Basque, and Catalan) and show that this approach leads to strong improvements
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis shows that refining the sentiment
graphs with syntactic dependency information further improves results.

could constitute a key building block in future communication networks in the
6G era and beyond. These networks have an inherent feature of parallelism that
allows them to boost the capacity and enhance the security of communication
systems. Recent advances led to the deployment of small- and large-scale
quantum communication networks with real quantum hardware. In quantum networks,
entanglement is a key resource that allows for data transmission between
different nodes. However, to reap the benefits of entanglement and enable
efficient quantum communication, the number of generated entangled pairs must
be optimized. Indeed, if the entanglement generation rates are not optimized,
then some of these valuable resources will be discarded and lost. In this
paper, the problem of optimizing the entanglement generation rates and their
distribution over a quantum memory is studied. In particular, a quantum network
in which users have heterogeneous distances and applications is considered.
This problem is posed as a mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization
problem whose goal is to efficiently utilize the available quantum memory by
distributing the quantum entangled pairs in a way that maximizes the user
satisfaction. An interior point optimization method is used to solve the
optimization problem and extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed system. Simulation results show the key design
considerations for efficient quantum networks, and the effect of different
network parameters on the network performance.

digital cameras, though it is not widely known and usually not reported in

pixel's light sensitive area to its total theoretical area. It is generally
believed that the lower fill factor may reduce the accuracy of photogrammetric
measurements. But nevertheless, there are no studies addressing the effect of
the imaging sensor's fill factor on digital image correlation (DIC) measurement
accuracy. We report on research aiming to quantify the effect of fill factor on
DIC measurements accuracy in terms of displacement error and strain error. We
use rigid-body-translation experiments then numerically modify the recorded
images to synthesize three different types of images with 1/4 of the original
resolution. Each type of the synthesized images has different value of the fill
factor; namely 100%, 50% and 25%. By performing DIC analysis with the same
parameters on the three different types of synthesized images, the effect of
fill factor on measurement accuracy may be realized. Our results show that the
FPA's fill factor can have a significant effect on the accuracy of DIC
measurements. This effect is clearly dependent on the type and characteristics
of the speckle pattern. The fill factor has a clear effect on measurement error
for low contrast speckle patterns and for high contrast speckle patterns (black
dots on white background) with small dot size (3 pixels dot diameter). However,
when the dot size is large enough (about 7 pixels dot diameter), the fill

  Tracts","accepted by IPMI 2021",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved stateof-the-art
performance for white matter (WM) tract segmentation based on diffusion
magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). These CNNs require a large number of manual
delineations of the WM tracts of interest for training, which are generally
labor-intensive and costly. The expensive manual delineation can be a
particular disadvantage when novel WM tracts, i.e., tracts that have not been
included in existing manual delineations, are to be analyzed. To accurately
segment novel WM tracts, it is desirable to transfer the knowledge learned
about existing WM tracts, so that even with only a few delineations of the
novel WM tracts, CNNs can learn adequately for the segmentation. In this paper,
we explore the transfer of such knowledge to the segmentation of novel WM
tracts in the few-shot setting. Although a classic fine-tuning strategy can be
used for the purpose, the information in the last task-specific layer for
segmenting existing WM tracts is completely discarded. We hypothesize that the
weights of this last layer can bear valuable information for segmenting the
novel WM tracts and thus completely discarding the information is not optimal.
In particular, we assume that the novel WM tracts can correlate with existing
WM tracts and the segmentation of novel WM tracts can be predicted with the
logits of existing WM tracts. In this way, better initialization of the last
layer than random initialization can be achieved for fine-tuning. Further, we
show that a more adaptive use of the knowledge in the last layer for segmenting
existing WM tracts can be conveniently achieved by simply inserting a warmup
stage before classic fine-tuning. The proposed method was evaluated on a
publicly available dMRI dataset, where we demonstrate the benefit of our method
for few-shot segmentation of novel WM tracts.

spectrum ranging from $10^{-2}$ to $10 \, M_{\odot}$ (Solar mass) and contains
a massive central black hole of the mass $M_{\bullet} = 10^3 \, M_{\odot}$ is
considered. It is shown that in the process of the evolution of cluster, the
merger rate changed significantly, and by now, the PBH clusters have passed the
stage of active merging of the black holes inside~them.

transmission rate $\beta$) of an SEIR model is to use grid search, where
simulations are performed on each set of parameters, and the parameter set
leading to the least $L_2$ distance between predicted number of infections and
observed infections is selected. This brute-force strategy is not only time
consuming, as simulations are slow when the population is large, but also
inaccurate, since it is impossible to enumerate all parameter combinations. To
address these issues, in this paper, we propose to transform the
non-differentiable problem of finding optimal $\Theta_\text{SEIR}$ to a
differentiable one, where we first train a recurrent net to fit a small number
of simulation data. Next, based on this recurrent net that is able to
generalize SEIR simulations, we are able to transform the objective to a
differentiable one with respect to $\Theta_\text{SEIR}$, and straightforwardly
obtain its optimal value. The proposed strategy is both time efficient as it
only relies on a small number of SEIR simulations, and accurate as we are able
to find the optimal $\Theta_\text{SEIR}$ based on the differentiable objective.
On two COVID-19 datasets, we observe that the proposed strategy leads to
significantly better parameter estimations with a smaller number of
simulations.

learning rate schedule of the optimizer. The choice of learning rate schedule
determines the computational cost of getting close to a minima, how close you

(wide/narrow) attained. The kind of minima attained has a significant impact on
the generalization accuracy of the network. Current systems employ hand tuned
learning rate schedules, which are painstakingly tuned for each network and
dataset. Given that the state space of schedules is huge, finding a
satisfactory learning rate schedule can be very time consuming. In this paper,
we present LRTuner, a method for tuning the learning rate as training proceeds.
Our method works with any optimizer, and we demonstrate results on SGD with

  We extensively evaluate LRTuner on multiple datasets, models, and across

the given dataset and models, including ImageNet on Resnet-50, Cifar-10 on

\citep{khandelwal2020nearest} has proved to introduce significant performance
boosts over standard neural MT systems, it is prohibitively slow since it uses
the entire reference corpus as the datastore for the nearest neighbor search.
This means each step for each beam in the beam search has to search over the
entire reference corpus. $k$NN-MT is thus two-orders slower than vanilla MT
models, making it hard to be applied to real-world applications, especially
online services. In this work, we propose Fast $k$NN-MT to address this issue.
Fast $k$NN-MT constructs a significantly smaller datastore for the nearest
neighbor search: for each word in a source sentence, Fast $k$NN-MT first
selects its nearest token-level neighbors, which is limited to tokens that are
the same as the query token. Then at each decoding step, in contrast to using
the entire corpus as the datastore, the search space is limited to target
tokens corresponding to the previously selected reference source tokens. This
strategy avoids search through the whole datastore for nearest neighbors and
drastically improves decoding efficiency. Without loss of performance, Fast
$k$NN-MT is two-orders faster than $k$NN-MT, and is only two times slower than
the standard NMT model. Fast $k$NN-MT enables the practical use of $k$NN-MT

invariant representation for achieving good empirical performance. In this
paper, we reveal that merely learning invariant representation is vulnerable to

control the unseen test environment error in the representation learning, which
highlights the importance of controlling the smoothness of representation. In
practice, our analysis further inspires an efficient regularization method to
improve the robustness in domain generalization. Our regularization is

fluid-structure interaction (FSI) that uses an Eulerian description of the
momentum, viscosity, and incompressibility of a coupled fluid-structure system
and a Lagrangian description of the deformations, stresses, and resultant
forces of the immersed structure. Integral transforms with Dirac delta function
kernels couple the Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, and in practice,
discretizations of these integral transforms use regularized delta function
kernels. Many different kernel functions have been proposed, but prior
numerical work investigating the impact of the choice of kernel function on the
accuracy of the methodology has been limited. This work systematically studies
the effect of the choice of regularized delta function in several FSI benchmark
tests using the immersed finite element/difference (IFED) method, which is an
extension of the IB method that uses a finite element structural
discretizations combined with a Cartesian grid finite difference method for the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The IFED formulation evaluates the
regularized delta function on a collection of interaction points that can be
chosen to be denser than the nodes of the Lagrangian mesh, and this study
investigates the effect of varying the relative mesh widths of the Lagrangian
and Eulerian discretizations. Our results indicate that kernels satisfying a
commonly imposed even-odd condition require higher resolution to achieve
similar accuracy as kernels that do not satisfy. We also find that narrower
kernels are more robust and that structural meshes that are substantially
coarser than the Cartesian grid can yield high accuracy for shear-dominated
cases but not for cases with large normal forces. We verify our results in a
large-scale FSI model of a bovine pericardial bioprosthetic heart valve in a

Massive stars form in magnetized and turbulent
environments, and are often located in stellar clusters. Their accretion
mechanism, as well as the origin of their system's stellar multiplicity are
poorly understood. Aims. We study the influence of both magnetic fields and
turbulence on the accretion mechanism of massive protostars and their
multiplicity. Methods. We present a series of four Radiation-MHD simulations of
the collapse of a massive magnetized, turbulent core of 100 $M_\odot$ with the
AMR code Ramses, including a hybrid radiative transfer method for stellar
irradiation and ambipolar diffusion. We vary the Mach and Alfvenic Mach numbers
to probe sub- and superalfvenic turbulence as well as sub- and supersonic
turbulence regimes. Results. Subalfvenic turbulence leads to single stellar
systems while superalfvenic turbulence leads to binary formation from disk
fragmentation following spiral arm collision, with mass ratios of 1.1-1.6. In
those runs, infalling gas reaches the individual disks via a transient
circumbinary structure. Magnetically-regulated, thermally-dominated (plasma
beta $\beta>1$), Keplerian disks form in all runs, with sizes 100-200 AU and
masses 1-8 $M_\odot$. The disks around primary and secondary sink particles
share similar properties. We observe higher accretion rates onto the secondary
stars than onto their primary star companion. The primary disk orientation is
found to be set by the initial angular momentum carried by turbulence.
Conclusions. Small (300 AU) massive protostellar disks as those frequently
observed nowadays can only be reproduced so far in the presence of (moderate)
magnetic fields with ambipolar diffusion, even in a turbulent medium. The
interplay between magnetic fields and turbulence sets the multiplicity of
stellar clusters. A plasma beta $\beta>1$ is a good indicator of streamers and
disks.

by employing exist approaches directly. To this end, we propose a joint
optimization framework to solve this problem. Particularly, we reformulate it
as an equivalent form by employing the Lagrangian dual transform and the
fractional programming transform, and decompose the transformed problem into
several sub-problems. Then, we propose an alternate optimization algorithm by
capitalizing on the dual sub-gradient method, the successive convex
approximation method, and the penalty-based majorization-minimization approach,
to solve the sub-problems iteratively, and obtain the optimal solutions in
nearly closed-forms. Numerical simulation results verify the effectiveness of
the IRS in SWIPT system and indicate that the proposed algorithm offers a
substantial performance gain.

service providers since a high-quality image can significantly improve the
user's quality of experience (QoE) and also benefit lots of computer vision
algorithms. Most existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models were
developed for synthetically distorted images, however, they perform poorly on
in-the-wild images, which are widely existed in various practical applications.
In this paper, we propose a novel BIQA model for in-the-wild images by
addressing two critical problems in this field: how to learn better
quality-aware feature representation, and how to solve the problem of
insufficient training samples in terms of their content and distortion
diversity. Considering that perceptual visual quality is affected by both
low-level visual features (e.g. distortions) and high-level semantic
information (e.g. content), we first propose a staircase structure to
hierarchically integrate the features from intermediate layers into the final
feature representation, which enables the model to make full use of visual
information from low-level to high-level. Then an iterative mixed database
training (IMDT) strategy is proposed to train the BIQA model on multiple
databases simultaneously, so the model can benefit from the increase in both
training samples and image content and distortion diversity and can learn a
more general feature representation. Experimental results show that the
proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art BIQA models on six
in-the-wild IQA databases by a large margin. Moreover, the proposed model shows
an excellent performance in the cross-database evaluation experiments, which
further demonstrates that the learned feature representation is robust to
images with diverse distortions and content. The code is available at

due to the advantage of network embedding in various fields and the dynamic
nature of many real-world networks. An input dynamic network to DNE is often
assumed to have smooth changes over snapshots, which however would not hold for
all real-world scenarios. It is natural to ask if existing DNE methods can
perform well for an input dynamic network without smooth changes. To quantify
it, an index called Degree of Changes (DoCs) is suggested so that the smaller
DoCs indicates the smoother changes. Our comparative study shows several DNE
methods are not robust enough to different DoCs even if the corresponding input
dynamic networks come from the same dataset, which would make these methods
unreliable and hard to use for unknown real-world applications. To propose an
effective and more robust DNE method, we follow the notion of ensembles where
each base learner adopts an incremental Skip-Gram embedding model. To further
boost the performance, a simple yet effective strategy is designed to enhance
the diversity among base learners at each timestep by capturing different
levels of local-global topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior

with limited budgets. Active learning gives a procedure to select the most
informative data points and improve data efficiency by reducing the cost of
labeling. The info-max learning principle maximizing mutual information such as
BALD has been successful and widely adapted in various active learning
applications. However, this pool-based specific objective inherently introduces
a redundant selection and further requires a high computational cost for batch
selection. In this paper, we design and propose a new uncertainty measure,
Balanced Entropy Acquisition (BalEntAcq), which captures the information
balance between the uncertainty of underlying softmax probability and the label
variable. To do this, we approximate each marginal distribution by Beta
distribution. Beta approximation enables us to formulate BalEntAcq as a ratio
between an augmented entropy and the marginalized joint entropy. The
closed-form expression of BalEntAcq facilitates parallelization by estimating
two parameters in each marginal Beta distribution. BalEntAcq is a purely
standalone measure without requiring any relational computations with other
data points. Nevertheless, BalEntAcq captures a well-diversified selection near
the decision boundary with a margin, unlike other existing uncertainty measures
such as BALD, Entropy, or Mean Standard Deviation (MeanSD). Finally, we
demonstrate that our balanced entropy learning principle with BalEntAcq

especially, the local Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (symmetric off-diagonal)
interaction can create vortices most efficiently in the (anti)ferromagnetic
Kitaev model, as it effectively flips the sign of the Kitaev interaction. We
test this idea by performing the {\it ab initio} calculation for a candidate
material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ through the manipulation of the ligand positions
that breaks the inversion symmetry and induces the local Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction. We also demonstrate a braiding of vortices by adiabatically and

security patches remain beyond public exposure, e.g., in the open-source
libraries that are heavily relied on by developers. An extensive security
patches dataset could help end-users such as security companies, e.g., building
a security knowledge base, or researchers, e.g., aiding in vulnerability
research. To curate security patches including undisclosed patches at a large
scale and low cost, we propose a deep neural-network-based approach built upon
commits of open-source repositories. We build security patch datasets that
include 38,291 security-related commits and 1,045 CVE patches from four C
libraries. We manually verify each commit, among the 38,291 security-related
commits, to determine if they are security-related. We devise a deep
learning-based security patch identification system that consists of two neural
networks: one commit-message neural network that utilizes pretrained word
representations learned from our commits dataset; and one code-revision neural
network that takes code before and after revision and learns the distinction on
the statement level. Our evaluation results show that our system outperforms
SVM and K-fold stacking algorithm, achieving as high as 87.93% F1-score and
precision of 86.24%. We deployed our pipeline and learned model in an
industrial production environment to evaluate the generalization ability of our
approach. The industrial dataset consists of 298,917 commits from 410 new

To address this critical issue, we take long-range dependencies of input images

StyTr$^2$ contains two different transformer encoders to generate

the developments in quantum computing to explore large complex machine learning

centralized solutions that cannot scale well for large-scale and distributed
quantum networks. Hence, it is apropos to consider more practical quantum
federated learning (QFL) solutions tailored towards emerging quantum network
architectures. Indeed, developing QFL frameworks for quantum networks is
critical given the fragile nature of computing qubits and the difficulty of
transferring them. On top of its practical momentousness, QFL allows for
distributed quantum learning by leveraging existing wireless communication
infrastructure. This paper proposes the first fully quantum federated learning
framework that can operate over quantum data and, thus, share the learning of
quantum circuit parameters in a decentralized manner. First, given the lack of
existing quantum federated datasets in the literature, the proposed framework
begins by generating the first quantum federated dataset, with a hierarchical
data format, for distributed quantum networks. Then, clients sharing QCNN
models are fed with the quantum data to perform a classification task.
Subsequently, the server aggregates the learnable quantum circuit parameters
from clients and performs federated averaging. Extensive experiments are
conducted to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed QFL
solution. This work is the first to combine Google's TensorFlow Federated and
TensorFlow Quantum in a practical implementation.

application of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Compression methods are often
applied on the massive amounts of sensor data generated prior to sending it to
the Cloud to reduce the storage and delivery costs. A lossy compression
provides high compression gain (CG), but may reduce the performance of an ECG
application (downstream task) due to information loss. Previous works on ECG
monitoring focus either on optimizing the signal reconstruction or the task's
performance. Instead, we advocate a self-adapting lossy compression solution
that enables configuring a desired performance level on the downstream tasks
while maintaining an optimized CG that reduces Cloud costs. We propose
Dynamic-Deep, a task-aware compression geared for IoT-Cloud architectures. Our
compressor is trained to optimize the CG while maintaining the performance
requirement of the downstream tasks chosen out of a wide range. In deployment,
the IoT edge device adapts the compression and sends an optimized
representation for each data segment, accounting for the downstream task's
desired performance without relying on feedback from the Cloud. We conduct an
extensive evaluation of our approach on common ECG datasets using two popular
ECG applications, which includes heart rate (HR) arrhythmia classification. We
demonstrate that Dynamic-Deep can be configured to improve HR classification
F1-score in a wide range of requirements. One of which is tuned to improve the
F1-score by 3 and increases CG by up to 83% compared to the previous
state-of-the-art (autoencoder-based) compressor. Analyzing Dynamic-Deep on the
Google Cloud Platform, we observe a 97% reduction in cloud costs compared to a
no compression solution.

considered as one of the best physiological signals to detect drivers drowsy
states, since it directly measures neurophysiological activities in the brain.
However, designing a calibration-free system for driver drowsiness detection
with EEG is still a challenging task, as EEG suffers from serious mental and
physical drifts across different subjects. In this paper, we propose a compact
and interpretable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to discover shared EEG
features across different subjects for driver drowsiness detection. We
incorporate the Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer in the model structure,
allowing the Class Activation Map (CAM) method to be used for localizing
regions of the input signal that contribute most for classification. Results
show that the proposed model can achieve an average accuracy of 73.22% on 11
subjects for 2-class cross-subject EEG signal classification, which is higher
than conventional machine learning methods and other state-of-art deep learning
methods. It is revealed by the visualization technique that the model has
learned biologically explainable features, e.g., Alpha spindles and Theta
burst, as evidence for the drowsy state. It is also interesting to see that the
model uses artifacts that usually dominate the wakeful EEG, e.g., muscle
artifacts and sensor drifts, to recognize the alert state. The proposed model
illustrates a potential direction to use CNN models as a powerful tool to
discover shared features related to different mental states across different
subjects from EEG signals.

that ultraviolet radiation's effect might be a significant factor moderating
the spread of the COVID-19 across countries. Regression analysis was done for
the UV radiation data for seven hotspot cities (New Delhi, Mumbai, Milan,
Madrid, New York, Melbourne and Sydney) with the daily COVID-19 cases. Global
erythemal UV radiation values were lower during winter and higher during
summer. In general, the daily new COVID-19 cases registered were higher during
the winter months having low UV radiation dose (0.5-3.7 kJ m-2). Cases began to

this work, we design an edge-assisted framework called Xihe to provide mobile
AR applications the ability to obtain accurate omnidirectional lighting
estimation in real time. Specifically, we develop a novel sampling technique
that efficiently compresses the raw point cloud input generated at the mobile
device. This technique is derived based on our empirical analysis of a recent

results show that Xihe takes as fast as 20.67ms per lighting estimation and
achieves 9.4% better estimation accuracy than a state-of-the-art neural

  To achieve this, we introduce \emph{Tournesol}, an open source platform
available at \url{https://tournesol.app}. Tournesol aims to collect a large
database of human judgments on what algorithms ought to widely recommend (and
what they ought to stop widely recommending). We outline the structure of the
Tournesol database, the key features of the Tournesol platform and the main
hurdles that must be overcome to make it a successful project. Most
importantly, we argue that, if successful, Tournesol may then serve as the
essential foundation for any safe and ethical large-scale algorithm.

recognition, it is still challenging to design a calibration-free system, since
EEG signals vary significantly among different subjects and recording sessions.
Many efforts have been made to use deep learning methods for mental state
recognition from EEG signals. However, existing work mostly treats deep
learning models as black-box classifiers, while what have been learned by the
models and to which extent they are affected by the noise in EEG data are still
underexplored. In this paper, we develop a novel convolutional neural network
combined with an interpretation technique that allows sample-wise analysis of
important features for classification. The network has a compact structure and
takes advantage of separable convolutions to process the EEG signals in a
spatial-temporal sequence. Results show that the model achieves an average
accuracy of 78.35% on 11 subjects for leave-one-out cross-subject drowsiness
recognition, which is higher than the conventional baseline methods of
53.40%-72.68% and state-of-the-art deep learning methods of 71.75%-75.19%.
Interpretation results indicate the model has learned to recognize biologically
meaningful features from EEG signals, e.g., Alpha spindles, as strong
indicators of drowsiness across different subjects. In addition, we also
explore reasons behind some wrongly classified samples with the interpretation
technique and discuss potential ways to improve the recognition accuracy. Our
work illustrates a promising direction on using interpretable deep learning
models to discover meaningful patterns related to different mental states from
complex EEG signals.
