(i.e. pressure) the density should be larger than or equal to the one
corresponding to a homogeneous, adiabatic stratification throughout the planet
(referred to as the 'outer adiabat'). The observations of Jupiter's gravity
field by Juno combined with the constraints on its atmospheric composition
appear to be incompatible with such a profile. In this letter, we show that the
above assumption stems from an incorrect understanding of the
Schwarzschild-Ledoux criterion, which is only valid on a local scale. In order
to fulfil the buoyancy stability condition, the density gradient with pressure
in a non-adiabatic region must indeed rise more steeply than the {\it local}
adiabatic density gradient. However, the density gradient can be smaller than
the one corresponding to the outer adiabat at the same pressure because of the
higher temperature in an inhomogeneously stratified medium. Deep enough, the
density can therefore be lower than the one corresponding to the outer adiabat.
We show that this is permitted only if the slope of the local adiabat becomes
shallower than the slope of the outer adiabat at the same pressure, as found in
recent Jupiter models due to the increase of both specific entropy and
adiabatic index with depth. We examine the dynamical stability of this
structure and show that it is stable against non-adiabatic perturbations. The
possibility of such unconventional density profile in Jupiter complicates
further our understanding of the internal structure and evolution of
(extrasolar) giant planets.

  Cryptography for Networks, SCN 2018",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the setting of secure multiparty computation (MPC), a set of mutually
distrusting parties wish to jointly compute a function, while guaranteeing the
privacy of their inputs and the correctness of the output. An MPC protocol is
called \emph{fully secure} if no adversary can prevent the honest parties from
obtaining their outputs. A protocol is called \emph{fair} if an adversary can
prematurely abort the computation, however, only before learning any new
information.
  We present highly efficient transformations from fair computations to fully
secure computations, assuming the fraction of honest parties is constant (e.g.,
$1\%$ of the parties are honest). Compared to previous transformations that
require linear invocations (in the number of parties) of the fair computation,
our transformations require super-logarithmic, and sometimes even
super-constant, such invocations. The main idea is to delegate the computation
to chosen random committees that invoke the fair computation. Apart from the
benefit of uplifting security, the reduction in the number of parties is also
useful, since only committee members are required to work, whereas the
remaining parties simply ""listen"" to the computation over a broadcast channel.

boundary value problem is implemented in finite element simulations describing
the scattering of a square metamaterial's sample whose side counts 9 unit

relaxed micromorphic model can recover the scattering metamaterial's behavior
for a wide range of frequencies and for all possible angles of incidence, thus
showing that it is suitable to describe dynamic anisotropy. Finally, thanks to
the model's computational performances, we can design a metastructure combining
metamaterials and classical materials in such a way that it acts as a
protection device while providing energy focusing in specific collection
points. These results open important perspectives for the short-term design of
sustainable structures that can control elastic waves and recover energy.

controllability (PTSC) to study the generic property of controllability
preservation for a structured linear system under structured perturbations.
More precisely, a structured system is said to be PTSC with respect to a given
perturbation structure, if for almost all of its controllable realizations,
there are no addable complex-valued perturbations with their zero/nonzero
patterns prescribed by the perturbation structure that can make the resulting
system uncontrollable. We prove that genericity exists in this notion in the
sense that, for almost all controllable realizations of a structured system,
either there exist such addable structured perturbations rendering the
resulting systems uncontrollable, or there is not such a perturbation. We give
a decomposition-based necessary and sufficient condition for a single-input
linear system to ensure PTSC, whose verification has polynomial time
complexity. We then present some intuitive graph-theoretic conditions for PTSC.
As an application, our results can serve as some feasibility conditions for the
conventional structured controllability radius problems from a generic view.

result, the observed flat radial profile of the CN line intensities is
reproduced due to a high dust-to-gas surface density ratio inside ~20 au.
Meanwhile, the CO isotopologue line intensities trace high temperature gas and
increase rapidly inside a disk radius of ~30 au. A model with either CO gas
depletion or depletion of gas-phase oxygen elemental abundance is required to
reproduce the relatively weak CO isotopologue line intensities observed in the

microscopy reveals exclusively N\'eel type domain walls and, with a

formation of achiral Bloch ($Q=1$) and type II bubbles ($Q=0$) at increased
perpendicular field. Combined with the reduced anisotropy leading to greater
bubble densities, the latter case makes for an excellent test bed to examine
the benefits of topological charge on stability. Simultaneous observation of

more sensitive instrumentation have dramatically improved our knowledge of the
more violent physical processes taking place in galactic and extra-galactic
Black-Holes, Neutron Stars, Supernova Remnants/Pulsar Wind Nebulae, and other
regions of the Universe where relativistic acceleration processes are in place.
Simultaneous and/or combined observations with gamma-ray satellites and ground
based high-energy telescopes, have clarified the scenario of the mechanisms
responsible for high energy photon emission by leptonic and hadronic
accelerated particles in the presence of magnetic fields. Specifically, the
European Space Agency INTEGRAL soft gamma-ray observatory has detected more
than 1000 sources in the soft gamma-ray band, providing accurate positions,
light curves and time resolved spectral data for them. Space observations with
Fermi-LAT and observations that were carried out from the ground with H.E.S.S.,
MAGIC, VERITAS, and other telescopes sensitive in the GeV-TeV domain have, at
the same time, provided evidence that a substantial fraction of the cosmic
sources detected are emitting in the keV to TeV band via Synchrotron-Inverse
Compton processes, in particular from stellar galactic BH systems as well as
from distant black holes. In this work, employing a spatial cross correlation
technique, we compare the INTEGRAL/IBIS and TeV all-sky data in search of
secure or likely associations. Although this analysis is based on a subset of
the INTEGRAL all-sky observations, we find that there is a significant
correlation: 39 objects show emission in both soft gamma-ray and TeV wavebands.
The full INTEGRAL database, now comprising almost 19 years of public data
available, will represent an important legacy that will be useful for the
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and other ground based large projects.

automaton equipped with integer weights. We consider optimal reachability
objectives, in which one of the players, that we call Min, wants to reach a
target location while minimising the cumulated weight. While knowing if Min has
a strategy to guarantee a value lower than a given threshold is known to be
undecidable (with two or more clocks), several conditions, one of them being
the divergence, have been given to recover decidability. In such weighted timed
games (like in untimed weighted games in the presence of negative weights), Min
may need finite memory to play (close to) optimally. This is thus tempting to
try to emulate this finite memory with other strategic capabilities. In this
work, we allow the players to use stochastic decisions, both in the choice of
transitions and of timing delays. We give for the first time a definition of
the expected value in weighted timed games, overcoming several theoretical
challenges. We then show that, in divergent weighted timed games, the
stochastic value is indeed equal to the classical (deterministic) value, thus
proving that Min can guarantee the same value while only using stochastic
choices, and no memory.

photoanodes is essential for the rational design of high-efficiency
functionalizations. Recently it was found that interface modification with
Sn/Sb segregates considerably increases hematite photocatalytic efficiency.
However, the understanding of the different electronic effects of these
modifications at the atomic level is still lacking. This letter describes the
segregation effects of two different dopants-Sn and Sb-on both the solid-solid
(grain-boundaries) and solid-liquid interfaces (surfaces) of hematite. Within
an ab-initio approach, we quantitatively extract the potential barrier
reduction on polycrystalline interfaces due to the dopant, which causes an
increase in the inter-grain electron transport. Concomitantly, the dopants'
segregation on hematite surfaces results in a decrease of the oxygen vacancy
formation energy. Such vacancies lead to the experimentally observed rise of
the flat-band potential. The comprehension of the electronic effects of dopants
on both types of interfaces explains the experimental peak efficiency of
interface-modified hematite with dopant segregates, also enabling the control
and design of interfaces for different higher-efficiency applications.

rate in theory. Our method benefits from a one-sided interpolatory model order

optical fiber scales as $R \sim e^{-\alpha L}$, where $\alpha$ is the fiber's
loss coefficient. The rate achieved using a linear chain of quantum repeaters
equipped with quantum memories, probabilistic Bell state measurements (BSMs)
and switches used for spatial multiplexing, but no quantum error correction,
was shown to surpass the direct-transmission capacity. However, this rate still
decays exponentially with the end-to-end distance, viz., $R \sim e^{-s{\alpha
L}}$, with $s < 1$. We show that the introduction of temporal multiplexing -
i.e., the ability to perform BSMs among qubits at a repeater node that were
successfully entangled with qubits at distinct neighboring nodes at {\em
different} time steps - leads to a sub-exponential rate-vs.-distance scaling,
i.e., $R \sim e^{-t\sqrt{\alpha L}}$, which is not attainable with just spatial
or spectral multiplexing. We evaluate analytical upper and lower bounds to this
rate, and obtain the exact rate by numerically optimizing the time-multiplexing
block length and the number of repeater nodes. We further demonstrate that
incorporating losses in the optical switches used to implement time
multiplexing degrades the rate-vs.-distance performance, eventually falling
back to exponential scaling for very lossy switches. We also examine models for
quantum memory decoherence and describe optimal regimes of operation to
preserve the desired boost from temporal multiplexing. Quantum memory
decoherence is seen to be more detrimental to the repeater's performance over
switching losses.

combinatorial formula representing the connected correlators of multiply wound
Wilson loops in terms of the matrix model solution is derived. Two new results
are obtained on the expectation value of the circular Wilson loop, the
expansion of which into a series in $1/N$ and to all orders in the 't~Hooft

connected correlators of two multiply wound Wilson loops with arbitrary winding
numbers are calculated as a series in $1/N$. The coefficient functions are
derived not only as power series in $\lambda$, but also to all orders in
$\lambda$ by expressing them in terms of the coefficients of the Drukker and

To address this problem, we propose a new approach, Compositional Cosine Graph
Embeddings (Co-CGE), based on two principles. First, Co-CGE models the
dependency between states, objects and their compositions through a graph
convolutional neural network. The graph propagates information from seen to
unseen concepts, improving their representations. Second, since not all unseen
compositions are equally feasible, and less feasible ones may damage the
learned representations, Co-CGE estimates a feasibility score for each unseen
composition, using the scores as margins in a cosine similarity-based loss and
as weights in the adjacency matrix of the graphs. Experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in standard CZSL while
outperforming previous methods in the open world scenario.

It uses information on event-by-event individual parameters and their

weighted according to their likelihood of being a signal or a background event

radio observations ($\nu \lesssim 200$ MHz) of plasma and cyclotron emission
from stars probe these magneto-ionic conditions. Here we report the detection
of low-frequency ($120-167\,{\rm MHz}$) radio emission associated with the dMe6

closed field regions extends to at least $\approx 10$ stellar radii, that is
about a factor of a few larger than the solar value, and possibly to $\gtrsim
20$ stellar radii. Our results suggest that the magnetic-field structure of M
dwarfs is in between Sun-like and planet-like configurations, where compact
over-dense coronal loops with X-ray emitting plasma co-exist with a large-scale

The guiding insight is to design optimization routines for these networks that

The objective function for training is first based on the instantaneous
filtered velocity fields from a corresponding direct numerical simulation, and
the training is by a stochastic gradient descent method, which uses the adjoint
Navier--Stokes equations to provide the end-to-end sensitivities of the model
weights to the velocity fields. In-sample and out-of-sample testing on multiple
dual-jet configurations show that its required mesh density in each coordinate
direction for prediction of mean flow, Reynolds stresses, and spectra is half
that needed by the dynamic Smagorinsky model for comparable accuracy. The same
neural-network model trained directly to match filtered sub-grid-scale stresses
-- without the constraint of being embedded within the flow equations during
the training -- fails to provide a qualitatively correct prediction. The
coupled formulation is generalized to train based only on mean-flow and
Reynolds stresses, which are more readily available in experiments. The
mean-flow training provides a robust model, which is important, though a
somewhat less accurate prediction for the same coarse meshes, as might be
anticipated due to the reduced information available for training in this case.
The anticipated advantage of the formulation is that the inclusion of resolved
physics in the training increases its capacity to extrapolate. This is assessed
for the case of passive scalar transport, for which it outperforms established
models due to improved mixing predictions.

in fact, samples are always bounded in practice, namely because of clipping

methods for demand planning. These uncertainties stem from the disease
progression, government interventions, economy and consumer behavior. While

progression, a few have focused on consequent regulations and their impact on
individual behavior. The contributions of this paper include a quantitative
behavior model of fear of COVID-19, impact of government interventions on

demand for goods. It brings together multiple models for disease progression,
consumer behavior and demand estimation-thus bridging the gap between disease
progression and consumer demand. We use panel regression to understand the
drivers of demand during the pandemic and Bayesian inference to simplify the
regulation landscape that can help build scenarios for resilient demand
planning. We illustrate this resilient demand planning model using a specific
example of gas retailing. We find that demand is sensitive to fear of COVID-19:
as the number of COVID-19 cases increase over the previous week, the demand for
gas decreases -- though this dissipates over time. Further, government
regulations restrict access to different services, thereby reducing mobility,
which in itself reduces demand.

languages with a signature $\Sigma$ - comprising object types, relation types,

Three cases studies are included to show the effectiveness of the approach.
Applying the formalism to the next level in the hierarchy of models we create
M2FOL, a formal modeling language for metamodels. We show that M2FOL is
self-describing and therefore complete the formalization of the full four-layer
metamodeling stack. On the basis of our generic formalism applicable to
arbitrary modeling languages we examine three current research topics -
language interleaving & consistency, operations on models, and automatic

them with the proposed formalism. This shows that the rich knowledge stack on

testimonials and reviews to learn more about the quality of a new product.
However, it may be difficult for consumers to assess the precision of such
information. We use a monopoly setting to investigate how the precision of
third-party information and consumers' ability to recognize precision impact
firm profits. Conventional wisdom suggests that when a firm is high quality, it
should prefer a market where consumers are better at recognizing precise
signals. Yet in a broad range of conditions, we show that when the firm is high
quality, it is more profitable to sell to consumers who do not recognize
precise signals. Given the ability of consumers to assess precision, we show a
low quality firm always suffers from more precise information. However, a high
quality firm can also suffer from more precise information. The precision range
in which a high quality firm gains or suffers from better information depends
on how skilled consumers are at recognizing precision.

tensor of a multilinear dynamical system is orthogonally decomposable (odeco),
we can construct its explicit solution by exploiting tensor Z-eigenvalues and
Z-eigenvectors. Based on the form of the explicit solution, we illustrate that
the Z-eigenvalues of the dynamic tensor play a significant role in the
stability analysis, offering necessary and sufficient conditions. In addition,
by utilizing the upper bounds of Z-spectral radii, we are able to determine the

events, a service can tolerate a certain amount of degradation and therefore by
reducing the protection traffic in the network, better spectrum utilization
could be attained. Such concept has been widely studied in the traditional WDM
context and yet has been somehow faded due to the fact that fixed transmission
technologies allow small room for spectral improvement. This paper aims to
renew the interest in partial protection and re-adapt it to the context of
elastic optical networks. The evolutionary perspective we lay out in this paper
identifies a new route for achieving greater spectral efficiency in a pragmatic
way by simply differentiating the protection services for each demand rather
than the uniform treatment for all demands. In doing so, we present a new
research problem entitled, routing, modulation level, spectrum and protection
service assignment which is an extension of the well-established one, that is,
routing, modulation level, and spectrum assignment as the (partial) protection
service for each demand is taken into account and optimized. Three variants of
that problem reflecting shades of applying partial protection are covered in
details. Specifically, the first one considers the intuitive case as the
relative amount of protection traffic for each demand is given as the input to
the network planning process while the second one is dedicated to the special
case of enforcing the same figure of partial protection for all demands. More
interesting is brought in the third variant where given the service level
agreement for the total network traffic, we provide the optimal solution that
determine the protection service for each individual demand so as to minimize
the spectral occupancy.

  Model Uncertainty: A Stochastic Gradient Approach",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aerodynamic optimization is ubiquitous in the design of most engineering
systems interacting with fluids. A common approach is to optimize a performance
function defined by a choice of an aerodynamic model, e.g., turbulence RANS
model, and at nominal operating conditions. Practical experience indicates that
such a deterministic approach may result in considerably sub-optimal designs
when the adopted aerodynamic model does not lead to accurate flow predictions
or when the actual operating conditions differ from those considered in the
design. One approach to address this shortcoming is to consider an average or
robust design, wherein the statistical moments of the performance function,
given the uncertainty in the operating conditions and the aerodynamic model, is
optimized. However, when the number of uncertain inputs is large or the
performance function exhibits significant variability, an accurate evaluation
of these moments may require a large number of forward and/or adjoint solves,
at each iteration of a gradient-based scheme. This, in turn, renders the design
computationally expensive, if not infeasible. To tackle this difficulty, we
consider a variant of the stochastic gradient descent method where, in each
optimization iteration, a stochastic approximation of the objective,
constraints, and their gradients are generated. This is done via a small number
of forward/adjoint solves corresponding to random selections of the uncertain
parameters and aerodynamic model. The methodology is applied to the robust
optimization of the standard NACA-0012 subject to parametric and turbulence
model uncertainty. With a cost that is a small factor larger than that of the
deterministic approach, the stochastic gradient approach significantly improves
the performance (mean and variance) of the aerodynamic design for a wide range
of operating conditions and turbulence models.

a material to the existence of robust boundary states, is a hallmark of
topological insulators. However, in crystalline topological materials the
presence of boundary states in the insulating gap is not always necessary since
they can be hidden in the bulk energy bands, obscured by boundary artifacts of
non-topological origin, or, in the case of higher-order topology, they can be
gapped altogether. Crucially, in such systems the interplay between
symmetry-protected topology and the corresponding symmetry defects can provide
a variety of bulk probes to reveal their topological nature. For example, bulk
crystallographic defects, such as disclinations and dislocations, have been
shown to bind fractional charges and/or robust localized bound states in
insulators protected by crystalline symmetries. Recently, exotic defects of
translation symmetry called partial dislocations have been proposed as a probe
of higher-order topology. However, it is a herculean task to have experimental
control over the generation and probing of isolated defects in solid-state
systems; hence their use as a bulk probe of topology faces many challenges.
Instead, here we show that partial dislocation probes of higher-order topology
are ideally suited to the context of engineered materials. Indeed, we present
the first observations of partial-dislocation-induced topological modes in 2D
and 3D higher-order topological insulators built from circuit-based resonator
arrays. While rotational defects (disclinations) have previously been shown to
indicate higher-order topology, our work provides the first experimental
evidence that exotic translation defects (partial dislocations) are bulk
topological probes.

whose state matrix has no eigenvalues with positive real parts, a
communication-delay-related observer, which is used to construct the
controller, is designed for followers to estimate the leader's state
information. Second, by means of the output regulation theory, the results are
relaxed to the case that only the leader's state matrix eigenvalues have
non-positive real parts and, under these relaxed conditions, the controller is
redesigned. Both cases lead to a closed-loop error system of which the
stability is guaranteed via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with sufficient
conditions in terms of input-delay-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).
An extended LMI is proposed which, in conjunction with the rest of LMIs,
results in a solution with a larger upper bound on delays than what would be
feasible without it. It is highlighted that the integration of
communication-delay-related observer and input-delay-related LMI to construct a
fully distributed controller (which requires no global information) is scalable
to arbitrarily large networks. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is
demonstrated via illustrative numerical examples.

stable and accurate time propagation over long time scales has been observed in
the square-lattice Heisenberg model using the Restricted Boltzmann machine
architecture. However, achieving similar performance in other systems has
proven to be more challenging. In this article, we focus on the two-leg
Heisenberg ladder driven out of equilibrium by a pulsed excitation as a
benchmark system. We demonstrate that unmitigated noise is strongly amplified
by the nonlinear equations of motion for the network parameters, which causes
numerical instabilities in the time evolution. As a consequence, the achievable
accuracy of the simulated dynamics is a result of the interplay between network
expressiveness and measures required to remedy these instabilities. We show
that stability can be greatly improved by appropriate choice of regularization.
This is particularly useful as tuning of the regularization typically imposes
no additional computational cost. Inspired by machine learning practice, we
propose a validation-set based diagnostic tool to help determining optimal
regularization hyperparameters for t-VMC based propagation schemes. For our
benchmark, we show that stable and accurate time propagation can be achieved in
regimes of sufficiently regularized variational dynamics.

suppress the effective particle losses in the wire. Moreover, we investigate
the interplay between interactions and the impurity shape and find that,
differently from the coherent scatterer case, the impurity shape modifies the
scaling of the scattering probabilities close to the Fermi momentum. We show

representation learning algorithms that can learn not only from datasets but
also learn from environments. An agent in a natural environment will not
typically be fed curated data. Instead, it must explore its environment to
acquire the data it will learn from. We propose a framework, curious
representation learning (CRL), which jointly learns a reinforcement learning
policy and a visual representation model. The policy is trained to maximize the
error of the representation learner, and in doing so is incentivized to explore
its environment. At the same time, the learned representation becomes stronger
and stronger as the policy feeds it ever harder data to learn from. Our learned
representations enable promising transfer to downstream navigation tasks,
performing better than or comparably to ImageNet pretraining without using any

learned representations can obtain interpretable results on real images. Code

an effective technique to reduce computation overhead for deep neural networks

still thirsty for model capacity due to the demand for handling big data. Thus,
pruning a recommendation model at scale results in a smaller model capacity and
consequently lower accuracy. To reduce computation cost without sacrificing

While these objects spend lengthy periods of time at large heliocentric
distances, if their perihelia remain less than around 40 au, their dynamical
evolution is still largely coupled to Neptune's. Conversely, around a dozen
extreme TNOs with a > 250 au and detached perihelia seem to exist in a regime
where they are too distant to be affected by the giant planets, and too close
for their dynamics to be governed by external forces. Recent work suggests that
the apparent alignment of these orbits in physical space is a signature of
gravitational shepherding by a distant massive planet. In this paper, we
investigate the evolution of TNOs in each of Neptune's n:1 resonances between
the 3:1 and 14:1. We conclude that both resonant and non-resonant objects
beyond the 12:1 near ~157 au are removed rather efficiently via perturbations
from the hypothetical Planet Nine. Additionally, we uncover a population of

experience episodes of resonant interactions with both Neptune and Planet Nine.

result of linearly realized symmetries governing static (spin 0,1,2)

the scalar case, they arise from the (E)AdS isometries of a dimensionally
reduced black hole spacetime. Underlying the symmetries is a ladder structure
which can be used to construct the full tower of solutions, and derive their
general properties: (1) solutions that decay with radius spontaneously break
the symmetries, and must diverge at the horizon; (2) solutions regular at the
horizon respect the symmetries, and take the form of a finite polynomial that
grows with radius. Taken together, these two properties imply that static
response coefficients -- and in particular Love numbers -- vanish. Moreover,
property (1) is consistent with the absence of black holes with linear
(perturbative) hair. We also discuss the manifestation of these symmetries in
the effective point particle description of a black hole, showing explicitly
that for scalar probes the worldline couplings associated with a non-trivial
tidal response and scalar hair must vanish in order for the symmetries to be
preserved.

distinction between galaxy types, as opposed to smooth S\'ersic profiles. Then,
we train and classify the sequences with machine learning algorithms, designed
through the platform Modulos AutoML, and study how they optimize the
classification task. As a demonstration of this method, we use the second
public release of the Dark Energy Survey (DES DR2). We show that by applying it
to this sample we are able to successfully distinguish between early-type and
late-type galaxies, for images with signal-to-noise ratio greater then 300.
This yields an accuracy of $86\%$ for the early-type galaxies and $93\%$ for
the late-type galaxies, which is on par with most contemporary automated image
classification approaches. Our novel method allows for galaxy images to be
accurately classified and is faster than other approaches. Data dimensionality
reduction also implies a significant lowering in computational cost. In the
perspective of future data sets obtained with e.g. Euclid and the Vera Rubin

divide canonical and Belinfante-Rosenfeld total angular momentum operators into
different components and study their commutation relations, their role in
generation of rotations of quantum fields, and their action on states from the
physical sector of the theory. Then, we examine physical matrix elements of
operators having gauge-fixing-related contributions, illustrating problems that
one may encounter due to careless employment of the resolution of identity

gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets propagating in binary neutron star (BNS) merger
ejecta. Using the simulations, we first find that mixing between the jet and
cocoon, which is present in all types of jets, inhibits the formation of
subphotospheric collisionless shocks. However, we show that a mild
magnetization may lead to the formation of collisionless subshocks which allow
efficient proton acceleration. We consider shear acceleration and diffusive
shock acceleration at collimation shocks, internal shocks, shock breakout, and
external shocks, to provide the first self-consistent estimate for neutrino and
cosmic-ray (CR) signals from GRBs in BNS mergers. We find that short GRBs do
not produce detectable neutrino signals with current-day facilities. Shock
breakout yields $ \sim 10 $ PeV neutrinos at viewing angles $\sim20^\circ $,
independent of the jet magnetization. However, a neutrino signal from shock
breakout is well below detection limits of current detectors. Such a signal
would allow a coincident neutrino-$\gamma-$ray detection, providing a testable
prediction for shock breakout as a neutrino production site. Using the
numerical modeling that fits GW170817 afterglow emission, we find that blast
waves in BNS mergers can account for 5%-10% of the Galactic CR luminosity in
the PeV-EeV energy range. Based on these estimates, the observed level of CR
anisotropy places a constraint on the distance of the latest Galactic binary
neutron star merger to $\lesssim3$ kiloparsecs.

characteristic butterfly diagram of the MRI dynamo with saturated turbulence
for at least 100 orbits. On the contrary, traditional SPH simulations suffer
from runaway growth and develop unphysically large azimuthal fields, similar to
the results from a recent study with mesh-less methods. We investigated the
dependency of MRI turbulence on the numerical Prandtl number in SPH, focusing
on the unstratified, zero net-flux case. We found that turbulence can only be
sustained with a Prandtl number larger than $\sim$2.5, similar to the critical
values of physical Prandtl number found in grid-code simulations. However,
unlike grid-based codes, the numerical Prandtl number in SPH increases with
resolution, and for a fixed Prandtl number, the resulting magnetic energy and
stresses are independent of resolution. Mean-field analyses were performed on
all simulations, and the resulting transport coefficients indicate no
$\alpha$-effect in the unstratified cases, but an active $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo
and a diamagnetic pumping effect in the stratified medium, which are generally
in agreement with previous studies. There is no clear indication of a
shear-current dynamo in our simulation, which is likely to be responsible for a
weaker mean-field growth in the tall, unstratified, zero net-flux simulation.

representing a probable future state of the overall process. Such a forecast
helps to investigate the consequences of drift and emerging bottlenecks. Our
technique builds on a representation of event data as multiple time series,
each capturing the evolution of a behavioural aspect of the process model, such
that corresponding forecasting techniques can be applied. Our implementation
demonstrates the accuracy of our technique on real-world event log data.

with stellar age, leading to the possibility of using stellar atmospheric
abundances as stellar age indicators. These chemical clocks have been
calibrated with solar-twins, open clusters and red giants, but it remains to be
seen whether they can be effective at identifying coeval stars in a field
population that spans a broad parameter space (i.e., the promise of chemical
tagging). Since the components of wide binaries are known to be stars of common
origins, they constitute ideal laboratories for testing the usefulness of
chemical clocks for the age dating of field stars. We determined the abundances
of a new sample of 5 binaries and collected data for other 31 systems from the
literature in order to test the applicability of chemical clocks. We recover
the well known result that the components of wide binaries have more consistent
chemistry than that of random pairs. However, we also show for the first time
that abundance ratios designed as chemical clocks are even more consistent
among the components of wide binaries than their [X/Fe] ratios. Not only that,
but the special case of the pair HIP 34426/HIP 34407 may indicate that chemical
clocks are consistent for coeval stars even when the individual abundances are
not. If the assumption that chemical clocks are reliable age indicators is
correct, this would constitute first quantitative, statistically significant
evidence that the components of wide binaries in the Galactic field are indeed
coeval, validating a large body of published work that relies on that to be the
case. Moreover, our results provide strong evidence that chemical clocks indeed
carry important information about stellar birthplaces and chemical evolution,
and thus we propose that including them in chemical tagging efforts may
facilitate the identification of nowadays dissolved stellar groups.

both entanglement between spatial degrees of freedom as well as between
different fields of the boundary theory. Moreover, we resolve the contribution
to the entanglement entropy of strings with different winding numbers in the
bulk geometry. We then calculate this generalized entanglement measure in a
thermal state dual to the BTZ black hole in the setting of the D1/D5 system at

in this way is dual to the length of a geodesic with non-zero winding number.
Such geodesics probe the entire bulk geometry, including the entanglement
shadow up to the horizon in the one-sided black hole as well as the wormhole
growth in the case of a two-sided black hole for an arbitrarily long time.

the quantization of such systems are the identification of a clock degree of
freedom before quantization (deparametrization), and quantization on a
kinematical Hilbert space which is subject to constraints (Dirac quantization).
The usual canonical quantization in quantum field theory is analogous to
deparametrization. Here we introduce a frozen formalism and Dirac quantization
for a complex Klein-Gordon scalar field, and show that the resulting theory is
equivalent to usual canonical quantization. We then apply the formalism to the
group field theory formalism for quantum gravity, for which both
deparametrization and a ""timeless"" quantization have been proposed in past
work. We show how a frozen formalism for group field theory links between these
two existing approaches, and illustrate in particular the construction of
physical observables. We derive effective cosmological dynamics for group field
theory in the new formalism and compare these to previous work. The frozen
formalism could be extended to other approaches to quantum gravity that do not
use a preferred time parameter.

meteorites show a clear dichotomy suggesting an efficient separation of the
inner and outer solar system. Observations show that ring-like structures in
the distribution of mm-sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks are common. These
structures are often associated with drifting pebbles being trapped by local
pressure maxima in the gas disk. Similar structures may also have existed in
the sun's natal disk, which could naturally explain the meteorite/planetary
isotopic dichotomy. Here, we test the effects of a strong pressure bump in the
outer disk (e.g. $\sim$5~au) on the formation of the inner solar system. We
model dust coagulation and evolution, planetesimal formation, as well as
embryo's growth via planetesimal and pebble accretion. Our results show that
terrestrial embryos formed via planetesimal accretion rather than pebble
accretion. In our model, the radial drift of pebbles foster planetesimal
formation. However, once a pressure bump forms, pebbles in the inner disk are
lost via drift before they can be efficiently accreted by embryos growing at
$\gtrapprox$1~au. Embryos inside $\sim$0.5-1.0au grow relatively faster and can
accrete pebbles more efficiently. However, these same embryos grow to larger
masses so they should migrate inwards substantially, which is inconsistent with
the current solar system. Therefore, terrestrial planets most likely accreted
from giant impacts of Moon to roughly Mars-mass planetary embryos formed around
$\gtrapprox$1.0~au. Finally, our simulations produce a steep radial mass
distribution of planetesimals in the terrestrial region which is qualitatively
aligned with formation models suggesting that the asteroid belt was born
low-mass.

atmospheres. Irradiated ocean planets with such inflated hydrospheres have been
recently shown to be good candidates for matching the mass-radius distribution
of sub-Neptunes. Here we describe a model that computes a realistic structure
for water-rich planets by combining an interior model with an updated equation
of state (EoS) for water, and an atmospheric model that takes into account
radiative transfer. We find that the use of non appropriate EoSs can lead to
the overestimation of the planetary radius by up to $\sim$10\%, depending on
the planet size and composition. Our model has been applied to the GJ 9827
system as a test case and indicates Earth- or Venus-like interiors for planets
b and c, respectively. Planet d could be an irradiated ocean planet with a
water mass fraction of $\sim$$20\pm10\%$. We also provide fits for the
mass-radius relationships, allowing one to directly retrieve a wide range of
planetary compositions, without the requirement to run the model. Our
calculations finally suggest that highly irradiated planets lost their H/He

to either super-Earths or sub-Neptunes, depending on the water mass fraction.

higher-order term rewriting systems that takes type information into account.
Specifically, base-type terms are mapped to \emph{tuples} of natural numbers
and higher-order terms to functions between those tuples. Tuples may carry
information relevant to the type; for instance, a term of type $\mathsf{nat}$
may be associated to a pair $(\mathsf{cost}, \mathsf{size})$ representing its
evaluation cost and size. This class of interpretations results in a more
fine-grained notion of complexity than runtime or derivational complexity,
which makes it particularly useful to obtain complexity bounds for higher-order
rewriting systems. We show that rewriting systems compatible with tuple
interpretations admit finite bounds on derivation height. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how to mechanically construct tuple interpretations and how to
orient $\beta$ and $\eta$ reductions within our technique. Finally, we relate
our method to runtime complexity and prove that specific interpretation shapes
imply certain runtime complexity bounds.

the formation of Ir-Ir dimers at both ambient and low temperatures, similar to
the case of $\mathrm{Li_2IrO_3}$. At higher pressures, the structural evolution
dramatically depends on temperature. A large discontinuous reduction of the Ir
honeycomb interplanar distance is observed around 15 GPa at room temperature,
likely driven by a collapse of the O-Cu-O dumbbells. At 15 K, pressures beyond
20 GPa first lead to an intermediate phase featuring a continuous reduction of
the interplanar distance, which then collapses at 30 GPa across yet another
phase transition. However, the resulting structure around 40 GPa is not the
same at room and low temperatures. Remarkably, the reduction in interplanar
distance leads to an apparent healing of the stacking faults at room

understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of check-ins and check-outs is
key for station balancing and bike relocation initiatives. Still, recent
contributions from deep learning and distance-based predictors show limited
success on forecasting bike sharing demand. This consistent observation is
hypothesized to be driven by: i) the strong dependence between demand and the

the relation between this novel entropy and semi-classical entropy in the
context of doubly-holographic models. Double holography allows for two
different $d$-dimensional descriptions of a black hole coupled to a

Neumann entropy in bath subregions. We argue that the correct homology
constraint for Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces depends on which of those
$d$-dimensional perspectives is taken. As a consequence the von Neumann
entropies of a fixed subregion in both descriptions can disagree. We discuss
how the von Neumann entropies in both descriptions are related to the entropy
computed by the island formula and coarse grained entropy. Moreover, we argue
that the way operators transform between the two descriptions depends on their
complexity. A simple toy model is introduced to demonstrate that a sufficiently

which both the nonequilibrium dissipative particle production and the sound
speed parameter slow the motion of the inflaton field. We find that a low sound
speed parameter removes, or at least strongly suppresses, the growing function
appearing in the scalar of curvature power spectrum of warm inflation, which
appears due to the temperature dependence in the dissipation coefficient. As a
consequence of that, a low sound speed helps to push warm inflation into the
strong dissipation regime, which is an attractive regime from a model building
and phenomenological perspective. In turn, the strong dissipation regime of
warm inflation softens the microscopic theoretical constraints on cold DBI
inflation. The present findings, along with the recent results from swampland
criteria, give a strong hint that warm inflation may consistently be embedded
into string theory.

sensitivity to parity ($P$) and time-reversal ($T$)-violating phenomena, such

Tremor (ET), and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Clinicians or
trained raters assess tremor severity with TETRAS scores by observing patients.
Lacking quantitative measures, inter- or intra- observer variabilities are
almost inevitable as the distinction between adjacent tremor scores is subtle.
Moreover, clinician assessments also require patient visits, which limits the
frequency of disease progress evaluation. Therefore it is beneficial to develop
an automated assessment that can be performed remotely and repeatably at
patients' convenience for continuous monitoring. In this work, we proposed to
train a deep neural network (DNN) with rank-consistent ordinal regression using
276 clinical videos from 36 essential tremor patients. The videos are coupled
with clinician assessed TETRAS scores, which are used as ground truth labels to
train the DNN. To tackle the challenge of limited training data, optical flows
are used to eliminate irrelevant background and statistic objects from RGB
frames. In addition to optical flows, transfer learning is also applied to
leverage pre-trained network weights from a related task of tremor frequency
estimate. The approach was evaluated by splitting the clinical videos into
training (67%) and testing sets (0.33%). The mean absolute error on TETRAS
score of the testing results is 0.45, indicating that most of the errors were
from the mismatch of adjacent labels, which is expected and acceptable. The
model predications also agree well with clinical ratings. This model is further
applied to smart phone videos collected from a PD patient who has an implanted
device to turn ""On"" or ""Off"" tremor. The model outputs were consistent with the
patient tremor states. The results demonstrate that our trained model can be
used as a means to assess and track tremor severity.

tradeoffs between economic and health-related outcomes during the COVID-19
pandemic. Despite evidence of the effectiveness of government-mandated
restrictions mitigating the spread of contagion, these orders are stigmatized
due to undesirable economic consequences. This tradeoff resulted in state
governments employing mandates in widely different ways. We compare the
different policies states implemented during periods of restriction (lockdown)
and reopening with indicators of COVID-19 spread and consumer card spending at
each state during the first wave of the pandemic in the U.S. between March and
August 2020. We find that while some states enacted reopening decisions when
the incidence rate of COVID-19 was minimal or sustained in its relative
decline, other states relaxed socioeconomic restrictions near their highest
incidence and prevalence rates experienced so far. Nevertheless, all states
experienced similar trends in consumer card spending recovery, which was
strongly correlated with reopening policies following the lockdowns and
relatively independent from COVID-19 incidence rates at the time. Our findings
suggest that consumer card spending patterns can be attributed to government
mandates rather than COVID-19 incidence in the states. We estimate the recovery
in states that reopened in late April was more than the recovery in states that
did not reopen in the same period - 15% for consumer card spending and 18% for
spending by high income households. This result highlights the important role
of state policies in minimizing health impacts while promoting economic
recovery and helps planning effective interventions in subsequent waves and

its $X$-distance $d_x$. The topological quantum codes form an important class
of quantum codes, where the toric code, introduced by Kitaev, was the first
family of this type. After Kitaev's toric code, several authors focused
attention on investigating its structure and the constructions of new families
of topological quantum codes over Euclidean and hyperbolic surfaces. As a
consequence of establishing the existence and the construction of asymmetric
topological quantum codes in Theorem \ref{main}, the main result of this paper,
we introduce the class of hyperbolic asymmetric codes. Hence, families of

analysis regarding the asymptotic behavior of their distances $d_x$ and $d_z$

analytical solutions to demonstrate that many of the findings from
non-relativistic weak turbulence are retained in the relativistic system. But,
an important distinction in the relativistic limit is the inapplicability of a
formally incompressible limit, i.e, there exists finite coupling to the
compressible fast mode regardless of the strength of the magnetic field. Since
fast modes can propagate across field lines, this mechanism provides a route
for energy to escape strongly magnetized systems, e.g., magnetar

ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians. The technologies involved in
these algorithms must be precise and reliable, regardless of environment

environments in situations where cameras cannot capture scenes properly. Some
approaches aim to compensate for these limitations by combining RGB cameras
with TOF sensors, such as LIDARs. However, there are few works that address
this problem using exclusively the 3D geometric information provided by LIDARs.
In this paper, we propose a PointNet++ based architecture to detect pedestrians
in dense 3D point clouds. The aim is to explore the potential contribution of
geometric information alone in pedestrian detection systems. We also present a
semi-automatic labeling system that transfers pedestrian and non-pedestrian
labels from RGB images onto the 3D domain. The fact that our datasets have RGB
registered with point clouds enables label transferring by back projection from
2D bounding boxes to point clouds, with only a light manual supervision to
validate results. We train PointNet++ with the geometry of the resulting 3D
labelled clusters. The evaluation confirms the effectiveness of the proposed

Each pair of sample units is first associated with a stochastic 'treatment' -

difference. It is then proposed that all such pairs can be combined to provide
more accurate estimates of causal effects in observational data, provided a
statistical model connecting combinatorial properties of treatments to the
accuracy and unbiasedness of their effects. The article introduces one such
model and a Bayesian approach to combine the $O(n^2)$ pairwise observations
typically available in nonexperimnetal data. This also leads to an
interpretation of nonexperimental datasets as incomplete, or noisy, versions of
ideal factorial experimental designs.
  This approach to causal effect estimation has several advantages: (1) it
expands the number of observations, converting thousands of individuals into
millions of observational treatments; (2) starting with treatments closest to
the experimental ideal, it identifies noncausal variables that can be ignored
in the future, making estimation easier in each subsequent iteration while
departing minimally from experiment-like conditions; (3) it recovers individual
causal effects in heterogeneous populations. We evaluate the method in

demonstrate that the proposed approach recovers causal effects in common NSW

Recently, trapping of ions by interaction with light has been demonstrated.
This might permit combining the advantages of optical trapping and ions. For
example, by superimposing optical traps to investigate ensembles of ions and
atoms in absence of any radiofrequency fields, as well as to benefit from the
versatile and scalable trapping geometries featured by optical lattices. In
particular, ions provide individual addressability, electronic and motional
degrees of freedom that can be coherently controlled and detected via high
fidelity, state-dependent operations. Their long-range Coulomb interaction is
significantly larger compared to those of neutral atoms and molecules. This

real-life application. Using the generated samples in training predictive

free-electron scattering, with complicated optical signatures, both in the
continuum and in lines. Focusing on the early nebular phase, at a SN age of
200d, we conduct a systematic study of the polarization signatures associated
with a 56Ni `blob' that breaks spherical symmetry. Our ansatz, supported by
nonLTE radiative transfer calculations, is that the primary role of such a 56Ni
blob is to boost the local density of free electrons, which is otherwise
reduced following recombination in SNe II. Using 2D polarized radiation
transfer modeling, we explore the influence of such an electron-density
enhancement, varying its magnitude N_e_fac, its velocity location V_blob, and
its spatial extent. For plausible N_e_fac values of a few tens, a high-velocity
blob can deliver a continuum polarization P_cont of 0.5-1.0% at 200d. Our
simulations reproduce the analytic scalings for P_cont, and in particular the
linear growth with the blob radial optical depth. The most constraining
information is, however, carried by polarized line photons. For a high V_blob,
the polarized spectrum appears as a replica of the full spectrum, scaled down
by a factor 100 to 1000 (i.e., 1/P_cont), and redshifted by an amount
V_blob(1-cos(alpha_los)), where alpha_los is the line of sight angle. As V_blob
is reduced, the redshift decreases and the replication deteriorates. Lines
whose formation region overlap with the blob appear weaker and narrower in the
polarized flux. Because of its dependence on inclination (~ sin^2 alpha_los),
the polarization preferentially reveals asymmetries in the plane perpendicular
to the line of sight. With the adequate choice of electron-density enhancement,
some of these results may apply to asymmetric explosions in general, or to the
polarization signatures from newly-formed dust in the outer ejecta. [abridged]

with critical current, study their dependence on the string tension $\mu$, and
compare with observational results. For string tensions in the range of $G \mu
= 10^{-10}$, where $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant, there is an
interesting amplification of the two characteristic absorption features, one
during the cosmic dawn, $z \lesssim 30$, and the other during the cosmic dark
age, $z \sim 80$, the former being comparable in amplitude to what was observed
by the EDGES experiment.

and a practical problem with tangible implications for societal health.
Population structure has long been recognized as a catalyst for cooperation
because local interactions enable reciprocity. Analysis of this phenomenon
typically assumes bi-directional social interactions, even though real-world
interactions are often uni-directional. Uni-directional interactions -- where
one individual has the opportunity to contribute altruistically to another, but
not conversely -- arise in real-world populations as the result of
organizational hierarchies, social stratification, popularity effects, and
endogenous mechanisms of network growth. Here we expand the theory of
cooperation in structured populations to account for both uni- and
bi-directional social interactions. Even though directed interactions remove
the opportunity for reciprocity, we find that cooperation can nonetheless be
favored in directed social networks and that cooperation is provably maximized
for networks with an intermediate proportion of directed interactions, as
observed in many empirical settings. We also identify two simple structural
motifs that allow efficient modification of interaction directionality to
promote cooperation by orders of magnitude. We discuss how our results relate
to the concepts of generalized and indirect reciprocity.

magnetic equilibrium effects. This is achieved by adding a light impurity
fractional density ($n_{imp,light} / n_e$) and its normalized gradient, the
normalized pressure gradient ($\alpha$), the toroidal Mach number ($M_{tor}$)

agreement with the original QuaLiKiz model, both by comparing individual
transport quantity predictions as well as comparing its impact within the
integrated model, JINTRAC. The profile-averaged RMS of the integrated modelling
simulations is <10% for each of the 5 scenarios tested. This is non-trivial
given the potential numerical instabilities present within the highly nonlinear

to obtain two different matrix representations -- sum of Kronecker products and
block low-rank format. The use of tensor decompositions enables us to uncover
latent structure in the problem and leads to compressed representations of the

matrix approximations are memory efficient, easy to compute with, and preserve
the error that is due to the tensor compression in the Frobenius norm. Our

in the resolved image suggests that the polarization is scrambled on scales
smaller than the EHT beam, which we attribute to Faraday rotation internal to

response be experimentally demonstrated? We combine theory and experiment to
answer each of these questions. We derive general bounds on the maximum
cross-sections per volume, and we apply an analytical antenna model to show
that resonant nanorods should nearly achieve such bounds. We use a modified
seed-mediated synthesis approach to synthesize ensembles of gold nanorods with
small polydispersity, i.e., small variations in size and aspect ratio.
Polydispersity is the key determinant of how closely such ensembles can
approach their respective bounds yet is difficult to characterize
experimentally without near-field measurements. We show that a certain
""extinction metric,"" connecting extinction cross-section per volume with the
radiative efficiencies of the nanoparticles, offers a quantitative prediction
of polydispersity via quantities that can be rapidly measured with far-field
characterization tools. Our predictions apply generally across all plasmonic

integrated modelling simulation of the JET ITER-like-wall H-mode baseline
discharge #92436 with the QuaLiKiz quasilinear turbulent transport model, which
is the subject of extrapolation towards a deuterium-tritium plasma. The
simulation simultaneously evaluates the time evolution of heat, particle, and
momentum fluxes over $\sim10$ confinement times, with a simulation boundary
condition at $\rho_{tor} = 0.85$. Routine inclusion of momentum transport
prediction in multi-channel flux-driven transport modelling is not standard and
is facilitated here by recent developments within the QuaLiKiz model. Excellent
agreement was achieved between the fitted and simulated profiles for $n_e$,
$T_e$, $T_i$, and $\Omega_{tor}$ within $2\sigma$, but the simulation
underpredicts the mid-radius $T_i$ and overpredicts the core $n_e$ and $T_e$

capable of deriving reasonable inputs, including derivative quantities, to
tokamak models from experimental data. Furthermore, multiple figures-of-merit

  split-plot experiments",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.AP stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The split-plot design assigns different interventions at the whole-plot and
sub-plot levels, respectively, and induces a group structure on the final
treatment assignments. A common strategy is to use the OLS fit of the outcome
on the treatment indicators coupled with the robust standard errors clustered
at the whole-plot level. It does not give consistent estimator for the causal
effects of interest when the whole-plot sizes vary. Another common strategy is
to fit the linear mixed-effects model of the outcome with Normal random effects
and errors. It is a purely model-based approach and can be sensitive to
violations of parametric assumptions. In contrast, the design-based inference
assumes no outcome models and relies solely on the controllable randomization
mechanism determined by the physical experiment. We first extend the existing
design-based inference based on the {\htf} estimator to the Hajek estimator,
and establish the finite-population central limit theorem for both under
split-plot randomization. We then reconcile the results with those under the
model-based approach, and propose two regression strategies, namely (i) the WLS
fit of the unit-level data based on the inverse probability weighting and (ii)
the OLS fit of the aggregate data based on whole-plot total outcomes, to
reproduce the Hajek and {\htf} estimators from least squares, respectively.
This, together with the asymptotic conservativeness of the corresponding
cluster-robust covariances for estimating the true design-based covariances as
we establish in the process, justifies the validity of regression-based
estimators for design-based inference. In light of the flexibility of
regression formulation with covariate adjustment, we further extend the theory
to the case with covariates and demonstrate the efficiency gain by
regression-based covariate adjustment via both asymptotic theory and
simulation.

combines the sensitivity of scattering and the direct visualization benefits of

the intermediate scattering function for many spatiotemporally correlated
systems. Despite its straightforward analysis, DDM has not been fully adopted
as a routine characterization tool, largely due to computational cost and lack
of algorithmic robustness. We present statistical analysis that quantifies the
noise, reduces the computational order and enhances the robustness of DDM
analysis. We propagate the image noise through the Fourier analysis, which
allows us to comprehensively study the bias in different estimators of model
parameters, and we derive a different way to detect whether the bias is
negligible. Furthermore, through use of Gaussian process regression (GPR), we
find that predictive samples of the image structure function require only
around 0.5%-5% of the Fourier transforms of the observed quantities. This
vastly reduces computational cost, while preserving information of the
quantities of interest, such as quantiles of the image scattering function, for
subsequent analysis. The approach, which we call DDM with uncertainty

more emphasis on predicting non-flaring instances (often relatively small

this problem directly, all-clear predictions can be useful in operational
context. However, in all-clear predictions, finding the right balance between
avoiding false negatives (misses) and reducing the false positives (false
alarms) is often challenging. Our study focuses on training and testing a set
of interval-based time series classifiers named Time Series Forest (TSF). These
classifiers will be used towards building an all-clear flare prediction system
by utilizing multivariate time series data. Throughout this paper, we
demonstrate our data collection, predictive model building and evaluation

provide better forecasting results in terms of skill scores, precision and

event-based cameras are not generally available in the market, limiting
performance exploration on high-level models and algorithms. This paper
presents an event camera simulator that can be a potent tool for hardware
design prototyping, parameter optimization, attention-based innovative

distributed computation model to identify relevant regions in an image frame.
Our simulator's relevance computation model is realized as a collection of
modules and performs computations in parallel. The distributed computation
model is configurable, making it highly useful for design space exploration.
The Rendering engine of the simulator samples frame-regions only when there is
a new event. The simulator closely emulates an image processing pipeline
similar to that of physical cameras. Our experimental results show that the

gamma ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun is significantly correlated with that of
protons propagating into space (NSEP) as solar energetic particles (SEPs).
Under the shock paradigm for SGRE, shocks driven by coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) accelerate high-energy protons sending them toward the Sun to produce
SGRE by interacting with the atmospheric particles. Particles also escape into
the space away from the Sun to be detected as SEP events. Therefore, the
significant NSEP vs. Ng correlation (correlation coefficient 0.77) is
consistent with the common shock origin for the two proton populations.
Furthermore, the underlying CMEs have properties akin to those involved in
ground level enhancement (GLE) events indicating the presence of high-energy
(up to GeV) particles required for SGRE. We show that the observed gamma-ray
flux is an underestimate in limb events (central meridian distance > 60
degrees) because SGRE sources are partially occulted when the emission is
spatially extended. With the assumption that the SEP spectrum at the shock nose
is hard and that the 100 MeV particles are accelerated throughout the shock
surface (half width in the range 60 to 120 degrees) we find that the
latitudinal widths of SEP distributions are energy dependent with the smallest
width at the highest energies. Not using the energy-dependent width results in
an underestimate of NSEP in SGRE events occurring at relatively higher
latitudes. Taking these two effects into account removes the apparent lack of
NSEP - Ng correlation reported in previous studies.

of trust management is particularly challenging in mixed human-robot teams
where the human and the robot may have different models about the task at hand
and thus may have different expectations regarding the current course of
action, thereby forcing the robot to focus on the costly explicable behavior.
We propose a computational model for capturing and modulating trust in such
iterated human-robot interaction settings, where the human adopts a supervisory
role. In our model, the robot integrates human's trust and their expectations
about the robot into its planning process to build and maintain trust over the
interaction horizon. By establishing the required level of trust, the robot can
focus on maximizing the team goal by eschewing explicit explanatory or
explicable behavior without worrying about the human supervisor monitoring and
intervening to stop behaviors they may not necessarily understand. We model
this reasoning about trust levels as a meta reasoning process over individual
planning tasks. We additionally validate our model through a human subject
experiment.

remains a daunting challenge. We propose to address this challenge in the
recently introduced replica-mean-field (RMF) limit. In this limit, networks are
made of infinitely many replicas of the finite network of interest, but with
randomized interactions across replicas. Such randomization renders certain
excitatory networks fully tractable at the cost of neglecting activity
correlations, but with explicit dependence on the finite size of the neural
constituents. However, metastable dynamics typically unfold in networks with
mixed inhibition and excitation. Here, we extend the RMF computational
framework to point-process-based neural network models with exponential
stochastic intensities, allowing for mixed excitation and inhibition. Within
this setting, we show that metastable finite-size networks admit multistable
RMF limits, which are fully characterized by stationary firing rates.
Technically, these stationary rates are determined as the solutions of a set of
delayed differential equations under certain regularity conditions that any
physical solutions shall satisfy. We solve this original problem by combining
the resolvent formalism and singular-perturbation theory. Importantly, we find
that these rates specify probabilistic pseudo-equilibria which accurately
capture the neural variability observed in the original finite-size network. We
also discuss the emergence of metastability as a stochastic bifurcation, which
can be interpreted as a static phase transition in the RMF limits. In turn, we
expect to leverage the static picture of RMF limits to infer purely dynamical
features of metastable finite-size networks, such as the transition rates
between pseudo-equilibria.

some agent almost surely. We formalize the dynamics of agents by consumption
Markov decision processes. In a consumption Markov decision process, the agent
has a resource of limited capacity. Each action of the agent may consume some
amount of the resource. To avoid exhaustion, the agent can replenish its
resource to full capacity in designated reload states. The resource capacity
restricts the capabilities of the agent. The objective is to assign target
locations to agents, and each agent is only responsible for visiting the
assigned subset of target locations repeatedly. Moreover, the assignment must
ensure that the agents can carry out their tasks with minimal resource
capacity. We reduce the problem of finding target assignments for a team of
agents with the lowest possible capacity to an equivalent graph-theoretical

challenges in OSHP, i.e., small sizes, testing bias, and similar parts, we
devise an End-to-end One-shot human Parsing Network (EOP-Net). Firstly, an
end-to-end human parsing framework is proposed to parse the query image into
both coarse-grained and fine-grained human classes, which builds a strong
embedding network with rich semantic information shared across different
granularities, facilitating identifying small-sized human classes. Then, we
propose learning momentum-updated prototypes by gradually smoothing the
training time static prototypes, which helps stabilize the training and learn
robust features. Moreover, we devise a dual metric learning scheme which
encourages the network to enhance features' both representational capability
and transferability. Therefore, our EOP-Net can learn representative features
that can quickly adapt to the novel classes and mitigate the testing bias
issue. In addition, we employ a contrastive loss at the prototype level,
thereby enforcing the distances among the classes in the fine-grained metric
space to discriminate similar parts. We tailor three existing popular human
parsing benchmarks to the OSHP task. Experiments on the new benchmarks
demonstrate that EOP-Net outperforms representative one-shot segmentation
models by large margins, which serves as a strong baseline for further research
on this new task. The source code is available at

length of basic secret-key primitives, such as blockciphers. To address this we
will either need to use blockciphers which inherently have longer keys or use
key-length extension techniques which employ a blockcipher to construct a more
secure blockcipher that uses longer keys.
  We consider the latter approach and revisit the FX and double encryption
constructions. Classically, FX is known to be secure, while double encryption
is no more secure than single encryption due to a meet-in-the-middle attack. We
provide positive results, with concrete and tight bounds, for both of these
constructions against quantum attackers in ideal models.
  For FX, we consider a partially-quantum model, where the attacker has quantum
access to the ideal primitive, but only classic access to FX. We provide two
results for FX in this model. The first establishes the security of FX against
non-adaptive attackers. The second establishes security against general
adaptive attacks for a variant of FX using a random oracle in place of an ideal
cipher. This result relies on the techniques of Zhandry (CRYPTO '19) for lazily
sampling a quantum random oracle. An extension to perfectly lazily sampling a
quantum random permutation, which would help resolve the adaptive security of
standard FX, is an important but challenging open question. We introduce
techniques for partially-quantum proofs without relying on analyzing the
classical and quantum oracles separately, which is common in existing work.
This may be of broader interest.
  For double encryption we apply a technique of Tessaro and Thiruvengadam (TCC
'18) to establish that security reduces to the difficulty of solving the list
disjointness problem, which we are able to reduce through a chain of results to
the known quantum difficulty of the element distinctness problem.

competitive analysis in online learning, as a criterion for controller design
we introduce the dynamic regret, defined as the difference between the LQR cost
of a causal controller (that has only access to past disturbances) and the LQR
cost of the \emph{unique} clairvoyant one (that has also access to future
disturbances) that is known to dominate all other controllers. The regret
itself is a function of the disturbances, and we propose to find a causal
controller that minimizes the worst-case regret over all bounded energy
disturbances. The resulting controller has the interpretation of guaranteeing
the smallest regret compared to the best non-causal controller that can see the
future. We derive explicit formulas for the optimal regret and for the
regret-optimal controller for the state-space setting. These explicit solutions
are obtained by showing that the regret-optimal control problem can be reduced
to a Nehari extension problem that can be solved explicitly. The regret-optimal
controller is shown to be linear and can be expressed as the sum of the
classical $H_2$ state-feedback law and an $n$-th order controller ($n$ is the
state dimension), and its construction simply requires a solution to the
standard LQR Riccati equation and two Lyapunov equations. Simulations over a
range of plants demonstrate that the regret-optimal controller interpolates
nicely between the $H_2$ and the $H_\infty$ optimal controllers, and generally
has $H_2$ and $H_\infty$ costs that are simultaneously close to their optimal
values. The regret-optimal controller thus presents itself as a viable option
for control systems design.

Idealized three-dimensional geometric models of coarctation of the aorta and
aortic aneurysm are designed, respectively. The unique hemodynamic environment
of the diseased aorta is used to improve nanoparticle drug delivery.
Micro-carriers with nanoparticle drugs would be targeting activated to release
nanoparticle drugs by local abnormal shear stress rate (SSR). Coarctation of
the aorta provides a high SSR hemodynamic environment, while the aortic
aneurysm is exposed to low SSR. We propose a method to calculate the SSR
thresholds for the diseased aorta. Results show that the upstream near-wall
area of the diseased location is an ideal injection location for the
micro-carriers, which could be activated by the abnormal SSR. Released
nanoparticle drugs would be successfully targeted delivered to the aortic
diseased wall. Besides, the high diffusivity of the micro-carriers and
nanoparticle drugs has a significant impact on the surface drug concentrations
of the diseased aortic walls, especially for aortic aneurysms. This study
preliminary demonstrates the feasibility of shear-activated targeted

opposed wall-jet forcing (SOJF) methods is studied in a turbulent channel flow
via direct numerical simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
A maximum drag reduction of about 33% is obtained for CDC -- much higher than
that produced by either individual method (namely, 19% for SOJF and 23% for
OC). Due to the small power input required for both OC and SOJF methods, a
significant net power saving (about 32%) is achieved via CDC. Flow analysis
shows that CDC can take advantage of both OC and SOJF methods to better
suppress drag producing, near-wall turbulent structures -- vortices and
streaks. In particular, due to the presence of the large-scale coherent swirls
generated by SOJF, it is more effective than OC in suppressing the random
turbulence. Moreover, due to the OC's role in suppressing random small-scale
turbulence, CDC requires weaker large-scale coherent swirls than those using
SOJF only -- hence decreasing the drag contribution associated with large-scale
swirls. In summary, our results suggest prospects of employing composite
control strategy for effective skin friction drag reduction, particularly at
very high Reynolds numbers.

Lars Onsager predicted that adding energy to the fluid can lead to the

(OV) clusters. In the evolution of 2D superfluid turbulence in a uniform
disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), it was discovered that a pair of OV
clusters with opposite signs can form without any energy input. This striking
spontaneous order was explained as due to a vortex evaporative-heating
mechanism, i.e., annihilations of vortex-antivortex pairs which remove the
lowest-energy vortices and thereby boost the mean energy per vortex. However,
in our search for exotic OV states in a boundaryless 2D spherical BEC, we found
that OV clusters never form despite the annihilations of vortex pairs. Our
analysis reveals that contrary to the general belief, vortex-pair annihilation
emits intense sound waves, which damp the motion of all vortices and hence
suppress the formation of OV clusters. We also present unequivocal evidences
showing that the true mechanism underlying the observed spontaneous OV state is
the escaping of vortices from the BEC boundary. Uncovering this mechanism paves
the way for a comprehensive understanding of emergent vortex orders in 2D
manifolds of superfluids driven far from equilibrium.

the same height with the same minimum elevation angle to the satellites, which
may not be practical due to possible route conflict with airplanes and other
flight equipment. In this paper, we consider a TSN containing hot air balloons
at different heights and with different minimum elevation angles, which creates
the challenge of non-uniform available serving time for the communication
between the hot air balloons and the satellites. Jointly considering the
caching, computing, and communication (3C) resource management for both the
ground-balloon-satellite links and inter-satellite laser links, our objective
is to maximize the network energy efficiency. Firstly, by proposing a tapped
water-filling algorithm, we schedule the traffic to relay among satellites
according to the available serving time of satellites. Then, we generate a
series of configuration matrices, based on which we formulate the relationship
of relay time and the power consumption involved in the relay among satellites.
Finally, the integrated system model of TSN is built and solved by geometric

proposed for uplink multiuser single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) joint
transmitter and non-coherent receiver design (JTRD) in fading channels. The
basic idea lies in the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to replace
traditional communication modules at both transmitter and receiver sides. More
specifically, the transmitter side is modeled as a group of parallel linear
layers, which are responsible for multiuser waveform design; and the
non-coherent receiver is formed by a deep feed-forward neural network (DFNN) so
as to provide multiuser detection (MUD) capabilities. The entire JTRD-Net can
be trained from end to end to adapt to channel statistics through deep
learning. After training, JTRD-Net can work efficiently in a non-coherent
manner without requiring any levels of channel state information (CSI). In
addition to the network architecture, a novel weight-initialization method,
namely symmetrical-interval initialization, is proposed for JTRD-Net. It is
shown that the symmetrical-interval initialization outperforms the conventional
method (e.g. Xavier initialization) in terms of well-balanced convergence-rate
among users. Simulation results show that the proposed JTRD-Net approach takes
significant advantages in terms of reliability and scalability over baseline
schemes on both i.i.d. complex Gaussian channels and spatially-correlated
channels.

because that it can provide an adjustable self-scheduling strategy for GENCOs

translated into semi-definite programming (SDP) for solution, however, solving
large-scale SDP needs a lot of computational time and resources. For this
shortcoming, two effective approximate models are pro-posed: one approximate
model based on vector splitting and an-other based on alternate direction
multiplier method (ADMM), both can greatly reduce the calculation time and
resources, and the second approximate model only needs the information of the
current area in each step of the solution and thus information private is
guaranteed. Simulations of three IEEE test systems are conducted to demonstrate
the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed DRO model and two approximate

be in conflict with security of both users and trips. While LBS providers could
adopt privacy preservation mechanisms to obfuscate customer data, the accuracy
of vehicle location data and trajectories is crucial for detecting anomalies,
especially when machine learning methods are adopted by LBS. This paper aims to
tackle this dilemma by evaluating the tradeoff between location privacy and
security in LBS. In particular, we investigate the impact of applying location
data privacy-preservation techniques on the performance of two detectors,
namely a Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN),
and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The experimental results suggest that, by
applying privacy on location data, DBSCAN is more sensitive to Laplace noise
than RNN, although they achieve similar detection accuracy on the trip data
without privacy preservation. Further experiments reveal that DBSCAN is not
scalable to large size datasets containing millions of trips, because of the
large number of computations needed for clustering trips. On the other hand,
DBSCAN only requires less than 10 percent of the data used by RNN to achieve
similar performance when applied to vehicle data without obfuscation,
demonstrating that clustering-based methods can be easily applied to small
datasets. Based on the results, we recommend usage scenarios of the two types
of trajectory anomaly detectors when applying privacy preservation, by taking
into account customers' need for privacy, the size of the available vehicle
trip data, and real-time constraints of the LBS application.

The SAS procedure borrows information from surrogates along with candidate

the imputation model and a one-step bias correction to enable interval
estimation for the predicted risk. We demonstrate that the SAS procedure
provides valid inference for the predicted risk derived from a high dimensional
working model, even when the underlying risk prediction model is dense and the
risk model is mis-specified. We present an extensive simulation study to

approximations due to smoothness in the physical and/or temporal domain of the
problem. In large-scale problems, computing an optimal low-rank approximation
can be prohibitively expensive. Matrix sketching addresses this by reducing the
input matrix to a smaller, but representative matrix via a low-dimensional
linear embedding. If the sketch matrix produced by the embedding captures
sufficient geometric properties of the original matrix, then a near-optimal
approximation may be obtained. Much of the work done in matrix sketching has
centered on random projection. Alternatively, in this work, deterministic
matrix sketches which generate coarse representations, compatible with the
corresponding PDE solve, are considered in the computation of the singular
value decomposition and matrix interpolative decomposition. The deterministic
sketching approaches in this work have many advantages over randomized
sketches. Broadly, randomized sketches are data-agnostic, whereas the proposed
sketching methods exploit structures within data generated in complex PDE
systems. These deterministic sketches are often faster, require access to a
small fraction of the input matrix, and do not need to be explicitly
constructed. A novel single-pass, i.e., requiring one read over the input,
power iteration algorithm is also presented. The power iteration method is
particularly effective in improving low-rank approximations when the singular

accelerator that unifies dense and sparse matrix multiplication. By applying
this single optimized systolic array to both aggregation and transformation
phases, we have significantly reduced chip sizes and energy consumption. We
then divide the computing engine into blocked systolic arrays to support the
\textit{Strassen}'s algorithm for dense matrix multiplication, dramatically
scaling down the number of multiplications and enabling high-throughput
computation of GNNs. To balance the workload of sparse-dense matrix
multiplication, we also introduced a greedy algorithm to combine sparse
sub-matrices of compressed format into condensed ones to reduce computational
cycles. Compared with current state-of-the-art GNN software frameworks,
\textit{VersaGNN} achieves on average 3712$\times$ speedup with 1301.25$\times$
energy reduction on CPU, and 35.4$\times$ speedup with 17.66$\times$ energy
reduction on GPU.

organizations who own data but not ML expertise (data owner) would like to pool
their data and collaborate with those who have expertise but need data from
diverse sources to train truly generalizable models (model owner). In such
collaborative ML, the data owner wants to protect the privacy of its training
data, while the model owner desires the confidentiality of the model and the
training method which may contain intellectual properties. However, existing
private ML solutions, such as federated learning and split learning, cannot
meet the privacy requirements of both data and model owners at the same time.
  This paper presents Citadel, a scalable collaborative ML system that protects
the privacy of both data owner and model owner in untrusted infrastructures
with the help of Intel SGX. Citadel performs distributed training across
multiple training enclaves running on behalf of data owners and an aggregator
enclave on behalf of the model owner. Citadel further establishes a strong
information barrier between these enclaves by means of zero-sum masking and
hierarchical aggregation to prevent data/model leakage during collaborative
training. Compared with the existing SGX-protected training systems, Citadel
enables better scalability and stronger privacy guarantees for collaborative
ML. Cloud deployment with various ML models shows that Citadel scales to a
large number of enclaves with less than 1.73X slowdown caused by SGX.

proposed method, the adaptive basis is defined by the low-rank update

computational cost of the ROM basis, the auxiliary vectors are algebraically
derived by optimizing a local residual operator. As a result, the reliability
of ROM is significantly improved with a low computational cost because the
error information can be contained without inverse operations of the full model
dimension required in conventional approaches. The other feature of the
proposed iterative algorithm is that the number of the initial incremental ROM
basis could be varied, unlike in the typical online adaptive basis approaches.
It may provide a fast and effective spanning process of the high-quality ROM

valuable information on earthquake shaking history and landscape development
for a region. With this geomorphology problem as the test domain, we
demonstrate a pipeline for detecting, localizing, and precisely mapping fragile
geologic features distributed on a landscape. To do so, we first carry out a
lawn-mower search pattern in the survey region from a high elevation using an
Unpiloted Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Once a potential PBR target is detected by a
deep neural network, we track the bounding box in the image frames using a
real-time tracking algorithm. The location and occupancy of the target in world
coordinates are estimated using a sampling-based filtering algorithm, where a
set of 3D points are re-sampled after weighting by the tracked bounding boxes
from different camera perspectives. The converged 3D points provide a prior on
3D bounding shape of a target, which is used for UAV path planning to closely
and completely map the target with Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM). After target mapping, the UAV resumes the lawn-mower search pattern to
find the next target. We introduce techniques to make the target mapping robust
to false positive and missing detection from the neural network. Our
target-oriented mapping system has the advantages of reducing map storage and
emphasizing complete visible surface features on specified targets.

systems. Recently, central difference convolution (CDC) has shown its excellent
representation capacity for the FAS task via leveraging local gradient
features. However, aggregating central difference clues from all
neighbors/directions simultaneously makes the CDC redundant and sub-optimized
in the training phase. In this paper, we propose two Cross Central Difference
Convolutions (C-CDC), which exploit the difference of the center and surround
sparse local features from the horizontal/vertical and diagonal directions,
respectively. It is interesting to find that, with only five ninth parameters
and less computational cost, C-CDC even outperforms the full directional CDC.
Based on these two decoupled C-CDC, a powerful Dual-Cross Central Difference
Network (DC-CDN) is established with Cross Feature Interaction Modules (CFIM)
for mutual relation mining and local detailed representation enhancement.
Furthermore, a novel Patch Exchange (PE) augmentation strategy for FAS is
proposed via simply exchanging the face patches as well as their dense labels
from random samples. Thus, the augmented samples contain richer live/spoof
patterns and diverse domain distributions, which benefits the intrinsic and
robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments are performed on four
benchmark datasets with three testing protocols to demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance.

tensors, which includes the canonical energy-momentum. Even though the
canonical energy is unbounded, the other representatives in the series can have
bounded from below $00$-component. The theory admits consistent
self-interactions with the Yang-Mills gauge symmetry. The Lagrangian couplings
preserve the unbounded from below energy-momentum tensor, and they do not lead
to a stable non-linear theory. The non-Lagrangian couplings are consistent with
the existence of conserved tensor with a bounded from below $00$-component.
These models are stable at the non-linear level. The dynamics of interacting
theory admits a constraint Hamiltonian form. The Hamiltonian density is given
by the $00$-component of the conserved tensor. In the case of stable
interactions, the Poisson bracket and Hamiltonian do not follow from the
canonical Ostrogradski construction. The particular attention is paid to the
""triply massless"" ECS theory, which demonstrates instability already at the

It is observed that deuteron and anti-deuteron freezeout later than triton and
helion as well as their anti-particles due to its smaller mass, while helion
and triton, and anti-helion and anti-triton freezeout at the same time due to
isospin symmetry at higher energies. It is also observed that light nuclei
freezeout earlier than their anti-nuclei due to the large coalescence of
nucleons for light nuclei compared to their anti-nuclei. The kinetic freezeout

from central to peripheral collisions. Furthermore, the transverse flow
velocity depends on mass of the particle which decreases with increasing the

  Segmentation","5 pages, 3 figures, Interspeech conference",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In a hybrid speech model, both voiced and unvoiced components can coexist in
a segment. Often, the voiced speech is regarded as the deterministic component,
and the unvoiced speech and additive noise are the stochastic components.
Typically, the speech signal is considered stationary within fixed segments of
20-40 ms, but the degree of stationarity varies over time. For decomposing
noisy speech into its voiced and unvoiced components, a fixed segmentation may
be too crude, and we here propose to adapt the segment length according to the
signal local characteristics. The segmentation relies on parameter estimates of
a hybrid speech model and the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and log-likelihood
criteria as rules for model selection among the possible segment lengths, for
voiced and unvoiced speech, respectively. Given the optimal segmentation
markers and the estimated statistics, both components are estimated using
linear filtering. A codebook-based approach differentiates between unvoiced
speech and noise. A better extraction of the components is possible by taking
into account the adaptive segmentation, compared to a fixed one. Also, a lower
distortion for voiced speech and higher segSNR for both components is possible,
as compared to other decomposition methods.

how these properties are related to the oscillations of correlation functions.
This approach can be used for analysis of phase transitions with local or
nonlocal order parameters, as well as for the disorder lines. We find an
infinite cascade of disorder lines at finite temperature in the quantum $XY$
chain (equivalent to free fermions). The well-known ground state factorization
on the disorder line, and consequently, disentanglement, is shown to follow
directly from analytical properties of this model on the complex plane. From
the quantum-classical correspondence the results for the chain are used to
detect the disorder lines in several frustrated 2D Ising models. The present
formalism can be applied to other fermionic models in two and three spatial
dimensions. In particular, we find the temperature-dependent Fermi wave vector
of oscillations in the degenerate gas of 3D fermions, which naturally leads in
the limit $T \to 0$ to the definition of the Fermi energy as the surface of
quantum criticality. The modulation is a very common phenomenon, and it occurs
in a large variety of models. The important point is that all these modulation
transitions can be related to the complex zeros of partition functions, as done
in the present study.

of the most difficult jamming attacks to deal with in practice. Specifically,
the jammer has an unlimited power budget and is equipped with the
self-interference suppression capability to simultaneously attack and listen to
the transmitter's activities. Consequently, dealing with super-reactive jammers
is very challenging. Thus, we introduce a smart deception mechanism to attract
the jammer to continuously attack the channel and then leverage jamming signals
to transmit data based on the ambient backscatter communication technology. To
detect the backscattered signals, the maximum likelihood detector can be
adopted. However, this method is notorious for its high computational
complexity and requires the model of the current propagation environment as
well as channel state information. Hence, we propose a deep learning-based
detector that can dynamically adapt to any channels and noise distributions.
With a Long Short-Term Memory network, our detector can learn the received
signals' dependencies to achieve a performance close to that of the optimal
maximum likelihood detector. Through simulation and theoretical results, we
demonstrate that with our approaches, the more power the jammer uses to attack
the channel, the better bit error rate performance the transmitter can achieve.

Major enterprise technologies are contrasted in parallel to EOSIO to better
understand how EOSIO can evolve to meet the trends seen in enterprise
blockchain privacy. The following strategies and trends were generally observed
in these technologies:
  Cryptography: the hashing algorithm was found to be the most used
cryptographic primitive in enterprise or changeover privacy solutions.
Coordination via on-chain contracts - a common strategy was to use a shared
publicly ledger to coordinate data privacy groups and more generally managed
identities and access control.
  Transaction and contract code sharing: there was a variety of different
levels of privacy around the business logic (smart contract code) visibility.
Some solutions only allowed authorised peers to view code while others made
this accessible to everybody that was a member of the shared ledger.
  Data migrations for data privacy applications: significant challenges exist
when using cryptographically stored data in terms of being able to run system
upgrades.
  Multiple blockchain ledgers for data privacy: solutions attempted to create a
new private blockchain for every private data relationship which was eventually
abandoned in favour of one shared ledger with private data
collections/transactions that were anchored to the ledger with a hash in order

interactions is to use their gauge invariant description based on the
introduction of the appropriate set of Stueckelberg fields. Recently, the
general properties of such approach were investigated in [1]. The main findings
of this work can be formulated in two statements. At first, there always exist
enough field redefinitions to bring the vertex into abelian form where there
are some corrections to the gauge transformations but the gauge algebra is
undeformed. At second, with the further (as a rule higher derivative) field
redefinitions one can bring the vertex into trivially gauge invariant form
expressed in terms of the gauge invariant objects of the free theory.
  Our aim in this work is to show (using a simple example) how these general
properties are realised in the so-called Fradkin-Vasiliev formalism and to see
the effects (if any) that the presence of massless field, and hence of some
unbroken gauge symmetries, can produce. As such example we take the
gravitational interaction for massive spin-3/2 field so we complete the
investigation started in [2] relaxing all restrictions on the number of
derivatives and allowed field redefinitions. We show that in spite of the
presence of massless spin-2 field, the first statement is still valid, while
there exist two abelian vertices which are not equivalent on-shell to the
trivially gauge invariant ones. Moreover, it is one of this abelian vertices
that reproduce the minimal interaction for massive spin-3/2.

Weights are estimated first and then used in a weighted association model. When
the IPW method is used, instead of using a so-called na{\""i}ve variance
estimator, the literature recommends using a robust variance estimator.
However, the latter may overestimate the variance because the weights are
considered known rather than estimated. In this note, we develop, by a
linearization technique, an estimator accounting for the weight estimation
phase and explain how it differs from na{\""i}ve and robust variance estimators.
We compare the three variance estimators through simulations under several MAR

estimators were approximately unbiased, even in MNAR scenarios. The naive
variance estimator severely underestimated the variance. We encourage
researchers to be careful with variance estimation when using the IPW method,

solution of a linear system of equations. Solving these linear systems is
non-trivial due to the severe ill-conditioning of the matrices towards
convergence. This issue can be alleviated by incorporating suitable
regularization terms in the linear programming problem. Regularization also
allows us to efficiently handle rank deficient constraint matrices. We provide
a convergence analysis of a regularized inexact interior-point method. The term
`inexact' refers to the fact that we do not need to compute the true solution
of the linear system of equations, only an approximation thereof. The
formulation of the algorithm is sufficiently general such that specialized
linear algebra routines developed in other work on inexact interior-point
methods can also be incorporated in our regularized framework. In this work, we
exploit the inexactness by using a mixed-precision solver for the linear system
of equations. More specifically, we perform a Cholesky factorization in IEEE
single precision and use it as a preconditioner for the Conjugate Gradient
method. Numerical experiments illustrate the benefits of this approach applied
to linear programming problems with a dense constraint matrix.

learning paradigm and more specifically, the confirmation that deep learning

has been shaking up traditional research in image processing. The same can be
said for research in communities working on applied harmonic analysis,
information geometry, variational methods, etc. For many researchers, this is
viewed as an existential threat. On the one hand, research funding agencies
privilege mainstream approaches especially when these are unquestionably
suitable for solving real problems and for making progress on artificial
intelligence. On the other hand, successful publishing of research in our
communities is becoming almost exclusively based on a quantitative improvement
of the accuracy of any benchmark task. As most of my colleagues sharing this
research field, I am confronted with the dilemma of continuing to invest my
time and intellectual effort on mathematical morphology as my driving force for
research, or simply focussing on how to use deep learning and contributing to
it. The solution is not obvious to any of us since our research is not
fundamental, it is just oriented to solve challenging problems, which can be
more or less theoretical. Certainly, it would be foolish for anyone to claim
that deep learning is insignificant or to think that one's favourite image
processing domain is productive enough to ignore the state-of-the-art. I fully
understand that the labs and leading people in image processing communities
have been shifting their research to almost exclusively focus on deep learning
techniques. My own position is different: I do think there is room for progress
on mathematically grounded image processing branches, under the condition that
these are rethought in a broader sense from the deep learning paradigm. Indeed,
I firmly believe that the convergence between mathematical morphology and the
computation methods which gravitate around deep learning (fully connected
networks, convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, recurrent
neural networks, etc.) is worthwhile. The goal of this talk is to discuss my
personal vision regarding these potential interactions. Without any pretension
of being exhaustive, I want to address it with a series of open questions,
covering a wide range of specificities of morphological operators and
representations, which could be tackled and revisited under the paradigm of
deep learning. An expected benefit of such convergence between morphology and
deep learning is a cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between both
fields. In addition, I think the future answer to some of these questions can
provide some insight on understanding, interpreting and simplifying deep
learning networks.

transition from a metastable to an absorbing state, analogous to the pressure
required to overcome surface tension in bubble formation. This yields
quantitative estimates of the spark generation probability as a function of
various system parameters. Our model of the release channel system yields
similar results for the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca concentration threshold for
spark activation as previous experimental results, providing a mechanistic
explanation of the spark initiation. Additionally, we perform numerical

efforts into flows, give rise to Dirac structures on a bounded spatial domain

extended to pairs of linear differential operators defining a formally

the underlying repeated integration by parts operation can be streamlined by

networks in edge devices, model quantization has been successfully applied in
many practical applications. No matter the methods of quantization aware
training (QAT) or post-training quantization (PTQ), they all depend on the
target bit-widths. When the precision of quantization is adjusted, it is
necessary to fine-tune the quantized model or minimize the quantization noise,
which brings inconvenience in practical applications. In this work, we propose
a method to train a model for all quantization that supports diverse bit-widths
(e.g., form 8-bit to 1-bit) to satisfy the online quantization bit-width
adjustment. It is hot-swappable that can provide specific quantization
strategies for different candidates through multiscale quantization. We use
wavelet decomposition and reconstruction to increase the diversity of weights,
thus significantly improving the performance of each quantization candidate,
especially at ultra-low bit-widths (e.g., 3-bit, 2-bit, and 1-bit).
Experimental results on ImageNet and COCO show that our method can achieve
accuracy comparable performance to dedicated models trained at the same
precision.

tuned by the spin splitting field $h$ driving the system from the topologically
trivial to the nontrivial superconducting state. The phase $\varphi_0$ vanishes
for rather small $h$, grows in a certain field range around the topological
transition, and then saturates at large $h$ in the Kitaev regime. Both the
subgap and the continuum quasiparticle levels are responsible for the above
behavior of the anomalous Josephson phase. It is demonstrated that the

Neptune-like planets. This thermal boundary layer (TBL) is assumed to be
located deep in the planet, and be caused by a steep compositional gradient
between a H-He-dominated outer envelope and an ice-rich inner envelope. We
investigate the effect of TBL thickness, thermal conductivity, and the time of
TBL formation on the planet's cooling behaviour. The calculations were
performed with our recently developed tool based on the Henyey method for
stellar evolution. We make use of state-of-the-art equations of state for
hydrogen, helium, and water, as well as of thermal conductivity data for water
calculated via ab initio methods. We find that even a thin conductive layer of
a few kilometres has a significant influence on the planetary cooling. In our
models, Uranus' measured luminosity can only be reproduced if the planet has
been near equilibrium with the solar incident flux for an extended time. For
Neptune, we find a range of solutions with a near constant effective
temperature at layer thicknesses of 15 km or larger, similar to Uranus. In
addition, we find solutions for thin TBLs of few km and strongly enhanced
thermal conductivity. A $\sim$ 1$~$Gyr later onset of the TBL reduces the
present $\Delta T$ by an order of magnitude to only several 100 K. Our models
suggest that a TBL can significantly influence the present planetary luminosity
in both directions, making it appear either brighter or fainter than the
adiabatic case.

symmetry-breaking bifurcations can lead to mixed dynamics due to accompanying
global reversible bifurcations of symmetric non-transversal homo- and
heteroclinic cycles. We also generalize the results of Dullin and Meiss to the

36 are tabulated. Families of cubic graphs of orders $4n+2$ and $4n+4$ with
$2^n$ edge-Kempe equivalence classes are presented; it is conjectured that
there are no cubic graphs with more edge-Kempe equivalence classes. New
families of nonplanar bipartite cubic graphs with exactly one edge-Kempe
equivalence class are also obtained. Edge-Kempe switching is further connected
to cycle switching of Steiner triple systems, for which an improvement of the
established classification algorithm is presented.

feedbackless multi-hop wireless packet network transmission with packet loss.
The data to be transmitted is encoded into batches where each of which consists
of a few coded packets. Unlike the traditional forwarding strategy, the
intermediate network nodes have to perform recoding, which generates recoded
packets by network coding operations restricted within the same batch. Adaptive
recoding is a technique to adapt the fluctuation of packet loss by optimizing
the number of recoded packets per batch to enhance the throughput. The input
rank distribution, which is a piece of information regarding the batches
arriving at the node, is required to apply adaptive recoding. However, this
distribution is not known in advance in practice as the incoming link's channel
condition may change from time to time. On the other hand, to fully utilize the
potential of adaptive recoding, we need to have a good estimation of this
distribution. In other words, we need to guess this distribution from a few
samples so that we can apply adaptive recoding as soon as possible. In this
paper, we propose a distributionally robust optimization for adaptive recoding

develop an algorithm to efficiently solve this optimization with the support of
theoretical guarantees that our optimization's performance would constitute as

spacetime limit, the quantum walk reproduces the Dirac equation corresponding
to the model, which allows to anticipate some of the properties that can be
reproduced by the quantum walk. In particular, we observe that the probability
distribution becomes, at large time steps, concentrated near the ""low energy""
brane, and can be approximated as the lowest eigenstate of the continuum
Hamiltonian that is compatible with the symmetries of the model. In this way,
we obtain a localization effect whose strength is controlled by a warp
coefficient. In other words, here localization arises from the geometry of the
model, at variance with the usual effect that is originated from random
irregularities, as in Anderson localization. In summary, we establish an
interesting correspondence between a high energy physics model and localization
in quantum walks.

of boundary conditions. In this form, we make the system driven to a

another one that contains the non-equilibrium behavior and that we call {\it

Moreover $\bar C^{(1)}$ is always long-range or zero when $M>1$. Surprisingly
we show that their associated fluctuations, the space integrals of $\bar

Multiple hypothesis tracking is a popular algorithm for solving this problem

robustness, we propose a randomized multiple model multiple hypothesis tracking
method, which has three distinctive advantages. First, it yields a randomized
data association solution which maximizes the expectation of the logarithm of
the posterior probability and can be solved efficiently by linear programming.
Next, the state estimation performance is improved by the random coefficient
matrices Kalman filter, which mitigates the difficulty introduced by randomized
data association, i.e., where the coefficient matrices of the dynamic system
are random. Third, the probability that the target follows a specific dynamic
model is derived by jointly optimizing the multiple possible models and data
association hypotheses, and it does not require prior mode transition
probabilities. Thus, it is more robust for tracking multiple maneuvering
targets. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency and superior results of the

two languages for Boolean functions: standard conjunction-disjunction-negation

proof-theoretical naturalness: the system consists of all and only the
inference rules generated by the single, simple, linear scheme of the recently
introduced subatomic logic. Thanks to this regularity, cuts are eliminated via
a natural construction. The second reason is that the system generates
efficient proofs. Indeed, we show that a certain class of tautologies due to
Statman, which cannot have better than exponential cut-free proofs in the
sequent calculus, have polynomial cut-free proofs in our system. We achieve
this by using the same construction that we use for cut elimination. In
summary, by expanding the language of propositional logic, we make its proof
theory more regular and generate more proofs, some of which are very efficient.
  That design is made possible by considering atoms as superpositions of their
truth values, which are connected by self-dual, non-commutative connectives. A
proof can then be projected via each atom into two proofs, one for each truth
value, without a need for cuts. Those projections are semantically natural and
are at the heart of the constructions in this paper. To accommodate self-dual
non-commutativity, we compose proofs in deep inference.

fundamentally a challenging and time consuming task. Here we report the
development of a deep neural network based computational framework capable of
solving the forward (predictive) as well as inverse (generative) design
problem. The predictor model is based on the popular convolution neural network
architecture and trained with the help of finite element simulations. Further,
the developed property predictor model is used as a feedback mechanism in the
neural network based generator model. The proposed predictive-generative model
can be used to obtain the micro-structure for maximization of particular
elastic properties as well as for specified elastic constants. One of the major
hurdle for deployment of the deep learning techniques in composite material
design is the intensive computational resources required to generate the
training data sets. To this end, a novel data augmentation scheme is presented.
The application of data augmentation scheme results in significant saving of
computational resources in the training phase. The proposed data augmentation
approach is general and can be used in any setting involving the periodic
micro-structures. The efficacy of the predictive-generative model is
demonstrated through various examples. It is envisaged that the developed model
will significantly reduce the cost and time associated with the composite
material designing process for advanced applications.

Model-level maps provide an understanding of what the entire DNN model focuses

underlying surface geometry of common categories, such as human faces, cars,

approaches solve this problem using extensive supervision in the form of
pixel-level annotations, we take advantage of the fact that pixel-level UV and
mesh predictions can be combined with 3D reprojections to form consistency
cycles. As a result of exploiting these cycles, we can establish a dense
correspondence mapping between image pixels and the mesh acting as a
self-supervisory signal, which in turn helps improve our overall estimates. Our
approach leverages information from multiple views of the object to establish
additional consistency cycles, thus improving surface mapping understanding
without the need for explicit annotations. We also propose the use of
deformation fields for predictions of an instance specific mesh. Given the lack
of datasets providing multiple images of similar object instances from
different viewpoints, we generate and release a multi-view ShapeNet Cars and
Airplanes dataset created by rendering ShapeNet meshes using a 360 degree
camera trajectory around the mesh. For the human faces category, we process and
adapt an existing dataset to a multi-view setup. Through experimental

specified point, we have an associated weight, and the problem objective is to
find a maximum-weight point within every given interval.
  The current work addresses range searching with stochastic weights: each
point corresponds to an arm (that admits sample access) and the point's weight
is the (unknown) mean of the underlying distribution. In this MAB setup, we
develop sample-efficient algorithms that find, with high probability,
near-optimal arms within the given intervals, i.e., we obtain PAC (probably
approximately correct) guarantees. We also provide an algorithm for a
generalization wherein the weight of each point is a multi-dimensional vector.
The sample complexities of our algorithms depend, in particular, on the size of
the optimal hitting set of the given intervals.
  Finally, we establish lower bounds proving that the obtained sample
complexities are essentially tight. Our results highlight the significance of

emission states are seen. The durations of these states show a wide variety
ranging from several seconds to hours at a time. There are strong, small scale
magnetic field structures and huge temperature gradients present at the polar

assuming realistic scales of the temperature gradients, the evolutionary

estimated. We find that the Hall drift results in faster changes in comparison
to both Ohmic decay and thermoelectric effects. A mechanism based on the

investigate the spectra of plasmons generated in a solid by the optically
pumped electronic polarization and their effect on photoemission. By combining
quadratic response formalism for calculations of photoemission yield, a

Analogous concept is extrapolated to interpret plasmon generation by
multiphoton excited electronic polarization. Based on this we elaborate a

particularly critical since the demonstrations of severe flaws impacting the
integrity, confidentiality and accessibility of neural network models. However,
the attack surface of such embedded systems cannot be reduced to abstract flaws
but must encompass the physical threats related to the implementation of these
models within hardware platforms (e.g., 32-bit microcontrollers). Among
physical attacks, Fault Injection Analysis (FIA) are known to be very powerful
with a large spectrum of attack vectors. Most importantly, highly focused FIA
techniques such as laser beam injection enable very accurate evaluation of the
vulnerabilities as well as the robustness of embedded systems. Here, we propose
to discuss how laser injection with state-of-the-art equipment, combined with
theoretical evidences from Adversarial Machine Learning, highlights worrying
threats against the integrity of deep learning inference and claims that join
efforts from the theoretical AI and Physical Security communities are a urgent

coordinating inverter-based resources (IBR) with utility-owned voltage
regulators (VR) to regulate voltage in unbalanced 3-phase distribution systems.
First, correlations between nodal voltages are derived from nodal voltage
sensitivity studies. Then, the feeder is partitioned into non-overlapping,
weakly-coupled voltage control zones based on nodal voltage correlations. IBR
are used in the first stage to regulate voltage changes continuously and VR are
used in the second stage to regulate large voltage deviations. An online VR
voltage setpoint tuning strategy is developed to reduce excessive tap changes
and avoid large voltage fluctuations without retrofitting existing VR
controllers. In addition, the proposed algorithm uses real-time voltage
measurements only from the critical nodes (typically less than 4% of total
nodes) to reduce the sensing and communication needs. Actual distribution
feeder topologies and load and PV time-series data are used to verify the
performance of the algorithm. Because the method is a rule-based approach, it
runs extremely fast, requires fewer measurements, and requires no retrofit to
the existing VR control mechanisms. Simulation results show that the
performance of the proposed method in terms of voltage control results and
average numbers of VR tap changes are satisfactory.

somewhat limited pseudorandom functions families (PRFs) into ones with more
versatile characteristics. Consider the problem of \emph{domain extension} of
pseudorandom functions: given a PRF that takes as input elements of some domain
$U$, we would like to come up with a PRF over a larger domain. Can we do it
with little work and without significantly impacting the security of the
system? One approach is to first hash the larger domain into the smaller one
and then apply the original PRF. Such a reduction, however, is vulnerable to a
""birthday attack"": after $\sqrt{\size{U}}$ queries to the resulting PRF, a
collision (\ie two distinct inputs having the same hash value) is very likely
to occur. As a consequence, the resulting PRF is \emph{insecure} against an
attacker making this number of queries. In this work we show how to go beyond
the aforementioned birthday attack barrier by replacing the above simple
hashing approach with a variant of \textit{cuckoo hashing}, a hashing paradigm
that resolves collisions in a table by using two hash functions and two tables,
cleverly assigning each element to one of the two tables. We use this approach
to obtain: (i) a domain extension method that requires {\em just two calls} to
the original PRF, can withstand as many queries as the original domain size,
and has a distinguishing probability that is exponentially small in the amount
of non-cryptographic work; and (ii) a {\em security-preserving} reduction from
non-adaptive to adaptive PRFs.

underlie our conscious experiences has been at the forefront of cognitive
neuroscience. While the principles of classical physics were long found to be
unaccommodating for a causally effective consciousness, the inherent
indeterminism of quantum physics, together with its characteristic dichotomy
between quantum states and quantum observables, provides a fertile ground for
the physical modeling of consciousness. Here, we utilize the Schr\""odinger
equation, together with the Planck--Einstein relation between energy and
frequency, in order to determine the appropriate quantum dynamical timescale of
conscious processes. Furthermore, with the help of a simple two-qubit toy model
we illustrate the importance of non-zero interaction Hamiltonian for the
generation of quantum entanglement and manifestation of observable correlations
between different measurement outcomes. Employing a quantitative measure of
entanglement based on Schmidt decomposition, we show that quantum evolution
governed only by internal Hamiltonians for the individual quantum subsystems
preserves quantum coherence of separable initial quantum states, but eliminates
the possibility of any interaction and quantum entanglement. The presence of
non-zero interaction Hamiltonian, however, allows for decoherence of the
individual quantum subsystems along with their mutual interaction and quantum
entanglement. The presented results show that quantum coherence of individual
subsystems cannot be used for cognitive binding because it is a physical
mechanism that leads to separability and non-interaction. In contrast, quantum
interactions with their associated decoherence of individual subsystems are
instrumental for dynamical changes in the quantum entanglement of the composite
quantum state vector and manifested correlations of different observable

We have analyzed the data with a ro-vibrational diagram and a code which models
the absorption and emission of the circumstellar envelope of an AGB star. The
continuum is produced by the star with a small contribution from dust grains
comprising warm to hot SiC and cold amorphous carbon. The HCN abundance
distribution seems to be anisotropic. The ejected gas is accelerated up to the
terminal velocity (~8 km/s) from the photosphere to ~3R* but there is evidence
of higher velocities (>9-10 km/s) beyond this region. In the vicinity of Y CVn,
the line widths are as high as ~10 km/s, which implies a maximum turbulent
velocity of 6 km/s or the existence of other physical mechanisms probably
related to matter ejection that involve higher gas expansion velocities than
expected. HCN is rotationally and vibrationally out of LTE throughout the whole
envelope. A difference of about 1500 K in the rotational temperature at the
photosphere is needed to explain the observations at 7.5 and 13-14 um. Our
analysis finds a total HCN column density that ranges from ~2.1E+18 to 3.5E+18

an ordered pair $(S_v, T_v)$ of sets such that there is an edge from $v$ to $w$

if $S_v\cap T_v\neq \emptyset$ for every vertex $v$. Compared to well-known
undirected intersection graphs like interval graphs and permutation graphs, not

Motivated by the successful story on algorithmic applications of intersection
graphs using a graph width parameter called mim-width, we introduce its
directed analogue called `bi-mim-width' and prove that various classes of
reflexive intersection digraphs have bounded bi-mim-width. In particular, we
show that as a natural extension of $H$-graphs, reflexive $H$-digraphs have
linear bi-mim-width at most $12|E(H)|$, which extends a bound on the linear
mim-width of $H$-graphs [On the Tractability of Optimization Problems on
$H$-Graphs. Algorithmica 2020]. For applications, we introduce a novel
framework of directed versions of locally checkable problems, that streamlines
the definitions and the study of many problems in the literature and
facilitates their common algorithmic treatment. We obtain unified
polynomial-time algorithms for these problems on digraphs of bounded
bi-mim-width, when a branch decomposition is given. Locally checkable problems
include Kernel, Dominating Set, and Directed $H$-Homomorphism.

clients act strategically and heavily influence each other. This contrasts
established game-theoretic facility location models with non-strategic clients
that simply select the closest opened facility. In our model, every facility
location has a set of attracted clients and each client has a set of shopping
locations and a weight that corresponds to her spending capacity. Facility
agents selfishly select a location for opening their facility to maximize the
attracted total spending capacity, whereas clients strategically decide how to
distribute their spending capacity among the opened facilities in their
shopping range. We focus on a natural client behavior similar to classical load
balancing: our selfish clients aim for a distribution that minimizes their
maximum waiting times for getting serviced, where a facility's waiting time
corresponds to its total attracted client weight.
  We show that subgame perfect equilibria exist and give almost tight constant
bounds on the Price of Anarchy and the Price of Stability, which even hold for
a broader class of games with arbitrary client behavior. Since facilities and
clients influence each other, it is crucial for the facilities to anticipate
the selfish clients' behavior when selecting their location. For this, we
provide an efficient algorithm that also implies an efficient check for
equilibrium. Finally, we show that computing a socially optimal facility
placement is NP-hard and that this result holds for all feasible client weight
distributions.

Swiss Federal Railways, the so-called `supersaver tickets', based on machine
learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence. Considering a survey-based
sample of buyers of supersaver tickets, we investigate which customer- or
trip-related characteristics (including the discount rate) predict buying
behavior, namely: booking a trip otherwise not realized by train, buying a
first- rather than second-class ticket, or rescheduling a trip (e.g.\ away from
rush hours) when being offered a supersaver ticket. Predictive machine learning
suggests that customer's age, demand-related information for a specific
connection (like departure time and utilization), and the discount level permit
forecasting buying behavior to a certain extent. Furthermore, we use causal
machine learning to assess the impact of the discount rate on rescheduling a
trip, which seems relevant in the light of capacity constraints at rush hours.
Assuming that (i) the discount rate is quasi-random conditional on our rich set
of characteristics and (ii) the buying decision increases weakly monotonically
in the discount rate, we identify the discount rate's effect among `always
buyers', who would have traveled even without a discount, based on our survey
that asks about customer behavior in the absence of discounts. We find that on
average, increasing the discount rate by one percentage point increases the
share of rescheduled trips by 0.16 percentage points among always buyers.
Investigating effect heterogeneity across observables suggests that the effects
are higher for leisure travelers and during peak hours when controlling several
other characteristics.

conditions the QLE phase can be expected to hold in population biology and how
the stability of the QLE phase is lost. The QLE state, which has many
similarities to a thermal equilibrium state in statistical mechanics, was
discovered by M Kimura for a two-locus two-allele model, and was extended and
generalized to the global genome scale by (Neher and Shraiman, 2011). What we
will refer to as the Kimura-Neher-Shraiman (KNS) theory describes a population
evolving due to the mutations, recombination, natural selection and possibly
genetic drift. A QLE phase exists at sufficiently high recombination rate
and/or mutation rates with respect to selection strength. We show how in QLE it
is possible to infer the epistatic parameters of the fitness function from the
knowledge of the (dynamical) distribution of genotypes in a population. We
further consider the breakdown of the QLE regime for high enough selection
strength. We review recent results for the selection-mutation and
selection-recombination dynamics. Finally, we identify and characterize a new
phase which we call the non-random coexistence (NRC) where variability persists
in the population without either fixating or disappearing.

$J$ is a parabolic subgroup. Assume that $G$ is a classical group, $H$ is

Wuhan, China. Since that day, COVID-19 has spread worldwide, affecting 153
million people. Education, as many other sectors, has managed to adapt to the
requirements and barriers implied by the impossibility to teach students
face-to-face as it was done before. Yet, little is known about the implications
of emergency remote teaching (ERT) during the pandemic. This study describes
and analyzes the impact of the pandemic on the study patterns of higher
education students. The analysis was performed by the integration of three main
components: (1) interaction with the learning management system (LMS), (2)
Assignment submission rate, and (3) Teachers' perspective. Several variables
were created to analyze the study patterns, clicks on different LMS components,
usage during the day, week and part of the term, the time span of interaction
with the LMS, and grade categories. The results showed significant differences
in study patterns depending on the year of study, and the variables reflecting
the effect of teachers' changes in the course structure are identified. This
study outlines the first insights of higher education's new normality,
providing important implications for supporting teachers in creating academic
material that adequately addresses students' particular needs depending on
their year of study, changes in study pattern, and distribution of time and

efficiency of these model reduction methods is very convincing for problems
with a rapid decay of the Kolmogorov n-width, there are still major drawbacks

derive model reduction techniques that do not rely on a classical
offline/online splitting but allow for more flexibility in the usage of

reduction with adaptive enrichment. In this contribution we investigate
Petrov-Galerkin based model reduction with adaptive basis enrichment within a

momentum fraction $x_F$ greater than 0.9 and small transverse momentum. The
DDIS events, which can be identified with Pomeron exchange in the $t$-channel,
account for approximately $10\%$ of all of the DIS events. Thus, when one
measures DIS, one automatically includes the leading-twist Bjorken-scaling DDIS
events as a contribution to the DIS cross section, whether or not the
final-state proton $p'$ is detected. In such events, the missing momentum
fraction $x_{p'} \sim 0.9$ carried by the final-state proton $p'$ in the DDIS
events could be misidentified with the light-front momentum fraction carried by
sea quarks or gluons in the protons' Fock structure. As we shall show in this
article, the underlying QCD Pomeron-exchange amplitude which produces the DDIS
events does not obey the operator product expansion nor satisfy momentum sum
rules. Thus we conclude that the quark and gluon distributions measured in DIS
experiments will be misidentified, unless the measurements explicitly exclude
the DDIS events and that a correct determination of the parton distribution

the DDIS contribution from the full DIS cross section.

spur, which appears to be anticorrelated with the HI gas. We study the
properties of the hot interstellar medium (ISM) in the X-ray spur and
investigate its origin including related interactions in the ISM. Methods: We
analyzed new and archival XMM-Newton data of the X-ray spur and its
surroundings to determine the properties of the hot diffuse plasma. We created
detailed plasma property maps by utilizing the Voronoi tessellation algorithm.
We also studied HI and CO data, as well as optical line emission data of
H$\alpha$ and [SII], and compared them to the results of the X-ray spectral
analysis. Results: We find evidence of two hot plasma components with
temperatures of $kT_1 \sim 0.2$ keV and $kT_2 \sim 0.5-0.9$ keV, with the
hotter component being much more pronounced near 30 Dor and the X-ray spur. In
30 Dor, the plasma has most likely been heated by massive stellar winds and
supernova remnants. In the X-ray spur, we find no evidence of heating by stars.
Instead, the X-ray spur must have been compressed and heated by the collision
of the HI gas.

unambiguous, interpretation of the observed emission is the onset of a luminous
kilonova powered by a rapidly rotating and highly-magnetized neutron star,
known as magnetar. A bright radio flare, arising from the interaction of the
kilonova ejecta with the surrounding medium, is a prediction of this model.
Whereas the available dataset remains open to multiple interpretations (e.g.
afterglow, r-process kilonova, magnetar-powered kilonova), long-term radio
monitoring of this burst may be key to discriminate between models. We present
our late-time upper limit on the radio emission of GRB200522A, carried out with
the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 288 days after the burst. For kilonova
ejecta with energy $E_{\rm ej} \approx 10^{53} \rm erg$, as expected for a
long-lived magnetar remnant, we can already rule out ejecta masses $M_{\rm ej}
\lesssim0.03 \mathrm{M}_\odot$ for the most likely range of circumburst
densities $n\gtrsim 10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$. Observations on timescales of
$\approx$3-10 yr after the merger will probe larger ejecta masses up to $M_{\rm
ej} \sim 0.1 \mathrm{M}_\odot$, providing a robust test to the magnetar
scenario.

  How Much Overlap Is There?",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The advent of powerful prediction algorithms led to increased automation of
high-stake decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources such as
government spending and welfare support. This automation bears the risk of
perpetuating unwanted discrimination against vulnerable and historically
disadvantaged groups. Research on algorithmic discrimination in computer
science and other disciplines developed a plethora of fairness metrics to
detect and correct discriminatory algorithms. Drawing on robust sociological
and philosophical discourse on distributive justice, we identify the
limitations and problematic implications of prominent fairness metrics. We show
that metrics implementing equality of opportunity only apply when resource
allocations are based on deservingness, but fail when allocations should
reflect concerns about egalitarianism, sufficiency, and priority. We argue that
by cleanly distinguishing between prediction tasks and decision tasks, research
on fair machine learning could take better advantage of the rich literature on
distributive justice.

carried out with different acquisition protocols. Purpose: Investigate the
dependence of IVIM parameters on the B_0field strength when using a bi- or
triexponential model. Field Strength/Sequence: 20 volunteers were examined at
two field strengths (1.5 and 3T). Diffusion-weighted images of the abdomen were
acquired at 24 b-values ranging from 0.2 to 500 s/mm2. Assessment: ROIs were
manually drawn in the liver. Data were fitted with a bi- and a triexponential
IVIM model. Resulting parameters were compared between both field strengths.
Results: At b-values below 6s/mm2, the triexponential model provided better
agreement with the data than the biexponential model. The average tissue
diffusivity was D=1.22/1.00 um/ms at 1.5/3T. The average pseudo-diffusion
coefficients for the biexponential model were D*=308/260um/ms at 1.5/3T; and
for the triexponential model D1*=81.3/65.9um/ms , D2*=2453/2333um/ms at 1.5/3T.
The average perfusion fractions for the biexponential model were f=0.286/0.303
at 1.5/3T; and for the triexponential model f1=0.161/0.174 and f2=0.152/0.159
at 1.5/3T. A significant B0 dependence was only found for the biexponential
pseudo-diffusion coefficient (ANOVA/KW p=0.037/0.0453) and tissue diffusivity
(ANOVA/KW: p<0.001). Conclusion: Our experimental results suggest that
triexponential pseudo-diffusion coefficients and perfusion fractions obtained
at different field strengths could be compared across different studies using
different B0. However, it is recommendable to take the field strength into
account when comparing tissue diffusivities or using the biexponential IVIM
model. Considering published values for oxygenation-dependent transversal
relaxation times of blood, it is unlikely that the two blood compartments of
the triexponential model represent venous and arterial blood.

list of person or vehicle re-identification (re-ID), which boosts the retrieval
performance at post-processing steps. This paper proposes a re-ranking network
to predict the correlations between the probe and top-ranked neighbor samples.
Specifically, all the feature embeddings of query and gallery images are
expanded and enhanced by a linear combination of their neighbors, with the
correlation prediction serving as discriminative combination weights. The
combination process is equivalent to moving independent embeddings toward the
identity centers, improving cluster compactness. For correlation prediction, we
first aggregate the contextual information for probe's k-nearest neighbors via
the Transformer encoder. Then, we distill and refine the probe-related features
into the Contextual Memory cell via attention mechanism. Like humans that
retrieve images by not only considering probe images but also memorizing the
retrieved ones, the Contextual Memory produces multi-view descriptions for each
instance. Finally, the neighbors are reconstructed with features fetched from
the Contextual Memory, and a binary classifier predicts their correlations with
the probe. Experiments on six widely-used person and vehicle re-ID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Especially, our method
surpasses the state-of-the-art re-ranking approaches on large-scale datasets by

channel fading based key generation methods are not available. The mobility of
a spacecraft is modeled as the superposition of a pre-determined component and
a dynamic component. We derive the maximum achievable secret key generation
rate from the Doppler frequency shift. The proposed secret key generation
procedure extracts the Doppler frequency shift in the form of nominal power
spectral density samples (NPSDS). We propose a maximum-likelihood (ML)
estimation for the NPSDS at the spacecrafts, then a uniform quantizer is
utilized to obtain secret key bits. The key disagreement rate (KDR) is
analytically obtained for the proposed key generation procedure. Through
numerical studies, the tightness of the provided approximations is shown. Both

explaining the behavior of fluid flow after the onset of turbulence. While
perturbations in the velocity field have been shown to explain turbulent
transitions, a physical explanation of why flows become turbulent, based on the
forces felt by the fluid particles, has remained elusive. In this work a new
theory is proposed that attempts to explain the transition of fluid flow from
laminar to turbulent as explained by the fluid material undergoing failure. In
a vaguely similar sense to how fractures can occur in solids once the balance
of momentum exceeds the capacity of the material, so too in a fluid, after
sufficient kinetic energy has been achieved by a fluid packet, the viscous
forces are unable to maintain the laminar behavior and the fluid packets
receive a boost as the stored energy in the viscous bonds are transferred to
the kinetic energy of the fluid. This new model is described in terms of fluid
packets and the forces on a mass element and commonly-known turbulent flows are
used as examples to test the theory. Predicted flow profiles from the theory
match the experimental observations of averaged flow profiles and a new
equation to predict the onset of turbulence for any flow is presented. This
process of the fluid undergoing failure can be seen as a natural continuation
of the prevailing wisdom of turbulence when viewed from a different frame of
reference.

performance of lithographic equipment. However, position tracking accuracy of
high precision mechatronics is often limited by the presence of disturbance
sources, which originate from unmodelled or unforeseen deterministic
environmental effects. To negate the effects of these disturbances, a learning
based feedforward controller is employed, where the underlying control policy
is estimated from experimental data based on Gaussian Process regression. The
proposed approach exploits the property of including prior knowledge on the
expected steady state behaviour of residual dynamics in terms of kernel
selection. Corresponding hyper-parameters are optimized using the maximization
of the marginalized likelihood. Consequently, the learned function is employed
as augmentation of the currently employed rigid body feedforward controller.
The effectiveness of the augmentation is experimentally validated on a
magnetically levitated planar motor stage. The results of this paper
demonstrate the benefits and possibilities of machine-learning based approaches
for compensation of static effects, which originate from residual dynamics,
such that position tracking performance for moving-magnet planar motor

show that an above-median commuting distance in cities is associated with more

degree that distant commutes link neighborhoods of different socio-economic

above-median commutes are associated with a nearly uniform, moderate reduction

results inform policy that facilitating access across distant neighborhoods can

provides a self-reduction scheme that allows one to assume that a given
instance of a problem has a unique solution, provided a solution exists at all.
Since its introduction, much effort has been dedicated towards derandomization
of the Isolation Lemma for specific classes of problems. So far, the focus was
mainly on problems solvable in polynomial time.
  In this paper, we study a setting that is more typical for
$\mathsf{NP}$-complete problems, and obtain partial derandomizations in the
form of significantly decreasing the number of required random bits. In
particular, motivated by the advances in parameterized algorithms, we focus on
problems on decomposable graphs. For example, for the problem of detecting a
Hamiltonian cycle, we build upon the rank-based approach from [Bodlaender et
al., Inf. Comput.'15] and design isolation schemes that use
  - $O(t\log n + \log^2{n})$ random bits on graphs of treewidth at most $t$;
  - $O(\sqrt{n})$ random bits on planar or $H$-minor free graphs; and
  - $O(n)$-random bits on general graphs.
  In all these schemes, the weights are bounded exponentially in the number of
random bits used. As a corollary, for every fixed $H$ we obtain an algorithm
for detecting a Hamiltonian cycle in an $H$-minor-free graph that runs in
deterministic time $2^{O(\sqrt{n})}$ and uses polynomial space; this is the
first algorithm to achieve such complexity guarantees. For problems of more
local nature, such as finding an independent set of maximum size, we obtain
isolation schemes on graphs of treedepth at most $d$ that use $O(d)$ random
bits and assign polynomially-bounded weights.
  We also complement our findings with several unconditional and conditional
lower bounds, which show that many of the results cannot be significantly
improved.

Confined quantum systems have provided appreciable interest in areas of
physics, chemistry, biology,etc., since its inception. A particle under extreme
pressure environment unfolds many fascinating, notable physical and chemical
changes. The desired effect is achieved by reducing the spatial boundary from
infinity to a finite region. Similarly, in the last decade, information
measures were investigated extensively in diverse quantum problems, in both
free and constrained situations. The most prominent amongst these are: Fisher
information, Shannon entropy, Renyi entropy , Tsallis entropy, Onicescu energy
and several complexities. Arguably, these are the most effective measures of
uncertainty, as they do not make any reference to some specific points of a
respective Hilbert space. These have been invoked to explain several
physico-chemical properties of a system under investigation. Kullback-Leibler
divergence or relative entropy describes how a given probability distribution
shifts from a reference distribution function. This characterizes a measure of
discrimination between two states. In other words, it extracts the change of
information in going from one state to another.

lattice gas model to $S=1/2$ fermionic particles on the two-dimensional
triangular (hexagonal) lattice is analyzed. In such a model, each lattice site
can be occupied not by only one particle, but by two particles, which interact
with each other by onsite $U$ and intersite $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ (nearest and
next-nearest-neighbor, respectively) density-density interaction. The
investigated hamiltonian has a form of the extended Hubbard model in the atomic
limit (i.e., the zero-bandwidth limit). In the analysis of the phase diagrams
and thermodynamic properties of this model with repulsive $W_{1}>0$, the
variational approach is used, which treats the onsite interaction term exactly
and the intersite interactions within the mean-field approximation. The ground
state ($T=0$) diagram for $W_{2}\leq0$ as well as finite temperature ($T>0$)
phase diagrams for $W_{2}=0$ are presented. Two different types of charge order
within $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ unit cell can occur. At $T=0$, for $W_{2}=0$
phase separated states are degenerated with homogeneous phases (but $T>0$
removes this degeneration), whereas attractive $W_2<0$ stabilizes phase
separation at incommensurate fillings. For $U/W_{1}<0$ and $U/W_{1}>1/2$ only
the phase with two different concentrations occurs (together with two different
phase separated states occurring), whereas for small repulsive $0<U/W_{1}<1/2$
the other ordered phase also appears (with tree different concentrations in
sublattices). The qualitative differences with the model considered on
hypercubic lattices are also discussed.

transfer efficiency, $\beta$, is similar for different impact angles, however,
the imparted momentum is reduced as the impact angle decreases. It is expected
that the momentum imparted from a 45$^\circ$ impact is reduced by up to 50\%

anytime planner able to produce improved representations of planar maps as
graph costs and heuristics. Training occurs end-to-end on raw images with
direct supervision on planning examples, thanks to a differentiable A* solver
integrated into the architecture. More importantly, the user can trade off
planning accuracy for efficiency at run-time, using a single, real-valued
parameter. The solution suboptimality is constrained within a linear bound
equal to the optimal path cost multiplied by the tradeoff parameter. We
experimentally show the validity of our claims by testing Neural Weighted A*
against several baselines, introducing a novel, tile-based navigation dataset.
We outperform similar architectures in planning accuracy and efficiency.

derived from the electron polarization current, and (ii) the drift velocity
$u_e$ of the background plasma with respect to the EH, by considering

hypothesis tests has emerged that exploit the properties of heavy-tailed Stable
distributions. These methods offer important practical advantages including
robustness to dependence and better-than-Bonferroni scaleability, and they
reveal theoretical connections between Bayesian and classical hypothesis tests.
The harmonic mean $p$-value (HMP) procedure is based on the convergence of
summed inverse $p$-values to the Landau distribution, while the Cauchy
combination test (CCT) is based on the self-similarity of summed
Cauchy-transformed $p$-values. The CCT has the advantage that it is analytic
and exact. The HMP has the advantage that it emulates a model-averaged Bayes
factor, is insensitive to $p$-values near 1, and offers multilevel testing via
a closed testing procedure. Here I investigate whether other Stable combination
tests can combine these benefits, and identify a new method, the L\'evy
combination test (LCT). The LCT exploits the self-similarity of sums of L\'evy
random variables transformed from $p$-values. Under arbitrary dependence, the
LCT possesses better robustness than the CCT and HMP, with two-fold worst-case
inflation at small significance thresholds. It controls the strong-sense
familywise error rate through a multilevel test uniformly more powerful than
Bonferroni. Simulations show that the LCT behaves like Simes' test in some
respects, with power intermediate between the HMP and Bonferroni. The LCT
represents an interesting and attractive addition to combined testing methods

We calculate the mass spectrum from the axion fluctuation in this gravity

orders of mass, we derive the analytical expressions of the mass spectrum of
$0^{-+}$ at the finite temperature. Finally we evaluate the masses numerically
as $m_{-+}=2.5$GeV and $m_{-+}^*=3.8$GeV from the complete WKB equation. The
mass of a given state is found to decrease with increasing temperature and
becomes zero at confinement -deconfinement transition temperature which is
consistent with the idea of deconfinement and also matches with some recent
lattice results. From this temperature variation, the QCD transition point is
found to be about $186$MeV.

to propose a notion of smoothness in tropical geometry, which goes beyond
matroids and their Bergman fans and which leads to an enrichment of the
category of smooth tropical varieties.
  Among the resulting applications, we prove the Hodge isomorphism theorem
which asserts that the Chow rings of smooth unimodular tropical fans are
isomorphic to the tropical cohomology rings of their corresponding canonical
compactifications, and prove a slightly weaker statement for any unimodular
fan. We furthermore introduce a notion of shellability for tropical fans and
show that shellable tropical fans are smooth and thus enjoy all the nice
homological properties of smooth tropical fans. Several other interesting
properties for tropical fans are shown to be shellable. Finally, we obtain a
generalization, both in the tropical and in the classical setting, of the
pioneering work of Feichtner-Yuzvinsky and De Concini-Procesi on the cohomology
ring of wonderful compactifications of complements of hyperplane arrangements.

intersect at a single party. Each broadcast link suffers from random bit-flip
noise that affects the receivers independently. We design interactive coding
schemes that successfully perform any computation over these noisy networks and
strive to reduce their communication overhead with respect to the original
(noiseless) computation.
  A simple variant of a coding scheme by Rajagopalan and Schulman (STOC 1994)
shows that any (noiseless) protocol of $R$ rounds can be reliably simulated in
$O(R\log n)$ rounds over a network with $n=n_1n_2+1$ parties in which a single
party is connected to $n_2$ noisy broadcast channels, each of which connects
$n_1$ distinct parties. We design new coding schemes with improved overheads.
Our approach divides the network into four regimes according to the
relationship between $n_1$ and $n_2$. We employ a two-layer coding where the
inner code protects each broadcast channel and is tailored to the specific
conditions of the regime in consideration. The outer layer protects the
computation in the network and is generally based on the scheme of Rajagopalan
and Schulman, adapted to the case of broadcast channels. The overhead we obtain
ranges from $O(\log\log n_2)$ to $O(\log n_2 \frac{\log\log n_1}{\log n_1})$

spherocylindrical particles that interact via frictional forces with friction
coefficient $\mu$. The packings are produced and deformed with the help of
molecular dynamics simulations combined with minimization techniques performed
on a GPU. We calculate the linear shear modulus $g_\infty$, which is orders of
magnitude larger than the modulus $g_0$ in the corresponding frictionless
system. The motion of the particles responsible for these large frictional
forces is governed by and increases with the length $\ell$ of the
spherocylinders. One consequence of this motion is that the shear modulus
$g_\infty$ approaches a finite value in the limit $\ell\to\infty$, even though
the density of the packings vanishes, $\rho\propto\ell^{-2}$. By way of
contrast, the frictionless modulus decreases to zero, $g_0\sim\ell^{-2}$, in
accordance with the behavior of density. Increasing the strain beyond a value
$\gamma_c\sim \mu$, the packing undergoes a ""shear-thinning"" transition from
the large frictional to the smaller frictionless modulus when contacts saturate
at the Coulomb inequality and start to slide. In this regime, sliding friction
contributes a ""yield stress"" $\sigma_y=g_\infty\gamma_c$ and the stress behaves
as $\sigma=\sigma_y+g_0\gamma$. The interplay between static and sliding
friction gives rise to hysteresis in oscillatory shear simulations.

to 330 au) the HC HII region inside molecular core A1 of the high-mass
star-forming cluster G24.78+0.08. We used the H30alpha emission and different
molecular lines of CH3CN and 13CH3CN to study the kinematics of the ionized and
molecular gas, respectively. At the center of the HC HII region, at radii <~500
au, we observe two mutually perpendicular velocity gradients, which are
directed along the axes at PA = 39 deg and PA = 133 deg, respectively. The
velocity gradient directed along the axis at PA = 39 deg has an amplitude of 22
km/s mpc^(-1), which is much larger than the other's, 3 km/s mpc^(-1). We
interpret these velocity gradients as rotation around, and expansion along, the
axis at PA = 39 deg. We propose a scenario where the H30alpha line traces the
ionized heart of a disk-jet system that drives the formation of the massive
star (~20 M_sun) responsible for the HC HII region. Such a scenario is also
supported by the position-velocity plots of the CH3CN and 13CH3CN lines along
the axis at PA = 133 deg, which are consistent with Keplerian rotation around a
20 M_sun star. Toward the HC HII region in G24.78+0.08, the coexistence of mass
infall (at radii of ~5000 au), an outer molecular disk (from <~4000 au to >~500
au), and an inner ionized disk (<~500 au) indicates that the massive ionizing
star is still actively accreting from its parental molecular core. To our
knowledge, this is the first example of a molecular disk around a high-mass
forming star that, while becoming internally ionized after the onset of the HII
region, continues to accrete mass onto the ionizing star.

freedom, commonly labeled plus and cross. Besides those two tensor modes,
generic theories of gravity predict up to four additional polarization modes:
two scalar and two vector. Detection of nontensorial modes in gravitational
wave data would constitute a clean signature of physics beyond general
relativity. Previous measurements have pointed to the unambiguous presence of
tensor modes in gravitational waves, but the presence of additional generic
nontensorial modes has not been directly tested. We propose a model-independent
analysis capable of detecting and characterizing mixed tensor and nontensor
components in transient gravitational wave signals, including those from
compact binary coalescences. This infrastructure can constrain the presence of
scalar or vector polarization modes on top of the tensor modes predicted by
general relativity. Our analysis is morphology-independent (as it does not rely
on a waveform templates), phase-coherent, and agnostic about the source sky
location. We apply our analysis to data from GW190521 and simulated data and
demonstrate that it is capable of placing upper limits on the strength of
nontensorial modes when none are present, or characterizing their morphology in
the case of a positive detection. Tests of the polarization content of a
transient gravitational wave signal hinge on an extended detector network,
wherein each detector observes a different linear combination of polarization
modes. We therefore anticipate that our analysis will yield precise
polarization constraints in the coming years, as the current ground-based

implementation on an ultra-low-power microcontroller (MCU) in mind. The
detection accuracy of the developed algorithm is tested against points manually
labeled by cardiologists. It achieves a detection Gmean accuracy of 94.9%,
98.6%, 90.3%, and 84.3% for the B, C, X, and O points, respectively.
Furthermore, several hemodynamic parameters were calculated based on annotated

characteristics offered by an electromagnetic channel and ultimately approaches

Holographic MIMO communications. Accurate and tractable channel modeling is
critical to understanding its full potential. Classical stochastic models used
by communications theorists are derived under the electromagnetic far-field

wavelength) antenna arrays are considered. In this paper, we start from the
first principles of wave propagation and provide a Fourier plane-wave series
expansion of the channel response, which fully captures the essence of
electromagnetic propagation in arbitrary scattering and is also valid in the
(radiative) near-field. The expansion is based on the Fourier spectral
representation and has an intuitive physical interpretation, as it
statistically describes the angular coupling between source and receiver. When
discretized uniformly, it leads to a low-rank semi-unitarily equivalent
approximation of the electromagnetic channel in the angular domain. The
developed channel model is used to compute the ergodic capacity of a

according to the mass of an organism. Empirical evidence suggests a power-law
relation between mass and metabolic rate, namely allometric law. For vascular
organisms, the exponent $\beta$ of this power-law is smaller than one, which
implies scaling economy; that is, the greater the organism is, the lesser
energy per cell it demands. However, the numerical value of this exponent is a

antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) -- can be tuned by the radius of
the rare-earth element. Here, we combine phenomenology and first-principles
calculations to shed light on the generic magnetic phase diagram of a
chemically substituted titanate on the rare-earth site that interpolates
between an AFM and a FM state. Octahedral rotations present in these
perovskites cause the AFM order to acquire a small FM component -- and
vice-versa -- removing any multicritical point from the phase diagram. However,
for a wide parameter range, a first-order metamagnetic transition line
terminating at a critical endpoint survives inside the magnetically ordered
phase. Like the liquid-gas transition, a Widom line emerges from the endpoint,
characterized by enhanced fluctuations. In contrast to metallic FMs, this
metamagnetic transition involves two symmetry-equivalent and insulating canted
spin states. Moreover, instead of a magnetic field, we show that uniaxial
strain can be used to tune this transition to zero temperature, inducing a
quantum critical endpoint.

mechanisms. While classical poisoning attacks typically corrupt data via
addition, modification and omission, our attack focuses on data omission only.
Our attack misclassifies a single, targeted test sample of choice, without
manipulating that sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of omission attacks
against a large variety of learners including deep neural networks, SVM and
decision trees, using several datasets including MNIST, IMDB and CIFAR. The
focus of our attack on data omission only is beneficial as well, as it is
simpler to implement and analyze. We show that, with a low attack budget, our
attack's success rate is above 80%, and in some cases 100%, for white-box
learning. It is systematically above the reference benchmark for black-box
learning. For both white-box and black-box cases, changes in model accuracy are
negligible, regardless of the specific learner and dataset. We also prove
theoretically in a simplified agnostic PAC learning framework that, subject to
dataset size and distribution, our omission attack succeeds with high
probability against any successful simplified agnostic PAC learner.

imaging and spectroscopy. Its nonlinear character allows for the prospect of
using quantum resources, such as entanglement, to improve measurement precision
or to gain new information on, e.g., ultrafast molecular dynamics. Here, we
establish the metrological properties of nonclassical squeezed light sources
for precision measurements of TPA cross sections. We find that there is no
fundamental limit for the precision achievable with squeezed states in the
limit of very small cross sections. Considering the most relevant measurement
strategies -- namely photon counting and quadrature measurements -- we
determine the quantum advantage provided by squeezed states as compared to
coherent states. We find that squeezed states outperform the precision
achievable by coherent states when performing quadrature measurements, which
provide improved scaling of the Fisher information with respect to the mean
photon number $\sim n^4$. Due to the interplay of the incoherent nature and the
nonlinearity of the TPA process, unusual scaling can also be obtained with
coherent states, which feature a $\sim n^3$ scaling in both quadrature and
photon-counting measurements.

  relational hyperevent models for the analysis of coauthor networks",,,"10.1017/nws.2022.29",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss a recently proposed family of statistical network models -
relational hyperevent models (RHEM) - for analyzing team selection and team
performance in scientific coauthor networks. The underlying rationale for using
RHEM in studies of coauthor networks is that scientific collaboration is
intrinsically polyadic, that is, it typically involves teams of any size.
Consequently, RHEM specify publication rates associated with hyperedges
representing groups of scientists of any size. Going beyond previous work on
RHEM for meeting data, we adapt this model family to settings in which
relational hyperevents have a dedicated outcome, such as a scientific paper
with a measurable impact (e.g., the received number of citations). Relational
outcome can on the one hand be used to specify additional explanatory variables
in RHEM since the probability of coauthoring may be influenced, for instance,
by prior (shared) success of scientists. On the other hand relational outcome
can also serve as a response variable in models seeking to explain the
performance of scientific teams. To tackle the latter we propose relational
hyperevent outcome models (RHOM) that are closely related with RHEM to the
point that both model families can specify the likelihood of scientific
collaboration - and the expected performance, respectively - with the same set
of explanatory variables allowing to assess, for instance, whether variables
leading to increased collaboration also tend to increase scientific impact. For
illustration, we apply RHEM to empirical coauthor networks comprising more than
350,000 published papers by scientists working in three scientific disciplines.

second-order features, i.e., joint and bone representations, has led to high
accuracy. Nonetheless, many models are still confused by actions that have
similar motion trajectories. To address these issues, we propose fusing
higher-order features in the form of angular encoding into modern architectures
to robustly capture the relationships between joints and body parts. This
simple fusion with popular spatial-temporal graph neural networks achieves new
state-of-the-art accuracy in two large benchmarks, including NTU60 and NTU120,
while employing fewer parameters and reduced run time. Our source code is

of novel ways to enhance buyer experience via improved personalization.
Predicting a proper size for an item to recommend is an important
personalization challenge, and is being studied in this work. Earlier works in
this field either focused on modeling explicit buyer fitment feedback or
modeling of only a single aspect of the problem (e.g., specific category,
brand, etc.). More recent works proposed richer models, either content-based or
sequence-based, better accounting for content-based aspects of the problem or
better modeling the buyer's online journey. However, both these approaches fail
in certain scenarios: either when encountering unseen items (sequence-based
models) or when encountering new users (content-based models).
  To address the aforementioned gaps, we propose PreSizE - a novel deep
learning framework which utilizes Transformers for accurate size prediction.
PreSizE models the effect of both content-based attributes, such as brand and
category, and the buyer's purchase history on her size preferences. Using an
extensive set of experiments on a large-scale e-commerce dataset, we
demonstrate that PreSizE is capable of achieving superior prediction
performance compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines. By encoding item
attributes, PreSizE better handles cold-start cases with unseen items, and
cases where buyers have little past purchase data. As a proof of concept, we
demonstrate that size predictions made by PreSizE can be effectively integrated
into an existing production recommender system yielding very effective features
and significantly improving recommendations.

matrix of a multivariate Gaussian model with known mean should be considered to
be a constant diagonal, a non-constant diagonal, or an arbitrary positive

evidence and the flexibility penalty due to Priebe and Rougier. For the case of
an exponential family in canonical form equipped with a conjugate prior for the
canonical parameter, flexibility may be exactly decomposed into the usual BIC
likelihood penalty and a $O_p(1)$ term, the latter of which we explicitly
compute. We also investigate the asymptotics of Bayes factors for linearly
nested canonical exponential families equipped with conjugate priors; in
particular, we find the exact rates at which Bayes factors correctly diverge in
favor of the correct model: linearly and logarithmically in the number of
observations when the full and nested models are true, respectively. Such
theoretical considerations for the general case permit us to fully express the
asymptotic behavior of flexibility and Bayes factors for the
variance-covariance structure selection problem when we assume that the prior
for the model precision is a member of the gamma/Wishart family of
distributions or is uninformative. Simulations demonstrate evidence's immediate
and superior performance in model selection compared to approximate criteria

for decisions requiring a high level of trust. For regression methods, trust is
increased if they approximate the true input-output relationships and perform
accurately outside the bounds of the training data. But often performance
off-test-set is poor, especially when data is sparse. This is because the
conditional average, which in many scenarios is a good approximation of the
`ground truth', is only modelled with conventional Minkowski-r error measures
when the data set adheres to restrictive assumptions, with many real data sets
violating these. To combat this there are several methods that use prior
knowledge to approximate the `ground truth'. However, prior knowledge is not
always available, and this paper investigates how error measures affect the
ability for a regression method to model the `ground truth' in these scenarios.
Current error measures are shown to create an unhelpful bias and a new error
measure is derived which does not exhibit this behaviour. This is tested on 36
representative data sets with different characteristics, showing that it is
more consistent in determining the `ground truth' and in giving improved
predictions in regions beyond the range of the training data.

probability measures from computational and statistical sides. The statistical
focus is estimating the sample size of measures necessary to calculate an
approximation for Fr\'echet mean (barycenter) of a probability distribution
with a given precision. For empirical risk minimization approaches, the
question of the regularization is also studied together with proposing a new
regularization which contributes to the better complexity bounds in comparison
with quadratic regularization. The computational focus is developing algorithms
for calculating Wasserstein barycenters: both primal and dual algorithms which
can be executed in a decentralized manner. The motivation for dual approaches
is closed-forms for the dual formulation of entropy-regularized Wasserstein
distances and their derivatives, whereas the primal formulation has closed-form
expression only in some cases, e.g., for Gaussian measures. Moreover, the dual
oracle returning the gradient of the dual representation for
entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance can be computed for a cheaper price in
comparison with the primal oracle returning the gradient of the
entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance. The number of dual oracle calls, in

coupled flows of matter, energy, and information. Here, using entropy
production as an example, we show how thermodynamic uncertainty relations and
speed limits on these nonlinear processes derive from linear regression. These
uncertainty relations hold for both passive and actively-driven nonequilibrium
processes and all have a mathematical form that mirrors uncertainty relations
in quantum mechanics. Using optimal linear models, we show that
information-theoretic variables naturally give physical predictions of the
equation of motion on statistical manifolds in terms of physical observables.
In these models, optimal intercepts are related to nonequilibrium analogs of
Massieu functions/thermodynamic potentials, and optimal slopes are related to
speed limits on collections of thermodynamic observables. Within this
formalism, the second law of thermodynamics has a geometric interpretation as
the nonnegativity of the slope and constrains the equation of motion. Overall,
our results suggest that unknown relationships between nonequilibrium variables
can be learned through statistical-mechanical inference.

compared our community detection results to actual major specializations within
the computer science department and found strong similarities. To compliment
this analysis, we also used directed networks to identify the ""typical""

that course choices diversify as programs progress, meaning that attempting to
understand course choices by identifying a ""typical"" student gives less insight

adopt a three-dimensional (3-D) system model with multiple independent and

link between the modelled variables in TKTD models and the observations from
laboratory ecotoxicity tests. For the endpoint reproduction, this link is far
from trivial. The relevant TKTD models for sub-lethal effects are based on
Dynamic-Energy Budget (DEB) theory, which specifies a continuous investment
flux into reproduction. In contrast, experimental tests score egg or offspring
release by the mother. The link between model and data is particularly
troublesome when a species reproduces in discrete clutches, and even more so
when eggs are incubated in the mother's brood pouch (and release of neonates is
scored in the test). This situation is quite common among aquatic invertebrates

learning (ML) has been developed actively in the last years in IIoT to identify
patterns in heterogeneous data streams and fuse raw data into tangible facts.
In a traditional compute-centric paradigm, the raw field data are continuously
sent to the cloud and processed centrally. As IIoT devices become increasingly
pervasive and ubiquitous, concerns are raised since transmitting such amount of
data is energy-intensive, vulnerable to be intercepted, and subjected to high
latency. The data-centric paradigm can essentially solve these problems by
empowering IIoT to perform decentralized on-device ML and CEP, keeping data
primarily on edge devices and minimizing communications. However, this is no
mean feat because most IIoT edge devices are designed to be computationally
constrained with low power consumption. This paper proposes a framework that
exploits ML and CEP's synergy at the edge in distributed sensor networks. By
leveraging tiny ML and micro CEP, we shift the computation from the cloud to

nanotechnology is employed as an unprecedented tool to create nanophotonic
devices with excellent spatial addressability and temporal programmability.
However, most of the current DNA-assembled nanophotonic devices can only
reconfigure among random or very few defined states. Here, we demonstrate a
DNA-assembled rotary plasmonic nanoclock. In this system, a rotor gold nanorod
can carry out directional and reversible 360 degree rotation with respect to a
stator gold nanorod, transitioning among 16 well-defined configurations powered
by DNA fuels. The full-turn rotation process is monitored by optical
spectroscopy in real time. We further demonstrate autonomous rotation of the
plasmonic nanoclock powered by DNAzyme-RNA interactions. Such assembly
approaches pave a viable route towards advanced nanophotonic systems entirely

thicknesses cadmium selenide colloidal nanoplatelets is investigated using
resonant low frequency Raman scattering. The strong vibration frequency shifts
induced by ligand modifications as well as the sharp spectral linewidths make
low frequency Raman scattering a tool of choice to follow ligand exchange as
well as the nano-mechanical properties of the NPLs, as evidenced by a
carboxylate to thiolate exchange study. Apart from their molecular weight, the
nature of the ligands, such as the sulfur to metal bond of thiols, induces a
modification of the NPLs as a whole, increasing the thickness by one monolayer.
Moreover, as the weight of the ligands increases, the discrepancy between the
massload model and the experimental measurements increase. These effects are
all the more important when the number of layers is small and can only be
explained by a modification of the longitudinal sound velocity. This
modification takes its origin in a change of lattice structure of the NPLs,
that reflects on its elastic properties. These nanobalances are finally used to
characterize ligands affinity with the surface using binary thiols mixtures,
illustrating the potential of low frequency Raman scattering to finely
characterize nanocrystals surfaces.

time. We address key challenges towards making GR feasible, sound, and
practical to use. The resultant replayer is a drop-in replacement of the
original GPU stack. It is tiny (50 KB of executable), robust (replaying long
executions without divergence), portable (running in a commodity OS, in TEE,
and baremetal), and quick to launch (speeding up startup by up to two orders of
magnitude). We show that GPUReplay works with a variety of integrated GPU

one candidate summed an excess of 4096 votes. An accurate analysis led to the
official explanation that a spontaneous creation of a bit in position 13 of the
memory of the computer attributed 4096 extra votes to one candidate. One of the
most credited answers to this event is attributed to cosmic rays i.e.(gamma),
which can filter through the atmosphere. There are cases though, with classical
computers, like forensic investigations, or system recovery where such
soft-errors may be helpful to gain root privileges and recover data. In this
paper we show preliminary results of using radioactive sources as a mean to
generate bit-flips and exploit classical electronic computation devices. We
used low radioactive emissions generated by Cobalt and Cesium and obtained
bit-flips which made the program under attack crash. We also provide the first
overview of the consequences of SEUs in quantum computers which are today used
in production for protein folding optimization, showing potential impactful
consequences. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to leverage SEUs
for exploitation purposes which could be of great impact on classical and

feature the integration of various shared-use mobility options, have gained
widespread popularity in recent years. While these concepts promise great
benefits to travelers, their heavy reliance on technology raises equity
concerns as socially disadvantaged population groups can be left out in an era
of on-demand mobility. This paper investigates the potential uptake of MOD
transit services (integrated fixed-route and on-demand services) among
travelers living in low-income communities. Specially, we analyze people's
latent attitude towards three shared-use mobility services, including
ride-hailing services, fixed-route transit, and MOD transit. We conduct a
latent class cluster analysis of 825 survey respondents sampled from low-income
neighborhoods in Detroit and Ypsilanti, Michigan. We identified three latent
segments: shared-mode enthusiast, shared-mode opponent, and fixed-route transit
loyalist. People from the shared-mode enthusiast segment often use ride-hailing
services and live in areas with poor transit access, and they are likely to be
the early adopters of MOD transit services. The shared-mode opponent segment
mainly includes vehicle owners who lack interests in shared mobility options.
The fixed-route transit loyalist segment includes a considerable share of
low-income individuals who face technological barriers to use the MOD transit.
We also find that males, college graduates, car owners, people with a mobile
data plan, and people living in poor-transit-access areas have a higher level
of preferences for MOD transit services. We conclude with policy
recommendations for developing more accessible and equitable MOD transit
services.
