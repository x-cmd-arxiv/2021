problems that occur in the design process of semiconductor package substrates.
Our work uses a topological transformation of the layers of the package
substrate in order to simplify the routing problem into a problem of connecting
points on a circle with non-intersecting straight line segments. The circle,
which we call the Circular Frame, is a polygonal schema, which is originally
used in topology to study the topological structure of 2-manifolds. We show
through experiments that our new routing method based on the Circular Frame
competes with certain grid-based routing algorithms.

many of the features that the emergent gauge field of spin ice confers to the
macroscopic magnetic properties are preserved in spite of the finite
temperature. The magnetisation vs. field shows an upward convexity within a
broad range of fields, while the static and dynamic susceptibilities present a
peculiar peak. Following this feature for both compounds, we determine a single
experimental transition curve: that for the Kasteleyn transition in three
dimensions, proposed more than a decade ago. Additionally, we observe that
compression up to $-0.8\%$ along [001] does not significantly change the
thermodynamics. However, the dynamical response of Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is quite
sensitive to changes introduced in the ${\rm Ho}^{3+}$ environment. Uniaxial
compression can thus open up experimental access to equilibrium properties of
spin ice at low temperatures.

alternative approach for data recovery in fiber transmission systems. Photonic
reservoir computing, performing nonlinear transformations of the transmitted

this kind of processing. In this work, we show that the effectiveness of the
internal fading memory depends significantly on the properties of the signal to
be processed. Specifically, we demonstrate two experimental photonic
post-processing schemes for a 56 GBaud PAM-4 experimental transmission system,
with 100 km uncompensated standard single-mode fiber and direct detection. We
show that, for transmission systems with significant chromatic dispersion, the
contribution of a photonic reservoir's fading memory to the computational
performance is limited. In a comparison between the data recovery performances
between a reservoir computing and an extreme learning machine fiber-based
configuration, we find that both offer equivalent data recovery. The extreme
learning machine approach eliminates the necessity of external recurrent
connectivity, which simplifies the system and increases the computation speed.

  Squares",,,,,"cs.CG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A well-established theoretical model for modular robots in two dimensions are
edge-connected configurations of square modules, which can reconfigure through
so-called sliding moves. Dumitrescu and Pach [Graphs and Combinatorics, 2006]
proved that it is always possible to reconfigure one edge-connected
configuration of $n$ squares into any other using at most $O(n^2)$ sliding
moves, while keeping the configuration connected at all times.
  For certain pairs of configurations, reconfiguration may require
$\Omega(n^2)$ sliding moves. However, significantly fewer moves may be
sufficient. We prove that it is NP-hard to minimize the number of sliding moves
for a given pair of edge-connected configurations. On the positive side we
present Gather&Compact, an input-sensitive in-place algorithm that requires
only $O(\bar{P} n)$ sliding moves to transform one configuration into the
other, where $\bar{P}$ is the maximum perimeter of the two bounding boxes. The
squares move within the bounding boxes only, with the exception of at most one
square at a time which may move through the positions adjacent to the bounding
boxes. The $O(\bar{P} n)$ bound never exceeds $O(n^2)$, and is optimal (up to
constant factors) among all bounds parameterized by just $n$ and $\bar{P}$. Our
algorithm is built on the basic principle that well-connected components of
modular robots can be transformed efficiently. Hence we iteratively increase
the connectivity within a configuration, to finally arrive at a single solid
$xy$-monotone component.
  We implemented Gather&Compact and compared it experimentally to the in-place
modification by Moreno and Sacrist\'an [EuroCG 2020] of the Dumitrescu and Pach
algorithm (MSDP). Our experiments show that Gather&Compact consistently
outperforms MSDP by a significant margin, on all types of square
configurations.

$K\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, given access to $A\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$, which can
be viewed as a data matrix with $n$ points that are obtained by randomly
perturbing latent points in the simplex $K$ (potentially beyond $K$). A large
class of latent variable models, such as adversarial clustering, mixed
membership stochastic block models, and topic models can be cast as learning a
latent simplex. Bhattacharyya and Kannan (SODA, 2020) give an algorithm for
learning such a latent simplex in time roughly $O(k\cdot\textrm{nnz}(A))$,
where $\textrm{nnz}(A)$ is the number of non-zeros in $A$. We show that the
dependence on $k$ in the running time is unnecessary given a natural assumption
about the mass of the top $k$ singular values of $A$, which holds in many of
these applications. Further, we show this assumption is necessary, as otherwise
an algorithm for learning a latent simplex would imply an algorithmic
breakthrough for spectral low rank approximation.
  At a high level, Bhattacharyya and Kannan provide an adaptive algorithm that
makes $k$ matrix-vector product queries to $A$ and each query is a function of
all queries preceding it. Since each matrix-vector product requires
$\textrm{nnz}(A)$ time, their overall running time appears unavoidable.
Instead, we obtain a low-rank approximation to $A$ in input-sparsity time and
show that the column space thus obtained has small $\sin\Theta$ (angular)
distance to the right top-$k$ singular space of $A$. Our algorithm then selects
$k$ points in the low-rank subspace with the largest inner product with $k$
carefully chosen random vectors. By working in the low-rank subspace, we avoid
reading the entire matrix in each iteration and thus circumvent the
$\Theta(k\cdot\textrm{nnz}(A))$ running time.

societies to reveal the evolution of kinship structures. In the model, several
societies compete. Societies themselves comprise multiple families with
parameters for cultural traits and mate preferences. These values determine
with whom each family cooperates and competes and are transmitted to a new
generation with mutation. The growth rate of each family is determined by the
number of cooperators and competitors. Through this multi-level evolution,
family traits and preferences diverge to form clusters that can be regarded as
clans. Subsequently, kinship structures emerge, including dual organisation and
generalised or restricted exchange, as well as patrilineal, matrilineal, and
double descent systems. These structures emerge depending on the necessity of
cooperation and the strength of mating competition. Their dependence is also
estimated analytically. Finally, statistical analysis using the Standard

velocities and the lower level energies of the transitions, which could be a
signature of temperature-velocity gradients in the absorbing gas. As a result,
we do not find evidence for variations of mu, and we estimate Dmu/mu = (-1.8

generated by unitary interactions round-a-face (IRF). Specifically, we discuss
a set (or manifold) of dual-unitary IRFs with local Hilbert space dimension $d$
(DUIRF$(d)$) which generate unitary evolutions both in space and time
directions of an extended 1+1 dimensional lattice. We show how arbitrary
dynamical correlation functions of local observables can be evaluated in terms
of finite dimensional completely positive trace preserving unital maps, in
complete analogy to recently studied circuits made of dual unitary brick gates

non-trivially supported on at least two sites. We completely characterise the
10-dimensional manifold of DUIRF$(2)$ for qubits ($d=2$) and provide, for
$d=3,4,5,6,7$, empirical estimates of its dimensionality based on numerically
determined dimensions of tangent spaces at an ensemble of random instances of

${\rm dim}\,{\rm DUBG}(d)$ and show that they are of similar order though
systematically larger than ${\rm dim}\,{\rm DUIRF}(d)$ for $d=2,3,4,5,6,7$. It
is remarkable that both sets have rather complex topology for $d\ge 3$ in the
sense that the dimension of the tangent space varies among different randomly
generated points of the set. Finally, we provide additional data on
dimensionality of the chiral extension of DUBG circuits with distinct local

  Dependence of Decentralized SGD",,,,,"math.OC cs.DC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the decentralized stochastic optimization problems, where a
network of $n$ nodes, each owning a local cost function, cooperate to find a
minimizer of the globally-averaged cost. A widely studied decentralized
algorithm for this problem is decentralized SGD (D-SGD), in which each node
averages only with its neighbors. D-SGD is efficient in single-iteration
communication, but it is very sensitive to the network topology. For smooth
objective functions, the transient stage (which measures the number of
iterations the algorithm has to experience before achieving the linear speedup
stage) of D-SGD is on the order of ${\Omega}(n/(1-\beta)^2)$ and
$\Omega(n^3/(1-\beta)^4)$ for strongly and generally convex cost functions,
respectively, where $1-\beta \in (0,1)$ is a topology-dependent quantity that
approaches $0$ for a large and sparse network. Hence, D-SGD suffers from slow
convergence for large and sparse networks.
  In this work, we study the non-asymptotic convergence property of the
D$^2$/Exact-diffusion algorithm. By eliminating the influence of data
heterogeneity between nodes, D$^2$/Exact-diffusion is shown to have an enhanced
transient stage that is on the order of $\tilde{\Omega}(n/(1-\beta))$ and
$\Omega(n^3/(1-\beta)^2)$ for strongly and generally convex cost functions,
respectively. Moreover, when D$^2$/Exact-diffusion is implemented with gradient
accumulation and multi-round gossip communications, its transient stage can be
further improved to $\tilde{\Omega}(1/(1-\beta)^{\frac{1}{2}})$ and
$\tilde{\Omega}(n/(1-\beta))$ for strongly and generally convex cost functions,
respectively. These established results for D$^2$/Exact-Diffusion have the best
(i.e., weakest) dependence on network topology to our knowledge compared to
existing decentralized algorithms. We also conduct numerical simulations to
validate our theories.

role in enabling sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL). The current
paper pertains to a scenario with value-based linear representation, which
postulates the linear realizability of the optimal Q-function (also called the
""linear $Q^{\star}$ problem""). While linear realizability alone does not allow
for sample-efficient solutions in general, the presence of a large
sub-optimality gap is a potential game changer, depending on the sampling
mechanism in use. Informally, sample efficiency is achievable with a large
sub-optimality gap when a generative model is available but is unfortunately
infeasible when we turn to standard online RL settings.
  In this paper, we make progress towards understanding this linear $Q^{\star}$
problem by investigating a new sampling protocol, which draws samples in an
online/exploratory fashion but allows one to backtrack and revisit previous
states in a controlled and infrequent manner. This protocol is more flexible
than the standard online RL setting, while being practically relevant and far
more restrictive than the generative model. We develop an algorithm tailored to
this setting, achieving a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the
feature dimension, the horizon, and the inverse sub-optimality gap, but not the
size of the state/action space. Our findings underscore the fundamental
interplay between sampling protocols and low-complexity structural
representation in RL.

observations leads to a mass bias, whose detailed understanding is critical in
deriving accurate mass-observable relations for constraining cosmological
models. Drawing from existing methods, we develop a robust framework for
calculating this mass bias in one-parameter fits to simulations of dark matter
halos. We show that our approach has the advantage of being independent of the
absolute noise level, so that only the number of halos in a given simulation
and the representativeness of the simulated halos for real clusters limit the
accuracy of the bias estimation. While we model the bias as a log-normal
distribution and the halos with a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, our method can
be generalized to any bias distribution and parametric model of the radial mass
distribution. We find that the log-normal assumption is not strictly valid in
the presence of miscentring of halos. We investigate the use of cluster centers
derived from weak lensing in the context of mass bias, and tentatively find
that such centroids can yield sensible mass estimates if the convergence peak
has a signal-to-noise ratio approximately greater than four. In this context we
also find that the standard approach to estimating the positional uncertainty
of weak lensing mass peaks using bootstrapping severely underestimates the true
positional uncertainty for peaks with low signal-to-noise ratios. Though we
determine the mass and redshift dependence of the bias distribution for a few
experimental setups, our focus remains providing a general approach to

tools for dynamical robotic systems. However, common methods to construct
Koopman representations seek to learn lifted linear models that cannot capture
nonlinear actuation effects inherent in many robotic systems. This paper
presents a learning and control methodology that is a first step towards
overcoming this limitation. Using the Koopman canonical transform,
control-affine dynamics can be expressed by a lifted bilinear model. The
learned model is used for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) design
where the bilinear structure can be exploited to improve computational
efficiency. The benefits for control-affine dynamics compared to existing
Koopman-based methods are highlighted through an example of a simulated planar
quadrotor. Prediction error is greatly reduced and closed loop performance
similar to NMPC with full model knowledge is achieved.

science goal for upcoming observational facilities. In most theoretical
channels proposed so far, the seed formation depends crucially on local gas
conditions. We systematically characterize the impact of a range of gas based
black hole seeding prescriptions on SMBH populations using cosmological
simulations. Seeds of mass $M_{\mathrm{seed}}\sim 10^3-10^{6}~M_{\odot}/h$ are
placed in halos that exceed critical thresholds for star-forming, metal-poor
gas mass and halo mass (defined as $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}$ and
$\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{h}}$, respectively, in units of $M_{\mathrm{seed}}$). We
quantify the impact of these parameters on the properties of $z\geq7$ SMBHs.
Lower seed masses produce much higher BH merger rates (by factors of $\sim10$
and $\sim1000$ at $z\sim7$ and $z\sim15$, respectively). For fixed seed mass,
we find that $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{h}}$ has the strongest impact on the BH
population at high redshift ($z\gtrsim15$, where a factor of 10 increase in
$\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{h}}$ suppresses merger rates by $\gtrsim 100$). At lower
redshift ($z\lesssim15$), we find that $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}$ has a
larger impact on the BH population. Increasing $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}$
from $5-150$ suppresses the merger rates by factors of $\sim8$ at $z\sim7-15$.
This suggests that the seeding criteria explored here could leave distinct
imprints on the redshift distribution of LISA merger rates. In contrast, AGN
luminosity functions are much less sensitive to seeding criteria, varying by
factors $\lesssim2-3$ within the seed parameters we have explored. Such
variations will be challenging to probe even with future sensitive instruments
such as Lynx or JWST. Overall, our systematic parameter study provides a useful
benchmark for development of seed models for large-volume cosmological
simulations.

information system. This paper analyses the reasons for which the Web became
the first successful hypermedia system by looking and evaluating the
architecture of the Web, Hyper-G, and Microcosm systems. Three reasons will be
given beyond this success with some lessons to learn. Currently, Semantic Web
is a recent development of the Web to provide conceptual hypermedia. More
importantly, study of the Web with its impact on technical, socio-cultural, and
economical agendas is introduced as web science.

galaxy is 1.4 Mpc in projection from its nearest massive neighbor. We do not
detect significant H$\alpha$ emission (EW(H$\alpha$)$ = -0.4 \pm 0.5$
angstroms), suggesting that COSMOS dw1 is likely quenched. Very little is
currently known about isolated quenched galaxies in this mass regime. Such
galaxies are thought to be rare, as there is no obvious mechanism to
permanently stop star formation in them; to date there are only four examples
of well-studied quenched field dwarfs, only two of which appear to have
quenched in isolation. COSMOS-dw1 is the first example outside of the immediate
vicinity of the Local Group. COSMOS-dw1 has a relatively weak
D$_\mathrm{n}$4000 break and the HST data show a clump of blue stars indicating
that star formation ceased only recently. We speculate that COSMOS-dw1 was
quenched due to internal feedback, which was able to temporarily suspend star
formation. In this scenario the expectation is that quenched isolated galaxies
with masses $M_*=10^6 - 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ generally have luminosity-weighted

X-ray emission and gas temperature, and often exhibit sharp boundaries with
typical shock Mach numbers of 2-4. The gas in the bubbles outflows with maximum
(95th pctl) radial velocities of 100-1500 km/s. TNG50 bubbles expand with
speeds as high as 1000-2000 km/s (about 1-2 kpc/Myr), but with a great
diversity and with larger bubbles expanding at slower speeds. The bubble gas is
at 10^6.4-7.2 K temperatures and is enriched to metallicities of 0.5-2 solar.
In TNG50, the bubbles are a manifestation of episodic, kinetic, wind-like
energy injections from the supermassive black holes at the galaxy centers that
accrete at low Eddington ratios. According to TNG50, X-ray, and possibly
gamma-ray, bubbles similar to those observed in the Milky Way should be a
frequent feature of disk-like galaxies prior to, or on the verge of, being
quenched. They should be within the grasp of eROSITA in the local Universe.

the bulk quantum state. In this paper, we derive a novel dual prescription for
the generalized entropy that allows us to interpret the leading quantum
corrections in a geometric way with minimal input from the bulk state. The
equivalence is proven using tools borrowed from convex optimization. The new
prescription does not involve bulk surfaces but instead uses a generalized
notion of a flow, which allows for possible sources or sinks in the bulk
geometry. In its discrete version, our prescription can alternatively be
interpreted in terms of a set of Planck-thickness bit threads, which can be
either classical or quantum. This interpretation uncovers an aspect of the
generalized entropy that admits a neat information-theoretic description,
namely, the fact that the quantum corrections can be cast in terms of
entanglement distillation of the bulk state. We also prove some general
properties of our prescription, including nesting and a quantum version of the
max multiflow theorem. These properties are used to verify that our proposal
respects known inequalities that a von Neumann entropy must satisfy, including
subadditivity and strong subadditivity, as well as to investigate the fate of
the holographic monogamy. Finally, using the Iyer-Wald formalism we show that
for cases with a local modular Hamiltonian there is always a canonical solution
to the program that exploits the property of bulk locality. Combining with
previous results by Swingle and Van Raamsdonk, we show that the consistency of
this special solution requires the semi-classical Einstein's equations to hold
for any consistent perturbative bulk quantum state.

with red and dead elliptical galaxies. Their optical spectrum suggests a
massive starburst that was quenched abruptly, and their bulge-dominated
morphologies with tidal tails suggest that they are merger remnants. AGN-driven
winds are believed to be one of the processes responsible for the sudden
quenching of star formation and for the expulsion and/or destruction of the
remaining molecular gas. Little is known about AGN-driven winds in this
short-lived phase. In this paper we present the first and unique sample of post
starburst galaxy candidates with AGN that show indications of ionized outflows
in their optical emission lines. Using IRAS-FIR observations, we study the star
formation in these systems and find that many systems selected to have post
starburst signatures in their optical spectrum are in fact obscured starbursts.
Using SDSS spectroscopy, we study the stationary and outflowing ionized gas. We
also detect neutral gas outflows in 40\% of the sources with mass outflow rates

of free fermions with long range hopping, which are exposed to continuous local

entanglement entropy growth, and by a slow algebraic decay of the
density-density correlation function, both with a fractional exponent. It
occurs for hopping decay exponents $1< p \lesssim 3/2$ independently of the
measurement rate. The algebraic phase gives rise to two critical lines,
separating it from a critical phase with logarithmic entanglement growth at
small, and an area law phase with constant entanglement entropy at large
monitoring rates. A perturbative renormalization group analysis suggests that
the transitions to the long-range phase are also unconventional, corresponding
to a modified sine-Gordon theory. Comparing exact numerical simulations of the
monitored wave functions with analytical predictions from a replica field

view of a measurement-induced phase transition as a quantum phase transition in
the dark state of an effective, non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

precise structure of gravitational radiation near infinity. We begin with a
brief review of an argument due to Christodoulou [1] stating that Penrose's
proposal of smooth conformal compactification of spacetime (or smooth null
infinity) fails to accurately capture the structure of gravitational radiation
emitted by $N$ infalling masses coming from past timelike infinity $i^-$.
Modelling gravitational radiation by scalar radiation, we then take a first
step towards a rigorous, fully general relativistic understanding of the
non-smoothness of null infinity by constructing solutions to the spherically
symmetric Einstein-Scalar field equations. Our constructions are motivated by
Christodoulou's argument: They arise dynamically from polynomially decaying
boundary data, $r\phi\sim t^{-1}$ as $t\to-\infty$, on a timelike hypersurface
(to be thought of as the surface of a star) and the no incoming radiation
condition, $r\partial_v\phi=0$, on past null infinity $\mathcal{I}^-$. We show
that if the initial Hawking mass at $i^-$ is non-zero, then, in accordance with
the non-smoothness of $\mathcal I^+$, $\partial_v(r\phi)$ satisfies the
following asymptotic expansion near $\mathcal{I}^+$ for some constant $C\neq
0$: $\partial_v(r\phi)=Cr^{-3}\log r+\mathcal O(r^{-3})$. We also show that the
same logarithmic terms appear in the linear theory, i.e. when considering the
spherically symmetric linear wave equation on a fixed Schwarzschild background.
  As a corollary, we can apply our results to the scattering problem on
Schwarzschild: Putting smooth, compactly supported scattering data for the wave
equation on $\mathcal I^-$ and on $\mathcal H^-$, we find that the asymptotic
expansion of $\partial_v(r\phi)$ near $\mathcal I^+$ generically contains
logarithmic terms at second order, i.e. at order $r^{-4}\log r$.

the reliability of different spectral synthesis methods in the estimation of
the mean stellar age and metallicity. The main question this work aims to
address is which signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) are needed to reliably determine
the mean stellar age and metallicity from a galaxy spectrum and how this
depends on the tool used to model the spectra. To address this question we
built a set of realistic simulated spectra containing stellar and nebular
emission, reproducing the evolution of a galaxy in two limiting cases: a
constant star formation rate and an exponentially declining star formation. We
degraded the synthetic spectra built from these two star formation histories
(SFHs) to different S/N and analysed them with three widely used spectral
synthesis codes, namely FADO, STECKMAP, and STARLIGHT. For S/N < 5 all three
tools show a large diversity in the results. The FADO and STARLIGHT tools find
median differences in the light-weighted mean stellar age of ~0.1 dex, while
STECKMAP shows a higher value of ~0.2 dex. Detailed investigations of the
best-fit spectrum for galaxies with overestimated mass-weighted quantities
point towards the inability of purely stellar models to fit the observed
spectra around the Balmer jump. Our results imply that when a galaxy enters a
phase of high specific star formation rate the neglect of the nebular continuum
emission in the fitting process has a strong impact on the estimation of its
SFH when purely stellar fitting codes are used, even in presence of high S/N
spectra.

the failure of ""peeling"" (and, thus, of smooth null infinity) in a
neighbourhood of $i^0$ derived therein translates into logarithmic corrections
at leading order to the well-known Price's law asymptotics near $i^+$. This
suggests that the non-smoothness of $\mathcal{I}^+$ is physically measurable.
More precisely, we consider the linear wave equation $\Box_g \phi=0$ on a fixed
Schwarzschild background ($M>0$), and we show the following: If one imposes
conformally smooth initial data on an ingoing null hypersurface (extending to
$\mathcal{H}^+$ and terminating at $\mathcal{I}^-$) and vanishing data on
$\mathcal{I}^-$ (this is the no incoming radiation condition), then the precise
leading-order asymptotics of the solution $\phi$ are given by
$r\phi|_{\mathcal{I}^+}=C u^{-2}\log u+\mathcal{O}(u^{-2})$ along future null
infinity, $\phi|_{r=R>2M}=2C\tau^{-3}\log\tau+\mathcal{O}(\tau^{-3})$ along
hypersurfaces of constant $r$, and $\phi|_{\mathcal{H}^+}=2Cv^{-3}\log
v+\mathcal{O}(v^{-3})$ along the event horizon. Moreover, the constant $C$ is
given by $C=4M I_0^{(\mathrm{past})}[\phi]$, where
$I_0^{(\mathrm{past})}[\phi]:=\lim_{u\to -\infty}
r^2\partial_u(r\phi_{\ell=0})$ is the past Newman--Penrose constant of $\phi$
on $\mathcal{I}^-$. Thus, the precise late-time asymptotics of $\phi$ are
completely determined by the early-time behaviour of the spherically symmetric
part of $\phi$ near $\mathcal{I}^-$. Similar results are obtained for
polynomially decaying timelike boundary data. The paper uses methods developed
by Angelopoulos--Aretakis--Gajic and is essentially self-contained.

we investigate the effects of such an EM-informed search on binary detection

datasets. We find that by applying EM priors, the Bayes factor of some injected
signals with originally marginal or sub-threshold detectability (i.e., Bayes
factor $\sim 1$) can increase by a factor of a few to an order of magnitude,
and thus an EM-informed targeted search is able to find hints of a signal when
an uninformed search fails to find any. Additionally, by combining EM and GW
data, one can achieve an overall improvement in parameter estimation,
regardless of the source's sky location or GW frequency. We discuss the

to the importance of CRs for the dynamical evolution of the interstellar, the
circumgalactic, and the intracluster medium. In these environments, CRs with
GeV energies can influence large-scale dynamics by regulating star formation,
driving galactic winds or by altering the pressure balance of galactic halos.
Recent efforts have moved the focus of the community from a one-moment
description of CR transport towards a two-moment model as this allows for a
more accurate description of the microphysics impacting the CR population. Like
all hydrodynamical theories, these two-moment methods require a closure
relation for a consistent and closed set of evolution equations. The goal of
this paper is to quantify the impact of different closure relations on the
resulting solutions. To this end, we review the common P1 and M1 closure
relations, derive a new four-moment H1 description for CR transport and
describe how to incorporate CR scattering by Alfv\'en waves into these three
hydrodynamical models. While there are significant differences in the transport
properties of radiation in the P1 and M1 approximations in comparison to more
accurate radiative transfer simulations using the discrete ordinates
approximation, we only find small differences between the three hydrodynamical
CR transport models in the free streaming limit when we neglect CR scattering.
Most importantly, for realistic applications in the interstellar,
circumgalactic or intracluster medium where CR scattering is frequent, these
differences vanish and all presented hydrodynamical models produce the same

multi-partite quantum state from the set of separable states as measured by the
quantum relative entropy. We show that this optimisation is always achieved,
i.e. any state admits a closest separable state, even in infinite dimensions;
also, $E_R$ is everywhere lower semi-continuous. We use this to derive a dual
variational expression for $E_R$ in terms of an external supremum instead of
infimum. These results, which seem to have gone unnoticed so far, hold not only
for the relative entropy of entanglement and its multi-partite generalisations,
but also for many other similar resource quantifiers, such as the relative
entropy of non-Gaussianity, of non-classicality, of Wigner negativity -- more
generally, all relative entropy distances from the sets of states with
non-negative $\lambda$-quasi-probability distribution. The crucial hypothesis
underpinning all these applications is the weak*-closedness of the cone
generated by free states, and for this reason the techniques we develop involve
a bouquet of classical results from functional analysis. We complement our
analysis by giving explicit and asymptotically tight continuity estimates for
$E_R$ and closely related quantities in the presence of an energy constraint.

  supernovae","13 pages, 12 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stab2964",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A subset of type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic), broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-bl), show
unusually high kinetic energies ($\sim 10^{52}$ erg) which cannot be explained
by the energy supplied by neutrinos alone. Many SNe Ic-bl have been observed in
coincidence with long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which suggests a connection
between SNe and GRBs. A small fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) form
a rapidly-rotating and strongly-magnetized protoneutron star (PNS), a
proto-magnetar. Jets from such magnetars can provide the high kinetic energies
observed in SNe Ic-bl and also provide the connection to GRBs. In this work we
use the jetted outflow produced in a 3D CCSN simulation from a consistently
formed proto-magnetar as the central engine for full-star explosion
simulations. We extract a range of central engine parameters and find that the
extracted engine energy is in the range of $6.231 \times 10^{51}-1.725 \times
10^{52}$ erg, the engine time-scale in the range of $0.479-1.159$ s and the
engine half-opening angle in the range of $\sim 9-19^{\circ}$. Using these as
central engines, we perform 2D special-relativistic (SR) hydrodynamic (HD) and
radiation transfer simulations to calculate the corresponding light curves and
spectra. We find that these central engine parameters successfully produce SNe
Ic-bl which demonstrates that jets from proto-magnetars can be viable engines
for SNe Ic-bl. We also find that only the central engines with smaller opening
angles ($\sim 10^{\circ}$) form a GRB implying that GRB formation is likely
associated with narrower jet outflows and Ic-bl's without GRBs may be
associated with wider outflows.

is called ""diluted bandit feedback"". Learning in this setting is even more
challenging than the bandit feedback setting, as there is more uncertainty in
the supervision. We propose an algorithm for multiclass classification using
dilute bandit feedback (MC-DBF), which uses the exploration-exploitation
strategy to predict the candidate set in each trial. We show that the proposed

of AdS implies two regions of the dual CFT share strong correlations. A private
curve is a causal curve which avoids the entanglement wedge of a specified
boundary region $\mathcal{U}$. The implied correlation is measured by the
conditional mutual information
$I(\mathcal{V}_1:\mathcal{V}_2\,|\,\mathcal{U})$, which is $O(1/G_N)$ when a
private causal curve exists. The regions $\mathcal{V}_1$ and $\mathcal{V}_2$
are specified by the endpoints of the causal curve and the placement of the
region $\mathcal{U}$. This gives a causal perspective on the conditional mutual
information in AdS/CFT, analogous to the causal perspective on the mutual
information given by earlier work on the connected wedge theorem. We give an
information theoretic argument for our theorem, along with a bulk geometric
proof. In the geometric perspective, the theorem follows from the maximin

the theorem follows from resource requirements for sending private messages

  Transformations",,,,,"cs.SE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays, we are witnessing an increasing demand in both corporates and
academia for exploiting Deep Learning (DL) to solve complex real-world
problems. A DL program encodes the network structure of a desirable DL model
and the process by which the model learns from the training dataset. Like any
software, a DL program can be faulty, which implies substantial challenges of
software quality assurance, especially in safety-critical domains. It is
therefore crucial to equip DL development teams with efficient fault detection
techniques and tools. In this paper, we propose NeuraLint, a model-based fault
detection approach for DL programs, using meta-modelling and graph
transformations. First, we design a meta-model for DL programs that includes
their base skeleton and fundamental properties. Then, we construct a
graph-based verification process that covers 23 rules defined on top of the
meta-model and implemented as graph transformations to detect faults and design
inefficiencies in the generated models (i.e., instances of the meta-model).
First, the proposed approach is evaluated by finding faults and design
inefficiencies in 28 synthesized examples built from common problems reported
in the literature. Then NeuraLint successfully finds 64 faults and design
inefficiencies in 34 real-world DL programs extracted from Stack Overflow posts
and GitHub repositories. The results show that NeuraLint effectively detects
faults and design issues in both synthesized and real-world examples with a
recall of 70.5 % and a precision of 100 %. Although the proposed meta-model is
designed for feedforward neural networks, it can be extended to support other
neural network architectures such as recurrent neural networks. Researchers can
also expand our set of verification rules to cover more types of issues in DL
programs.

specifically the difficulty in accessing data. The specifics of these very
constrained devices render the design of an IDS capable of dealing with the
varied attacks a very challenging problem and a very active research subject.
In the current state of literature, a number of approaches have been proposed
to improve the efficiency of intrusion detection, catering to some of these
limitations, such as resource constraints and mobility. In this article, we
review works on IDS specifically for these kinds of devices from 2008 to 2018,
collecting a total of 51 different IDS papers. We summarise the current themes

provide valuable insights and solutions for sub-parts of these constraints, we

of attacks these approaches struggle to detect and the setup limitations that
are unique to this kind of system. We find that although several paper claim
novelty of their approach little inter paper comparisons have been made, that
there is a dire need for sharing of datasets and almost no shared code

a wide range of applications to social and communication networks and used as a
building block in various other algorithms, such as the bi-connectivity and the
dynamic minimal spanning tree problems. In brief, we wish to maintain the
connected components of the graph under dynamic edge insertions and deletions.
In the sequential case, the problem has been well-studied from both theoretical
and practical perspectives. However, much less is known about efficient
concurrent solutions to this problem. This is the gap we address in this paper.
  We start from one of the classic data structures used to solve this problem,
the Euler Tour Tree. Our first contribution is a non-blocking single-writer
implementation of it. We leverage this data structure to obtain the first truly
concurrent generalization of dynamic connectivity, which preserves the time
complexity of its sequential counterpart, but is also scalable in practice. To
achieve this, we rely on three main techniques. The first is to ensure that
connectivity queries, which usually dominate real-world workloads, are
non-blocking. The second non-trivial technique expands the above idea by making
all queries that do not change the connectivity structure non-blocking. The
third ingredient is applying fine-grained locking for updating the connected
components, which allows operations on disjoint components to occur in
parallel.
  We evaluate the resulting algorithm on various workloads, executing on both
real and synthetic graphs. The results show the efficiency of each of the
proposed optimizations; the most efficient variant improves the performance of
a coarse-grained based implementation on realistic scenarios up to 6x on
average and up to 30x when connectivity queries dominate.

hosting an even number of flux quanta is capable of forming a
quasi-one-dimensional topological sub-system that can be mapped to the Kitaev
wire, if the vortex is trapped at a screw dislocation. This crystallographic
defect breaks inversion symmetry and thereby threads a local spin-orbit
coupling through the superconductor. The vortex-dislocation pair in the
otherwise trivial bulk can harbor a pair of Majorana bound states located at
the two surface terminations. We explain the topological transition in terms of
a band inversion in the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon vortex bound states and
discuss favorable material parameters.

former must deliver data qubits reliably within itself. Two types of QDNs are
studied, one using teleportation and the other using tell-and-go (TAG) to
exchange quantum data. Two corresponding quantum transport protocols (QTPs),
named Tele-QTP and TAG-QTP, are proposed to address many unique design
challenges involved in reliable delivery of data qubits, and constraints
imposed by quantum physics laws such as the no-cloning theorem, and limited
availability of quantum memory.
  The proposed Tele-QTP and TAG-QTP are the first transport layer protocols for
QDNs, complementing other works on the network protocol stack. Tele-QTP and
TAG-QTP have novel mechanisms to support congestion-free and reliable delivery
of streams of data qubits by managing the limited quantum memory at end hosts

customers, it is very hard for a single AI trader to make good deals with
various customers in a few turns, since customers may adopt different
strategies even the strategies they choose are quite simple. In this paper, we
model this problem as fast adaptive learning in the finitely repeated games. We
believe that past game history plays a vital role in such a learning procedure,
and therefore we propose a novel framework (named, F3) to fuse the past and
current game history with an Opponent Action Estimator (OAE) module that uses
past game history to estimate the opponent's future behaviors. The experiments
show that the agent trained by F3 can quickly defeat opponents who adopt
unknown new strategies. The F3 trained agent obtains more rewards in a fixed
number of turns than the agents that are trained by deep reinforcement
learning. Further studies show that the OAE module in F3 contains
meta-knowledge that can even be transferred across different games.

privacy requirement have been studied, but the definition of weak privacy needs
to be elaborated upon. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the weak privacy
(i.e., information leakage) in PIR problems by using the R\'enyi divergence
that generalizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. By introducing R\'enyi
divergence into the existing PIR problem, the tradeoff relationship between
privacy (information leakage) and PIR performance (download cost) is
characterized via convex optimization. Furthermore, we propose an alternative
PIR scheme with smaller message sizes than the Tian-Sun-Chen (TSC) scheme. The

deposit large volumes of material to shorten process duration. This reduces the

designing for Large-Scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM), difficulties can arise
in the manufacturing process, which may require the adaptation of the

Topology Optimization (TO) in order to generate optimized designs suitable to
the process resolution. This article proposes and compares two methods, which
are based on existing TO techniques that enable control of minimum and maximum
member size, and of minimum cavity size. The first method requires the minimum
and maximum member size to be equal to the deposition nozzle size, thus design
features of uniform width are obtained in the optimized design. The second
method defines the size of the solid members sufficiently small for the
resulting structure to resemble a structural skeleton, which can be interpreted
as the deposition path. Through filtering and projection techniques, the thin
structures are thickened according to the chosen nozzle size. Thus, a topology
tailored to the size of the deposition nozzle is obtained along with a

dispersive and dissipative compressible fluid flow solver in conjunction with
an acoustic perturbation equation solver based on the spectral/hp element
method. The hybrid approach involves calculating the base fields and the
acoustic sources from a fluid simulation in the first step. In the next step,
the acoustic solver utilizes the variables to predict the acoustic propagation
due to the given sources. The validation of the methodology against benchmark
cases provides quite accurate results while compared against the existing
literature. The study is then extended to assess the importance of the entropy
source term for the flow over a rectangular cavity. The predictions of hybrid
simulations with vortex and entropy source terms reproduce the perturbation
pressure values very close to the existing direct numerical simulation results.
Moreover, the results suggest that the use of just the vortex source terms
over-predicts the perturbation pressure near the source region. Finally, we
have carried out detailed simulations with all the source terms to investigate
the noise sources for compressible flow over the cavity for different Mach
number ranges (M = 0.4; 0.5; 0.6; 0.7; 1.5). The obtained acoustic spectra and

solar photovoltaic (PV) levelized cost of energy (LCOE), the number of
behind-the-meter solar PV systems is expected to increase steadily. The ability
to estimate solar generation from these latent systems is crucial for a range
of applications, including distribution system planning and operation, demand
response, and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). This paper investigates the
problem of disaggregating solar generation from smart meter data when
historical disaggregated data from the target home is unavailable, and
deployment characteristics of the PV system are unknown. The proposed approach
entails inferring the physical characteristics from smart meter data and
disaggregating solar generation using an iterative algorithm. This algorithm
takes advantage of solar generation data (aka proxy measurements) from a few
sites that are located in the same area as the target home, and solar
generation data synthesized using a physical PV model. We evaluate our methods
with 4 different proxy settings on around 160 homes in the United States and
Australia, and show that the solar disaggregation accuracy is improved by
32.31% and 15.66% over two state-of-the-art methods using only one real proxy
along with three synthetic proxies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using the
disaggregated home load rather than the net load data could improve the overall
accuracy of three popular NILM methods by at least 22%.

  MetaSys implements a rich hardware-software interface and lightweight
metadata support that can be used as a common basis to rapidly implement and
evaluate new cross-layer techniques. We demonstrate MetaSys's versatility and
ease-of-use by implementing and evaluating three cross-layer techniques for:
(i) prefetching for graph analytics; (ii) bounds checking in memory unsafe
languages, and (iii) return address protection in stack frames; each technique
only requiring ~100 lines of Chisel code over MetaSys.

We design MetaSys to minimize these inefficiencies and provide increased

three-species stochastic May-Leonard model with asymmetric predation rates on a
spatially inhomogeneous two-dimensional toroidal lattice using Monte Carlo
simulations. In an isolated setting, strongly asymmetric predation rates lead
to rapid extinction from coexistence of all three species to a single surviving
population. Even for weakly asymmetric predation rates, only a fraction of
ecologies in a statistical ensemble manages to maintain full three-species
coexistence. However, when the asymmetric competing system is coupled via
diffusive proliferation to a fully symmetric May-Leonard patch, the stable
spiral patterns from this region induce transient plane-wave fronts and
ultimately quasi-stationary spiral patterns in the vulnerable asymmetric
region. Thus the endangered ecological subsystem may effectively become
stabilized through immigration from even a much smaller stable region. To
describe the stabilization of spiral population structures in the asymmetric
region, we compare the increase in the robustness of these topological defects
at extreme values of the asymmetric predation rates in the spatially coupled
system with the corresponding asymmetric May-Leonard model in isolation. We
delineate the quasi-stationary nature of coexistence induced in the asymmetric

framework for unsupervised domain adaptation based on the notion of
target-domain consistency training. Intuitively, our work is based on the idea
that in order to perform well on the target domain, a model's output should be
consistent with respect to small perturbations of inputs in the target domain.
Specifically, we introduce a new loss term to enforce pixelwise consistency
between the model's predictions on a target image and a perturbed version of
the same image. In comparison to popular adversarial adaptation methods, our
approach is simpler, easier to implement, and more memory-efficient during
training. Experiments and extensive ablation studies demonstrate that our
simple approach achieves remarkably strong results on two challenging
synthetic-to-real benchmarks, GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes.

the recent 3D ConvNets are too rigid to capture the subtle visual patterns
across an action, this research direction is dominated by methods combining RGB

absence of appropriate sensors. This limits the usage of aforementioned
approaches in real-world applications requiring low latency. Then, how to best
take advantage of 3D Poses for recognizing ADL? To this end, we propose an
extension of a pose driven attention mechanism: Video-Pose Network (VPN),
exploring two distinct directions. One is to transfer the Pose knowledge into
RGB through a feature-level distillation and the other towards mimicking pose
driven attention through an attention-level distillation. Finally, these two

be represented in terms of functions belonging to this class P. It was also
argued that the set of common solutions of both sets of equations is wider, it
was proved that these solutions could be formulated in terms of generalized
functions. The existence of such generalized functions motions is explicitly
demonstrated for the relevant example of the instantaneously applied constant

Thus, both, the velocity and the position are discontinuous at the instant that

the human level of recognition based only on a small number of training images.
One main solution to few-shot image classification is deep metric learning.
These methods, by classifying unseen samples according to their distances to
few seen samples in an embedding space learned by powerful deep neural
networks, can avoid overfitting to few training images in few-shot image
classification and have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. In this
paper, we provide an up-to-date review of deep metric learning methods for
few-shot image classification from 2018 to 2022 and categorize them into three
groups according to three stages of metric learning, namely learning feature
embeddings, learning class representations, and learning distance measures.
With this taxonomy, we identify the novelties of different methods and problems
they face. We conclude this review with a discussion on current challenges and
future trends in few-shot image classification.

and, in turn, are regulated by Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In order to
ensure SLAs are being met, service levels need to be monitored. One technique
for this involves active measurement mechanisms which employ measurement probes
along the network to inject synthetic traffic and compute the network
performance. However, these mechanisms are expensive in terms of resources
consumption. Thus, these mechanisms usually can cover only a fraction of what
could be measured, which can lead to SLA violations being missed. Besides that,
the definition of this fraction is a practice done by human administrators,
which does not scale well and does not adapt to highly dynamic networking
patterns. In this article, we examine the potential benefits of using P2P
technology to improve the detection of SLA Violations. We first describe the
principles of a P2P-based steering of active measurement mechanisms. These
principles are characterized by a high degree of decentralized decision making
across a network using a self-organizing overlay. In a second step, we present
measurement session activation strategies based on these principles. These
strategies do not require human intervention, are adaptive to changes in
network conditions, and independent of the underlying active measurement

nanometer-sized structures. In addition, by mixing static and optical fields,
the strong nonlinear response of monolayer hBN gives rise to substantial
frequency shifts of optical phonon modes, exceeding their spectral width for
in-plane DC fields that are attainable using lateral gating technology. We
therefore predict a practical scheme for electrical tunability of the
vibrational modes with potential interest in mid-infrared optoelectronics. The
strong nonlinear response, low damping, and robustness of hBN polaritons set

bounded in absolute value by two. Determinants are also used to bound the
$\ell_1$-distance between IP solutions and solutions of its linear relaxation.
One of the first works to quantify the complexity of IPs with bounded

general determinants has been super-polynomial in the determinants or the
number of equations. We provide the first column bound that is polynomial in

to the empirical probability distribution sampled from the output of a quantum

associated with measurement of each computational basis state. However, the
resources required to characterize a complete response matrix and to compute
the corrected probability distribution scale exponentially in the number of
qubits $n$. In this work, we modify standard matrix inversion techniques using
two perturbative approximations with significantly reduced complexity and
bounded error when the likelihood of high order bitflip events is strongly
suppressed. Given a characteristic error rate $q$, our first method recovers
the probability of the all-zeros bitstring $p_0$ by sampling only a small
subspace of the response matrix before inverting readout error resulting in a
relative speedup of $\text{poly}\left(2^{n} / \big(\begin{smallmatrix} n \\ w

model for which the approximation incurs only $O(q^w)$ error for some integer
$w$. We then provide a generalized technique to efficiently recover full output
distributions with $O(q^w)$ error in the perturbative limit. These approximate
techniques for readout error correction may greatly accelerate near term

on the perception and prediction of other agents' behaviors to plan safe
trajectories. However, as occlusions limit the vehicle's perception ability,
reasoning about potential hazards beyond the field of view is one of the most
challenging issues in developing autonomous driving systems. This paper
introduces a novel analytical approach that poses safe trajectory planning
under occlusions as a hybrid zero-sum dynamic game between the autonomous
vehicle (evader) and an initially hidden traffic participant (pursuer). Due to
occlusions, the pursuer's state is initially unknown to the evader and may
later be discovered by the vehicle's sensors. The analysis yields optimal
strategies for both players as well as the set of initial conditions from which
the autonomous vehicle is guaranteed to avoid collisions. We leverage this
theoretical result to develop a novel trajectory planning framework for
autonomous driving that provides worst-case safety guarantees while minimizing
conservativeness by accounting for the vehicle's ability to actively avoid
other road users as soon as they are detected in future observations. Our
framework is agnostic to the driving environment and suitable for various
motion planners. We demonstrate our algorithm on challenging urban and highway
driving scenarios using the open-source CARLA simulator.

the one hand is the community of researchers that bases feedback control design
on pendulum models selected to capture the center of mass dynamics of the robot
during walking. On the other hand is the community that bases feedback control
design on virtual constraints, which induce an exact low-dimensional model in
the closed-loop system. In the first case, the low-dimensional model is valued
for its physical insight and analytical tractability. In the second case, the
low-dimensional model is integral to a rigorous analysis of the stability of
walking gaits in the full-dimensional model of the robot. This paper seeks to
clarify the commonalities and differences in the two perspectives for using
low-dimensional models. In the process of doing so, we argue that angular
momentum about the contact point is a better indicator of robot state than
linear velocity. Concretely, we show that an approximate (pendulum and zero
dynamics) model parameterized by angular momentum provides better predictions
for foot placement on a physical robot (e.g., legs with mass) than does a
related approximate model parameterized in terms of linear velocity. We
implement an associated angular-momentum-based controller on Cassie, a 3D

was pre-trained with public Calgary brain images and then fine-tuned for use in
(1) patients with tumors in our center; (2) different anatomies, including knee

remove the artifacts found in PI-GAN and yield smoother brain edges. The
transfer learning results for the knee and liver were superior to those of the

analysis. While significant progress has been made to achieve accurate
representations for downstream applications, the learned representations often
lack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from
previous efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the
semantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized
representation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled
representation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of
learning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored
due to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex
temporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret,
2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable
semantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of
individuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a
novel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically,
to generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and
disentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level
disentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group
semantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL
vanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while
preserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL
to keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various
real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by
DTS achieve superior performance in downstream applications, with high
interpretability of semantic concepts.

properties measurable at coarser scales, and has the potential to provide high
resolution information at a lower computational and storage cost than numerical
simulation alone. This is especially appealing for targeting convective scales,
which are at the edge of what is possible to simulate operationally. Since
convective scale weather has a high degree of independence from larger scales,
a generative approach is essential. We here propose a statistical method for
downscaling moist variables to convective scales using conditional Gaussian
random fields, with an application to wet bulb potential temperature (WBPT)
data over the UK. Our model uses an adaptive covariance estimation to capture
the variable spatial properties at convective scales. We further propose a
method for the validation, which has historically been a challenge for
generative models.

structures known to host magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and oscillations. Of
particular interest are the observed properties of transverse loop
oscillations, such as their frequency and mode of oscillation, which have
received significant attention in recent years because of their seismological
capability. Previous studies have relied on standard data analysis techniques,
such as a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet transform (WT), to correctly
extract periodicities and identify the MHD modes. However, how these methods
can lead to artefacts requires investigation. We assess whether these two
common spectral analysis techniques in coronal seismology can successfully
identify high-frequency waves from an oscillating coronal loop. We examine
extreme ultraviolet images of a coronal loop observed by the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly in the 171 \AA waveband on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory. We perform a spectral analysis of the loop waveform and compare
our observation with a basic simulation. The spectral FFT and WT power of the
observed loop waveform is found to reveal a significant signal with frequency
2.67 mHz superposed onto the dominant mode of oscillation of the loop (1.33
mHz), that is, the second harmonic of the loop. The simulated data show that
the second harmonic is completely artificial even though both of these methods
identify this mode as a real signal. This artificial harmonic, and several
higher modes, are shown to arise owing to the periodic but non-uniform
brightness of the loop. We further illustrate that the reconstruction of the
2.67 mHz component in the presence of noise yields a false perception of
oscillatory behaviour that does not otherwise exist. We suggest that additional
techniques such as a forward model of a 3D coronal arcade are necessary to
verify such high-frequency waves.

adaptive video encoding approach that leverages the generated forward
prediction models that qualify for real-time adaptation using different codecs

Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) is a sample-efficient approach for

existing methods perform poorly when the observations are corrupted by noise.
We propose a novel acquisition function, NEHVI, that overcomes this important
practical limitation by applying a Bayesian treatment to the popular expected
hypervolume improvement (EHVI) criterion and integrating over this uncertainty
in the Pareto frontier. We argue that, even in the noiseless setting,
generating multiple candidates in parallel is an incarnation of EHVI with
uncertainty in the Pareto frontier and therefore can be addressed using the
same underlying technique. Through this lens, we derive a natural parallel
variant, $q$NEHVI, that reduces computational complexity of parallel EHVI from
exponential to polynomial with respect to the batch size. $q$NEHVI is one-step
Bayes-optimal for hypervolume maximization in both noisy and noiseless
environments, and we show that it can be optimized effectively with
gradient-based methods via sample average approximation. Empirically, we
demonstrate not only that $q$NEHVI is substantially more robust to observation
noise than existing MOBO approaches, but also that it achieves state-of-the-art
optimization performance and competitive wall-times in large-batch

to which developers working on the same file or on two related files, need to
communicate. As socio-technical congruence is a complex and multi-faceted
phenomenon, the interpretability of the results is one of our main concerns, so
we have employed a careful mixed-methods statistical analysis. In particular,
we provide analyses with similar techniques as employed by seminal work in the
field to ensure comparability of our results with the existing body of work.
The major result of our study, based on an analysis of 25 large open-source
projects, is that STMC is not related to project quality measures -- software
bugs and churn -- in any temporal scenario. That is, we find no statistical
relationship between the alignment of developer tasks and developer
communications on the one hand, and project outcomes on the other hand. We
conclude that, wherefore congruence does matter as literature shows, then its

based on finite groups, and is later generalized to semi-simple Hopf algebras.
We rigorously define and study ribbon operators in the generalized Kitaev
quantum double model. These ribbon operators are important tools to understand
quasi-particle excitations. It turns out that there are some subtleties in
defining the operators in contrast to what one would naively think. In
particular, one has to distinguish two classes of ribbons which we call locally
clockwise and locally counterclockwise ribbons. Moreover, this issue already
exists in the original model based on finite non-Abelian groups. We show how
certain properties would fail even in the original model if we do not
distinguish these two classes of ribbons. Perhaps not surprisingly, under the
new definitions ribbon operators satisfy all properties that are expected. For
instance, they create quasi-particle excitations only at the end of the ribbon,
and the types of the quasi-particles correspond to irreducible representations
of the Drinfeld double of the input Hopf algebra. However, the proofs of these
properties are much more complicated than those in the case of finite groups.
This is partly due to the complications in dealing with general Hopf algebras
rather than just group algebras.

the identification of a suitable linearized system that preserves the
underlying commutator structure for the original equation. We observe that this
structure is ultimately crucial for obtaining continuity of the flow map. In
particular, straightforward applications of previous methods for active
transport equations fail to capture the more nuanced commutator structure of
the equation in this more singular regime. The proposed linearized system
nontrivially modifies the flux of the original system in such a way that it
coincides with the original flux when evaluated along solutions of the original

edits (e.g. sentiment transfer from I had a terrible time... to I had a great
time...). We propose a coarse-to-fine editor for style transfer that transforms
text using Levenshtein edit operations (e.g. insert, replace, delete). Unlike
prior single-span edit methods, our method concurrently edits multiple spans in
the source text. To train without parallel style text pairs (e.g. pairs of +/-
sentiment statements), we propose an unsupervised data synthesis procedure. We
first convert text to style-agnostic templates using style classifier attention
(e.g. I had a SLOT time...), then fill in slots in these templates using
fine-tuned pretrained language models. Our method outperforms existing
generation and editing style transfer methods on sentiment (Yelp, Amazon) and
politeness (Polite) transfer. In particular, multi-span editing achieves higher
performance and more diverse output than single-span editing. Moreover,
compared to previous methods on unsupervised data synthesis, our method results
in higher quality parallel style pairs and improves model performance.

by Saad, Shenker, Stanford, and Yao. Working in a collective field description,
they derived a remarkable identity: the square of the partition function with
fixed couplings is well approximated by a ""wormhole"" saddle plus a ""pair of
linked half-wormholes"" saddle. It explains factorization of decoupled systems.
Here, we derive an explicit formula for the half-wormhole contribution. It is
expressed through a hyperpfaffian of the tensor of SYK couplings. We then
develop a perturbative expansion around the half-wormhole saddle. This
expansion truncates at a finite order and gives the exact answer. The last term
in the perturbative expansion turns out to coincide with the wormhole
contribution. In this sense the wormhole saddle in this model does not need to
be added separately, but instead can be viewed as a large fluctuation around
the linked half-wormholes.

mitigate the effect of wrong-labeling through selective attention mechanism and
handle long-tail relations by introducing relation hierarchies to share
knowledge. However, almost all existing studies ignore the fact that, in a
sentence, the appearance order of two entities contributes to the understanding
of its semantics. Furthermore, they only utilize each relation level of
relation hierarchies separately, but do not exploit the heuristic effect
between relation levels, i.e., higher-level relations can give useful
information to the lower ones. Based on the above, in this paper, we design a
novel Recursive Hierarchy-Interactive Attention network (RHIA) to further
handle long-tail relations, which models the heuristic effect between relation
levels. From the top down, it passes relation-related information layer by
layer, which is the most significant difference from existing models, and
generates relation-augmented sentence representations for each relation level

problems as topological sorting and acyclicity testing. We also study the
related problems of finding a minimum feedback arc set (edges whose removal
yields an acyclic graph), and finding a sink vertex. We are interested in both
adversarially-ordered and randomly-ordered streams. For arbitrary input graphs
with edges ordered adversarially, we show that most of these problems have high
space complexity, precluding sublinear-space solutions. Some lower bounds also
apply when the stream is randomly ordered: e.g., in our most technical result
we show that testing acyclicity in the $p$-pass random-order model requires
roughly $n^{1+1/p}$ space. For other problems, random ordering can make a
dramatic difference: e.g., it is possible to find a sink in an acyclic
tournament in the one-pass random-order model using polylog$(n)$ space whereas
under adversarial ordering roughly $n^{1/p}$ space is necessary and sufficient
given $\Theta(p)$ passes. We also design sublinear algorithms for the feedback
arc set problem in tournament graphs; for random graphs; and for randomly
ordered streams. In some cases, we give lower bounds establishing that our
algorithms are essentially space-optimal. Together, our results complement the

\cite{newhwenozq} and the fixed-point iteration with Gauss-Seidel fast sweeping
strategy, to solve the static Hamilton-Jacobi equations in a novel HWENO
framework recently developed in \cite{mehweno1}. The proposed HWENO frameworks
enjoys several advantages. First, compared with the traditional HWENO
framework, the proposed methods do not need to introduce additional auxiliary
equations to update the derivatives of the unknown function $\phi$. They are
now computed from the current value of $\phi$ and the previous spatial
derivatives of $\phi$. This approach saves the computational storage and CPU
time, which greatly improves the computational efficiency of the traditional
HWENO scheme. In addition, compared with the traditional WENO method,
reconstruction stencil of the HWENO methods becomes more compact, their
boundary treatment is simpler, and the numerical errors are smaller on the same
mesh. Second, the fixed-point fast sweeping method is used to update the
numerical approximation. It is an explicit method and does not involve the
inverse operation of nonlinear Hamiltonian, therefore any Hamilton-Jacobi
equations with complex Hamiltonian can be solved easily. It also resolves some
known issues, including that the iterative number is very sensitive to the
parameter $\varepsilon$ used in the nonlinear weights, as observed in previous
studies. Finally, in order to further reduce the computational cost, a hybrid
strategy is also presented. Extensive numerical experiments are performed on
two-dimensional problems, which demonstrate the good performance of the
proposed fixed-point fast sweeping HWENO methods.

In this article, we propose a new efficient sparse estimate in HSIC based

can handle the large p small n scenario naturally. Through extensive simulation

simultaneously and compete with each other, have been widely observed in the
real world, yet the way arbitrary-sized interactions affect competing spreading
dynamics still lacks systematic study. This study presents a model of two
competing simplicial susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemics on a
higher-order system represented by simplicial complex and analyzes the model's
critical phenomena. In the proposed model, a susceptible node can only be
infected by one of the two epidemics, and the transmission of infection to
neighbors can occur through pairwise (i.e., an edge) and high-order (e.g.,
2-simplex) interactions simultaneously. Through a mean-field (MF) theory
analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the model displays rich
dynamical behavior depending on the 2-simplex infection strength. When the
2-simplex infection strength is weak, the model's phase diagram is consistent
with the simple graph, consisting of three regions: the absolute dominant
regions for each epidemic and the epidemic-free region. With the increase of
the 2-simplex infection strength, a new phase region called the alternative
dominant region emerges. In this region, the survival of one epidemic depends
on the initial conditions. Our theoretical analysis can reasonably predict the
time evolution and steady-state outbreak size in each region. In addition, we
further explore the model's phase diagram both when the 2-simplex infection
strength is symmetrical and asymmetrical. The results show that the 2-simplex
infection strength has a significant impact on the system phase diagram.

and ranking. The matching stage (also known as the retrieval step) identifies a
small fraction of relevant items from billion-scale item corpus in low latency

embedding-based retrieval (EBR) have been long used in the industrial matching
stage owing to its efficiency. However, item-based CF is hard to meet
personalization, while EBR has difficulty in satisfying diversity. In this
paper, we propose a novel matching architecture, Path-based Deep Network (named
PDN), which can incorporate both personalization and diversity to enhance
matching performance. Specifically, PDN is comprised of two modules: Trigger
Net and Similarity Net. PDN utilizes Trigger Net to capture the user's interest
in each of his/her interacted item, and Similarity Net to evaluate the
similarity between each interacted item and the target item based on these
items' profile and CF information. The final relevance between the user and the
target item is calculated by explicitly considering user's diverse interests,
\ie aggregating the relevance weights of the related two-hop paths (one hop of
a path corresponds to user-item interaction and the other to item-item
relevance). Furthermore, we describe the architecture design of a matching
system with the proposed PDN in a leading real-world E-Commerce service (Mobile
Taobao App). Based on offline evaluations and online A/B test, we show that PDN
outperforms the existing solutions for the same task. The online results also
demonstrate that PDN can retrieve more personalized and more diverse relevant
items to significantly improve user engagement. Currently, PDN system has been
successfully deployed at Mobile Taobao App and handling major online traffic.

in nature but highly desired in numerous areas, such as solar-thermal energy
harvesting, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and
anti-counterfeiting. Due to the lack of spectral selectivity in intrinsic
materials, such counter-intuitive properties are generally realized by
constructing complicated subwavelength metamaterials with costly
nanofabrication techniques. Here we report the low mid-IR emissivity (down to
10%) of 2D Ti3C2Tx MXenes. Associated with a high solar absorptance (up to
90%), they embrace the best spectral selectivity among the reported intrinsic
black solar absorbing materials. Their appealing potentials in several
aforementioned areas are experimentally demonstrated. First-principles
calculations reveal that the IR emissivity of MXenes relies on both the
nanoflake orientations and terminal groups, indicating great tunability. The
calculations also suggest that more MXenes including Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx
are also potential low-emissivity materials. This work opens the avenue to
further exploration of a family of intrinsically low-emissivity materials with

learning in point clouds has attracted increasing attention. In the
self-supervised manner, establishing correspondences between two point clouds
to approximate scene flow is an effective approach. Previous methods often
obtain correspondences by applying point-wise matching that only takes the
distance on 3D point coordinates into account, introducing two critical issues:
(1) it overlooks other discriminative measures, such as color and surface
normal, which often bring fruitful clues for accurate matching; and (2) it
often generates sub-par performance, as the matching is operated in an
unconstrained situation, where multiple points can be ended up with the same
corresponding point. To address the issues, we formulate this matching task as
an optimal transport problem. The output optimal assignment matrix can be
utilized to guide the generation of pseudo ground truth. In this optimal
transport, we design the transport cost by considering multiple descriptors and
encourage one-to-one matching by mass equality constraints. Also, constructing
a graph on the points, a random walk module is introduced to encourage the
local consistency of the pseudo labels. Comprehensive experiments on
FlyingThings3D and KITTI show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among self-supervised learning methods. Our self-supervised method
even performs on par with some supervised learning approaches, although we do
not need any ground truth flow for training.

Tremendous methods have been proposed for chatbots to generate responses with

positive emotion of the user, in human-machine conversation. We propose a
weakly supervised Emotion Eliciting Machine (EEM) to address this problem.
Specifically, we first collect weak labels of user emotion status changes in a
conversion based on a pre-trained emotion classifier. Then we propose a dual
encoder-decoder structure to model the generation of responses in both positive
and negative side based on the changes of the user's emotion status in the

structure to balance the positive and negative emotional impacts on the

fine-grained controlling manner for emotion elicitation. Experimental results

primum and septum secundum located in the anterosuperior portion of the atrial
septum. PFO is one of the main factors causing cryptogenic stroke which is the
fifth leading cause of death in the United States. For PFO diagnosis, contrast
transthoracic echocardiography (cTTE) is preferred as being a more robust
method compared with others. However, the current PFO diagnosis through cTTE is
extremely slow as it is proceeded manually by sonographers on echocardiography
videos. Currently there is no publicly available dataset for this important
topic in the community. In this paper, we present EchoCP, as the first
echocardiography dataset in cTTE targeting PFO diagnosis.
  EchoCP consists of 30 patients with both rest and Valsalva maneuver videos
which covers various PFO grades. We further establish an automated baseline
method for PFO diagnosis based on the state-of-the-art cardiac chamber
segmentation technique, which achieves 0.89 average mean Dice score, but only
0.60/0.67 mean accuracies for PFO diagnosis, leaving large room for
improvement. We hope that the challenging EchoCP dataset can stimulate further
research and lead to innovative and generic solutions that would have an impact
in multiple domains. Our dataset is released.

  Reinforcement Learning: A Principled Approach",,,,,"cs.LG cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) becomes more challenging in the
presence of more agents, as the capacity of the joint state and action spaces
grows exponentially in the number of agents. To address such a challenge of
scale, we identify a class of cooperative MARL problems with permutation
invariance, and formulate it as a mean-field Markov decision processes (MDP).
To exploit the permutation invariance therein, we propose the mean-field
proximal policy optimization (MF-PPO) algorithm, at the core of which is a
permutation-invariant actor-critic neural architecture. We prove that MF-PPO
attains the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate of convergence.
Moreover, its sample complexity is independent of the number of agents. We
validate the theoretical advantages of MF-PPO with numerical experiments in the
multi-agent particle environment (MPE). In particular, we show that the
inductive bias introduced by the permutation-invariant neural architecture
enables MF-PPO to outperform existing competitors with a smaller number of
model parameters, which is the key to its generalization performance.

robustness of deep convolution neural networks (CNNs). Just like common network
training, the effectiveness of AT relies on the design of basic network
components. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study on the role of the
basic ReLU activation component in AT for robust CNNs. We find that the
spatially-shared and input-independent properties of ReLU activation make CNNs
less robust to white-box adversarial attacks with either standard or
adversarial training. To address this problem, we extend ReLU to a novel Sparta
activation function (Spatially attentive and Adversarially Robust Activation),
which enables CNNs to achieve both higher robustness, i.e., lower error rate on
adversarial examples, and higher accuracy, i.e., lower error rate on clean
examples, than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) activation functions. We
further study the relationship between Sparta and the SOTA activation
functions, providing more insights about the advantages of our method. With
comprehensive experiments, we also find that the proposed method exhibits
superior cross-CNN and cross-dataset transferability. For the former, the
adversarially trained Sparta function for one CNN (e.g., ResNet-18) can be
fixed and directly used to train another adversarially robust CNN (e.g.,
ResNet-34). For the latter, the Sparta function trained on one dataset (e.g.,
CIFAR-10) can be employed to train adversarially robust CNNs on another dataset
(e.g., SVHN). In both cases, Sparta leads to CNNs with higher robustness than
the vanilla ReLU, verifying the flexibility and versatility of the proposed
method.

cities. With the help of deep learning and reinforcement learning, people have
proposed various policies to solve these traffic-related problems, such as
smart traffic signal control systems and taxi dispatching systems. People
usually validate these policies in a city simulator, since directly applying
them in the real city introduces real cost. However, these policies validated
in the city simulator may fail in the real city if the simulator is
significantly different from the real world. To tackle this problem, we need to
build a real-like traffic simulation system. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose to learn the human routing model, which is one of the most essential
part in the traffic simulator. This problem has two major challenges. First,
human routing decisions are determined by multiple factors, besides the common
time and distance factor. Second, current historical routes data usually covers
just a small portion of vehicles, due to privacy and device availability
issues. To address these problems, we propose a theory-guided residual network
model, where the theoretical part can emphasize the general principles for
human routing decisions (e.g., fastest route), and the residual part can
capture drivable condition preferences (e.g., local road or highway). Since the
theoretical part is composed of traditional shortest path algorithms that do
not need data to train, our residual network can learn human routing models
from limited data. We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets to show the superior performance of our model, especially
with small data. Besides, we have also illustrated why our model is better at
recovering real routes through case studies.

with either oxytocin or placebo, we demonstrate that oxytocin changes the
topology of brain communities in DMN and FPN, leading to higher synchronization
in the FPN and lower synchronization in the DMN, as well as a higher variance
of the coupling strength within the DMN and more flexible coupling patterns
across time. These results together indicate that oxytocin may increase the
ability to overcome the corresponding internal oscillation dispersion and
support the flexibility in neural synchrony in various social contexts,
providing new evidence for explaining the oxytocin modulated social behaviors.
Our proposed Kuramoto model-based framework can be a potential tool in network
neuroscience and offers physical and neural insights into phase dynamics of the
brain.

some typical moving contact line problems on chemically inhomogeneous surfaces

to approximate the model for asymptotically small chemical patterns. We obtain
a quantitative formula for the averaged dynamic contact angles. It gives
explicitly how the advancing and receding contact angles depend on the velocity
and the chemical inhomogeneity of the substrate. The formula is a
coarse-graining version of the Cox-type boundary condition on inhomogeneous

(almost) the same revenue as the optimal auction.
  Recently, Feldman, Friedler, and Rubinstein [EC, 2018] showed that an

theoretical and practical implications in mechanics and other fields of
heterogeneous media. Eshelby's finding that a uniform eigenstrain prescribed in
a solitary ellipsoidal inclusion in an infinite isotropic medium results in a
uniform elastic strain field in the inclusion leads to the conjecture that the
ellipsoid is the only inclusion that possesses the so-called Eshelby uniformity
property. Previously, only the weak version of the conjecture has been proved
for the isotropic medium, whereas the general validity of the conjecture for
anisotropic media in three dimensions is yet to be explored. In this work,
firstly, we present proofs of the weak version of the generalized Eshelby
conjecture for anisotropic media that possess cubic, transversely isotropic,
orthotropic, and monoclinic symmetries. Secondly, we prove that in these
anisotropic media, there exist non-ellipsoidal inclusions that can transform
particular polynomial eigenstrains of even degrees into polynomial elastic
strain fields of the same even degrees in them. These results constitute
counter-examples, in the strong sense, to the generalized high-order Eshelby
conjecture (inverse problem of Eshelby's polynomial conservation theorem) for
polynomial eigenstrains in both anisotropic media and the isotropic medium
(quadratic eigenstrain only). These findings reveal striking richness of the
uniformity between the eigenstrains and the correspondingly induced elastic
strains in inclusions in anisotropic media beyond the canonical ellipsoidal
inclusions. Since the strain fields in embedded and inherently anisotropic
quantum dot crystals are effective tuning knobs of the quality of the emitted
photons by the quantum dots, the results may have implications in the
technology of quantum information, in addition to in mechanics and materials
science.

Inducing magnetic order in topological insulators via proximity to a magnetic

involves a sandwich structure comprising two single layers of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D
ferromagnetic insulator) with ultra-thin Bi2Te3 in the middle, and is predicted
to yield a robust QAH insulator phase with a bandgap well above thermal energy

However, existing results either guarantee highly suboptimal estimation errors,

and zirconium fabricated by laser powder bed fusion. Crack-free and creep
resistant components are achieved for alloys with boron, carbon and no
zirconium. We then rationalize this result by evaluating how boron, carbon and
zirconium are distributed at grain boundaries in the as-built and heat-treated
microstructures of an alloy containing all these elements. Observations are
conducted by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe
tomography. In the as-built microstructure, boron, carbon and zirconium
segregate at high-angle grain boundaries as a result of solute partitioning to
the liquid and limited solid-state diffusion during solidification and cooling.
After heat-treatment, the amount of boron and carbon segregating at grain
boundaries increases significantly. In contrast, zirconium is not found at
grain boundaries but it partitions at the gamma' precipitates formed during the
heat treatment. The presence of zirconium at grain boundaries in the as-built
condition is known to be susceptible to enhance hot cracking, while its absence
in the heat-treated microstructure strongly suggests that this element has no
major effect on the creep resistance. Based on our observations, we propose
alloy design guidelines to at the same time avoid hot cracking during
fabrication and achieve the required creep performance after heat-treatment.

undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is called an orientation of $G$. The resulting
directed graph is denoted by $\overrightarrow{G}$. A strong orientation is one
in which every vertex is reachable from every other vertex via a directed path.
The diameter of $\overrightarrow{G}$, i.e., the maximum distance from one
vertex to another, depends on the particular orientation. The minimum diameter
among all possible orientations is called the oriented diameter
$\overrightarrow{\text{diam}}(G)$ of $G$. Let $n,k$ be two integers with $1
\leq k < n$. In the realm of interconnection networks of processing elements,
an $(n,k)$-star graph $S_{n,k}$ offers a topology that circumvents the lack of
scalability of $n$-star graphs $S_n$. In this paper, we present a strong
orientation for $S_{n,k}$ that combines approaches suggested by Cheng and
Lipman [Journal of Interconnection Networks (2002)] for $S_{n,k}$ with the one
proposed by Fujita [The First International Symposium on Computing and
Networking (CANDAR 2013)] for $S_n$. Next, we propose a distributed routing
algorithm for $\overrightarrow{S_{n,k}}$ inspired by an algorithm proposed by
Kumar, Rajendraprasad and Sudeep [Discrete Applied Mathematics (2021)] for
$\overrightarrow{S_n}$. With the aid of both the orientation scheme and the
routing algorithm, we show that $\overrightarrow{\text{diam}}(S_{n,k}) \leq
\lfloor \frac{n+k}{2} \rfloor + 2k + 6 - \delta(n,k)$ where $\delta(n,k)$ is a
non-negative function. The function $\delta(n,k)$ takes on values $2k-n$, $0$,
and $\left\lfloor \frac{n-3k}{2} \right\rfloor$ respectively for three disjoint
intervals $k>\frac{n}{2}$, $\frac{n}{3} < k \leq \frac{n}{2}$ and $k\leq
\frac{n}{3}$. For every value of $n$, $k$, our upper bound performs better than
all known bounds in literature.

of a contemporary online sports-betting exchange: such exchanges, closely
related to the exchange mechanisms at the heart of major financial markets,
have revolutionized the gambling industry in the past 20 years, but gathering
sufficiently large quantities of rich and temporally high-resolution data from
real exchanges - i.e., the sort of data that is needed in large quantities for
Deep Learning - is often very expensive, and sometimes simply impossible; this
creates a need for a plausibly realistic synthetic data generator, which is
what this simulation now provides. The simulator, named the ""Bristol Betting
Exchange"" (BBE), is intended as a common platform, a data-source and
experimental test-bed, for researchers studying the application of AI and
machine learning (ML) techniques to issues arising in betting exchanges; and,
as far as I have been able to determine, BBE is the first of its kind: a free
open-source agent-based simulation model consisting not only of a
sports-betting exchange, but also a minimal simulation model of racetrack
sporting events (e.g., horse-races or car-races) about which bets may be made,
and a population of simulated bettors who each form their own private
evaluation of odds and place bets on the exchange before and - crucially -
during the race itself (i.e., so-called ""in-play"" betting) and whose betting
opinions change second-by-second as each race event unfolds. BBE is offered as
a proof-of-concept system that enables the generation of large high-resolution
data-sets for automated discovery or improvement of profitable strategies for
betting on sporting events via the application of AI/ML and advanced data
analytics techniques. This paper offers an extensive survey of relevant
literature and explains the motivation and design of BBE, and presents brief
illustrative results.

spatiotemporal data generated every day. Addressing reachability queries on
such datasets is important for a wide range of applications (surveillance,
public health, social networks, etc.) A spatiotemporal reachability query
identifies whether a physical item (or information etc.) could have been
transferred from the source object $O_S$ to the target object $O_T$ during a
time interval $I$ (either directly, or through a chain of intermediate
transfers). In previous research on spatiotemporal reachability queries, the
number of such transfers is not limited, and the weight of a piece of
transferred information remains the same. This paper introduces novel
reachability queries, which assume a scenario of information decay. Such
queries arise when the value of information that travels through the chain of
intermediate objects decreases with each transfer. To address such queries
efficiently over large spatiotemporal datasets, we introduce the RICCdecay
algorithm. Further, the decay scenario leads to an important extension: if
there are many different sources of information, the aggregate value of
information an object can obtain varies. As a result, we introduce a top-k
reachability problem, identifying the k objects with the highest accumulated
information. We also present the RICCtopK algorithm that can efficiently
compute top-k reachability with transfer decay queries. An experimental
evaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithms over previous
approaches.

advantage of both the predictability of nonparametric machine learning model
and the interpretability of economic model. Secondly, we propose a multi-period
dynamic pricing algorithm to maximize the overall profit of a perishable

approaches that use the deterministic demand, we model the uncertainty of
counterfactual demand since it inevitably has randomness in the prediction
process. Based on the stochastic model, we derive a sequential pricing strategy
by Markov decision process, and design a two-stage algorithm to solve it. The
proposed algorithm is very efficient. It reduces the time complexity from
exponential to polynomial. Experimental results show the advantages of our
pricing algorithm, and the proposed framework has been successfully deployed to
the well-known e-commerce fresh retail scenario - Freshippo.

constraints are nonconvex and possibly complicated, but allow for a fast
computation of projections onto this nonconvex set. Typical problem classes
which satisfy this requirement are optimization problems with disjunctive
constraints (like complementarity or cardinality constraints) as well as
optimization problems over sets of matrices which have to satisfy additional

constraints explicitly in the constraints and to penalize only the remaining
constraints by an augmented Lagrangian function. The resulting subproblems are
then solved with the aid of a problem-tailored nonmonotone projected gradient
method. The corresponding convergence theory allows for an inexact solution of
these subproblems. Nevertheless, the overall algorithm computes so-called
Mordukhovich-stationary points of the original problem under a mild asymptotic
regularity condition, which is generally weaker than most of the respective
available problem-tailored constraint qualifications. Extensive numerical
experiments addressing complementarity- and cardinality-constrained

overlapping items, a setting that contrasts typical cross-domain RS that has
either overlapping users or items. Different from categorical item indices,

therefore naturally generalize to any unseen items. In terms of users, ZESRec
builds upon recent advances on sequential RS to represent users using their
interactions with items, thereby generalizing to unseen users as well. We study

diversity requirements of different users, i.e. the minimum rate requirement
for cellular user and the reliability requirement for D2D user, we attempt to
maximize the cellular user's throughput whilst ensuring a chance constraint for
D2D user. Then, a robust resource allocation framework is proposed for solving
the highly intractable chance constraint about D2D reliability requirement,
where the CSI uncertainties are represented as a deterministic set and the
reliability requirement is enforced to hold for any uncertain CSI within it.
Then, a symmetrical-geometry-based learning approach is developed to model the
uncertain CSI into polytope, ellipsoidal and box. After that, we derive the
robust counterpart of the chance constraint under these uncertainty sets as the
computation convenient convex sets. To overcome the conservatism of the
symmetrical-geometry-based uncertainty sets, we develop a support vector
clustering (SVC)-based approach to model uncertain CSI as a compact convex
uncertainty set. Based on that, the chance constraint of D2D is converted into
a linear convex set. Then, we develop a bisection search-based power allocation
algorithm for solving the resource allocation in D2D underlaying cellular

We present the first detailed analysis of the astrophysical parameters

spectra, as well as archival TESS data, of HD 152384. In addition, we use
literature photometric data to construct a detailed spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the star. Results. The photospheric absorption lines in
the spectrum of HD 152384 are characteristic of a A0 V star, for which we
derive a stellar mass of 2.1 +/- 0.1 M_sun and a stellar age > 4.5 Myr.
Superimposed on the photospheric absorption, the optical spectrum also displays
double-peaked emission lines of Ca II, Fe I, Mg I and Si I, typical of
circumstellar disks. Notably, all Hydrogen and Helium lines appear strictly in
absorption. A toy model shows that the observed emission line profiles can be
reproduced by emission from a compact (radius < 0.3 au) disk seen at an
inclination of ~24 degrees. Further evidence for the presence of circumstellar
material comes from the detection of a moderate infrared excess in the SED,
similar to those found in extreme debris disk systems. Conclusions. We conclude
that HD 152384 is surrounded by a tenuous circumstellar disk which, although
rich in refractory elements, is highly depleted of volatile elements. To the
best of our knowledge such a disk is unique within the group of young stars.
However, it is reminiscent of the disks seen in some white dwarfs, which have
been attributed to the disruption of rocky planets. We suggest that the disk
around HD 152384 may have a similar origin and may be due to collisions in a
newly formed planetary system.

inherently a property tied to the lower temperature ranges of the phase diagram

of ferroelectric AlScN, low temperature has to be seen as a purely relative
term, since its ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition temperature is
confirmed to surpass 1100{\deg}C and thus the transition temperature of
virtually any other thin film ferroelectric. We arrived at this conclusion
through investigating the structural stability of 0.4 - 2 ${\mu}$m thick
Al$_{0.73}$Sc$_{0.27}$N films grown on Mo bottom electrodes via in situ
high-temperature X-ray diffraction and permittivity measurements. Our studies
reveal the wurtzite-type structure of Al$_{0.73}$Sc$_{0.27}$N is conserved
during the entire 1100{\deg}C annealing cycle, apparent through a constant c
over a lattice parameter ratio. In situ permittivity measurements performed up
to 1000{\deg}C strongly support this conclusion and include what could be the
onset of a diverging permittivity only at the very upper end of the measurement
interval. Our in situ measurements are well-supported by ex situ (scanning)
transmission electron microscopy and polarization and capacity hysteresis
measurements. These results confirm the structural stability on the
sub-${\mu}$m scale next to the stability of the inscribed polarization during
the complete 1100{\deg}C annealing treatment. Thus, AlScN is the first readily
available thin film ferroelectric with a temperature stability that surpasses
virtually all thermal budgets occurring in microtechnology, be it during

can be tailored to operate either on external degrees of freedom leading to
atomic crystallization for thermal atoms and supersolids for a quantum

the genetic structure of T.polycolpus among both hosts and sampling sites. The
distribution of full-sibs obtainedamong the sampling sites was used to estimate
individual dispersal distances within families. Our results showed that T.
polycolpus sibs tend to be aggregated within sites but not withinhost
individuals. We detected important upstream-to-downstream dispersal events of
T.polycolpusbetween sites (modal distance: 25.4 km; 95% CI [22.9, 27.7]),
becoming scarcer as the geographic distance from their family core location

become an indispensable tool in material research. However, as the s-SNOM
technique marches into the far-infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) regimes,
emerging experiments sometimes produce puzzling results. For example, anomalies
in the near-field optical contrast have been widely reported. In this Letter,
we systematically investigate a series of extreme subwavelength metallic
nanostructures via s-SNOM near-field imaging in the GHz to THz frequency range.
We find that the near-field material contrast is greatly impacted by the
lateral size of the nanostructure, while the spatial resolution is practically
independent of it. The contrast is also strongly affected by the connectivity
of the metallic structures to a larger metallic ground plane. The observed
effect can be largely explained by a quasi-electrostatic analysis. We also
compare the THz s-SNOM results to those of the mid-IR regime, where the
size-dependence becomes significant only for smaller structures. Our results
reveal that the quantitative analysis of the near-field optical material

We prove a variational formula for the spreading speeds in any direction, and

involves newly introduced notions of bounded and unbounded directions of the
initial support. The results hold for a large class of reaction terms and for
solutions emanating from initial conditions with general unbounded support,

compactly supported or almost-planar initial conditions. We also prove some
results of independent interest on some conditions guaranteeing the spreading
of solutions with large initial support and the link between these conditions

of ODE and PDE methods, as well as some geometric arguments. The results are
sharp and counterexamples are shown when the assumptions are not all fulfilled.

mechanism. It not only transparently superimposes copyright patterns on

However, existing RVW algorithms mostly construct the reversible mapping
mechanism for a specific visible watermarking scheme, which is not versatile.
Hence, we propose a generic RVW framework to accommodate various visible
watermarking schemes. In particular, we obtain a reconstruction data packet --
the compressed difference image between the watermarked image and the original
host image, which is embedded into the watermarked image via any conventional
reversible data hiding method to facilitate the blind recovery of the host
image. The key is to achieve compact compression of the difference image for
efficient embedding of the reconstruction data packet. To this end, we propose
regularized Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) coding, where the difference image is
smoothed via the graph Laplacian regularizer for more efficient compression and
then encoded by multi-resolution GFTs in an approximately optimal manner.
Experimental results show that the proposed framework has much better
versatility than state-of-the-art methods. Due to the small amount of auxiliary
information to be embedded, the visual quality of the watermarked image is also
higher.

Combining Monte Carlo methods with unsupervised training of neural networks has
recently been proposed as a promising approach to overcome the curse of

individual molecules at a moderately scaling computational cost. These methods
currently do not exploit the regularity exhibited by wavefunctions with respect
to their molecular geometries. Inspired by recent successful applications of
deep transfer learning in machine translation and computer vision tasks, we
attempt to leverage this regularity by introducing a weight-sharing constraint
when optimizing neural network-based models for different molecular geometries.
That is, we restrict the optimization process such that up to 95 percent of
weights in a neural network model are in fact equal across varying molecular

considering sets of nuclear geometries of the same molecule by an order of

trace. Quantitative monitors are approximate: with every finite prefix, they
can improve their estimate of the infinite trace's unknown property value.
Consequently, quantitative monitors can be compared with regard to a
precision-cost trade-off: better approximations of the property value require
more monitor resources, such as states (in the case of finite-state monitors)
or registers, and additional resources yield better approximations. We
introduce a formal framework for quantitative and approximate monitoring, show

The TOPoS project has the goal to find and analyse Turn-Off (TO)
stars of extremely low metallicity. To select the targets for spectroscopic
follow-up at high spectral resolution, we have relied on low-resolution spectra
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Aims. In this paper we use the metallicity
estimates we have obtained from our analysis of the SDSS spectra to construct
the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the Milky Way, with special
emphasis on its metal-weak tail. The goal is to provide the underlying
distribution out of which the TOPoS sample was extracted. Methods. We make use
of SDSS photometry, Gaia photometry and distance estimates derived from the
Gaia parallaxes to derive a metallicity estimate for a large sample of over 24
million TO stars. This sample is used to derive the metallicity bias of the
sample for which SDSS spectra are available. Results. We determined that the
spectroscopic sample is strongly biased in favour of metal-poor stars, as
intended. A comparison with the unbiased photometric sample allows to correct
for the selection bias. We select a sub-sample of stars with reliable
parallaxes for which we combine the SDSS radial velocities with Gaia proper
motions and parallaxes to compute actions and orbital parameters in the
Galactic potential. This allows us to characterize the stars dynamically, and
in particular to select a sub-sample that belongs to the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus
(GSE) accretion event. We are thus able to provide also the MDF of GSE.
Conclusions. The metal-weak tail derived in our study is very similar to that
derived in the H3 survey and in the Hamburg/ESO Survey. This allows us to
average the three MDFs and provide an error bar for each metallicity bin.
Inasmuch the GSE structure is representative of the progenitor galaxy that
collided with the Milky Way, that galaxy appears to be strongly deficient in
metal-poor stars compared to the Milky Way, suggesting that the metal-weak tail
of the latter has been largely formed by accretion of low mass galaxies rather
than massive galaxies, such as the GSE progenitor.

differences observed between O-bearing and N-bearing species in L1498 and L1544
are due to the different physical structure of these cores, which in turn is a
consequence of their evolutionary stage, with L1498 being younger than L1544.

highly correlated measurements of wireless channels, which relies on reciprocal

security technique for Internet of Things (IoT). However, it is challenging to
extract common features in frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems as uplink
and downlink transmissions operate at different frequency bands whose channel
frequency responses are not reciprocal any more. Existing PKG methods for FDD
systems have many limitations, i.e., high overhead and security problems. This
paper proposes a novel PKG scheme that uses the feature mapping function
between different frequency bands obtained by deep learning to make two users
generate highly similar channel features in FDD systems. In particular, this is
the first time to apply deep learning for PKG in FDD systems. We first prove
the existence of the band feature mapping function for a given environment and
a feedforward network with a single hidden layer can approximate the mapping
function. Then a Key Generation neural Network (KGNet) is proposed for
reciprocal channel feature construction, and a key generation scheme based on
the KGNet is also proposed. Numerical results verify the excellent performance
of the KGNet-based key generation scheme in terms of randomness, key generation
ratio, and key error rate. Besides, the overhead analysis shows that the method
proposed in this paper can be used for resource-contrained IoT devices in FDD
systems.

disrupted. Based on the common-mode equivalent model, a frequency domain

while transportation is being executed. Planning transportation online helps to
effectively respond to unforeseen events that may affect the original

for each heuristic using data that simulate a realistic scenario, designed on

revealed that the proposed method was able to learn effective patterns of

text recognizers adopt an encoder-decoder architecture where text images are
first converted to representative features and then a sequence of characters
via `sequential decoding'. However, scene text images suffer from rich noises
of different sources such as complex background and geometric distortions which
often confuse the decoder and lead to incorrect alignment of visual features at
noisy decoding time steps. This paper presents I2C2W, a novel scene text
recognition technique that is tolerant to geometric and photometric degradation
by decomposing scene text recognition into two inter-connected tasks. The first
task focuses on image-to-character (I2C) mapping which detects a set of
character candidates from images based on different alignments of visual
features in an non-sequential way. The second task tackles character-to-word
(C2W) mapping which recognizes scene text by decoding words from the detected
character candidates. The direct learning from character semantics (instead of
noisy image features) corrects falsely detected character candidates
effectively which improves the final text recognition accuracy greatly.
Extensive experiments over nine public datasets show that the proposed I2C2W
outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins for challenging scene text
datasets with various curvature and perspective distortions. It also achieves
very competitive recognition performance over multiple normal scene text
datasets.

ground truth in conjunction with simulated observation processes (virtual

data-driven methods to assess the epidemic situation. We conclude that epidemic
monitoring, simulation, and forecasting are wicked problems, as applying a
conventional data-driven approach to a complex system with non-linear dynamics,
network effects, and uncertainty can be misleading. Nevertheless, some of the
errors can be corrected for, using scientific knowledge of the spreading
dynamics and the measurement process. We conclude that such corrections should
generally be part of epidemic monitoring, modeling, and forecasting efforts.

the inherent difficulty in the creation of these displays and their
impracticability in general use due to cost, performance, and lack of

striking innovations in this field, there has been a dereliction of duty of
software developers and researchers in terms of developing software to best
utilize these displays.
  This paper will seek to identify what areas of future software development
could mitigate this dereliction. To achieve this goal, the paper will first
examine the current state of the art and perform a comparative analysis on
different types of 3D displays, from this analysis a clear researcher gap
exists in terms of software development for Light field displays which are the
current state of the art of non-HMD-based 3D displays.

naming protocols on top of IPFS, such as IPNS and DNSlink, that map a constant

these mappings. Nevertheless, IPNS relies on a cryptographic key pair that

protocol provides content authenticity without imposing any security

performance on anomaly detection tasks due to their excellent ability to fit
complex data in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose a novel
autoencoder-based model, named StackVAE-G that can significantly bring the
efficiency and interpretability to multivariate time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we utilize the similarities across the time series channels by
the stacking block-wise reconstruction with a weight-sharing scheme to reduce
the size of learned models and also relieve the overfitting to unknown noises
in the training data. We also leverage a graph learning module to learn a
sparse adjacency matrix to explicitly capture the stable interrelation
structure among multiple time series channels for the interpretable pattern
reconstruction of interrelated channels. Combining these two modules, we
introduce the stacking block-wise VAE (variational autoencoder) with GNN (graph
neural network) model for multivariate time series anomaly detection. We
conduct extensive experiments on three commonly used public datasets, showing
that our model achieves comparable (even better) performance with the
state-of-the-art modelsand meanwhile requires much less computation and memory
cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the adjacency matrix learned by our
model accurately captures the interrelation among multiple channels, and can
provide valuable information for failure diagnosis applications.

adapting the system configuration, such that the system goal can be reached
again. Classical approaches typically use a set of pre-defined faults for which
corresponding recovery actions are defined manually. This is not possible for
modern hybrid systems which are characterized by frequent changes. Instead,
AI-based approaches are needed which leverage on a model of the non-faulty
system and which search for a set of reconfiguration operations which will
establish a valid behavior again.
  This work presents a novel algorithm which solves three main challenges: (i)
Only a model of the non-faulty system is needed, i.e. the faulty behavior does
not need to be modeled. (ii) It discretizes and reduces the search space which
originally is too large -- mainly due to the high number of continuous system
variables and control signals. (iii) It uses a SAT solver for propositional
logic for two purposes: First, it defines the binary concept of validity.
Second, it implements the search itself -- sacrificing the optimal solution for
a quick identification of an arbitrary solution. It is shown that the approach
is able to reconfigure faults on simulated process engineering systems.

flows. Furthermore, we show that the implicit Euler discretization of gradient
flows gives rise to a nonlinear power method of the proximal operator and prove
their convergence to nonlinear eigenfunctions. Finally, we prove that
$\Gamma$-convergence of functionals implies convergence of their ground states,
which is important for discrete approximations.

set of at least $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in general position contains a

article, we present a SAT model based on acyclic chirotopes (oriented matroids)
to investigate Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres numbers in small dimensions. To solve the
SAT instances we use modern SAT solvers and all our unsatisfiability results
are verified using DRAT certificates. We show $g^{(3)}(7) = 13$, $g^{(4)}(8)
\le 13$, and $g^{(5)}(9) \le 13$, which are the first improvements for decades.
For the setting of $k$-holes (i.e., $k$-gons with no other points in the convex
hull), where $h^{(d)}(k)$ denotes the minimum number $n$ such that every set of
at least $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in general position contains a $k$-hole,
we show $h^{(3)}(7) \le 14$, $h^{(4)}(8) \le 13$, and $h^{(5)}(9) \le 13$.
Moreover, all obtained bounds are sharp in the setting of acyclic chirotopes
and we conjecture them to be sharp also in the original setting of point sets.
As a byproduct, we verify previously known bounds. In particular, we present
the first computer-assisted proof of the upper bound $h^{(2)}(6)\le g^{(2)}(9)
\le 1717$ by Gerken (2008).

obtained by deep learning networks. Still, object detection is considered one
of the leading open issues within computer vision.
  The current scenario is constantly evolving, and new models and techniques

drawbacks appear regarding detecting small objects, which correspond mainly to
the vehicles that appear in the road scenes. All this means that new solutions
that try to improve the low detection rate of small elements are essential.
Among the different emerging research lines, this work focuses on the detection

applying super-resolution processes based on detections performed by
convolutional neural networks \emph{(CNN)}. The neural network is integrated
with processes that are in charge of increasing the resolution of the images to
improve the object detection performance. This solution has been tested for a

remained active for about seven months. Owing to various constraints it was
monitored by NICER only during the decay phase of the outburst for about four
months. The NICER observations were primarily in the soft state with a brief
excursion to the hard intermediate state. While the soft state spectrum was
dominated by thermal disk emission, the hard intermediate state spectrum had
maximum contribution from the thermal Comptonization. Almost all
intermediate-state power spectra had a Type-C low frequency quasi-periodic
oscillation (within 4 - 10 Hz), often accompanied by a harmonic component. The
frequency of these oscillations increased and the fractional rms decreased with
inner-disk temperature suggesting a geometric origin. One observation in the
middle of the outburst during the hard intermediate state had two
non-harmonically related peaks. While one of them was definitely a Type-C QPO,
the identification of the other one is uncertain. The rms spectra during the
intermediate state had a hard shape from above 1 keV. Below 1 keV the shape
could not be constrained in most cases, while only a few observations showed a
rise in amplitude.

management framework in modern information systems research. However, despite
DCTs significant contributions, its strength and core focus are essentially in
its use for historical firm performance explanation. Furthermore, valuable
contributions have been made by several researchers in order to extend the DCT
to fit the constantly changing IT environments and other imperative drivers for
competitive performance. However, no DCT extension has been developed which
allows firms to integrally assess their current state of maturity in order to
derive imperative steps for further performance enhancements. In light of
empirical advancement, this paper aims to develop a strategic alignment model
for IT flexibility and dynamic capabilities and empirically validates proposed
hypotheses using correlation and regression analyses on a large data sample of
322 international firms. We conjecture that the combined synergetic effect of
the underlying dimensions of a firms IT flexibility architecture and dynamic
capabilities enables organizations to cope with changing environmental
conditions and drive competitive firm performance. Findings of this study
suggest that there is a significant positive relationship between the firms
degree of strategic alignment defined as the degree of balance between all
dimensions and competitive firm performance. Strategic alignment can,
therefore, be seen as an important condition that significantly influences a
firms competitive advantage in constantly changing environments. The proposed
framework helps firms assess and improve their maturity and alignment of IT

The set of constraints is derived. It was found that a suitable superposition
of those constraints is the generator of the infinitesimal transformations of
the time coordinate $t\equiv x^0$ and serves as the Hamiltonian which gives the
correct equations of motion. Besides that, the system satisfies the mass shell
constraint, $p^\mu p_\mu - m^2 = 0$, which is the generator of the worldsheet
reparametrizations, where the momenta $p_\mu$, $\mu=0,1,2,3$, generate
infinitesimal changes of the particle's position $X^\mu$ in spacetime.
Consequently, the Hamiltonian contains $p_0$, which upon quantization becomes
the operator $- i \partial/\partial T$, occurring on the r.h.s. of the
Wheeler-DeWitt euqtion. Here the role of time has the particle coordinate $X^0
\equiv T$, which is a distinct concept than the spacetime coordinate $x^0

quadratic form of the momenta is cast into the form that instead of the metric

generalized HDE and different DE models. In this regard, we consider several
entropic dark energy models - like Tsallis entropic DE, the R\'{e}nyi entropic

equivalent with the generalized HDE. Such equivalence between the entropic DE

that is very close to semi-Poisson statistics - the latter being usually
associated to the critical point of ""Anderson"" localization-delocalization
transitions. We demonstrate that all the eigenstates - including two polaritons
and a continuum of dark states - are multifractal, which indicates the
existence of a critical ""semi-localized"" phase for all values of the
light-matter coupling strength, where dark states are localized over multiple,
arbitrarily-distant sites. By computing the escape probability from an initial
site, we find that the system has a peculiar diffusive-like behavior with an
escape probability growing linearly with time for any finite coupling strength,
and that the escape rate can be controlled by selecting the energy of the
initial site. The escape rate averaged over the disorder configurations is
found to exhibit a maximum for intermediate coupling strengths, before
saturating at a lower value in the collective strong coupling limit - a ""cavity
protection"" effect. Surprisingly, we show that the saturation value increases
with the disorder, indicating that the cavity does not only protect transport
against disorder but can also turn the latter into an ally improving transport.
We finally investigate the system in a two-terminal configuration, and show
that the steady-state excitation current exhibits similar features as the
escape probability, thereby extending our cavity-protected transport scenario
to out-of-equilibrium situations. We finally demonstrate that dark states can
provide the major contribution to long-distance transport in disordered

(AD). Thus, specialists can begin preventive treatment as soon as possible.
They demand fast and precise assessment in the diagnosis of AD in the earliest
and hardest to detect stages. The main objective of this work is to develop a
system that automatically detects the presence of the disease in sagittal
magnetic resonance images (MRI), which are not generally used. Sagittal MRIs
from ADNI and OASIS data sets were employed. Experiments were conducted using
Transfer Learning (TL) techniques in order to achieve more accurate results.
There are two main conclusions to be drawn from this work: first, the damages
related to AD and its stages can be distinguished in sagittal MRI and, second,
the results obtained using DL models with sagittal MRIs are similar to the
state-of-the-art, which uses the horizontal-plane MRI. Although sagittal-plane
MRIs are not commonly used, this work proved that they were, at least, as
effective as MRI from other planes at identifying AD in early stages. This
could pave the way for further research. Finally, one should bear in mind that
in certain fields, obtaining the examples for a data set can be very expensive.
This study proved that DL models could be built in these fields, whereas TL is
an essential tool for completing the task with fewer examples.

been combined with active contours replacing the user in the process of contour

dependence on parameters of the energy functional and initialization. However,
prior works did not aim for automatic initialization which is addressed here.
In addition to manual initialization, current methods are highly sensitive to
initial location and fail to delineate borders accurately. We propose a fully
automatic image segmentation method to address problems of manual
initialization, insufficient capture range, and poor convergence to boundaries,
in addition to the problem of assignment of energy functional parameters. We
train two CNNs, which predict active contour weighting parameters and generate
a ground truth mask to extract Distance Transform (DT) and an initialization
circle. Distance transform is used to form a vector field pointing from each
pixel of the image towards the closest point on the boundary, the size of which
is equal to the Euclidean distance map. We evaluate our method on four publicly
available datasets including two building instance segmentation datasets,
Vaihingen and Bing huts, and two mammography image datasets, INBreast and
DDSM-BCRP. Our approach outperforms latest research by 0.59 ans 2.39 percent in

By solving the

An analysis of the candidate gap functions in orbital and quasiparticle band
basis reveals that an inter-orbital singlet pairing of even parity is in
agreement with experimental observations. It reconciles in particular the
occurrence of a two-component order parameter with the presence of line-nodes
of quasiparticles along the c-axis in the superconducting phase. The strong
angular dependence of the gap along the Fermi surface is in stark contrast to
its quasi-locality when expressed in the orbital basis. We identify local
inter-orbital spin correlations as the driving force for the pairing and thus
reveal the continuation of Hund's physics into the superconducting phase.

representations of dynamical systems. They are notable for the ability to
include a deterministic component of the system and a stochastic one to
represent random unknown factors. However, this makes learning SDEs much more
challenging than ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this paper, we
propose a data driven approach where parameters of the SDE are represented by a
neural network with a built-in SDE integration scheme. The loss function is
based on a maximum likelihood criterion, under order one Markov Gaussian
assumptions. The algorithm is applied to the geometric brownian motion and a
stochastic version of the Lorenz-63 model. The latter is particularly hard to
handle due to the presence of a stochastic component that depends on the state.
The algorithm performance is attested using different simulations results.
Besides, comparisons are performed with the reference gradient matching method
used for non linear drift estimation, and a neural networks-based method, that
does not consider the stochastic term.

up with the enormity of the available information. So is statistics, the queen
of science. Big data are particularly relevant to spatio-temporal statistics,
thanks to much-improved technology in satellite based remote sensing and
Geographical Information Systems. However, none of the existing approaches seem
to meet the simultaneous demand of reality emulation and cheap computation. In
this article, with the Levy random fields as the starting point, e construct a
new Bayesian nonparametric, nonstationary and nonseparable dynamic spatio-
temporal model with the additional realistic property that the lagged
spatio-temporal correlations converge to zero as the lag tends to infinity.
Although our Bayesian model seems to be intricately structured and is
variable-dimensional with respect to each time index, we are able to devise a
fast and efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for
Bayesian inference. Our simulation experiment brings out quite encouraging
performance from our Bayesian Levy-dynamic approach. We finally apply our
Bayesian Levy-dynamic model and methods to a sea surface temperature dataset
consisting of 139,300 data points in space and time. Although not big data in
the true sense, this is a large and highly structured data by any standard.
Even for this large and complex data, our parallel MCMC algorithm, implemented
on 80 processors, generated 110,000 MCMC realizations from the Levy-dynamic
posterior within a single day, and the resultant Bayesian posterior predictive
analysis turned out to be encouraging. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect
that with significantly more computing resources, it is feasible to analyse
terabytes of spatio-temporal data with our new model and methods.

the Prandtl number, is much smaller than unity in stellar convection zones.
Aims: To study the statistics of convective flows and energy transport as
functions of the Prandtl number. Methods: Three-dimensional numerical
simulations convection in Cartesian geometry are used. The convection zone (CZ)
is embedded between two stably stratified layers. Statistics and transport
properties of up- and downflows are studied separately. Results: The rms
velocity increases with decreasing Prandtl number. At the same time the filling
factor of downflows decreases and leads to stronger downflows at lower Prandtl
numbers, and to a strong dependence of overshooting on the Prandtl number.
Velocity power spectra do not show marked changes as a function of Prandtl
number. At the highest Reynolds numbers the velocity power spectra are
compatible with the Bolgiano-Obukhov $k^{-11/5}$ scaling. The horizontally
averaged convected energy flux ($\overline{F}_{\rm conv}$) is independent of
the Prandtl number within the CZ. However, the upflows (downflows) are the
dominant contribution to the convected flux at low (high) Prandtl number. These
results are similar to those from Rayleigh-Ben\'ard convection in the low
Prandtl number regime where convection is vigorously turbulent but inefficient
at transporting energy. Conclusions: The current results indicate a strong
dependence of convective overshooting and energy flux on the Prandtl number.
Numerical simulations of astrophysical convection often use Prandtl number of
unity. The current results suggest that this can lead to misleading results and
that the astrophysically relevant low Prandtl number regime is qualitatively
different from the parameters regimes explored in typical simulations.

stochastically tangled magnetic field whose energy is close to equipartition
with the energy of the turbulent motions \cite{zweibel1997, Vacca}. In the
cluster cores, the temperatures remain anomalously high compared to what might
be expected considering that the radiative cooling time is short relative to
the Hubble time \cite{cowie1977,fabian1994}. While feedback from the central
active galactic nuclei (AGN) \cite{fabian2012,birzan2012,churazov2000} is
believed to provide most of the heating, there has been a long debate as to
whether conduction of heat from the bulk to the core can help the core to reach
the observed temperatures \cite{narayan2001,ruszkowski2002,kunz2011}, given the
presence of tangled magnetic fields. Interestingly, evidence of very sharp
temperature gradients in structures like cold fronts implies a high degree of
suppression of thermal conduction \cite{markevitch2007}. To address the problem
of thermal conduction in a magnetized and turbulent plasma, we have created a
replica of such a system in a laser laboratory experiment. Our data show a
reduction of local heat transport by two orders of magnitude or more, leading
to strong temperature variations on small spatial scales, as is seen in cluster

addition to the conventional weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). The
Poisson fluctuations of the PBH number density produce the isocurvature
perturbations which can dominate the matter power spectrum at small scales and
enhance the early structure formation. We study how the WIMP annihilation from
those early formed structures can affect the CMB (in particular the E-mode
polarization anisotropies and $y$-type spectral distortions) and global 21cm
signals. Our studies would be of particular interest for the light (sub-GeV)
WIMP scenarios which have been less explored compared with the mixed DM
scenarios consisting of PBHs and heavy ($\gtrsim 1$ GeV) WIMPs. For instance,
for the self-annihilating DM mass $m_{\chi}=1$ MeV and the thermally averaged
annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-30} \rm cm^3/s$,
the latest Planck CMB data requires the PBH fraction with respect to the whole
DM to be at most ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ for the sub-solar mass PBHs and an even
tighter bound (by a factor $\sim 5$) can be obtained from the global 21-cm
measurements.

verification systems robust in the real world settings. The context of
detecting live vs. spoofed face images may differ significantly in the target
domain, when compared to that of labeled source domain where the model is
trained. Such difference may be caused due to new and unknown spoof types,
illumination conditions, scene backgrounds, among many others. These varieties
of differences make the target a compound domain, thus calling for the problem
of the unsupervised compound domain adaptation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the compound domain assumption for the task of face
anti-spoofing, for the first time in this work. To this end, we propose a
memory augmentation method for adapting the source model to the target domain
in a domain aware manner. The adaptation process is further improved by using
the curriculum learning and the domain agnostic source network training
approaches. The proposed method successfully adapts to the compound target
domain consisting multiple new spoof types. Our experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the

in a teleoperated system and usually degrades the operation performance. The
effects of such misalignment have not been fully investigated for eye-in-hand
systems - systems that have the camera (eye) mounted to the end-effector (hand)
to gain compactness in confined spaces such as in endoscopic surgery. This
paper provides a systematic study on the effects of the camera frame
misalignment in a teleoperated eye-in-hand robot and proposes a simple
correction method in the view display. A simulation is designed to compare the
effects of the misalignment under different conditions. Users are asked to move
a rigid body from its initial position to the specified target position via
teleoperation, with different levels of misalignment simulated. It is found
that misalignment between the input motion and the output view is much more
difficult to compensate by the operators when it is in the orthogonal direction
(~40s) compared with the opposite direction (~20s). An experiment on a real
concentric tube robot with an eye-in-hand configuration is also conducted.
Users are asked to telemanipulate the robot to complete a pick-and-place task.
Results show that with the correction enabled, there is a significant
improvement in the operation performance in terms of completion time (mean
40.6%, median 38.6%), trajectory length (mean 34.3%, median 28.1%), difficulty
(50.5%), unsteadiness (49.4%), and mental stress (60.9%).

pressure is key to reaching the goal of net energy production. The
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model is used to self-consistently calculate the
effects the plasma pressure induces on the magnetic field used to confine the
plasma. Such MHD calculations serve as input for the assessment of a number of
important physics questions. The VMEC code is the most widely used to evaluate
3D ideal-MHD equilibria, as prominently present in stellarators. However,
considering the computational cost, it is rarely used in large-scale or online
applications. Access to fast MHD equilbria is a challenging problem in fusion
research, one which machine learning could effectively address. In this paper,
we present artificial neural network (NN) models able to quickly compute the
equilibrium magnetic field of W7-X. Magnetic configurations that extensively
cover the device operational space, and plasma profiles with volume averaged
normalized plasma pressure $\langle \beta \rangle$ ($\beta$ = $\frac{2 \mu_0

set. By using convolutional layers, the spectral representation of the magnetic
flux surfaces can be efficiently computed with a single network. To discover
better models, a Bayesian hyper-parameter search is carried out, and 3D
convolutional neural networks are found to outperform feed-forward
fully-connected neural networks. The achieved normalized root-mean-squared
error ranges from 1% to 20% across the different scenarios. The model inference
time for a single equilibrium is on the order of milliseconds. Finally, this
work shows the feasibility of a fast NN drop-in surrogate model for VMEC, and
it opens up new operational scenarios where target applications could make use

systems where each genotype can be represented as a bitstring of length $L$, an
overview of possible evolutionary trajectories is provided by the $L$-cube
graph with nodes labeled by genotypes and edges directed toward the genotype
with higher fitness. Peaks (sinks in the graphs) are important since a
population can get stranded at a suboptimal peak. The fitness landscape is
defined by the fitness values of all genotypes in the system. Some notion of
curvature is necessary for a more complete analysis of the landscapes,
including the effect of recombination. The shape approach uses triangulations
(shapes) induced by fitness landscapes. The main topic for this work is the
interplay between peak patterns and shapes. Because of constraints on the
shapes for $L=3$ imposed by peaks, there are in total 25 possible combinations
of peak patterns and shapes. Similar constraints exist for higher $L$.
Specifically, we show that the constraints induced by the staircase
triangulation can be formulated as a condition of {\emph{universal positive
epistasis}}, an order relation on the fitness effects of arbitrary sets of
mutations that respects the inclusion relation between the corresponding
genetic backgrounds. We apply the concept to a large protein fitness landscape

preferences and experience is an important challenge. This paper explores a
novel method to realize this goal in the context of dynamic difficulty
adjustment (DDA). Here the aim is to constantly adapt the content of a game to
the skill level of the player, keeping them engaged by avoiding states that are
either too difficult or too easy. Current systems for DDA rely on expensive
data mining, or on hand-crafted rules designed for particular domains, and
usually adapts to keep players in the flow, leaving no room for the designer to
present content that is purposefully easy or difficult. This paper presents
Fast Bayesian Content Adaption (FBCA), a system for DDA that is agnostic to the
domain and that can target particular difficulties. We deploy this framework in
two different domains: the puzzle game Sudoku, and a simple Roguelike game. By
modifying the acquisition function's optimization, we are reliably able to
present a content with a bespoke difficulty for players with different skill
levels in less than five iterations for Sudoku and fifteen iterations for the
simple Roguelike. Our method significantly outperforms simpler DDA heuristics
with the added benefit of maintaining a model of the user. These results point
towards a promising alternative for content adaption in a variety of different
domains.

the Boltzmann transport theory. The spin accumulations by the CPASS effect
quadratically increase with temperature gradient, and vary with the chemical

finance), customer acquisition is usually a multi-step conversion process of
audiences. For example, an impression->click->purchase process is usually
performed of audiences for e-commerce platforms. However, it is more difficult
to acquire customers in financial advertising (e.g., credit card advertising)
than in traditional advertising. On the one hand, the audience multi-step
conversion path is longer. On the other hand, the positive feedback is sparser
(class imbalance) step by step, and it is difficult to obtain the final
positive feedback due to the delayed feedback of activation. Multi-task
learning is a typical solution in this direction. While considerable multi-task
efforts have been made in this direction, a long-standing challenge is how to
explicitly model the long-path sequential dependence among audience multi-step
conversions for improving the end-to-end conversion. In this paper, we propose
an Adaptive Information Transfer Multi-task (AITM) framework, which models the
sequential dependence among audience multi-step conversions via the Adaptive
Information Transfer (AIT) module. The AIT module can adaptively learn what and
how much information to transfer for different conversion stages. Besides, by
combining the Behavioral Expectation Calibrator in the loss function, the AITM
framework can yield more accurate end-to-end conversion identification. The
proposed framework is deployed in Meituan app, which utilizes it to real-timely
show a banner to the audience with a high end-to-end conversion rate for
Meituan Co-Branded Credit Cards. Offline experimental results on both
industrial and public real-world datasets clearly demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves significantly better performance compared with

risk adjustment formulas used in the U.S. health insurance Marketplaces as well

overcompensated in the Marketplaces. The magnitude of undercompensation when
defining groups with multiple attributes is larger than with single attributes.
No complex groups were found to be consistently under- or overcompensated in

with conditions more favorable for organic synthesis. This work attempts the
synthesis of simple organic molecules, such as hydrocarbons and alcohols, via

detection tasks. Therefore, in this work, a pixel-wise contrastive approach is
proposed to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by using contrastive
loss in pixel-level features on an unlabeled multi-view setting. In this
approach, a Siamese ResUnet is trained to obtain pixel-wise representations and
to align features from shifted positive pairs. Meanwhile, vector quantization
is used to augment the learned features in two branches. The final binary
change map is obtained by subtracting features of one branch from features of
the other branch and using the Rosin thresholding method. To overcome the
effects of regular seasonal changes in binary change maps, we also used an
uncertainty method to enhance the temporal robustness of the proposed approach.
Two homogeneous (OSCD and MUDS) datasets and one heterogeneous (California
Flood) dataset are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.
Results demonstrate improvements in both efficiency and accuracy over the
patch-wise multi-view contrastive method.

manipulation. Most of the current works focus on estimating grasp pose from
point clouds based on an efficient single-shot grasp detection network.
However, due to the lack of geometry awareness of the local grasping area, it
may cause severe collisions and unstable grasp configurations. In this paper,
we propose a two-stage grasp pose refinement network which detects grasps
globally while fine-tuning low-quality grasps and filtering noisy grasps
locally. Furthermore, we extend the 6-DoF grasp with an extra dimension as
grasp width which is critical for collisionless grasping in cluttered scenes.
It takes a single-view point cloud as input and predicts dense and precise
grasp configurations. To enhance the generalization ability, we build a
synthetic single-object grasp dataset including 150 commodities of various
shapes, and a multi-object cluttered scene dataset including 100k point clouds
with robust, dense grasp poses and mask annotations. Experiments conducted on
Yumi IRB-1400 Robot demonstrate that the model trained on our dataset performs
well in real environments and outperforms previous methods by a large margin.

entire rail network in real-time, by estimating trains' delays relative to a
theoretical circulation plan. Existing implementations within railway companies
generally work using the approximation that a train's delay will stay constant
for the rest of its trip.
  Predicting the evolution of a given train's delay is a uniquely hard problem,
distinct from mainstream road traffic forecasting problems, since it involves
several hard-to-model phenomena: train spacing, station congestion and
heterogeneous rolling stock among others. We first offer empirical evidence of
the previously unexplored phenomenon of delay propagation in the French
National Railway Network, leading to delays being amplified by interactions
between trains. We then contribute a novel technique using the transformer
architecture and pre-trained embeddings to make real-time massively parallel
predictions for train delays at the scale of the whole rail network (over 3k
trains at peak hours, making predictions at an average horizon of 70 minutes).
Our approach yields very positive results on real-world data when compared to

of nonlinear dynamical models. Often a polynomial basis expansion is used to
describe the internal multivariate nonlinear mapping (P-NARX). Resorting to
fixed basis functions is convenient since it results in a closed form solution
of the estimation problem. The drawback, however, is that the predefined basis
does not necessarily lead to a sparse representation of the relationship,
typically resulting in very large numbers of parameters. So-called decoupling
techniques were specifically designed to reduce large multivariate functions.
It was found that, often, a more efficient parameterisation can be retrieved by
rotating towards a new basis. Characteristic to the decoupled structure is
that, expressed in the new basis, the relationship is structured such that only
single-input single-output nonlinear functions are required. Classical
decoupling techniques are unfit to deal with the case of single-output NARX
models. In this work, this limitation is overcome by adopting the filtered CPD
decoupling method of Decuyper et al. (2021b). The approach is illustrated on

methods efficiently solve certain nonlinear systems. The Asymptotic Numerical
Method (ANM) is a powerful continuation method that usually converges faster

a parameterized solution curve approximated with a high-order power series.
Although ANM has successfully solved a few graphics and engineering problems,
prior to our work, applying ANM to new problems required significant effort
because the standard ANM assumes quadratic functions, while manually deriving
the power series expansion for nonquadratic systems is a tedious and
challenging task.
  This paper presents a novel solver, SANM, that applies ANM to solve
symbolically represented nonlinear systems. SANM solves such systems in a fully
automated manner. SANM also extends ANM to support many nonquadratic operators,
including intricate ones such as singular value decomposition. Furthermore,
SANM generalizes ANM to support the implicit homotopy form. Moreover, SANM
achieves high computing performance via optimized system design and
implementation.
  We deploy SANM to solve forward and inverse elastic force equilibrium
problems and controlled mesh deformation problems with a few constitutive
models. Our results show that SANM converges faster than Newtonian solvers,
requires little programming effort for new problems, and delivers comparable or
better performance than a hand-coded, specialized ANM solver. While we
demonstrate on mesh deformation problems, SANM is generic and potentially

controlling hyperparameters in domains like evolutionary computation, AI
Planning or deep learning. Replicating these results, as well as studying new

benchmarking and thus research on DAC, we propose DACBench, a benchmark library
that seeks to collect and standardize existing DAC benchmarks from different AI
domains, as well as provide a template for new ones. For the design of
DACBench, we focused on important desiderata, such as (i) flexibility, (ii)
reproducibility, (iii) extensibility and (iv) automatic documentation and

DAC, we explore how a set of six initial benchmarks compare in several

the structure of the solutions is very complicated. For a fixed central energy
density up to three neutron star solutions can exist -- one general
relativistic and two scalarized, that is quite different from the scalarization

stability of these solutions using two independent approaches -- solving the
linearized radial perturbation equations and performing nonlinear simulations
in spherical symmetry. The results show that the change of stability occurs at
the maximum mass models and all solutions before that point are stable. This
leads to the interesting consequence that there exists a stable part of the
scalarized branch close to the bifurcation point where the mass of the star
increases with the decrease of the central energy density.

complexity of the problem has remained, until recently, one of the hardest open
questions in verification of concurrent systems. A first upper bound has been
provided only in 2015 by Leroux and Schmitz, then refined by the same authors
to non-primitive recursive Ackermannian upper bound in 2019. The exponential

over 40 years until a breakthrough non-elementary lower bound by

of collisions, an evolving protoplanetary disc and eccentricity/inclination
damping of planetary embryos. Initial conditions are constructed using two
different models for the core of the giant planet: a 'seed-model' and an
'equal-mass-model'. The former has a more massive protoplanet placed among
multiple small embryos in a compact configuration. The latter consists only of
equal-mass embryos. Simulations of the seed-model lead to the formation of
systems containing a hot Jupiter and super-Earths. The evolution consistently
follows four distinct phases: early giant impacts; runaway gas accretion onto
the seed protoplanet; disc damping-dominated evolution of the embryos orbiting
exterior to the giant; a late chaotic phase after dispersal of the gas disc.
Approximately 1% of the equal-mass simulations form a giant and follow the same
four-phase evolution. Synthetic transit observations of the equal-mass
simulations provide an occurrence rate of 0.26% for systems containing a hot
Jupiter and an inner super-Earth, similar to the 0.2% occurrence rate from
actual transit surveys, but simulated hot Jupiters are rarely detected as
single transiting planets, in disagreement with observations. A subset of our
simulations form two close-in giants, similar to the WASP-148 system. The

precise nature and strength of interactions as well as the manner in which the
full system is partitioned into subsystems. We also use the IBM quantum
computer to implement equivalent circuits that capture the dynamics of the
multipartite system in one of the NMR experiments. We compute and compare the

exercise shows that these indicators can estimate the degree of entanglement

that particles move on the geodesics associated with test particles. Rather,
for this to be the case one has to be able to derive such behavior starting
from the equations of motion that the particles obey, and to do so one can
employ the eikonal approximation. To see what kind of trajectories might occur
we explore the domain of support of the propagators associated with the wave
equations. For a minimally coupled massless scalar field the domain of support
in curved space is shown to not be restricted to the light cone, while for a
conformally coupled massless scalar field the curved space domain is only
restricted to the light cone if it propagates in a conformal to flat
background. Consequently, eikonalization does not in general lead to null
geodesics for curved space massless rays even though it does lead to straight
line trajectories in flat spacetime. Equal remarks apply to the massless
conformal invariant Maxwell equations. However, for massive particles one does
obtain standard geodesic behavior this way, since they do not propagate on the
light cone to begin with. Thus depending on how big the curvature actually is,
in principle, even if not necessarily in practice, the standard
null-geodesic-based gravitational bending formula and the general behavior of
propagating light rays are in need of modification in regions with high enough
curvature. We show that relativistic eikonalization has an intrinsic
light-front structure, and show that eikonalization in a theory with local
conformal symmetry leads to trajectories that are only globally conformally
symmetric. Normals to wavefronts follow the eikonal trajectories, with these
trajectories being the trajectories along which energy and momentum are
transported.

$q\bar{q}$ pairs, but nowadays there is mounting evidence for
`non-conventional' mesons, such as tetraquarks, glueballs, hybrids, and
molecules. The main aim of this thesis is to understand the nature of some
scalar and vector mesonic states which still remain puzzling. In this thesis we
investigate two nonets of $q\bar{q}$ excited vector mesons. Within an effective
QFT model we evaluate various decay channels of these states and compare the
results with experimental data from PDG. Moreover, we make predictions for a
not-yet observed $s\bar{s}$ state in $1$ $^3D_1$ nonet. Some non-conventional
mesons can be understood by the mechanism of dynamical generation. We show that
the inclusion of a single conventional $q\bar{q}$ seed in the relativistic QFT
Lagrangian may cause the appearance of an additional associated state as a
dynamically generated companion pole. Along this line, we show that light
scalar kaon $K^*_0(700)$ emerges as a companion pole of the $q\bar{q}$ meson
$K_0^*(1430)$. Moreover, we show that the enigmatic resonance $X(3872)$ in the
charmonium sector can be interpreted as the (virtual) companion pole of the
$c\bar{c}$ state $\chi_{c1}(2P)$. Then, we study the $c\bar{c}$ meson
$\psi(4040)$. We show that an additional companion pole appears on the complex
plane. At first sight one may identify it with the enhancement $Y(4008)$
observed by the Belle Collaboration. A detailed analysis reveals that different
mechanism is responsible for the creation of $Y(4008)$. Hence, the bump
associated with $Y(4008)$ should not be interpreted as an independent

scenarios, while CSW approach only demands the exclusivity structure of a
non-contextuality (NC) scenario. To deal with the extra structure related to
the presence of different players in a Bell scenario like CHSH, the
colored-graph approach was introduced. Does it make any difference to think
about CHSH as a Bell scenario or a more general NC scenario? The Bell CHSH
inequality is represented by a bicolored graph and the NC CHSH inequality by a
simple graph, which is the shadow of the colored graph. In general, we have
that the theta body of the colored graph is a subset of the theta body of its
shadow graph in the same way that the Lov\`asz number, which corresponds to the
quantum bound, of the simple graph is greater than or equal to the Lov\`asz
number of the colored graph. In the case of the CHSH inequality, we have that
the Lov\`asz numbers are equal. Does this accident also hold for the
corresponding quantum sets? Is it true that the theta bodies are equal, which
would mean that every correlation reached by quantum theory applied to the CHSH
NC scenario could also be obtained at the in principle more restrictive CHSH
Bell scenario? In this paper our answer to such a question is negativ. This
implies that there are quantum correlations which can not be obtained under
Bell restrictions.

Monte Carlo simulations to study the conformation, organization and dynamics of
two polymer chains confined to a single box-like cavity. The polymers are
modeled as flexible hard-sphere chains, and the box has a square cross-section
of side length $L$ and a height that is small enough to compress the polymers
in that dimension. For sufficiently large $L$, the system behaviour approaches
that of an isolated polymer in a slit. However, the combined effects of
crowding and confinement on the polymer organization, conformation and
equilibrium dynamics become significant when $L/R_{{\rm g},xy}^*\lesssim 5$,
where $R_{{\rm g},xy}^*$ is the transverse radius of gyration for a slit
geometry. In this regime, the centre-of-mass probability distribution in the
transverse plane exhibits a depletion zone near the centre of the cavity
(except at very small $L$) and a 4-fold symmetry with quasi-discrete positions.
Reduction in polymer size with decreasing $L$ arises principally from
confinement rather than inter-polymer crowding. By contrast, polymer diffusion
and internal motion are strongly affected by inter-polymer crowding. The two
polymers tend to occupy opposite positions relative to the box centre, about
which they diffuse relatively freely. Qualitatively, this static and dynamical
behaviour differs significantly from that previously observed for confinement
of two polymers to a narrow channel. The simulation results for a suitably
chosen box width are qualitatively consistent with results from a recent
experimental study of two $\lambda$-DNA chains confined to a nanofluidic
cavity.

identify sets of such incompatible pairs that can exchange donors, leading to
compatible transplants for each recipient. There is significant uncertainty
involved in this process, as planned transplants may be canceled for a plethora

planning exchanges. In this paper, we consider a robust variant of this problem
with recourse studied in the literature that takes into account vertex
failures, i.e., withdrawing donors and/or recipients. This problem belongs to
the class of defender-attacker-defender (DAD) models. We propose a cutting

embedding. Extant works have taken the neighborhood formation as the critical
information to reveal the inherent dynamics of network structures, and
suggested encoding temporal edge formation sequences to capture the historical
influences of neighbors. In this paper, however, we argue that the edge
formation can be attributed to a variety of driving factors including the
temporal influence, which is better referred to as multiple aspects. As a
matter of fact, different node aspects can drive the formation of distinctive
neighbors, giving birth to the multi-aspect embedding that relates to but goes
beyond a temporal scope. Along this vein, we propose a Mixture of Hawkes-based
Temporal Network Embeddings (MHNE) model to capture the aspect-driven
neighborhood formation of networks. In MHNE, we encode the multi-aspect
embeddings into the mixture of Hawkes processes to gain the advantages in
modeling the excitation effects and the latent aspects. Specifically, a graph
attention mechanism is used to assign different weights to account for the
excitation effects of history events, while a Gumbel-Softmax is plugged in to
derive the distribution over the aspects. Extensive experiments on 8 different
temporal networks have demonstrated the great performance of the multi-aspect

promising, we observed two problems in generated captions: 1) content
inconsistency where models would generate contradicting facts; 2) not
informative enough where models would miss parts of important information. From
a causal perspective, the reason is that models have captured spurious
statistical correlations between visual features and certain expressions (e.g.,
visual features of ""long hair"" and ""woman""). In this paper, we propose a
dependent multi-task learning framework with the causal intervention (DMTCI).
Firstly, we involve an intermediate task, bag-of-categories generation, before
the final task, image captioning. The intermediate task would help the model
better understand the visual features and thus alleviate the content
inconsistency problem. Secondly, we apply Pearl's do-calculus on the model,
cutting off the link between the visual features and possible confounders and
thus letting models focus on the causal visual features. Specifically, the
high-frequency concept set is considered as the proxy confounders where the
real confounders are inferred in the continuous space. Finally, we use a
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enable end-to-end
training and reduce the inter-task error accumulations. The extensive

systems where they have proven to be highly effective. The application to
systems with larger on-site dimension, such as spin-1 or bosonic systems, has
been explored less and predominantly using spin-1/2 Restricted Boltzmann
Machines (RBMs) with a one-hot/unary encoding. Here we propose a more direct
generalisation of RBMs for spin-1 that retains the key properties of the
standard spin-1/2 RBM, specifically trivial product states representations,
labelling freedom for the visible variables and gauge equivalence to the tensor
network formulation. To test this new approach we present variational Monte
Carlo (VMC) calculations for the spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg (AFH)
model and benchmark it against the one-hot/unary encoded RBM demonstrating that
it achieves the same accuracy with substantially fewer variational parameters.
Further to this we investigate how the hidden unit complexity of NQS depend on
the local single-spin basis used. Exploiting the tensor network version of our
RBM we construct an analytic NQS representation of the
Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state in the $xyz$ spin-1 basis using only
$M = 2N$ hidden units, compared to $M \sim O(N^2)$ required in the $S^z$ basis.
Additional VMC calculations provide strong evidence that the AKLT state in fact
possesses an exact compact NQS representation in the $xyz$ basis with only
$M=N$ hidden units. These insights help to further unravel how to most
effectively adapt the NQS framework for more complex quantum systems.

notion of defect, a numerical datum associated to each of the simple modules

Iwahori-Hecke algebras of finite Coxeter groups in the equal parameter case,
and speculated that a similar result should hold in the unequal parameter case.
We conjecture that the defect is a block invariant for all cyclotomic Hecke

Contrastive Model Inversion~(CMI), where the data diversity is explicitly

main observation is that, under the constraint of the same amount of data,
higher data diversity usually indicates stronger instance discrimination. To
this end, we introduce in CMI a contrastive learning objective that encourages
the synthesizing instances to be distinguishable from the already synthesized
ones in previous batches. Experiments of pre-trained models on CIFAR-10,

explain additive compositionality, but the following questions remain
unanswered: (Q1) The assumptions of those theories do not hold for the

as an AND operation of word meanings, but it is not well understood how other

paper proposes a post-processing method for bridging the gap between practical
word embedding and the assumption of theory about additive compositionality as

more effective and efficient access control (AC) approaches. Recently,
Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) approaches have been shown to be
promising in fulfilling the AC needs of such emerging complex computing
environments. An ABAC model grants access to a requester based on attributes of
entities in a system and an authorization policy; however, its generality and
flexibility come with a higher cost. Further, increasing complexities of
organizational systems and the need for federated accesses to their resources
make the task of AC enforcement and management much more challenging. In this
paper, we propose an adaptive ABAC policy learning approach to automate the
authorization management task. We model ABAC policy learning as a reinforcement
learning problem. In particular, we propose a contextual bandit system, in
which an authorization engine adapts an ABAC model through a feedback control
loop; it relies on interacting with users/administrators of the system to
receive their feedback that assists the model in making authorization
decisions. We propose four methods for initializing the learning model and a
planning approach based on attribute value hierarchy to accelerate the learning
process. We focus on developing an adaptive ABAC policy learning model for a
home IoT environment as a running example. We evaluate our proposed approach
over real and synthetic data. We consider both complete and sparse datasets in
our evaluations. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach
achieves performance that is comparable to ones based on supervised learning in

networks based on WDM technologies forming the core part of Internet

Thanks to the convergence of significant advances in optical transmission
technologies, and photonic switching, transparent (all-optical) architecture
has come into practice, paving the way for eliminating the over-utilization of
costly optical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) interfaces and hence, yielding
remarkable savings of cost and energy consumption compared to opaque
architecture. Traditional designs for transparent optical networks based on
single-objective optimization model aiming at optimizing solely a single
performance metric appears to be insufficient to capture the nuances of
practical designs while conventional multi-objective approach tends to reach
(non-) optimal solutions. Different from existing works, we present a new
framework for multi-objective WDM network designs capturing several goals on
one hand and on the other hand, achieving optimal solutions. Moreover, our
proposal exploits the characteristics of each constituent objectives to lay the
foundation for setting up weight coefficient so that the order of optimization
is guaranteed. Equally important, our proposal is pragmatic in the sense that
the complexity of the optimization model remains the same as the
single-objective model while the quality of solution has been greatly improved.
We have extensively tested realistic optical core networks topologies, that is,
COST239 and NSFNET, with various network traffic conditions and it turns out
that our design brings about a saving of wavelength link usage up to roughly
$28\%$ in the most favorable cases while $14\%$ is expected for the least
favorable cases.

exploit the OPE expansion of composite twist fields, to provide very general
results when the subsystem is much smaller than the total system. We focus on
the massless compact boson and our results are tested against exact numerical

results show that our Word Order Vector (WOVe) word embeddings approach
outperforms unmodified GloVe on the natural lan-guage tasks of analogy

modeling capabilities of the algebraic modeling language Pyomo to robust
optimization problems. ROmodel helps practitioners transition from
deterministic to robust optimization through modeling objects which allow
formulating robust models in close analogy to their mathematical formulation.
ROmodel contains a library of commonly used uncertainty sets which can be
generated using their matrix representations, but it also allows users to
define custom uncertainty sets using Pyomo constraints. ROmodel supports
adjustable variables via linear decision rules. The resulting models can be
solved using ROmodels solvers which implement both the robust reformulation and
cutting plane approach. ROmodel is a platform to implement and compare custom
uncertainty sets and reformulations. We demonstrate ROmodel's capabilities by
applying it to six case studies. We implement custom uncertainty sets based on
(warped) Gaussian processes to show how ROmodel can integrate data-driven
models with optimization.

origin of the sustained non-thermal emission is likely. This requires
distributed acceleration of electrons up to near PeV energies along the jet.
The underlying acceleration mechanism is still unclear. Shear acceleration is a
promising candidate, as velocity-shear stratification is a natural consequence
of the collimated flow of a jet. We study the details of shear acceleration by
solving the steady-state Fokker-Planck-type equation and provide a simple
general solution for trans-relativistic jets for a range of magnetohydrodynamic
turbulent power-law spectra. In general, the accelerated particle population is
a power-law spectrum with an exponential-like cut-off, where the power-law
index is determined by the turbulence spectrum and the balance of escape and
acceleration of particles. Adopting a simple linearly decreasing velocity
profile in the boundary of large-scale jets, we find that the multi-wavelength
spectral energy distribution of X-ray jets, such as Centaurus A and 3C 273, can
be reproduced with electrons that are accelerated up to $\sim$ PeV. In
kpc-scale jets, protons may be accelerated up to $\sim$ EeV, supporting the
hypothesis that large-scale jets are strong candidates for
ultra-high-energy-cosmic-ray sources within the framework of shear

learning architecture toward collaborative target tracking at scale, with
decentralized communications. Particularly, our learning architecture leverages
a graph neural network (GNN) to capture local interactions of the robots and
learns decentralized decision-making for the robots. We train the learning
model by imitating an expert solution and implement the resulting model for
decentralized action selection involving local observations and communications
only. We demonstrate the performance of our GNN-based learning approach in a
scenario of active target tracking with large networks of robots. The
simulation results show our approach nearly matches the tracking performance of
the expert algorithm, and yet runs several orders faster with up to 100 robots.
Moreover, it slightly outperforms a decentralized greedy algorithm but runs
faster (especially with more than 20 robots). The results also exhibit our
approach's generalization capability in previously unseen scenarios, e.g.,
larger environments and larger networks of robots.

introduce and study two natural extensions in the setting of graded modules

resolutions. A minimal free resolution of an OI-module can be characterized by
the fact that the free module in every fixed homological degree, say $i$, has
minimal rank among all free resolutions of the module. We show that any
finitely generated graded module over a noetherian polynomial OI-algebra admits
a graded minimal free resolution, and that it is unique. A width-wise minimal
free resolution is a free resolution that provides a minimal free resolution of
a module in every width. Such a resolution is necessarily minimal. Its
existence is not guaranteed. However, we show that certain monomial OI-ideals
do admit width-wise minimal free or, more generally, width-wise minimal flat
resolutions. These ideals include families of well-known monomial ideals such
as Ferrers ideals and squarefree strongly stable ideals. The arguments rely on

statistical treatments of functional and curve shape data. However, this usage
has suffered from an important restriction: the function boundaries are assumed
fixed and matched. Functional data exhibiting unmatched boundaries typically
arise from dynamical systems with variable evolution rates such as COVID-19
infection rate curves associated with different geographical regions. In this
case, it is more natural to model such data with sliding boundaries and use
partial matching, i.e., only a part of a function is matched to another
function. Here, we develop a comprehensive Riemannian framework that allows for
partial matching, comparing, and clustering of functions under both phase
variability and uncertain boundaries. We extend past work by: (1) Forming a
joint action of the time-warping and time-scaling groups; (2) Introducing a
metric that is invariant to this joint action, allowing for a gradient-based
approach to elastic partial matching; and (3) Presenting a modification that,
while losing the metric property, allows one to control relative influence of
the two groups. This framework is illustrated for registering and clustering

easily be compromised by the misallocation of recorded events to their
originating sources. Even with a small number of sources, that nonetheless have
overlapping point spread functions, the allocation of events to sources is a
complex task that is subject to uncertainty. We develop a Bayesian method
designed to sift high-energy photon events from multiple sources with
overlapping point spread functions, leveraging the differences in their
spatial, spectral, and temporal signatures. The method probabilistically
assigns each event to a given source. Such a disentanglement allows more
detailed spectral or temporal analysis to focus on the individual component in
isolation, free of contamination from other sources or the background. We are
also able to compute source parameters of interest like their locations,
relative brightness, and background contamination, while accounting for the
uncertainty in event assignments. Simulation studies that include event arrival
time information demonstrate that the temporal component improves event
disambiguation beyond using only spatial and spectral information. The proposed
methods correctly allocate up to 65% more events than the corresponding
algorithms that ignore event arrival time information. We apply our methods to
two stellar X-ray binaries, UV Cet and HBC515 A, observed with Chandra. We
demonstrate that our methods are capable of removing the contamination due to a
strong flare on UV Cet B in its companion approximately 40 times weaker during

$\widetilde{\tau}$, is one of the most interesting channels to search for SUSY
in. First of all, the $\widetilde{\tau}$ is likely to be the lightest of the
scalar leptons. Secondly the signature of $\widetilde{\tau}$ pair production
signal events is one of the experimentally most difficult ones, thereby
constituting the ""worst"" possible scenario for SUSY searches. The current
model-independent $\widetilde{\tau}$ limits comes from analyses performed at
LEP but they suffer from the limited energy of this facility. Limits obtained
at the LHC do extend to higher masses, but they are only valid under strong
assumptions. ILC, a future electron-positron collider with energy up to 500 GeV
and upgrade capability\footnote{The initial ILC energy is planned to be 250
GeV.}, is a promising facility for SUSY searches. The capability of the ILC for
determining exclusion/discovery limits for the $\widetilde{\tau}$ in a
model-independent way is shown in this paper, together with an overview of the
current state-of-the-art. Results of the last studies of $\widetilde{\tau}$
pair-production at the ILC are presented, showing the improvements with respect
to previous results.

represent realistic inputs in the modeled domains. Diverse domains such as

features that an adversary must satisfy for an attack to be realized (in
addition to any adversary-specific goals). In this paper, we explore how domain
constraints limit adversarial capabilities and how adversaries can adapt their
strategies to create realistic (constraint-compliant) examples. In this, we
develop techniques to learn domain constraints from data, and show how the
learned constraints can be integrated into the adversarial crafting process. We
evaluate the efficacy of our approach in network intrusion and phishing
datasets and find: (1) up to 82% of adversarial examples produced by
state-of-the-art crafting algorithms violate domain constraints, (2) domain
constraints are robust to adversarial examples; enforcing constraints yields an
increase in model accuracy by up to 34%. We observe not only that adversaries
must alter inputs to satisfy domain constraints, but that these constraints
make the generation of valid adversarial examples far more challenging.

differ in principle from other input settings. It is important to attribute the
decision to input features and other related instances connected by the graph

do not enforce explanations to be valid, sparse, or robust to input

that an explanation method for graph neural networks should follow and
introduce a metric RDT-Fidelity as a measure of the explanation's

  Conference on Information Systems (ECIS2020), Marrakesh, Morocco",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In recent years the literature has put a greater emphasis on theory building
in the context of Enterprise Architecture, EA, research. Specifically, scholars
tend to focus on EA-based capabilities that organize and deploy
organization-specific resources to align strategic objectives with the
particular use of technology. Despite the growth in EA studies, substantial
gaps remain in the literature. The most noteworthy gaps are that the
conceptualization of EA-based capabilities still lacks a firm base in theory
and that there is no conclusive evidence on how EA-based capabilities drive
business transformation and deliver benefits to the firm. Therefore, this study
focuses on EA-based capabilities, using the dynamic capabilities view as a
theoretical foundation, develops and tests a new research model that explains
how dynamic enterprise architecture capabilities lead to organizational
benefits. Hypotheses associated with the research model are tested using a
dataset that contains responses from 299 CIOs, IT managers, and lead
architects. Results show that dynamic enterprise architecture capabilities
positively influence the firm's process innovation and business/IT alignment.
These mediating forces are both positively associated with organizational
benefits. This study advances our understanding of how to efficaciously
de-lineate dynamic enterprise architecture capabilities in delivering benefits
to the organization.

generating random linear programming problems of large dimension $n$ on cluster
computing systems. To ensure the consistency of the problem and the boundedness
of the feasible region, the constraint system includes $2n+1$ standard
inequalities, called support inequalities. New random inequalities are
generated and added to the system in a manner that ensures the consistency of
the constraints. Furthermore, the algorithm uses two likeness metrics to
prevent the addition of a new random inequality that is similar to one already
present in the constraint system. The algorithm also rejects random
inequalities that cannot affect the solution of the linear programming problem
bounded by the support inequalities. The parallel implementation of the
FRaGenLP algorithm is performed in C++ through the parallel BSF-skeleton, which
encapsulates all aspects related to the MPI-based parallelization of the
program. We provide the results of large-scale computational experiments on a
cluster computing system to study the scalability of the FRaGenLP algorithm.

Error Correction Models (UECMs) to estimate the relationship between income and
CO2 emissions per capita in 21 Latin American Countries (LACs) over 1960-2017.
Using time series we estimate six different specifications of the model to take
into account the independent effect on CO2 emissions per capita of different
factors considered as drivers of different dynamics of CO2 emissions along the
development path. This approach allows to address two concerns. First, the
estimation of the model controlling for different variables serves to assess if
the EKC hypothesis is supported by evidence in any of the LACs considered and
to evaluate if this evidence is robust to different model specifications.
Second, the inclusion of control variables accounting for the effect on CO2
emissions is directed at increasing our understanding of CO2 emissions drivers
in different countries. The EKC hypothesis effectively describes the long term
income-emissions relationship only in a minority of LACs and, in many cases,
the effect on CO2 emissions of different factors depends on the individual
country experience and on the type and quantity of environmental policies
adopted. Overall, these results call for increased environmental action in the
region.

adapters to investigate the performance of multiple adapters for
parameter-efficient cross-lingual speech adaptation. Based on our previous
MetaAdapter that implicitly leverages adapters, we propose a novel algorithms
called SimAdapter for explicitly learning knowledge from adapters. Our
algorithm leverages adapters which can be easily integrated into the
Transformer structure.MetaAdapter leverages meta-learning to transfer the
general knowledge from training data to the test language. SimAdapter aims to
learn the similarities between the source and target languages during
fine-tuning using the adapters. We conduct extensive experiments on
five-low-resource languages in Common Voice dataset. Results demonstrate that
our MetaAdapter and SimAdapter methods can reduce WER by 2.98% and 2.55% with
only 2.5% and 15.5% of trainable parameters compared to the strong full-model
fine-tuning baseline. Moreover, we also show that these two novel algorithms
can be integrated for better performance with up to 3.55% relative WER

synchrotron radiation that trace shock waves induced by galaxy cluster mergers.
The particle (re-)acceleration mechanism producing such radio relics is
unclear. One major open question is whether relics can be formed directly from
a population of thermal seed electrons, or if pre-existing relativistic seed
electrons are required. In some cases AGN can provide such a population of
sub-GeV electrons. However, it is unclear how common this connection is. In
this paper we present LOFAR 140 MHz and VLA L-band radio observations, as well
as Chandra data of PSZ2 G096.88+24.18, a merging galaxy cluster system hosting
a pair of radio relics. A large patch of diffuse emission connects a bright
radio galaxy with one of the relics, likely affecting the properties of the
relic. We find that the most plausible explanation for the connection is that
the merger shock wave has passed over an AGN lobe. The shock passing over this
seed population of electrons has led to an increased brightness in the relic
only in the region filled with seed electrons.

  'minted' package behavior, so some atoms may look a little off",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When working to understand usage of a data format, examples of the data
format are often more representative than the format's specification. For
example, two different applications might use very different JSON
representations, or two PDF-writing applications might make use of very
different areas of the PDF specification to realize the same rendered content.
The complexity arising from these distinct origins can lead to large,
difficult-to-understand attack surfaces, presenting a security concern when
considering both exfiltration and data schizophrenia. Grammar inference can aid
in describing the practical language generator behind examples of a data
format. However, most grammar inference research focuses on natural language,
not data formats, and fails to support crucial features such as type recursion.
We propose a novel set of mechanisms for grammar inference, RL-GRIT, and apply
them to understanding de facto data formats. After reviewing existing grammar
inference solutions, it was determined that a new, more flexible scaffold could
be found in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Within this work, we lay out the many
algorithmic changes required to adapt RL from its traditional, sequential-time
environment to the highly interdependent environment of parsing. The result is
an algorithm which can demonstrably learn recursive control structures in
simple data formats, and can extract meaningful structure from fragments of the
PDF format. Whereas prior work in grammar inference focused on either regular
languages or constituency parsing, we show that RL can be used to surpass the
expressiveness of both classes, and offers a clear path to learning
context-sensitive languages. The proposed algorithm can serve as a building
block for understanding the ecosystems of de facto data formats.

subject to a user-defined level of fairness. We enforce fairness as a model
selection step in which we choose the value of a ridge penalty to control the
effect of sensitive attributes. We then estimate the parameters of the model
conditional on the chosen penalty value. Our proposal is mathematically simple,
with a solution that is partly in closed form, and produces estimates of the
regression coefficients that are intuitive to interpret as a function of the
level of fairness. Furthermore, it is easily extended to generalised linear
models, kernelised regression models and other penalties; and it can
accommodate multiple definitions of fairness.
  We compare our approach with the regression model from Komiyama et al.
(2018), which implements a provably-optimal linear regression model; and with
the fair models from Zafar et al. (2019). We evaluate these approaches
empirically on six different data sets, and we find that our proposal provides
better goodness of fit and better predictive accuracy for the same level of
fairness. In addition, we highlight a source of bias in the original
experimental evaluation in Komiyama et al. (2018).

The anatomical-physiological and experimental evidences are reviewed. It is
demonstrated that the stabilization of the soliton is guaranteed by the
coupling between muscle vibration and cell activation. Therefore the

the meridian. The meridian wave equations and its solution are deduced and how
these results can be used in studying human healthy is briefly discussed .
