identified: Firstly, medical data is naturally distributed across multiple
local sites, making it difficult to collectively train machine learning models
without data leakage. Secondly, in medical applications, data are often
collected from different sources and views, resulting in heterogeneity and
complexity that requires reconciliation. This paper aims to provide a generic
Federated Multi-View Learning (FedMV) framework for multi-view data leakage
prevention, which is based on different types of local data availability and
enables to accommodate two types of problems: Vertical Federated Multi-View
Learning (V-FedMV) and Horizontal Federated Multi-View Learning (H-FedMV). We
experimented with real-world keyboard data collected from BiAffect study. The
results demonstrated that the proposed FedMV approach can make full use of
multi-view data in a privacy-preserving way, and both V-FedMV and H-FedMV
methods perform better than their single-view and pairwise counterparts.
Besides, the proposed model can be easily adapted to deal with multi-view
sequential data in a federated environment, which has been modeled and
experimentally studied. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the
first to consider both vertical and horizontal diversification in the
multi-view setting, as well as their sequential federated learning.

a function of the local surface neighborhood; yet, point clouds do not disclose
the full underlying surface structure. Even assuming known geodesic proximity,
calculating a consistent normal orientation requires the global context. In
this work, we introduce a novel approach for establishing a globally consistent
normal orientation for point clouds. Our solution separates the local and
global components into two different sub-problems. In the local phase, we train
a neural network to learn a coherent normal direction per patch (i.e.,
consistently oriented normals within a single patch). In the global phase, we
propagate the orientation across all coherent patches using a dipole
propagation. Our dipole propagation decides to orient each patch using the
electric field defined by all previously orientated patches. This gives rise to
a global propagation that is stable, as well as being robust to nearby
surfaces, holes, sharp features and noise.

(UAVs) operating in unknown environments. Often, these missions start with
building a map for the environment via pure exploration and subsequently using
(i.e. exploiting) the generated map for downstream navigation tasks.
Accomplishing these navigation tasks in two separate steps is not always
possible or even disadvantageous for UAVs deployed in outdoor and dynamically
changing environments. Current exploration approaches either use a priori
human-generated maps or use heuristics such as frontier-based exploration.
Other approaches use learning but focus only on learning policies for specific
tasks by either using sample inefficient random exploration or by making
impractical assumptions about full map availability. In this paper, we develop
an adaptive exploration approach to trade off between exploration and
exploitation in one single step for UAVs searching for areas of interest (AoIs)
in unknown environments using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The proposed
approach uses a map segmentation technique to decompose the environment map
into smaller, tractable maps. Then, a simple information gain function is
repeatedly computed to determine the best target region to search during each
iteration of the process. DDQN and A2C algorithms are extended with a stack of
LSTM layers and trained to generate optimal policies for the exploration and
exploitation, respectively. We tested our approach in 3 different tasks against
4 baselines. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of
navigating through randomly generated environments and covering more AoI in
less time steps compared to the baselines.

single-task approach for future surveys and will allow us to detect departures
from the standard model with higher significance. By contrast, the limited
sensitivity of current data severely hinders the use of agnostic methods, since
the Gaussian processes parameters need to be fine tuned in order to obtain
robust reconstructions.

to their large compactnesses and strong gravitational fields. For example,
binary pulsar and gravitational wave observations have placed stringent bounds
on certain scalar-tensor theories in which a massless scalar field is coupled
to the metric through matter. A remarkable phenomenon of neutron stars in such
scalar-tensor theories is spontaneous scalarization, where a normalized scalar
charge remains order unity even if the matter-scalar coupling vanishes
asymptotically far from the neutron star. While most works on scalarization of
neutron stars focus on numerical analysis, this paper aims to derive accurate
scalar charges analytically. To achieve this, we consider a simple energy
density profile of the Tolman VII form and work in a weak-field expansion. We
solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations order by order and
apply Pad\'e resummation to account for higher-order effects. We find that our
analytic scalar charges in terms of the stellar compactness beautifully model
those computed numerically. We also find a quasi-universal relation between the
scalar charge and stellar binding energy that is insensitive to the underlying
equations of state. Comparison of analytic scalar charges for Tolman VII and
constant density stars mathematically support this quasi-universal relation.
The analytic results found here provide physically motivated, ready-to-use
accurate expressions for scalar charges.

of the fractional matching algorithms of Bhattacharya et al. [STOC'16],
Bernstein et al. [FOCS'20], and Bhattacharya and Kulkarni [SODA'19].
  Prior to our work, there were two known general-purpose rounding schemes for
dynamic fractional matchings. Both these schemes, by Arar et al. [ICALP'18] and
Wajc [STOC'20], were randomized.
  Our rounding scheme works by maintaining a good {\em matching-sparsifier}
with bounded arboricity, and then applying the algorithm of Peleg and Solomon
[SODA'16] to maintain a near-optimal matching in this low arboricity graph. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first dynamic matching algorithm that
works on general graphs by using an algorithm for low-arboricity graphs as a
black-box subroutine. This feature of our rounding scheme might be of
independent interest.

partly due to a scarcity in emotionally annotated data and the varied
modalities which express user engagement online. In this contribution, we
utilise a large dataset of YouTube review videos which includes ca. 600 hours
of dimensional arousal, valence and trustworthiness annotations. We investigate
features extracted from these signals against various user engagement
indicators including views, like/dislike ratio, as well as the sentiment of
comments. In doing so, we identify the positive and negative influences which
single features have, as well as interpretable patterns in each dimension which
relate to user engagement. Our results demonstrate that smaller boundary ranges
and fluctuations for arousal lead to an increase in user engagement.
Furthermore, the extracted time-series features reveal significant (p<0.05)
correlations for each dimension, such as, count below signal mean (arousal),
number of peaks (valence), and absolute energy (trustworthiness). From this, an
effective combination of features is outlined for approaches aiming to
automatically predict several user engagement indicators. In a user engagement
prediction paradigm we compare all features against semi-automatic

selected feature sets appear to outperform the usage of all features, e.g.,

possibly verify entanglement across all $N$ qubits participating in the

we establish an upper bound to the expectation values in fully separable states
by proving a generalization of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which may serve
of independent interest. We demonstrate that a subset of such observables can
serve as entanglement witnesses for QAOA-MaxCut states, and further argue that
they are especially well tailored for this purpose by defining and computing an
entanglement potency metric on witnesses. A subset of these observables also
certify, in a weaker sense, the entanglement in GHZ states, which share the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of QAOA-MaxCut. The construction of such witnesses
follows directly from the cost Hamiltonian to be optimized, and not through the
standard technique of using the projector of the state being certified. It may
thus provide insights to construct similar witnesses for other variational

schedule generation mechanisms for TSN have a constraining assumption that both
switches and end-systems in the network must have at least the TSN capabilities
related to scheduled gates and time synchronization. However, many TSN networks
use off-the-shelf end-systems, e.g., for providing sensor data, which are not

  In this paper, we propose a more flexible scheduling strategy that considers
a worst-case delay analysis within the scheduling synthesis step, leveraging
the solution's optimality to support TSN networks with unscheduled and

membrane technologies, necessitating chemical dosing of the feedwater to adjust
its pH. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging membraneless technique for
water treatment and desalination, based on electrosorption of salt ions into
charging microporous electrodes. CDI cells show strong internally-generated pH
variations during operation, and thus CDI can potentially remove amphoteric

inhibited by the complexities inherent to coupling of pH dynamics and
amphoteric ion properties in a charging CDI cell. Here, we present a novel

that important design rules for such systems are highly counter-intuitive. For
example, we show both theoretically and experimentally that for boron removal
the anode should be placed upstream, which runs counter to accepted wisdom in

learning to predict these pseudo-labels with an appearance model. Moreover, we
introduce a multi-clip loss as a simple yet efficient way to improve the

also take into consideration the temporal granularity of videos during
self-training of the appearance model, which was missed in previous works. As a
result we obtain a strong motion-augmented representation model suited for

problems? In this work, we address this question by comparing sparse agents who
have to address the non-stationarity of the exploration-exploitation problem
with supervised agents trained to imitate an expert. We show that feed-forward
networks trained with behavioural cloning compared to reinforcement learning
can be pruned to higher levels of sparsity without performance degradation.
This suggests that in order to solve the RL-specific distributional shift
agents require more degrees of freedom. Using a set of carefully designed
baseline conditions, we find that the majority of the lottery ticket effect in
both learning paradigms can be attributed to the identified mask rather than
the weight initialization. The input layer mask selectively prunes entire input
dimensions that turn out to be irrelevant for the task at hand. At a moderate
level of sparsity the mask identified by iterative magnitude pruning yields
minimal task-relevant representations, i.e., an interpretable inductive bias.
Finally, we propose a simple initialization rescaling which promotes the robust
identification of sparse task representations in low-dimensional control tasks.

post-processing of existing magneto-hydrodynamic simulations, relying on
computing the evolution of chemistry over the dynamic history of a subset of
particles from within the raw simulation. Here, we validate such a technique,
assessing its ability to recover the abundances of chemical species, using the
chemistry package KROME. We also assess, for the first time, the importance of
the main free input parameters, by means of a direct comparison with a
self-consistent state-of-the-art simulation in which chemistry was directly
coupled to hydrodynamics. We have found that the post-processing is highly
reliable, with an accuracy at the percent level, even when the most relaxed
input parameters are employed. In particular, our results show that the number
of particles used does not affect significantly the average properties,
although it suppresses the appearance of possibly important spatial features.
On the other hand, the choice of the integration time-step plays a crucial
role. Longer integration time-steps can produce large errors, as the
post-processing solution will be forced towards chemical equilibrium, a
condition that does not always necessarily apply. When the interpolation-based
reconstruction of chemical properties is performed, the errors further increase
up to a factor of $\sim2$. Concluding, our results suggest that this technique
is extremely useful when exploring the relative quantitative effect of
different chemical parameters and/or networks, without the need of re-running

the specific properties of the TCI that were demonstrated previously via fully

is the most unambiguous signature of the neutral to ionized transition of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) taking place during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR).
Recent studies, e.g. Kulkarni et al. (2019a) and Keating et al. (2019), showed
that reproducing the observed Lyman-alpha opacities after overlap required a
non-monotonous evolution of cosmic emissivity: rising, peaking at z=6, and then
decreasing onwards to z=4. Such an evolution is puzzling considering galaxy
build-up and the cosmic star formation rate are still continously on the rise
at these epochs. Here, we use new RAMSES-CUDATON simulations to show that such
a peaked evolution may occur naturally in a fully coupled
radiation-hydrodynamical framework. In our fiducial run, cosmic emissivity at
z>6 is dominated by a low mass (M$_{\rm DM}<2.10^9$ M$_{\odot}$), high escape
fraction halo population, driving reionization, up to overlap. Approaching z=6,
this population is radiatively suppressed due to the rising ionizing UV
background, and its emissivity drops. In the meantime, the high mass halo
population builds up and its emissivity rises, but not fast enough to
compensate the dimming of the low mass haloes, because of low escape fractions.
The combined ionizing emissivity of these two populations therefore naturally
results in a rise and fall of the cosmic emissivity, from z=12 to z=4, with a
peak at z=6. An alternative run, which features higher escape fractions for the
high mass haloes and later suppression at low mass, leads to overshooting the
ionizing rate, over-ionizing the IGM and therefore too low Lyman-alpha
opacities.

reservoirs. These should converge to the correct continuum limit, albeit with a
trade-off between discretization and computational cost. Here, we study this
interplay for extended reservoir simulations, where relaxation maintains a bias
or temperature drop across the system. Our analysis begins in the
non-interacting limit, where we parameterize different discretizations to
compare them on an even footing. For many-body systems, we develop a method to
estimate the relaxation that best approximates the continuum by controlling
virtual transitions in Kramers' turnover for the current. While some
discretizations are more efficient for calculating currents, there is little
benefit with regard to the overall state of the system. Any gains become
marginal for many-body, tensor network simulations, where the relative
performance of discretizations varies when sweeping other numerical controls.
These results indicate that a given reservoir discretization may have little
impact on numerical efficiency for certain computational tools. The choice of a
relaxation parameter, however, is crucial, and the method we develop provides a
reliable estimate of the optimal relaxation for finite reservoirs.

distribution from $q=1$ down to $q\sim0.3$ than either binary stars or dense
stellar clusters, similar to the population properties inferred from the most
recent catalog of gravitational-wave events, though we do not claim that all
the observed events can be accounted for with triples. While hierarchical
mergers in clusters can also produce asymmetric mass ratios, the unique spins
of such mergers can be used to distinguished them from those produced from
stellar triples. All three channels occupy distinct regions in total mass-mass
ratio space, which may allow them to be disentangled as more BH mergers are
detected by LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.

data via both multiplicative and additive biases through the receiver's gain
and noise temperature. While experiments attempt to remove these biases, the
residuals of their imperfect calibration techniques can still confuse signal
extraction algorithms. In this paper, the fourth and final installment of our
pipeline series, we present a technique for fitting out receiver effects as
efficiently as possible. The fact that the gain and global signal, which are
multiplied in the observation equation, must both be modeled implies that the
model of the data is nonlinear in its parameters, making numerical sampling the
only way to explore the parameter distribution rigorously. However,
multi-spectra fits, which are necessary to extract the signal confidently as
demonstrated in the third paper of the series, often require large numbers of
foreground parameters, increasing the dimension of the posterior distribution
that must be explored and therefore causing numerical sampling inefficiencies.
Building upon techniques in the second paper of the series, we outline a method
to explore the full parameter distribution by numerically sampling a small
subset of the parameters and analytically marginalizing over the others. We
test this method in simulation using a type-I Chebyshev band-pass filter gain
model and a fast signal model based on a spline between local extrema. The
method works efficiently, converging quickly to the posterior signal parameter
distribution. The final signal uncertainties are of the same order as the noise
in the data.

The transverse positions cover G1's minor and major axes at impact parameters

kinematic connection between the cool-warm enriched CGM (traced by MgII) and
the interstellar medium (traced by [OII]). This provides strong evidence for
the existence of an extended disc that co-rotates with the galaxy out to tens
of kiloparsecs. The MgII velocity dispersion ($\sigma \approx 30-100$ km
s$^{-1}$, depending on position) is of the same order as the modeled galaxy
rotational velocity ($v_{\rm rot} \approx 80$ km s$^{-1}$), providing evidence
for the presence of a turbulent and pressure-supported CGM component. We regard
the absorption to be modulated by a galactic-scale outflow, as it offers a
natural scenario for the observed line-of-sight dispersion and asymmetric
profiles observed against both the arcs and the galaxy. An extended enriched
co-rotating disc together with the signatures of a galactic outflow, are
telltale signs of metal recycling in the $z\sim 1$ CGM.

metal-poor Galactic GCs, we find that the upper red giant branch (RGB) of EXT8

we place an upper limit of sigma(F606W-F814W)=0.015 mag on any intrinsic colour
spread. The corresponding metallicity spread can be up to sigma([Fe/H])=0.2 dex

(HB) is located mostly on the blue side of the instability strip and has a tail
extending to at least M(F606W)=+3, as in the Galactic GC M15. We identify two
candidate RR Lyrae variables and several UV-luminous post-HB/post AGB star

high resolution images of distant galaxies to date. Our goal is to investigate
how the structure, as opposed to size, surface brightness, or mass, changes
with time. In particular, we investigate how the concentration and asymmetry of
light evolve in the rest-frame optical. To interpret our galaxy structure
measurements, we also run and analyse 300 simulation realisations from
IllustrisTNG to determine the timescale of mergers for the CAS system. We
measure that from $z=0-3$, the median asymmetry merger timescale is
$0.56^{+0.23}_{-0.18}$Gyr, and find it does not vary with redshift. Using this
data, we find that galaxies become progressively asymmetric at a given mass at
higher redshifts and we derive merger rates which scale as
$\sim(1+z)^{1.87\pm0.04}$Gyr$^{-1}$, which agrees well with recent machine
learning and galaxy pair approaches, removing previous inconsistencies. We also
show that far-infrared selected galaxies that are invisible to \textit{HST}
have a negligible effect on our measurements. We also find that galaxies are
more concentrated at higher redshifts. We interpret this as a sign of how their
formation occurs from a smaller initial galaxy that later grows into a larger
one through mergers, consistent with the size growth of galaxies from
`inside-out', suggesting that the centres are the oldest parts of most

among children under five. Detecting malnutrition requires anthropometric
measurements of weight, height, and middle-upper arm circumference. However,
measuring them accurately is a challenge, especially in the global south, due
to limited resources. In this work, we propose a CNN-based approach to estimate
the height of standing children under five years from depth images collected
using a smart-phone. According to the SMART Methodology Manual [5], the
acceptable accuracy for height is less than 1.4 cm. On training our deep
learning model on 87131 depth images, our model achieved an average mean
absolute error of 1.64% on 57064 test images. For 70.3% test images, we
estimated height accurately within the acceptable 1.4 cm range. Thus, our
proposed solution can accurately detect stunting (low height-for-age) in
standing children below five years of age.

discovered family of topological kagome metals with a rich phenomenology of
strongly correlated electronic phases including charge order and
superconductivity. Understanding how the singularities inherent to the kagome
electronic structure are linked to the observed many-body phases is a topic of
great interest and relevance. Here, we combine angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and density functional theory to reveal multiple kagome-derived
van Hove singularities (vHs) coexisting near the Fermi level of CsV3Sb5 and
analyze their contribution to electronic symmetry breaking. Intriguingly, the
vHs in CsV3Sb5 have two distinct flavors - p-type and m-type - which originate
from their pure and mixed sublattice characters, respectively. This twofold vHs
is unique property of the kagome lattice, and its flavor critically determines
the pairing symmetry and ground states emerging in AV3Sb5 series. We establish
that, among the multiple vHs in CsV3Sb5, the m-type vHs of the dxz/dyz kagome
band and the p-type vHs of the dxy/dx2-y2 kagome band cross the Fermi level to
set the stage for electronic symmetry breaking. The former band exhibits
pronounced Fermi surface nesting, while the latter contributes via higher-order
vHs. Our work reveals the essential role of kagome-derived vHs for the
collective phenomena realized in the AV3Sb5 family, paving the way to a deeper
understanding of strongly correlated topological kagome systems.

reasoning along different axes (e.g., color, texture, or shape). Insights into
what might be important for measuring similarity can can be provided by
annotated attributes, but prior work tends to view these annotations as
complete, resulting in them using a simplistic approach of predicting
attributes on single images, which are, in turn, used to measure similarity.
However, it is impractical for a dataset to fully annotate every attribute that
may be important. Thus, only representing images based on these incomplete
annotations may miss out on key information. To address this issue, we propose
the Pairwise Attribute-informed similarity Network (PAN), which breaks
similarity learning into capturing similarity conditions and relevance scores
from a joint representation of two images. This enables our model to identify
that two images contain the same attribute, but can have it deemed irrelevant
(e.g., due to fine-grained differences between them) and ignored for measuring
similarity between the two images. Notably, while prior methods of using
attribute annotations are often unable to outperform prior art, PAN obtains a
4-9% improvement on compatibility prediction between clothing items on Polyvore

approximate optimal incremental control strategy, which stabilizes the
controlled system incrementally under model uncertainties, environmental
disturbances, and input saturation. By leveraging the time delay estimation
(TDE) technique, we first exploit sensory data to reduce the requirement of a
complete dynamics, where measured data are adopted to construct an incremental
dynamics that reflects the system evolution in an incremental form. Then, the
resulting incremental dynamics serves to design the approximate optimal
incremental control strategy based on adaptive dynamic programming, which is
implemented as a simplified single critic structure to get the approximate
solution to the value function of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.
Furthermore, for the critic artificial neural network, experience data are used
to design an off-policy weight update law with guaranteed weight convergence.
Rather importantly, to address the unintentionally introduced TDE error, we
incorporate a TDE error bound related term into the cost function, whereby the
TDE error is attenuated during the optimization process. The system stability
proof and the weight convergence proof are provided. Numerical simulations are
conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed IADP,
especially regarding the reduced control energy expenditure and the enhanced
robustness.

devices in the simulation of quantum many-body problems have been dominated by
the use of a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). These coupled
quantum-classical algorithms leverage the ability to perform many repeated
measurements to avoid the currently prohibitive gate depths often required for
exact quantum algorithms, with the restriction of a parameterized circuit to
describe the states of interest. In this work, we show how the calculation of
zero-temperature dynamic correlation functions defining the linear response
characteristics of quantum systems can also be recast into a modified VQE
algorithm, which can be incorporated into the current variational quantum
infrastructure. This allows for these important physical expectation values
describing the dynamics of the system to be directly converged on the frequency
axis, and they approach exactness over all frequencies as the flexibility of
the parameterization increases. The frequency resolution hence does not
explicitly scale with gate depth, which is approximately twice as deep as a
ground state VQE. We apply the method to compute the single-particle Green's
function of ab initio dihydrogen and lithium hydride molecules, and demonstrate
the use of a practical active space embedding approach to extend to larger
systems. While currently limited by the fidelity of two-qubit gates, whose
number is increased compared to the ground state algorithm on current devices,
we believe the approach shows potential for the extraction of frequency

on the projection side. For orthogonal projections, quantitative estimates rely
on a separation condition: most points are well-differentiated by most
projections. It turns out that this idea also applies to a broad class of
nonlinear projection-type operators satisfying a \textit{transversality
condition}. In this work, we establish that several important classes of
nonlinear projections are transversal. This leads to quantitative lower bounds
for decay rates for nonlinear variants of Favard length, including Favard curve
length (as well as a new generalization to higher dimensions, called Favard
surface length) and visibility measurements associated to radial projections.
As one application, we provide a simplified proof for the decay rate of the
Favard curve length of generations of the four corner Cantor set, first
established by Cladek, Davey, and Taylor.

to provide a better opportunity for the developers to make software development
robust and easy. At the early stage, a programming language is likely to have
resource constraints that encourage the developers to seek help frequently from
experienced peers active in QA sites such as Stack Overflow (SO). In this
study, we have formally studied the discussions on three popular new languages
introduced after the inception of SO (2008) and match those with the relevant
activities in GitHub whenever appropriate. For that purpose, we have mined
4,17,82,536 questions and answers from SO and 7,846 issue information along
with 6,60,965 repository information from GitHub. Initially, the development of
new languages is relatively slow compared to mature languages (e.g., C, C++,
Java). The expected outcome of this study is to reveal the difficulties and
challenges faced by the developers working with these languages so that
appropriate measures can be taken to expedite the generation of relevant
resources. We have used the LDA method on SO's questions and answers to
identify different topics of new languages. We have extracted several features
of the answer pattern of the new languages from SO to study their
characteristics. These attributes were used to identify difficult topics. We
explored the background of developers who are contributing to these languages.
We have created a model by combining Stack Overflow data and issues,
repository, user data of GitHub. Finally, we have used that model to identify
factors that affect language evolution. We believe that the outcome of our
study is likely to help the owner/sponsor of these languages to design better
features and documentation. It will also help the software developers or
students to prepare themselves to work on these languages in an informed way.

global population. The pandemic has been so prominent partly due to the high
infection rate of the virus and its variants. In response, one of the most
effective ways to stop infection is rapid diagnosis. The main-stream screening
method, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is
time-consuming, laborious and in short supply. Chest radiography is an
alternative screening method for the COVID-19 and computer-aided diagnosis
(CAD) has proven to be a viable solution at low cost and with fast speed;
however, one of the challenges in training the CAD models is the limited number
of training data, especially at the onset of the pandemic. This becomes
outstanding precisely when the quick and cheap type of diagnosis is critically
needed for flattening the infection curve. To address this challenge, we
propose the use of a low-shot learning approach named imprinted weights, taking
advantage of the abundance of samples from known illnesses such as pneumonia to
improve the detection performance on COVID-19.

Astronomy. Modern ML methods can be characterized as highly resistant to some
experimental errors. However, small changes on the data over long distances or
long periods of time, which cannot be easily detected by statistical methods,
can be harmful to these methods. We develop a new strategy to cope with this
problem, also using ML methods in an innovative way, to identify these
potentially harmful features. We introduce and discuss the notion of Drifting
Features, related with small changes in the properties as measured in the data
features. We use the identification of RRLs in VVV based on an earlier work and
introduce a method for detecting Drifting Features. Our method forces a
classifier to learn the tile of origin of diverse sources (mostly stellar
'point sources'), and select the features more relevant to the task of finding
candidates to Drifting Features. We show that this method can efficiently
identify a reduced set of features that contains useful information about the
tile of origin of the sources. For our particular example of detecting RRLs in
VVV, we find that Drifting Features are mostly related to color indices. On the
other hand, we show that, even if we have a clear set of Drifting Features in
our problem, they are mostly insensitive to the identification of RRLs.
Drifting Features can be efficiently identified using ML methods. However, in
our example, removing Drifting Features does not improve the identification of
RRLs.

interested in the convergence rate of the maximum likelihood supertree.
Previous studies on the maximum likelihood supertree approach often formulate
the question of interest as a discrete problem and focus on reconstructing the
correct topology of the species tree. Aiming to reconstruct both the topology

analyzing the convergence of the maximum likelihood supertree method.
Specifically, we consider each tree as one point of a metric space and prove

  Phase Shift","10 pages, 4 figures",,"10.1016/j.physleta.2021.127674",,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We investigate the role of a time and spin-dependent phase shift on the
evolution of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks. By employing Floquet
engineering, a time and spin-dependent phase shift ($\phi$) is imprinted onto
the walker's wave function while it shifts from one lattice site to another.
For a quantum walk driven by the standard protocol we show with our numerical
simulations that complete revivals with equal periods occur in the probability
distribution of the walk for rational values of the phase factor, i.e.,
$\phi/2\pi = p/q$. For an irrational value of $\phi/2\pi$ our results show
partial revivals in the probability distribution with unpredictable periods,
and the walker remains localized in a small region of the lattice. We further
investigate revivals in a split-step quantum walk with a time and
spin-dependent phase shift for rational values of $\phi/2\pi$. In contrast to
the case of standard protocol, the split-step quantum walk shows partial
revivals in the probability distribution. Furthermore, in view of an
experimental realization we investigate the robustness of revivals against
noise in the phase shift. Our results show that signatures of revivals persist
for smaller values of the noise parameter, while revivals vanish for larger
values. Our work is important in the context of quantum computation where
quantum walks with a time and spin-dependent phase shift can be used to control
and manipulate a desired quantum state on demand.

semantically relevant tables based on natural language queries. Existing
learning systems for this task often treat tables as plain text based on the
assumption that tables are structured as dataframes. However, tables can have
complex layouts which indicate diverse dependencies between subtable
structures, such as nested headers. As a result, queries may refer to different
spans of relevant content that is distributed across these structures.
Moreover, such systems fail to generalize to novel scenarios beyond those seen
in the training set. Prior methods are still distant from a generalizable
solution to the NLTR problem, as they fall short in handling complex table
layouts or queries over multiple granularities. To address these issues, we
propose Graph-based Table Retrieval (GTR), a generalizable NLTR framework with
multi-granular graph representation learning. In our framework, a table is
first converted into a tabular graph, with cell nodes, row nodes and column
nodes to capture content at different granularities. Then the tabular graph is
input to a Graph Transformer model that can capture both table cell content and
the layout structures. To enhance the robustness and generalizability of the
model, we further incorporate a self-supervised pre-training task based on
graph-context matching. Experimental results on two benchmarks show that our
method leads to significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art
systems. Further experiments demonstrate promising performance of our method on
cross-dataset generalization, and enhanced capability of handling complex
tables and fulfilling diverse query intents. Code and data are available at

irradiated at a broad dose-range of 0.03 Gy-50 Gy. Raman spectra were acquired
with a custom-built Raman micro-spectroscopy setup involving a 500 mW,
multimode 785 nm laser. The depth of focus of 34 um enabled the concurrent
collection of Raman spectra from the RCF active layer and the polyester
laminate. The pre-processed Raman spectra were normalized to the intensity of
the 1614 cm-1 Raman peak from the polyester laminate that was unaltered by
radiation. The experimental, fitting and total dose uncertainty was determined

the RCF, even down to 0.03 Gy, was obtained in this study. The dynamic range of
the calibration curves based on all three Raman peaks in the RCF extended up to
50 Gy with no saturation. At a spatial resolution of 30X30 um^2, the total
uncertainty in estimating dose in the 0.5 Gy to 50 Gy dose range was [6 - 9]%
for all three Raman calibration curves. This consisted of the experimental
uncertainty of [5 - 8]%, and the fitting uncertainty of [2.5 - 4.5]%.
Conclusions: The high spatial resolution experimental dosimetry technique based
on Raman micro-spectroscopy and RCF presented here, could become useful for
applications in, as well as for applications based on small field dosimetry.

a notoriously complex electronic structure that is characterized by a high
density of states that is sensitive to geometric changes. The spectral
sensitivity to subtle geometric changes has received little attention from
fully-correlated calculations, owing partly to the exceptional computational
complexity for treating these large and correlated systems accurately. To
provide insight into this aspect, we report the first Complete Active Space
Self Consistent Field (CASSCF) calculations for different geometries of
cubane-based clusters using two complementary, fully-correlated solvers:
spin-pure Adaptive Sampling Configuration Interaction (ASCI) and Density Matrix
Renormalization Group (DMRG). We find that the previously established picture
of a double-exchange driven magnetic structure, with minute energy gaps (< 1
mHa) between consecutive spin states, has a weak dependence on the underlying
geometry. However, the spin gap between the lowest singlet and the highest spin
states is strongly geometry dependent, changing by an order of magnitude upon
slight deformations that are still within biologically relevant parameters. The
CASSCF orbital optimization procedure, using active spaces as large as 86
electrons in 52 orbitals, was found to reduce this gap by a factor of two
compared to typical mean-field orbital approaches. Our results clearly

advantage, but current quantum devices suffer from the rapid accumulation of
error that prevents the storage of quantum information over extended periods.
The unintentional coupling of qubits to their environment and each other adds
significant noise to computation, and improved methods to combat decoherence
are required to boost the performance of quantum algorithms on real machines.
While many existing techniques for mitigating error rely on adding extra gates
to the circuit, calibrating new gates, or extending a circuit's runtime, this
paper's primary contribution leverages the gates already present in a quantum
program without extending circuit duration. We exploit circuit slack for
single-qubit gates that occur in idle windows, scheduling the gates such that
their timing can counteract some errors.
  Spin-echo corrections that mitigate decoherence on idling qubits act as
inspiration for this work. Theoretical models, however, fail to capture all
sources of noise in NISQ devices, making practical solutions necessary that
better minimize the impact of unpredictable errors in quantum machines. This
paper presents TimeStitch: a novel framework that pinpoints the optimum
execution schedules for single-qubit gates within quantum circuits. TimeStitch,
implemented as a compilation pass, leverages the reversible nature of quantum
computation to boost the success of circuits on real quantum machines.

the BHTSU will increase the brilliance at the beamline by over one order of
magnitude in comparison to other state-of-the-art undulator technologies and

One of the key challenges for designing a 1-meter-long (100 periods) BHTSU is
the large-scale simulation of the magnetization currents inside 200
staggered-array bulk superconductors. A feasible approach to simplify the
electromagnetic model is to retain five periods from both ends of the
1-meter-long BHTSU, reducing the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) to the
scale of millions. In this paper, the theory of the recently-proposed 2D A-V
formulation-based backward computation method is extended to calculate the
critical state magnetization currents in the ten-period staggered-array BHTSU

3D H-formulation and the highly efficient 3D H-{\phi} formulation method, all

multiplication of encrypted values by the addition of their logarithmic

The computer/server performs blackbox additions and is based on the separation
of server/device/hardware, such as the enclave, that may deal with additions of

computer operations and to use part of the variable for computation
verification (computation fingerprints) and the other for the actual
calculation. The verification part holds the FHE value, of which the calculated
result is known (either due to computing locally once or from previous verified
computations) and will be checked against the returned FHE value. We prove that
a server with bit computation granularity can return consistent encrypted wrong
results even when the public key is not provided. For the case of computer word
granularity the verification and the actual calculation parts are separated,
the verification part (the consecutive bits from the LSB to the MSB of the

human verification, and statistical analysis to estimate the spatial
distribution of surveillance cameras. Specifically, we build a camera detection

cloud and a monocular camera image, a depth completion network is employed to
produce dense point cloud that is subsequently processed by a voxel-based
network for 3D object detection. Evaluated with KITTI dataset for 3D object
detection in Bird-Eye View (BEV), the experimental result shows that the
proposed approach performs significantly better than directly applying the
16-line LiDAR point cloud for object detection. For both easy and moderate
cases, our 3D vehicle detection results are close to those using 64-line

natural in that they map sets of colors that are perceptually similar to

violation of a Clauser-Horne-Shimony inequality by the experimental data

planning algorithms exist, but few attempts have been made to benchmark the

advances in deep neural networks, there is an urgent need to facilitate the
development and benchmarking of such learning-based planning algorithms. This
paper presents PathBench, a platform for developing, visualizing, training,
testing, and benchmarking of existing and future, classical and learned 2D and
3D path planning algorithms, while offering support for Robot Oper-ating System
(ROS). Many existing path planning algorithms are supported; e.g. A*,
wavefront, rapidly-exploring random tree, value iteration networks, gated path
planning networks; and integrating new algorithms is easy and clearly
specified. We demonstrate the benchmarking capability of PathBench by comparing
implemented classical and learned algorithms for metrics, such as path length,
success rate, computational time and path deviation. These evaluations are done
on built-in PathBench maps and external path planning environments from video
games and real world databases. PathBench is open source.

integer $k$ and a constraint predicate $\Pi$ mapping permutations on
$\{1,\ldots,k\}$ to $\{0,1\}$. Given an instance of OCSP$(\Pi)$ on $n$
variables and $m$ constraints, the goal is to find an ordering of the $n$
variables that maximizes the number of constraints that are satisfied, where a
constraint specifies a sequence of $k$ distinct variables and the constraint is
satisfied by an ordering on the $n$ variables if the ordering induced on the
$k$ variables in the constraint satisfies $\Pi$. OCSPs capture natural problems
including ""Maximum acyclic subgraph (MAS)"" and ""Betweenness"".
  In this work we consider the task of approximating the maximum number of
satisfiable constraints in the (single-pass) streaming setting, where an
instance is presented as a stream of constraints. We show that for every $\Pi$,
OCSP$(\Pi)$ is approximation-resistant to $o(n)$-space streaming algorithms.
This space bound is tight up to polylogarithmic factors. In the case of MAS our
result shows that for every $\epsilon>0$, MAS is not
$1/2+\epsilon$-approximable in $o(n)$ space. The previous best
inapproximability result only ruled out a $3/4$-approximation in $o(\sqrt n)$

Velusamy who show tight, linear-space inapproximability results for a broad
class of (non-ordering) constraint satisfaction problems over arbitrary
(finite) alphabets. We design a family of appropriate CSPs (one for every $q$)
from any given OCSP, and apply their work to this family of CSPs. We show that
the hard instances from this earlier work have a particular ""small-set

with the hardness results of the resulting families of CSPs, we give optimal
inapproximability results for all OCSPs.

and business applications. Trace regression is a widely used method to model
effects of matrix predictors and has shown great success in matrix learning.
However, nearly all existing trace regression solutions rely on two
assumptions: (i) a known functional form of the conditional mean, and (ii) a
global low-rank structure in the entire range of the regression function, both
of which may be violated in practice. In this article, we relax these
assumptions by developing a general framework for nonparametric trace
regression models via structured sign series representations of high
dimensional functions. The new model embraces both linear and nonlinear trace
effects, and enjoys rank invariance to order-preserving transformations of the
response. In the context of matrix completion, our framework leads to a
substantially richer model based on what we coin as the ""sign rank"" of a
matrix. We show that the sign series can be statistically characterized by
weighted classification tasks. Based on this connection, we propose a learning
reduction approach to learn the regression model via a series of classifiers,
and develop a parallelable computation algorithm to implement sign series
aggregations. We establish the excess risk bounds, estimation error rates, and
sample complexities. Our proposal provides a broad nonparametric paradigm to
many important matrix learning problems, including matrix regression, matrix
completion, multi-task learning, and compressed sensing. We demonstrate the
advantages of our method through simulations and two applications, one on brain
connectivity study and the other on high-rank image completion.

hard for bounded-degree graphs. We present new algorithmic results for

for spin systems in the non-uniqueness region on random regular bipartite

$q=O\big(\tfrac{\Delta}{\log{\Delta}}\big)$ on almost every $\Delta$-regular

algorithm for general graphs in the uniqueness region and improves
significantly upon the previous best bound of
$q=O\big(\tfrac{\sqrt{\Delta}}{(\log\Delta)^2}\big)$ by Jenssen, Keevash, and
Perkins (SODA'19). Analogously, for the hard-core model on independent sets
weighted by $\lambda>0$, we present an $\mathsf{FPRAS}$ for estimating the
partition function when $\lambda=\Omega\big(\tfrac{\log{\Delta}}{\Delta}\big)$,
which improves upon previous results by an $\Omega(\log \Delta)$ factor. Our
results for the colorings and hard-core models follow from a general result
that applies to arbitrary spin systems. Our main contribution is to show how to
elevate probabilistic/analytic bounds on the marginal probabilities for the
typical structure of phases on random bipartite regular graphs into efficient
algorithms, using the polymer method. We further show evidence that our result
for colorings is within a constant factor of best possible using current

require transcribed speech nor speaker labels, and, furthermore, can be trained
in a multilingual fashion, thus achieving speaker normalization even if only
few unlabeled data is available from the target language. The speaker
normalization is done by mapping all utterances to a medoid style which is

learned dynamic texture model that accounts for photo-realistic
motion-dependent appearance details, as well as view-dependent lighting

coherent mesh geometry that is augmented with high-quality dynamic textures
dependent on motion and view point. As input to the model, only an arbitrary 3D
skeleton motion is required, making it directly compatible with the established
3D animation pipeline. We use a novel graph convolutional network architecture
to enable motion-dependent deformation learning of body and clothing, including
dynamics, and a neural generative dynamic texture model creates corresponding

extensible simulation framework that can perform architectural explorations
with SNNs, including both platform-based design of today's hardware, and
hardware-software co-design and design-technology co-optimization of the
future. We present NeuroXplorer, a fast and extensible framework that is based
on a generalized template for modeling a neuromorphic architecture that can be
infused with the specific details of a given hardware and/or technology.
NeuroXplorer can perform both low-level cycle-accurate architectural
simulations and high-level analysis with data-flow abstractions. NeuroXplorer's
optimization engine can incorporate hardware-oriented metrics such as energy,
throughput, and latency, as well as SNN-oriented metrics such as inter-spike
interval distortion and spike disorder, which directly impact SNN performance.
We demonstrate the architectural exploration capabilities of NeuroXplorer
through case studies with many state-of-the-art machine learning models.

In this work we study Eridanus II, a dwarf spheroidal satellite which hosts a
star cluster, using published and archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope
Advanced Camera for Surveys. We employ a Bayesian hierarchical method to infer
the star formation history of Eridanus II. We find that the bulk of the stars
in Eridanus II are very old ($13.5_{-1}^{+0.5}$ Gyr) and quite metal poor
($Z$\,=\,$0.00001$). We do not find any evidence of the presence of an
intermediate age or young population in Eri II. We cannot date the embedded
star cluster as a separate entity, but we find it likely that the cluster has a
similar age and metallicity as the bulk of the stars in Eri II.
  The existence of an old star cluster in a dark matter dominated old metal
poor dwarf galaxy is of major importance to cast light on the dark matter
distribution within dwarf galaxies. The existence of intermediate age stars is
required by the recent detection of carbon stars in Eri II. Since no recent
star formation is detected, {\it blue-straggler} fusions of lower mass stars
are the most likely origin of the carbon star progenitors.

pervasive/ubiquitous devices that generate zettabytes (ZB) of real-time data
streams. Designing accurate models using such data streams, to predict future
insights and revolutionize the decision-taking process, inaugurates pervasive
systems as a worthy paradigm for a better quality-of-life. The confluence of
pervasive computing and artificial intelligence, Pervasive AI, expanded the
role of ubiquitous IoT systems from mainly data collection to executing
distributed computations with a promising alternative to centralized learning,
presenting various challenges. In this context, a wise cooperation and resource
scheduling should be envisaged among IoT devices (e.g., smartphones, smart

overcome these resource challenges in pervasive AI systems. Specifically, we
first present an overview of the pervasive computing, its architecture, and its

  Applications",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital component of medical imaging.
When compared to other image modalities, it has advantages such as the absence
of radiation, superior soft tissue contrast, and complementary multiple
sequence information. However, one drawback of MRI is its comparatively slow
scanning and reconstruction compared to other image modalities, limiting its
usage in some clinical applications when imaging time is critical. Traditional
compressive sensing based MRI (CS-MRI) reconstruction can speed up MRI
acquisition, but suffers from a long iterative process and noise-induced
artefacts. Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been used in sparse MRI
reconstruction models to recreate relatively high-quality images from heavily
undersampled k-space data, allowing for much faster MRI scanning. However,
there are still some hurdles to tackle. For example, directly training DNNs
based on L1/L2 distance to the target fully sampled images could result in
blurry reconstruction because L1/L2 loss can only enforce overall image or
patch similarity and does not take into account local information such as
anatomical sharpness. It is also hard to preserve fine image details while
maintaining a natural appearance. More recently, Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN) based methods are proposed to solve fast MRI with enhanced image
perceptual quality. The encoder obtains a latent space for the undersampling
image, and the image is reconstructed by the decoder using the GAN loss. In
this chapter, we review the GAN powered fast MRI methods with a comparative
study on various anatomical datasets to demonstrate the generalisability and
robustness of this kind of fast MRI while providing future perspectives.

requirement in resource allocation. With indivisible goods, such fair
allocations are unfortunately not guaranteed to exist. Classical works have
avoided this issue by introducing an additional divisible resource, i.e.,
money, to subsidize envious agents. In this paper, we aim to design a truthful
allocation mechanism of indivisible goods to achieve both fairness and
efficiency criteria with a limited amount of subsidy. Following the work of
Halpern and Shah, our central question is as follows: to what extent do we need
to rely on the power of money to accomplish these objectives? For general
valuations, the impossibility theorem of combinatorial auction translates to
our setting: even if an arbitrarily large amount of money is available for use,
no mechanism can achieve truthfulness, envy-freeness, and utilitarian
optimality simultaneously when agents have general monotone submodular
valuations. By contrast, we show that, when agents have matroidal valuations,
there is a truthful allocation mechanism that achieves envy-freeness and
utilitarian optimality by subsidizing each agent with at most $1$, the maximum
marginal contribution of each item for each agent. The design of the mechanism
rests crucially on the underlying matroidal M-convexity of the Lorenz
dominating allocations.

focuses on applications which make soft real time requests to perform inference
on their data - they desire prompt responses within designated deadlines, but
occasional deadline misses are acceptable. Supporting soft real time
applications on a multi-tenant edge server is not easy, since the requests
sharing the limited GPU computing resources of an edge server interfere with
each other. In order to tackle this problem, we comprehensively evaluate how
latency and throughput respond to different GPU execution plans. Based on this
analysis, we propose a GPU scheduler, DeepRT, which provides latency guarantee
to the requests while maintaining high overall system throughput. The key
component of DeepRT, DisBatcher, batches data from different requests as much
as possible while it is proven to provide latency guarantee for requests
admitted by an Admission Control Module. DeepRT also includes an Adaptation
Module which tackles overruns. Our evaluation results show that DeepRT
outperforms state-of-the-art works in terms of the number of deadline misses

image. The image polarization is determined by effects including the
orientation of the magnetic field in the emitting region, relativistic motion
of the gas, strong gravitational lensing by the black hole, and parallel
transport in the curved spacetime. We explore these effects using a simple
model of an axisymmetric, equatorial accretion disk around a Schwarzschild
black hole. By using an approximate expression for the null geodesics derived
by Beloborodov (2002) and conservation of the Walker-Penrose constant, we
provide analytic estimates for the image polarization. We test this model using
currently favored general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of M87*,
using ring parameters given by the simulations. For a subset of these with
modest Faraday effects, we show that the ring model broadly reproduces the
polarimetric image morphology. Our model also predicts the polarization
evolution for compact flaring regions, such as those observed from Sgr A* with
GRAVITY. With suitably chosen parameters, our simple model can reproduce the
EVPA pattern and relative polarized intensity in Event Horizon Telescope images
of M87*. Under the physically motivated assumption that the magnetic field
trails the fluid velocity, this comparison is consistent with the clockwise
rotation inferred from total intensity images.

Sparse data are augmented with prior information through the imposition of

contributions of the superconducting fluctuations to the third-harmonic
magnetic response, denoted here by $\overline{M_{3}}$, which can be measured in
a precise way using ac magnetic fields and lock-in techniques. We show that, in
an intermediate temperature regime, this quantity behaves as the third-order
nonlinear susceptibility, which shows a power-law dependence with the reduced
temperature $\epsilon=\frac{T-T_{c}}{T_{c}}$ as $\epsilon^{-5/2}$. Very close
to $T_{c}$, however, $\overline{M_{3}}$ saturates due to the nonzero amplitude
of the ac field. We compare our theoretical results with experimental data for
three conventional superconductors -- lead, niobium, and vanadium -- and for
the unconventional superconductor Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ (SRO). We find good
agreement between theory and experiment for the elemental superconductors,
although the theoretical values for the critical field systematically deviate
from the experimental ones. In the case of SRO, however, the phenomenological
model completely fails to describe the data, as the third-harmonic response
remains sizable over a much wider reduced temperature range compared to Pb, Nb,
and V. We show that an inhomogeneous distribution of $T_{c}$ can partially
account for this discrepancy, since regions with a locally higher $T_{c}$
contribute to the fluctuation $\overline{M_{3}}$ significantly more than
regions with the ""nominal"" $T_{c}$ of the clean system. However, the
exponential temperature dependence of $\overline{M_{3}}$ first reported in Ref.
[3] is not captured by the model with inhomogeneity. We conclude that, while
inhomogeneity is an important ingredient to understand the superconducting
fluctuations of SRO and other perovskite superconductors, additional effects
may be at play, such as non-Gaussian fluctuations or rare-region effects.

era when connected and autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructure are

expected to persist for quite some time. Towards this end it is necessary that
we have a comprehensive modeling framework for decision-making within which
human driving preferences can be inferred statistically from observed driving
behaviors in realistic and naturalistic traffic settings. Leveraging a recently
proposed computational framework for smart vehicles in a smart world using
multi-agent based simulation and optimization, we first recapitulate how the
forward problem of driving decision-making is modeled as a state space model.
We then show how the model can be inverted to estimate driver preferences from
naturalistic traffic data using the standard Kalman filter technique. We
explicitly illustrate our approach using the vehicle trajectory data from
Sugiyama experiment that was originally meant to demonstrate how stop-and-go
shockwave can arise spontaneously without bottlenecks. Not only the estimated
state filter can fit the observed data well for each individual vehicle, the
inferred utility functions can also re-produce quantitatively similar pattern
of the observed collective behaviors. One distinct advantage of our approach is
the drastically reduced computational burden. This is possible because our
forward model treats driving decision process, which is intrinsically dynamic
with multi-agent interactions, as a sequence of independent static optimization
problems contingent on the state with a finite look ahead anticipation.
Consequently we can practically sidestep solving an interacting dynamic
inversion problem that would have been much more computationally demanding.

error of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we
use theoretical analysis and symbolic algebra to find exact expressions for the
coefficients of the generic global truncation error. Our analysis is valid for
any hyperbolic PDE, be it linear or non-linear, and employing finite
difference, finite volume, or finite element discretization in space, and
advanced in time with a predictor-corrector, multistep, or a deferred
correction method, belonging to the Method of Lines. Furthermore, we discuss
the practical implications of this analysis. If we employ a stable numerical
scheme and the orders of accuracy of the global solution error and the global
truncation error agree, we make the following asymptotic observations: (a) the
order of convergence at constant ratio of $\Delta t$ to $\Delta x$ is governed
by the minimum of the orders of the spatial and temporal discretizations, and
(b) convergence cannot even be guaranteed under only spatial or temporal
refinement. An implication of (a) is that it is impractical to invest in a
time-stepping method of order higher than the spatial discretization. In
addition to (b), we demonstrate that under certain circumstances, the error can
even monotonically increase with refinement only in space or only in time, and
explain why this phenomenon occurs. To verify our theoretical findings, we
conduct convergence studies of linear and non-linear advection equations using
finite difference and finite volume spatial discretizations, and
predictor-corrector and multistep time-stepping methods. Finally, we study the
effect of slope limiters and monotonicity-preserving strategies on the order of

expensive. Our investigation has found that the most time-consuming component
of the HE-based linear computation is a series of Permutation (Perm) operations
that are imperative for dot product and convolution in privacy-preserved MLaaS.
To this end, we propose GALA: Greedy computAtion for Linear Algebra in
privacy-preserved neural networks, which views the HE-based linear computation
as a series of Homomorphic Add, Mult and Perm operations and chooses the least
expensive operation in each linear computation step to reduce the overall cost.
GALA makes the following contributions: (1) It introduces a row-wise weight
matrix encoding and combines the share generation that is needed for the
GC-based nonlinear computation, to reduce the Perm operations for the dot
product; (2) It designs a first-Add-second-Perm approach (named kernel
grouping) to reduce Perm operations for convolution. As such, GALA efficiently
reduces the cost for the HE-based linear computation, which is a critical
building block in almost all of the recent frameworks for privacy-preserved
neural networks, including GAZELLE (Usenix Security'18), DELPHI (Usenix
Security'20), and CrypTFlow2 (CCS'20). With its deep optimization of the

these systems to further boost their efficiency. Our experiments show that it

segment lesions as now since much more heavy laboring will be required. In this
paper, we present a prior-guided dual-path network (PDNet) to segment common
types of lesions throughout the whole body and predict their RECIST diameters
accurately and automatically. Similar to [1], a click guidance from
radiologists is the only requirement. There are two key characteristics in

the current generation of COBOL developers retires. Furthermore, due to the
limited availability of public COBOL resources, entry-level developers, who
assume the mantle of legacy COBOL systems maintainers, face significant
difficulties during routine maintenance tasks, such as code comprehension and
defect location. While we made substantial advances in the field of software
maintenance for modern programming languages yearly, mainframe maintenance has
received limited attention. With this study, we aim to direct the attention of
researchers and practitioners towards investigating and addressing challenges
associated with mainframe development. Specifically, we explore the scope of
defects affecting COBOL systems and defect location strategies commonly
followed by COBOL developers and compare them with the modern programming
language counterparts. To this end, we surveyed 30 COBOL and 74 modern
Programming Language (PL) developers to understand the differences in defects
and defect location strategies employed by the two groups. Our preliminary
results show that: (1) major defect categories affecting the COBOL ecosystem
are different than defects encountered in modern PL software projects; (2) the
most challenging defect types in COBOL are also the ones that occur most
frequently; and (3) COBOL and modern PL developers follow similar strategies to
locate defective code.

particle has been measured somewhere in the right Rindler wedge. From an
orthodox point of view, the change in the field state induced by the
measurement is non-local and occurs both in the left and right Rindler wedges.
If one takes semiclassical gravity seriously in this context, this seems to
open the possiblity for designing superluminal communication protocols between
two spacelike separated observers confined to the right and left Rindler wedges
respectively. We discuss the possible ways in which physics could prevent such

We present a number of results. For MIS in the $k$-machine model, we improve
the $\tilde{O}(m/k^2 + \Delta/k)$-round upper bound of Klauck et al. (SODA
2015) by presenting an $\tilde{O}(m/k^2)$-round algorithm. We also present an
$\tilde{\Omega}(n/k^2)$ round lower bound for MIS, the first lower bound for a
symmetry breaking problem in the $k$-machine model. For $\beta$-ruling sets, we
use hierarchical sampling to obtain more efficient algorithms in the
$k$-machine model and also in the graph streaming model. More specifically, we
obtain a $k$-machine algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(\beta
n\Delta^{1/\beta}/k^2)$ rounds and, by using a similar hierarchical sampling
technique, we obtain one-pass algorithms for both insertion-only and
insertion-deletion streams that use $O(\beta \cdot n^{1+1/2^{\beta-1}})$ space.
The latter result establishes a clear separation between MIS, which is known to
require $\Omega(n^2)$ space (Cormode et al., ICALP 2019), and $\beta$-ruling
sets, even for $\beta = 2$. Finally, we present an even faster 2-ruling set

epitaxial thin films. The delafossite ABO2, which has a rhombohedral structure,
is a good example that often forms twin domains. Although bulk metallic
delafossites are known to be the most conducting oxides, the high conductivity
is yet to be realized in thin film forms. Suppressed conductivity found in thin
films is mainly caused by the formation of twin domains, and their boundaries
can be a source of scattering centers for charge carriers. To overcome this
challenge, the underlying mechanism for their formation must be understood, so
that such defects can be controlled and eliminated. Here, we report the origin
of structural twins formed in a CuCrO2 delafossite thin film on a substrate
with hexagonal or triangular symmetries. A robust heteroepitaxial relationship
is found for the delafossite film with the substrate, and the surface
termination turns out to be critical to determine and control the domain
structure of epitaxial delafossites. Based on such discoveries, we also
demonstrate a twin-free epitaxial thin films grown on high-miscut substrates.
This finding provides an important synthesis strategy for growing single domain
delafossite thin films and can be applied to other delafossites for epitaxial
synthesis of high-quality thin films.

where boundary conditions may be ill-defined, and data-absent scenarios, where
typical supervised learning approaches will fail. Here, we further explore the
use of this modeling methodology to surrogate modeling of a fluid dynamical
system, and demonstrate additional undiscussed and interesting advantages of
such a modeling methodology over conventional data-driven approaches: 1)
improving the model's predictive performance even with incomplete description
of the underlying physics; 2) improving the robustness of the model to noise in
the dataset; 3) reduced effort to convergence during optimization for a new,
previously unseen scenario by transfer optimization of a pre-existing model.
Hence, we noticed the inclusion of a physics-based regularization term can
substantially improve the equivalent data-driven surrogate model in many
substantive ways, including an order of magnitude improvement in test error
when the dataset is very noisy, and a 2-3x improvement when only partial
physics is included. In addition, we propose a novel transfer optimization
scheme for use in such surrogate modeling scenarios and demonstrate an
approximately 3x improvement in speed to convergence and an order of magnitude
improvement in predictive performance over conventional Xavier initialization

applications have been working on improving the performance of CNN algorithms

grouped into three major approaches: (1) deeper and wider network architecture,
(2) automatic architecture search, and (3) convolutional attention block.
Unlike approaches (1) and (2), the convolutional attention block approach is
more flexible with lower cost. It enhances the CNN performance by extracting
more efficient features. However, the existing attention blocks focus on
enhancing the significant features, which lose some potential features in the
uncertainty information. Inspired by the test time augmentation and test-time
dropout approaches, we developed a novel convolutional uncertainty attention
block (CUAB) that can leverage the uncertainty information to improve CNN-based
models. The proposed module discovers potential information from the uncertain
regions on feature maps in computer vision tasks. It is a flexible functional
attention block that can be applied to any position in the convolutional block
in CNN models. We evaluated the CUAB with notable backbone models, ResNet and
ResNeXt, on a medical image segmentation task. The CUAB achieved a dice score
of 73% and 84% in pneumonia and pneumothorax segmentation, respectively,

The seminal work of Schlegel and Noack (JFM, 2015) provided a theorem outlining
necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure global stability in systems with

context of adaptive image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer, where
planning and follow-up CT images as well as their corresponding contours are
available for training. The study involves two datasets from different
manufacturers and institutes. The first dataset was divided into training (12
patients) and validation (6 patients), and was used to optimize and validate
the methodology, while the second dataset (14 patients) was used as an
independent test set. We carried out an extensive quantitative comparison

the quality of the generated deformation vector field (DVF). We show that MTL

strong coupling can be characterized by a level crossing of the lowest energy
levels. Here we show that adiabatically following the eigenstates across this

identification of a topologically-nontrivial low-energy excited state in the

circularly polarized pump pulse, we find that the system acquires a
non-vanishing Hall response as a result of the large overlap enhancement

transition via unitary dynamics, despite a proper definition of the Chern

contrast these results with more common quench protocols, where such features
are largely absent in the dynamics even if the post-quench Hamiltonian displays

analytically calculate the heat current that can be established through the

explore the conditions under which the diode effect emerges when inverting the

intricate dependence on the system parameters is put in evidence. Moreover,

ways to aggregate overall preferences from pairwise comparisons between
objects. In particular, it is well known that any Nash equilibrium of the zero
sum game induced by the preference matrix defines a natural solution concept
(winning distribution over objects) known as a von Neumann winner. Many
real-world problems, however, are inevitably multi-criteria, with different
pairwise preferences governing the different criteria. In this work, we
generalize the notion of a von Neumann winner to the multi-criteria setting by
taking inspiration from Blackwell's approachability. Our framework allows for
non-linear aggregation of preferences across criteria, and generalizes the
linearization-based approach from multi-objective optimization.
  From a theoretical standpoint, we show that the Blackwell winner of a
multi-criteria problem instance can be computed as the solution to a convex
optimization problem. Furthermore, given random samples of pairwise
comparisons, we show that a simple plug-in estimator achieves near-optimal
minimax sample complexity. Finally, we showcase the practical utility of our
framework in a user study on autonomous driving, where we find that the
Blackwell winner outperforms the von Neumann winner for the overall
preferences.

the puncture of the wall of the vascular access after entry, which can cause
medical complications. Simulator-based training allows clinicians to gain
cannulation experience without putting patients at risk. In this paper, we
propose to use deep-learning-based techniques for detecting, based on video,

pre-trained models based on VGG-16 and ResNet-50, light convolutional neural
networks (light CNNs), and convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs).
CRNNs consist of convolutional layers and a long short-term memory (LSTM)

results show that both the light CNN and the CRNN achieve better performance

the long-term and short-term variables are coupled in the constraints. To
overcome the challenge caused by tightly coupled stochastic constraints, we
first establish a two-stage primal-dual decomposition (PDD) method to decompose
the two-stage problem into a long-term problem and a family of short-term
subproblems. Then we propose a PDD-based stochastic successive convex

two-stage stochastic optimization problems. At each iteration, PDD-SSCA first
runs a short-term sub-algorithm to find stationary points of the short-term
subproblems associated with a mini-batch of the state samples. Then it
constructs a convex surrogate for the long-term problem based on the deep
unrolling of the short-term sub-algorithm and the back propagation method.
Finally, the optimal solution of the convex surrogate problem is solved to
generate the next iterate. We establish the almost sure convergence of PDD-SSCA

(PET) even with the recent progress in time-of-flight (TOF) resolution. In this
context, the bias between the acquired histogram, consisting of low values or
zeros, and the expected histogram, obtained from the forward projector, is
propagated to the image, resulting in a biased reconstruction. This situation
could be exacerbated with finer resolution of the TOF information, which
further sparsifies the acquired histogram. We propose a new approach to
circumvent this limitation of the classical reconstruction model. It consists
of extending the description of the reconstruction scheme to also explicitly
include the projection domain by Parameterizing the Angular Distribution of
Emission (PADE). This parametrization has greater degrees of freedom than the
log-likelihood model, which can not be harnessed in classical circumstances. We
hypothesize that with ultra-fast TOF this new approach would not only be viable
for low-count reconstruction, but also more adequate than the classical
reconstruction model. As a proof of concept, an implementation of this approach
is compared to the log-likelihood model by investigating two-dimensional
simulations of a hot spots phantom. The proposed model achieves similar
contrast recovery coefficients as MLEM except for the smallest structures where
the low-count nature of the simulations makes it difficult to draw conclusions.
However, this new model seems to converge toward less noisy solutions than
MLEM. These results suggest that the PADE approach has potential for low-count
reconstruction with ultra-fast TOF.

several spoofing detection techniques exist, they are incapable of mitigation

single antenna GPS receiver capable of tracking legitimate GPS satellite
signals and estimating the true location even during a spoofing attack. The
main challenge in building SemperFi is, unlike most wireless systems where
\emph{the data} contained in the wireless signals is important, GPS relies on
the time of arrival (ToA) of satellite signals. SemperFi is capable of
distinguishing spoofing signals and recovering legitimate GPS signals that are
even completely overshadowed by a strong adversary. We exploit the short-term
stability of inertial sensors to identify the spoofing signal and extend the
successive interference cancellation algorithm to preserve the legitimate
signal's ToA. We implement SemperFi in GNSS-SDR, an open-source
software-defined GNSS receiver, and evaluate its performance using UAV
simulators, real drones, a variety of real-world GPS datasets, and various
embedded platforms. Our evaluation results indicate that in many scenarios,
SemperFi can identify adversarial peaks by executing flight patterns that are
less than 50 m long and recover the true location within 10 seconds (Jetson
Xavier). We show that our receiver is secure against stealthy attackers who
exploit inertial sensor errors and execute seamless takeover attacks. We design
SemperFi as a pluggable module capable of generating a spoofer-free GPS signal
for processing on any commercial-off-the-shelf GPS receiver available today.
Finally, we release our implementation to the community for usage and further
research.

a recursion scheme of order $0$, for which the problem boils down to solving a
finite parity game. Since the size grows exponentially at each step, the
overall complexity is $n$-EXPTIME, which is known to be optimal. More
precisely, the transformation is linear in the size of the recursion scheme,
assuming that the arity of employed nonterminals and the size of the automaton

flows with a phase-field method, we propose a new discretization scheme for the
biharmonic term (the 4th-order derivative term) of the Cahn-Hilliard equation.
This novel scheme can significantly reduce the computational cost while
retaining the same accuracy as the original procedure. Our phase-field method
is built on top of a direct numerical simulation solver, named AFiD
(www.afid.eu) and open-sourced by our research group. It relies on a pencil
distributed parallel strategy and a FFT-based Poisson solver. To deal with
large density ratios between the two phases, a pressure split method [1] has
been applied to the Poisson solver. To further reduce computational costs, we
implement a multiple-resolution algorithm which decouples the discretizations
for the Navier-Stokes equations and the scalar equation: while a stretched
wall-resolving grid is used for the Navier-Stokes equations, for the
Cahn-Hilliard equation we use a fine uniform mesh. The present method shows
excellent computational performance for large-scale computation: on meshes up
to 8 billion nodes and 3072 CPU cores, a multiphase flow needs only slightly
less than 1.5 times the CPU time of the single-phase flow solver on the same
grid. The present method is validated by comparing the results to previous
studies for the cases of drop deformation in shear flow, including the
convergence test with mesh refinement, and breakup of a rising buoyant bubble
with density ratio up to 1000. Finally, we simulate the breakup of a big drop
and the coalescence of O(10^3) drops in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection
at a Rayleigh number of $10^8$, observing good agreement with theoretical

$^{96}$Ru collisions at 400 MeV/nucleon with two calculations scenarios for the

used Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert formula, while the latter is a simplified one of the
complete Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert formula by neglecting the radiation field for
practical calculations in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate and/or
relativistic energies. As a comparison, we also consider the static Coulomb
field formula for calculations of the electromagnetic field in heavy-ion

formula is not enough for the electromagnetic field calculation because the
absent radiation field in this formula also affects significantly the charged
pions as well as their $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio. Moreover, we also examine
effects of the electromagnetic field in these scenarios on the double
$\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio of two isobar reaction systems of $^{96}$Ru + $^{96}$Ru

$\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio of two reactions tends to be less affected by the
electromagnetic field calculation scenario and thus can still be an effective
probe of the nuclear symmetry energy in heavy-ion collisions. Therefore,
according to these findings, it is suggested that the selfconsistent

the amount of the training data for deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing
techniques in statistical learning require computation of capacity measures,
such as VC dimension, to provably bound this error. It is however unclear how
to extend these measures to DNNs and therefore the existing analyses are
applicable to simple neural networks, which are not used in practice, e.g.,
linear or shallow ones or otherwise multi-layer perceptrons. Moreover, many
theoretical error bounds are not empirically verifiable. We derive estimates of
the generalization error that hold for deep networks and do not rely on
unattainable capacity measures. The enabling technique in our approach hinges
on two major assumptions: i) the network achieves zero training error, ii) the
probability of making an error on a test point is proportional to the distance
between this point and its nearest training point in the feature space and at a
certain maximal distance (that we call radius) it saturates. Based on these
assumptions we estimate the generalization error of DNNs. The obtained estimate
scales as O(1/(\delta N^{1/d})), where N is the size of the training data and
is parameterized by two quantities, the effective dimensionality of the data as
perceived by the network (d) and the aforementioned radius (\delta), both of
which we find empirically. We show that our estimates match with the
experimentally obtained behavior of the error on multiple learning tasks using
benchmark data-sets and realistic models. Estimating training data requirements
is essential for deployment of safety critical applications such as autonomous
driving etc. Furthermore, collecting and annotating training data requires a
huge amount of financial, computational and human resources. Our empirical
estimates will help to efficiently allocate resources.

relatively low, however, non-convex optimization is unavoidable to improve
model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new post-training uniform
quantization technique considering non-convexity. We empirically show that
hyper-parameters for clipping and rounding of weights and activations can be
explored by monitoring task loss. Then, an optimally searched set of
hyper-parameters is frozen to proceed to the next layer such that an
incremental non-convex optimization is enabled for post-training quantization.
Throughout extensive experimental results using various models, our proposed

to this mechanism,nematic ($q=0$) and smectic ($q \ne 0$)bond orders with
$d$-wave form factor appear $f_{k,q}\propto \cos k_x - \cos k_y$ in both

explain the pseudogap behaviors in these compounds. The quantum interference
also induces various current orders with odd-parity form factor. For example,
we find the emergence of the charge and spin loop-current orders with $p$-wave
form factor in geometrically frustrated Hubbard models. Thus, rich quantum
phase transitions with $d$- and $p$-wave form factors are driven by the
paramagnon interference in many low-dimensional Hubbard models.

sophisticated model modifications and longer training time.In this paper, we
introduce regularization frequency (i.e., how often compression is performed

efficient compression-aware training method. For various regularization
techniques, such as weight decay and dropout, optimizing the regularization
strength is crucial to improve generalization in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
While model compression also demands the right amount of regularization, the
regularization strength incurred by model compression has been controlled only
by compression ratio. Throughout various experiments, we show that
regularization frequency critically affects the regularization strength of
model compression. Combining regularization frequency and compression ratio,
the amount of weight updates by model compression per mini-batch can be
optimized to achieve the best model accuracy. Modulating regularization
frequency is implemented by occasional model compression while conventional
compression-aware training is usually performed for every mini-batch.

recommending medications to patients with complex health conditions. Existing
approaches focus on predicting all medications for the current visit, which
often overlaps with medications from previous visits. A more clinically
relevant task is to identify medication changes.
  In this paper, we propose a new recurrent residual network, named MICRON, for
medication change prediction. MICRON takes the changes in patient health
records as input and learns to update a hidden medication vector and the
medication set recurrently with a reconstruction design. The medication vector
is like the memory cell that encodes longitudinal information of medications.
Unlike traditional methods that require the entire patient history for
prediction, MICRON has a residual-based inference that allows for sequential
updating based only on new patient features (e.g., new diagnoses in the recent
visit) more efficiently.
  We evaluated MICRON on real inpatient and outpatient datasets. MICRON
achieves 3.5% and 7.8% relative improvements over the best baseline in F1
score, respectively. MICRON also requires fewer parameters, which significantly
reduces the training time to 38.3s per epoch with 1.5x speed-up.

plasmonic-1D photonic crystal structures have been theoretically demonstrated.
The coupling between Tamm plasmon and cavity photon modes are tuned by
incorporating a low refractive index spacer layer adjacent to the metallic
layer to form their hybrid modes. Anticrossing of the modes observed at
different values of spacer layer thickness validates the strong coupling
between the two modes and causes Rabi-like splitting with different splitting
energy. Rabi-like splitting energy decreases with increasing number of periods
(N) and refractive index contrast ({\eta}) of two dielectric materials used to
make the 1D photonic crystals, and the observed variation is explained by an
analytical model. Angular and polarization dependency of the hybrid modes shows
that the polarization splitting of the lower hybrid mode is much stronger than
that of the upper hybrid mode. On further investigation, it is seen that one of
the hybrid modes remains unchanged while other mode undergoes significant
change with varying the cavity medium. This nature of the hybrid modes has been
utilized for designing self-referenced refractive index sensors for sensing
different analytes. For {\eta}=1.333 and N=10 in a hybrid structure, the
sensitivity increases from 51 nm/RIU to 201 nm/RIU with increasing cavity
thickness from 170 nm to 892 nm. For the fixed cavity thickness of 892 nm, the
sensitivity increases from 201 nm/RIU to 259 nm/RIU by increasing {\eta} from
1.333 to 1.605. The sensing parameters such as detection accuracy, quality
factor, and figure of merit for two different hybrid structures ([{\eta}=1.333,
N=10] and [{\eta}=1.605, N=6]) have been evaluated and compared. The value of
resonant reflectivity of one of the hybrid modes changes considerably with
varying analyte medium which can be used for refractive index sensing.

performance and energy-efficiency, but requires accurate performance models for
evaluating various dataflow alternatives. Such modeling relies on the notation
of tensor dataflow and the formulation of performance metrics. Recent proposed
compute-centric and data-centric notations describe the dataflow using
imperative directives. However, these two notations are less expressive and
thus lead to limited optimization opportunities and inaccurate performance
models.
  In this paper, we propose a framework TENET that models hardware dataflow of
tensor applications. We start by introducing a relation-centric notation, which
formally describes the hardware dataflow for tensor computation. The
relation-centric notation specifies the hardware dataflow, PE interconnection,
and data assignment in a uniform manner using relations. The relation-centric
notation is more expressive than the compute-centric and data-centric notations
by using more sophisticated affine transformations. Another advantage of
relation-centric notation is that it inherently supports accurate metrics
estimation, including data reuse, bandwidth, latency, and energy. TENET
computes each performance metric by counting the relations using integer set
structures and operators. Overall, TENET achieves 37.4\% and 51.4\% latency
reduction for CONV and GEMM kernels compared with the state-of-the-art
data-centric notation by identifying more sophisticated hardware dataflows.

has two inevitable drawbacks: the high computational resource costs caused by
the need to train a separate model for each latency $k$ and the insufficient
ability to encode information because each target token can only attend to a

the full-sentence model to encode the whole sentence, our decoding strategy can

any epoch during the evolution of our universe. We study their interaction with
a classical macroscopic object, like Earth or a satellite in Earth's orbit. We
set up an action that includes the interaction term between the massive
classical object and the scalar field that the domain wall is made of. We use
numerical calculations to solve the coupled equations of motion which describe
the crossing between the domain wall and the classical object. Depending on the
strength of the interaction, relative velocity and size, the object can be
either stopped by the wall, or it can pass through it inducing deformations in
the wall that cost energy. At the same time, the coupling to the scalar filed
might change the object's mass during the crossover. The fact that satellites
in Earth's orbit (or planets in Sun's orbit) can change their mass and/or lose
energy interacting with walls can be used as a new domain wall detection probe.
For example, a typical velocity precision of a satellite is about $0.5$ mm/s,
which directly puts an upper limit on its mass change to $\Delta M/M
\lessapprox 5\times 10^{-17} $. Alternatively, a known satellite flyby anomaly
can easily be explained as an interaction with a closed domain wall. We also
show that the presence of matter modifies the scalar filed potential and can
locally create a bubble of the true vacuum, and thus trigger the decay of the
false vacuum. For a critical bubble which is able to expand, such an
interaction with the domain wall must be strong enough.

why they are so small compared to other masses, are still under investigation.
In this thesis, we study radiative neutrino mass models, a class of models
where small neutrino masses are generated naturally, while the energy scale at
which new physics appears is still low enough to be tested by current and
future experiments, offering a falsifiable window to test beyond the Standard
Model physics. In these models, neutrino masses are forbidden at the
tree-level, but allowed at a certain order in loops. Consequently, we get
masses suppressed by loop factors without requiring a large new physics scale
and/or small couplings. In particular, we study the systematic classifications
of the $d=7$ Majorana neutrino mass operator at one-loop order, the Weinberg
operator at three-loop order and the $d=4$ Dirac neutrino mass models at the
two-loop level. We then move to more specific models and mechanisms, analysing
the connection between the generation of radiative neutrino masses and the
stability of dark matter from a model-independent point of view, and examine a
particular realisation of the type-I seesaw which relies on the radiative
generation of Dirac Yukawa coupling. Finally, we analyse the phenomenology of

scheduling choices can lead to wide variations in performance and efficiency,
motivating the need for a fast and efficient search strategy to navigate the
vast scheduling space.
  To address this challenge, we present CoSA, a constrained-optimization-based
approach for scheduling DNN accelerators. As opposed to existing approaches
that either rely on designers' heuristics or iterative methods to navigate the

techniques. Specifically, CoSA leverages the regularities in DNN operators and
hardware to formulate the DNN scheduling space into a mixed-integer programming

solved to automatically generate a highly efficient schedule in one shot. We
demonstrate that CoSA-generated schedules significantly outperform

ungrouped meteorites to their parent bodies is thus crucial to significantly

using a sparse fully-convolutional network. For network training, we
constructed a large-scale synthetic dataset called DeformingThings4D, which
consists of 1972 animation sequences spanning 31 different animals or humanoid
categories with dense 4D annotation. Experiments show that 4DComplete 1)
reconstructs high-resolution volumetric shape and motion field from a partial
observation, 2) learns an entangled 4D feature representation that benefits
both shape and motion estimation, 3) yields more accurate and natural
deformation than classic non-rigid priors such as As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP)
deformation, and 4) generalizes well to unseen objects in real-world sequences.

choosing boundary data close to one of these bifurcations results in a ""false""

calculations of the thermal (Johnson) noise and Casimir-Polder atom-surface
attraction produced by the atom-chip. This enables us to determine the lifetime
limitations produced by spin-flip, tunneling and three-body collisional losses.
Compared with atom-chips that use thick metallic conductors and substrates,
atom-chip structures based on two-dimensional materials reduce the minimum
attainable atom-surface separation to a few 100 nm and increase the lifetimes
of the trapped atom clouds by orders of magnitude so that they are limited only
by the quality of the background vacuum. We predict that atom-chips with
two-dimensional conductors will also reduce spatial fluctuations in the
trapping potential originating from imperfections in the conductor patterns.
These advantages will enhance the performance of atom-chips for quantum sensing
applications and for fundamental studies of complex quantum systems.

limited to the early phases of development, with subsequent robot behaviours
then being hardcoded by engineers or utilised in Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) systems
that rarely achieve autonomy. We present LEADOR (Led-by-Experts Automation and
Design Of Robots) an end-to-end PD methodology for domain expert co-design,
automation and evaluation of social robots. LEADOR starts with typical PD to
co-design the interaction specifications and state and action space of the
robot. It then replaces traditional offline programming or WoZ by an in-situ,
online teaching phase where the domain expert can live-program or teach the
robot how to behave while being embedded in the interaction context. We believe
that this live teaching can be best achieved by adding a learning component to
a WoZ setup, to capture experts' implicit knowledge, as they intuitively
respond to the dynamics of the situation. The robot progressively learns an
appropriate, expert-approved policy, ultimately leading to full autonomy, even
in sensitive and/or ill-defined environments. However, LEADOR is agnostic to
the exact technical approach used to facilitate this learning process. The
extensive inclusion of the domain expert(s) in robot design represents
established responsible innovation practice, lending credibility to the system
both during the teaching phase and when operating autonomously. The combination
of this expert inclusion with the focus on in-situ development also means
LEADOR supports a mutual shaping approach to social robotics. We draw on two
previously published, foundational works from which this (generalisable)
methodology has been derived in order to demonstrate the feasibility and worth
of this approach, provide concrete examples in its application and identify
limitations and opportunities when applying this framework in new environments.

an igneous crust produced during the cooling of a magma ocean and the
segregation at depth of a metallic core. The formation and nature of the
primordial crust generated during the early stages of melting is poorly
understood, due in part to the scarcity of available samples. The newly
discovered meteorite Erg Chech 002 (EC 002) originates from one such primitive
igneous crust and has an andesite bulk composition. It derives from the partial
melting of a noncarbonaceous chondritic reservoir, with no depletion in alkalis
relative to the Sun photosphere and at a high degree of melting of around 25

compare colors of C-cluster asteroids to those of carbonaceous chondrites

CM chondrites have colors in the range of C-cluster asteroids, CO, CR and CV
chondrites being significantly redder. Also, CM chondrites powders are on
average slightly redder than the average C-cluster. The colors of C-cluster
members are further investigated by looking at color variations as a function
of asteroid diameter. We observe that the visible slope becomes bluer with
decreasing asteroids diameter, and a transition seems to be present around 20
km. We discuss the origin of this variation and, if not related to a bias in
the dataset - analysis, we conclude that it is related to the surface texture
of the objects, smaller objects being covered by rocks, while larger objects
are covered by a particulate surface. The blueing is interpreted by an
increased contribution of the first reflection in the case of rock-dominated
surfaces, which can scatter light in a Rayleigh-like manner. We do not have
unambiguous evidence of space weathering within the C-cluster based on this
analysis, however the generally bluer nature of C-cluster objects compared to
CM chondrites could be to some extent related to space weathering.

the CCF; and studied their correlation with the RVs. The sign of the
correlations appears to vary as a function of stellar spectral type, and the
transition in sign signals a noteworthy change in the stellar activity
properties where earlier type stars appear more plage dominated. These
transitions become more clearly defined when considered as a function of the
convective zone depth. Therefore, it is the convective zone depth (which can be
altered by stellar metallicity) that appears to be the underlying fundamental
parameter driving the observed activity correlations. In addition, for most of
the stars, we find that the RVs become increasingly red-shifted as activity
levels increase, which can be explained by the increase in the suppression of
convective blue-shift. However, we also find a minority of stars where the RVs
become increasingly blue-shifted as activity levels increase. Finally, using
the correlation found between activity indicators and RVs, we removed RV
signals generated by long-term changes in stellar activity. We find that
performing simple cleaning of such long-term signals enables improved planet

the Lagrange multiplier, we prove the local uniqueness of the $k$-peak

the blow-up analysis and the maximum principle associated to the nonlocal

mass-critical, and the mass-supercritical case, due to the mass-constraint

deep-learning-based systems, which learn optimal features from the data,
increased scoring accuracies for the classical sleep stages of Wake, REM, and
Non-REM. Meanwhile, it has been recognized that the statistics of transitional
stages such as pre-REM, found between Non-REM and REM, may hold additional
insight into the physiology of sleep and are now under vivid investigation. We
propose a classification system based on a simple neural network architecture
that scores the classical stages as well as pre-REM sleep in mice. When
restricted to the classical stages, the optimized network showed
state-of-the-art classification performance with an out-of-sample F1 score of
0.95 in male C57BL/6J mice. When unrestricted, the network showed lower F1
scores on pre-REM (0.5) compared to the classical stages. The result is
comparable to previous attempts to score transitional stages in other species
such as transition sleep in rats or N1 sleep in humans. Nevertheless, we
observed that the sequence of predictions including pre-REM typically
transitioned from Non-REM to REM reflecting sleep dynamics observed by human
scorers. Our findings provide further evidence for the difficulty of scoring
transitional sleep stages, likely because such stages of sleep are
under-represented in typical data sets or show large inter-scorer variability.
We further provide our source code and an online platform to run predictions

phase transition. We reveal the emergence of a cuspidal edge at the density of
states surface $N(\omega,\Delta_0)$ ($\Delta_0$ is the value of the
superconducting order parameter in the absence of magnetic impurities) and the
occurrence of the catastrophe phenomenon at the transition point. We study the
stability of such a transition with respect to the spatial fluctuations of the
magnetic impurities critical concentration $n_s$ and show that the requirement
for validity of its mean field description is unobtrusive: $\nabla \left( {\ln
{n_s}} \right) \ll \xi^{-1} $ (here $\xi$ is the superconducting coherence
length). Finally, we show that, similarly to the Lifshitz point, the $2\frac12$
order phase transition should be accompanied by the corresponding
singularities. For instance, the superconducting thermoelectric effect has a
giant peak exceeding the normal value of the Seebeck coefficient by the ratio
of the Fermi energy and the superconducting gap. The concept of the experiment
for the confirmation of $2\frac12$ order transition nature is proposed. The
obtained theoretical results can be applied for the explanation of recent
experiments with lightwave-driven gapless superconductivity, for the new
interpretation of the disorder induced transition $s_{\pm}$-$s_{++}$ states via
gapless state in multi-band superconductors, for better understanding of the
gapless color superconductivity in quantum chromodynamics, the string theory.

parameter-free (dubbed ep-free) in the sense that it does not require extrinsic

3D rotations and bone lengths rather than locations allows predicting common

fused deep features through a novel multi-view fusion layer, and reconstructs a
single consistent skeleton with temporally coherent joint rotations. We
demonstrate quantitative and qualitative results on three public datasets, and

individually distinctive black and white coat pattern. Motivated by the
labelling burden involved in constructing visual cattle identification systems,
we propose exploiting the temporal coat pattern appearance across videos as a
self-supervision signal for animal identity learning. Using an
individual-agnostic cattle detector that yields oriented bounding-boxes,
rotation-normalised tracklets of individuals are formed via
tracking-by-detection and enriched via augmentations. This produces a
`positive' sample set per tracklet, which is paired against a `negative' set
sampled from random cattle of other videos. Frame-triplet contrastive learning
is then employed to construct a metric latent space. The fitting of a Gaussian
Mixture Model to this space yields a cattle identity classifier. Results show
an accuracy of Top-1 57.0% and Top-4: 76.9% and an Adjusted Rand Index: 0.53
compared to the ground truth. Whilst supervised training surpasses this
benchmark by a large margin, we conclude that self-supervision can nevertheless
play a highly effective role in speeding up labelling efforts when initially
constructing supervision information. We provide all data and full source code

detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and confirmed by
radial velocity follow-up observations with the HARPS spectrograph. Based on
the combined analysis of TESS transit photometry and high precision radial
velocity measurements we estimate a planetary mass of 13.8 $\pm$ 1.0
M$_{Earth}$ and radius of 3.03 $\pm$ 0.15 R$_{Earth}$, implying a bulk density

(V=10.4) and old (10.1$\pm$1.4 Gyr) K dwarf star with a period of $\sim$10.69
d. Thus, TOI-220 $b$ is a new warm sub-Neptune with very precise mass and
radius determinations. A Bayesian analysis of the TOI-220 $b$ internal
structure indicates that due to the strong irradiation it receives, the low
density of this planet could be explained with a steam atmosphere in
radiative-convective equilibrium and a supercritical water layer on top of a
differentiated interior made of a silicate mantle and a small iron core.

have shown that the energy efficiency (EE) of such a network can be effectively
increased by turning off some BSs depending on User Equipments (UEs) positions.
Such mapping is obtained by using Reinforcement Learning. Its results are
stored in a so-called Radio Environment Map (REM). However, in a real network,
the number of UEs' positions patterns would go to infinity. This paper aims to
determine how to match the current set of UEs' positions to the most similar

compare several state-of-the-art distance metrics using a computer simulator:
an accurate 3D-Ray-Tracing model of the radio channel and an advanced

objects in water suspension similar to Langmuir waves mechanism in plasma is
proposed. The proposed mechanism is based on a dipole interaction between the
light wave and the non-compensated electrical charge that inevitably exists on
a nanoscale object (a virus or a nanoparticle) in water environment. The
experimental data for tobacco mosaic virus and polystyrene nanospheres are
presented to support the suggested physical mechanism. It has been demonstrated
that stimulated amplification spectral line frequencies observed experimentally
are well explained by the suggested mechanism. In particular, the absence of
lower frequency lines and the generation lines shift when changing the pH are
due to ion friction appearing in the ionic solution environment. The selection
rules observed experimentally also confirm the dipole interaction type. It has
been shown that microwave radiation on nanoscale object acoustic vibrations
frequency should appear under such scattering conditions. We demonstrate that
such conditions also allow for local selective heating of nanoscale objects by
dozens to hundreds degrees K. This effect is controlled by the optical
irradiation parameters and can be used for affecting selectively certain types

expected, nondipole contributions cause a very strong forward-backward
asymmetry in the measured emission distributions. In addition, we observe an
unexpected asymmetry with respect to the polarization direction, which depends
on the direction of the molecular fragmentation. In particular, photoelectrons
are predominantly emitted in the direction of the forward nitrogen atom. This
observation cannot be explained via asymmetries introduced by the initial bound
and final continuum electronic states of the oriented molecule. The present
simulations assign this asymmetry to a novel nontrivial effect of the recoil
imposed to the nuclei by the fast photoelectrons and high-energy photons, which
results in a propensity for the ions to break up along the axis of the recoil

are an important alternative to protocols based on public-key cryptography. In
the random oracle model, the parties and the eavesdropper have access to a
shared random function (an ""oracle""), but the parties are limited in the number
of queries they can make to the oracle. The random oracle serves as an
abstraction for black-box access to a symmetric cryptographic primitive, such
as a collision resistant hash. Unfortunately, as shown by Impagliazzo and
Rudich [STOC '89] and Barak and Mahmoody [Crypto '09], such protocols can only
guarantee limited secrecy: the key of any $\ell$-query protocol can be revealed
by an $O(\ell^2)$-query adversary. This quadratic gap between the query
complexity of the honest parties and the eavesdropper matches the gap obtained
by the Merkle's Puzzles protocol of Merkle [CACM '78].
  In this work we tackle a new aspect of key-agreement protocols in the random
oracle model: their communication complexity. In Merkle's Puzzles, to obtain
secrecy against an eavesdropper that makes roughly $\ell^2$ queries, the honest
parties need to exchange $\Omega(\ell)$ bits. We show that for protocols with
certain natural properties, ones that Merkle's Puzzle has, such high
communication is unavoidable. Specifically, this is the case if the honest
parties' queries are uniformly random, or alternatively if the protocol uses
non-adaptive queries and has only two rounds. Our proof for the first setting
uses a novel reduction from the set-disjointness problem in two-party
communication complexity. For the second setting we prove the lower bound
directly, using information-theoretic arguments.

Record (EHR) and chest X-ray (CXR) data. On the MIMIC-III and Henan-Renmin EHR
datasets, we report a detection accuracy of 77% against the Longitudinal
Adversarial Attack. On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we achieve an accuracy of 88%;
significantly improving on the state of the art of adversarial detection in
both datasets by over 10% in all settings. We propose an anomaly detection
based method using explainability techniques to detect adversarial samples
which is able to generalise to different attack methods without a need for
retraining.

measures of a composed function with the analogous decision tree complexity of
the outer function. We consider two gadgets: the AND function on 2 inputs, and
the Inner Product on a constant number of inputs. Let $IP$ denote Inner Product
on $2b$ bits.
  - If $f$ is a total Boolean function that depends on all of its inputs, the
bounded-error one-way quantum communication complexity of $f \circ IP$ equals
$\Omega(n(b-1))$.
  - If $f$ is a partial Boolean function, the deterministic one-way

  Montanaro and Osborne [arXiv'09] observed that the deterministic one-way

gadget $AND_2$.
  - There exists a function for which even the quantum non-adaptive AND

  - For symmetric functions $f$, the non-adaptive AND decision tree complexity
of $f$ is at most quadratic in the (even two-way) communication complexity of

  In view of the first point, a lower bound on non-adaptive AND decision tree

the deterministic one-way communication complexity of $F = f \circ AND_2$ is at
most $(rank(M_{F}))(1 - \Omega(1))$, where $M_{F}$ denotes the communication

evaluate and compare decision-making techniques for self-adaptation, we present
the RDMSim exemplar. RDMSim enables researchers to evaluate and compare
techniques for decision-making under environmental uncertainty that support

differential emission-line filter (DELF) technique to produce spectrophotometry
that is more accurate and more sensitive than other methods. We show that DELF
analyses are superior to classical techniques in high surface brightness
regions of galaxies and we validate the method both through simulations and via
the analysis of data from two early-type galaxies (NGC 1380 and NGC 474) and
one late-type spiral (NGC 628). We demonstrate that with adaptive optics
support or under excellent seeing conditions, the technique is capable of
producing precision (< 0.05 mag) [O III ] photometry out to distances of 40 Mpc
while providing discrimination between planetary nebulae and other
emission-line objects such as H II regions, supernova remnants, and background
galaxies. These capabilities enable us to use MUSE to measure precise PNLF
distances beyond the reach of Cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch
method, and become an additional tool for constraining the local value of the

asymptotic stationarity and regularity in terms of Clarke's and Mordukhovich's

constrained bilevel optimization problems in a novel way. Afterwards, we
suggest a solution algorithm for this class of bilevel optimization problems
which combines a penalty method with ideas from DC-programming. After a brief
convergence analysis, we present results of some numerical experiments.

slow Auger recombination in these structures. We analyze how the presence of an
additional charge in trions modifies the emission energy and oscillator
strength as compared to neutral excitons. These properties are very sensitive
to dielectric confinement and electronic correlations, which we describe
accurately using image-charge and variational Quantum Monte Carlo methods in
effective mass Hamiltonians. We observe that the giant oscillator strength of
neutral excitons is largely suppressedin trions. Both negative and positive
trions are redshifted with respect to the exciton, and their emission energy
increases with increasing dielectric mismatch between the platelet and its
surroundings, which is a consequence of the self-energy potential. Our results
are consistent with experiments in the literature, and assess on the validity

maps of images obtained through fully convolutional networks. The contour
evolution is cast as an energy minimization problem, where the aggregate energy
functional incorporates a data fit term, an explicit shape model, and accounts
for object overlap. Efficient solution neighborhood operators are proposed,
enabling optimization through metaheuristics such as simulated annealing. We
instantiate the proposed framework in the context of segmenting individual
fallen stems from high-resolution aerial multispectral imagery. We validated
our approach on 3 real-world scenes of varying complexity. The test plots were
situated in regions of the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, which
sustained a heavy bark beetle infestation. Evaluations were performed on both
the polygon and line segment level, showing that the multi-contour segmentation
can achieve up to 0.93 precision and 0.82 recall. An improvement of up to 7
percentage points (pp) in recall and 6 in precision compared to an iterative
sample consensus line segment detection was achieved. Despite the simplicity of
the applied shape parametrization, an explicit shape model incorporated into
the energy function improved the results by up to 4 pp of recall. Finally, we
show the importance of using a deep learning based semantic segmentation method
as the basis for individual stem detection. Our method is a step towards
increased accessibility of automatic fallen tree mapping, due to higher cost
efficiency of aerial imagery acquisition compared to laser scanning. The
precise fallen tree maps could be further used as a basis for plant and animal

  Biological Physics",,,,"q-bio.QM nlin.CG nlin.PS physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  To celebrate Hans Frauenfelder's achievements, we examine energy(-like)
""landscapes"" for complex living systems. Energy landscapes summarize all
possible dynamics of some physical systems. Energy(-like) landscapes can
explain some biomolecular processes, including gene expression and, as
Frauenfelder showed, protein folding. But energy-like landscapes and existing
frameworks like statistical mechanics seem impractical for describing many
living systems. Difficulties stem from living systems being high dimensional,
nonlinear, and governed by many, tightly coupled constituents that are noisy.
The predominant modeling approach is devising differential equations that are
tailored to each living system. This ad hoc approach faces the notorious
""parameter problem"": models have numerous nonlinear, mathematical functions
with unknown parameter values, even for describing just a few intracellular
processes. One cannot measure many intracellular parameters or can only measure
them as snapshots in time. Another modeling approach uses cellular automata to
represent living systems as discrete dynamical systems with binary variables.
Quantitative (Hamiltonian-based) rules can dictate cellular automata (e.g.,
Cellular Potts Model). But numerous biological features, in current practice,
are qualitatively described rather than quantitatively (e.g., gene is (highly)
expressed or not (highly) expressed). Cellular automata governed by verbal
rules are useful representations for living systems and can mitigate the
parameter problem. However, they can yield complex dynamics that are difficult
to understand because much of the existing mathematical tools and theorems
apply to continuous but not discrete dynamical systems. Recent studies found
ways to overcome this challenge by discovering a predictive ""landscape"" that
yield low-dimensional representations of cellular automata dynamics. We review
these studies.

state-of-the-art results for semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, even modern
architectures lack the ability to generalize well to a test dataset that
originates from a different domain. To avoid the costly annotation of training
data for unseen domains, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to
provide efficient knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an
unlabeled target domain. Previous work has mainly focused on minimizing the
discrepancy between the two domains by using adversarial training or
self-training. While adversarial training may fail to align the correct
semantic categories as it minimizes the discrepancy between the global
distributions, self-training raises the question of how to provide reliable
pseudo-labels. To align the correct semantic categories across domains, we
propose a contrastive learning approach that adapts category-wise centroids
across domains. Furthermore, we extend our method with self-training, where we
use a memory-efficient temporal ensemble to generate consistent and reliable
pseudo-labels. Although both contrastive learning and self-training (CLST)
through temporal ensembling enable knowledge transfer between two domains, it
is their combination that leads to a symbiotic structure. We validate our
approach on two domain adaptation benchmarks: GTA5 $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes and
SYNTHIA $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes. Our method achieves better or comparable
results than the state-of-the-art. We will make the code publicly available.

synchronization error correction. The higher the minimum insdel distance, the
more insdel errors the code can correct. Haeupler and Shahrasbi established the
Singleton bound for insdel codes: the minimum insdel distance of any $[n,k]$
linear code over $\mathbb{F}_q$ satisfies $d\leq2n-2k+2.$ There have been some
constructions of insdel codes through Reed-Solomon codes with high
capabilities, but none has come close to this bound. Recently, Do Duc {\it et
al.} showed that the minimum insdel distance of any $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon code
is no more than $2n-2k$ if $q$ is large enough compared to the code length $n$;
optimal codes that meet the new bound were also constructed explicitly. The
contribution of this paper is twofold. We first show that the minimum insdel
distance of any $[n,k]$ linear code over $\mathbb{F}_q$ satisfies $d\leq2n-2k$
if $n>k>1$. This result improves and generalizes the previously known results
in the literature. We then give a sufficient condition under which the minimum
insdel distance of a two-dimensional Reed-Solomon code of length $n$ over
$\mathbb{F}_q$ is exactly equal to $2n-4$. As a consequence, we show that the
sufficient condition is not hard to achieve; we explicitly construct an
infinite family of optimal two-dimensional Reed-Somolom codes meeting the
bound.

the question of why axion detection is difficult, even though there is enough
power in each square meter of incident dark-matter flux to energize a LED light
bulb. By quantifying backreaction on the axion field, we show that a small
axion-photon coupling does not by itself prevent an order-unity fraction of the
dark matter from being absorbed through optimal impedance match. We further
show, in contrast, that the electromagnetic charges and the self-impedance of
their coupling to photons provide the principal constraint on power absorption
integrated across a search band. Using the equations of axion electrodynamics,
we demonstrate stringent limitations on absorbed power in linear,
time-invariant, passive receivers. Our results yield fundamental constraints,
arising from the photon-electron interaction, on improving integrated power
absorption beyond the cavity haloscope technique. The analysis also has
significant practical implications, showing apparent tension with the
sensitivity projections for a number of planned axion searches. We additionally
provide a basis for more accurate signal power calculations and calibration
models, especially for receivers using multi-wavelength open configurations
such as dish antennas and dielectric haloscopes.

non-linearity. In this setting, we explore a recent adaptive sequential Monte
Carlo (ASMC) approach that builds on Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS); a
method that provides both the posterior probability density function (PDF) and
the evidence (a central quantity for Bayesian model selection) through a
particle approximation. Both techniques are well suited to parallel computation
and rely on importance sampling over a sequence of intermediate distributions,
linking the prior and the posterior PDF. Each subsequent distribution is
approximated by updating the particle weights and states, compared with the
previous approximation, using a small pre-defined number of Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) proposal steps. Compared with AIS, the ASMC method adaptively
tunes the tempering between neighboring distributions and performs resampling
of particles when the variance of the particle weights becomes too large. We
evaluate ASMC using two different conceptual models and associated synthetic
cross-hole ground penetrating radar (GPR) tomography data. For the most
challenging test case, we find that the ASMC method is faster and more reliable
in locating the posterior PDF than state-of-the-art adaptive MCMC. The evidence
estimates are found to be robust with respect to the choice of ASMC algorithmic
variables and much less sensitive to the model proposal type than MCMC.[...]

leverage the ability of stereo cameras to provide both visual and depth
information, guiding the search and validation of loop closures from a
multi-modal perspective. We propose to augment submaps that are created by
aggregating stereo point clouds, with visual keyframes. Point clouds matches
are found by comparing CSHOT descriptors and validated by clustering, while
visual matches are established by comparing keyframes using Bag-of-Words (BoW)
and ORB descriptors. The relative transformations resulting from both keyframe
and point cloud matches are then fused to provide pose constraints between
submaps in our graph-based SLAM framework. Using the LRU rover, we performed
several tests in both an indoor laboratory environment as well as a challenging
planetary analog environment on Mount Etna, Italy. These environments consist
of areas where either keyframes or point clouds alone failed to provide
adequate matches demonstrating the benefit of the proposed multi-modal
approach.

few edges is a fundamental problem in computer science with a wide range of
applications. In particular, the problem is a building block in applications
that require parallel processing. While the amount of available cores in
parallel architectures has significantly increased in recent years,
state-of-the-art graph partitioning algorithms do not work well if the input
needs to be partitioned into a large number of blocks. Often currently
available algorithms compute highly imbalanced solutions, solutions of low
quality, or have excessive running time for this case. This is because most
high-quality general-purpose graph partitioners are multilevel algorithms which
perform graph coarsening to build a hierarchy of graphs, initial partitioning
to compute an initial solution, and local improvement to improve the solution
throughout the hierarchy. However, for large number of blocks, the smallest
graph in the hierarchy that is used for initial partitioning still has to be
large.
  In this work, we substantially mitigate these problems by introducing deep
multilevel graph partitioning and a shared-memory implementation thereof. Our
scheme continues the multilevel approach deep into initial partitioning --
integrating it into a framework where recursive bipartitioning and direct k-way
partitioning are combined such that they can operate with high performance and
quality. Our approach is stronger, more flexible, arguably more elegant, and
reduces bottlenecks for parallelization compared to other multilevel
approaches. For example, for large number of blocks our algorithm is on average
an order of magnitude faster than competing algorithms while computing balanced
partitions with comparable solution quality. For small number of blocks, our
algorithms are the fastest among competing systems with comparable quality.

simulations, it is good practice to evaluate the models for their capacity to
reproduce the data. This can be done by means of Visual Predictive Checks
(VPC), which consist of (1) several reproductions of the original study by
simulation from the model under evaluation, (2) calculating estimates of
interest for each simulated study and (3) comparing the distribution of those
estimates with the estimate from the original study. This procedure is a
generic method that is straightforward to apply, in general. Here we consider
the application of the method to time to event data and consider the special
case when a time-varying covariate is not known or cannot be approximated after
event time. In this case, simulations cannot be conducted beyond the end of the
follow-up time (event or censoring time) in the original study. Thus, the
simulations must be censored at the end of the follow-up time. Since this
censoring is not random, the standard KM estimates from the simulated studies
and the resulting VPC will be biased. We propose to use inverse probability of
censoring weighting (IPoC) method to correct the KM estimator for the simulated
studies and obtain unbiased VPCs. For analyzing the Cantos study, the IPoC
weighting as described here proved valuable and enabled the generation of VPCs
to qualify PKPD models for simulations. Here, we use a generated data set,
which allows illustration of the different situations and evaluation against
the known truth.

temperature, which accelerates the aging, challenging the reliable operation of
neuromorphic systems. Existing reliability-oriented techniques periodically
de-stress all neuron and synapse circuits in the hardware at fixed intervals,
assuming worst-case operating conditions, without actually tracking their aging

which introduces latency in spike generation and propagation, impacting the
inter-spike interval and hence, performance, e.g., accuracy. We propose a new

de-stresses these circuits only when it is absolutely necessary to do so,

organs and anatomical structures in medical images. While previous work has
mainly focused on parametric spatial transformations applied on reference
template shapes, in this paper, we address the Bayesian inference of parametric
shape models for segmenting medical images with the objective to provide
interpretable results. The proposed framework defines a likelihood appearance
probability and a prior label probability based on a generic shape function
through a logistic function. A reference length parameter defined in the
sigmoid controls the trade-off between shape and appearance information. The
inference of shape parameters is performed within an Expectation-Maximisation
approach where a Gauss-Newton optimization stage allows to provide an
approximation of the posterior probability of shape parameters. This framework
is applied to the segmentation of cochlea structures from clinical CT images
constrained by a 10 parameter shape model. It is evaluated on three different
datasets, one of which includes more than 200 patient images. The results show
performances comparable to supervised methods and better than previously
proposed unsupervised ones. It also enables an analysis of parameter
distributions and the quantification of segmentation uncertainty including the
effect of the shape model.

applications. Fully exploring the information of each view is significant for
making data more representative. However, due to various limitations and
failures in data collection and pre-processing, it is inevitable for real data
to suffer from view missing and data scarcity. The coexistence of these two
issues makes it more challenging to achieve the pattern classification task.
Currently, to our best knowledge, few appropriate methods can well-handle these
two issues simultaneously. Aiming to draw more attention from the community to
this challenge, we propose a new task in this paper, called few-shot partial
multi-view learning, which focuses on overcoming the negative impact of the
view-missing issue in the low-data regime. The challenges of this task are
twofold: (i) it is difficult to overcome the impact of data scarcity under the
interference of missing views; (ii) the limited number of data exacerbates
information scarcity, thus making it harder to address the view-missing issue
in turn. To address these challenges, we propose a new unified Gaussian
dense-anchoring method. The unified dense anchors are learned for the limited
partial multi-view data, thereby anchoring them into a unified dense
representation space where the influence of data scarcity and view missing can
be alleviated. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method. The
results on Cub-googlenet-doc2vec, Handwritten, Caltech102, Scene15, Animal,
ORL, tieredImagenet, and Birds-200-2011 datasets validate its effectiveness.

simple parametric models. In particular, man-made environments commonly consist
of volumetric primitives such as cuboids or cylinders. Inferring these
primitives is an important step to attain high-level, abstract scene
descriptions. Previous approaches directly estimate shape parameters from a 2D
or 3D input, and are only able to reproduce simple objects, yet unable to
accurately parse more complex 3D scenes. In contrast, we propose a robust
estimator for primitive fitting, which can meaningfully abstract real-world
environments using cuboids. A RANSAC estimator guided by a neural network fits
these primitives to 3D features, such as a depth map. We condition the network
on previously detected parts of the scene, thus parsing it one-by-one. To
obtain 3D features from a single RGB image, we additionally optimise a feature
extraction CNN in an end-to-end manner. However, naively minimising
point-to-primitive distances leads to large or spurious cuboids occluding parts
of the scene behind. We thus propose an occlusion-aware distance metric
correctly handling opaque scenes. The proposed algorithm does not require
labour-intensive labels, such as cuboid annotations, for training. Results on
the challenging NYU Depth v2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
successfully abstracts cluttered real-world 3D scene layouts.

received considerable attention in recent years due to its technological

Here we show that in V/MgO/Fe(001) epitaxial junctions with competing in-plane
and out-of-plane (OOP) magnetic anisotropies, the SOC mediated interaction
between a ferromagnet (FM) and a superconductor (SC) enhances the effective PMA
below the superconducting transition. This produces a partial magnetization
reorientation without any applied field for all but the largest junctions,
where the IP anisotropy is more robust; for the smallest junctions there is a
reduction of the field required to induce a complete OOP transition
($H_\text{OOP}$) due to the stronger competition between the IP and OOP
anisotropies. Our results suggest that the degree of effective PMA could be
controlled by the junction lateral size in the presence of superconductivity
and an applied electric field. We also discuss how the $H_\text{OOP}$ field
could be affected by the interaction between magnetic stray fields and
superconducting vortices. Our experimental findings, supported by numerical
modelling of the ferromagnet-superconductor interaction, open pathways to
active control of magnetic anisotropy in the emerging dissipation-free

Towards that end, we present low-complexity SER based on undercomplete- and

learning. Despite its simplicity, elucidating its efficacy remains challenging.
Conventionally, the success of SGD is ascribed to the stochastic gradient noise

frequently treated and analyzed as the Euler-Maruyama discretization of
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by either Brownian or Levy
stable motion. In this study, we argue that SGN is neither Gaussian nor Levy
stable. Instead, inspired by the short-range correlation emerging in the SGN
series, we propose that SGD can be viewed as a discretization of an SDE driven
by fractional Brownian motion (FBM). Accordingly, the different convergence
behavior of SGD dynamics is well-grounded. Moreover, the first passage time of
an SDE driven by FBM is approximately derived. The result suggests a lower
escaping rate for a larger Hurst parameter, and thus SGD stays longer in flat
minima. This happens to coincide with the well-known phenomenon that SGD favors
flat minima that generalize well. Extensive experiments are conducted to
validate our conjecture, and it is demonstrated that short-range memory effects
persist across various model architectures, datasets, and training strategies.
Our study opens up a new perspective and may contribute to a better

the combination of the catalytic activity of the enzymes and a chemotactic
response to gradients of their substrate, which leads to a substrate-mediated
effective interaction between enzymes. These interactions constitute a purely
non-equilibrium effect and show exotic features such as non-reciprocity. Here,
we analytically study a model describing the phase separation of a mixture of
such catalytically-active particles. We show that a Michaelis-Menten-like
dependence of the particles' activities manifests itself as a screening of the
interactions, and that a mixture of two differently-sized active species can
exhibit phase separation with transient oscillations. We also derive a rich
stability phase diagram for a mixture of two species with both
concentration-dependent activity and size dispersity. This work highlights the
variety of possible phase separation behaviours in mixtures of
chemically-active particles, which provides an alternative pathway to the
passive interactions more commonly associated with phase separation in cells.

topological boundary states (TBSs) on the plaquette. Such topological Wannier
cycles emerge only if the Wannier centers are enclosed by the flux-carrying

yielding uniformly valid inference for a low dimensional causal parameter when

the literature on uniformly valid causal inference and discuss the costs and
benefits of using uniformly valid inference procedures. Naive estimation
strategies based on regularisation, machine learning, or a preliminary model
selection stage for the nuisance models have finite sample distributions which
are badly approximated by their asymptotic distributions. To solve this serious
problem, estimators which converge uniformly in distribution over a class of
data generating mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. In order to
obtain uniformly valid results in high-dimensional situations, sparsity
conditions for the nuisance models need typically to be made, although a double
robustness property holds, whereby if one of the nuisance model is more sparse,
the other nuisance model is allowed to be less sparse. While uniformly valid
inference is a highly desirable property, uniformly valid procedures pay a high
price in terms of inflated variability. Our discussion of this dilemma is
illustrated by the study of a double-selection outcome regression estimator,
which we show is uniformly asymptotically unbiased, but is less variable than
uniformly valid estimators in the numerical experiments conducted.

similar ionization parameter values.
  The study demonstrated that the methods used to estimate the O/H abundance

classical notions of dependency to more general settings. In this article, we
propose and study an alternative framework that is based on optimal transport.
The transport dependency $\tau \ge 0$ applies to general Polish spaces and
intrinsically respects metric properties. For suitable ground costs,
independence is fully characterized by $\tau = 0$. Via proper normalization of
$\tau$, three transport correlations $\rho_\alpha$, $\rho_\infty$, and $\rho_*$
with values in $[0, 1]$ are defined. They attain the value $1$ if and only if
$\zeta = \varphi(\xi)$, where $\varphi$ is an $\alpha$-Lipschitz function for
$\rho_\alpha$, a measurable function for $\rho_\infty$, or a multiple of an
isometry for $\rho_*$. The transport dependency can be estimated consistently
by an empirical plug-in approach, but alternative estimators with the same
convergence rate but significantly reduced computational costs are also
proposed. Numerical results suggest that $\tau$ robustly recovers dependency
between data sets with different internal metric structures. The usage for
inferential tasks, like transport dependency based independence testing, is
illustrated on a data set from a cancer study.

to achieve a good approximation of $D$ by considering two constructions of an
approximating set. First, we consider the unit-trace $n \times n$ symmetric
matrices that are PSD when restricted to a fixed set of $k$-dimensional
subspaces in $\mathbb{RR}^n$. We prove that if this set is a good approximation
of $D$, then the number of subspaces must be at least exponentially large in
$n$ for any $k = o(n)$. % Second, we show that any set $S$ that approximates
$D$ within a constant approximation ratio must have superpolynomial
$\mathbf{S}_+^k$-extension complexity. To be more precise, if $S$ is a constant
factor approximation of $D$, then $S$ must have $\mathbf{S}_+^k$-extension
complexity at least $\exp( C \cdot \min \{ \sqrt{n}, n/k \})$ where $C$ is some
absolute constant. In addition, we show that any set $S$ such that $D \subseteq

Gaussian width of $D$ must have $\mathbf{S}_+^k$-extension complexity at least
$\exp( C \cdot \min \{ n^{1/3}, \sqrt{n/k} \})$. These results imply that the
cone of $n \times n$ PSD matrices cannot be approximated by a polynomial number
of $k \times k$ PSD constraints for any $k = o(n / \log^2 n)$. These results
generalize the recent work of Fawzi on the hardness of polyhedral

direct environmental impacts generated over the life cycle of the physical
devices are usually overlooked. It is implicitly assumed that their
environmental burden is negligible compared to the positive impacts they can
generate. In this paper, we present a parametric framework based on hardware
profiles to evaluate the cradle-to-gate carbon footprint of IoT edge devices.
We exploit our framework in three ways. First, we apply it on four use cases to
evaluate their respective production carbon footprint. Then, we show that the
heterogeneity inherent to IoT edge devices must be considered as the production
carbon footprint between simple and complex devices can vary by a factor of
more than 150x. Finally, we estimate the absolute carbon footprint induced by
the worldwide production of IoT edge devices through a macroscopic analysis
over a 10-year period. Results range from 22 to 562 MtCO2-eq/year in 2027
depending on the deployment scenarios. However, the truncation error
acknowledged for LCA bottom-up approaches usually lead to an undershoot of the
environmental impacts. We compared the results of our use cases with the few
reports available from Google and Apple, which suggest that our estimates could
be revised upwards by a factor around 2x to compensate for the truncation
error. Worst-case scenarios in 2027 would therefore reach more than 1000
MtCO2-eq/year. This truly stresses the necessity to consider environmental
constraints when designing and deploying IoT edge devices.

with adversarial errors. It is assumed that the model is overparameterized and

heavy-tailed feature distributions, requiring only a weak moment assumption and

  introduction; abstract truncated to fit arXiv limits",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In graph sparsification, the goal has almost always been of {global} nature:
compress a graph into a smaller subgraph ({sparsifier}) that maintains certain
features of the original graph. Algorithms can then run on the sparsifier,
which in many cases leads to improvements in the overall runtime and memory.
This paper studies sparsifiers that have bounded (maximum) degree, and are thus
{locally} sparse, aiming to improve local measures of runtime and memory. To
improve those local measures, it is important to be able to compute such
sparsifiers {locally}.
  We initiate the study of local algorithms for bounded degree sparsifiers in
unweighted sparse graphs, focusing on the problems of vertex cover, matching,
and independent set. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be a slack parameter and $\alpha \ge 1$
be a density parameter. We devise local algorithms for computing: (1) A
$(1+\epsilon)$-vertex cover sparsifier of degree $O(\alpha / \epsilon)$, for
any graph of {arboricity} $\alpha$. (2) A $(1+\epsilon)$-maximum matching
sparsifier and also a $(1+\epsilon)$-maximal matching sparsifier of degree
$O(\alpha / \epsilon)$, for any graph of arboricity $\alpha$. (3) A
$(1+\epsilon)$-independent set sparsifier of degree $O(\alpha^2 / \epsilon)$,
for any graph of average degree $\alpha$.
  Our algorithms require only a single communication round in the standard
message passing models of distributed computing, and moreover, they can be
simulated locally in a trivial way. As an immediate application we can extend
results from distributed computing and local computation algorithms that apply
to graphs of degree bounded by $d$ to graphs of arboricity $O(d / \epsilon)$ or
average degree $O(d^2 / \epsilon)$, at the expense of increasing the
approximation guarantee by a factor of $(1+\epsilon)$. In particular, we can
extend the plethora of recent local computation algorithms [...]

Artificial Intelligence (AI), where deep neural networks (DNNs) make decisions
by continuously learning a sequence of different tasks akin to human learning
processes. It is still quite primitive, with existing works focusing primarily
on avoiding (catastrophic) forgetting. However, since forgetting is inevitable
given bounded memory and unbounded task loads, 'how to reasonably forget' is a
problem continual learning must address in order to reduce the performance gap
between AIs and humans, in terms of 1) memory efficiency, 2) generalizability,
and 3) robustness when dealing with noisy data. To address this, we propose a
novel ScheMAtic memory peRsistence and Transience (SMART) framework for
continual learning with external memory that builds on recent advances in
neuroscience. The efficiency and generalizability are enhanced by a novel
long-term forgetting mechanism and schematic memory, using sparsity and
'backward positive transfer' constraints with theoretical guarantees on the
error bound. Robust enhancement is achieved using a novel short-term forgetting
mechanism inspired by background information-gated learning. Finally, an
extensive experimental analysis on both benchmark and real-world datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our model.

is a general template for constructing asymptotically linear substitution

observations are made on a discrete time-grid.
  We consider a continuous-time counting process model where intensity measures
track the monitoring of subjects, and focus on a low-dimensional target
parameter defined as the intervention-specific mean outcome at the end of
follow-up. To construct our TMLE algorithm for the given statistical estimation
problem we derive an expression for the efficient influence curve and represent
the target parameter as a functional of intensities and conditional

estimated and updated in an iterative manner according to separate targeting
steps for the involved intensities and conditional expectations.
  The resulting estimator solves the efficient influence curve equation. We
state a general efficiency theorem and describe a highly adaptive lasso

agent that was perceived as the least uncanny, and most anthropomorphic,
likable, and co-present, was the one spontaneously mimicked the least.
Moreover, they show that instructed facial mimicry negatively predicts
spontaneous facial mimicry. Further exploratory analyses revealed that
spontaneous facial mimicry appeared when participants were less certain of the

provide a set of synchronized phasor measurements with high sampling rate with
the accuracy of less than one second, for better system monitoring especially
during the outages. Since the PMUs are costly devices, system operator is not
able to install a PMU at each bus to maximize the observability of system. To
this end, determination of the number of PMUs in the system for having a 100%
observability is pivotal. In this paper, honey bee mating optimization (HBMO)

based on the ""sampled softmax"" approach, were proposed to remove this
limitation. These methods, however, have a set of disadvantages. One of them is
a problem of ""prototype obsolescence"": classifier weights (prototypes) of the
rarely sampled classes receive too scarce gradients and become outdated and
detached from the current encoder state, resulting in incorrect training
signals. This problem is especially serious in ultra-large-scale datasets. In
this paper, we propose a novel face representation learning model called
Prototype Memory, which alleviates this problem and allows training on a
dataset of any size. Prototype Memory consists of the limited-size memory
module for storing recent class prototypes and employs a set of algorithms to
update it in appropriate way. New class prototypes are generated on the fly
using exemplar embeddings in the current mini-batch. These prototypes are
enqueued to the memory and used in a role of classifier weights for softmax
classification-based training. To prevent obsolescence and keep the memory in
close connection with the encoder, prototypes are regularly refreshed, and
oldest ones are dequeued and disposed of. Prototype Memory is computationally
efficient and independent of dataset size. It can be used with various loss
functions, hard example mining algorithms and encoder architectures. We prove
the effectiveness of the proposed model by extensive experiments on popular
face recognition benchmarks.

likelihood-based training procedure. Even though INN-based models have received
far less attention in the literature than GANs, they have been shown to have
some remarkable properties absent in GANs, e.g. apparent immunity to mode
collapse. We find that our cINNs leverage these properties for image-to-image

Furthermore, we take advantage of our bidirectional cINN architecture to
explore and manipulate emergent properties of the latent space, such as
changing the image style in an intuitive way.

amplitude can have both positive and negative signs, which has no classical
counterpart as the classical probability must be positive. Consequently, one
possible way to achieve quantum speedup is to explicitly harness this feature.
Unlike a stoquastic Hamiltonian whose ground state has only positive amplitudes
(with respect to the computational basis), a non-stoquastic Hamiltonian can be
eventually stoquastic or properly non-stoquastic when its ground state has both
positive and negative amplitudes. In this paper, we describe that, for some
hard instances which are characterized by the presence of an anti-crossing (AC)
in a transverse-field quantum annealing (QA) algorithm, how to design an
appropriate XX-driver graph (without knowing the prior problem structure) with
an appropriate XX-coupler strength such that the resulting non-stoquastic QA
algorithm is proper-non-stoquastic with two bridged anti-crossings (a
double-AC) where the spectral gap between the first and second level is large
enough such that the system can be operated diabatically in polynomial time.
The speedup is exponential in the original AC-distance, which can be
sub-exponential or exponential in the system size, over the stoquastic QA
algorithm, and possibly the same order of speedup over the state-of-the-art
classical algorithms in optimization. This work is developed based on the novel
characterizations of a modified and generalized parametrization definition of
an anti-crossing in the context of quantum optimization annealing introduced in
[4].

using Monte Carlo simulations. The parameter $q$ of the generalized antinematic
(ANq) interaction is found to have a pronounced effect on the phase diagram
topology by inducing new quasi-long-range ordered phases due to competition
with the conventional AFM interaction as well as geometrical frustration. For
values of $q$ divisible by 3 the conflict between the two interactions results
in a frustrated canted AFM phase appearing at low temperatures wedged between
the AFM and ANq phases. For $q$ nondivisible by 3 with the increase of $q$ one
can observe the evolution of the phase diagram topology featuring two ($q=2$),
three ($q=4,5$) and four ($q \geq 7$) ordered phases. In addition to the two
phases previously found for $q=2$, the first new phase with solely AFM ordering
arises for $q=4$ in the limit of strong AFM coupling and higher temperatures by
separating from the phase with the coexisting AFM and ANq orderings. For $q=7$
another phase with AFM ordering but multimodal spin distribution in each
sublattice appears at intermediate temperatures. All these algebraic phases
also display standard and generalized chiral long-range orderings, which
decouple at higher temperatures in the regime of dominant ANq (AFM) interaction

we conducted a survey of those who published in the top AI/ML conferences (N =

researchers (Grace, Salvatier, Dafoe, Zhang, & Evans, 2018) and a 2018 survey
of the US public (Zhang & Dafoe, 2020). We find that AI/ML researchers place
high levels of trust in international organizations and scientific
organizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest;
moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national
militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were
overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous
weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military
applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of
respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML
institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms.
Being closer to the technology itself, AI/ML re-searchers are well placed to
highlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel attempt to
measure their attitudes has broad relevance. The findings should help to
improve how researchers, private sector executives, and policymakers think
about regulations, governance frameworks, guiding principles, and national and

Computational Physics, 305, pp.333-359] has shown great potential in predicting
complex fluids owing to the novel weighting strategy, which ensures the
high-order accuracy, the low numerical dissipation, and the sharp
shock-capturing capability. However, the applications are still restricted to
simple geometries with Cartesian or curvilinear meshes. In this work, a new
class of high-order shock-capturing TENO schemes for unstructured meshes are
proposed. Similar to the standard TENO schemes and some variants of WENO
schemes, the candidate stencils include one large stencil and several small
third-order stencils. Following a strong scale-separation procedure, a tailored
novel ENO-like stencil selection strategy is proposed such that the high-order
accuracy is restored in smooth regions by selecting the candidate
reconstruction on the large stencil while the ENO property is enforced near
discontinuities by adopting the candidate reconstruction from smooth small
stencils. The nonsmooth stencils containing genuine discontinuities are
explicitly excluded from the final reconstruction, leading to excellent
numerical stability. Different from the WENO concept, such unique sharp stencil
selection retains the low numerical dissipation without sacrificing the
shock-capturing capability. The newly proposed framework enables arbitrarily
high-order TENO reconstructions on unstructured meshes. For conceptual
verification, the TENO schemes with third- to sixth-order accuracy are
constructed. Without parameter tuning case by case, the performance of the
proposed TENO schemes is demonstrated by examining a set of benchmark cases
with broadband flow length scales.

maximally spread its own opinion and alter the average opinion that eventually
emerges. In the literature, this problem is cast as the maximization of a set
function and, leveraging on the submodular property, is solved in a greedy
manner by solving k+ separate single targeting problems. Our main contribution
is to exploit the underlying graph structure to build more refined heuristics.
As a first instance, we provide the analytical solution for the optimal
targeting problem over complete graphs. This result provides a rule to
understand whether it is convenient or not to block the opponent's influence by
targeting the same nodes. The argument is then extended to generic graphs
leading to more accurate solutions compared to a simple greedy approach. As a
second instance, by electrical analogy we provide the analytical solution of
the single targeting problem for the line graph and derive some useful
properties of the objective function for trees. Inspired by these findings, we
define a new algorithm which selects the optimal solution on trees in a much
faster way with respect to a brute-force approach and works well also over
tree-like/sparse graphs. The proposed heuristics are then compared to zero-cost
heuristics on different random generated graphs and real social networks.
Summarizing, our results suggest a scheme that tells which algorithm is more
suitable in terms of accuracy and computational complexity, based on the

of transect locations with similar community composition and investigate
changes in clustering dynamics over time. During these years, an unprecedented
sequence of extreme weather events (cyclones and coral bleaching) impacted the
58 surveyed locations. The dependence between constituent parts of a
composition presents a challenge for existing multivariate clustering
approaches. In this paper, we introduce a finite mixture of Dirichlet
distributions with group-specific parameters, where cluster memberships are
dictated by unobserved latent variables. The inference is carried in a Bayesian
framework, where MCMC strategies are outlined to sample from the posterior
model. Simulation studies are presented to illustrate the performance of the
model in a controlled setting. The application of the model to the 2012 coral
reef data reveals that clusters were spatially distributed in similar ways
across reefs which indicates a potential influence of wave exposure at the
origin of coral reef community composition. The number of clusters estimated by
the model decreased from four in 2012 to two from 2014 until 2017. Posterior
probabilities of transect allocations to the same cluster substantially
increase through time showing a potential homogenization of community
composition across the whole GBR. The Bayesian model highlights the diversity

were made from November 2020 onwards. We use our simulator to conduct an
extensive scenario analysis - we play out many plausible scenarios through
varying economic activity, reinfection levels, population compliance,
infectiveness, prevalence and lethality of the possible variant strains, and
infection spread via local trains to arrive at those that may better explain
the second wave fatality numbers. We observe and highlight that timings of peak
and valley of the fatalities in the second wave are robust to many plausible
scenarios, suggesting that they are likely to be accurate projections for
Mumbai. During the second wave, the observed fatalities were low in February
and mid-March and saw a phase change or a steep increase in the growth rate
after around late March. We conduct extensive experiments to replicate this
observed sharp convexity. This is not an easy phenomena to replicate, and we
find that explanations such as increased laxity in the population, increased
reinfections, increased intensity of infections in Mumbai transportation,
increased lethality in the virus, or a combination amongst them, generally do a
poor job of matching this pattern. We find that the most likely explanation is
presence of small amount of extremely infective variant on February 1 that
grows rapidly thereafter and becomes a dominant strain by Mid-March. From a
prescriptive view, this points to an urgent need for extensive and continuous
genome sequencing to establish existence and prevalence of different virus
strains in Mumbai and in India, as they evolve over time.

todays growth, where the Operating System (OS) and required applications are
installed on all the machines one by one. Therefore, a framework for automating

properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion ($A$+$A$)
collisions. Comparing the production of the $J/\psi$ meson in proton+proton
($p$+$p$) and $A$+$A$ collisions, namely the nuclear modification factor
($R_{\rm AA}$), provides the quantitative understanding of the QGP. Normally,
the $R_{\rm AA}$ is measured under the assumption that the quarkonium is
unpolarized. However, the recent measurements on the $J/\psi$ polarization in
the forward rapidity region in both $p$+$p$ and $A$+$A$ collisions from the LHC
experiments suggest that the $J/\psi$ meson has small but non-negligible
polarization. In this paper, we show the effects on the kinematic acceptance
from the $J/\psi$ polarization to the measurement of $R_{\rm AA}$ in the
forward rapidity region using the available data from the ALICE and LHCb
experiments and demonstrate the possible maximum effects from polarization in
the central rapidity region at the RHIC and LHC energies. The results show that
having precise measurements on the quarkonium polarization in heavy-ion
collisions is important to obtain the full picture of how heavy quarkonium
interacts with the QGP.

in solid-state materials is necessary for their applications as quantum
sensors, transducers, memories, and emitters. In this study, we demonstrate,
from first principles, how to tune these properties via the formation of defect
polaritons. Specifically, we investigate three defect types -- CHB, CB-CB, and
CB-VN -- in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The lowest-lying
electronic excitation of these systems is coupled to an optical cavity where we
explore the strong light-matter coupling regime. For all defect systems, we
show that the polaritonic splitting that shifts the absorption energy of the
lower polariton is much higher than can be expected from a Jaynes-Cummings
interaction. In addition, we find that the absorption intensity of the lower
polariton increases by several orders of magnitude, suggesting a possible route
toward overcoming phonon-limited single photon emission from defect centers.
Finally, we find that initially localized electronic transition densities can
become delocalized across the entire material under strong light-matter
coupling. These findings are a result of an effective continuum of electronic
transitions near the lowest-lying electronic transition for both pristine hBN
and hBN with defect centers that dramatically enhances the strength of the
light-matter interaction. We expect our findings to spur experimental
investigations of strong light-matter coupling between defect centers and
cavity photons for applications in quantum technologies.

a related ratio of masses and the assumed variance. The first example attempts
to reconcile this result with quantum mechanics by considering the Schrodinger

this protocol? To answer this question we look at the current vulnerabilities,
attacks, and malware leveraging IPv6.
  Our research showed that while IPv6 adoption is growing, we are years away of
a full adoption. The current global adoption is of 35\%, however there are
countries rapidly adopting IPv6, such as India with 60\% of IPv6 enabled in the
country.
  IPv6 brings new challenges for both attackers and defenders. With a larger
address space, the activity of device discovery will force attackers to devise
new techniques and tools. Defenders will also have to adapt their tools and
monitoring technology to be able to work with IPv6.
  There are currently more than 16 million devices exposed on the internet on
IPv6, however malware authors seem to be still focused mainly on IPv4. There is
to date, one malware capable of attacking IPv6 networks. This may give an edge
to defenders, who have now the opportunity to give the first step ahead of

post hoc interpretation of traditional black-box models. Among these networks,
the arguably most widespread approach is so-called prototype learning, where
similarities to learned latent prototypes serve as the basis of classifying an
unseen data point. In this work, we point to an important shortcoming of such
approaches. Namely, there is a semantic gap between similarity in latent space
and similarity in input space, which can corrupt interpretability. We design
two experiments that exemplify this issue on the so-called ProtoPNet.
Specifically, we find that this network's interpretability mechanism can be led
astray by intentionally crafted or even JPEG compression artefacts, which can

""information is physical"", i.e., to store and process information, we need a
physical body. Here we ask whether quantum information can remain without a
physical body. We answer this question in the affirmative, i.e., we argue that
quantum information can exist without a physical body in volatile form. We
introduce the notion of the volatility of quantum information and show that
indeed the conditions for it are naturally satisfied in the quantum
teleportation protocol. We argue that even if special relativity principles are
not assumed, it is possible to make quantum information volatile. We also
discuss the classical limit of the phenomenon, as well as the multiparty
scenario.

of an epidemic. The coronavirus outbreak of December 2019 has already infected
millions all over the world and continues to spread on. Just when the curve of
the outbreak had started to flatten, many countries have again started to
witness a rise in cases which is now being referred as the 2nd wave of the
pandemic. A thorough analysis of time-series forecasting models is therefore
required to equip state authorities and health officials with immediate
strategies for future times. This aims of the study are three-fold: (a) To
model the overall trend of the spread; (b) To generate a short-term forecast of
10 days in countries with the highest incidence of confirmed cases (USA, India
and Brazil); (c) To quantitatively determine the algorithm that is best suited
for precise modelling of the linear and non-linear features of the time series.
The comparison of forecasting models for the total cumulative cases of each
country is carried out by comparing the reported data and the predicted value,
and then ranking the algorithms (Prophet, Holt-Winters, LSTM, ARIMA, and
ARIMA-NARNN) based on their RMSE, MAE and MAPE values. The hybrid combination
of ARIMA and NARNN (Nonlinear Auto-Regression Neural Network) gave the best
result among the selected models with a reduced RMSE, which proved to be almost
35.3% better than one of the most prevalent method of time-series prediction
(ARIMA). The results demonstrated the efficacy of the hybrid implementation of
the ARIMA-NARNN model over other forecasting methods such as Prophet, Holt
Winters, LSTM, and the ARIMA model in encapsulating the linear as well as
non-linear patterns of the epidemical datasets.

the driving energy becomes singular. For this system gradient-system
convergence concepts are ineffective. We characterize the limiting behaviour in
a different way, by proving $\Gamma$-convergence of the so-called
energy-dissipation functional, which combines the gradient-system components of
energy and dissipation in a single functional. The $\Gamma$-limit of these
functionals again characterizes a variational evolution, but this limit
functional is not the energy-dissipation functional of any gradient system.
  The system in question describes the diffusion of a particle in a
one-dimensional double-well energy landscape, in the limit of small noise. The
wells have different depth, and in the small-noise limit the process converges
to a Markov process on a two-state system, in which jumps only happen from the
higher to the lower well.
  This transmutation of a gradient system into a variational evolution of
non-gradient type is a model for how many one-directional chemical reactions
emerge as limit of reversible ones. The $\Gamma$-convergence proved in this
paper both identifies the `fate' of the gradient system for these reactions and
the variational structure of the limiting irreversible reactions.

applications determined by different molecular structures. It is essential to
represent these structures clearly and explore the full space of achievable
chemical designs. However, existing approaches are unable to offer
comprehensive design models for polymers because of their inherent scale and
structural complexity. Here, we present a parametric, context-sensitive grammar
designed specifically for the representation and generation of polymers. As a
demonstrative example, we implement our grammar for polyurethanes. Using our
symbolic hypergraph representation and 14 simple production rules, our
PolyGrammar is able to represent and generate all valid polyurethane
structures. We also present an algorithm to translate any polyurethane
structure from the popular SMILES string format into our PolyGrammar
representation. We test the representative power of PolyGrammar by translating
a dataset of over 600 polyurethane samples collected from literature.
Furthermore, we show that PolyGrammar can be easily extended to the other
copolymers and homopolymers such as polyacrylates. By offering a complete,
explicit representation scheme and an explainable generative model with
validity guarantees, our PolyGrammar takes an important step toward a more
comprehensive and practical system for polymer discovery and exploration. As
the first bridge between formal languages and chemistry, PolyGrammar also
serves as a critical blueprint to inform the design of similar grammars for
other chemistries, including organic and inorganic molecules.
