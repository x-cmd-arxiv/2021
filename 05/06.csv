observed developers by watching professional developers at work in
live-streamed programming sessions. Using this data source, we curated 15

systematically coded the debugging episodes and activities that occurred within
these videos, yielding a dataset of 2137 debugging activities and 1407

programming work, occurring once every eight minutes. Debugging episodes vary
greatly in time, with most being less than a few minutes and a few as more than
100 minutes. However, most debugging time is spent in long debugging episodes.
We found no single activity that dominated debugging time, and long debugging
episodes often involved many diverse activities. Finally, we found that,in
terms of the activities developers did, programming and debugging were
remarkably similar, particularly in the frequency of editing and browsing code.

class in computer vision and graphics applications. In this work, we focus on
deep 3D morphable models that directly apply deep learning on 3D mesh data with
a hierarchical structure to capture information at multiple scales. While great
efforts have been made to design the convolution operator, how to best
aggregate vertex features across hierarchical levels deserves further
attention. In contrast to resorting to mesh decimation, we propose an attention
based module to learn mapping matrices for better feature aggregation across
hierarchical levels. Specifically, the mapping matrices are generated by a
compatibility function of the keys and queries. The keys and queries are
trainable variables, learned by optimizing the target objective, and shared by
all data samples of the same object class. Our proposed module can be used as a
train-only drop-in replacement for the feature aggregation in existing
architectures for both downsampling and upsampling. Our experiments show that
through the end-to-end training of the mapping matrices, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on a variety of 3D shape datasets in comparison to
existing morphable models.

for real-world applications. This work addresses this issue by introducing an
anchor-box free and single-shot instance segmentation framework, termed
PolarMask, which reformulates the instance segmentation problem as predicting
the contours of objects in the polar coordinate, with several appealing
benefits. (1) The polar representation unifies instance segmentation (masks)
and object detection (bounding boxes) into a single framework, reducing the
design and computational complexity. (2) Two modules are carefully designed
(i.e. soft polar centerness and polar IoU loss) to sample high-quality center
examples and optimize polar contour regression, making the performance of
PolarMask does not depend on the bounding box prediction results and thus
becomes more efficient in training. (3) PolarMask is fully convolutional and
can be easily embedded into most off-the-shelf detection methods. To further
improve the accuracy of the framework, a Refined Feature Pyramid is introduced
to further improve the feature representation at different scales, termed
PolarMask++. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both
PolarMask and PolarMask++, which achieve competitive results on instance
segmentation in the challenging COCO dataset with single-model and single-scale
training and testing, as well as new state-of-the-art results on rotate text
detection and cell segmentation. We hope the proposed polar representation can
provide a new perspective for designing algorithms to solve single-shot
instance segmentation. The codes and models are available at:

paradigm attuned to machine driven data transfers in
\textit{Internet-of-Things} (IoT) networks. In a typical URA setting, a small
subset of active devices within a very large population wish to transmit short
messages to a central base station. Originally defined for base stations
equipped with a single antenna, the URA paradigm has recently been extended to
practical scenarios involving base stations with a massive number of antennas
by Fengler et al. The proposed concatenated coding scheme therein utilizes a
non-Bayesian sparse recovery algorithm coupled with the tree code introduced by
Amalladinne et al. in the context of coded compressed sensing. Currently, the
existing MIMO implementation uses these two components in isolation. This
article introduces an enhanced successive cancellation list decoding style
scheme that facilitates dynamic interactions between the sparse recovery
algorithm and the tree decoder. This modification can reduce the search space
of the AD algorithm drastically; and it results in significant improvements
both in terms of error performance and computational complexity. Simulation
results reveal that, for a system with 100 active users, the proposed decoder
reduces the number of required antennas at the base station by 23\% to achieve
a performance akin to the scheme by Fengler et al.

  Delineation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supervised methods for object delineation in remote sensing require labeled
ground-truth data. Gathering sufficient high quality ground-truth data is
difficult, especially when targets are of irregular shape or difficult to
distinguish from background or neighboring objects. Tree crown delineation
provides key information from remote sensing images for forestry, ecology, and
management. However, tree crowns in remote sensing imagery are often difficult
to label and annotate due to irregular shape, overlapping canopies, shadowing,
and indistinct edges. There are also multiple approaches to annotation in this
field (e.g., rectangular boxes vs. convex polygons) that further contribute to
annotation imprecision. However, current evaluation methods do not account for
this uncertainty in annotations, and quantitative metrics for evaluation can
vary across multiple annotators. In this paper, we address these limitations by
developing an adaptation of the Rand index for weakly-labeled crown delineation
that we call RandCrowns. Our new RandCrowns evaluation metric provides a method
to appropriately evaluate delineated tree crowns while taking into account
imprecision in the ground-truth delineations. The RandCrowns metric
reformulates the Rand index by adjusting the areas over which each term of the
index is computed to account for uncertain and imprecise object delineation
labels. Quantitative comparisons to the commonly used intersection over union
method shows a decrease in the variance generated by differences among multiple
annotators. Combined with qualitative examples, our results suggest that the
RandCrowns metric is more robust for scoring target delineations in the
presence of uncertainty and imprecision in annotations that are inherent to
tree crown delineation.

unique tests of general relativity in the dynamical and non-linear regimes. One
of the most important such tests are constraints on the post-Newtonian (PN)
corrections to the phase of the gravitational wave signal. The values of these
PN coefficients can be calculated within standard general relativity, and these
values are different in many alternate theories of gravity. It is clearly of
great interest to constrain these deviations based on gravitational wave
observations. In the majority of such tests which have been carried out, and
which yield by far the most stringent constraints, it is common to vary these
PN coefficients individually. While this might in principle be useful for
detecting certain deviations from standard general relativity, it is a serious
limitation. For example, we would expect alternate theories of gravity to
generically have additional parameters. The corrections to the PN coefficients
would be expected to depend on these additional non-GR parameters whence, we
expect that the various PN coefficients to be highly correlated. We present an
alternate analysis here using data from the binary neutron star coalescence
GW170817. Our analysis uses an appropriate linear combination of non-GR
parameters that represent absolute deviations from the corresponding
post-Newtonian inspiral coefficients in the TaylorF2 approximant phase. These
combinations represent uncorrelated non-GR parameters which correspond to
principal directions of their covariance matrix in the parameter subspace. Our
results illustrate good agreement with GR. In particular, the integral non-GR
phase is $\Psi_{\mbox{non-GR}} = (0.447\pm253)\times10^{-1}$ and the deviation

geometry (camera and depth), moving objects, and their motions, with no
supervision. We build on the idea of view synthesis, which uses classical
camera geometry to re-render a source image from a different point-of-view,
specified by a predicted relative pose and depth map. By minimizing the error
between the synthetic image and the corresponding real image in a video, the
deep network that predicts pose and depth can be trained completely
unsupervised. However, the view synthesis equations rely on a strong
assumption: that objects do not move. This rigid-world assumption limits the
predictive power, and rules out learning about objects automatically. We
propose a simple solution: minimize the error on small regions of the image
instead. While the scene as a whole may be non-rigid, it is always possible to
find small regions that are approximately rigid, such as inside a moving
object. Our network can then predict different poses for each region, in a
sliding window from a learned dense pose map. This represents a significantly
richer model, including 6D object motions, with little additional complexity.
We achieve very competitive performance on unsupervised odometry and depth
prediction on KITTI. We also demonstrate new capabilities on EPIC-Kitchens, a
challenging dataset of indoor videos, where there is no ground truth

modal transformations in Hermitian elastic lattices. When this is combined with
a proper excitation mechanism, it allows to drive the energy transfer across
the lattice with tunable propagation rates. Such a modal transformation,
however, is limited by the adiabaticity of the process, which dictates an upper
bound for the modulation speed. In this manuscript, we employ a non-Hermitian
shortcut by way of a tailored gain and loss to violate the adiabatic limit and,
therefore, to achieve superfast modal transformations. A quantitative condition
for adiabaticity is firstly derived and numerically verified for a pair of
weakly coupled time-dependent mechanical oscillators, which can be interpreted
in the light of modal interaction between crossing states. It is shown that for
sufficiently slow time-modulation, the elastic energy can be transferred from
one oscillator to the other. A non-Hermitian shortcut is later induced to break
the modal coupling and, therefore, to speed-up the modal transformation. The
strategy is then generalized to elastic lattices supporting topological edge
states. We show that the requirements for a complete edge-to-edge energy
transfer are lifted from the adiabatic limit toward higher modulation
velocities, opening up new opportunities in the context of wave manipulation
and control.

lead to convergent error dynamics and characterize delicate relationships among
sampling periods, topologies, and system matrices. An event-triggering
mechanism based on locally sampled data is designed to regulate the
communication among agents, and the convergence of the estimation errors under
the mechanism holds for a class of positive and convergent triggering
functions, which include the commonly used exponential function as a special
case. The mixed time- and event-triggered architecture naturally excludes the
existence of Zeno behavior as the system updates at discrete instants. When the
triggering function is bounded by exponential functions, analytical
characterization of the relationship among sampling, event triggering, and

input image with arbitrary hole regions, PD-GAN produces multiple inpainting
results with diverse and visually realistic content. Our PD-GAN is built upon a
vanilla GAN which generates images based on random noise. During image
generation, we modulate deep features of input random noise from coarse-to-fine
by injecting an initially restored image and the hole regions in multiple
scales. We argue that during hole filling, the pixels near the hole boundary
should be more deterministic (i.e., with higher probability trusting the
context and initially restored image to create natural inpainting boundary),
while those pixels lie in the center of the hole should enjoy more degrees of
freedom (i.e., more likely to depend on the random noise for enhancing
diversity). To this end, we propose spatially probabilistic diversity
normalization (SPDNorm) inside the modulation to model the probability of
generating a pixel conditioned on the context information. SPDNorm dynamically
balances the realism and diversity inside the hole region, making the generated
content more diverse towards the hole center and resemble neighboring image
content more towards the hole boundary. Meanwhile, we propose a perceptual
diversity loss to further empower PD-GAN for diverse content generation.
Experiments on benchmark datasets including CelebA-HQ, Places2 and Paris Street
View indicate that PD-GAN is effective for diverse and visually realistic image
restoration.

used manifold learning to build a three-dimensional parameterization of the
intrinsic diversity of SNe Ia at maximum light that we call the ""Twins
Embedding"". In this article, we discuss how the Twins Embedding can be used to
improve the standardization of SNe Ia. With a single
spectrophotometrically-calibrated spectrum near maximum light, we can
standardize our sample of SNe Ia with an RMS of $0.101 \pm 0.007$ mag, which
corresponds to $0.084 \pm 0.009$ mag if peculiar velocity contributions are
removed and $0.073 \pm 0.008$ mag if a larger reference sample were obtained.
Our techniques can standardize the full range of SNe Ia, including those
typically labeled as peculiar and often rejected from other analyses. We find
that traditional light curve width + color standardization such as SALT2 is not
sufficient. The Twins Embedding identifies a subset of SNe Ia including but not
limited to 91T-like SNe Ia whose SALT2 distance estimates are biased by $0.229
\pm 0.045$ mag. Standardization using the Twins Embedding also significantly
decreases host-galaxy correlations. We recover a host mass step of $0.040 \pm
0.020$ mag compared to $0.092 \pm 0.024$ mag for SALT2 standardization on the
same sample of SNe Ia. These biases in traditional standardization methods
could significantly impact future cosmology analyses if not properly taken into
account.

respectively. We focus on the effects of the interaction parameter between the
A/B monomers $\tau$, and the polymer/solvent $\chi$, as well as the NP size on
the nanoparticle shape and internal morphology. The aspect ratio ($l_{\rm AR}$)
defined as the length ratio between the long and short axes is used to
characterize the overall NP shape. Our results show that for the solvent that
is neutral towards the two blocks, as $\tau$ increases, the $l_{\rm AR}$ of the
NP first increases and then decreases, indicating that the NP becomes more
elongated and then changes to a spherical NP. Likewise, decreasing $\chi$ or
increasing the NP size can result in a more elongated NP. However, when the
solvent has a preference towards the A or B blocks, the NP shape changes from
striped ellipsoid to onion-like sphere by increasing the A/B preference
parameter strength. The critical condition of the transition from an L$_\perp$

fill an important gap in observations for bright ACV variables between the

agreement with the literature; for one star, the here presented solution
represents the first published period. We discuss the apparently constant stars

deep networks have exploited training to achieve a new state of the art;
however, they may perform poorly when training is limited or does not represent
problem phenomenology, such as the addition or removal of dense shadows. We
propose a model which enriches neural networks with physical insight. More
precisely, our method generates the relighted image with new illumination
settings via two different strategies and subsequently fuses them using a
weight map (w). In the first strategy, our model predicts the material
reflectance parameters (albedo) and illumination/geometry parameters of the
scene (shading) for the relit image (we refer to this strategy as intrinsic
image decomposition (IID)). The second strategy is solely based on the black
box approach, where the model optimizes its weights based on the ground-truth
images and the loss terms in the training stage and generates the relit output
directly (we refer to this strategy as direct). While our proposed method
applies to both one-to-one and any-to-any relighting problems, for each case we
introduce problem-specific components that enrich the model performance: 1) For
one-to-one relighting we incorporate normal vectors of the surfaces in the
scene to adjust gloss and shadows accordingly in the image. 2) For any-to-any
relighting, we propose an additional multiscale block to the architecture to
enhance feature extraction. Experimental results on the VIDIT 2020 and the

submitted to a matching engine. Hawkes processes can be used to model the time
and order of events, and how these events relate to each other. However, they
provide a freedom with regards to implementation mechanics relating to the
prices and volumes of injected orders. This allows us to consider a reference
Hawkes model and two additional models which have rules that change the
behaviour of limit orders. The resulting trade and quote data from the
simulations are then calibrated and compared with the original order generating
process to determine the extent with which implementation rules can distort
model parameters. Evidence from validation and hypothesis tests suggest that
the true model specification can be significantly distorted by market
mechanics, and that practical considerations not directly due to model
specification can be important with regards to model identification within an
inherently asynchronous trading environment.

Infrared spectroscopy of star and planet forming regions is at the
dawn of a new age with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. In support of
these observations, laboratory spectra are required to identify complex organic
molecules in the ices that cover the dust grains in these regions.
  Aims. This study aims to provide reference spectra to firmly detect icy
methyl formate in the different stages of star and planet forming regions.
Methyl formate is mixed in astronomically relevant matrices, and the peak
positions, FWHMs, and relative band intensities are characterized for different
temperatures to provide an analytical tool for astronomers.
  Methods. Methyl formate is deposited at 15 K under high-vacuum conditions.
Specifically, methyl formate is deposited pure and mixed with CO, H$_2$CO,
CH$_3$OH, H$_2$O, and CO:H$_2$CO:CH$_3$OH combined. Throughout the experiment
infrared spectra are acquired with a FTIR spectrometer in the range from
4000-500 cm$^{-1}$ (2.5-20 $\mu$m) at a spectral resolution of 0.5 cm$^{-1}$.
  Results. We present the characterization of five solid-state methyl formate
vibrational modes in pure and astronomically relevant ice matrices. The five
selected vibrational modes, namely the C=O stretch, C$-$O stretch, CH$_3$
rocking, O$-$CH$_3$ stretching, and OCO deformation, are best suited for a JWST
identification of methyl formate. For each of these vibrational modes, and each
of the mixtures the TvS heatmaps, peak position versus FWHM, and relative band
intensities are given. Additionally, the acquired reference spectra of methyl
formate are compared with Spitzer observations of HH 46. A tentative detection
of methyl formate provides an upper limit to the column density of
$1.7\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to an upper limit relative to water
of $\leq 2.2\%$ and $\leq 40\%$ with respect to methanol.

evolution of binary/multiple stellar systems. Following this stage, the CE is
thought to be ejected, leaving behind a compact binary (or a merger product).
Although extensively studied, the CEE process is still little understood, and
although most binaries have non-negligible eccentricity, the effect of initial
eccentricity on the CEE has been little explored. Moreover, most studies assume
a complete circularization of the orbit by the CE onset, while observationally
such eccentricities are detected in many post-CE binaries. Here we use smoothed
particle hydro-dynamical simulations (SPH) to study the evolution of initially
eccentric ($0\le e\le0.95$) CE-systems. We find that initially eccentric
binaries only partially circularize. In addition, higher initial eccentricity
leads to a higher eccentricity following the end of the inspiral phase, with
eccentricities as high as 0.18 in the most eccentric cases, and even higher if
the initial peri-center of the orbit is located inside the star (e.g. following
a kick into an eccentric orbit, rather than a smooth transition). CEE of more
eccentric binaries leads to enhanced dynamical mass-loss of the CE compared
with more circular binaries, and depends on the initial closest approach of the
binary. We show that our results and the observed eccentricities of post-CE
binaries suggest that the typical assumptions of circular orbits following CEE
might potentially be revised. We expect post-CE eccentricities to affect the
delay time distributions of various transients such as supernovae, gamma-ray
bursts and gravitational-wave sources by up to tens of percents.

asymptotic period vectors of Calabi- Yau manifolds. Our strategy is to exploit
the constraints imposed by completeness, symmetry, and positivity, which are
formalized in asymptotic Hodge theory. We use these general principles to study
the periods near any boundary in complex structure moduli space and explain
that near most boundaries leading exponentially suppressed corrections must be
present for consistency. The only exception are period vectors near the
well-studied large complex structure point. Together with the classification of
possible boundaries, our procedure makes it possible to construct general
models for these asymptotic periods. The starting point for this construction
is the sl(2)-data classifying the boundary, which we use to construct the
asymptotic Hodge decomposition known as the nilpotent orbit. We then use the
latter to determine the asymptotic period vector. We explicitly carry out this
program for all possible one- and two-moduli boundaries in Calabi-Yau
threefolds and write down general models for their asymptotic periods.

particles by electrons bound in crystals for a general form of the underlying
DM-electron interaction. Such a description is relevant for direct-detection
experiments of DM particles lighter than a nucleon, which might be observed in
operating DM experiments via electron excitations in semiconductor crystal
detectors. Our formalism is based on an effective theory approach to general
non-relativistic DM-electron interactions, including the anapole, and magnetic
and electric dipole couplings, combined with crystal response functions defined
in terms of electron wave function overlap integrals. Our main finding is that,
for the usual simplification of the velocity integral, the rate of DM-induced
electronic transitions in a semiconductor material depends on at most five
independent crystal response functions, four of which were not known
previously. We identify these crystal responses, and evaluate them using
density functional theory for crystalline silicon and germanium, which are used
in operating DM direct detection experiments. Our calculations allow us to set
90% confidence level limits on the strength of DM-electron interactions from
data reported by the SENSEI and EDELWEISS experiments. The novel crystal
response functions discovered in this work encode properties of crystalline
solids that do not interact with conventional experimental probes, suggesting
the use of the DM wind as a probe to reveal new kinds of hidden order in
materials.

models that exhibit some form of so-called MONDian phenomenology to account for
this galactic scaling, while also recovering the success of cold dark matter on

in the field of frustrated magnetism. While a few examples of spin-liquid

the honeycomb lattice), recent investigations have suggested the possibility of
their appearance in several Heisenberg-like models on frustrated lattices. An
important related question concerns the stability of spin liquids in the

magnetoelastic interaction between spins and phonons represents a relevant and
physically motivated perturbation, which has been scarcely investigated so far.

Gutzwiller-projected wave functions implemented with a spin-phonon Jastrow
factor, providing a full quantum treatment of both spin and phonon degrees of
freedom. The results on the frustrated $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on one- and

prone to lattice distortions, a gapless spin liquid is stable for small

the atmosphere, driving the chemical composition out of equilibrium. Due to the
longer computation times associated with multi-dimensional forward models,
horizontal mixing has only been investigated for a few case studies. In this
paper, we aim to generalize the impact of horizontal and vertical mixing on the
chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres over a large parameter space. We do this by
applying a sequence of post-processed forward models for a large grid of
synchronously rotating gaseous exoplanets, where we vary the effective
temperature (between 400 K and 2600 K), surface gravity, and rotation rate. We
find that there is a dichotomy in the horizontal homogeneity of the chemical
abundances. Planets with effective temperatures below 1400 K tend to have
horizontally homogeneous, vertically quenched chemical compositions, while
planets hotter than 1400 K exhibit large compositional day-night differences
for molecules such as methane. Furthermore, we find that the planet's rotation
rate impacts the planetary climate, and thus also the molecular abundances and
transmission spectrum. By employing a hierarchical modelling approach, we
assess the relative importance of disequilibrium chemistry on the exoplanet
transmission spectrum, and conclude that the temperature has the most profound
impact. Temperature differences are also the main cause of limb asymmetries,
which we estimate could be observable with the James Webb Space Telescope. This

motions. The quality of the data and the number of available radial velocities
allowed us to detect for the first time a significant rotation signal along the

peak located at only $\sim20''$ from the cluster center, corresponding to only
$\sim10\%$ of the cluster half-light radius. This result is further supported
by the detection of a central and significant tangential anisotropy in the
cluster innermost regions. This is one of the most central rotation signals
ever observed in a globular cluster to date. We also explore the rotational
properties of the multiple populations hosted by this cluster and find that
Na-rich stars rotate about two times more rapidly than the Na-poor

closely related by circle compactification, an important subtlety arises in
this process, changing the phase structure of the 3d theory. Namely, the
effective theory obtained from the circle compactification of a phase of a 3d

decompose into several identical 2d gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) for the
same target upon reduction to 2d. To illustrate this phenomenon, we investigate

filamentary structure with a low velocity dispersion of $247\pm32$ km s$^{-1}$
at $z=2.241\pm0.001$, providing a direct confirmation of a large-scale cosmic
web in the early Universe. The galaxy overdensities $\delta_{\rm g}$ on the
scale of 15 cMpc are $22.9\pm4.9$, $10.9\pm2.5$, and $20.5\pm3.9$ for the
BOSS1244 SW, BOSS1244 NE, and BOSS1542 filament, respectively. They are the
most overdense galaxy protoclusters ($\delta_{\rm g}>20$) discovered to date at
$z>2$. These systems are expected to become virialized at $z\sim0$ with a total
mass of $M_{\rm SW}=(1.59\pm0.20)\times10^{15}$ $M_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm NE}
=(0.83\pm0.11)\times10^{15}$ $M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\rm
filament}=(1.42\pm0.18)\times10^{15}$ $M_{\odot}$, respectively. Together with
BOSS1441 described in Cai et al. (2017a), these extremely massive overdensities
at $z=2-3$ exhibit different morphologies, indicating that they are in
different assembly stages in the formation of early galaxy clusters.

different epochs spanning about 15 years. The blue-BAL component (with an
ejection velocity, $v_{\rm e}\sim37,500$ kms$^{-1}$) is an emerging absorption
that shows equivalent width variations and kinematic shifts consistent with
acceleration. The red-BAL component ($v_{\rm e} \sim 15,400$ kms$^{-1}$) is a
three component absorption. One of the components is emerging and subsequently
disappearing. The two other components show kinematic shifts consistent with
acceleration coupled with equivalent width variability. Interestingly, we find
the kinematic shifts and equivalent width variability of the blue- and red-BAL
components to be correlated. While the C IV emission line flux varies by more
than 17% during our monitoring period, the available light-curves (covering
rest frame 1300-2300 angstrom do not show more than a 0.1 mag variability in
the continuum. This suggests that the variations in the ionizing flux are
larger than that of the near-UV flux. However, the correlated variability seen
between different BAL components cannot be explained solely by photoionization
models without structural changes. In the framework of disk wind models, any
changes in the radial profiles of density and/or velocity triggered either by
disk instabilities or by changes in the ionizing radiation can explain our
observations. High resolution spectroscopic monitoring of J1621+0758 is
important to understand the physical conditions of the absorbing gas and

driving it, however, is still under debate and a final consensus on the
timescale of the process has not been reached. Does this contraction proceed
slowly, sustained by strong magnetic fields and ambipolar diffusion, or is it
driven by fast collapse with gravity dominating the entire process? One way to
answer this question is to measure the age of prestellar cores through
statistical methods based on observations or via reliable chemical
chronometers, which should better reflect the physical conditions of the cores.
Here we report APEX observations of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ and para-D$_2$H$^+$ for
six cores in the Ophiuchus complex and combine them with detailed
three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including chemistry,
providing a range of ages for the observed cores up to 200 kyr. The outcome of
our simulations and subsequent analysis provides a good match with the
observational results in terms of physical (core masses and volume densities)
and dynamical parameters such as the Mach number and the virial parameter. We
show that models of fast collapse successfully reproduce the observed range of
chemical abundance ratios as the timescales to reach the observed stages is
comparable to the dynamical time of the cores (i.e. the free-fall time) and
much shorter than the ambipolar diffusion time, measured from the electron
fraction in the simulations. To confirm that this ratio can be used to
distinguish between different star-formation scenarios a larger (statistically

the analysis of cosmological data such as large-scale structure, 21cm
observations, and weak lensing. Existing computer models (Boltzmann codes) such
as CLASS can provide it at the expense of immoderate computational cost. In
this paper, we propose a fast Bayesian method to generate the 3D matter power
spectrum, for a given set of wavenumbers, $k$ and redshifts, $z$. Our code
allows one to calculate the following quantities: the linear matter power
spectrum at a given redshift (the default is set to 0); the non-linear 3D
matter power spectrum with/without baryon feedback; the weak lensing power
spectrum. The gradient of the 3D matter power spectrum with respect to the
input cosmological parameters is also returned and this is useful for
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers. The derivatives are also useful for Fisher
matrix calculations. In our application, the emulator is accurate when
evaluated at a set of cosmological parameters, drawn from the prior, with the
fractional uncertainty, $\Delta P_{\delta}/P_{\delta}$ centred on 0. It is also
$\sim 300$ times faster compared to CLASS, hence making the emulator amenable
to sampling cosmological and nuisance parameters in a Monte Carlo routine. In
addition, once the 3D matter power spectrum is calculated, it can be used with
a specific redshift distribution, $n(z)$ to calculate the weak lensing and
intrinsic alignment power spectra, which can then be used to derive constraints
on cosmological parameters in a weak lensing data analysis problem. The
software ($\texttt{emuPK}$) can be trained with any set of points and is
distributed on Github, and comes with a pre-trained set of Gaussian Process
(GP) models, based on 1000 Latin Hypercube (LH) samples, which follow roughly

tangent method assumes that a modification of the most external path does not
affect the arctic curve. We strengthen this statement and also make it more
concrete by observing a factorization property: if $Z^{}_{n+k}$ denotes a
refined partition function of a system of $n+k$ non-crossing paths, with the
endpoints of the $k$ most external paths possibly displaced, then at dominant
order in $n$, it factorizes as $Z^{}_{n+k} \simeq Z^{}_{n} Z_k^{\rm out}$ where
$Z_k^{\rm out}$ is the contribution of the $k$ most external paths. Moreover if
the shape of the arctic curve is known, we find that the asymptotic value of
$Z_k^{\rm out}$ is fully computable in terms of the large deviation function
$L$ introduced in \cite{DGR19} (also called Lagrangean function). We present
detailed verifications of the factorization in the Aztec diamond and for
alternating sign matrices by using exact lattice results. Reversing the
argument, we reformulate the tangent method in a way that no longer requires an
extension of the domain, and which reveals the hidden role of the $L$ function.
As a by-product, the factorization property provides an efficient way to
conjecture the asymptotics of multirefined partition functions.

particle, we confirmed that the pitch angle diffusion of the particle was along
the constant Hamiltonian surface and that it was driven by the interaction with
the resonance surfaces. We also showed that oblique whistlers could efficiently
scatter field-aligned strahl electrons into the halo population in the solar
wind. We demonstrated through simulation that these waves were capable of
generating horn-like features in the velocity distribution function, similar to
recent PIC simulation results in the literature.

  Bilevel Optimization",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider non-convex stochastic bilevel optimization (SBO)
problems that have many applications in machine learning. Although numerous
studies have proposed stochastic algorithms for solving these problems, they
are limited in two perspectives: (i) their sample complexities are high, which
do not match the state-of-the-art result for non-convex stochastic
optimization; (ii) their algorithms are tailored to problems with only one
lower-level problem. When there are many lower-level problems, it could be
prohibitive to process all these lower-level problems at each iteration. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes fast randomized stochastic
algorithms for non-convex SBO problems. First, we present a stochastic method
for non-convex SBO with only one lower problem and establish its sample
complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^3)$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point
under Lipschitz continuous conditions of stochastic oracles, matching the lower
bound for stochastic smooth non-convex optimization. Second, we present a
randomized stochastic method for non-convex SBO with $m>1$ lower level problems
(multi-task SBO) by processing a constant number of lower problems at each
iteration, and establish its sample complexity no worse than $O(m/\epsilon^3)$,
which could be a better complexity than that of simply processing all $m$ lower
problems at each iteration. Lastly, we establish even faster convergence
results for gradient-dominant functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work considering multi-task SBO and developing state-of-the-art
sample complexity results.

produced by the initial disintegration event, corresponding to fragments C/2019
Y4-A and C/2019 Y4-B identified in ground-based data. These two clusters
started with similar integrated brightness, but exhibit different evolutionary
behavior. C/2019 Y4-A was much shorter-lived compared to C/2019 Y4-B, and
showed signs of significant mass-loss and changes in size distribution
throughout the 3-day campaign. The cause of the initial fragmentation is
undetermined by the limited evidence but crudely compatible with either the
spin-up disruption of the nucleus or runaway sublimation of sub-surface
supervolatile ices, either of which would lead to the release of a large amount
of gas as inferred from the significant bluing of the comet observed shortly
before the disintegration. Gas can only be produced by the sublimation of
volatile ices, which must have survived at least one perihelion passage at a
perihelion distance of $q=0.25$~au. We speculate that Comet ATLAS is derived
from the ice-rich interior of a non-uniform, kilometer-wide progenitor that
split during its previous perihelion. This suggests that comets down to a few
kilometers in diameter can still possess complex, non-uniform interiors that
can protect ices against intense solar heating.

consistent with measurements over the past decade, and, for the first time, an
RM of $(-2.1\pm0.1) \times10^5$ rad m$^{-2}$ at 3 mm, suggesting that about
half of the Faraday rotation at 1.3 mm may occur between the 3 mm photosphere
and the 1.3 mm source. We also report the first unambiguous measurement of RM
toward the M87 nucleus at mm wavelengths, which undergoes significant changes
in magnitude and sign reversals on a one year time-scale, spanning the range

two-component model, comprised of a variable compact region and a static

provide an accessible introduction to quantum embedding kernels and then
analyze the practical issues arising when realizing them on a noisy near-term

parameters. These variational parameters are optimized for a given dataset by
increasing the kernel-target alignment, a heuristic connected to the achievable
classification accuracy. We further show under which conditions noise from
device imperfections influences the predicted kernel and provide a strategy to
mitigate these detrimental effects which is tailored to quantum embedding
kernels. We also address the influence of finite sampling and derive bounds
that put guarantees on the quality of the kernel matrix. We illustrate our
findings by numerical experiments and tests on actual hardware.

additional dynamical degree of freedom and these tensions are not universal,
but rather each string generates its own tension, which can have a different
value for each string. We consider new background field that can couple to
these strings, the tension scalar is capable of changing locally along the
world sheet the value of the tension of the extended object. When many types of
strings probing the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is
constrained by the requirement of quantum conformal invariance. For the case of
two types of strings probing the same region of space with different
dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics, associated to
the different strings, that have to satisfy vacuum Einsteins equations and the
consistency of these two equation determines the tension scalar. In a previous
paper we studied solutions that completely avoid singularities, but with
positive and negative tensions strings. In this paper we will consider only
positive tension strings for the cosmological case and for warped space time .
In both of these cases there is a region where the string tensions approach
infinity, in the cosmological case this takes place in the early universe while
in the warped case, for some value of the warping coordinate and since the
Hagedorn temperature is proportional the the string tension, we get this way
string scenarios with no limiting Hagedorn temperature in the early universe
and this opens the possibility of a string cosmology without a Hgedorn phase
transition through all of its history . Similar situation can take place in a
warped space time, for this case, assuming the string have a tendency to avoid
regions with lower Hagedorn temperature, we obtain a mechanism for condensation
of strings into a surface at high temperatures.

hysteresis, wherein the level of shear stress required to trigger flow is
larger than that below which flow stops. Although such behavior is typically
modeled as a simple non-monotonic flow rule, the rheology of granular materials
is also nonlocal due to cooperativity at the grain scale, leading for instance
to increased strengthening of the flow threshold as system size is reduced. We
investigate how these two effects - hysteresis and nonlocality - couple with
each other by incorporating non-monotonicity of the flow rule into the nonlocal
granular fluidity (NGF) model, a nonlocal constitutive model for granular
flows. By artificially tuning the strength of nonlocal diffusion, we
demonstrate that both ingredients are key to explaining certain features of the
hysteretic transition between flow and arrest. Finally, we assess the ability
of the NGF model to quantitatively predict material behavior both around the
transition and in the flowing regime, through stress-driven discrete element
method (DEM) simulations of flow onset and arrest in various geometries. Along
the way, we develop a new methodology to compare deterministic model
predictions with the stochastic behavior exhibited by the DEM simulations

(the ""bubble size"") around a GRB host halo. Second, $\langle{x_{\rm

bubble around the GRB, which is approximated as spatially uniform. Finally,
$N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ denotes the column-density of a local damped Lyman-alpha
absorber (DLA) associated with the GRB host galaxy. The size distribution of
ionized regions is extracted from a numerical simulation of reionization, and
evolves strongly across the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The model DLA column
densities follow the empirical distribution determined from current GRB
afterglow spectra. We use a Fisher matrix formalism to forecast the
$\langle{x_{\rm HI}(z)\rangle}$ constraints that can be obtained from follow-up
spectroscopy of afterglows with SNR = 20 per R=3,000 resolution element at the
continuum. We find that the neutral fraction may be determined to better than
10-15\% (1-$\sigma$) accuracy from this data across multiple independent
redshift bins at $z \sim 6-10$, spanning much of the EoR, although the
precision degrades somewhat near the end of reionization. A more futuristic
survey with $80$ GRB afterglows at $z \geq 6$ can improve the precision here by
a factor of $2$ and extend measurements out to $z \sim 14$. We further discuss
how these constraints may be combined with estimates of the escape fraction of
ionizing photons, derived from the DLA column density distribution towards GRBs

from waveforms in the same BMS frame. Up until now, however, the BMS frame of
numerical waveforms has not been thoroughly examined, largely because the
necessary tools have not existed. In this paper, we show how to analyze and map
to a suitable BMS frame for numerical waveforms calculated with the Spectral
Einstein Code (SpEC). However, the methods and tools that we present are
general and can be applied to any numerical waveforms. We present an extensive
study of 13 binary black hole systems that broadly span parameter space. From
these simulations, we extract the strain and also the Weyl scalars using both
SpECTRE's Cauchy-characteristic extraction module and also the standard
extrapolation procedure with a displacement memory correction applied during
postprocessing. First, we show that the current center-of-mass correction used
to map these waveforms to the center-of-mass frame is not as effective as
previously thought. Consequently, we also develop an improved correction that
utilizes asymptotic Poincar\'e charges instead of a Newtonian center-of-mass
trajectory. Next, we map our waveforms to the post-Newtonian (PN) BMS frame
using a PN strain waveform. This helps us find the unique BMS transformation
that minimizes the $L^{2}$ norm of the difference between the numerical and PN
strain waveforms during the early inspiral phase. We find that once the
waveforms are mapped to the PN BMS frame, they can be hybridized with a PN
strain waveform much more effectively than if one used any of the previous
alignment schemes, which only utilize the Poincar\'e transformations.

general relativity and quantum theory to a theory of quantum gravity. An aspect
that might become relevant in such a theory is that the dynamical nature of
causal structure present in general relativity displays quantum uncertainty.
This may lead to a phenomenon known as indefinite or quantum causal structure,
as captured by the process matrix formalism. Due to the generality of that
framework, however, for many process matrices there is no clear physical
interpretation. A popular approach towards a quantum theory of gravity is the
Page-Wootters formalism, which associates to time a Hilbert space structure
similar to spatial position. By explicitly introducing a quantum clock, it
allows to describe time-evolution of systems via correlations between this
clock and said systems encoded in history states. In this paper we combine the
process matrix framework with a generalization of the Page-Wootters formalism
in which one considers several agents, each with their own discrete quantum
clock. We describe how to extract process matrices from scenarios involving
such agents with quantum clocks, and analyze their properties. The description
via a history state with multiple clocks imposes constraints on the
implementation of process matrices and on the perspectives of the agents as
described via causal reference frames. While it allows for scenarios where
different definite causal orders are coherently controlled, we explain why

applications as a structural material and as a neutron absorber. The large
solubility range of carbon in boron, between $\approx$ 9% and 20%, stems from
the thermodynamical stability of three icosahedral phases at low temperature,
with respective carbon atomic concentrations: 8.7% (B$_{10.5}$C, named
OPO$_1$), 13.0 \% (B$_{6.7}$C, named OPO$_2$), whose theoretical Raman spectra
are still unknown, and 20% (B$_4$C), from which the nature of some of the Raman
peaks are still debated. We report theoretical and experimental results of the
first order, non-resonant, Raman spectrum of boron carbide. Density functional
perturbation theory enables us to obtain the Raman spectra of the OPO$_1$ and
OPO$_2$ phases, which are perfectly ordered structures with a complex
crystalline motif of 414 atoms, due to charge compensation effects. Moreover,
for the carbon-rich B$_4$C, with a simpler 15-atom unit cell, we study the
influence of the low energy point defects and of their concentrations on the
Raman spectrum, in connection with experiments, thus providing insights into
the sensitivity of experime ntal spectra to sample preparation, experimental
conditions and setup. In particular, this enables us to propose a new structure
at 19.2% atomic carbon concentration, B$_{4.2}$C, that lies very close to the
convex hull of boron carbide, on the carbon-rich side. This new phase, derived
from what we name the ""3+1"" defect complex, helps in reconciling the
experimentally observed Raman spectrum with the theory around 1000 cm$^{-1}$.
Finally, we predict the intensity variations induced by the experimental
geometry and quantitavely assess the localisation of bulk and defect
vibrational modes and their character, with an analysis of ""chain"" and

motion with $H>1/2$, and the jump properties of the BN-S model. We find

protocol for the phase accumulation time in low-fidelity Ramsey measurements,
and performance is compared to both a previously reported adaptive heuristic
protocol and random setting choices. A workflow allowing measurements and
design calculations to run concurrently largely eliminates computation time

three-body problem with arbitrary viscosities, in which all the masses are
considered to be extended and all the tidal interactions between pairs are
taken into account. Based on the creep tide theory, we present the set of
differential equations that describes the rotational evolution of each body, in
a formalism that is easily extensible to the N tidally-interacting body
problem. We apply our model to the case of a circumbinary planet and use a
Kepler-38 like binary system as a working example. We find that, in this low
planetary eccentricity case, the most likely final stationary rotation state is
the 1:1 spin-orbit resonance, considering an arbitrary planetary viscosity
inside the estimated range for the solar system planets. We derive analytical
expressions for the mean rotational stationary state, based on high-order power
series of the semimajor axes ratio a1 /a2 and low-order expansions of the
eccentricities. These are found to reproduce very accurately the mean behaviour
of the low-eccentric numerical integrations for arbitrary planetary relaxation
factors, and up to a1/a2 \sim 0.4. Our analytical model is used to predict the
stationary rotation of the Kepler circumbinary planets and find that most of
them are probably rotating in a sub-synchronous state, although the synchrony
shift is much less important than the one estimated in Zoppetti et al. (2019,
2020). We present a comparison of our results with those obtained with the
Constant Time Lag and find that, unlike what we assumed in our previous works,
the cross torques have a non-negligible net secular contribution, and must be
taken into account when computing the tides over each body in an
N-extended-body system from an arbitrary reference frame. These torques are
naturally taken into account in the creep theory.

Numerous traditional robust estimators are computationally intractable, which
partly contributes to the renewal of the interest in the robust mean
estimation.
  Robust centrality estimators, however, include the trimmed mean and the

  This article investigates the robustness of leading sub-Gaussian estimators
of mean and reveals that none of them can resist greater than $25\%$

winsorized mean which has the best possible robustness (can resist up to $50\%$
contamination without breakdown) meanwhile achieving high efficiency.
Furthermore, it has a sub-Gaussian performance for uncontaminated samples and a
bounded estimation error for contaminated samples at a given confidence level
in a finite sample setting. It can be computed in linear time.

The two main approaches to address this issue are based on loss function
modifications and instance resampling. Instance sampling is typically based on
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which may suffer from mode collapse.
Therefore, there is a need for an oversampling method that is specifically
tailored to deep learning models, can work on raw images while preserving their
properties, and is capable of generating high quality, artificial images that
can enhance minority classes and balance the training set. We propose DeepSMOTE
- a novel oversampling algorithm for deep learning models. It is simple, yet
effective in its design. It consists of three major components: (i) an
encoder/decoder framework; (ii) SMOTE-based oversampling; and (iii) a dedicated
loss function that is enhanced with a penalty term. An important advantage of
DeepSMOTE over GAN-based oversampling is that DeepSMOTE does not require a
discriminator, and it generates high-quality artificial images that are both
information-rich and suitable for visual inspection. DeepSMOTE code is publicly

prior knowledge, which is to be realized in general in condensed systems. To
evaluate our method, the well-known EXAFS spectrum of copper was used for the
EXAFS data analysis. We found that the advanced Fourier basis is selected as an
appropriate basis for the regression of the EXAFS signal in a quantitative way
and that the estimation of the Debye-Waller factor can be robustly realized
only by using the advanced Fourier basis. Bayesian inference based on minimal
restrictions allows us to not only eliminate some unphysical results but also
select an appropriate basis. Generally, FEFF analysis is used for estimating
physical parameters such as Deby-Waller and extracting RDF. Bayesian inference
enables us to simultaneously select an appropriate basis and optimized physical
parameters without FEFF analysis, which results in extracting RDF from only
EXAFS signals. These advantages lead to the general usage of Bayesian inference

online education. The growing policy learning literature focuses on settings
where the data collection rule stays fixed throughout the experiment. However,
adaptive data collection is becoming more common in practice, from two primary
sources: 1) data collected from adaptive experiments that are designed to
improve inferential efficiency; 2) data collected from production systems that
progressively evolve an operational policy to improve performance over time
(e.g. contextual bandits). Yet adaptivity complicates the optimal policy
identification ex post, since samples are dependent, and each treatment may not
receive enough observations for each type of individual. In this paper, we make
initial research inquiries into addressing the challenges of learning the
optimal policy with adaptively collected data. We propose an algorithm based on
generalized augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimators, which
non-uniformly reweight the elements of a standard AIPW estimator to control
worst-case estimation variance. We establish a finite-sample regret upper bound
for our algorithm and complement it with a regret lower bound that quantifies
the fundamental difficulty of policy learning with adaptive data. When equipped
with the best weighting scheme, our algorithm achieves minimax rate optimal
regret guarantees even with diminishing exploration. Finally, we demonstrate
our algorithm's effectiveness using both synthetic data and public benchmark
datasets.

communications in the Internet. While several mechanisms have been proposed to
prevent, detect or mitigate hijacking events, it has not been studied how to
accurately quantify the impact of an ongoing hijack. When detecting a hijack,
existing methods do not estimate how many networks in the Internet are affected
(before and/or after its mitigation). In this paper, we study fundamental and
practical aspects of the problem of estimating the impact of an ongoing hijack
through network measurements. We derive analytical results for the involved
trade-offs and limits, and investigate the performance of different measurement
approaches (control/data-plane measurements) and use of public measurement
infrastructure. Our findings provide useful insights for the design of accurate
hijack impact estimation methodologies. Based on these insights, we design (i)
a lightweight and practical estimation methodology that employs ping
measurements, and (ii) an estimator that employs public infrastructure
measurements and eliminates correlations between them to improve the accuracy.
We validate the proposed methodologies and findings against results from
hijacking experiments we conduct in the real Internet.

directed edges. An orientation of a mixed multigraph $G$ is an assignment of
exactly one direction to each undirected edge of $G$. A mixed multigraph $G$
can be oriented to a strongly connected digraph if and only if $G$ is
bridgeless and strongly connected [Boesch and Tindell, Am. Math. Mon., 1980].
For each $r \in \mathbb{N}$, let $f(r)$ denote the smallest number such that
any strongly connected bridgeless mixed multigraph with radius $r$ can be
oriented to a digraph of radius at most $f(r)$. We improve the current best
upper bound of $4r^2+4r$ on $f(r)$ [Chung, Garey and Tarjan, Networks, 1985] to
$1.5 r^2 + r + 1$. Our upper bound is tight upto a multiplicative factor of
$1.5$ since, $\forall r \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists an undirected bridgeless
graph of radius $r$ such that every orientation of it has radius at least $r^2
+ r$ [Chv\'atal and Thomassen, J. Comb. Theory. Ser. B., 1978]. We prove a
marginally better lower bound, $f(r) \geq r^2 + 3r + 1$, for mixed multigraphs.
While this marginal improvement does not help with asymptotic estimates, it
clears a natural suspicion that, like undirected graphs, $f(r)$ may be equal to
$r^2 + r$ even for mixed multigraphs. En route, we show that if each edge of
$G$ lies in a cycle of length at most $\eta$, then the oriented radius of $G$
is at most $1.5 r \eta$. All our proofs are constructive and lend themselves to
polynomial time algorithms.

the goal of increasing the health professionals' trust in the black box

LIME and SHAP and the alternative explanation approach CIU, centered on the
Contextual Value and Utility (CIU). The produced explanations were evaluated
using human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on the
explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical
backgrounds carried out a series of tests in the web-based survey setting and
stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user
groups (n=20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were
quantitatively analyzed. We have found that, as hypothesized, the CIU
explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of
increasing support for human decision-making as well as being more transparent
and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP
by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are
notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation
support settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable
methods that can with future improvements in implementation be generalized on
different medical data sets and can provide great decision-support for medical
experts.

important role in deep feature representation for visual tasks. Self-attention
updates the feature at each position by computing a weighted sum of features
using pair-wise affinities across all positions to capture the long-range
dependency within a single sample. However, self-attention has quadratic
complexity and ignores potential correlation between different samples. This
paper proposes a novel attention mechanism which we call external attention,
based on two external, small, learnable, shared memories, which can be
implemented easily by simply using two cascaded linear layers and two
normalization layers; it conveniently replaces self-attention in existing
popular architectures. External attention has linear complexity and implicitly
considers the correlations between all data samples. We further incorporate the
multi-head mechanism into external attention to provide an all-MLP
architecture, external attention MLP (EAMLP), for image classification.
Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, semantic
segmentation, instance segmentation, image generation, and point cloud analysis
reveal that our method provides results comparable or superior to the
self-attention mechanism and some of its variants, with much lower
computational and memory costs.

the widely studied $k$-median, $k$-means, and $k$-center objectives. The input
is a metric space containing all potential client locations. The algorithm must
select $k$ cluster centers such that they are a good solution for any subset of
clients that actually realize. Specifically, we aim for low regret, defined as
the maximum over all subsets of the difference between the cost of the
algorithm's solution and that of an optimal solution. A universal algorithm's
solution $SOL$ for a clustering problem is said to be an $(\alpha,
\beta)$-approximation if for all subsets of clients $C'$, it satisfies $SOL(C')
\leq \alpha \cdot OPT(C') + \beta \cdot MR$, where $OPT(C')$ is the cost of the
optimal solution for clients $C'$ and $MR$ is the minimum regret achievable by
any solution.
  Our main results are universal algorithms for the standard clustering
objectives of $k$-median, $k$-means, and $k$-center that achieve $(O(1),
O(1))$-approximations. These results are obtained via a novel framework for
universal algorithms using linear programming (LP) relaxations. These results
generalize to other $\ell_p$-objectives and the setting where some subset of
the clients are fixed. We also give hardness results showing that $(\alpha,
\beta)$-approximation is NP-hard if $\alpha$ or $\beta$ is at most a certain
constant, even for the widely studied special case of Euclidean metric spaces.
This shows that in some sense, $(O(1), O(1))$-approximation is the strongest
type of guarantee obtainable for universal clustering.

hot-wire (THW) method within a temperature range of room temperature to 700 oC,

different types of ceramic particles were examined: (1) CARBOBEAD HSP 40/70 and
(2) CARBOBEAD CP 40/100 with the average particle sizes of ~ 400 {\mu}m and
~280 {\mu}m, respectively, and thermal conductivities ranging from ~0.25 W m-1
K-1 to ~0.50 W m-1 K-1 from 20 oC to 700 oC in both air and N2 gas. The gaseous
pressure dependence of the thermal conductivity of the ceramic particle beds
was also studied in the N2 environment to differentiate the contributions from
gas conduction, solid conduction, and radiation. Calculations using the Zehner,
Bauer, and Schl\""under (ZBS) model showed good agreements with the

while the solid conduction and radiation contributes to about 20% of the
effective thermal conductivity at high temperature.

in a characteristic quasi-polynomial when the minimum period is strictly less

with regard to period collapse anything is possible: period collapse occurs in
any dimension $\ge 1$, occurs for any value of the lcm period $\ge 2$, and the
minimum period when it is not the lcm period can be any proper divisor of the

leverage splines to interpolate locally the dynamics, perform analytical

decoherence, which transforms a quantum state into a classical one,
superdecoherence can be used to transform a Lindblad operator (generator of
quantum evolution) into a Kolmogorov operator (generator of classical

random Kolmogorov operators. By gradually increasing strength of

implies that ($i$) the class means and the last-layer classifiers all collapse
to the vertices of a Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) up to scaling, and
($ii$) cross-example within-class variability of last-layer activations
collapses to zero. We study the problem based on a simplified

cross-entropy loss with weight decay has a benign global landscape, in the
sense that the only global minimizers are the Simplex ETFs while all other
critical points are strict saddles whose Hessian exhibit negative curvature
directions. In contrast to existing landscape analysis for deep neural networks
which is often disconnected from practice, our analysis of the simplified model
not only does it explain what kind of features are learned in the last layer,
but it also shows why they can be efficiently optimized in the simplified
settings, matching the empirical observations in practical deep network
architectures. These findings could have profound implications for
optimization, generalization, and robustness of broad interests. For example,
our experiments demonstrate that one may set the feature dimension equal to the

network training, which reduces memory cost by over $20\%$ on ResNet18 without
sacrificing the generalization performance.

content which maximizes user satisfaction on the platform. It is increasingly
obvious, however, that content providers have a critical influence on user
satisfaction through content creation, largely determining the content pool
available for recommendation. A natural question thus arises: can we design
recommenders taking into account the long-term utility of both users and
content providers? By doing so, we hope to sustain more providers and a more
diverse content pool for long-term user satisfaction. Understanding the full
impact of recommendations on both user and provider groups is challenging. This
paper aims to serve as a research investigation of one approach toward building
a provider-aware recommender, and evaluating its impact in a simulated setup.
  To characterize the user-recommender-provider interdependence, we complement
user modeling by formalizing provider dynamics as well. The resulting joint
dynamical system gives rise to a weakly-coupled partially observable Markov
decision process driven by recommender actions and user feedback to providers.
We then build a REINFORCE recommender agent, coined EcoAgent, to optimize a
joint objective of user utility and the counterfactual utility lift of the
provider associated with the recommended content, which we show to be
equivalent to maximizing overall user utility and the utilities of all
providers on the platform under some mild assumptions. To evaluate our
approach, we introduce a simulation environment capturing the key interactions
among users, providers, and the recommender. We offer a number of simulated
experiments that shed light on both the benefits and the limitations of our
approach. These results help understand how and when a provider-aware
recommender agent is of benefit in building multi-stakeholder recommender
systems.

uninsurance rate among states that did not expand Medicaid in 2014 as if they
had expanded their Medicaid eligibility requirements. Using American Community
Survey data aggregated to the region level, we estimate this effect by finding
weights that approximately reweights the expansion regions to match the
covariate distribution of the non-expansion regions. Existing methods to
estimate balancing weights often assume that the covariates are measured
without error and do not account for dependencies in the outcome model. Our
covariates have random noise that is uncorrelated with the outcome errors and
our outcome model has state-level random effects inducing dependence between
regions. To correct for the bias induced by the measurement error, we propose
generating our weights on a linear approximation to the true covariates, using
an idea from measurement error literature known as ""regression-calibration""
(see, e.g., Carroll (2006)). This requires auxiliary data to estimate the
variability of the measurement error. We also modify the Stable Balancing
Weights objective proposed by Zubizaretta (2015)) to reduce the variance of our
estimator when the model errors follow our assumed correlation structure. We
show that these approaches outperform existing methods when attempting to
predict observed outcomes during the pre-treatment period. Using this method we
estimate that Medicaid expansion would have caused a -2.33 (-3.54, -1.11)
percentage point change in the adult uninsurance rate among states that did not

$\overrightarrow{r_{k}}(H)=2^{(\log n)^{O_{k}(1)}}$ for all bounded-degree
acyclic digraphs $H$ on $n$ vertices, where $\overrightarrow{r_k}(H)$ is the
least $N$ such that every $k$-edge-colored tournament on $N$ vertices contains
a monochromatic copy of $H$. For $k\geq 2$ and $n\geq 4$, we exhibit an acyclic
digraph $H$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $3$ such that
$\overrightarrow{r_{k}}(H)\ge n^{\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)}$, showing that
these Ramsey numbers can grow faster than any polynomial in the number of
vertices.

client projects have to repetitively upgrade their library usages and adapt
their codebases to any library API breaking changes (e.g., API renaming). Such
adaptive changes can be tedious and error-prone. Existing tools provide limited
support to help programmers migrate client projects from old library versions
to new ones. For instance, some tools extract API mappings be-tween library
versions and only suggest simple adaptive changes (i.e., statement updates);
other tools suggest or automate more complicated edits (e.g., statement
insertions) based on user-provided exemplar code migrations. However, when new
library versions are available, it is usually cumbersome and time-consuming for
users to provide sufficient human-crafted samples in order to guide automatic
migration. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, AutoUpdate, to further
improve the state of the art. Instead of learning from change examples, we
designed AutoUpdate to automate migration in a compiler-directed way. Namely,
given a compilation error triggered by upgrading libraries, AutoUpdate exploits
13 migration opera-tors to generate candidate edits, and tentatively applies
each edit until the error is resolved or all edits are explored. We conducted
two experiments. The first experiment involves migrating 371 tutorial examples

order to investigate the reasons why, we ran 2D alpha disc simulations with
alpha values of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.2, and found that only the latter two exhibit
significant eccentricity growth. We present an equation expressing global
eccentricity evolution in terms of contributing forces and use it to analyze
the simulations. As expected, we find that the dominant term contributing to
the growth of eccentricity is the tidal gravity of the companion star. In the
2D simulations, the alpha viscosity directly contributes to eccentricity
growth. In contrast, the overall magnetic forces in the 3D simulation damp
eccentricity. We also analyzed the mode-coupling mechanism of Lubow, and
confirmed that the spiral wave excited by the 3:1 resonance was the dominant
contributor to eccentricity growth in the 2D $\alpha=0.1$ simulations, but
other waves also contribute significantly. We found that the $\alpha=0.1$ and
0.2 simulations had more relative mass at larger radii compared to the
$\alpha=0.01$ and 3D MHD simulation, which also had an effective $\alpha$ of
0.01. This suggests that in 3D MHD simulations without sufficient poloidal
magnetic flux, MRI turbulence does not saturate at a high enough $\alpha$ to
spread the disc to large enough radii to reproduce the superhumps observed in

sensors' locations, characteristics and acquisition time, PAN and MS image

deep-learning-based methods that were trained with such misaligned PAN-MS image
pairs suffer from diverse artifacts such as double-edge and blur artifacts in
the resultant PAN-sharpened images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
called shift-invariant pan-sharpening with moving object alignment (SIPSA-Net)
which is the first method to take into account such large misalignment of
moving object regions for PAN sharpening. The SISPA-Net has a feature alignment
module (FAM) that can adjust one feature to be aligned to another feature, even
between the two different PAN and MS domains. For better alignment in
pan-sharpened images, a shift-invariant spectral loss is newly designed, which
ignores the inherent misalignment in the original MS input, thereby having the
same effect as optimizing the spectral loss with a well-aligned MS image.
Extensive experimental results show that our SIPSA-Net can generate
pan-sharpened images with remarkable improvements in terms of visual quality

requires rapid gas cooling and has been suggested to operate in outer regions
of protoplanetary disks. The VSI drives turbulence with strong vertical
motions, which could regulate the dust growth and settling. However, dust
growth and settling can regulate the VSI because dust depletion makes gas
cooling inefficient in outer disk regions that are optically thin to their own
thermal emission. In this study, we quantify this potentially stabilizing
effects of dust evolution on the VSI based on the linear analysis. We construct
a model for calculating the cooling timescale, taking into account dust growth
beyond micron sizes and size-dependent settling. Combining the model with the
linear stability analysis, we map the region where the VSI operates, which we
call the VSI zone, and estimate the maximum growth rate at each radial
position. We find that dust growth as well as settling makes the VSI zone more
confined around the midplane. This causes a decrease in the growth rate because
the vertical shear of the rotation velocity, which is the source of the
instability, is weaker at lower altitude. In our default disk model with 0.01
solar masses, dust growth from 10 micron to 1 mm causes a decrease in the
growth rate by a factor of more than 10. The suppression of VSI-driven
turbulence by dust evolution may promote further dust evolution in the outer
regions and also explain a high degree of dust settling observed in the disk
around HL Tau.

substrate was found to be crucial for achieving a low RR in the resulting SRO
film grown afterward. The optimized initial SrO layer shows a $c$(2 x 2)
superstructure that was characterized by electron diffraction, and a series of
SRO films with different thicknesses ($t$s) were then grown. The resulting SRO
films exhibit excellent crystallinity with orthorhombic-phase down to $t
\approx$ 4.3 nm, which was confirmed by high resolution X-ray measurements.
From azimuthal X-ray scan for SRO orthorhombic (021) reflection, we uncover
four structural domains with a dominant domain of orthorhombic SRO [001] along
cubic STO [010] direction. The dominant domain population depends on $t$, STO
miscut angle (${\alpha}$), and miscut direction (${\beta}$), giving a volume
fraction of about 92 $\%$ for $t \approx$ 26.6 nm and (${\alpha}$, ${\beta}$) ~
(0.14$^{\rm o}$, 5$^{\rm o}$). On the other hand, metallic and ferromagnetic
properties were well preserved down to $t \approx$ 1.2 nm. Residual resistivity
ratio (RRR = ${\rho}$(300 K)/${\rho}$(5 K)) reduces from 77.1 for $t \approx$
28.5 nm to 2.5 for $t \approx$ 1.2 nm, while ${\rho}$(5 K) increases from 2.5
$\mu\Omega$cm for $t \approx$ 28.5 nm to 131.0 $\mu\Omega$cm for $t \approx$
1.2 nm. The ferromagnetic onset temperature ($T_c\prime$) of around 151 K
remains nearly unchanged down to $t \approx$ 9.0 nm and decreases to 90 K for
$t \approx$ 1.2 nm. Our finding thus provides a practical guideline to achieve
high crystallinity and low RR in ultra-thin SRO films by simply adjusting the
growth of initial SrO layer.

trackers carry out similarity learning via cross correlation that originates
from the image matching field. However, unlike 2-D image matching, the matching
network in object tracking requires 4-D information (height, width, channel and
time). Cross correlation neglects the information from channel and time
dimensions, and thus produces ambiguous matching. This paper proposes a
spatio-temporal matching process to thoroughly explore the capability of 4-D
matching in space (height, width and channel) and time. In spatial matching, we
introduce a space-variant channel-guided correlation (SVC-Corr) to recalibrate
channel-wise feature responses for each spatial location, which can guide the
generation of the target-aware matching features. In temporal matching, we
investigate the time-domain context relations of the target and the background
and develop an aberrance repressed module (ARM). By restricting the abrupt
alteration in the interframe response maps, our ARM can clearly suppress
aberrances and thus enables more robust and accurate object tracking.
Furthermore, a novel anchor-free tracking framework is presented to accommodate
these innovations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks including OTB100,
VOT2018, VOT2020, GOT-10k, and LaSOT demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of the proposed method.

the average gas fraction strongly depends on the stellar mass and SFR of host
galaxies; massive galaxies tend to have a lower gas fraction, and actively
star-forming galaxies show higher gas fraction, which is consistent with many
previous studies. Then we investigate the morphological dependence of the HI

spin-orbit coupling, homobilayer moire TMDs also possess either logarithmic or
power-law divergent Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Fermi surface,
controllable by an external displacement field. The former and the latter are
dubbed conventional and higher-order VHS, respectively. Here, we perform a
perturbative renormalization group (RG) analysis to unbiasedly study the
dominant instabilities in homobilayer TMDs for both the conventional and
higher-order VHS cases. We find that the spin-valley locking largely alters the
RG flows and leads to instabilities unexpected in the corresponding
extensively-studied graphene-based moire systems, such as spin- and
valley-polarized ferromagnetism and topological superconductivity with mixed

spin-valley-locking-driven metallic state with no symmetry breaking in the TMDs

promising performance, these existing solutions can hardly be considered
satisfactory. First, these ML-based methods in DBMS are not effective enough
because they are optimized on each specific task, and cannot explore or
understand the intrinsic connections between tasks. Second, the training
process has serious limitations that hinder their practicality, because they
need to retrain the entire model from scratch for a new DB. Moreover, for each

simple computational elements called amoebots that interact locally to
collectively achieve tasks of coordination and movement. Since its introduction
at SPAA 2014, a growing body of literature has adapted its assumptions for a
variety of problems; however, without a standardized hierarchy of assumptions,
precise systematic comparison of results under the amoebot model is difficult.
We propose the canonical amoebot model, an updated formalization that
distinguishes between core model features and families of assumption variants.
A key improvement addressed by the canonical amoebot model is concurrency. Much
of the existing literature implicitly assumes amoebot actions are isolated and
reliable, reducing analysis to the sequential setting where at most one amoebot
is active at a time. However, real programmable matter systems are concurrent.
The canonical amoebot model formalizes all amoebot communication as message
passing, leveraging adversarial activation models of concurrent executions.
Under this granular treatment of time, we take two complementary approaches to
concurrent algorithm design. We first establish a set of sufficient conditions
for algorithm correctness under any concurrent execution, embedding concurrency
control directly in algorithm design. We then present a concurrency control
framework that uses locks to convert amoebot algorithms that terminate in the
sequential setting and satisfy certain conventions into algorithms that exhibit
equivalent behavior in the concurrent setting. As a case study, we demonstrate
both approaches using a simple algorithm for hexagon formation. Together, the
canonical amoebot model and these complementary approaches to concurrent
algorithm design open new directions for distributed computing research on
programmable matter.

transfers between materials with translational invariance. The central physical
quantities are the screened Coulomb potential and the spectrum function of
polarizability. Within the random phase approximation, we calculate the
polarizability using the linear response density functional theory and obtain
the screened Coulomb potential from a retarded Dyson equation. We show that the
heat transfer mediated by the Coulomb interaction is consistent with that of
the $p$-polarized evanescent waves which dominate the heat transfer in the near
field. We adopt single-layer graphene as an example to calculate heat transfers
between two parallel sheets separated by a vacuum gap $d$. Our results show a
saturation of heat flux at the extreme near field which is different from the
reported $1/d$ dependence for local response functions. The calculated heat
flux is up to $5\times10^4$ times more than the black-body limit, and a $1/d^2$
dependence is shown at large separations. From the spectrum of energy current
density, we infer that the near-field enhancement of heat transfer stems from
electron transitions around the Fermi energy. With a uniform strain, the heat
flux increases for most of the distances while a negative correlation is shown
at the moderate field. Our method is valid for inhomogeneous materials in which
the macroscopic response function used in conventional theory of fluctuational
electrodynamics would fail at the subnanometer scale.

unreliable networks and the DoS attacks, allowed to occur aperiodically, refer
to an interruption of the communication channels carried out by the intelligent
adversaries. In contrast to many existing distributed convex optimization works
over a prefect communication network, the global optimal solution might not be
sought under the adverse influences that result in performance degradations or
even failures of optimization algorithms. The aforementioned setting poses
certain technical challenges to optimization algorithm design and exponential
convergence analysis. In this work, several resilient algorithms are presented
such that a team of agents minimizes a sum of local non-quadratic cost
functions in a safe and reliable manner with global exponential convergence.
Inspired by the preliminary works in [15]-[18], an explicit analysis of
frequency and duration of attacks is investigated to guarantee exponential
optimal solutions. Numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed design.

proposed method enjoys great advantages, especially for large-scale

challenging key subproblem of the classic ALM by employing its linearized

that only a smaller proximity regularization term is needed for provable
convergence, which allows a bigger step-size and hence significantly better
performance. Moreover, we show the global convergence of the proposed scheme

worst-case $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ convergence rate. Numerical results on some

field. With the fast development of deep learning technology in recent years,
MOT has achieved great improvement. However, some challenges still remain, such
as sensitiveness to occlusion, instability under different lighting conditions,
non-robustness to deformable objects, etc. To address such common challenges in
most of the existing trackers, in this paper, a tracklet booster algorithm is
proposed, which can be built upon any other tracker. The motivation is simple
and straightforward: split tracklets on potential ID-switch positions and then
connect multiple tracklets into one if they are from the same object. In other
words, the tracklet booster consists of two parts, i.e., Splitter and
Connector. First, an architecture with stacked temporal dilated convolution
blocks is employed for the splitting position prediction via label smoothing
strategy with adaptive Gaussian kernels. Then, a multi-head self-attention
based encoder is exploited for the tracklet embedding, which is further used to
connect tracklets into larger groups. We conduct sufficient experiments on

nature that relies on localized control and information sharing over a sparse
communication network. That is, a distributed control manner could be prone to
malicious attacks and unreliable communication that deteriorate the formation
tracking performance or even destabilize the whole multi-agent system. This
paper studies a safe and reliable time-varying output formation tracking
problem of linear multi-agent systems, where an attacker adversely injects any
unbounded time-varying signals (false data injection (FDI) attacks), while an
interruption of communication channels between the agents is caused by an
unreliable network. Both characteristics improve the practical relevance of the
problem to be addressed, which poses some technical challenges to the
distributed algorithm design and stability analysis. To mitigate the adverse
effect, a novel resilient distributed control architecture is established to
guarantee time-varying output formation tracking exponentially. The key
features of the proposed framework are threefold: 1) an observer-based
identifier is integrated to compensate for adverse effects; 2) a reliable
distributed algorithm is proposed to deal with time-varying topologies caused
by unreliable communication; and 3) in contrast to the existing remedies that
deal with attacks as bounded disturbances/faults with known knowledge, we

mesoscale features. In order to parametrize the vertical mixing, K-Profile
Parametrization (KPP) scheme is implemented. The results show successful

differences in turbulent kinetic energy (K), production flux (P), buoyancy flux

inverse energy-cascade in the southern Bay of Bengal, wherein energy flows back
into mean flow structures from the turbulent eddies. The re-energization of
mean flow structures is likely to allow the large-scale circulation to persist

to recover a corresponding 3D face mesh. Recently, both optimization-based and
learning-based face reconstruction methods have taken advantage of the emerging
differentiable renderer and shown promising results. However, the
differentiable renderer, mainly based on graphics rules, simplifies the
realistic mechanism of the illumination, reflection, \etc, of the real world,
thus cannot produce realistic images. This brings a lot of domain-shift noise
to the optimization or training process. In this work, we introduce a novel
Generative Adversarial Renderer (GAR) and propose to tailor its inverted
version to the general fitting pipeline, to tackle the above problem.
Specifically, the carefully designed neural renderer takes a face normal map
and a latent code representing other factors as inputs and renders a realistic
face image. Since the GAR learns to model the complicated real-world image,
instead of relying on the simplified graphics rules, it is capable of producing
realistic images, which essentially inhibits the domain-shift noise in training
and optimization. Equipped with the elaborated GAR, we further proposed a novel
approach to predict 3D face parameters, in which we first obtain fine initial
parameters via Renderer Inverting and then refine it with gradient-based
optimizers. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed generative adversarial renderer and the novel
optimization-based face reconstruction framework. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performances on multiple face reconstruction datasets.

systems that are considered trusted by a verifier system, while the prover has

  models",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the introduction of the CDC 6600 in 1965 and its `scoreboarding'
technique processors have not (necessarily) executed instructions in program
order. Programmers of high-level code may sequence independent instructions in
arbitrary order, and it is a matter of significant programming abstraction and
computational efficiency that the processor can be relied upon to make sensible
parallelizations/reorderings of low-level instructions to take advantage of,
eg., multiple ALUs. At the architectural level such reordering is typically
implemented via a per-processor pipeline, into which instructions are fetched
in order, but possibly committed out of order depending on local
considerations, provided any reordering preserves sequential semantics from
that processor's perspective. However multicore architectures, where several
pipelines run in parallel, can expose these processor-level reorderings as
unexpected, or `weak', behaviours. Such weak behaviours are hard to reason
about, and (via speculative execution) underlie at least one class of
widespread security vulnerability.
  In this paper we introduce a novel program operator, \emph{parallelized
sequential composition}, which can be instantiated with a function that
controls the reordering of atomic instructions. It generalises both sequential
and parallel composition, and when appropriately instantiated exhibits many of
the weak behaviours of well-known hardware weak memory models. Our framework
admits the application of established compositional techniques (eg.
Owicki-Gries) for reasoning about weak behaviours, and is convenient for
abstractly expressing properties from the literature. The semantics and theory
is encoded and verified in a theorem prover, and we give an implementation of
the pipeline semantics which we use to empirically show conformance against
established models of ARM and RISC-V.

experimentally, however more than 7000 isotopes are predicted to exist in the
nuclear landscape from H (Z=1) to Og (Z=118) based on various theoretical
calculations. Exploring the mass of the remains is a hot topic in nuclear
physics. Machine learning has been served as a powerful tool in learning
complex representations of big data in many fields. Purpose: We use Light
Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) which is a highly efficient machine
learning algorithm to predict the masses of unknown nuclei and to explore the
nuclear landscape in neutron-rich side from learning the measured nuclear
masses. Results: By using the experimental data of 80 percent of known nuclei
as the training dataset, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the
predicted and the experimental binding energy of the remaining 20% is about
0.234 MeV, 0.213 MeV, 0.170 MeV, and 0.222 MeV for the LightGBM-refined LDM,
DZ, WS4, and FRDM models, respectively. These values are of about 90%, 65%,
40%, and 60% smaller than the corresponding origin mass models. The RMSD for 66
newly measured nuclei that appeared in AME2020 is also significantly improved
on the same foot. One-neutron and two-neutron separation energies predicted by
these refined models are in consistence with several theoretical predictions
based on various physical models. Conclusions: LightGBM can be used to refine
theoretical nuclear mass models so as to predict the binding energy of unknown
nuclei. Moreover, the correlation between the input characteristic quantities
and the output can be interpreted by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP, a
popular explainable artificial intelligence tool), this may provide new

and expressive singing voice, in which the acoustic model generates the
acoustic features (e.g., mel-spectrogram) given a music score. Previous singing
acoustic models adopt a simple loss (e.g., L1 and L2) or generative adversarial
network (GAN) to reconstruct the acoustic features, while they suffer from
over-smoothing and unstable training issues respectively, which hinder the
naturalness of synthesized singing. In this work, we propose DiffSinger, an
acoustic model for SVS based on the diffusion probabilistic model. DiffSinger
is a parameterized Markov chain that iteratively converts the noise into
mel-spectrogram conditioned on the music score. By implicitly optimizing
variational bound, DiffSinger can be stably trained and generate realistic
outputs. To further improve the voice quality and speed up inference, we
introduce a shallow diffusion mechanism to make better use of the prior
knowledge learned by the simple loss. Specifically, DiffSinger starts
generation at a shallow step smaller than the total number of diffusion steps,
according to the intersection of the diffusion trajectories of the ground-truth
mel-spectrogram and the one predicted by a simple mel-spectrogram decoder.
Besides, we propose boundary prediction methods to locate the intersection and
determine the shallow step adaptively. The evaluations conducted on a Chinese
singing dataset demonstrate that DiffSinger outperforms state-of-the-art SVS
work. Extensional experiments also prove the generalization of our methods on
text-to-speech task (DiffSpeech). Audio samples: https://diffsinger.github.io.

producing solitary wave behaviour. We then study the behaviour of travelling

exists a value of the precompression above which the two Stokes curves coalesce

cancellation does not occur in chains with strong precompression.

signalled by the non-analyticities in the Loschmidt rate, its interrelation
with various correlation measures such as the equilibrium order parameters of
the system remains unclear. In this work, by considering the quench dynamics in
an interacting topological model, we find that the equilibrium order parameters
of the model in general exhibit signatures around the DQPT, in the short time
regime. The first extrema of the equilibrium order parameters are connected to
the first Loschmidt rate peak. By studying the unequal-time two-point
correlation, we also find that the correlation between the nearest neighbors
decays while that with neighbors further away builds up as time grows in the
non-interacting case, and upon the addition of repulsive intra-cell
interactions. On the other hand, the inter-cell interaction tends to suppress
the two-site correlations. These findings could provide us insights into the
characteristic of the system around DQPTs, and pave the way to a better
understanding of the dynamics in non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

articulating 3D characters using enveloping with a pre-defined skeletal
structure which produces high quality pose dependent deformations. Our
framework learns to rig and skin characters with the same articulation
structure (e.g., bipeds or quadrupeds), and builds the desired skeleton
hierarchy into the network architecture. Furthermore, we propose neural blend
shapes--a set of corrective pose-dependent shapes which improve the deformation
quality in the joint regions in order to address the notorious artifacts
resulting from standard rigging and skinning. Our system estimates neural blend
shapes for input meshes with arbitrary connectivity, as well as weighting
coefficients which are conditioned on the input joint rotations. Unlike recent
deep learning techniques which supervise the network with ground-truth rigging
and skinning parameters, our approach does not assume that the training data
has a specific underlying deformation model. Instead, during training, the
network observes deformed shapes and learns to infer the corresponding rig,
skin and blend shapes using indirect supervision. During inference, we
demonstrate that our network generalizes to unseen characters with arbitrary

From the 15 GHz light curve, we estimated the variability time scales of the

experienced 6 radio flux enhancements with variability time scales of 9-187
days during the observing period, yielding corresponding variability Doppler
factors of 9-27. From the multi-frequency simultaneous KVN observations, we
were able to obtain accurate radio spectra of the source and hence to more
precisely measure the turnover frequencies $\nu_{\rm r}$ of synchrotron
self-absorbed (SSA) emission with a mean value of $\nu_{rm r}$ = 28.9 GHz.
Using jet geometry assumptions, we estimated the size of the emitting region at
the turnover frequency. We found that the equipartition magnetic field strength
is up to two orders of magnitudes higher than the SSA magnetic field strength
(0.001-0.1 G). This is consistent with the source being particle dominated. We
performed a careful analysis of the systematic errors related to making these

Computationally, we find that many-body interactions in Pd and CoO2 layers are
highly different. Holes in the CoO2 layer interact strongly with
charge-transfer excitons in the same layer, whereas holes in the Pd layer
couple to plasmons in the Pd layer. Interestingly, we find that holes in states
hybridized across both layers couple to both types of excitations
(charge-transfer excitons or plasmons), with the intensity of photoemission
satellites being proportional to the projection of the state onto a given

hybridization. These findings pave the way towards a better understanding of

  For any commutative ring spectrum $R$, we prove a symmetric monoidal
reconstruction theorem for genuine $G$-$R$-modules, which records them in terms

cohomologies. This reconstruction theorem follows from a symmetric monoidal
stratification (in the sense of \cite{AMR-strat}); here we identify the gluing
functors of this stratification in terms of Tate cohomology.
  Passing from genuine $G$-spectra to genuine $G$-$\mathbb{Z}$-modules (a.k.a.
derived Mackey functors) provides a convenient intermediate category for
calculating equivariant cohomology. Indeed, as $\mathbb{Z}$-linear Tate
cohomology is far simpler than $\mathbb{S}$-linear Tate cohomology, the above

new datasets, largely due to the limited diversity of 2D-3D pose pairs in the
training data. To address this problem, we present PoseAug, a new
auto-augmentation framework that learns to augment the available training poses
towards a greater diversity and thus improve generalization of the trained
2D-to-3D pose estimator. Specifically, PoseAug introduces a novel pose
augmentor that learns to adjust various geometry factors (e.g., posture, body
size, view point and position) of a pose through differentiable operations.
With such differentiable capacity, the augmentor can be jointly optimized with
the 3D pose estimator and take the estimation error as feedback to generate
more diverse and harder poses in an online manner. Moreover, PoseAug introduces
a novel part-aware Kinematic Chain Space for evaluating local joint-angle
plausibility and develops a discriminative module accordingly to ensure the
plausibility of the augmented poses. These elaborate designs enable PoseAug to
generate more diverse yet plausible poses than existing offline augmentation
methods, and thus yield better generalization of the pose estimator. PoseAug is
generic and easy to be applied to various 3D pose estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PoseAug brings clear improvements on both
intra-scenario and cross-scenario datasets. Notably, it achieves 88.6% 3D PCK

single stage by concurrently localizing person instance points and estimating

inter-instance ordinal depth loss to obtain depth-coherent body mesh

$\epsilon_t$. It is of order unity at initialization but decreases by several
decades during training for state-of-the-art architectures. For CIFAR10 and 15

obtaining a small $R_f$ is important to achieve good performance. We study how

following seminal work by Flandrin and others, which exploits connections with
Gaussian analytic functions (GAFs). However, the zero sets (or extrema) of GAFs
have a complicated stochastic structure, complicating any direct theoretical
analysis. Standard techniques largely rely on statistical observables from the

spectrogram analysis via an examination of the stochastic geometric properties

theoretical underpinnings, we propose a level sets based algorithm for signal

effectiveness via extensive empirical studies. Our results also have

morphology of the obtained polycrystalline deposits of MAPbI3. Although the
crystalline width and length markedly decreased for substrates with higher
curvatures, the photoluminescence (PL) spectral peak positions did not
significantly evolve for MAPbI3 deposits on substrates with different

microcrystalline MAPbI3 deposits on cylinder-shaped substrates with higher

variability of the heat capacities and the substrate curvature-enhanced solvent
evaporation rate seemed to contribute the most to the crystallization process

transmitted in the amplitude, phase and spatial domains through selected
antennas. In the coherent domain, generalized SM (GSM) employs multiple
antennas in combination during every time slot to enhance the spectral
efficiency (SE). In this paper, we propose two differential schemes which
activate two or more antennas at a time to transmit the modulated symbol. These
schemes achieve higher SE using a lesser number of antennas and lower order
modulation schemes instead of the higher number of antennas required for
conventional SM schemes based on differential modulation. Simulation studies
reveal that the proposed schemes have better bit error rate performance than
traditional differential SM schemes. We also derive the analytical union bound
for the proposed schemes and is satisfied from medium to high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) ranges.

  Visual Tracking",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Siamese trackers are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks recently.
However, the existing attack methods craft the perturbations for each video
independently, which comes at a non-negligible computational cost. In this
paper, we show the existence of universal perturbations that can enable the
targeted attack, e.g., forcing a tracker to follow the ground-truth trajectory
with specified offsets, to be video-agnostic and free from inference in a
network. Specifically, we attack a tracker by adding a universal imperceptible
perturbation to the template image and adding a fake target, i.e., a small
universal adversarial patch, into the search images adhering to the predefined
trajectory, so that the tracker outputs the location and size of the fake
target instead of the real target. Our approach allows perturbing a novel video
to come at no additional cost except the mere addition operations -- and not
require gradient optimization or network inference. Experimental results on
several datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively fool the Siamese
trackers in a targeted attack manner. We show that the proposed perturbations
are not only universal across videos, but also generalize well across different
trackers. Such perturbations are therefore doubly universal, both with respect
to the data and the network architectures. We will make our code publicly
available.

their study, which represents a multidisciplinary subject, embraces a great
variety of research fields. Especially concerning the latter, the analysis of
facial expressions represents a very active research area due to its relevance
to human-computer interaction applications. In such a context, Facial
Expression Recognition (FER) is the task of recognizing expressions on human
faces. Typically, face images are acquired by cameras that have, by nature,
different characteristics, such as the output resolution. It has been already
shown in the literature that Deep Learning models applied to face recognition
experience a degradation in their performance when tested against
multi-resolution scenarios. Since the FER task involves analyzing face images
that can be acquired with heterogeneous sources, thus involving images with
different quality, it is plausible to expect that resolution plays an important
role in such a case too. Stemming from such a hypothesis, we prove the benefits
of multi-resolution training for models tasked with recognizing facial
expressions. Hence, we propose a two-step learning procedure, named MAFER, to
train DCNNs to empower them to generate robust predictions across a wide range
of resolutions. A relevant feature of MAFER is that it is task-agnostic, i.e.,
it can be used complementarily to other objective-related techniques. To assess
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we performed an extensive
experimental campaign on publicly available datasets: \fer{}, \raf{}, and
\oulu{}. For a multi-resolution context, we observe that with our approach,
learning models improve upon the current SotA while reporting comparable
results in fix-resolution contexts. Finally, we analyze the performance of our
models and observe the higher discrimination power of deep features generated
from them.

independence structure of vector-valued data. However, in many modern
applications, e.g., those involving EEG and fMRI data, the observations are
more appropriately modeled as multivariate random functions rather than
vectors. Functional graphical models have been proposed to model the
conditional independence structure of such functional data. We propose a
neighborhood selection approach to estimate the structure of Gaussian
functional graphical models, where we first estimate the neighborhood of each

graph structure by combining the estimated neighborhoods. Our approach only
requires assumptions on the conditional distributions of random functions and
we estimate the conditional independence structure directly. We thus circumvent
the need for a well-defined precision operator that may not exist when the
functions are infinite dimensional. In addition, the neighborhood selection
approach is computationally efficient and can be easily parallelized. The
statistical consistency of our proposed method in the high-dimensional setting
is supported by both theory and experimental results. In addition, we study the
effect of the choice of the function basis used for dimensionality reduction in
an intermediate step. We give a criterion for choosing a function basis and
motivate two practically useful choices, which we justify by both theory and

we study the effect of socioeconomic status on brain structure, using data on
education and income together with hippocampal volumes estimated by magnetic
resonance imaging. By combining semiparametric estimation with latent variable
modeling, GALAMMs allow a more realistic representation of how brain and
cognition vary across the lifespan, while simultaneously estimating latent
traits from measured items. Simulation experiments suggest that model estimates
are accurate even with moderate sample sizes.

richer data modalities has enabled researchers and city administrators to
understand the built environment, socioeconomics, and the dynamics of cities
better. While some efforts have been made to simultaneously use multi-modal

'proximity' in the same embedding space - leveraging not only the data that
characterizes the regions (e.g., street view, local businesses pattern) but
also those that depict the relationship between regions (e.g., trips, road

geotagged inputs as either node or edge features of a multi-graph based on
their relations with the neighborhood region (e.g., tiles, census block, ZIP
code region, etc.). We then learn the neighborhood representation based on a
contrastive-sampling scheme from the multi-graph. Specifically, we use street
view images and POI features to characterize neighborhoods (nodes) and use
human mobility to characterize the relationship between neighborhoods (directed
edges). We show the effectiveness of the proposed methods with quantitative
downstream tasks as well as qualitative analysis of the embedding space: The

corresponding edges are adjacent in $G$. For a positive integer $k$, the
iterated line-graph $L^k(G)$ is defined recursively by $L^k(G)=L(L^{k-1}(G))$.
We consider fifteen graph parameters and study their behaviour when the
operation of taking the line-graph is iterated. We shall first show that all of
these parameters are unbounded. This idea is motivated by a well-known result
of van Rooij and Wilf that says that the number of vertices is unbounded if and
only if the graph is prolific. We then study of the value of $k(P,{\mathcal
F})$, which is the index of a family of prolific graphs with regards to a given
graph parameter $P(G)$. For a given parameter $P(G)$, the index of $G$ is
denoted by $ind(P,G) = \min \{ r : P(G) < P(L^r(G) \}$. Now for a family

exactly determine $k(P,\mathcal F)$ where $\mathcal F$ is the family of all
prolific graphs, and for some parameters we also characterize the class of

the performance gap from the perspectives of data precision and gradient

Nuisance models, both treatment assignment probability given the covariates

semiparametric locally efficient dimension reduction estimators, thereby
allowing for large sets of confounding covariates. Techniques including linear
extrapolation, numerical differentiation, and truncation have been used to

proposes a framework named FedFace to innovate federated learning for face

Partially Federated Momentum (PFM) and Federated Validation (FV). PFM locally
applies an estimated equivalent global momentum to approximating the
centralized momentum-SGD efficiently. FV repeatedly searches for better
federated aggregating weightings via testing the aggregated models on some

used to replace batch normalization followed with ReLU. Finally, BLSTM in
PHASEN is replaced with Conv2d operation and the phase stream is simplified.

imaginary parts (CRIP) of IFFT output electrically (E-CRIP) or optically
(O-CRIP). Analytical analysis and simulation works are presented to show that
compared to the Hermitian symmetric system, the proposed method slightly
increases the spectral efficiency, eliminates ISI, significantly reduces the
amount of needed calculation and does not effect the error performance. In
addition, the O-CRIP method is less affected by clipping noise that may occur
due to the imperfections of the transmitter front-ends.

traits. When various biological processes occur (survival, reproduction,
migration, etc.), the trait distribution may change with respect to time and
space. In the context of invasions, when considering the evolution of a
heritable trait that encodes the dispersive ability of individuals, the trait
distribution develops a particular spatial structure that leads to the
acceleration of the front propagation. That phenomenon is known as spatial
sorting. Many biological examples can be cited like the bush cricket in
Britain, the cane toad invasion in Australia or the common myna one in South
Africa. Adopting this framework, recent mathematical studies have led to
highlight the influence of the reproductive mode on the front propagation.
Asexual populations have been shown to spread with an asymptotic rate of t 3/2
in a minimal reactiondiffusion model, whereas the analogous rate for sexual
populations is of t 5/4 (where t denotes the time). However, the precise
description of the behaviour of the front propagation in the sexual case is
still an open question. The aim of this paper is to give precise approximations
for large times of its position, as well as some features of the local trait
distribution at the front. To do so, we solve explicitly the asymptotic problem
derived formally. Numerical simulations are shown to confirm these
calculations.

$\nu\ge -1$ (extending the known range of this result) and that $xP_{\nu}(x)$

polarizabilities based on Hirshfeld volume partitioning of the charge density

environment-dependent polarizabilities are then used to parametrize a screened
London-dispersion approximation to the vdW interactions. Our ML vdW model only
needs to learn the charge density partitioning implicitly, by learning the
reference Hirshfeld volumes from density functional theory (DFT). In practice,
we can predict accurate Hirshfeld volumes from the knowledge of the local
atomic environment (atomic positions) alone, making the model highly
computationally efficient. For additional efficiency, our ML model of atomic
polarizabilities reuses the same many-body atomic descriptors used for the
underlying GAP learning of bonded interatomic interactions. We also show how
the method enables straightforward computation of gradients of the observables,
even when these remain challenging for the reference method (e.g., calculating
gradients of the Hirshfeld volumes in DFT). Finally, we demonstrate the
approach by studying the phase diagram of C$_{60}$, where vdW effects are
important. The need for a highly accurate vdW-inclusive reactive force field is
highlighted by modeling the decomposition of the C$_{60}$ molecules taking

  Honeyboost is an unsupervised method comprising two approaches: horizontal

communications of each node, with node-level features encapsulating their
behavior over time. The vertical approach finds anomalies in each protocol
space. Using a window-based model, which is typically used in online scenarios,
the horizontal and vertical approaches are combined to identify anomalies and
gain useful insights. Experimental results indicate the efficacy of our
framework in identifying suspicious activities of nodes.

quantum-classical models: the electrons retain their quantum character, whereas
the ions are considered to be classical particles. We discuss various
alternative approaches for the computation of equilibrium (canonical) ensemble
averages for observables of these hybrid quantum-classical systems through the
use of molecular dynamics (MD), i.e. by performing dynamics in the presence of
a thermostat and computing time averages over the trajectories. Often, in
classical or ab initio MD, the temperature of the electrons is ignored and they
are assumed to remain at the instantaneous ground state given by each ionic
configuration during the evolution. Here, however, we discuss the general case
that considers both classical and quantum subsystems at finite temperature
canonical equilibrium. Inspired by a recent formal derivation for the canonical
ensemble for quantum classical hybrids, we discuss previous approaches found in
the literature, and provide some new formulas.

  effect","5 pages,7 figures",,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is proposed a novel method of the spectrally selective detection of the
short spin waves (or magnons) by means of the transverse magneto-optical (MO)
intensity effect in transmission in the magnetoplasmonic nanostructure. The
method is based on the analysis of the MO effect spectrum versus the modulation
of the sample magnetization (i.e. spin wave) and related spatial symmetry
breaking in the magnetic layer. The spatial symmetry breaking leads to the
appearance of MO effect modulation at the normal incidence of light in the
spectral range of the optical states (SPP and waveguide modes) and the breaking
of the antisymmetry of the effect with respect to the sign of the incidence
angle of light. Besides it is revealed that the magnitude of the MO effect
varies with respect to the phase shift between the spin wave and the plasmonic
grating as a harmonic function with a period equal to the magnon wavelength.
All these facts allow to detect the spin waves of the certain wavelength
propagating in the nanostructure by measuring of the MO effect in the
nanostructure.

applications, its quality and reliability start to raise concerns. Similar to
the traditional software development process, testing the DL software to

deployment. Although recent progress has been made in designing novel testing
techniques for DL software, the distribution of generated test data is not
taken into consideration. It is therefore hard to judge whether the identified
errors are indeed meaningful errors to the DL application. Therefore, we
propose a new OOD-guided testing technique which aims to generate new unseen

binary star UV Piscium (UV Psc). This system contains two active late-type
stars, UV Psc A (G5V) and B (K3V). To obtain a complete picture, the properties
of both global and local magnetic field structures are studied for both
components. High-resolution intensity and circular polarisation spectra,
collected in 2016 with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the CFHT, were used
to analyse the magnetic field of UV Psc. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio,
the multi-line technique of least-squares deconvolution (LSD) was used to
obtain average Stokes IV profiles. Then, a Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) code
was employed to obtain the large-scale magnetic field topology and brightness
distribution for both components of UV Psc. In addition, the small-scale
magnetic fields, not visible to ZDI, were studied using the Zeeman
intensification of Fe I lines. Maps of the surface magnetic field for both
components of UV Psc were obtained, the large-scale magnetic fields feature
strong toroidal and non-axisymetric components. UV Psc A and B have average
global field strengths of 137 G and 88 G, respectively. The small-scale fields
are notably stronger, with average strengths of 2.5 and 2.2 kG, respectively.
Our results are in agreement with previous studies of partly-convective stars.
Overall, UV Psc A has a stronger magnetic field compared to UV Psc B. Due to
the eclipsing binary geometry, certain magnetic field features are not
detectable using circular polarisation only. An investigation into theoretical
linear polarisation profiles shows that they could be used to reveal
antisymmetric components of the magnetic field. This result also has
implications for the study of exoplanetary transit hosts.

outperforms the strong baselines for both present and absent keyphrases

given video and let it scale and move according to a pre-set trajectory. The
proxy task is to estimate the position and size of the image patch in a
sequence of video frames, given only the target bounding box in the first
frame. We discover that using multiple image patches simultaneously brings
clear benefits. We further increase the difficulty of the game by randomly
making patches invisible. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate the superior performance of CtP against other video pretraining
methods. In addition, CtP-pretrained features are less sensitive to domain gaps
than those trained by a supervised action recognition task. When both trained
on Kinetics-400, we are pleasantly surprised to find that CtP-pretrained

role in many branches of mathematics, such as combinatorial representation

dominant weight, it is proved by Lenart-Lubovsky that the quantum alcove model
does not depend on the choice of a reduced alcove path, which is a shortest
path of alcoves from the fundamental one to its translation by the given
dominant weight. This is established through quantum Yang-Baxter moves, which
biject the objects of the model associated with two such alcove paths, and can
be viewed as a generalization of jeu de taquin slides to arbitrary root
systems. The purpose of this paper is to give a generalization of quantum
Yang-Baxter moves to the quantum alcove model corresponding to an arbitrary

equivariant $K$-group of semi-infinite flag manifolds. The generalized quantum
Yang-Baxter moves give rise to a ""sijection"" (bijection between signed sets),

obtain an identity for the graded characters of Demazure submodules of

transiting exoplanets could be used to test GR and to gain information about

high degree of degeneracy in the orbital parameters that, combined to the
uncertainties of photometric transit observations, results in large errors on
the determinations of the argument of periastron and precludes a direct
evaluation of the apsidal line precession. Moreover, tidal and GR precession
time-scales are many order of magnitudes larger than orbital periods, so that
on the observational time-spans required to cumulate a precession signal enough
strong to be detected, even small systematic errors in transit ephemerides add
up to cancel out the tiny variations due to precession. Here we present a more

The halo properties can be constrained from X-ray spectroscopic observations
and from satellite galaxies' ram-pressure stripping studies. Results of the
former method crucially depend on the gas metallicity assumptions while the
latter one's are insensitive to them. Here, a joint analysis of both kinds of
data is presented to constrain electron density and metallicity of the gas. The
power law is assumed for the electron density radial profile, while for the
metallicity, a common-used constant-metallicity assumption is relaxed by
introducing of a physically motivated spherical profile. The model is fitted to
a sample of 431 (18) sight lines for O VII emission (absorption) measurements
and 7 electron density constraints from ram-pressure stripping studies. The

promising mechanical properties and biocompatibility. However, their
excessively fast corrosion rate hinders the development of Mg alloys in the
biomedical fields. Inspired by conventional ion implantation, a less-toxic
functional group (hydroxyl) is used as the ion source to bombard the ZK60 Mg
alloy surface to form a functionalized oxide layer. This functionalized oxide
layer significantly facilitates the corrosion resistance of the ZK60 Mg alloy
substrate and the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells, which is confirmed by
electrochemical, immersion, and in vitro cytocompatibility tests. In comparison
with results of ZK60 alloy implanted with carboxyl ions in our previous work,
it is concluded that hydroxyl-treated alloys exhibit slightly higher corrosion
rate while better biocompatibility. In summary, less-toxic functional ion
implantation can be an effective strategy for inhibiting corrosion of Mg alloy
implants and promoting their biocompatibility.

efficient suppression of noise-induced spectral broadening and therefore, to a
narrow spectrum. The technique is well established in laser physics, where a
phenomenological description due to Adler is usually sufficient. Recently,
locking experiments were performed in Josephson photonics devices, where
microwave radiation is created by inelastic Cooper pair tunneling across a
dc-biased Josephson junction connected in-series with a microwave resonator. An
in-depth theory of locking for such devices, accounting for the Josephson
non-linearity and the specific engineered environments, is lacking.
  Here, we study injection locking in a typical Josephson photonics device
where the environment consists of a single mode cavity, operated in the
classical regime. We show that an in-series resistance, however small, is an
important ingredient in describing self-sustained Josephson oscillations and
enables the locking region. We derive a dynamical equation describing locking,
similar to an Adler equation, from the specific circuit equations. The effect
of noise on the locked Josephson phase is described in terms of phase slips in
a modified washboard potential. For weak noise, the spectral broadening is
reduced exponentially with the injection signal. When this signal is provided
from a second Josephson device, the two devices synchronize. In the linearized
limit, we recover the Kuramoto model of synchronized oscillators. The picture
of classical phase slips established here suggests a natural extension towards
a theory of locking in the quantum regime.

  Neural Network",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Brain graphs (i.e, connectomes) constructed from medical scans such as
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have become increasingly important tools to
characterize the abnormal changes in the human brain. Due to the high
acquisition cost and processing time of multimodal MRI, existing deep learning
frameworks based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) focused on predicting
the missing multimodal medical images from a few existing modalities. While
brain graphs help better understand how a particular disorder can change the
connectional facets of the brain, synthesizing a target brain multigraph (i.e,
multiple brain graphs) from a single source brain graph is strikingly lacking.
Additionally, existing graph generation works mainly learn one model for each
target domain which limits their scalability in jointly predicting multiple
target domains. Besides, while they consider the global topological scale of a
graph (i.e., graph connectivity structure), they overlook the local topology at
the node scale (e.g., how central a node is in the graph). To address these
limitations, we introduce topology-aware graph GAN architecture (topoGAN),
which jointly predicts multiple brain graphs from a single brain graph while
preserving the topological structure of each target graph. Its three key
innovations are: (i) designing a novel graph adversarial auto-encoder for
predicting multiple brain graphs from a single one, (ii) clustering the encoded
source graphs in order to handle the mode collapse issue of GAN and proposing a
cluster-specific decoder, (iii) introducing a topological loss to force the
prediction of topologically sound target brain graphs. The experimental results
using five target domains demonstrated the outperformance of our method in
brain multigraph prediction from a single graph in comparison with baseline

public datasets were used to train the U-nets and to evaluate their
segmentation performances, which have been quantified in terms of the Dice
index. The accuracy in predicting the CT-Severity Score (CT-SS) of the
LungQuant system has been also evaluated. Both Dice and accuracy showed a
dependency on the quality of annotations of the available data samples. On an
independent and publicly available benchmark dataset, the Dice values measured
between the masks predicted by LungQuant system and the reference ones were

Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are employed to drive an underlying

different possible implementations, yielding a variety of different performance

address computational challenges arising in real-world applications, for
instance with highly concentrated posterior distributions. Furthermore, we
introduce different strategies for designing cheaper schemes, for instance,
recycling samples generated in the upper layer and using them in the final
estimators in the lower layer. Different numerical experiments, considering
several challenging scenarios, show the benefits of the proposed schemes

  Reinforcement Learning","36 pages, 27 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown outstanding performance on
inducing effective action policies that maximize expected long-term return on
many complex tasks. Much of DRL work has been focused on sequences of events
with discrete time steps and ignores the irregular time intervals between
consecutive events. Given that in many real-world domains, data often consists
of temporal sequences with irregular time intervals, and it is important to
consider the time intervals between temporal events to capture latent
progressive patterns of states. In this work, we present a general Time-Aware
RL framework: Time-aware Q-Networks (TQN), which takes into account physical
time intervals within a deep RL framework. TQN deals with time irregularity
from two aspects: 1) elapsed time in the past and an expected next observation
time for time-aware state approximation, and 2) action time window for the
future for time-aware discounting of rewards. Experimental results show that by
capturing the underlying structures in the sequences with time irregularities
from both aspects, TQNs significantly outperform DQN in four types of contexts
with irregular time intervals. More specifically, our results show that in
classic RL tasks such as CartPole and MountainCar and Atari benchmark with
randomly segmented time intervals, time-aware discounting alone is more
important while in the real-world tasks such as nuclear reactor operation and
septic patient treatment with intrinsic time intervals, both time-aware state
and time-aware discounting are crucial. Moreover, to improve the agent's
learning capacity, we explored three boosting methods: Double networks, Dueling
networks, and Prioritized Experience Replay, and our results show that for the
two real-world tasks, combining all three boosting methods with TQN is
especially effective.

potential risk using video footage gathered by road security cameras deployed
at such crossings. The proposed system automatically detects vehicles and
pedestrians, calculates trajectories by frames, and extracts behavioral
features affecting the likelihood of potentially dangerous scenes between these

extracted features accumulated in a data warehouse to perform multidimensional
analysis for potential risk scenes with levels of abstraction, but this is
beyond the scope of this paper, and will be detailed in a future study. In our
experiment, we focused on extracting the various behavioral features from

contribute to potential risk. We validated feasibility and applicability by
applying it in multiple crosswalks in Osan city, Korea.

an operador $T: X \rightarrow Y$, there is $\eta = \eta(\eps, T)$ such that if
$x$ satisfies $\|T(x)\| > 1 - \eta$, then there exists $x_0 \in S_X$ such that
$x_0 \approx x$ and $T$ itself attains its norm at $x_0$. This can be seen as a
strong (although local) Bollob\'as theorem for operators. We prove that the
pair $(X, Y)$ has the {\bf L}$_{o,o}$ for compact operators if and only if so

  Pathways for Precipitation Nowcasting",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the goal of predicting the future rainfall intensity in a local region
over a relatively short period time, precipitation nowcasting has been a
long-time scientific challenge with great social and economic impact. The radar
echo extrapolation approaches for precipitation nowcasting take radar echo
images as input, aiming to generate future radar echo images by learning from
the historical images. To effectively handle complex and high non-stationary
evolution of radar echoes, we propose to decompose the movement into optical
flow field motion and morphologic deformation. Following this idea, we
introduce Flow-Deformation Network (FDNet), a neural network that models flow
and deformation in two parallel cross pathways. The flow encoder captures the
optical flow field motion between consecutive images and the deformation
encoder distinguishes the change of shape from the translational motion of
radar echoes. We evaluate the proposed network architecture on two real-world
radar echo datasets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art prediction results
compared with recent approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first network architecture with flow and deformation separation to model the
evolution of radar echoes for precipitation nowcasting. We believe that the
general idea of this work could not only inspire much more effective approaches
but also be applied to other similar spatiotemporal prediction tasks

lending by sequentially bringing potential contributors, each of whose
decisions impact other contributors in the market. However, understanding the
dynamics of sequential contributions in online platforms for peer lending has
been an open ended research question. The centralized investment mechanism in
these platforms makes it difficult to understand the implicit competition that
borrowers face from a single lender at any point in time. Matching markets are
a model of pairing agents where the preferences of agents from both sides in
terms of their preferred pairing for transactions can allow to decentralize the
market. We study investment designs in two sided platforms using matching
markets when the investors or lenders also face restrictions on the investments
based on borrower preferences. This situation creates an implicit competition
among the lenders in addition to the existing borrower competition, especially
when the lenders are uncertain about their standing in the market and thereby
the probability of their investments being accepted or the borrower loan
requests for projects reaching the reserve price. We devise a technique based
on sequential decision making that allows the lenders to adjust their choices
based on the dynamics of uncertainty from competition over time. We simulate
two sided market matchings in a sequential decision framework and show the
dynamics of the lender regret amassed compared to the optimal borrower-lender
matching and find that the lender regret depends on the initial preferences set
by the lenders which could affect their learning over decision making steps.

several examples of deviations from Brownian behavior, generally defined as
anomalous diffusion. The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better
understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a
quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often
challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using
classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods.
Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi,
https://www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these
approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous
diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the
classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In
this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi
challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering
(AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a
straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing
resources, making a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening.

explore its use for discrete-level control (with M $\geq$ 2 levels) including,
in particular, a practical scheme for digital-to-analog conversion. The
resulting computations, for each planning period, amount to iterating
forward-backward Gaussian message passing recursions (similar to Kalman
smoothing), with a complexity (per iteration) that is linear in the planning
horizon. In consequence, the proposed method is not limited to a short planning
horizon and can therefore outperform ""optimal"" methods. A preference for sparse
level switches can easily be incorporated.

planar random walks, namely diagonal, simultaneous and radial records. The mean
numbers of these records grow as universal power laws of time, with respective
exponents 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2. The study of diagonal and simultaneous records
relies on the underlying renewal structure of the successive hitting times and
locations of translated copies of a fixed target. In this sense, this work
represents a two-dimensional extension of the analysis made by Feller of ladder
points, i.e., records for one-dimensional random walks. This approach yields a
variety of analytical asymptotic results, including the full statistics of the
numbers of diagonal and simultaneous records, the joint law of the epoch and
location of the current diagonal record and the angular distribution of the
current simultaneous record. The sequence of radial records cannot be
constructed in terms of a renewal process. In spite of this, their mean number
is shown to grow with a super-universal square-root law for isotropic random
walks in any spatial dimension. Their full distribution is also obtained.
Higher-dimensional diagonal and simultaneous records are also briefly
discussed.

are studied by renormalization-group theory by exact solution of a hierarchical
lattice and, equivalently, approximate Migdal-Kadanoff solutions of a cubic
lattice. The recursion, under rescaling, of coupled random-field and
random-bond (induced under rescaling by random fields) coupled probability
distributions is followed to obtain phase diagrams. Unlike the Ising model
(q=2), several types of random fields can be defined for q >= 3 Potts models,
including random-axis favored, random-axis disfavored, random-axis randomly
favored or disfavored cases, all of which are studied. Quantitatively very
similar phase diagrams are obtained, for a given q for the three types of field
randomness, with the low-temperature ordered phase persisting, increasingly as
temperature is lowered, up to random-field threshold in d=3, which is
calculated for all temperatures below the zero-field critical temperature.
Phase diagrams thus obtained are compared as a function of $q$. The ordered
phase in the low-q models reaches higher temperatures, while in the high-q
models it reaches higher random fields. This renormalization-group calculation
result is physically explained.

  Textual Graph",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The representation learning on textual graph is to generate low-dimensional
embeddings for the nodes based on the individual textual features and the
neighbourhood information. Recent breakthroughs on pretrained language models
and graph neural networks push forward the development of corresponding
techniques. The existing works mainly rely on the cascaded model architecture:
the textual features of nodes are independently encoded by language models at
first; the textual embeddings are aggregated by graph neural networks
afterwards. However, the above architecture is limited due to the independent
modeling of textual features. In this work, we propose GraphFormers, where
layerwise GNN components are nested alongside the transformer blocks of
language models. With the proposed architecture, the text encoding and the
graph aggregation are fused into an iterative workflow, making each node's
semantic accurately comprehended from the global perspective. In addition, a
progressive learning strategy is introduced, where the model is successively
trained on manipulated data and original data to reinforce its capability of
integrating information on graph. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three
large-scale benchmark datasets, where GraphFormers outperform the SOTA
baselines with comparable running efficiency.

security services to ensure their communication security. Cryptography, as the
inseparable tool for providing security services, requires a robust key
management system. Alas, the absence of infrastructure in cooperative networks
leads to the infeasibility of providing conventional key management systems.
Key pre-distribution schemes have shown promising performance in different
cooperative networks due to their lightweight nature. However, intermediate
decryption-encryption (DE) steps and the lack of key updates are the most
concerning issues they suffer from. In this paper, we propose a simple and
effective key management algorithm inspired by the idea of key
pre-distribution, where it utilizes the highly dynamic UAV node movement in 3D
space to provide the key update feature and optimizes the number of
intermediate DE steps. Although it is a general model for any mobile ad hoc
network, we have selected UAV network as an example domain to show the
efficiency of the model given the high mobility. We define the communication
density parameter to analytically show that using any highly dynamic random
movement pattern leads our algorithm to work effectively. To show the proposed
algorithm's effectiveness, we exhaustively analyze its security and performance
in the UAV network using the ns-3 network simulator. Results validate our
analytical findings and show how the highly dynamic UAV network movement helps
our algorithm to provide the key update feature and to optimize the number of

pushdown automata (HD-PDA) over finite words, that is, pushdown automata whose
nondeterminism can be resolved based on the run constructed so far, but
independently of the remainder of the input word. These are also known as
good-for-games pushdown automata. We prove that HD-PDA recognise more languages
than deterministic PDA (DPDA) but not all context-free languages (CFL). This
class is orthogonal to unambiguous CFL. We further show that HD-PDA can be
exponentially more succinct than DPDA, while PDA can be double-exponentially
more succinct than HD-PDA. We also study HDness in visibly pushdown automata
(VPA), which enjoy better closure properties than PDA, and for which we show
that deciding HDness is ExpTime-complete. HD-VPA can be exponentially more
succinct than deterministic VPA, while VPA can be exponentially more succinct

PDA for which composition with games is well-behaved, i.e. good-for-games

potentially infinitely branching games. Finally, we study the complexity of
resolving nondeterminism in HD-PDA. Every HDPDA has a positional resolver, a
function that resolves nondeterminism and that is only dependant on the current

of HD-VPA, but not those of HD-PDA. HD-PDA with finite-state resolvers are

and has been one of the most challenging aspects of digital image processing.
Practically it is impossible to design a segmentation algorithm which has 100%

the literature, each with certain limitations. In this paper, a novel
Falling-Ball algorithm is presented, which is a region-based segmentation
algorithm, and an alternative to watershed transform (based on waterfall
model). The proposed algorithm detects the catchment basins by assuming that a
ball falling from hilly terrains will stop in a catchment basin. Once catchment
basins are identified, the association of each pixel with one of the catchment
basin is obtained using multi-criterion fuzzy logic. Edges are constructed by
dividing image into different catchment basins with the help of a membership
function. Finally closed contour algorithm is applied to find closed regions
and objects within closed regions are segmented using intensity information.
The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated both objectively as well
as subjectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms gives
superior performance over conventional Sobel edge detection methods and the
watershed segmentation algorithm. For comparative analysis, various comparison
methods are used for demonstrating the superiority of proposed methods over
existing segmentation methods.

warfarin response, we hypothesized that longitudinal dose response data will
improve maintenance dose predictions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed a
dataset from the COAG warfarin dosing study, which includes clinical data,
warfarin doses and INR measurements over the study period, and maintenance dose
when therapeutic INR was achieved. Various machine learning regression models
to predict maintenance warfarin dose were trained with clinical factors and
dosing history and INR data as features. Overall, dose revision algorithms with
a single dose and INR achieved comparable performance as the baseline dose
revision algorithm. In contrast, dose revision algorithms with longitudinal
dose and INR data provided maintenance dose predictions that were statistically
significantly much closer to the true maintenance dose. Focusing on the best
performing model, gradient boosting (GB), the proportion of ideal estimated
dose, i.e., defined as within $\pm$20% of the true dose, increased from the
baseline (54.92%) to the GB model with the single (63.11%) and longitudinal
(75.41%) INR. More accurate maintenance dose predictions with longitudinal dose
response data can potentially achieve therapeutic INR faster, reduce
drug-related complications and improve patient outcomes with warfarin therapy.

resonance imaging enabling the direct measurement of the shape of arbitrarily
formed, closed pores by probing diffusion restrictions using the motion of
spin-bearing particles. Examples of such pores comprise cells in biological
tissue or oil containing cavities in porous rocks. All pores contained in the
measurement volume contribute to one reconstructed image, which reduces the
problem of vanishing signal at increasing resolution present in conventional
magnetic resonance imaging. It has been previously experimentally demonstrated
that pore imaging using a combination of a long and a narrow magnetic field
gradient pulse is feasible. In this work, an experimental verification is
presented showing that pores can be imaged using short gradient pulses only.
Experiments were carried out using hyperpolarized xenon gas in well-defined
pores. The phase required for pore image reconstruction was retrieved from
double diffusion encoded (DDE) measurements, while the magnitude could either
be obtained from DDE signals or classical diffusion measurements with single
encoding. The occurring image artifacts caused by restrictions of the gradient
system, insufficient diffusion time, and by the phase reconstruction approach
were investigated. Employing short gradient pulses only is advantageous
compared to the initial long-narrow approach due to a more flexible sequence
design when omitting the long gradient and due to faster convergence to the
diffusion long-time limit, which may enable application to larger pores.

lead to phenomena like long-lived photoluminescence and photoconductivity. In
contrast, persistent photo-response due to ionic metastable states is rare. In
this work, we report persistent structural and ferroelectric photo-responses
due to proton metastable states via a nuclear quantum mechanism in
ferroelectric croconic acid, in which the proton-transfer origin of
ferroelectricity is important for the ionic metastable states. We show that,
after photoexcitation, the changes of structural and ferroelectric properties
relax in about 1000 s, while the photoconductivity decays within 1 s,
indicating the dominant ionic origin of the responses. The photogenerated
internal bias field that survives polarization switching process suggests
another proton transfer route and metastable state, in addition to the
metastable states resulting from proton transfer along the hydrogen bonds
proposed previously. Analysis based on Frank Condon principle reveals the
quantum mechanical nature of the proton-transfer process both within the
hydrogen bonds and out of the hydrogen bonds, where small mass of proton and
significant change of potential landscape due to the excited electronic states
are the key. The demonstration of persistent photo-responses due to the proton
metastable states unveils a nuclear quantum mechanism for photo-tunability of
materials, which is expected to impact many material properties sensitive to
ionic positions.

In this paper, we propose a new information-theoretic probe, Bird's Eye, which
is a fairly simple probe method for detecting if and how these representations
encode the information in these linguistic graphs. Instead of using classifier
performance, our probe takes an information-theoretic view of probing and
estimates the mutual information between the linguistic graph embedded in a
continuous space and the contextualized word representations. Furthermore, we
also propose an approach to use our probe to investigate localized linguistic

ability to encode a syntactic and a semantic graph structure, and find that
these models encode to some degree both syntactic as well as semantic
information; albeit syntactic information to a greater extent.

In addition to four translational moduli non-Abelian strings under
consideration carry six orientational and size moduli. Together they form a
ten-dimensional space required for a superstring to be critical. The target
space of the string sigma model is a product of the flat four-dimensional space
$\mathbb{R}^4$ and a Calabi-Yau non-compact threefold $Y_6$, namely, the
conifold. The spectrum of low lying closed string states in the associated type
IIA string theory was found and interpreted as a spectrum of hadrons in 4D
${\mathcal N}=2\;$ SQCD. In particular, the lowest string state appears to be a
massless BPS baryon associated with the deformation of the complex structure
modulus $b$ of the conifold. Here we address a problem of switching on quark
masses in 4D SQCD, which classically breaks the world sheet conformal
invariance in the string sigma model. To avoid this problem we follow a
standard string theory approach and use a flux ""compactification"" to lift the
complex structure modulus of the conifold. Namely, we find a solution of
supergravity equations of motion with non-zero NS 3-form flux. It produces a
potential for the baryon $b$, which leads to the run-away vacuum. Using field
theory arguments we interpret 3-form flux in terms of a particular choice of
quark masses in 4D SQCD. At the run-away vacuum the conifold degenerates to
lower dimensions. We interpret this as a flow from a non-Abelian string to an
Abelian one.

optimal operation of dynamical processes that has been shown to improve process

strategies, reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated as a model-free
control methodology, but issues regarding its safety and stability remain an
open research challenge. This work presents a novel framework for integrating
EMPC and RL for online model parameter estimation of a class of nonlinear
systems. In this framework, EMPC optimally operates the closed loop system
while maintaining closed loop stability and recursive feasibility. At the same
time, to optimize the process, the RL agent continuously compares the measured
state of the process with the model's predictions (nominal states), and
modifies model parameters accordingly. The major advantage of this framework is
its simplicity; state-of-the-art RL algorithms and EMPC schemes can be employed
with minimal modifications. The performance of the proposed framework is
illustrated on a network of reactions with challenging dynamics and practical
significance. This framework allows control, optimization, and model correction
to be performed online and continuously, making autonomous reactor operation
more attainable.

attention mechanisms to produce probability distributions over input token

of attention-based explanations for text classification. We achieve this by
proposing a new family of Task-Scaling (TaSc) mechanisms that learn
task-specific non-contextualised information to scale the original attention
weights. Evaluation tests for explanation faithfulness, show that the three
proposed variants of TaSc improve attention-based explanations across two
attention mechanisms, five encoders and five text classification datasets
without sacrificing predictive performance. Finally, we demonstrate that TaSc
consistently provides more faithful attention-based explanations compared to
three widely-used interpretability techniques.

Cosmology in the framework of string theory. Specifically, we considered a
string-inspired Cosmology with primordial gravitational waves (GW) and
gravitational anomalies, which were argued to lead, via appropriate
condensation during the very-early-universe era, to dynamical inflation, of RVM
type, without the need for extra inflaton fields. A crucial role for the
associated slow-roll nature of the inflationary era was played by the
fundamental axion field that exists in the gravitational multiplet of strings,
viz. the Kalb-Ramond (KR) axion. In this paper, we study further this model and
demonstrate several novel facts, completing our previous studies. We clarify
the different roles played by the background KR axions, which constitute a form
of stiff matter that dominates a pre-RVM-inflationary epoch of the Universe. We
show that the KR axion when combined with the gravitational Chern-Simons
contribution obey together a peculiar equation of state $p=-\rho$, with
negative energy density $\rho < 0$, which we call `phantom vacuum'. Eventually,
this state transmutes into the standard vacuum state thanks to the contribution
from the gravitational Chern-Simons condensate, which makes the total
$\rho_{\rm total} =-p_{\rm total} >0$. At this point the RVM vacuum picture
emerges naturally, with an overall equation of state of true vacuum type. We
find that our scenario is consistent with the trans-Planckian censorship
hypothesis, given that the rate of change of the KR axion takes only
sub-Planckian values. We also discuss some explicit scenarios on the creation
of GWs within the context of supergravity models that could be embedded in our
string theory framework. {Finally, we argue how the RVM in our context can help
to alleviate the current tensions of the $\Lambda$CDM.}

neutron star and characterise the plasma conditions in the selected regions by
means of spectral fitting. Results: The first full view of SNR G53.41+0.03

brightness and hardness of the spectra, and are all best characterised by a hot
plasma model in a non-equilibrium ionisation state. Of the three regions, the
brightest one contains the most mature plasma, with ionisation age $\tau
\approx 4\times10^{10}$s cm$^{-3}$ (where $\tau = n_e t$), a lower electron
temperature of kT$_\mathrm{e} \approx 1$ keV and the highest estimated gas
density of n$_\mathrm{H}\approx 0.87$ cm$^{-3}$. The second, fainter but
spectrally harder, region reveals a younger plasma ($\tau \approx
1.7\times10^{10}$s cm$^{-3}$) with higher temperature (kT$_\mathrm{e} \approx
2$ keV) and two to three times lower density (n$_\mathrm{H}\approx 0.34$
cm$^{-3}$). The third region is very faint, but we identify spectroscopically
the presence of a hot plasma.Employing several methods for age estimation, we
find the remnant to be $t \approx 1000-5000$ yrs old, confirming the earlier
reports of a relatively young age. The environment of the remnant also contains
a number of point sources, of which most are expected to be positioned in the
foreground. Of the two point sources in the geometrical centre of the remnant
one is consistent with the characteristics of a young neutron star.

Out of 21 targeted fields, 19 galaxies were detected in CO(3-2) with the

field. These galaxies are either bona fide members of the CL1301.7$-$1139
cluster ($z=0.4828$, $\sigma_{cl}=681$ km s$^{-1}$), or located within $\sim 7

of photometric local densities around CL1301.7$-$1139, with stellar masses
above log($M_{\rm star}$) = 10, and to be located in the blue clump of
star-forming galaxies derived from the $u$, $g$, and $i$ photometric bands.
Unlike previous works, our sample selection does not impose a minimum star
formation rate or detection in the far-infrared. As such and as much as
possible, it delivers an unbiased view of the gas content of normal
star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 0.5$. Our study highlights the variety of
paths to star formation quenching, and most likely the variety of physical
properties (i.e. temperature, density) of the corresponding galaxy's cold
molecular gas. Just as in the case of CL1411.1$-$1148, although to a smaller
extent, we identify a number of galaxies with lower gas fraction than
classically found in other surveys. These galaxies can still be on the
star-forming main sequence. When these galaxies are not inside the cluster
virialised region, we provide hints that they are linked to their infall
regions within $\sim 4 \times R_{200}$.

split the costs within the travellers of a group, are non-trivial tasks, as two
objectives conflict: 1) minimising the total costs of the system, and 2) making
each user content with her assignment. Aligning both objectives is challenging,
as users are not aware of the externalities induced to the rest of the system.
  In this paper, we propose protocols to share the costs within a ride so that
optimal solutions can also constitute equilibria. To do this, we model the
situation as a game. We show that the traditional notions of equilibrium in
game theory (Nash and Strong) are not useful here, and prove that determining
whether a Strong Equilibrium exists is an NP-Complete problem. Hence, we
propose three alternative equilibrium notions (stronger than Nash and weaker
than Strong), depending on how users can coordinate, that effectively represent
stable ways to match the users. We then propose three cost-sharing protocols,
for which the optimal solutions are an equilibrium for each of the mentioned
intermediate notions of equilibrium. The game we study can be seen as a
game-version of the well-known \textit{set cover problem}.
  Numerical simulations for Amsterdam reveal that our protocols can achieve
stable solutions that are always close to the optimum, that there exists a
trade-off between total users' costs and how equal do they distribute among
them, and that having a central coordinator can have a large impact.

spins fluctuating around the spiral contours in the momentum space, and at low
temperatures supports a vector spin-chirality order despite the absence of
long-range magnetic order. In a strong contrast, for the Ising moments, the
low-temperature spin correlation forms a reciprocal ""kagom\'e"" structure in the
momentum space that resembles the SSL behaviors and persists for a range of
exchange couplings. The unexpected emergence and persistence of the reciprocal
""kagom\'e"" are attributed to the stiffness of the Ising moments and the
frustration. At higher temperatures when the thermal fluctuations is strong and
the spin correlation is not fully melted, the reciprocal structures evolve from
the ""kagom\'e"" towards the ones demanded by the soft spin limit. This contrasts
strongly with the behaviors of the spiral contours in the SSL regime for the

coronary artery segmentation in X-ray angiograms (XAs) due to their common
tubular structures. However, it is challenged by the cross-anatomy domain shift
due to the intrinsically different vesselness characteristics in different
anatomical regions under even different imaging protocols. To solve this
problem, we propose a Semi-Supervised Cross-Anatomy Domain Adaptation (SS-CADA)
which requires only limited annotations for coronary arteries in XAs. With the
supervision from a small number of labeled XAs and publicly available labeled
FIs, we propose a vesselness-specific batch normalization (VSBN) to
individually normalize feature maps for them considering their different
cross-anatomic vesselness characteristics. In addition, to further facilitate
the annotation efficiency, we employ a self-ensembling mean-teacher (SEMT) to
exploit abundant unlabeled XAs by imposing a prediction consistency constraint.
Extensive experiments show that our SS-CADA is able to solve the challenging
cross-anatomy domain shift, achieving accurate segmentation for coronary
arteries given only a small number of labeled XAs.

the validity of this notion for inferring causal relationships among time

primarily limited the applications of Granger causality to simple bivariate

light using high signal-to-noise spectrophotometry of 173 SNe Ia from the
Nearby Supernova Factory. We decompose the diversity of these spectra into
different extrinsic and intrinsic components, and we construct a nonlinear
parameterization of the intrinsic diversity of SNe Ia that preserves pairings
of ""twin"" SNe Ia. We call this parameterization the ""Twins Embedding"". Our
methodology naturally handles highly nonlinear variability in spectra, such as
changes in the photosphere expansion velocity, and uses the full spectrum
rather than being limited to specific spectral line strengths, ratios or
velocities. We find that the time evolution of SNe Ia near maximum light is
remarkably similar, with 84.6% of the variance in common to all SNe Ia. After
correcting for brightness and color, the intrinsic variability of SNe Ia is
mostly restricted to specific spectral lines, and we find intrinsic dispersions
as low as ~0.02 mag between 6600 and 7200 A. With a nonlinear three-dimensional
model plus one dimension for color, we can explain 89.2% of the intrinsic
diversity in our sample of SNe Ia, which includes several different kinds of
""peculiar"" SNe Ia. A linear model requires seven dimensions to explain a
comparable fraction of the intrinsic diversity. We show how a wide range of
previously-established indicators of diversity in SNe Ia can be recovered from
the Twins Embedding. In a companion article, we discuss how these results an be
applied to standardization of SNe Ia for cosmology.

irradiation from the central star. Numerical experiments of Watanabe \& Lin
(2008) suggested that such disks, also called `passive disks', suffer from a
thermal instability. Here, we use analytical and numerical tools to elucidate
the nature of this instability. We find that it is related to the flaring of
the optical surface, the layer at which starlight is intercepted by the disk.
Whenever a disk annulus is perturbed thermally and acquires a larger scale
height, disk flaring becomes steeper in the inner part, and flatter in the
outer part. Starlight now shines more overhead for the inner part and so can
penetrate into deeper layers; conversely, it is absorbed more shallowly in the
outer part. These geometric changes allow the annulus to intercept more
starlight, and the perturbation grows. We call this the irradiation
instability. It requires only ingredients that are known to exist in realistic
disks, and operates best in parts that are both optically thick and
geometrically thin (inside 30AU, but can extend to further reaches when, e.g.,
dust settling is considered). An unstable disk develops travelling thermal
waves that reach order-unity in amplitude. In thermal radiation, such a disk
should appear as a series of bright rings interleaved with dark shadowed gaps,
while in scattered light it resembles a moving staircase. Depending on the gas
and dust responses, this instability could lead to a wide range of
consequences, such as {\w ALMA rings and gaps,} dust traps, vertical
circulation, vortices and turbulence.

correspond to a crystalline version of 3D topological insulators and
topological superconductors in the famous ten-fold-way classification, with the
time-reversal symmetry replaced by the mirror symmetry and with strong
interaction taken into account. For surface SETs, the most general interplay
between symmetries and anyon excitations is considered. Based on the previously
proposed dimension reduction and folding approaches, we re-derive the
classification of bulk SPT phases and define a \emph{complete} set of bulk
topological invariants for every symmetry group under consideration, and then
derive explicit expressions of the bulk invariants in terms of surface
topological properties (such as topological spin, quantum dimension) and
symmetry properties (such as mirror fractionalization, fractional charge or
spin). These expressions are our quantitative bulk-boundary correspondences.
Meanwhile, the bulk topological invariants can be interpreted as \emph{anomaly
indicators} for the surface SETs which carry 't Hooft anomalies of the
associated symmetries whenever the bulk is topologically non-trivial. Hence,
the quantitative bulk-boundary correspondences provide an easy way to compute
the 't Hooft anomalies of the surface SETs. Moreover, our anomaly indicators
are complete. Our derivations of the bulk-boundary correspondences and anomaly
indicators are explicit and physically transparent.

natural language tasks such as fair classification, style transfer and sentence
generation, among others. The existent dominant approaches in the context of
text data {either rely} on training an adversary (discriminator) that aims at
making attribute values difficult to be inferred from the latent code {or rely
on minimising variational bounds of the mutual information between latent code
and the value attribute}. {However, the available methods suffer of the
impossibility to provide a fine-grained control of the degree (or force) of
disentanglement.} {In contrast to} {adversarial methods}, which are remarkably
simple, although the adversary seems to be performing perfectly well during the
training phase, after it is completed a fair amount of information about the
undesired attribute still remains. This paper introduces a novel variational
upper bound to the mutual information between an attribute and the latent code
of an encoder. Our bound aims at controlling the approximation error via the
Renyi's divergence, leading to both better disentangled representations and in
particular, a precise control of the desirable degree of disentanglement {than

industrial machine investigation and inspection with domain shifts due to
changes in operational and environmental conditions. Conventional methods for
anomalous sound detection face practical challenges because the distribution of
features changes between the training and operational phases (called domain
shift) due to various real-world factors. To check the robustness against
domain shifts, we need a dataset that actually includes domain shifts, but such
a dataset does not exist so far. The new dataset we created consists of the
normal and abnormal operating sounds of five different types of industrial
machines under two different operational/environmental conditions (source
domain and target domain) independent of normal/abnormal, with domain shifts
occurring between the two domains. Experimental results showed significant
performance differences between the source and target domains, indicating that
the dataset contains the domain shifts. These findings demonstrate that the
dataset will be helpful for checking the robustness against domain shifts. The
dataset is a subset of the dataset for DCASE 2021 Challenge Task 2 and freely

way to determine the mood based on text-based communication. In this paper, we
present the results of a systematic literature review of sentiment analysis
tools developed for or applied in the context of software engineering. Our
results summarize insights from 80 papers with respect to (1) the application
domain, (2) the purpose, (3) the used data sets, (4) the approaches for
developing sentiment analysis tools and (5) the difficulties researchers face
when applying sentiment analysis in the context of software projects. According
to our results, sentiment analysis is frequently applied to open-source
software projects, and most tools are based on support-vector machines. Despite
the frequent use of sentiment analysis in software engineering, there are open
issues, e.g., regarding the identification of irony or sarcasm, pointing to
future research directions.

the $G_0$-equivariant projections $\varphi:\overline{\mathcal O_{\sf min}}\to

is shown that the properties of $\overline{\varphi(\mathcal O_{\sf min})}$ and

We prove that $\overline{G{\cdot}\varphi(\mathcal O_{\sf

O_{\sf min}\cap\mathfrak g_1\ne\varnothing$, then this common variety is the

reveal a key mechanism of explicit symmetry breaking behind the efficiency and

discrete learning dynamics of gradient descent using a continuous-time

identify ""kinetic symmetry breaking"" (KSB), the condition when the kinetic

Noether's theorem known in physics to take into account KSB and derive the
resulting motion of the Noether charge: ""Noether's Learning Dynamics"" (NLD).
Finally, we apply NLD to neural networks with normalization layers and reveal
how KSB introduces a mechanism of ""implicit adaptive optimization"",

separate the spin AM from the orbital AM in the gauge invariant manner are
based on the ansatz that the gluon field can be presented in form of the
decomposition where the physical gluon components are additive to the pure
gauge gluon components, i.e. $A_\mu = A_\mu^{\text{phys}}+A_\mu^{\text{pure}}$.
In the present paper, we show that in the non-Abelian gauge theory this gluon
decomposition has a strong mathematical evidence in the frame of the contour
gauge conception. In other words, we reformulate the gluon decomposition ansatz
as a theorem on decomposition and, then, we use the contour gauge to prove this
theorem. In the first time, we also demonstrate that the contour gauge
possesses the special kind of residual gauge related to the boundary field
configurations and expressed in terms of the pure gauge fields. As a result,
the trivial boundary conditions lead to the inference that the decomposition
includes the physical gluon configurations only provided the contour gauge
condition.

a vision transformer with a feed-forward layer applied over the patch
dimension. The resulting architecture is simply a series of feed-forward layers
applied over the patch and feature dimensions in an alternating fashion. In
experiments on ImageNet, this architecture performs surprisingly well: a
ViT/DeiT-base-sized model obtains 74.9\% top-1 accuracy, compared to 77.9\% and
79.9\% for ViT and DeiT respectively. These results indicate that aspects of
vision transformers other than attention, such as the patch embedding, may be
more responsible for their strong performance than previously thought. We hope
these results prompt the community to spend more time trying to understand why

provide valuable cues for classification. This paper presents a novel MIL
approach that exploits the spatial relationship of tiles for classifying whole
slide images. To do so, a sparse map is built from tiles embeddings, and is
then classified by a sparse-input CNN. It obtained state-of-the-art performance
over popular MIL approaches on the classification of cancer subtype involving
10000 whole slide images. Our results suggest that the proposed approach might
(i) improve the representation learning of instances and (ii) exploit the
context of instance embeddings to enhance the classification performance. The

spanning from January 2019 to April 2021 in order to assess how successful an
investment strategy relying on the community's recommendations could have been.
We detect buy and sell advice and identify the community's most popular stocks,
based on which we define a WSB portfolio. Our evaluation shows that this
portfolio has grown approx. 200% over the last three years and approx. 480%
over the last year, significantly outperforming the S&P500. The average
short-term accuracy of buy and sell signals, in contrast, is not found to be
significantly better than randomly or equally distributed buy decisions within

yielding higher returns than the broader market or the strategy of trusting all

find high-quality solutions in polynomial time. The design of either an exact
algorithm or an approximate algorithm for these problems often requires
significantly specialized knowledge. Recently, deep learning methods provide
new directions to solve such problems. In this paper, an end-to-end deep
reinforcement learning framework is proposed to solve this type of
combinatorial optimization problems. This framework can be applied to different
problems with only slight changes of input (for example, for a traveling
salesman problem (TSP), the input is the two-dimensional coordinates of nodes;
while for a capacity-constrained vehicle routing problem (CVRP), the input is
simply changed to three-dimensional vectors including the two-dimensional
coordinates and the customer demands of nodes), masks and decoder context
vectors. The proposed framework is aiming to improve the models in literacy in
terms of the neural network model and the training algorithm. The solution
quality of TSP and the CVRP up to 100 nodes are significantly improved via our
framework. Specifically, the average optimality gap is reduced from 4.53\%
(reported best \cite{R22}) to 3.67\% for TSP with 100 nodes and from 7.34\%
(reported best \cite{R22}) to 6.68\% for CVRP with 100 nodes when using the
greedy decoding strategy. Furthermore, our framework uses about 1/3$\sim$3/4
training samples compared with other existing learning methods while achieving
better results. The results performed on randomly generated instances and the
benchmark instances from TSPLIB and CVRPLIB confirm that our framework has a
linear running time on the problem size (number of nodes) during the testing
phase, and has a good generalization performance from random instance training
to real-world instance testing.

the second one by Karmarkar condition. Moreover, we also calculate the values
of constant parameters by using the observational data of these compact stars,

a way for applications such as electronic devices and sensors. From this
perspective, Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) is a fairly simple system that
offers great possibilities for tuning electronic gap and charge carriers'
mobility by selective functionalization (adsorptions of atoms or molecules).
Here, we present a detailed numerical study of BLG electronic properties when
two types of adsorption site are present simultaneously. We focus on realistic
cases that could be realized experimentally with adsorbate concentration c
varying from 0.25% to 5%. For a given value of c, when the electronic doping is
lower than c we show that quantum effects, which are ignored in usual
semi-classical calculations, strongly affect the electronic structure and the
transport properties. A wide range of behaviors is indeed found, such as gap
opening, metallic behavior or abnormal conductivity, which depend on the
adsorbate positions, the c value, the doping, and eventually the coupling
between midgap states which can create a midgap band. These behaviors are
understood by simple arguments based on the fact that BLG lattice is bipartite.
We also analyze the conductivity at low temperature, where multiple scattering
effects cannot be ignored. Moreover, when the Fermi energy lies in the band of
midgap states, the average velocity of charge carriers cancels but conduction
is still possible thanks to quantum fluctuations of the velocity.

Aharonian et al. 2007) and utilized in the analysis. We employed a new
methodology which assumes that the gamma-ray counts are expressed by a linear
combination of two terms; one is proportional to the ISM column density and the
other proportional to the X-ray count. We then assume these represent the
hadronic and leptonic components, respectively. By fitting the expression to
the data pixels, we find that the gamma-ray counts are well represented by a
flat plane in a 3D space of the gamma-ray counts, the ISM column density and
the X-ray counts. The results using the latest H.E.S.S. data at 4.8 arcmin
resolution show that the hadronic and leptonic components occupy $(67\pm8)$%

have been quantified for the first time. The hadronic component is greater than
the leptonic component, which reflects the massive ISM of $\sim$10$^4$

the cosmic-ray protons. There is a marginal hint that the gamma rays are
suppressed at high gamma-ray counts which may be ascribed to the second order

spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is included in the computations, MSi$_2$N$_4$
monolayers display indirect bandgaps and large spin-split states at the $K$ and
$K'$ symmetry points at the corners of the Brillouin zone with nearly 100\%
spin polarization. The spins are locked in opposite directions along an
out-of-the-plane direction at $K$ and $K'$, leading to spin-valley coupling
effects. As expected, spin polarization is absent in the pristine bilayers due
to the presence of inversion symmetry, but it can be induced via an external
out-of-plane electric field much like the case of Mo(W)S$_2$ bilayers. A
transition from an indirect to a direct bandgap can be driven by replacing N by
As in MSi$_2$(N, As)$_4$ monolayers. Our study indicates that the MSi$_2$Z$_4$

value is used to obtain the functional form of the surface height correlation
function without initially assuming any particular form for this function
(non-parametric inversion). The input data used in validating this inversion
approach consist of in-plane and co-polarized scattering data obtained for
different forms of the correlation function by either computer simulations or
by experiments for two-dimensional randomly rough dielectric or metallic
surfaces. Good agreement was obtained between the correlation function and
surface roughness obtained during the reconstruction and the corresponding
quantities assumed when generating the input scattering data; this was the case
for both dielectric and metallic surfaces, for both p- and s-polarized light,
and for different polar angles of incidence. The proposed inversion approach
provides an accurate, efficient, robust and contact-less method based on
in-plane and co-polarized scattering data for the non-parametric
characterization of the statistical properties of isotropic two-dimensional
randomly rough dielectric and metallic surface.

Approximately between Jan 19th and Feb 5th 2021 Portugal was the country in the
world with the largest incidence rate, with 14-days incidence rates per 100,000
inhabitants in excess of 1000. Despite its importance, accurate prediction of
the geospatial evolution of COVID-19 remains a challenge, since existing
analytical methods fail to capture the complex dynamics that result from both
the contagion within a region and the spreading of the infection from infected
neighboring regions.
  We use a previously developed methodology and official municipality level
data from the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health (DGS), relative to the
first twelve months of the pandemic, to compute an estimate of the incidence
rate in each location of mainland Portugal. The resulting sequence of incidence
rate maps was then used as a gold standard to test the effectiveness of
different approaches in the prediction of the spatial-temporal evolution of the

time-discounted FIE cost function is compatible with the i-IOSS estimate. Since
for i-IOSS systems such a compatible cost function can always be designed, we
show that i-IOSS is sufficient for the existence of RGAS observers. Based on
the stability result for FIE, we provide sufficient conditions such that the
induced MHE scheme is RGAS as well for sufficiently large horizons. For both

the net $\{\chi_{F_\gamma} / |F_\gamma|\} \subset L_1(G) \subset
L_\infty^*(G)$. Thus, every accumulation point of $\{F_\gamma\}$ is a
topological left-invariant mean on $G$. The following are examples of results
proved in the present thesis:
  (1) There exists a F\o{}lner net which has as its accumulation points a set
of $2^{2^{\kappa}}$ distinct topological left-invariant means on $G$, where
$\kappa$ is the smallest cardinality of a covering of $G$ by compact subsets.
  (2) If $G$ is unimodular and $\mu$ is a topological left-invariant mean on
$G$, there exists a F\o{}lner net which has $\mu$ as its unique accumulation
point.
  (3) Suppose $L \subset G$ is a lattice subgroup. There is a natural bijection
of the left-invariant means on $L$ with the topological left-invariant means on
$G$ if and only if $G/L$ is compact.
  (4) Every topological left-invariant mean on $G$ is also topological
right-invariant if and only if $G$ has precompact conjugacy classes.
  These results lie at the intersection of functional analysis with general
topology. Problems in this area can often be solved with standard tools when
$G$ is $\sigma$-compact or metrizable, but require more interesting arguments
in the general case.

in the effective planning of breast radiotherapy. However, post-operative
breast target delineation is challenging as the contrast between the tumor bed
volume (TBV) and normal breast tissue is relatively low in CT images. In this
study, we propose to mimic the marker-guidance procedure in manual target
delineation. We developed a saliency-based deep learning segmentation (SDL-Seg)
algorithm for accurate TBV segmentation in post-operative breast irradiation.
The SDL-Seg algorithm incorporates saliency information in the form of markers'
location cues into a U-Net model. The design forces the model to encode the
location-related features, which underscores regions with high saliency levels
and suppresses low saliency regions. The saliency maps were generated by
identifying markers on CT images. Markers' locations were then converted to
probability maps using a distance-transformation coupled with a Gaussian
filter. Subsequently, the CT images and the corresponding saliency maps formed
a multi-channel input for the SDL-Seg network. Our in-house dataset was
comprised of 145 prone CT images from 29 post-operative breast cancer patients,
who received 5-fraction partial breast irradiation (PBI) regimen on GammaPod.
The performance of the proposed method was compared against basic U-Net. Our
model achieved mean (standard deviation) of 76.4 %, 6.76 mm, and 1.9 mm for
DSC, HD95, and ASD respectively on the test set with computation time of below
11 seconds per one CT volume. SDL-Seg showed superior performance relative to
basic U-Net for all the evaluation metrics while preserving low computation
cost. The findings demonstrate that SDL-Seg is a promising approach for
improving the efficiency and accuracy of the on-line treatment planning
procedure of PBI, such as GammaPod based PBI.

emergent phenomenon is addressed. Hypothetical particles are considered as
spatially confined oscillations (SCOs) and are constructed through the
superposition of plane waves. The effect of a continuously changing refractive
index (speed of propagation field) on SCOs is calculated and the continuous
Ibn-Sahl--Snell law of refraction is derived. Refracted plane wave constituents
of SCOs in an inhomogeneous medium cause the oscillation as a whole to
accelerate as an entity. This acceleration is described by a geodesic equation,
in much the same way as in general relativity. The proper time of an SCO can be
defined via its oscillation frequency. The proper time and its change along the
trajectory are equivalent to a particle in general relativity as described by
the 0th component of its geodesic equation. An SCO in an inhomogeneous
refractive index field exhibits general relativistic properties based on basic
wave mechanics. Properties derived from direct calculations are length
contraction, gravitational red- and blueshift and Thomas precession. The
presented theory is an approximation for oscillations which are small compared
to changes in the refractive index field. SCOs in an inhomogeneous medium may
thus yield a naturally emerging particle-field interaction with general
relativistic properties and may allow a useful vantage point on the nature of
gravitation using classical-wave experiments.

a resource efficient implementation of the time-triggered paradigm in
virtualized distributed real-time systems. A prerequisite of time-triggered
virtualization for hard real-time systems is providing access to a global time

clock synchronization with an upper bound on the clock synchronization

(FP) Schottky barrier diode (SBD) with a novel extreme permittivity dielectric
field oxide. A thin drift layer of 1.7 $\mu m$ was used to enable a
punch-through (PT) field profile and very low differential specific
on-resistance (R$_{on-sp}$) of 0.32 m$\Omega$-cm$^{2}$. The extreme
permittivity field plate oxide facilitated the lateral spread of the electric
field profile beyond the field plate edge and enabled a breakdown voltage
($V_{br}$) of 687 V. The edge termination efficiency increases from 13.5 $\%$
for non-field plated structure to 63 $\%$ for high permittivity field plate
structure. The surface breakdown electric field was extracted to be 5.45 MV/cm
at the center of the anode region using TCAD simulations. The high permittivity
field plated SBD demonstrated a record high Baliga figure of merit (BFOM) of
1.47 GW/cm$^{2}$ showing the potential of Ga$_2$O$_3$ power devices for
multi-kilovolt class applications.

development and validation of ICU length of stay and mortality prediction
models. The models will be used in an intelligent ICU patient monitoring module
of an Intelligent Remote Patient Monitoring (IRPM) framework that monitors the
health status of patients, and generates timely alerts, maneuver guidance, or
reports when adverse medical conditions are predicted. We utilized the publicly
available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database to
extract ICU stay data for adult patients to build two prediction models: one
for mortality prediction and another for ICU length of stay. For the mortality
model, we applied six commonly used machine learning (ML) binary classification
algorithms for predicting the discharge status (survived or not). For the
length of stay model, we applied the same six ML algorithms for binary
classification using the median patient population ICU stay of 2.64 days. For
the regression-based classification, we used two ML algorithms for predicting
the number of days. We built two variations of each prediction model: one using
12 baseline demographic and vital sign features, and the other based on our
proposed quantiles approach, in which we use 21 extra features engineered from
the baseline vital sign features, including their modified means, standard
deviations, and quantile percentages. We could perform predictive modeling with
minimal features while maintaining reasonable performance using the quantiles
approach. The best accuracy achieved in the mortality model was approximately
89% using the random forest algorithm. The highest accuracy achieved in the
length of stay model, based on the population median ICU stay (2.64 days), was
approximately 65% using the random forest algorithm.

predicting task-specific tool interactions, trained using demonstrations from
human teachers instructing a virtual robot. TANGO encodes the world state,
comprising objects and symbolic relationships between them, using a graph
neural network. The model learns to attend over the scene using knowledge of
the goal and the action history, finally decoding the symbolic action to
execute. Crucially, we address generalization to unseen environments where some
known tools are missing, but alternative unseen tools are present. We show that
by augmenting the representation of the environment with pre-trained embeddings
derived from a knowledge-base, the model can generalize effectively to novel
environments. Experimental results show a 60.5-78.9% absolute improvement over
the baseline in predicting successful symbolic plans in unseen settings for a
simulated mobile manipulator.

performances in rugby league using 59,233 plays from 180 Super League matches
via expected possession value (EPV) models. The EPV-308 split the pitch into
308 5m x 5m zones, the EPV-77 split the pitch into 77 10m x 10m zones and the
EPV-19 split the pitch in 19 zones of variable size dependent on the total zone
value generated during a match. Attacking possessions were considered as Markov
Chains, allowing the value of each zone visited to be estimated based on the
outcome of the possession. The Kullback-Leibler Divergence was used to evaluate
the reproducibility of the value generated from each zone (the reward
distribution) by teams between matches. The EPV-308 had the greatest
variability and lowest reproducibility, compared to EPV-77 and EPV-19. When six
previous matches were considered, the team's subsequent match attacking
performances had a similar reward distribution for EPV-19, EPV-77 and EPV-308
on 95 +/- 4%, 51 +/- 12% and 0 +/- 0% of occasions. This study supports the use
of EPV-19 to evaluate team attacking performance in rugby league and provides a
simple framework through which attacking performances can be compared between
teams.

minimizing risk by continuously reallocating the assets forming the portfolio.
These assets are not independent but correlated during a short time period. A
graph convolutional reinforcement learning framework called DeepPocket is
proposed whose objective is to exploit the time-varying interrelations between
financial instruments. These interrelations are represented by a graph whose
nodes correspond to the financial instruments while the edges correspond to a
pair-wise correlation function in between assets. DeepPocket consists of a
restricted, stacked autoencoder for feature extraction, a convolutional network
to collect underlying local information shared among financial instruments, and
an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent. The actor-critic structure
contains two convolutional networks in which the actor learns and enforces an
investment policy which is, in turn, evaluated by the critic in order to
determine the best course of action by constantly reallocating the various
portfolio assets to optimize the expected return on investment. The agent is
initially trained offline with online stochastic batching on historical data.
As new data become available, it is trained online with a passive concept drift
approach to handle unexpected changes in their distributions. DeepPocket is
evaluated against five real-life datasets over three distinct investment
periods, including during the Covid-19 crisis, and clearly outperformed market
indexes.

steering the student learner towards its target hypothesis, in which the
teacher has already known the student's learning parameters. Previous studies
on machine teaching focused on balancing the teaching risk and cost to find
those best teaching examples deriving the student model. This optimization
solver is in general ineffective when the student learner does not disclose any
cue of the learning parameters. To supervise such a teaching scenario, this
paper presents a distribution matching-based machine teaching strategy.
Specifically, this strategy backwardly and iteratively performs the halving
operation on the teaching cost to find a desired teaching set. Technically, our
strategy can be expressed as a cost-controlled optimization process that finds
the optimal teaching examples without further exploring in the parameter
distribution of the student learner. Then, given any a limited teaching cost,
the training examples will be closed-form. Theoretical analysis and experiment
results demonstrate this strategy.

Subsequently, we review abundant variants of KT models that consider more

field, we open source two algorithm libraries: EduData for downloading and
preprocessing KT-related datasets, and EduKTM with extensible and unified

KT cannot be separated from its applications, therefore we further present
typical KT applications in different scenarios. Finally, we discuss some

autonomous vehicle route options, each with different prices, to users. We
