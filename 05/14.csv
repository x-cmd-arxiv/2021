  Fermi-Hubbard systems on a quantum simulator","24 pages, 10 figures","PRX Quantum 2, 040325, 5 November 2021","10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040325",,"quant-ph cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.quant-gas","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum simulators have made a remarkable progress towards exploring the
dynamics of many-body systems, many of which offer a formidable challenge to
both theoretical and numerical methods. While state-of-the-art quantum
simulators are in principle able to simulate quantum dynamics well outside the
domain of classical computers, they are noisy and limited in the variability of
the initial state of the dynamics and the observables that can be measured.
Despite these limitations, here we show that such a quantum simulator can be
used to in-effect solve for the dynamics of a many-body system. We develop an
efficient numerical technique that facilitates classical simulations in regimes
not accessible to exact calculations or other established numerical techniques.
The method is based on approximations that are well suited to describe
localized one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems. Since this new method does not
have an error estimate and the approximations do not hold in general, we use a
neutral-atom Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator with $L_{\text{exp}}\simeq290$
lattice sites to benchmark its performance in terms of accuracy and convergence
for evolution times up to $700$ tunnelling times. We then use these
approximations in order to derive a simple prediction of the behaviour of
interacting Bloch oscillations for spin-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard systems, which
we show to be in quantitative agreement with experimental results. Finally, we
demonstrate that the convergence of our method is the slowest when the
entanglement depth developed in the many-body system we consider is neither too
small nor too large. This represents a promising regime for near-term
applications of quantum simulators.

satellite imagery. Overhead imagery is used by numerous industries including
agriculture, forestry, natural disaster analysis, and meteorology. Satellite
images, just as any other images, can be tampered with image manipulation
tools. Manipulation detection methods created for images captured by ""consumer
cameras"" tend to fail when used on satellite images due to the differences in
image sensors, image acquisition, and processing. In this paper we propose an
unsupervised technique that uses a Vision Transformer to detect spliced areas
within satellite images. We introduce a new dataset which includes manipulated
satellite images that contain spliced objects. We show that our proposed
approach performs better than existing unsupervised splicing detection
techniques.

shown to attain a stable evolution state corresponding to a manifold in the
space of micromechanical variables. This state is characterized by sudden
transitions between metastable jammed states, involving the partial
micromechanical rearrangement of the granular medium. Using numerical
simulations of two-dimensional granular media under quasistatic biaxial
compression, we show that the dynamics in the stable evolution state is
characterized by scale-free avalanches well before the macromechanical
stationary flow regime traditionally linked to a self-organized critical state.
This, together with the non-uniqueness and the non-monotony of macroscopic
deformation curves, suggests that the statistical avalanche properties and the
susceptibilities of the system cannot be reduced to a function of the
macromechanical state. The associated scaling exponents are non-universal and
depend on the interactions between particles. For stiffer particles (or samples
at low confining pressure) we find distributions of avalanche properties
compatible with the predictions of mean-field theory. The scaling exponents
decrease below the mean-field values for softer interactions between particles.
These lower exponents are consistent with observations for amorphous solids at
their critical point. We specifically discuss the relationship between
microscopic and macroscopic variables, including the relation between the
external stress drop and the internal potential energy released during kinetic
avalanches.

$\mathcal{E}$ equipped with a unitary connection $\nabla^{\mathcal{E}}$, we
define $\mathcal{T}^\sharp(\mathcal{E}, \nabla^{\mathcal{E}})$ as the sequence
of traces of holonomies of $\nabla^{\mathcal{E}}$ along elements of
$\mathcal{C}^\sharp$. This descends to a homomorphism on the additive moduli
space $\mathbb{A}$ of connections up to gauge $\mathcal{T}^\sharp: (\mathbb{A},
\oplus) \to \ell^\infty(\mathcal{C}^\sharp)$, which we call the
$\textit{primitive trace map}$. It is the restriction of the well-known
$\textit{Wilson loop}$ operator to primitive closed geodesics.
  The main theorem of this paper shows that the primitive trace map
$\mathcal{T}^\sharp$ is locally injective near generic points of $\mathbb{A}$
when $\dim(M) \geq 3$. We obtain global results in some particular cases: flat
bundles, direct sums of line bundles, and general bundles in negative curvature
under a spectral assumption which is satisfied in particular for connections
with small curvature. As a consequence of the main theorem, we also derive a
spectral rigidity result for the connection Laplacian.
  The proofs are based on two new ingredients: a Liv\v{s}ic-type theorem in
hyperbolic dynamical systems showing that the cohomology class of a unitary
cocycle is determined by its trace along closed primitive orbits, and a theorem
relating the local geometry of $\mathbb{A}$ with the Pollicott-Ruelle resonance
near zero of a certain natural transport operator.

  Encyclopedia of Planetary Science. Oxford University Press. Comments welcome",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Uranus provides a unique laboratory to test our understanding of planetary
atmospheres under extreme conditions. Multi-spectral observations from Voyager,
ground-based observatories, and space telescopes have revealed a delicately
banded atmosphere punctuated by storms, waves, and dark vortices, evolving
slowly under the seasonal influence of Uranus' extreme axial tilt. Condensables
like methane and hydrogen sulphide play a crucial role in shaping circulation,
clouds, and storm phenomena via latent heat release through condensation,
strong equator-to-pole gradients suggestive of equatorial upwelling and polar
subsidence, and through forming stabilising layers that may decouple different
circulation and convective regimes as a function of depth. Weak vertical mixing
and low atmospheric temperatures associated with Uranus' negligible internal
heat means that stratospheric methane photochemistry occurs in a unique
high-pressure regime, decoupled from the influx of external oxygen. The low
homopause also allows for the formation of an extensive ionosphere. Finally,
the atmosphere provides a window on the bulk composition of Uranus - the
ice-to-rock ratio, supersolar elemental and isotopic enrichments inferred from
remote sensing and future \textit{in situ} measurements - providing key
insights into its formation and subsequent migration. This review reveals the
state of our knowledge of the time-variable circulation, composition,
meteorology, chemistry, and clouds on this enigmatic `Ice Giant,' summarising
insights from more than three decades of observations, and highlighting key
questions for the next generation of planetary missions. As a
hydrogen-dominated, intermediate-sized, and chemically-enriched world, Uranus
could be our closest and best example of atmospheric processes on a class of
worlds that may dominate the census of planets beyond our own Solar System.

the simultaneous force balance equations to be solved, within a hierarchical

the displacement fields and excess forces at large distances $r$ away from the

that the thermal control experiments in~[Nature Catalysis 3, 573 (2020)] do not
separate thermal from ""hot electron"" contributions, and therefore any
conclusions drawn from these experiments are invalid. We then show that an
improved thermal control implies that the activation energy of the reaction

solely on the sample parameters provided in the original manuscript) explains
the measured data perfectly. For the sake of completeness, we also address
technical problems in the calibration of the thermal camera, an unjustifiable
disqualification of some of the measured data, as well as concerning aspects of

investigate the selectivity of the reaction, and claims about the stoichiometry

signals from compact binary coalescences detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced
Virgo during O3a, the first half of their third observing run. We study: 1) the
expected rate of lensing at current detector sensitivity and the implications
of a non-observation of strong lensing or a stochastic gravitational-wave
background on the merger-rate density at high redshift; 2) how the
interpretation of individual high-mass events would change if they were found
to be lensed; 3) the possibility of multiple images due to strong lensing by
galaxies or galaxy clusters; and 4) possible wave-optics effects due to
point-mass microlenses. Several pairs of signals in the multiple-image analysis
show similar parameters and, in this sense, are nominally consistent with the
strong lensing hypothesis. However, taking into account population priors,
selection effects, and the prior odds against lensing, these events do not
provide sufficient evidence for lensing. Overall, we find no compelling
evidence for lensing in the observed gravitational-wave signals from any of
these analyses.

the thermal equilibrium's power law in the whole time range spanning from a few
picoseconds to 3 nanoseconds. We further use the experimentally obtained
relaxation times of $M_S$ and $K$ to analyze the laser-induced precession and

standard option pricing models continue to derive option prices starting from
the joint dynamics of the underlying asset price and the spot volatility. These
models often cause difficulties: no closed formulas for prices, demanding
calibration techniques, unclear maps between spot and implied volatility.
Inspired by the practice of using implied volatility as quoting system for
option prices, models for the joint dynamics of the underlying asset price and
the implied volatility have been proposed to replace standard option pricing
models. Starting from Carr and Sun (2014), we develop a framework based on the
Implied Remaining Variance where minimal conditions for absence of arbitrage
are identified, and smile bubbles are dealt with. The key concepts arising from
the new IRV framework are those of locally consistent dynamics and sandwiched
martingale. Within the new IRV framework, the results of Schweizer and Wissel
(2008b) are reformulated, while those of El Amrani, Jacquier and Martini (2021)

which are equivalent under Gaussianity. The first one relies on normally
distributed data and the specification of second-order moments. The second
definition provided is more flexible in the sense that it allows for
considering other distributional assumptions. The statistical properties are
investigated along with the one-step linear predictors and their mean squared
errors. It is established that the process is strictly stationary under
normality and weakly stationary in the general case. Maximum likelihood and
bootstrap estimation procedures are discussed and the finite-sample behavior of
these estimates is assessed through Monte Carlo experiments. In these
simulations, both methods perform well in terms of estimation bias and standard
errors, even with relatively small sample sizes. Moreover, we show that for
non-Gaussian data, for t-Student and Generalized errors distributions, the
parameters of the model can be estimated precisely by maximum likelihood. The
proposed IMA model is compared to the continuous autoregressive moving average
(CARMA) models, exhibiting good performance. Finally, the practical application

behavior of the quench spectral functions associated to different observables

introduction to quench spectroscopy for disordered systems and show how
spectral properties can be probed using both local operators and two-point
correlation functions. We benchmark the technique using the one-dimensional
Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of a random external potential, focusing on
the low-lying excitations, and demonstrate that quench spectroscopy can
distinguish the Mott insulator, superfluid, and Bose glass phases. We then
explicitly reconstruct the zero-temperature phase diagram of the disordered

experimentally accessible via time-of-flight imaging and quantum gas microscopy
respectively, and demonstrate that quench spectroscopy can give valuable

and bridging the bandwidth gap between processor and memory have become some of
the biggest challenges. Several promising Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) such as,
Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STTRAM), Magnetic RAM (MRAM), Phase Change Memory
(PCM), Resistive RAM (RRAM) and Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM) are being
investigated to address the above issues since they offer high density and
consumes zero leakage power. On one hand, the desirable properties of emerging
NVMs make them suitable candidates for several applications including
replacement of conventional memories. On the other hand, their unique
characteristics such as, high and asymmetric read/write current and persistence
bring new threats to data security and privacy. Some of these memories are
already deployed in full systems and as discrete chips and are believed to
become ubiquitous in future computing devices. Therefore, it is of utmost
important to investigate their security and privacy issues. Note that these
NVMs can be considered for cache, main memory or storage application. They are
also suitable to implement in-memory computation which increases system
throughput and eliminates Von-Neumann Bottleneck. Compute-capable NVMs impose
new security and privacy challenges that are fundamentally different than their
storage counterpart. This work identifies NVM vulnerabilities, attack vectors
originating from device level all the way to circuits and systems considering
both storage and compute applications. We also summarize the circuit/system
level countermeasures to make the NVMs robust against security and privacy
issues.

object interaction begins, as observed from the demonstration. By then
modelling a manipulation task as a coarse, approach trajectory followed by a
fine, interaction trajectory, this state estimator can be trained in a
self-supervised manner, by automatically moving the end-effector's camera
around the object. At test time, the end-effector moves to the estimated state
through a linear path, at which point the original demonstration's end-effector
velocities are simply replayed. This enables convenient acquisition of a
complex interaction trajectory, without actually needing to explicitly learn a

learn a diverse range of skills from a single human demonstration, whilst also
yielding a stable and interpretable controller.

attractive interaction potential, constitute a relatively simple model with
highly non-trivial glassy dynamics. The mode-coupling theory of the glass
transition (MCT) offers a qualitative account of the complex reentrant dynamics
of sticky hard spheres, but the predicted glass transition point is notoriously
underestimated. Here we apply an improved first-principles-based theory,
referred to as generalized mode-coupling theory (GMCT), to sticky hard spheres.
This theoretical framework seeks to go beyond MCT by hierarchically expanding
the dynamics in higher-order density correlation functions -- an approach that
may become exact if sufficiently many correlations are taken into account. We
predict the phase diagrams from the first few levels of the GMCT hierarchy and
the dynamics-related critical exponents, all of which are much closer to the
empirical observations than MCT. Notably, the prominent reentrant glassy
dynamics, the glass-glass transition, and the higher-order bifurcation
singularity classes ($A_3$ and $A_4$) of sticky hard spheres are found to be
preserved within GMCT at arbitrary order. Moreover, we demonstrate that when
the hierarchical order of GMCT increases, the effect of the short-ranged
attractive interactions becomes more evident in the dynamics. This implies that
GMCT is more sensitive to subtle microstructural differences than MCT, and that
the framework provides a promising first-principles approach to systematically
go beyond the MCT regime.

visual fixation) in 26 participants' EEGs. We compared the connectivity
networks estimated using SCAU with respect to a VAR model. SCAU networks show a
clear contrast for both stimuli while the magnitude links also denoted a low
variance in comparison with the VAR networks. Furthermore, SCAU dependency
connections not only were consistent with findings in the neuroscience

established between the environment and the reference, even though they do not

system-environment evolution has a zero unconditional entropy production.
However, one can still have a nonzero conditional entropy production with

additional contribution to the conditional entropy production, the dissipative

particle orbits, have a well-known formulation as a dynamical system in
coordinates adapted to the timelike hypersurface containing the geodesic. For
equatorial geodesics, the resulting dynamical system is shown to possess a
conserved angular quantity and two conserved temporal quantities, whose
properties and physical meaning are analogues of the conserved
Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector, and its variant known as the eccentricity vector, in
Newtonian gravity. When a particle orbit is projected into the spatial
equatorial plane, the angular quantity yields the coordinate angle at which the
orbit has either a turning point (where the radial velocity is zero) or a
centripetal point (where the radial acceleration is zero). This is the same
property as the angle of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz/eccentricity vector in the
plane of motion. The temporal quantities yield the coordinate time and the
proper time at which those points are reached on the orbit. In general, for
orbits that have a single turning point, the three quantities are globally
constant; for orbits that possess more than one turning point, the temporal
quantities are just locally constant as they jump at every successive turning
point, while the angular quantity similarly jumps only if an orbit is
precessing. This is analogous to the properties of a generalized

several merits. (1) It simultaneously trains and prunes CNNs from scratch in a

verification of concurrent programs. As scheduling non-determinism creates
exponentially large spaces of thread interleavings, SMC attempts to partition
this space into equivalence classes and explore only a few representatives from
each class. The efficiency of this approach depends on two factors: (a) the
coarseness of the partitioning, and (b) the time to generate representatives in
each class. For this reason, the search for coarse partitionings that are
efficiently explorable is an active research challenge.
  In this work we present RVF-SMC, a new SMC algorithm that uses a novel
\emph{reads-value-from (RVF)} partitioning. Intuitively, two interleavings are
deemed equivalent if they agree on the value obtained in each read event, and
read events induce consistent causal orderings between them. The RVF
partitioning is provably coarser than recent approaches based on Mazurkiewicz
and ""reads-from"" partitionings. Our experimental evaluation reveals that RVF is
quite often a very effective equivalence, as the underlying partitioning is
exponentially coarser than other approaches. Moreover, RVF-SMC generates
representatives very efficiently, as the reduction in the partitioning is often
met with significant speed-ups in the model checking task.

degree 4, weight 2 motivic cohomology group of the classifying space BG of G is
identified with Z. We construct cocycles representing the generator of this
group, known as the second universal motivic Chern class.
  If G = SL(m), there is a canonical cocycle, defined by the first author
(1993). For any group G, we define a collection of cocycles parametrised by
cluster coordinate systems on the space of G-orbits on the cube of the
principal affine space G/U. Cocycles for different clusters are related by
explicit coboundaries, constructed using cluster transformations relating the
clusters.
  The cocycle has three components. The construction of the last one is
canonical and elementary; it does not use clusters, and provides a canonical
cocycle for the motivic generator of the degree 3 cohomology class of the
complex manifold G(C). However to lift this component to the whole cocycle we
need cluster coordinates: the construction of the first two components uses
crucially the cluster structure of the moduli spaces A(G,S) related to the
moduli space of G-local systems on S. In retrospect, it partially explains why
the cluster coordinates on the space A(G,S) should exist.
  This construction has numerous applications, including an explicit
construction of the universal extension of the group G by K_2, the line bundle
on Bun(G) generating its Picard group, Kac-Moody groups, etc. Another
application is an explicit combinatorial construction of the second motivic
Chern class of a G-bundle. It is a motivic analog of the work of
Gabrielov-Gelfand-Losik (1974), for any G. We show that the cluster
construction of the measurable group 3-cocycle for the group G(C) gives rise to
its quantum deformation.

backgrounds -- can be efficiently removed by zone refining. However, zone
refining has never been demonstrated for ultra-high purity NaI which became
commercially available recently. In this article, we show that many common
metallic impurities can be efficiently removed via zone refining. A numerical
model for predicting the final impurity distribution was developed and used to
fit the ICP-MS measurement data to determine the segregation coefficient and
the initial concentration. Under this scheme, the segregation coefficient for K
is estimated to be 0.57, indicating that zone refining is still effective in
removing K from ultra-high purity NaI. As zone refining tends to move the
impurities to one end, elements with concentrations too low to be measured
directly in the unprocessed powder can potentially be detected in the end due
to the enrichment. We also present an analysis technique to estimate the
initial concentrations of impurities with partial data, which effectively
enhances the sensitivity of the spectrometer. Using this technique, the initial
concentration of $^{85}$Rb is estimated to be between 5 ppt and 14 ppt at 90%

for estimating causal effect, but they may lack external validity when the

target population requires covariates to capture all treatment effect modifiers
that are shifted between the two sets. Standard estimators then use either
weighting (IPSW), outcome modeling (G-formula), or combine the two in doubly

both sets. In this paper, after proving L1-consistency of these three
estimators, we compute the expected bias induced by a missing covariate,
assuming a Gaussian distribution, a continuous outcome, and a semi-parametric
model. Under this setting, we perform a sensitivity analysis for each missing
covariate pattern and compute the sign of the expected bias. We also show that

either in the RSG envelope or core. The total energy of the event, radiation
and kinetic, is >10^{52}erg. The light curve stays luminous for months to years
and a signal of gravitational waves might be detected. The ejecta contains
freshly synthesized r-process elements not only from the NS-NS merger as in
kilonova events, but possibly also from the pre-merger jets that the NSs launch
inside the core, as in the r-process CEJSN scenario. This scenario shortens the

the problem of the NS-NS r-process scenario to account for r-process

engineered nature of these approaches which often rely on auxiliary losses and
intermediate steps such as mask generators. In this note, we present an
orthogonal approach to this task, where the generative model is based on pure

a powerful compression model with adversarial training which learns to
reconstruct its inputs via a discrete latent bottleneck and thereby effectively
strips the latent representation of high-frequency details such as texture.
Subsequently, we train an autoregressive transformer model to learn the
distribution of the discrete image representations conditioned on a tokenized
version of the layouts. Our experiments show that the resulting system is able
to synthesize high-quality images consistent with the given layouts. In
particular, we improve the state-of-the-art FID score on COCO-Stuff and on

learning by a large margin. The core among these methods is intra-image
invariance learning. Two different transformations of one image instance are
considered as a positive sample pair, where various tasks are designed to learn
invariant representations by comparing the pair. Analogically, for video data,
representations of frames from the same video are trained to be closer than
frames from other videos, i.e. intra-video invariance. However, cross-video
relation has barely been explored for visual representation learning. Unlike
intra-video invariance, ground-truth labels of cross-video relation is usually
unavailable without human labors. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive
learning method which explores the cross-video relation by using
cycle-consistency for general image representation learning. This allows to
collect positive sample pairs across different video instances, which we

of a category-level NeRF - also known as a conditional radiance field - trained
on a shape category. Specifically, we introduce a method for propagating coarse
2D user scribbles to the 3D space, to modify the color or shape of a local
region. First, we propose a conditional radiance field that incorporates new
modular network components, including a shape branch that is shared across
object instances. Observing multiple instances of the same category, our model
learns underlying part semantics without any supervision, thereby allowing the
propagation of coarse 2D user scribbles to the entire 3D region (e.g., chair
seat). Next, we propose a hybrid network update strategy that targets specific
network components, which balances efficiency and accuracy. During user
interaction, we formulate an optimization problem that both satisfies the
user's constraints and preserves the original object structure. We demonstrate
our approach on various editing tasks over three shape datasets and show that
it outperforms prior neural editing approaches. Finally, we edit the appearance
and shape of a real photograph and show that the edit propagates to
extrapolated novel views.

the properties of the brightest streams progenitors (BSPs). We find that BSPs
are accreted within a broad range of infall times, from 1.6 to 10 Gyr ago, with
only 25 percent accreted within the last 5 Gyrs; thus most BSPs correspond to
relatively early accretion events. We also find that 37 percent of the BSPs
survive to the present day. The median infall times for surviving and disrupted
BSPs are 5.6 and 6.7 Gyr, respectively. We find a clear relation between infall

Published version",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.105.205122",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Focusing on the implications of recent experiments on Majorana zero modes in
semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) heterostructures, we critically examine
the quantization of the zero-bias differential conductance as a possible
unambiguous signature of Majorana physics in the presence of disorder. By
numerically calculating the zero-bias conductance (ZBC) maps as function of
Zeeman splitting and chemical potential for different disorder realizations, we
show that the presence of quantized ""islands"" characterized by a ZBC value
(approximately) equal to $2e^2/h$ and having a finite area/volume in a
multi-dimensional parameter space represents a unique signature of Majorana
physics supporting Majorana zero modes (MZMs) or partially-separated Majorana
modes (ps-MMs). We find that in the presence of strong disorder Majorana
physics only emerges locally and gives rise to ps-MMs, which, in turn, generate
small quantized islands when one of the Majorana modes is located at the end of
the system. Observing these small islands may require sample selection and the
systematic scanning of a large volume in the control parameter space. Upon
decreasing disorder, the quantized islands increase in size and eventually
coalesce into large topological regions. Since the presence of MZMs localized
at the opposite ends of the system is typically associated with large quantized
islands, looking for MZM-induced edge-to-edge correlations is premature in the
absence of convincing experimental evidence for (even small) quantized islands.
We conclude that the observation of quantized islands demonstrates
unambiguously the presence of the key ingredients necessary for Majorana
physics, provides an excellent diagnostic tool for evaluating the disorder
strength, and, consequently, represents the next natural milestone in the
Majorana search.

accretion of refractory elements at rates $\sim10^3$--$10^7$ kg s$^{-1}$, among
which, 37 WDs were detected to harbor dusty debris disks. Such a concurrence
requires not only fertile reservoirs of planetary material, but also a high
duty cycle of metal delivery. It has been commonly suggested that this material
could be supplied by Solar System analogs of Main Belt asteroids or Kuiper Belt
objects. Here we consider the primary progenitors of WD pollutants as a
population of residual high-eccentricity planetesimals, de-volatilized during
the stellar giant phases. Equivalent to the Solar System's long-period comets,
they are scattered to the proximity of WDs by perturbations from remaining
planets, Galactic tides, passing molecular clouds, and nearby stars. These
objects undergo downsizing when they venture within the tidal disruption limit.
We show quantitatively how the breakup condition and fragment sizes are
determined by material strength and gravity. Thereafter, the fragments'
semi-major axes need to decay by at least $\sim$6 orders of magnitude before
their constituents are eventually accreted onto the surface of WDs. We
investigate the orbital evolution of these fragments around WDs and show that
WDs' magnetic fields induce an Alfv\'en-wave drag during their periastron
passages and rapidly circularize their orbits. This process could be
responsible for the observed accretion rates of heavy-elements and the
generation of circum-WD debris disks. A speculative implication is that giant
planets may be common around WDs' progenitors and they may still be bound to
some WDs today.

to the trapping regime converts axions and dark photons into each other. Thus,
if one of the two new particles is sufficiently massive, both production and
scattering become suppressed and the bounds from bulk emission and trapped
(area) emission both weaken exponentially and do not intersect. The other
unusual feature occurs because for light dark photons, longitudinal modes
couple more weakly than transverse modes do. Since the longitudinal mode is
more weakly coupled, it can still cause excessive cooling even if the
transverse mode is trapped. Thus, the supernova constraints for massive dark
photons look like two independent supernova bounds super-imposed on top of each
other.

protoplanetary disks and they likely affect planet formation. Typical methods
to study the magnetic field morphology observe the polarization of dust or
spectral lines. However, it has recently become clear that dust-polarization in
ALMA's spectral regime does not always faithfully trace the magnetic field
structure of protoplanetary disks, which leaves spectral line polarization as a
promising method for mapping the magnetic field morphologies of such sources.
We aim to model the emergent polarization of different molecular lines in the
ALMA wavelength regime that are excited in protoplanetary disks. We explore a
variety of disk models and molecules to identify those properties that are
conducive to the emergence of polarization in spectral lines and may therefore
be viably used for magnetic field measurements in protoplanetary disks. We used
PORTAL in conjunction with LIME. Together, they allowed us to treat the
polarized line radiative transfer of complex three-dimensional physical and
magnetic field structures. We present simulations of the emergence of spectral
line polarization of different molecules and molecular transitions in the ALMA
wavelength regime. We find that molecules that thermalize at high densities,
such as HCN, are also the most susceptible to polarization. We find that such
molecules are expected to be significantly polarized in protoplanetary disks,
while molecules that thermalize at low densities, such as CO, are only
significantly polarized in the outer disk regions. We present the simulated
polarization maps at a range of inclinations and magnetic field morphologies,

of identical elements and one with a single additional one? Usually, the answer
to this question is negative but, in this work, we show that in
antiferromagnetic quantum spin rings a simple out-of-equilibrium experiment can
do so, yielding two qualitatively and quantitatively different outcomes
depending on whether the system includes an even or an odd number of elements.
We consider a local quantum-quench setup and calculate a generating function of
the work done, namely, the Loschmidt echo, showing that it displays different
features depending on the presence or absence of topological frustration, which
is triggered by the even/oddness in the number of the chain sites. We employ
the prototypical quantum Ising chain to illustrate this phenomenology, which we
argue being generic for antiferromagnetic spin chains, as it stems primarily
from the different low energy spectra of frustrated and non frustrated chains.
Our results thus prove that these well-known spectral differences lead indeed
to distinct observable characteristics and open the way to harvest them in
quantum thermodynamics protocols.

absorbers (DLAs) have detected bright galaxies at distances of tens of kpc from
the DLA. Using the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom simulations, we argue that these
relatively large distances are due to a predominantly cool and neutral inner
circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding high-redshift galaxies. The inner CGM
is cool because of the short cooling time of hot gas in $\lesssim10^{12}$ Msun
halos, which implies that accretion and feedback energy are radiated quickly,
while it is neutral due to the high volume densities and column densities at
high redshift which shield cool gas from photoionization. Our analysis predicts
large DLA covering factors ($\gtrsim50\%$) out to impact parameters $\sim0.3((1
+ z)/5)^{3/2}\ R_{\rm vir}$ from the central galaxies at $z > 1$, equivalent to
a physical distance of $\sim 21 M_{12}^{1/3} ((1 + z)/5)^{1/2}$ kpc ($R_{\rm
vir}$ and $M_{12}$ are the halo virial radius and mass in units of $10^{12}$
Msun, respectively). This implies that DLA covering factors at $z \sim 4$ may
be comparable to unity out to a distance $\sim 10$ times larger than stellar
half-mass radii. A predominantly neutral inner CGM in the early universe
suggests that its mass and metallicity can be directly constrained by CGM
absorption surveys, without resorting to large ionization corrections as
required for ionized CGM.

We find that, although the boundary effects strongly impact the photonic

systems are still predominant, the interest in NoSQL systems is continuously
increasing. In this scenario, polyglot persistence is envisioned as the
database architecture to be prevalent in the future.
  Multi-model database tools normally use a generic or unified metamodel to
represent schemas of the data model that they support. Such metamodels
facilitate developing utilities, as they can be built on a common
representation. Also, the number of mappings required to migrate databases from
a data model to another is reduced, and integrability is favored.
  In this paper, we present the U-Schema unified metamodel able to represent
logical schemas for the four most popular NoSQL paradigms (columnar, document,
key-value, and graph) as well as relational schemas. We will formally define
the mappings between U-Schema and the data model defined for each paradigm. How
these mappings have been implemented and validated will be discussed, and some
applications of U-Schema will be shown.
  To achieve flexibility to respond to data changes, most of NoSQL systems are
""schema-on-write,"" and the declaration of schemas is not required. Such an
absence of schema declaration makes structural variability possible, i.e.,
stored data of the same entity type can have different structure. Moreover,
data relationships supported by each data model are different. We will show how
all these issues have been tackled in our approach.
  Our metamodel goes beyond the existing proposals by distinguishing entity
types and relationship types, representing aggregation and reference
relationships, and including the notion of structural variability. Our
contributions also include developing schema extraction strategies for
schemaless systems of each NoSQL data model, and tackling performance and
scalability in the implementation for each store.

empirical risk minimization oracle (without any constraints). Empirically, we
demonstrate that our algorithm is superior to state of the art agnostic active

controller that is capable of solving the trajectory tracking problem of a
nonholonomic mobile robot under longitudinal and lateral slip. While the
controller can effectively compensate for the longitudinal slip, the lateral
slip is a more involved problem to deal with, since nonholonomic robots cannot

properties of materials. For weakly interacting two-dimensional (2D) electron
or hole systems, electron-electron interactions are known to introduce quantum
corrections to the Drude conductivity in the FL theory, giving rise to
temperature dependent conductivity and magneto-resistance. Here we study the
magneto-transport in a strongly interacting 2D hole system over a broad range
of temperatures ($T$ = 0.09 to $>$1K) and densities $p=1.98-0.99\times10^{10}$
cm$^{-2}$ where the ratio between Coulomb energy and Fermi energy $r_s$ = 20 -
30. We show that while the system exhibits a negative parabolic
magneto-resistance at low temperatures ($\lesssim$ 0.4K) characteristic of an
interacting FL, the FL interaction corrections represent an insignificant
fraction of the total conductivity. Surprisingly, a positive magneto-resistance
emerges at high temperatures and grows with increasing temperature even in the
regime $T \sim E_F$, close to the Fermi temperature. This unusual positive
magneto-resistance at high temperatures is attributed to the collective viscous
transport of 2D hole fluid in the hydrodynamic regime where holes scatter
frequently with each other. These findings highlight the collective transport
in a strongly interacting 2D system in the $r_s\gg 1$ regime and the
hydrodynamic transport induced magneto-resistance opens up possibilities to new
routes of magneto-resistance at high temperatures.

Schwarzschild radius is comparable to, or smaller than, the neutron's de
Broglie wavelength. In this case, quantum mechanical aspects of the accretion
process cannot be neglected, and give rise to a completely different accretion
rate. We show that for the case of black holes seeded by the collapse of
bosonic dark matter, this is the case for electroweak-scale dark matter
particles. In the case of fermionic dark matter, typically the black holes that
would form at the center of a neutron star are more massive, unless the dark
matter particle mass is very large, larger than about 10$^{10}$ GeV. We
calculate the lifetime of neutron stars harboring a ``small'' black hole, and
find that black holes lighter than $\sim 10^{11}$ kg quickly evaporate, leaving
no trace. More massive black holes destroy neutron stars via quantum accretion
on time-scales much shorter than the age of observed neutron stars. We find
that the range where seed black holes inside neutron stars are massive enough
that they do not quickly evaporate away, but not so massive that a fluid
accretion picture is warranted is limited to between $\sim10^{11}$ and

the outflow such as shock interfaces and the jet-cocoon interface. Our results

significant growth in recent years and it is expected to be a growing market

which shall describe the coarse-grained time evolution of a system consisting
of a large number of particles which interact by Coulomb or Newton's
gravitational force. Although major progress concerning a rigorous
justification of such an approach was made recently, there are still
substantial steps necessary to obtain a completely convincing result. The main
goal of this work is to yield further progress in this regard. \\ To this end,
we consider on the one hand $N$-dependent forces $f^N$ (where $N$ shall denote
the particle number) which converge pointwise to Coulomb or alternatively
Newton`s gravitational force. More precisely, the interaction fulfills
$f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^3}$ for $|q|>N^{-\frac{7}{18}+\epsilon}$ and has a
cut-off at $|q|= N^{-\frac{7}{18}+\epsilon}$ where $\epsilon>0$ can be chosen
arbitrarily small. We prove that under certain assumptions on the initial
density $k_0$ the characteristics of Vlasov equation provide typically a very
good approximation of the $N$-particle trajectories if their initial positions
are i.i.d. with respect to density $k_0$. Interestingly, the cut-off diameter
is of smaller order than the average distance of a particle to its nearest
neighbor. Nevertheless, the cut-off is essential for the success of the applied
approach and thus we consider additionally less singular forces scaling like
$|f(q)|=\frac{1}{|q|^\alpha}$ where $\alpha\in (1,\frac{4}{3}]$. In this case
we are able to show a corresponding result even without any regularization.
Although such forces are distinctly less interesting than for instance Coulomb
interaction from a physical perspective, the introduced ideas for dealing with
forces where even the related potential is singular might still be helpful for
attaining comparable results for the arguably most interesting case $\alpha=2$.

total sunspot areas AR - physically-based index of sunspot activity. We used
telescopic observations of the AR index in 1832-1868 and 1875-2020, as well as
the relationship between AR and long series of sunspot indices SN (ISN version
2.0) and sunspot groups GN (Svalgaard and Schatten (2016) GSN version). The
Royal Greenwich observatory series after 1976 is extended by the Kislovodsk
Mountain Astronomical Station data. When reconstructing AR from SN, it is taken
into account that the function AR = f (SN) has a nonlinear systematic character
and uncertainty associated with the heterogeneity of these indices. Therefore,
in addition to modeling the most probable AR values, predictive limits of
reconstruction uncertainty are determined. In the interval 1610-1699 the
reconstruction we carried out on the basis of the GN series using the
previously proposed decomposition in pseudo-phase space method (DPS). The
resulting series NO21y is freely available online. We show that for this series
the empirical Gnevyshev-Ohl rule and Waldmeier effect are fulfilled. Wavelet
analysis reveals periodicities of 8.4-13.8 years for the main cycle (with a
sharp decrease of the period before the global Maunder and Dalton minima) and a
two-component Gleissberg cycle with typical periods of 50-60 years and 90-110
years.

outflux $\langle T_{uu}\rangle$ and the influx $\langle T_{vv}\rangle$ ($u$ and
$v$ being the standard null Eddington coordinates), at the inner horizon (IH)
of a Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole (BH) of mass $M$ and charge $Q$, in the
near-extremal domain in which $Q/M$ approaches $1$. We consider a
minimally-coupled massless quantum scalar field, in both Hartle-Hawking ($H$)
and Unruh ($U$) states, the latter corresponding to an evaporating BH. The
near-extremal domain lends itself to an analytical treatment which sheds light
on the behavior of various quantities on approaching extremality. We explore
the behavior of the three near-IH flux quantities $\langle T_{uu}^-\rangle^U$,
$\langle T_{vv}^-\rangle^U$, and $\langle T_{uu}^-\rangle^H=\langle
T_{vv}^-\rangle^H$, as a function of the small parameter
$\Delta\equiv\sqrt{1-(Q/M)^2}$ (where the superscript ""$-$"" refers to the IH
value). We find that in the near-extremal domain $\langle
T_{uu}^-\rangle^U\cong\langle T_{uu}^-\rangle^H=\langle T_{vv}^-\rangle^H$
behaves as $\propto\Delta^5$. In contrast, $\langle T_{vv}^-\rangle^U$ behaves
as $\propto\Delta^4$, and we calculate the prefactor analytically. It therefore
follows that the semiclassical fluxes at the IH neighborhood of an evaporating
near-extremal spherical charged BH are dominated by the influx $\langle
T_{vv}\rangle^U$. In passing, we also find an analytical expression for the
transmission coefficient outside a Reissner-Nordstr\""om BH to leading order in
small frequencies (which turns out to be a crucial ingredient of our
near-extremal analysis). Furthermore, we explicitly obtain the near-extremal
Hawking-evaporation rate ($\propto\Delta^4$), with an analytical expression for
the prefactor (obtained here for the first time to the best of our knowledge).

46 transit depths measured to an averaged precision of 220 parts per million
(ppm) over an averaged 80\AA~bin for a Vmag=12.8 star. The measured transit
depths are unaffected by a dilution from a close A-type field dwarf, which was
fully resolved. The overall main characteristic of the transmission spectrum is
an increasing radius with wavelength and a lack of the theoretically predicted
pressure-broadened sodium and potassium absorption features for a cloud-free
atmosphere. We analyze archival high-resolution optical spectroscopy and find
evidence for low to moderate activity of the host star, which we take into
account in the atmospheric retrieval analysis. Using the AURA retrieval code,
we find that the observed transmission spectrum can be best explained by a

masses naturally by the exchange of its spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 components. This
one-step seesaw mechanism, which we call Type-3/2 seesaw, keeps the Higgs boson
mass unchanged at one loop, and gives cause therefore to no fine-tuning

becomes a potential candidate for hidden dark matter diluting due only to the

the neutrino, Higgs boson and dark matter sectors, with overall agreement with

Associations are more variable for abstract concepts, variability is
represented as uncertainty within each individual, and uncertainty enables
accurate predictions about whether others are likely to share the same

these representations for communication. Accuracy is initially low when

Probe (PSP) in-situ measurements in the first five encounters. These structures
are detected at heliocentric distances, ranging from 0.13 to 0.66 au, in a
total of 4-month time period. We find that flux ropes with field-aligned flows,
although occur more frequently, have certain properties similar to those of
static flux ropes, such as the decaying relations of the magnetic fields within
structures with respect to heliocentric distances. Moreover, these events are
more likely with magnetic pressure dominating over the thermal pressure. About
one-third of events are detected in the relatively fast-speed solar wind.
Taking into account the high Alfvenicity, we also compare with switchback
spikes identified during three encounters and interpret their inter-relations.
We find that some switchbacks can be detected when the spacecraft traverses
flux rope-like structures. The cross-section maps for selected events are
presented via the new Grad-Shafranov type reconstruction. Finally, the possible

environment with an unknown, state-dependent disturbance function while
avoiding some forbidden areas. The goal of the robot is to safely collect
observations of the disturbance and construct an accurate estimate of the
underlying disturbance function. We use Gaussian Process (GP) to get an
estimate of the disturbance from data with a high-confidence bound on the
regression error. Furthermore, we use neural Contraction Metrics to derive a
tracking controller and the corresponding high-confidence uncertainty tube
around the nominal trajectory planned for the robot, based on the estimate of
the disturbance. From the robustness of the Contraction Metric, error bound can
be pre-computed and used by the motion planner such that the actual trajectory
is guaranteed to be safe. As the robot collects more and more observations
along its trajectory, the estimate of the disturbance becomes more and more
accurate, which in turn improves the performance of the tracking controller and
enlarges the free space that the robot can safely explore. We evaluate the
proposed method using a carefully designed environment with a ground vehicle.
Results show that with the proposed method the robot can thoroughly explore the
environment safely and quickly.

using five-band (grizy) optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program. An automated analysis tool is used to forward-model the
blended emission of the quasar as characterized by the point spread function
and the underlying host galaxy as a two-dimensional Sersic profile. In
agreement with previous studies, quasars are preferentially hosted by massive
star-forming galaxies with disk-like light profiles. Furthermore, we find that
the size distribution of quasar hosts is broad at a given stellar mass and the
average values exhibit a size-stellar mass relation as seen with inactive
galaxies. In contrast, the sizes of quasar hosts are more compact than inactive
star-forming galaxies on average, but not as compact as quiescent galaxies of
similar stellar masses. This is true irrespective of quasar properties
including bolometric luminosity, Eddington ratio, and black hole mass. These
results are consistent with a scenario in which galaxies are concurrently
fueling a SMBH and building their stellar bulge from a centrally-concentrated
gas reservoir. Alternatively, quasar hosts may be experiencing a compaction
process in which stars from the disk and inflowing gas are responsible for
growing the bulge. In addition, we confirm that the host galaxies of type-1
quasars have a bias of being closer towards face-on, suggesting that
galactic-scale dust can contribute to obscuring the broad-line region.

feature infrared divergences similar to those of a theory at a critical point,
motivating a renormalization group improvement of the propagator that yields a

confirms this decay, yields the dressed state and determines that the anomalous

density at threshold independent of the ultraviolet behavior, suggesting
certain universality for infrared phenomena. The dressed state is an entangled
state of the charged and massless quanta. The entanglement entropy is obtained
by tracing over the unobserved massless quanta. Its time evolution is
determined by the (DRM), it is infrared finite and describes the information

relevant mathematical formulas and propose efficient algorithms, drawing upon
powerful techniques in computational geometry and the literature on splines, to
compute the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function,
and the k-th moment of the probability function. Our algorithmic tools and
implementations efficiently handle portfolios with 10000 assets, and compute
moments of order k up to 40 in a few seconds, thus handling real-life
scenarios. We focus on the long-only strategy which is the most common type of
investment, i.e. on portfolios whose weights are non-negative and sum up to 1;
our approach is readily generalizable. Thus, we leverage a geometric
representation of the stock market, where the investment set defines a simplex
polytope. The cumulative distribution function corresponds to a portfolio score
capturing the percentage of portfolios yielding a return not exceeding a given
value. We introduce closed-form analytic formulas for the first 4 moments of
the cross-sectional returns distribution, as well as a novel algorithm to
compute all higher moments. We show that the first 4 moments are a direct
mapping of the asset returns' moments. All of our algorithms and solutions are
fully general and include the special case of equal asset returns, which was
sometimes excluded in previous works. Finally, we apply our portfolio score in
the design of new performance measures and asset management. We found our
score-based optimal portfolios less concentrated than the mean-variance
portfolio and much less risky in terms of ranking.

Control (AC) in the inner loop and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based policy
in the outer loop is proposed such that in real-time the inner-loop AC
contracts the closed-loop dynamics towards a reference system, and as the
contraction takes hold, the RL in the outerloop directs the overall system
towards optimal performance. Two classes of nonlinear dynamic systems are
considered, both of which are control-affine. The first class of dynamic
systems utilizes equilibrium points with expansion forms around these points
and employs a Lyapunov approach while second class of nonlinear systems uses
contraction theory. AC-RL controllers are proposed for both classes of systems
and shown to lead to online policies that guarantee stability using a
high-order tuner and accommodate parametric uncertainties and magnitude limits
on the input. In addition to establishing a stability guarantee with real-time
control, the AC-RL controller is also shown to lead to parameter learning with
persistent excitation for the first class of systems. Numerical validations of
all algorithms are carried out using a quadrotor landing task on a moving

surface formula and entanglement island. We study an AdS black hole coupled to
a bath with generic dynamics, and ask whether it is possible to retrieve
information about a small perturbation in the interior from the bath system. We
derive a state reconstruction formula based on one norm. However, we show that
a contradiction arises if we apply this result to a special situation when the
bath dynamics includes a unitary operation that carries a particular
measurement to a region $A$ and send the result to another region $W$.
Physically, the contradiction arises between transferability of classical
information during the measurement, and non-transferability of quantum
information which determines the entanglement island. We propose that the
resolution of the contradiction is to realize that the state reconstruction
formula does not apply to the special situation involving
interior-information-retrieving measurements. This implies that the assumption
of smooth replica AdS geometry with boundary condition set by the flat space
bath has to break down when the particular measurement operator is applied to
the bath. Using replica trick, we introduce an explicitly construction of such
operator, which we name as ""miracle operators"". From this construction we see
that the smooth replica geometry assumption breaks down because we have to
introduce extra replica wormholes connecting with the ""simulated blackholes""

electrical dynamics and focuses on the torque-speed dynamics. By contrast,
analysis of the emergent IBR-dominated grid usually takes the
electrical-centric view which focuses on the voltage-current interaction. In
this article, a port-mapping method is proposed to fill the gap between these

dynamics are mapped to the electrical impedance seen at the electrical port;
and the electrical dynamics are also mapped to the torque coefficient seen at
the mechanical port. The bidirectional mapping gives additional flexibility and

in graphene quasicrystal and $D_6$ twisted BG show two remarkable

relatively large energy difference between Dirac bands from top and bottom

hybridization strength with stronger interlayer coupling for holes, which
arises from the non-nearest-neighbor interlayer hoppings and the wave-function

direct imaging and characterization of extrasolar planets and planetary
systems. Directly imaging exoplanets from ground-based observatories requires
combining high-order adaptive optics with a stellar coronagraph observing at
wavelengths ranging from the visible to the mid-IR. A limiting factor in
achieving the required contrast (planet-to-star intensity ratio) is
quasi-static speckles, caused largely by non-common path aberrations (NCPA) in
the coronagraph. Starting with a realistic simulator of a telescope with an AO
system and a coronagraph, this article provides simulations of several closely
related millisecond regression models requiring inputs of the measured
wavefronts and science camera images. The simplest regression model, called the
naive estimator, does not treat the noise and other sources of information loss
in the WFS. The naive estimator provided a useful estimate of the NCPA of
$\sim$ 0.5 radian RMS, with an accuracy of $\sim$ 0.06 radian RMS in one minute
of simulated sky time on a magnitude 8 star. The bias-corrected estimator
generalizes the regression model to account for the noise and information loss
in the WFS. A simulation of the bias-corrected estimator with four minutes of
sky time included an NCPA of $\sim 0.05 \,$ radian RMS and an extended
exoplanet scene. The joint regression of the bias-corrected estimator
simultaneously achieved an NCPA estimate with an accuracy of $\sim
5\times10^{-3} \,$radian and contrast of $\sim 10^{-5}$ on the exoplanet scene.
In addition, the estimate of the exoplanet image was completely free of the
subtraction artifacts that always plague differential imaging. The estimate of
the exoplanet image obtained by the joint regression was nearly identical to
the image obtained by subtraction of a perfectly known point-spread function.

exoplanets and associated structures (eg. protoplanetary disks) at wavelengths
ranging from the visible to the infrared are quasi-static speckles, and they
are hard to distinguish from planets at the necessary level of precision. The
source of the quasi-static speckles is hardware aberrations that are not
compensated by the adaptive optics system. These aberrations are called
non-common path aberrations (NCPA). In 2013, Frazin showed how, in principle,
simultaneous millisecond (ms) telemetry from the wavefront sensor (WFS) and the
science camera behind a stellar coronagraph can be used as input into a
regression scheme that simultaneously and self-consistently estimates the NCPA
and the sought-after image of the planetary system (the exoplanet image). The
physical principle underlying the regression method is rather simple: the
wavefronts, which are measured by the WFS, modulate the speckles caused by the
NCPA and therefore can be used as probes of the optical system. The most
important departure from realism in the author's 2013 article was the
assumption that the WFS made error-free measurements. The simulations in Part I
provide results on the joint regression on the NCPA and the exoplanet image
from three different methods, called the ideal, the naive, and the
bias-corrected estimators. The ideal estimator is not physically realizable but
is a useful as a benchmark for simulation studies, but the other two are, at
least in principle. This article provides the regression equations for all
three of these estimators as well as a supporting technical discussion.
Briefly, the naive estimator simply uses the noisy WFS measurements without any
attempt to account for the errors, and the bias-corrected estimator uses
statistical knowledge of the wavefronts to treat errors in the WFS
measurements.

we first estimate the relative camera orientations and then generate 3D poses
via triangulation. The triangulation is only applied to the views with high 2D
human joint confidence. The generated 3D poses are then used to train a
recurrent lifting network (RLN) that estimates 3D poses from 2D poses. We
further apply a multi-view re-projection loss to the estimated 3D poses and
enforce the 3D poses estimated from multi-views to be consistent. Therefore,
our method relaxes the constraints in practice, only multi-view videos are
required for training, and is thus convenient for in-the-wild settings. At
inference, RLN merely requires single-view videos. The proposed method
outperforms previous works on two challenging datasets, Human3.6M and

that considering our combined problems is essentially different from

companion star to a compact object in an X-ray binary. The accretion ring is a
place where matter inflowing from a companion star sojourns for a while to
bifurcate to accretion and excretion flows due to angular momentum transfer in
it. The matter in the accretion ring rotates along the Keplerian circular orbit
determined by the intrinsic specific angular momentum of the inflowing matter
and forms a thick ring-envelope. Two internal flows are expected to appear in
the thick envelope. One is a mass spreading flow bifurcating to a thick
accretion flow and a thick excretion flow, as a result of the angular momentum
transfer within the ring-envelope. The other is a cooling flow toward the
envelope center governed by radiative cooling under an effect of X-ray
irradiation. This cooling flow eventually forms a core in the torus, from which
a thin accretion disk and a thin excretion disk spread out as a result of the
angular momentum transfer there again. Evaluating and comparing the time scales
for the two internal flows, the accretion ring is shown to generally originate
a two-layer accretion flow in which a thin accretion disk is sandwiched by a
thick accretion flow, unless the accretion rate is very low. Properties of the
thin excretion disk and the thick excretion flow are also investigated. The
thin excretion disk is expected to terminate at a distance 4 times as large as
the accretion ring radius and to form another ring there, unless tidal effects
from the companion star exist. The thick excretion flow is, on the other hand,
likely to turn to a super-sonic wind-flow reaching the infinity.

quantify particle microstructure using excess entropy. Results reveal a direct
relation between excess entropy and energy dissipation, that is insensitive to

significant abundance of small grains, of which the origin is still to be
clarified. We examine a possible path of small-grain production through
shattering of pre-existing large grains in the CGM. Possible sites where
shattering occurs on a reasonable time-scale are cool clumps with hydrogen
number density $n_\mathrm{H}\sim 0.1$ cm$^{-3}$ and gas temperature
$T_\mathrm{gas}\sim 10^4$ K, which are shown to exist through observations of
Mg II absorbers. We calculate the evolution of grain size distribution in
physical conditions appropriate for cool clumps in the CGM, starting from a
large-grain-dominated distribution suggested from theoretical studies. With an
appropriate gas turbulence model expected from the physical condition of cold
clumps (maximum eddy size and velocity of $\sim$100 pc and 10 km s$^{-1}$,
respectively), together with the above gas density and temperature and the
dust-to-gas mass ratio inferred from observations (0.006), we find that
small-grain production occurs on a time-scale (a few $\times 10^8$ yr)
comparable to the lifetime of cool clumps derived in the literature. Thus, the
physical conditions of the cool clouds are favrourable for small-grain
production. We also confirm that the reddening becomes significant on the above
time-scale. Therefore, we conclude that small-grain production by shattering is
a probable cause for the observed reddening in the CGM. We also mention the
effect of grain materials (or their mixtures) on the reddening at different
redshifts (1 and 2).

development life-cycles. IoT-related vulnerabilities, if successfully exploited
can affect, not only the device itself, but also the application field in which
the IoT device operates. Evidently, identifying and addressing every single
vulnerability is an arduous, if not impossible, task. Attack taxonomies can
assist in classifying attacks and their corresponding vulnerabilities. Security
countermeasures and best practices can then be leveraged to mitigate threats
and vulnerabilities before they emerge into catastrophic attacks and ensure
overall secure IoT operation. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an attack
taxonomy which takes into consideration the different layers of IoT stack,
i.e., device, infrastructure, communication, and service, and each layer's
designated characteristics which can be exploited by adversaries. Furthermore,
using nine real-world cybersecurity incidents, that had targeted IoT devices
deployed in the consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors, we describe the
IoT-related vulnerabilities, exploitation procedures, attacks, impacts, and
potential mitigation mechanisms and protection strategies. These (and many
other) incidents highlight the underlying security concerns of IoT systems and
demonstrate the potential attack impacts of such connected ecosystems, while
the proposed taxonomy provides a systematic procedure to categorize attacks

composition of linearizable concurrent objects. A prominent example is shared
registers, which have crash-tolerant implementations on top of message-passing
systems, allowing the advantages of shared memory to carry over to
message-passing. Yet linearizable registers do not always behave properly when
used inside randomized programs. A strengthening of linearizability, called
strong linearizability, has been shown to preserve probabilistic behavior, as
well as other hypersafety properties. In order to exploit composition and
abstraction in message-passing systems, it is crucial to know whether there
exist strongly-linearizable implementations of registers in message-passing.
This paper answers the question in the negative: there are no
strongly-linearizable fault-tolerant message-passing implementations of
multi-writer registers, max-registers, snapshots or counters. This result is
proved by reduction from the corresponding result by Helmi et al. The reduction
is a novel extension of the BG simulation that connects shared-memory and
message-passing, supports long-lived objects, and preserves strong
linearizability. The main technical challenge arises from the discrepancy
between the potentially minuscule fraction of failures to be tolerated in the
simulated message-passing algorithm and the large fraction of failures that can
afflict the simulating shared-memory system. The reduction is general and can
be viewed as the inverse of the ABD simulation of shared memory in
message-passing.

computations to be offloaded to the edge of the network. There is great
interest in both the HPC and high-performance data analytics communities in
understanding the roles these devices may play in the data paths of upcoming
systems.
  This paper focuses on characterizing both the networking and computing
aspects of NVIDIA's new BlueField-2 SmartNIC when used in an Ethernet
environment. For the networking evaluation we conducted multiple transfer
experiments between processors located at the host, the SmartNIC, and a remote
host. These tests illuminate how much processing headroom is available on the
SmartNIC during transfers. For the computing evaluation we used the stress-ng
benchmark to compare the BlueField-2 to other servers and place realistic
bounds on the types of offload operations that are appropriate for the
hardware.
  Our findings from this work indicate that while the BlueField-2 provides a
flexible means of processing data at the network's edge, great care must be
taken to not overwhelm the hardware. While the host can easily saturate the
network link, the SmartNIC's embedded processors may not have enough computing
resources to sustain more than half the expected bandwidth when using
kernel-space packet processing. From a computational perspective, encryption
operations, memory operations under contention, and on-card IPC operations on
the SmartNIC perform significantly better than the general-purpose servers used
for comparisons in our experiments. Therefore, applications that mainly focus
on these operations may be good candidates for offloading to the SmartNIC.

detection, better performance depends on a large number of training images with
accurate AU annotations. However, labeling AU is time-consuming, expensive, and
error-prone. Considering AU detection and facial expression recognition (FER)
are two highly correlated tasks, and facial expression (FE) is relatively easy
to annotate, we consider learning AU detection and FER in a multi-task manner.
However, the performance of the AU detection task cannot be always enhanced due
to the negative transfer in the multi-task scenario. To alleviate this issue,
we propose a Meta Auxiliary Learning method (MAL) that automatically selects
highly related FE samples by learning adaptative weights for the training FE
samples in a meta learning manner. The learned sample weights alleviate the
negative transfer from two aspects: 1) balance the loss of each task
automatically, and 2) suppress the weights of FE samples that have large
uncertainties. Experimental results on several popular AU datasets demonstrate
MAL consistently improves the AU detection performance compared with the
state-of-the-art multi-task and auxiliary learning methods. MAL automatically
estimates adaptive weights for the auxiliary FE samples according to their
semantic relevance with the primary AU detection task.

multi-color disk model, relating to the inner disk radius, was similar to each
other. The unabsorbed X-ray fluxes from the disk component in the 0.01-10 keV

However, searching the space of directed graphs and enforcing acyclicity by

generated ordering would then be processed using variable selection to obtain
the final causal graph. We analyze the consistency and computational complexity

exploited to accelerate training. Experimental results on both synthetic and

accretion disk around black holes, are useful probes for the understanding of
gravitational interaction in the near-horizon regime of black holes. Since the
presence of an extra spatial dimension modifies the near horizon geometry of
black holes, it is expected that the study of these quasi-periodic oscillations
may shed some light on the possible existence of these extra dimensions.
Intriguingly, most of the extra dimensional models, which are of significant
interest to the scientific community, predicts the existence of a tidal charge
parameter in black hole spacetimes. This tidal charge parameter can have an
overall negative sign and is a distinctive signature of the extra dimensions.
Motivated by this, we have studied the quasi-periodic oscillations for a
rotating braneworld black hole using the available theoretical models.
Subsequently, we have used the observations of the quasi-periodic oscillations
from available black hole sources, e.g., GRO J1655 -- 40, XTE J1550 -- 564, GRS
1915 + 105, H 1743 + 322 and Sgr A* and have compared them with the predictions
from the relevant theoretical models, in order to estimate the tidal charge

of them predict a negative value for the tidal charge parameter, while for the
others negative values of the tidal charge parameter are also well within the

for stationary ergodic deviations of randomness (a test is consistent if it
detects any deviations from a given class when the sample size goes to $ \infty

has a long and somewhat convoluted history. Though this idea is commonly

views. What is certainly true is that dimensional analysis shows that the speed
of light and Newton's constant of gravitation can be combined to define a
quantity P_* = c^5/G_N with the dimensions of luminosity (equivalently, power).
Then in any physical situation we must have P_{physical} =$\wp$ P_*, where the
quantity $\wp$ is some dimensionless function of dimensionless parameters. This
has lead some authors to suggest a maximum luminosity/maximum power conjecture.
Working within the framework of standard general relativity, we will re-assess
this conjecture, paying particular attention to the extent to which various
examples and counter-examples are physically reasonable. We focus specifically
on Vaidya spacetimes, and on an evaporating version of Schwarzschild's constant
density star. For both of these spacetimes luminosity can be arbitrarily large.

eigenspectra of both wakes exhibit a low-rank behavior and the relative
contribution of low-rank modes to total fluctuation energy increases with
$x/D$. The vortex shedding (VS) mechanism, which corresponds to $St \approx
0.11-0.13$ in both wakes, is active and dominant throughout the domain in both
wakes. The continual downstream decay of the SPOD eigenspectrum peak at the VS
mode, which is a prominent feature of the unstratified wake, is inhibited by
buoyancy, particularly for $Fr = 2$. The energy at and near the VS frequency is
found to appear in the outer region of the wake when the downstream distance
exceeds $Nt = Nx/U = 6 - 8$. Visualizations show that unsteady internal gravity
waves (IGWs) emerge at the same $Nt = 6 - 8$. A causal link between the VS
mechanism and the unsteady IGW generation is also established using the
SPOD-based reconstruction and analysis of the pressure-transport term. These
IGWs are also picked up in SPOD analysis as a structural change in the shape of
the leading SPOD eigenmode. The $Fr = 2$ wake shows layering in the wake core
at {$Nt > 15$} which is captured by the leading SPOD eigenmodes of the VS
frequency at downstream locations $x/D > 30$. The VS mode of the $Fr = 2$ wake
is streamwise-coherent, consisting of V-shaped structures at $x/D \gtrsim 30$.
Overall, we find that the coherence of wakes, initiated by the VS mode at the
body, is prolonged by buoyancy to far downstream. Also, this coherence is
spatially modified by buoyancy into horizontal layers and IGWs. Low-order
truncations of SPOD modes are shown to efficiently reconstruct important
second-order statistics.

dysfunctional or congested base stations. Prior studies on underwater emergency
communications, however, remain under-studied, which poses a need for combining
the merits of different underwater communication links (UCLs) and the
manipulability of unmanned vehicles. To realize energy-efficient underwater
emergency communications, we develop a novel underwater emergency communication
network (UECN) assisted by multiple links, including underwater light,
acoustic, and radio frequency links, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)
for collecting and transmitting underwater emergency data. First, we determine
the optimal emergency response mode for an underwater sensor node (USN) using
greedy search and reinforcement learning (RL), so that isolated USNs (I-USNs)
can be identified. Second, according to the distribution of I-USNs, we dispatch
AUVs to assist I-USNs in data transmission, i.e., jointly optimizing the
locations and controls of AUVs to minimize the time for data collection and
underwater movement. Finally, an adaptive clustering-based multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the number of AUVs and
the transmit power of I-USNs, subject to a given set of constraints on transmit
power, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs), outage probabilities,
and energy, which achieves the best tradeoff between the maximum emergency
response time (ERT) and the total energy consumption (EC). Simulation results
indicate that our proposed approach outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of
energy efficiency (EE), contributing to underwater emergency communications.

search and rescue. Device-to-device (D2D) and device-to-vehicle (D2V) networks
have drawn attention. However, due to the limited D2D coverage and onboard
energy, establishing a hybrid D2D and D2V network is promising. In this
article, we jointly establish, optimize, and fuse D2D and D2V networks to
support energy-efficient emergency communications. First, we establish a D2D
network by optimally dividing ground devices (GDs) into multiple clusters and
identifying temporary data caching centers (TDCCs) from GDs in clusters.
Accordingly, emergency data returned from GDs is cached in TDCCs. Second, given
the distribution of TDCCs, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to
fetch data from TDCCs. Therefore, we establish a UAV-assisted D2V network
through path planning and network configuration optimization. Specifically,
optimal path planning is implemented using cascaded waypoint and motion
planning and optimal network configurations are determined by multiobjective
optimization. Consequently, the best tradeoff between emergency response time

hyper-light axion-type cosmic string. We show that the coupling $\phi F
\tilde{F}$ between the axion $\phi$ and the photon can give rise to a unique
polarimetric structure of the photon ring. The structure emerges due to an
Aharonov-Bohm type effect that leads to a change of the polarization directions

Measuring these patterns can provide us with a way of determining the value of
the coefficient of the mixed anomaly between electromagnetism and the symmetry

(meta-RL) algorithms, which enable autonomous agents to adapt new tasks from
small amount of experience. In meta-RL, the specification (such as reward
function) of current task is hidden from the agent. In addition, states are
hidden within each task owing to sensor noise or limitations in realistic
environments. Therefore, the meta-RL agent faces the challenge of specifying
both the hidden task and states based on small amount of experience. To address
this, we propose estimating disentangled belief about task and states,
leveraging an inductive bias that the task and states can be regarded as global
and local features of each task. Specifically, we train a hierarchical
state-space model (HSSM) parameterized by deep neural networks as an
environment model, whose global and local latent variables correspond to task
and states, respectively. Because the HSSM does not allow analytical
computation of posterior distribution, i.e., belief, we employ amortized
inference to approximate it. After the belief is obtained, we can augment
observations of a model-free policy with the belief to efficiently train the
policy. Moreover, because task and state information are factorized and
interpretable, the downstream policy training is facilitated compared with the
prior methods that did not consider the hierarchical nature. Empirical
validations on a GridWorld environment confirm that the HSSM can separate the
hidden task and states information. Then, we compare the meta-RL agent with the
HSSM to prior meta-RL methods in MuJoCo environments, and confirm that our
agent requires less training data and reaches higher final performance.

fitting the ellipsometric angles with the Lowndes-Gervais model, which applies
two different broadening parameters to the TO and LO phonons. In GaP, the
two-phonon density of states is larger for the decay of TO phonons than for LO
phonons. Therefore, we observed a larger TO phonon broadening (compared to the
LO phonon) and an asymmetric reststrahlen line shape. This would lead to a
negative imaginary part of the dielectric function just above the LO phonon
energy, but the addition of two-phonon absorption avoids this. We find a
temperature dependent redshift and broadening of TO and LO phonons with
increasing temperature due to thermal expansion and anharmonic phonon-phonon
scattering, involving three and four phonon decay processes. We also
investigate the temperature-dependence of the high-frequency dielectric
constant. Its variation is explained by thermal expansion and the temperature

of the operational cost for a wind farm is due to maintenance of the wind

  We combine mathematical modelling of preventive maintenance scheduling with
corrective maintenance strategies. We further consider different types of
contracts between the wind farm owner and a maintenance or insurance company,
and during different phases of the turbines' lives and the contract periods.
Our combined preventive and corrective maintenance models are then applied to
relevant combinations of the phases of the turbines' lives and the contract
types.
  Our case studies show that even with the same initial criteria, the optimal
maintenance schedules differ between different phases of time as well as
between contract types. One case study reveals a 40% cost reduction and a
significantly higher production availability -- 1.8% points -- achieved by our
optimization model as compared to a pure corrective maintenance strategy.
Another study shows that the number of planned preventive maintenance occasions

approximation called frozen-in convection in pulsating stars where $\vec{F}_C$
is the convective energy flux and the prime $^\prime$ indicates Eulerian
perturbation. We find that the general properties of the OsC modes are roughly
the same as those obtained by Lee \& Saio (2020) who assumed $\delta
(\nabla\cdot\vec{F}_C)=0$, except that no OsC modes behave like inertial modes
when they tend toward complete stabilization with increasing rotation frequency
where $\delta$ indicates the Lagrangian perturbation. As the rotation frequency
of the stars increases, the OsC modes are stabilized to resonantly excite
$g$-modes in the envelope when the core rotates slightly faster than the
envelope. The frequency of the OsC modes that excite envelope $g$-modes is
approximately given by $\sigma\sim |m\Omega_c|$ in the inertial frame and hence
$\sigma_{m=-2}\approx2\sigma_{m=-1}$ where $m$ is the azimuthal wavenumber of
the modes and $\Omega_c$ is the rotation frequency of the core. We find that
the modal properties of OsC modes do not strongly depend on the mass of the
stars.
  We discuss angular momentum transport by OsC modes in resonance with envelope

processes induced by the strong interaction, but they will be relevant at
future $e^- e^+$ colliders at high energy. The main difference between QCD and
electroweak processes is that the initial- and final-state particles should
appear in the form of hadrons, that is, color singlets in QCD, while there can
be weak nonsinglets as well in electroweak interactions. We analyze the
factorization theorems for the $N$-jettiness in $e^- e^+ \rightarrow \mu^-

accuracy. To simplify the comparison with QCD, we only consider the $SU(2)_W$
gauge interaction, and the extension to the Standard Model is straightforward.
Put it in a different way, it corresponds to an imaginary world in which
colored particles can be observed in QCD, and the richer structure of effective
theories is probed. Various nonzero nonsinglet matrix elements are interwoven
to produce the factorized results, in contrast to QCD in which there are only
contributions from the singlets. Another distinct feature is that the rapidity
divergence is prevalent in the contributions from weak nonsinglets due to the
different group theory factors between the real and virtual corrections. We
verify that the rapidity divergence cancels in all the contributions with a
different number of nonsinglet channels. We also consider the renormalization
group evolution of each factorized part to resum large logarithms, which are
distinct from QCD.

We then focus on symplectic Monge-Amp\`ere equations in 3 independent

space. If we pass to the field of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, this projective
space turns out to be the projectivization of the 14-dimensional irreducible

associated moment map allows to define a rational map $\varpi$ from the space
of symplectic 3D Monge-Amp\`ere equations to the projectivization of the space
of quadratic forms on a $6$-dimensional symplectic vector space. We study in
details the relationship between the zero locus of the image of $\varpi$,
herewith called the cocharacteristic variety, and the contact cone structure of
a 3D Monge-Amp\`ere equation $\mathcal{E}$: under the hypothesis of
non-degenerate symbol, we prove that these two constructions coincide. A key

an interest on its own.

physical systems across a multidimensional grid over multiple timesteps. The
state-of-the-art techniques in this area fall into three groups: cache-aware
tiled looping algorithms, cache-oblivious divide-and-conquer trapezoidal
algorithms, and Krylov subspace methods.
  In this paper, we present two efficient parallel algorithms for performing
linear stencil computations. Current direct solvers in this domain are
computationally inefficient, and Krylov methods require manual labor and
mathematical training. We solve these problems for linear stencils by using DFT
preconditioning on a Krylov method to achieve a direct solver which is both
fast and general. Indeed, while all currently available algorithms for solving
general linear stencils perform $\Theta(NT)$ work, where $N$ is the size of the
spatial grid and $T$ is the number of timesteps, our algorithms perform $o(NT)$
work.
  To the best of our knowledge, we give the first algorithms that use fast
Fourier transforms to compute final grid data by evolving the initial data for
many timesteps at once. Our algorithms handle both periodic and aperiodic
boundary conditions, and achieve polynomially better performance bounds (i.e.,
computational complexity and parallel runtime) than all other existing
solutions.
  Initial experimental results show that implementations of our algorithms that
evolve grids of roughly $10^7$ cells for around $10^5$ timesteps run orders of
magnitude faster than state-of-the-art implementations for periodic stencil
problems, and 1.3$\times$ to 8.5$\times$ faster for aperiodic stencil problems.

two-phase non-isothermal fluid flow between two infinite horizontal parallel
plates under the influence of a constant pressure gradient and transverse
non-invasive magnetic field have been explored. Both the fluids are considered
to be viscous, incompressible, immiscible, Newtonian, and electrically
conducting. The governing equations in Cartesian coordinate are solved
analytically with the help of appropriate boundary conditions to obtain the
velocity and temperature profile inside the channel. Application of transverse
magnetic field is found to reduce the throughput and the temperature
distribution of the fluids in a pressure-driven flow. The temperature and fluid
flow inside the channel can also be non-invasively altered by tuning the
magnetic field intensity, the temperature difference between the channel walls
and the fluids, and several intrinsic fluid properties. The entropy generation
due to the heat transfer, magnetic field, and fluid flow irreversibilities can
be controlled by altering the Hartmann number, radiation parameter, Brinkmann
number, filling ratio, and the ratios of fluid viscosities, thermal and
electrical conductivities. The surfaces of the channel wall are found to act as
a strong source of entropy generation and heat transfer irreversibility. The
rate of heat transfer at the channel walls can also be tweaked by the magnetic
field intensity, temperature differences, and fluid properties. The proposed

magnetic flux rope (MFR) confined by a helmet streamer, where a
prominence-cavity system forms. This system includes a hot cavity surrounding a
prominence with prominence horns and a central hot core above the prominence.
The evolution of the system from quasi-equilibrium to eruption can be divided
into four phases: quasi-static, slow rise, fast rise, and propagation phases.
The emerged MFR initially stays quasi-static and magnetic reconnection occurs
at the overlying high-Q (squashing factor) apex region, which gradually evolves
into a hyperbolic flux tube (HFT). The decrease of the integrated magnetic
tension force (above the location of the overlying reconnection) is due to the
removal of overlying confinement by the enhanced overlying reconnection between
the MFR and the overlying fields at the apex HFT, thus engines the slow rise of
the MFR with a nearly constant velocity. Once the MFR reaches the regime of
torus instability, another HFT immediately forms at the dip region under the
MFR, followed by the explosive flare reconnection. The integrated resultant
force (above the location of the flare reconnection) exponentially increases,
which drives the exponential fast rise of the MFR. The system enters the
propagation phase, once its apex reaches the height of about one solar radius
above the photosphere. The simulation reproduces the main processes of one
group of prominence eruptions especially those occurring on the quiet Sun.

that presents low computational complexity and memory requirements. It
generalizes arbitrary sampling rate conversion by accommodating time-varying
conversion ratios, i.e., it can efficiently adapt to instantaneous changes of
the input and output sampling rates. This approach is based on appropriately
factorizing the time-varying discrete-time filter used for the conversion.
Common filters that satisfy this factorization property are those where the
underlying continuous-time filter consists of linear combinations of
exponentials, e.g., those described by linear constant-coefficient differential
equations. This factorization separates the computation into two parts: one
consisting of a factor solely depending on the output sampling instants and the
other consists of a summation -- that can be computed recursively -- whose
terms depend solely on the input sampling instants and its number of terms is
given by a relationship between input and output sampling instants. Thus,
nonuniform sampling rates can be accommodated by updating the factors involved
and adjusting the number of terms added. When the impulse response consists of
exponentials, computing the factors can be done recursively in an efficient
manner.

  Objectives - The objective was to assess the relevance of identifying
priority areas for connectivity for groups of species based on common dispersal
abilities. We aimed to assess the impact of target groups choices on predicted
priority areas.
  Method - The study was located at the Thau Lagoon territory to demonstrate

We classified connectivity from high to low levels and averaged the results by

$n$ follows a power law. In the case of the subnucleation regime, when the
nuclei are smaller than $n_{c}$, the $n$-dependence of the quantity $g^{+}$ is
strongly determined by the inherent microscopic properties of a system and this

example, a power law). It has been established that the dependence of the
growth rate of a crystalline nucleus on its size goes into the stationary
regime at the sizes $n>3n_{c}$ particles.

  Video Salient Object Detection","Accepted by ICME2021 as oral",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video salient object detection (VSOD) aims to locate and segment the most
attractive object by exploiting both spatial cues and temporal cues hidden in
video sequences. However, spatial and temporal cues are often unreliable in
real-world scenarios, such as low-contrast foreground, fast motion, and
multiple moving objects. To address these problems, we propose a new framework
to adaptively capture available information from spatial and temporal cues,
which contains Confidence-guided Adaptive Gate (CAG) modules and Dual
Differential Enhancement (DDE) modules. For both RGB features and optical flow
features, CAG estimates confidence scores supervised by the IoU between
predictions and the ground truths to re-calibrate the information with a gate
mechanism. DDE captures the differential feature representation to enrich the
spatial and temporal information and generate the fused features. Experimental
results on four widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method against thirteen state-of-the-art methods.

unsupervised graph representation learning. The existing methods are typically
effective to capture information from the topology view but ignore the feature
view. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel approach by exploiting
mutual information maximization across feature and topology views.
Specifically, we first utilize a multi-view representation learning module to
better capture both local and global information content across feature and
topology views on graphs. To model the information shared by the feature and
topology spaces, we then develop a common representation learning module using
mutual information maximization and reconstruction loss minimization. To
explicitly encourage diversity between graph representations from the same
view, we also introduce a disagreement regularization to enlarge the distance
between representations from the same view. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating feature and
topology views. In particular, compared with the previous supervised methods,
our proposed method can achieve comparable or even better performance under the
unsupervised representation and linear evaluation protocol.

into the DW inversion mechanism, showing that DW inversion proceeds by
annihilation of the incoming domain on one side of the in-plane region and
nucleation of a reverse domain on the opposite side. By changing the shape of
the in-plane magnetic region, we show that the DW inversion efficiency can be
tuned by adjusting the ratio between the chiral coupling energy at the inverter

realize an asymmetric DW inverter that has nonreciprocal inversion properties

lower infection rates. Health and economic concerns of agents turn out to have

spatial distribution and temperature behavior of spontaneous polarization for
several types of stable domain structure in thin ferroelectric films, such as
stripe domains and vortices.Finite element modelling (FEM) for BaTiO3 films and
analytical calculations within the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach reveals
that an out-of-plane polarization component can be very sensitive to the
flexoelectric coupling for periodic quasi-2D stripe domains and 3D
vortex-antivortex structures.However, the influence is rather different for
these structures. The flexoelectric coupling increases significantly the
amplitude of a small out-of-plane polarization component in the stripe domains,
and the ""up"" or ""down"" direction of the component is defined by the sign of the
flexoelectric coefficients.Concerning the vortex-antivortex pairs, their
antivortices with in-plane anti-circulation have smooth wide dipolar cores
through the entire film, whose shape and other features are almost insensitive
to the coupling.The vortices with in-plane vorticity have spike-like cores with
an out-of-plane quadrupolar moment induced by the flexoelectric coupling. The
cores are located near the film-dead layer interfaces.FEM results corroborated
by analytical calculations prove that a change of the flexoelectric coefficient
sign leads to a reorientation of the core axial polarization, making the
flexo-sensitive 3D vortices similar to the recently introduced ""flexons"" in
cylindrical nanoparticles.The relatively wide temperature range (from 200 to
400 K) of the flexo-sensitive vortices' existence gives us the hope that they
can be observed experimentally in thin ferroelectric films by scanning probe

problem, with many real-world applications in information retrieval such as
content classification on a social network and query intent classification on
an e-commerce query graph. While traditional approaches are largely
transductive, recent graph neural networks (GNNs) integrate node features with
network structures, thus enabling inductive node classification models that can
be applied to new nodes or even new graphs in the same feature space. However,
inter-graph differences still exist across graphs within the same domain. Thus,
training just one global model (e.g., a state-of-the-art GNN) to handle all new
graphs, whilst ignoring the inter-graph differences, can lead to suboptimal
performance.
  In this paper, we study the problem of inductive node classification across
graphs. Unlike existing one-model-fits-all approaches, we propose a novel
meta-inductive framework called MI-GNN to customize the inductive model to each
graph under a meta-learning paradigm. That is, MI-GNN does not directly learn
an inductive model; it learns the general knowledge of how to train a model for
semi-supervised node classification on new graphs. To cope with the differences
across graphs, MI-GNN employs a dual adaptation mechanism at both the graph and
task levels. More specifically, we learn a graph prior to adapt for the
graph-level differences, and a task prior to adapt for the task-level
differences conditioned on a graph. Extensive experiments on five real-world
graph collections demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

investigate the fixation probability of neutral bacterial mutants within a

gradients of food and bacterial concentrations. We find that this fixation
probability is substantially increased compared to an equivalent well-mixed
system, in the regime where the profiles of food and bacterial concentration
are strongly spatially-dependent. Fixation probability then becomes independent
of total population size. We show that our results can be rationalized by
introducing an active population, which consists of those bacteria that are
actively consuming food and dividing. The active population size yields an
effective population size for neutral mutant fixation probability in the gut.

functions we have investigated the clustering properties of different classes
of objects from the Fermi LAT 4FGL catalogue. We wanted to test the idea based
on optical polarization observations that there might be large volumes of space
in which AGN axes are aligned. To do this we needed a clean sample of blazars
as these are objects with their jet axes pointing towards the observer and
Fermi sources provide such a sample. We find that high latitude Fermi sources
taken as a whole show a significant clustering signal on scales up to 30
degrees. To investigate if all blazars behave in the same way we used the
machine learning classifications of Kovacevic, et al. (2020), which are based
only on gamma-ray information, to separate BL Lac-like objects from FSRQ-like
objects. A possible explanation for the clustering signal we find amongst the
BL Lac-like objects is that there are indeed large volumes of space in which
AGN axes are aligned. This signal might be washed out in FSRQs since they
occupy a much larger volume of space. Thus our results support the idea that
large scale polarization alignments could originate from coherent alignments of
AGN axes. We speculate that these axis alignments may be related to the
well-known intrinsic alignments of galaxy optical position angles.

flows containing a minimal number of active triadic interactions is proposed.
The key idea is to find an appropriate set of basis functions for the
projection representing elementary flow structures that interact minimally one
with the other and thus result in a triadic interaction coefficient tensor with
sparse structure. Interpretable and computationally efficient Galerkin models
can be thus obtained, since a reduced number of triadic interactions needs to
be computed to evaluate the right hand side of the model. To find the basis
functions, a subspace rotation technique is used, whereby a set of Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) modes is rotated into a POD subspace of larger
dimension using coordinates associated to low-energy dissipative scales to
alter energy paths and the structure of the triadic interaction coefficient
tensor. This rotation is obtained as the solution of a non-convex optimisation
problem that maximises the energy captured by the new basis, promotes sparsity
and ensures long-term temporal stability of the sparse Galerkin system. We
demonstrate the approach on two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow at $Re = 2
\times 10^4$ where the motion is chaotic. We show that the procedure generates
Galerkin models with a reduced set of active triadic interactions, distributed
in modal space according to established knowledge of scale interactions in
two-dimensional flows. This property, however, is only observed if long-term
temporal stability is explicitly included in the formulation, indicating that a
dynamical constraint is necessary to obtain a physically consistent
sparsification.

challenging tasks, which traditionally rely on calculating the mean squared
displacement of the trajectory. However, this approach breaks down for cases of
important practical interest, e.g., short or noisy trajectories, ensembles of
heterogeneous trajectories, or non-ergodic processes. Recently, several new

  In the case of one-dimensional actions, Ma\~ne's theorem generalizes to

idea is the introduction of so-called automatic spaces. We also study the

define the $\beta$-kernel -- the least subshift relation that identifies $1$

engineering systems with versatile characteristics that targeted niche

Kresling origami spring (KOS), which inspired, among many other things, the
design of vibration isolators, fluidic muscles, and mechanical bit memory
switches. Previous demonstrations of such concepts were carried out using
paper-based KOSs, which are suitable for conceptual illustrations but not for
implementation in a real environment. In addition to the very low durability
resulting from the high plastic deformations at the paper folds; lack of
repeatability, and high variation of performance among similar samples are also
inevitable. To circumvent these issues, this paper presents a novel approach
for the design of a non-paper based KOS, which mimics the qualitative behavior
of the paper-based KOS without compromising on durability, repeatability, and
functionality. In the new design, each fundamental triangle in the paper-based
KOS is replaced by an inner central rigid core and an outer flexible
rubber-like frame, which are fabricated out of different visco-elastic
materials using advanced 3-D printing technologies. The quasi-static behavior
of the fabricated springs was assessed under both compressive and tensile
loads. It is shown that KOSs with linear, softening, hardening, mono- and
bi-stable restoring force behavior can be fabricated using the proposed design
by simple changes to the geometric design parameters, further pointing to the
vast range of potential applications of such springs.

\approx 1.3$, only the second detection of HI 21 cm emission at $z\ge1$. We
obtain an average HI mass of $\langle {\rm M_{HI}} \rangle=(3.09 \pm 0.61)
\times 10^{10}\ {\rm M}_\odot$ and an HI-to-stellar mass ratio of $2.6\pm0.5$,
both significantly higher than values in galaxies with similar stellar masses
in the local Universe. We also stacked the 1.4 GHz continuum emission of the
galaxies to obtain a median star-formation rate (SFR) of $14.5\pm1.1\ {\rm
M}_\odot \textrm{yr}^{-1}$. This implies an average HI depletion timescale of
$\approx 2$ Gyr for blue star-forming galaxies at $z\approx 1.3$, a factor of
$\approx 3.5$ lower than that of similar local galaxies. Our results suggest
that the HI content of galaxies towards the end of the epoch of peak cosmic SFR
density is insufficient to sustain their high SFR for more than $\approx 2$
Gyr. Insufficient gas accretion to replenish the HI could then explain the
observed decline in the cosmic SFR density at $z< 1$.

attracted considerable attention in the hyperspectral remote sensing domain due
to the powerful reconstruction ability compared with traditional methods.
However, actual probability distribution statistics hidden in the latent space

probability distribution of anomalies is not explicitly modeled. To address the
issue, we propose a novel probability distribution representation detector
(PDRD) that explores the intrinsic distribution of both the background and the
anomalies in original data for hyperspectral anomaly detection in this paper.
First, we represent the hyperspectral data with multivariate Gaussian
distributions from a probabilistic perspective. Then, we combine the local
statistics with the obtained distributions to leverage the spatial information.
Finally, the difference between the corresponding distributions of the test
pixel and the average expectation of the pixels in the Chebyshev neighborhood
is measured by computing the modified Wasserstein distance to acquire the
detection map. We conduct the experiments on four real data sets to evaluate
the performance of our proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate the
accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art

serious threat to public health and the economy. Rapid and accurate diagnosis

its mortality. Chest Computed tomography (CT) is an effective tool for the
early diagnosis of lung diseases including pneumonia. However, detecting
COVID-19 from CT is demanding and prone to human errors as some early-stage
patients may have negative findings on images. Recently, many deep learning
methods have achieved impressive performance in this regard. Despite their
effectiveness, most of these methods underestimate the rich spatial information
preserved in the 3D structure or suffer from the propagation of errors. To
address this problem, we propose a Dual-Attention Residual Network (DARNet) to

mechanisms. The former is utilized to enhance channel independence, while the
latter is developed to recalibrate the depth-level features. Then, we integrate
them in a unified manner to extract and refine the features at different levels
to further improve the diagnostic performance. We evaluate DARNet on a large

difference is varied. This variation in chemical shift is thought to originate
from a combination of ion reorganisation in the pores and changes in ring
current shifts due to the changes of electronic density in the carbon. While
previous Density Functional Theory calculations suggested that the electronic
density has a large effect, the relative contributions of these two effects is
challenging to untangle. Here, we use mesoscopic simulations to simulate NMR
spectra and investigate the relative importance of ion reorganisation and ring
currents on the resulting chemical shift. The model is able to predict chemical
shifts in good agreement with NMR experiments and indicates that the ring
currents are the dominant contribution. A thorough analysis of a specific
electrode/electrolyte combination for which detailed NMR experiments have been
reported allows us to confirm that local ion reorganisation has a very limited
effect but the relative quantities of ions in pores of different sizes, which
can change upon charging/discharging, can lead to a significant effect. Our
findings suggest that in situ NMR spectra of supercapacitors may provide

extra-dimensional model such that the mediator(s) are the Kaluza-Klein (KK)
modes of the 5D graviton. We pay close attention to dark matter annihilations
into KK-gravitons. Due to the high energy behavior of longitudinal modes of
spin-2 fields, these channels exhibit a tremendous growth at large center of
mass energies $\sqrt{s}$ if only one spin-2 mediator is considered. For the
first time, we include the full KK-tower in this dark matter production process
and find that this growth is unphysical and cancels once the full field content
of the extra-dimensional theory is taken into account. Interestingly, this
implies that it is not possible to approximate the results obtained in the full
theory with a reduced set of effective interactions once $\sqrt{s}$ is greater
than the first graviton mass. This casts some doubt on the universal
applicability of previous studies with spin-2 mediators within an EFT framework

Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) to measure the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson
decay to two photons. Since photons are massless, they are not coupled to the
Higgs boson at the tree level, but they are created in a loop exchange of heavy
particles either from the Standard Model or beyond. Any deviation of the
effective $H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ branching ratio and consequently of the
Higgs to photon coupling may indicate New Physics. The Higgs decay to two
photons is thus an interesting probe of the Higgs sector, both at the running
and future experiments. A similar study has been performed by C. Grefe at 1.4
TeV CLIC, where the statistical uncertainty is determined to be 15\% for an
integrated luminosity of 1.5 $ab^{-1}$ with unpolarized beams. \noindent This
study is performed using a full simulation of the detector for CLIC and by
considering all relevant physics and beam-induced processes in a full
reconstruction chain. The measurement is simulated on 5000 samples of
pseudo-experiments and the relative statistical uncertainty is extracted from
the pull distribution. It is shown that the Higgs production cross-section in
$W^+W^-$ fusion times the branching ratio BR($H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$) can be
measured with a relative statistical accuracy of 8.2\%, assuming an integrated
luminosity of 5 $ab^{-1}$ with unpolarized beams.

anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by primordial fluctuations
of the QCD axion \cite{Iso:2020pzv}. In this scenario, fluctuations of
radiations are generated by an energy exchange between axions and radiations,
which results in the correlation between the primordial axion fluctuations and
the CMB anisotropies. Consequently, the cosmological observations stringently
constrain a model of the axion and the early history of the universe. In
particular, we need a large energy fraction $\Omega_A^{}$ of the axion at the
QCD phase transition, but it must become tiny at the present universe to
suppress the isocurvature power spectrum. One of natural cosmological scenarios
to realize such a situation is the thermal inflation which can sufficiently
dilute the axion abundance. Thermal inflation occurs in various models. In this
paper, we focus on a classically conformal (CC) $B$-$L$ model with a QCD axion.
In this model, the early universe undergoes a long supercooling era of the
$B$-$L$ and electroweak symmetries, and thermal inflation naturally occurs.
Thus it can be a good candidate for the axion-CMB scenario. But the axion
abundance at the QCD transition is shown to be insufficient in the original CC
$B$-$L$ model. To overcome the situation, we extend the model by introducing
$N$ scalar fields $S$ (either massive or massless) and consider a novel
cosmological history such that the $O(N)$ and the $B$-$L$ sectors evolve almost
separately in the early universe. We find that all the necessary conditions for
the axion-CMB scenario can be satisfied in some parameter regions for massless
$S$ fields, typically $N\sim 10^{19}$ and the mass of $B$-$L$ gauge boson
around $5-10$ TeV.

processing. Traditional NER research only deals with flat entities and ignores
nested entities. The span-based methods treat entity recognition as a span
classification task. Although these methods have the innate ability to handle
nested NER, they suffer from high computational cost, ignorance of boundary
information, under-utilization of the spans that partially match with entities,
and difficulties in long entity recognition. To tackle these issues, we propose
a two-stage entity identifier. First we generate span proposals by filtering
and boundary regression on the seed spans to locate the entities, and then
label the boundary-adjusted span proposals with the corresponding categories.
Our method effectively utilizes the boundary information of entities and
partially matched spans during training. Through boundary regression, entities
of any length can be covered theoretically, which improves the ability to
recognize long entities. In addition, many low-quality seed spans are filtered
out in the first stage, which reduces the time complexity of inference.
Experiments on nested NER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.

nanopillar arrays such that they temporally reshape pulses upon transmission

mask of the actor which performs the actions described by a natural language
query in the target frames. Existing methods adopt 3D CNNs over the video clip
as a general encoder to extract a mixed spatio-temporal feature for the target
frame. Though 3D convolutions are amenable to recognizing which actor is
performing the queried actions, it also inevitably introduces misaligned
spatial information from adjacent frames, which confuses features of the target
frame and yields inaccurate segmentation. Therefore, we propose a collaborative
spatial-temporal encoder-decoder framework which contains a 3D temporal encoder
over the video clip to recognize the queried actions, and a 2D spatial encoder
over the target frame to accurately segment the queried actors. In the decoder,
a Language-Guided Feature Selection (LGFS) module is proposed to flexibly
integrate spatial and temporal features from the two encoders. We also propose
a Cross-Modal Adaptive Modulation (CMAM) module to dynamically recombine
spatial- and temporal-relevant linguistic features for multimodal feature
interaction in each stage of the two encoders. Our method achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks with less computational

illumination conditions is a complex process. Although there have been several
studies on illumination estimation and relighting, very few of them focus on
estimating the reflectance properties of outdoor objects and scenes. This paper
addresses this problem and proposes a complete framework to predict surface
reflectance properties of outdoor scenes under unknown natural illumination.
Uniquely, we recast the problem into its two constituent components involving
the BRDF incoming light and outgoing view directions: (i) surface points'
radiance captured in the images, and outgoing view directions are aggregated
and encoded into reflectance maps, and (ii) a neural network trained on
reflectance maps of renders of a unit sphere under arbitrary light directions
infers a low-parameter reflection model representing the reflectance properties
at each surface in the scene. Our model is based on a combination of
phenomenological and physics-based scattering models and can relight the scenes
from novel viewpoints. We present experiments that show that rendering with the
predicted reflectance properties results in a visually similar appearance to
using textures that cannot otherwise be disentangled from the reflectance
properties.

performing multi-objective optimisation on the same SNN, focusing on searching
network connectivity parameters to achieve target firing rates of excitatory

sparsity. We showed that NSGA-III could readily optimise for various firing

equal to that of inhibitory neurons, the errors were small. Moreover, when
connectivity sparsity was considered as a parameter to be optimised, the
optimal solutions required sparse network connectivity. We also found that for
excitatory neural firing rates lower than that of inhibitory neurons, the

and devices, including III-nitrides, metal oxides, and two-dimensional (2D)

The van der Waals BN layer, in this case, acts as a preferred mechanical
release layer for precise separation at the substrate-film interface and leaves
a smooth surface suitable for van der Waals bonding. A tensilely-stressed Ni
layer sputtered on top of the film induces controlled spalling fracture which
propagates at the BN/sapphire interface. By incorporating controlled spalling,
the process yield and sensitivity is greatly improved, owed to the greater
fracture energy provided by the stressed metal layer relative to a soft tape or
rubber stamp. With stress playing a critical role in this process, the
influence of residual stress on detrimental cracking and bowing is
investigated. Additionally, a selected area lift-off technique is developed
which allows for isolation and transfer of individual devices while maximizing
wafer area use and minimizing extra alignment steps in the integration process.

and visually plausible screentones are synthesized in pattern-agnostic regions.

outputs, science itself has come under the microscope with the aim of capturing
a quantitative understanding of its workings. In this study, we leverage
well-established cognitive models coming from anthropology in order to
characterise the personal network of collaborations between scientists, i.e.,
the network considered from the standpoint of each individual researcher
(referred to as ego network), in terms of the cognitive investment they devote
to the different collaborations. Building upon these models, we study the
interplay between the structure of academic collaborations, academic
performance, and academic mobility at different career stages. We take into
account both purely academic mobility (i.e., the number of affiliation changes)
and geographical mobility (i.e., physical relocations to different countries).
For our investigation, we rely on a dataset comprising the geo-referenced
publications of a group of 81,500 authors extracted from Scopus, one of the
biggest repositories of academic knowledge. Our main finding is that there is a
clear correlation between the structure of co-authorship ego networks and
academic performance indices: the more one publishes and the higher their
impact, the larger their collaboration network. However, we observe a capacity
bound effect, whereby, beyond a certain point, higher performances become
increasingly less correlated with large collaboration networks. We also find
that international academic migrants are better at growing their networks than
researchers that only migrate within the same country, but the latter seem to
be better in exploiting their collaboration to achieve higher impact. High
academic mobility does not appear to translate into better academic performance
or larger collaboration networks.

While no doubts exist that it is mainly formed on the interstellar dust grain
surfaces, many details of this process remain poorly known. In this work, we
focus on the fate of the energy released by the H$_2$ formation on the dust icy
mantles, how it is partitioned between the substrate and the newly formed
H$_2$, a process that has a profound impact on the interstellar medium. We
carried out state-of-art \textit{ab-initio} molecular dynamics simulations of
H$_2$ formation on periodic crystalline and amorphous ice surface models. Our
calculations show that up to two thirds of the energy liberated in the reaction
($\sim$300 kJ/mol $\sim$3.1 eV) is absorbed by the ice in less than 1 ps. The
remaining energy ($\sim$140 kJ/mol $\sim$1.5 eV) is kept by the newly born
H$_2$. Since it is ten times larger than the H$_2$ binding energy on the ice,
the new H$_2$ molecule will eventually be released into the gas-phase. The ice
water molecules within $\sim$4 \AA ~from the reaction site acquire enough
energy, between 3 and 14 kJ/mol (360--1560 K), to potentially liberate other
frozen H$_2$ and, perhaps, frozen CO molecules. If confirmed, the latter
process would solve the long standing conundrum of the presence of gaseous CO
in molecular clouds. Finally, the vibrational state of the newly formed H$_2$
drops from highly excited states ($\nu = 6$) to low ($\nu \leq 2$) vibrational
levels in a timescale of the order of ps.

model's match/mismatch predictions can be used as a proxy for speech
intelligibility without subject-specific (re)training. Approach: We evaluated
the performance of the model as a function of input segment length, EEG
frequency band and receptive field size while comparing it to multiple baseline
models. Next, we evaluated performance on held-out data and finetuning.
Finally, we established a link between the accuracy of our model and the
state-of-the-art behavioral MATRIX test. Main results: The dilated
convolutional model significantly outperformed the baseline models for every
input segment length, for all EEG frequency bands except the delta and theta
band, and receptive field sizes between 250 and 500 ms. Additionally,
finetuning significantly increased the accuracy on a held-out dataset. Finally,
a significant correlation (r=0.59, p=0.0154) was found between the speech
reception threshold estimated using the behavioral MATRIX test and our
objective method. Significance: Our method is the first to predict the speech
reception threshold from EEG for unseen subjects, contributing to objective
measures of speech intelligibility.

as it allows system designers to measure the freshness of the information
available to remote monitoring or control processes. However, its definition
tacitly assumes that new information is used at any time, which is not always
the case: the instants at which information is collected and used are dependent
on a certain query process. We propose a model that accounts for the discrete
time nature of many monitoring processes, considering a pull-based
communication model in which the freshness of information is only important
when the receiver generates a query: if the monitoring process is not using the
value, the age of the last update is irrelevant. We then define the Age of
Information at Query (QAoI), a more general metric that fits the pull-based
scenario, and show how its optimization can lead to very different choices from
traditional push-based AoI optimization when using a Packet Erasure Channel
(PEC) and with limited link availability. Our results show that QAoI-aware
optimization can significantly reduce the average and worst-case perceived age
for both periodic and stochastic queries.

broken under almost all the arrangements by the formation of a magnetic state

ends, two holes are localized at either end of the chain while the others have
a nearly uniform distribution over the middle; this implies the existence of

and Projected Entangled-Pair States, and some corresponding to classical spin
models. We show how uniform lower bounds to the gap of the parent Hamiltonian
along the adiabatic trajectory can be efficiently computed using semi-definite
programming. This allows one to check whether the adiabatic preparation can be
performed efficiently with a scalable effort. We also derive a set of
observables whose expectation values can be easily determined and that form a
complete set, in the sense that they uniquely characterize the state. We
identify a subset of those observables which can be efficiently computed if one
has access to the quantum state and local measurements, and analyze how they
can be used in verification procedures.

Line Observations ($^{3D}$BAROLO) and DiskFit softwares. Circular motions
dominate the kinematics of the gas in the central discs, mainly in NGC 4845 and
MCG-06-30-15, however there is a clear evidence of non-circular motions in the
central ($\sim$ 1 kpc) region of NGC 4845 and NGC 4968. The strongest
non-circular motion is detected in the inner disc of NGC 4968 with velocity
$\sim 115\, \rm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The bisymmetric model is found to give the
best-fit for NGC 4968 and NGC 4845. If the dynamics of NGC 4968 is modeled as a
corotation pattern just outside of the bar, the bar pattern speed turns out to
be at $\Omega_b$ = $52\, \rm{km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}}$ the corotation is set at
3.5 kpc and the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) ring at R = 300pc corresponding
to the CO emission ring. The 1.2 mm ALMA continuum is peaked and compact in NGC
4968 and MCG-06-30-15, but their CO(2-1) has an extended distribution. Allowing
the CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor $\alpha_{CO}$ between 0.8 and 3.2, typical
of nearby galaxies of the same type, the molecular mass M(H$_{2}$) is estimated
to be $\sim 3-12\times 10^{7} ~{\rm M_\odot}$ (NGC 4968), $\sim 9-36\times
10^{7}~ {\rm M_\odot}$ (NGC 4845), and $\sim 1-4\times 10^{7}~ {\rm M_\odot}$
(MCG-06-30-15). We conclude that the observed non-circular motions in the disc
of NGC 4968 and likely that seen in NGC 4845 is due to the presence of the bar
in the nuclear region. At the current spectral and spatial resolution and
sensitivity we cannot claim any strong evidence in these sources of the long
sought feedback/feeding effect due to the AGN presence.

sequential steps: \textit{i}) estimating the blur kernel from given
low-resolution (LR) image and \textit{ii}) restoring the SR image based on the
estimated kernel. This two-step solution involves two independently trained
models, which may not be well compatible with each other. A small estimation
error of the first step could cause a severe performance drop of the second
one. While on the other hand, the first step can only utilize limited
information from the LR image, which makes it difficult to predict a highly
accurate blur kernel. Towards these issues, instead of considering these two
steps separately, we adopt an alternating optimization algorithm, which can
estimate the blur kernel and restore the SR image in a single model.
Specifically, we design two convolutional neural modules, namely
\textit{Restorer} and \textit{Estimator}. \textit{Restorer} restores the SR
image based on the predicted kernel, and \textit{Estimator} estimates the blur
kernel with the help of the restored SR image. We alternate these two modules
repeatedly and unfold this process to form an end-to-end trainable network. In
this way, \textit{Estimator} utilizes information from both LR and SR images,
which makes the estimation of the blur kernel easier. More importantly,
\textit{Restorer} is trained with the kernel estimated by \textit{Estimator},
instead of the ground-truth kernel, thus \textit{Restorer} could be more
tolerant to the estimation error of \textit{Estimator}. Extensive experiments
on synthetic datasets and real-world images show that our model can largely
outperform state-of-the-art methods and produce more visually favorable results
at a much higher speed. The source code is available at

holes on event horizon scales, providing tests of the theory of general
relativity and increasing our understanding of black hole accretion processes.
The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) performs these observations from the ground,
and its main imaging targets are Sagittarius A* in the Galactic Center and the
black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy. However, the EHT is fundamentally
limited in its performance by atmospheric effects and sparse terrestrial
$(u,v)$-coverage (Fourier sampling of the image). The scientific interest in
quantitative studies of the horizon size and shape of these black holes has
motivated studies into using space interferometry which is free of these
limitations. Angular resolution considerations and interstellar scattering
effects push the desired observing frequency to bands above 500 GHz.
  This paper presents the requirements for meeting these science goals,
describes the concept of interferometry from Polar or Equatorial Medium Earth
Orbits (PECMEO) which we dub the Event Horizon Imager (EHI), and utilizes
suitable space technology heritage. In this concept, two or three satellites
orbit at slightly different orbital radii, resulting in a dense and uniform
spiral-shaped $(u,v)$-coverage over time. The local oscillator signals are
shared via an inter-satellite link, and the data streams are correlated
on-board before final processing on the ground. Inter-satellite metrology and
satellite positioning are extensively employed to facilitate the knowledge of
the instrument position vector, and its time derivative. The European space
heritage usable for both the front ends and the antenna technology of such an
instrument is investigated. Current and future sensors for the required
inter-satellite metrology are listed. Intended performance estimates and
simulation results are given.

networks. With the ever-increasing data traffic, demand for more data capacity
indoors is also growing. The lower frequencies of the legacy frequency bands of
macro outdoor cells manage to provide coverage inside buildings, however, new
frequencies foreseen for the 5th generation (5G) of mobile communications in
the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum penetrate very poorly into buildings.
Therefore, a massive densification of the network would require to deploy a
large number of indoor small cells, which would lead to high deployment costs
to install the necessary wired/optical backhaul. Hence, other methods are
needed that allow an increase of the data capacity indoors, bearing a lower
cost than a fiber deployment. We propose a cost-efficient out-of-band repeater
architecture that provides more data capacity indoors than an outdoor
macro/micro network can provide to indoor, without adversely affecting a legacy
network, and which readily works with the established cellular infrastructure
as well as standard handsets/smartphones. This proposal is compared to
conventional in- and out-of-band repeaters and relay nodes in order to
highlight the advantages of our solution. While the data capacity for a single
link is similar to that of repeaters and relays, a macro cell can be
effectively offloaded. Cell capacities corresponding to at least 3--4 times
that of a repeater or relay solution can be provided, depending on the number
of parallel installed links and the bandwidth in the mmWave spectrum.

High-quality synthetic X-ray images can facilitate various applications such as

difficult to produce high-quality arbitrary view synthetic X-ray images in
real-time due to different CT slice thickness, high computational cost, and the
complexity of algorithms. Our goal is to generate high-resolution synthetic
X-ray images in real-time by upsampling low-resolution images with deep
learning-based super-resolution methods. Reference-based Super Resolution
(RefSR) has been well studied in recent years and has shown higher performance
than traditional Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). It can produce fine
details by utilizing the reference image but still inevitably generates some
artifacts and noise. In this paper, we introduce frequency domain loss as a
constraint to further improve the quality of the RefSR results with fine
details and without obvious artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first paper utilizing the frequency domain for the loss functions in the
field of super-resolution. We achieved good results in evaluating our method on
both synthetic and real X-ray image datasets.

mechanics, it is common to infer the earthquake breakdown energy from
seismological measurements. Breakdown energy is observed to scale with slip,
which is often attributed to enhanced fault weakening with continued slip or at
high slip rates, possibly caused by flash heating and thermal pressurization.
However, breakdown energy varies by more than six orders of magnitude, which is
physically irreconcilable with prevailing material properties. We present a
dynamic model that demonstrates that breakdown energy scaling can occur despite
constant fracture energy and does not require thermal pressurization or other
enhanced weakening. Instead, earthquake breakdown energy scaling occurs simply
due to scale-invariant stress drop overshoot, which is affected more directly
by the overall rupture mode -- crack-like or pulse-like -- rather than from a
specific slip-weakening relationship. Our findings suggest that breakdown
energy may be used to discern crack-like earthquakes from self-healing pulses
with negative breakdown energy.

ionizing photon production rates increase with increasing initial mass. For the
rotational velocities considered we see changes of up to 25% to ionizing
photons produced. This varies with initial mass and ionizing photon species and
reflects changes to surface properties due to rotation. We have also found that
higher convective overshooting increases ionizing photon production by
approximately 20% for the change in overshooting considered here. For stellar
populations, we explore how the production of ionizing photons varies as a
function of the initial mass function (IMF) slope, and minimum and maximum
initial masses. For a fixed population mass we have found changes of the order

for spatio-temporal point-referenced data that is flexible enough to
accommodate data from most ecological surveys while being structured enough to
facilitate analyses without advanced coding. Our implementation in the staRVe
package uses a computationally efficient version of a nearest neighbour
Gaussian process enabling analysis of relatively large datasets. 3.) A brief
simulation study shows our model produces accurate predictions and forecasts,
while a tutorial analysis of a Carolina wren survey suggests a recommended
workflow for analyses. We also analyze a more complicated scientific survey of
haddock to showcase the capabilities of our model. 4.) Our model and package
are tools that can easily be added to researchers' workflow to help make sense
of data from ecological surveys. We emphasize the ability of our model to
create useful visualisations of data which can then lead to identification of
important trends in species distributions.

as for privacy protection. Deep generative models, such as variational
autoencoders (VAEs), are a popular approach for creating such synthetic
datasets from original data. Despite the success of VAEs, there are limitations
when it comes to the bimodal and skewed marginal distributions. These deviate
from the unimodal symmetric distributions that are encouraged by the normality
assumption typically used for the latent representations in VAEs. While there
are extensions that assume other distributions for the latent space, this does
not generally increase flexibility for data with many different distributions.
Therefore, we propose a novel method, pre-transformation variational
autoencoders (PTVAEs), to specifically address bimodal and skewed data, by
employing pre-transformations at the level of original variables. Two types of
transformations are used to bring the data close to a normal distribution by a
separate parameter optimization for each variable in a dataset. We compare the
performance of our method with other state-of-the-art methods for synthetic
data generation. In addition to the visual comparison, we use a utility
measurement for a quantitative evaluation. The results show that the PTVAE
approach can outperform others in both bimodal and skewed data generation.
Furthermore, the simplicity of the approach makes it usable in combination with
other extensions of VAE.

combine non-determinism and probability. At a technical level, the problem
arises from the fact that there is a no distributive law between the powerset
monad and the distribution monad - as noticed some twenty years ago by Plotkin.
More recently, it has become clear that there is a distributive law of the
multiset monad over the distribution monad. This article elaborates the details
of this distributivity and shows that there is a rich underlying theory
relating multisets and probability distributions. It is shown that the new
distributive law, called parallel multinomial law, can be defined in (at least)
four equivalent ways. It involves putting multinomial distributions in parallel
and commutes with hypergeometric distributions. Further, it is shown that this
distributive law commutes with a new form of zipping for multisets. Abstractly,
this can be described in terms of monoidal structure for a fixed-size multiset
functor, when lifted to the Kleisli category of the distribution monad.
Concretely, an application of the theory to sampling semantics is included.

open-string instabilities. The one-loop potential, which depends on the
positions of the D-branes, is minimized for maximally broken, nonlinearly
realized supersymmetry. The orientifold projection and the effective field
theory description reveal a soft breaking of supersymmetry in the closed-string
sector. In such models it is possible to decouple the gravitino mass from the
value of the scalar potential, while avoiding brane instabilities.

  Retrieval for Quantitative Phase Imaging",,,,,"eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A novel formulation of the hyperspectral broadband phase retrieval is
developed for the scenario where both object and modulation phase masks are
spectrally varying. The proposed algorithm is based on a complex domain version
of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and Spectral
Proximity Operators (SPO) derived for Gaussian and Poissonian observations.
Computations for these operators are reduced to the solution of sets of cubic
(for Gaussian) and quadratic (for Poissonian) algebraic equations. These
proximity operators resolve two problems. Firstly, the complex domain spectral
components of signals are extracted from the total intensity observations
calculated as sums of the signal spectral intensities. In this way, the
spectral analysis of the total intensities is achieved. Secondly, the noisy
observations are filtered, compromising noisy intensity observations and their
predicted counterparts. The ability to resolve the hyperspectral broadband
phase retrieval problem and to find the spectrum varying object are essentially
defined by the spectral properties of object and image formation operators. The
simulation tests demonstrate that the phase retrieval in this formulation can
be successfully resolved.

deformations by exploiting elastic strain and do not need, therefore, moving
parts. The number of degrees of freedom of a conventional mechanism, also
called mobility, is the number of independent coordinates needed to define a
configuration of the mechanism. Due to the different operating principle, such
definition of degree of freedom or mobility cannot be directly applied to
compliant mechanisms. While those terms are not able to denote a property of a
given compliant mechanism, they are meaningful when applied to the design of a
compliant mechanism. Compliant mechanisms are, however, mostly seen as elastic
structures, for which the term degree of freedom is used in a different
meaning. In order to avoid ambiguities, the term pseudo-mobility (already
introduced in previous published work) will be used to denote the number of
scalar parameters needed to identify one single desired deformation, i.e. one
single deformation for which the compliant mechanism is designed. Many
synthesis approaches exist for compliant mechanisms with single pseudo-mobility
(commonly referred to as ""single degree of freedom mechanisms""). In the case of
compliant mechanisms with multiple pseudo-mobility (multiple-degree of freedom
mechanisms), only synthesis approaches for relatively simple mechanisms exist
so far, while systems for more complex tasks like shape adaptation are not
covered. In addition, only certain cases of transverse loads are included in
the synthesis with these approaches. In this paper, a novel optimization
algorithm is presented that addresses these two shortcomings. The algorithm is
tested on a simple mechanism with one translation and one rotation kinematic
degree of freedom, a compliant parallel mechanism for pure translation and a
shape-adaptive structure.

vertices in a graph. While this task has been studied widely in the literature,
most of the existing works only focus on finding homogeneous communities rather
than heterogeneous communities with different labels. In this paper, we
motivate a new problem of cross-group community search, namely Butterfly-Core
Community (BCC), over a labeled graph, where each vertex has a label indicating
its properties and an edge between two vertices indicates their cross
relationship. Specifically, for two query vertices with different labels, we
aim to find a densely connected cross community that contains two query
vertices and consists of butterfly networks, where each wing of the butterflies
is induced by a k-core search based on one query vertex and two wings are
connected by these butterflies. Indeed, the BCC structure admits the structure
cohesiveness and minimum diameter, and thus can effectively capture the
heterogeneous and concise collaborative team. Moreover, we theoretically prove
this problem is NP-hard and analyze its non-approximability. To efficiently
tackle the problem, we develop a heuristic algorithm, which first finds a BCC
containing the query vertices, then iteratively removes the farthest vertices
to the query vertices from the graph. The algorithm can achieve a
2-approximation to the optimal solution. To further improve the efficiency, we
design a butterfly-core index and develop a suite of efficient algorithms for
butterfly-core identification and maintenance as vertices are eliminated.
Extensive experiments on eight real-world networks and four novel case studies
validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.

magnetoelectric coupling coefficient (DME) of composite multiferroic cylinders,
consisted of two mechanically bonded concentric cylinders, was analytically
modeled under the influence of a radially emanating magnetic field. The
analysis framework emphasized the effects of shear lag and demagnetization on
the overall performance. The shear lag effect was analytically proven to have
no bearing on the DME since it has no effect on the induced radial displacement
due to the conditions imposed on the composite cylinder. The demagnetization
effect was also thoroughly considered as a function of the imposed mechanical
boundary conditions, geometrical dimensions of the composite cylinder, and the
introduction of a thin elastic layer at the interface between the inner
piezomagnetic and outer piezoelectric cylinders. The results indicate that the
demagnetization effect adversely impacted the DME coefficient between 70% and
86%. In a trial to compensate for the reduction in peak DME coefficient due to
the presence of demagnetization, non-dimensional geometrical analysis was
carried out to identify the geometrical attributes corresponding to the maximum
DME. It was observed that the peak DME coefficient is nearly unaffected by
varying the inner radius of the composite cylinder, while it approaches its

compared them to baseline CNN encoder and RNN decoder architecture. The goal is
to analyze the performance of each approach using various evaluation metrics
including BLEU, CIDEr, ROUGE and METEOR. We have also explored model
explainability using Visual Attention Maps (VAM) to highlight parts of the

in-home sensory observations and measurements can provide valuable insights
into the health and well-being of individuals. Presents of neuropsychiatric and
psychological symptoms in people with dementia have a significant impact on
their well-being and disease prognosis. Agitation in people with dementia can
be due to many reasons such as pain or discomfort, medical reasons such as side
effects of a medicine, communication problems and environment. This paper
discusses a model for analysing the risk of agitation in people with dementia
and how in-home monitoring data can support them. We proposed a semi-supervised
model which combines a self-supervised learning model and a Bayesian ensemble
classification. We train and test the proposed model on a dataset from a
clinical study. The dataset was collected from sensors deployed in 96 homes of
patients with dementia. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art
models in recall and f1-score values by 20%. The model also indicates better
generalisability compared to the baseline models.

  representation of biomedical signals",,,,,"eess.SP physics.med-ph stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This paper introduces a new time-frequency representation method for
biomedical signals: the dyadic aggregated autoregressive (DASAR) model.
Signals, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs) and functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS), exhibit physiological information through time-evolving
spectrum components at specific frequency intervals: 0-50 Hz (EEG) or 0-150 mHz
(fNIRS). Spectrotemporal features in signals are conventionally estimated using
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT). However, both
methods may not offer the most robust or compact representation despite their
widespread use in biomedical contexts. The presented method, DASAR, improves
precise frequency identification and tracking of interpretable frequency
components with a parsimonious set of parameters. DASAR achieves these
characteristics by assuming that the biomedical time-varying spectrum comprises
several independent stochastic oscillators with (piecewise) time-varying
frequencies. Local stationarity can be assumed within dyadic subdivisions of
the recordings, while the stochastic oscillators can be modeled with an
aggregation of second-order autoregressive models (ASAR). DASAR can provide a
more accurate representation of the (highly contrasted) EEG and fNIRS frequency
ranges by increasing the estimation accuracy in user-defined spectrum region of
interest (SROI). A mental arithmetic experiment on a hybrid EEG-fNIRS was
conducted to assess the efficiency of the method. Our proposed technique, STFT,
and WT were applied on both biomedical signals to discover potential
oscillators that improve the discrimination between the task condition and its
baseline. The results show that DASAR provided the highest spectrum
differentiation and it was the only method that could identify Mayer waves as
narrow-band artifacts at 97.4-97.5 mHz.

allows us to estimate the spectral power density at precise frequencies using
an array of narrow band-pass filters with single complex poles. Closed-form
expressions for the frequency resolution and transient time response of the
proposed filters have also been formulated. In addition, COFRE filters have a
constant time and space complexity allowing their use in real-time
environments. Our model was applied to identify frequency markers that
characterize tinnitus in very-low-frequency oscillations within functional
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals. We examined data from six patients
with subjective tinnitus and seven healthy participants as a control group. A
significant decrease in the spectrum power was observed in tinnitus patients in
the left temporal lobe. In particular, we identified several tinnitus
signatures in the spectral hemodynamic information, including (a.) a
significant spectrum difference in one specific harmonic in the
metabolic/endothelial frequency region, at 7mHz, for both chromophores and
hemispheres; and (b.) a significant differences in the range 30-50mHz in the
neurogenic/myogenic band.

as the number of infected individuals/active cases had increased alarmingly
during the months of May and June 2021 compared to the first wave peak. Indian
government/state governments have been implementing various control measures

reactions. Our analysis had predicted the scenario of the first wave quite
well. In this present article, we extend our analysis to estimate and analyze

individual effort along with governmental actions such as implementations of
curfews, accelerated vaccine strategy are the most important factors to control
the pandemic in the present situation and in the future.

local area network (WLAN), 2.3/3.5/5.5GHz Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access (WiMAX) and Bluetooth applications is proposed and studied in
this paper. The antenna comprises of a L-shaped element which is coupled with a
ground shorted parasitic resonator to generate three resonant modes for
tri-band operation. The L-shaped element which is placed on top of the
substrate is fed by a 50$\Omega$ microstrip feed line and is responsible for
the generation of a wide band at 5.5 GHz. The parasitic resonator is placed on
the other side of the substrate and is directly connected to the ground plane.
The presence of the parasitic resonator gives rise to two additional resonant
bands at 2.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz. Thus, together the two elements generate three
resonant bands to cover WLAN, WiMAX and Bluetooth bands of operation. A
thorough parametric study has been performed on the antenna and it has been
found that the three bands can be tuned by varying certain dimensions of the
antenna. Hence, the same design can be used for frequencies in adjacent bands
as well with minor changes in its dimensions. Important antenna parameters such
as return loss, radiation pattern and peak gains in the operating bands have
been studied in detail to prove that the proposed design is a promising
candidate for the aforementioned wireless technologies.
