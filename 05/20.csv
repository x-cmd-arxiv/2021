clinical applications, where the acquisition of data at high spatial resolution
is desirable. While parallel MRI and constrained image reconstruction
algorithms can accelerate the scans, image reconstruction artifacts are
inevitable, especially at high acceleration factors. We introduce a novel image
domain deep-learning framework for calibrationless parallel MRI reconstruction,
coupled with a segmentation network to improve image quality and to reduce the
vulnerability of current segmentation algorithms to image artifacts resulting
from acceleration. The combination of the proposed image domain deep
calibrationless approach with the segmentation algorithm offers improved image
quality, while increasing the accuracy of the segmentations. The novel
architecture with an encoder shared between the reconstruction and segmentation
tasks is seen to reduce the need for segmented training datasets. In
particular, the proposed few-shot training strategy requires only 10% of
segmented datasets to offer good performance.

  Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-21)",,,,"cs.AI cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a specification $\varphi(X,Y)$ over inputs $X$ and output $Y$, defined
over a background theory $\mathbb{T}$, the problem of program synthesis is to
design a program $f$ such that $Y=f(X)$ satisfies the specification $\varphi$.
Over the past decade, syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) has emerged as a dominant
approach for program synthesis where in addition to the specification
$\varphi$, the end-user also specifies a grammar $L$ to aid the underlying
synthesis engine. This paper investigates the feasibility of synthesis
techniques without grammar, a sub-class defined as $\mathbb{T}$-constrained
synthesis.
  We show that $\mathbb{T}$-constrained synthesis can be reduced to
DQF($\mathbb{T}$), i.e., to the problem of finding a witness of a Dependency
Quantified Formula Modulo Theory. When the underlying theory is the theory of
bitvectors, the corresponding DQF(BV) problem can be further reduced to
Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF). We rely on the progress in DQBF
solving to design DQBF-based synthesizers that outperform the domain-specific
program synthesis techniques, thereby positioning DQBF as a core representation
language for program synthesis. Our empirical analysis shows that
$\mathbb{T}$-constrained synthesis can achieve significantly better performance
than syntax-guided approaches. Furthermore, the general-purpose DQBF solvers
perform on par with domain-specific synthesis techniques.

expensive black-box functions, by using a regression as a surrogate to guide

crucial task. A common goal is to maximize the test power, given a set of
treatments, corresponding effect sizes, and a total number of samples. From a
wide range of possible designs we aim to select the best one in a short time to
allow quick decisions. The standard approach to simulate the power for each

propose to use BO to quickly find a clinical trial design with high power from

and one exact, for solving the PRP-SO. The approximate strategy solves
large-scale instances of the problem with a tabu search-based metaheuristic
coupled with an efficient fixed-sequence speed optimization algorithm. The
second strategy consists of a tailored branch-and-price (BP) algorithm in which
speed optimization is managed within the pricing problem. We test both methods
on modified Solomon benchmarks and newly constructed real-life instance sets.
Our BP algorithm solves most instances with up to 50 customers and many
instances with 75 and 100 customers. The heuristic is able to find near-optimal
solutions to all instances and requires less than one minute of computational
time per instance. Results on real-world instances suggest several managerial
insights. First, fuel savings of up to 53\% are realized when explicitly taking
into account arc payloads and road grades. Second, fuel savings and emissions
reduction are also achieved by scheduling uphill customers later along the
routes. Lastly, we show that ignoring elevation information when planning
routes leads to highly inaccurate fuel consumption estimates.

challenges facing the deployment of ABSs is the inherent limited available
energy of the drone, which limits the hovering time for serving ground users to
the orders of minutes. This impediment deteriorate the performance of the
UAV-enabled cellular network and hinders wide adoption and use of the
technology. In this paper, we propose robotic airborne base stations (RABSs)
with grasping capabilities to increase the serving time of ground users by
multiple orders of magnitude compared to nominal hovering based operation. More
specifically, to perform the grasping task, the RABS is equipped with a
versatile, albeit, general purpose gripper manipulator. Depending on the type
of the gripper RABS can provide service in the range of hours, compared to
minutes of hovering based ABSs. In theory it is possible that grasping can be
energy neutral, hence the time of service can be bounded by the communications
energy consumption. To illustrate the case, energy consumption comparison
between hovering and grasping is performed in order to reveal the significant
benefits of the proposed approach. Finally, overarching challenges, design
considerations for RABS, and future avenues of research are outlined to realize
the full potential of the proposed robotic aerial base stations.

1-methyl-6-oxyquinolinium betaine as chromophore and water as solvent. An
overall retardation of solvent molecules is then obtained by comparison of the
linked system to the same system without trehalose, but contributions from
different subgroups of solvent molecules, for example molecules close to or far

contributions of retarded and possibly unretarded solvent molecules is overcome
in this work by conducting computer simulations on this system and decomposing
the overall signal into contributions from various molecules at different
locations. We performed non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation using a
polarizable water model and a non-polarizable solute model and could reproduce
the experimental time-dependent Stokes shift accurately for the linked
trehalose-oxyquinolinium and the pure oxyquinolinium over a wide temperature
range, indicating the correctness of our employed models. Decomposition of the
shift into contributions from different solvent subgroups showed that the
amplitude of the measured shift is made up only half by the desired retarded
solvent molecules in the hydration layer, but to another half by unretarded
bulk water, so that measured relaxation times of the overall Stokes shift are

large freedom to design strong anomalous Hall effect (AHE) materials. A nodal
line from band inversion is a typical band structure to generate strong AHE.
Whereas, in most collinear antiferromagnets (AFMs), the integration of Berry
curvatures on Brillouin zone is forced to zero by the joint $TO$ symmetry,
where $T$ and $O$ are time reversal and a space group operation, respectively.
Even with inverted band structures, such kind of AFM cannot have AHE.
Therefore, so far, AFM nodal line band structures constructed by spin
degenerated bands didn't get much attentions in AHE materials. In this work, we
illustrate that such kind of band structure indeed provides a promising
starting point to generated strong local Berry curvature by perturbations and,
therefore, strong intrinsic AHE. In specific AFM compounds of
$A$MnBi$_2$($A$=Ca and Yb) with inverted band structure, we found a strong AHE
induced by a weak spin canting, and due to nodal line in the band structure the
anomalous Hall conductivity keeps growing as the canting angle increases. Since
such spin-canting can be adjusted via doping experimentally, it provides
another effective strategy to generate and manipulate strong AHE

the universe during its earliest stages. With a variety of GW detectors being
proposed to operate over a wide range of frequencies, there is great
expectation that observations of primordial GWs can provide us with an
unprecedented window to the physics operating during inflation and reheating.
In this work, we closely examine the effects of the regime of reheating on the
spectrum of primordial GWs observed today. We consider a scenario wherein the
phase of reheating is described by an averaged equation of state (EoS)
parameter with an abrupt transition to radiation domination as well as a
scenario wherein there is a gradual change in the effective EoS parameter to
that of radiation due to the perturbative decay of the inflaton. We show that
the perturbative decay of the inflaton leads to oscillations in the spectrum of
GWs, which, if observed, can possibly help us decipher finer aspects of the
reheating mechanism. We also examine the effects of a secondary phase of
reheating arising due to a brief epoch driven possibly by an exotic,
non-canonical, scalar field. Interestingly, we find that, for suitable values
of the EoS parameter governing the secondary phase of reheating, the GWs can be
of the strength as suggested by the recent NANOGrav observations. We conclude
with a discussion of the wider implications of our analysis.

Leidenfrost effect. The time evolution of the sheet is simultaneously recorded
from top and side views using high-speed cameras. The investigated viscoelastic
fluids are Maxwell fluids, which are characterized by low elastic moduli, and
relaxation times that vary over almost two orders of magnitude, thus giving
access to a large spectrum of viscoelastic and elastocapillary effects. For the
purposes of comparison, Newtonian fluids, with viscosity varying over three
orders of magnitude, are also investigated. In this study, $d_{\mathrm{max}}$,
the maximal expansion of the sheets, and $t_{\mathrm{max}}$ the time to reach
this maximal expansion from the time at impact, are measured as a function of
the impact velocity. By using a generalized damped harmonic oscillator model,
we rationalize the role of capillarity, bulk elasticity and viscous dissipation

constant is a combination of the surface tension and the bulk dynamic elastic
modulus. The time-varying damping coefficient is associated to biaxial
extensional viscous dissipation and is proportional to the dynamic loss

RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. At first, a general
signal model is introduced, which includes the possibility of using up to two

The performance analysis shows the benefits granted by the presence of the RISs

Alfv\'en-wave-driven stellar wind model. We use two stellar wind set-ups: one
more magnetically-dominated and the other more thermally-dominated. Although
our stellar winds have similar magnetic field and velocity profiles, they have
mass-loss rates two orders of magnitude different. Because of this, they give
rise to two different astrosphere sizes, one ten times larger than the other.
The magnetically-dominated wind modulates the Galactic cosmic rays more at
distances < 0.2 au than the thermally-dominated wind due to a higher local wind
velocity. Between 0.2 and 1 au the fluxes for both cases start to converge.
However, for distances > 10 au, spatial diffusion dominates, and the flux of
GeV cosmic rays is almost unmodulated. We find, irrespective of the wind
regime, that the flux of Galactic cosmic rays in the habitable zone of GJ 436

hand, around GJ 436 b (0.028 au), both wind regimes predict Galactic cosmic ray

unexpected. Analysis of the time-dependent Stokes shift obtained from

activation energies, and indicates that solute motion, namely vibration, is
mainly responsible for the observed retardation of solvation dynamics. The
faster dynamics around the smaller chromophore is in fact achieved by some
normal modes located at the pyridinium part of the chromophore. Rotation also
contributes to a very small extent to hydration dynamics, but for small and

retardations in the first solvent shell around the chromophores. The current
picture of the solute acting as a passive molecular probe therefore needs to be

classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We
assess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the
accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the
continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop
types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling
>3M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are
compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The
overall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop
classes and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest
accuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced
accuracies higher than 96%. The correlation between the remotely sensed
estimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99

to the misinterpretation of the observations in a number of occasions. Here, we

parameters measured by the Hubble-flow observers and by their bulk-flow

employ closely analogous theoretical tools, which allows for the direct and

relative-motion effects are generally too weak to make a difference between the
two measurements. In relativity, however, the deceleration parameters measured
in the two frames differ considerably, even at the linear level. This could
deceive the unsuspecting observers to a potentially serious misinterpretation
of the universe's global kinematic status. We also discuss the implications and
the observational viability of the relativistic study.

The popularity of IaaS has led to serious and critical concerns with respect to
the cyber security and privacy. In particular, malware is often leveraged by
malicious entities against cloud services to compromise sensitive data or to
obstruct their functionality. In response to this growing menace, malware
detection for cloud environments has become a widely researched topic with
numerous methods being proposed and deployed. In this paper, we present online

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our analysis conclude that neural network
models can most accurately detect the impact malware have on the process level
features of virtual machines in the cloud, and therefore are best suited to
detect them. Our models were trained, validated, and tested by using a dataset
of 40,680 malicious and benign samples. The dataset was complied by running

traveling waves, governed by a novel modified Kuramoto--Sivashinsky-type
equation derived under the long-wave approximation. The balance between energy
production and dissipation in this long-wave equations allows for the existence
of dissipative solitons. These permanent traveling waves' propagation velocity
and profile shape are shown to be tunable via the external magnetic field. A
multiple-scale analysis is performed to obtain the correction to the linear
prediction of the propagation velocity, and to reveal how the nonlinearity
arrests the linear instability. The traveling periodic interfacial waves
discovered are identified as fixed points in an energy phase plane. It is shown
that transitions between states (wave profiles) occur. These transitions are
explained via the spectral stability of the traveling waves. Interestingly,
multiperiodic waves, which are a non-integrable analog of the double cnoidal
wave, are also found to propagate under the model long-wave equation. These

or not using only the information from unlabelled inlier data, is an important
but challenging task. Recently, methods based on the two-stage framework
achieve state-of-the-art performance on this task. The framework leverages
self-supervised representation learning algorithms to train a feature extractor
on inlier data, and applies a simple outlier detector in the feature space. In
this paper, we explore the possibility of avoiding the high cost of training a
distinct representation for each outlier detection task, and instead using a
single pre-trained network as the universal feature extractor regardless of the
source of in-domain data. In particular, we replace the task-specific feature
extractor by one network pre-trained on ImageNet with a self-supervised loss.
In experiments, we demonstrate competitive or better performance on a variety
of outlier detection benchmarks compared with previous two-stage methods,
suggesting that learning representations from in-domain data may be unnecessary

each jet an Anomaly Score that distinguishes between the structure of signal

$p_{T}$ correlations when compared to methods based primarily on jet
substructure. Performance is evaluated on the jet level, as well as in an
analysis context by searching for a heavy resonance with a final state of two
boosted jets. The Anomaly Score shows consistent performance along a wide range

Score as a classifier enhances signal sensitivity while retaining a smoothly

We fit their Ly$\alpha$ spectra using the shell model, and constrain its

evidences of Ly$\alpha$ suppression in dusty systems, and a fraction of
LAE-LGRBs among the overall LGRB hosts lower than that found for Lyman-break
galaxy (LBG) samples at similar redshift range. However, we find that LAE-LGRBs
are representative of Ly$\alpha$ emission from the bulk of UV-selected galaxies
at z~2. We find that the golden sample of LAE-LGRBs are complex systems
characterized by multiple emission blobs and by signs of possible galaxy

(NHI) measured from the afterglow spectra, and the other properties described
by the shell-model parameters in the cases with very high NHI. The afterglows
of most LGRBs and LAE-LGRBs show high NHI, implying that statistically the bulk
of Ly$\alpha$ photons expected to be produced by massive stars in the
star-forming region hosting the GRB will be surrounded by such opaque lines of
sight. We interpret our results in the context of more sophisticated models and
of different dominant Ly$\alpha$ emitting regions. We also compare LAE-LGRBs to
LAE Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers in the literature in terms of properties
identified as possible indirect indicators of LyC leakage. [Abridged]

polarization observations do not necessarily trace the same magnetic field

154um than at 3 and 6 cm; statistically significant lower values for the
magnetic pitch angle are measured at FIR in the outskirts (R > 7 kpc) of the
galaxy. This difference is not detected in the interarm region. We find strong
correlations of the polarization fraction and total intensity at FIR and radio
with the gas column density and 12CO(1-0) velocity dispersion. We conclude that
the arms show a relative increase of small-scale turbulent B-fields at regions
with increasing column density and dispersion velocities of the molecular gas.
No correlations are found with HI neutral gas. The star formation rate shows a
clear correlation with the radio polarized intensity, which is not found in
FIR, pointing to a small-scale dynamo-driven B-field amplification scenario.
This work shows that multi-wavelength polarization observations are key to
disentangling the interlocked relation between star formation, magnetic fields,

burst that consistently describes the evolution of the central black-hole (BH)
torus system, the propagation of the jet through multi-component merger ejecta,
the transition into free expansion, and the photospheric emission from the
relativistic jet. To this end, we perform a special relativistic
neutrino-hydrodynamics simulation of a viscous BH-torus system, which is formed
about 500ms after the merger and is surrounded by dynamical ejecta as well as
neutron star winds, along with a jet that is injected in the vicinity of the
central BH. In a post-processing step, we compute the photospheric emission
using a relativistic Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. It is found that the
wind from the torus leaves a strong imprint on the jet as well as on the
emission causing narrow collimation and rapid time variability. The viewing
angle dependence of the emission gives rise to correlations among the spectral
peak energy, E_p, isotropic energy, E_iso, and peak luminosity, L_p, which may
provide natural explanations for the Amati- and Yonetoku-relations. We also
find that the degree of polarization is small for the emission from the jet
core (<2%), while it tends to increase with viewing angle outside of the core
and can become as high as ~10-40% for energies larger than the peak energy.
Finally, the comparison of our model with GRB170817A strongly disfavors the
photospheric emission scenario and therefore supports alternative scenarios,
such as the cocoon shock breakout.

excitation of gravity waves within the host star causes the planets' orbits to
decay. We study the effects of tidal resonance locking, in which the planet
locks into resonance with a tidally excited stellar gravity mode. Because a
star's gravity mode frequencies typically increase as the star evolves, the
planet's orbital frequency increases in lockstep, potentially causing much
faster orbital decay than predicted by other tidal theories. Due to nonlinear
mode damping, resonance locking in Sun-like stars likely only operates for
low-mass planets ($M \lesssim 0.1 \, M_{\rm Jup}$), but in stars with
convective cores it can likely operate for all planetary masses. The orbital
decay timescale with resonance locking is typically comparable to the star's
main-sequence lifetime, corresponding to a wide range in effective stellar
quality factor ($10^3 \lesssim Q' \lesssim 10^9$), depending on the planet's
mass and orbital period. We make predictions for several individual systems and
examine the orbital evolution resulting from both resonance locking and
nonlinear wave dissipation. Our models demonstrate how short-period massive

reveal each region's star formation history. The patterns we reveal include an
apparent star formation origin for Sco-Cen along a semicircular arc, as well as
clear evidence for sequential star formation moving away from that arc with a
propagation speed of $\sim$4 km s$^{-1}$ ($\sim$4 pc Myr$^{-1}$). We also
identify earlier bursts of star formation in Perseus and Taurus that predate
current, kinematically identical active star-forming events, suggesting that
the mechanisms that collect gas can spark multiple generations of star
formation, punctuated by gas dispersal and cloud regrowth. The large spatial
scales and long temporal scales on which we observe star formation offer a
bridge between the processes within individual molecular clouds and the broad
forces guiding star formation at galactic scales.

whether a given language belongs to the fixed class of languages. Secondly, the
separation problem asks for two given languages whether they can be separated
by a language from the fixed class. And thirdly, the covering problem is a
generalization of separation problem to more than two given languages. Most
instances of such problems were solved by the connection of regular languages

framework.
  We apply this framework to the Trotter-Weil hierarchy and both the full and

consequence, we solve the covering problem for the resulting subvarieties of

First, we directly train a backtranslation model on all functions from 200K
repositories. Next, we focus on 10K repositories for which we can execute
tests, and create buggy versions of all functions in those repositories that
are covered by passing tests. This provides us with rich debugging information
such as stack traces and print statements, which we use to finetune our model
which was pretrained on raw source code. Finally, we strengthen all our models
by expanding the context window beyond the buggy function itself, and adding a
skeleton consisting of that function's parent class, imports, signatures,
docstrings, and method bodies, in order of priority. On the QuixBugs benchmark,
we increase the total number of fixes found by over 50%, while also decreasing

hours to one minute. On our own benchmark of executable tests, our model fixes

traces it fixes 75% on first attempt. We will open-source our framework and

higher-dimensional simplicial complexes. In contrast to expander graphs, only a
handful of high-dimensional expander constructions have been proposed, and no
elementary combinatorial construction with near-optimal expansion is known. In
this paper, we introduce an improved combinatorial high-dimensional expander
construction, by modifying a previous construction of Liu, Mohanty, and Yang
(ITCS 2020), which is based on a high-dimensional variant of a tensor product.
Our construction achieves a spectral gap of $\Omega(\frac{1}{k^2})$ for random
walks on the $k$-dimensional faces, which is only quadratically worse than the
optimal bound of $\Theta(\frac{1}{k})$. Previous combinatorial constructions,
including that of Liu, Mohanty, and Yang, only achieved a spectral gap that is
exponentially small in $k$. We also present reasoning that suggests our
construction is optimal among similar product-based constructions.

polarization of SrMnO$_3$ (SMO) thin films using density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. This is motivated by indications that ferroelectricity in
complex oxides can be engineered by epitaxial strain but also \textit{via} the
defect chemistry. Our results suggest that intrinsic doping by cation and anion
divacancies can induce a local polarization in unstrained non-polar SMO thin
films and that a ferroelectric state can be stabilized below the critical
strain of the stoichiometric material. This polarity is promoted by the
electric dipole associated with the defect pair and its coupling to the atomic
relaxations upon defect formation that polarize a region around the defect.
This suggests that polar defect pairs affect the strain-dependent
ferroelectricity in semiconducting antiferromagnetic SMO. For metallic
ferromagnetic SMO we find a much weaker coupling between the defect dipole and
the polarization due to much stronger electronic screening. Coupling of
defect-pair dipoles at high enough concentrations along with their switchable
orientation thus makes them a promising route to affect the ferroelectric
transition in complex transition metal oxide thin films.

couple the topological modes to the out-of-plane response, we assemble a
bilayer lattice by stacking a thick topological kagome layer onto a thin

out-of-plane character is controlled by the edge modes of the topological

can propagate out of the lattice plane. These BICs possess an invariant
topological charge given by the winding number of the polarization vectors,

polaritons, hybrid light-matter excitations, occuring in a BIC thanks to its
peculiar non-radiative nature. The combination of the ultra-long BIC lifetime
and the tight confinement of the waveguide geometry allow to achieve an
extremely low threshold density for condensation, which is not reached in the
dispersion minimum but at a saddle point in reciprocal space. By bridging
bosonic condensation and symmetry-protected radiation eigenmodes, we unveil new
ways of imparting topological properties onto macroscopic quantum states with

we here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients.
Specifically, we investigate Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack
to extract the labels of the users' training data from their shared gradients.
The attack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the
presence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of
leaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well
to arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We mathematically and
empirically demonstrate the validity of the attack under different settings.
Moreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with
high accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different
defense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient
compression is a practical technique to mitigate the attack.

traditional gluon-gluon fusion or quark-antiquark annihilation mechanisms
calculated in the $k_T$-factorization approach nor their counterparts from the
collinear next-to-leading order collinear framework are sufficient to describe
the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of $D^0/{\bar D}^0$ mesons.
First the $c{\bar c}$-pair production within the standard frameworks is
considered. Here a crucial role of the $c \to D$ hadronization effects at low
energies and low transverse momenta is found and discussed, which was not
analyzed in previous studies. A contribution related to intrinsic $c \bar c$
component in the nucleon wave function is included in addition. Two models of
the symmetric ($c(x) = \bar c(x)$) intrinsic charm (IC) component are
considered. The intrinsic charm $g^* c \to g c$ (or $g^* {\bar c} \to g {\bar
c}$) contribution needs to be regularized in order to obtain a suppression of
the minijet $p_{T}$ spectrum present in the phenomenological minijet model,
commonly used in Monte Carlo generators. We show that in our model the
regularization parameter can be obtained from the fit to the LHCb fixed-target
data under consideration here. We discuss uncertainties of our calculations
(scale, charm quark mass, fragmentation function) as well as set limits on the

robot can learn to navigate using only ego centric video collected by a
demonstrator, even in the presence of viewpoint mismatch. To this end, we

the generalized second-price auction, the auctioneer can design the information
flow regarding the click-through rates among the bidders. A natural requirement
in this context is to ask for the information structure to be calibrated in the

the task of designing an optimal information structure is thus reduced to the
task of designing an optimal unbiased estimator.
  We show that in a symmetric setting with uncertainty about the click-through

star and the formation of a relativistic jet. As the jet propagates through the
star, it forms an extended, hot cocoon. The dynamical evolution of the
jet/cocoon system and its interaction with the environment has been studied
extensively both analytically and numerically. On the other hand, the role
played by the supernova (SN) explosion associated with LGRBs in determining the
outcome of the system has been barely considered. In this paper, we discuss the
large landscape of outcomes resulting from the interaction of the SN, jet and
cocoon. We show that the outcome depends mainly on three timescales: the times
for the cocoon and supernova shock wave to break through the surface of the
progenitor star, and the time needed for the cocoon to engulf completely the
progenitor star. The delay between the launch of the SN shock moving through
the progenitor star and the jet can be related to these three timescales.
Depending on the ordering of these time scales, the jet-cocoon might propagate
inside the SN ejecta or the other way around, and the outcome for the
properties of the explosion would be different. We discuss the imprint of the

low-level rewrites to hardware targets inexpressible, or \textit{low-level but

Glenside, a pure IR whose core abstraction -- the \textit{access pattern} --
enables low-level, layout-aware, hardware-centric program rewrites.
  We demonstrate how term rewriting in Glenside can be used to map program

  Medicine",,"10.1002/mrm.29100",,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Purpose: To develop an algorithm for robust partial Fourier (PF)
reconstruction applicable to diffusion-weighted (DW) images with non-smooth
phase variations.
  Methods: Based on an unrolled proximal splitting algorithm, a neural network
architecture is derived which alternates between data consistency operations
and regularization implemented by recurrent convolutions. In order to exploit
correlations, multiple repetitions of the same slice are jointly reconstructed
under consideration of permutation-equivariance. The algorithm is trained on DW
liver data of 60 volunteers and evaluated on retrospectively and prospectively
sub-sampled data of different anatomies and resolutions.
  Results: The proposed method is able to significantly outperform conventional
PF techniques on retrospectively sub-sampled data in terms of quantitative
measures as well as perceptual image quality. In this context, joint
reconstruction of repetitions as well as the particular type of recurrent
network unrolling are found to be beneficial with respect to reconstruction
quality. On prospectively PF-sampled data, the proposed method enables DW
imaging with higher signal without sacrificing image resolution or introducing
additional artifacts. Alternatively, it can be used to counter the TE increase
in acquisitions with higher resolution. Further, generalizability can be shown
to prospective brain data exhibiting anatomies and contrasts not present in the
training set.
  Conclusion: This work demonstrates that robust PF reconstruction of DW data
is feasible even at strong PF factors in anatomies prone to phase variations.
Since the proposed method does not rely on smoothness priors of the phase but
uses learned recurrent convolutions instead, artifacts of conventional PF
methods can be avoided.

Early intervention of sepsis can improve clinical outcomes for sepsis patients.
Machine learning models have been developed for clinical recognition of sepsis.
A common assumption of supervised machine learning models is that the
covariates in the testing data follow the same distributions as those in the
training data. When this assumption is violated (e.g., there is covariate
shift), models that performed well for training data could perform badly for
testing data. Covariate shift happens when the relationships between covariates
and the outcome stay the same, but the marginal distributions of the covariates
differ among training and testing data. Covariate shift could make clinical
risk prediction model nongeneralizable. In this study, we applied covariate
shift corrections onto common machine learning models and have observed that
these corrections can help the models be more generalizable under the
occurrence of covariate shift when detecting the onset of sepsis.

$\delta$ between $\delta=0$ for the instant form dynamics (IFD) and
$\delta=\pi/4$ for the light-front dynamics (LFD). With this parameter
$\delta$, we formulate the interpolating mass gap equation which takes into
account the non-trivial vacuum effect on the bare fermion mass to find the
dressed fermion mass. Our interpolating mass gap solutions link the IFD and LFD
results with the $\delta$ parameter. We find the interpolation angle
independent characteristic energy function which satisfies the energy-momentum
dispersion relation of the dressed fermion, identifying the renormalized
fermion mass function and the wave function renormalization factor. Using the
dressed fermion propagator interpolating between IFD and LFD, we derive the
corresponding quark-antiquark bound-state equation in the interpolating
formulation. The mass spectra of mesons bearing the feature of the Regge
trajectories are found independent of the $\delta$-parameter for the equal mass
quark and antiquark bound-states. The Gell-Mann - Oakes - Renner relation for
the pionic ground-state in the zero fermion mass limit is confirmed indicating
that the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry occurs regardless of the
quantization for $0 \le \delta \le \pi/4$. We obtain the corresponding
bound-state wave functions and discuss their reference frame dependence.
Applying them for the computation of the so-called quasi parton distribution
functions, we note a possibility of utilizing not only the reference frame
dependence but also the interpolation angle dependence to get an alternative

thermography and wetting sensitive total internal reflection imaging under
carefully selected experimental conditions, impact Weber number < 10 and
droplet diameter < capillary length, using an indium-tin-oxide coated sapphire

are investigated in altering near-wall turbulence. The TRM has been previously
proposed by \citet{Lacis2020} as a means of representing the net effect of
surface micro-textures on their overlying bulk flows. It encompasses
conventional Navier-slip boundary conditions relating the streamwise and
spanwise velocities to their respective shears through the slip lengths
$\ell_x$ and $\ell_z$. In addition, it features a transpiration condition
accounting for the changes induced in the wall-normal velocity by expressing it
in terms of variations of the wall-parallel velocity shears through the
transpiration lengths $m_x$ and $m_z$. Greater levels of drag increase occur
when more transpiration takes place at the boundary plane, with turbulent
transpiration being predominately coupled to the spanwise shear component for
canonical near-wall turbulence. The TRM can reproduce the effect of a
homogeneous and structured roughness up to ${k^+}\,{\approx18}$. In this
transitionally rough flow regime, the transpiration lengths of the TRM must be
empirically determined. The \emph{transpiration factor} is defined as the
product between the slip and transpiration lengths, i.e. $(m\ell)_{x,z}$. This
factor contains the compound effect of the wall-parallel velocity occurring at
the boundary plane and increased permeability, both of which lead to the
transport of momentum in the wall-normal direction. A linear relation between
the transpiration factor and the roughness function is observed for regularly
textured surfaces in the transitionally rough regime of turbulence. The
relations obtained between the transpiration factor and the roughness function
show that such effective flow quantities can be suitable measures for
characterizing rough surfaces in this flow regime.

generalization of existing tools to networks with multiple subsystems and
layers of connectivity. These kind of networks are usually called multilayer
networks. Multilayer networks in which each layer shares at least one node with
some other layer in the network are called multiplex networks. Being a
multiplex network does not require all nodes to exist on every layer. In this
paper, we built a criminal multiplex network which concerns an anti-mafia
operation called ""Montagna"" and it is based on the examination of a pre-trial
detention order issued on March 14, 2007 by the judge for preliminary
investigations of the Court of Messina (Sicily). ""Montagna"" focus on two Mafia
families called ""Mistretta"" and ""Batanesi"" who infiltrated several economic
activities including the public works in the north-eastern part of Sicily,
through a cartel of entrepreneurs close to the Sicilian Mafia. Originally we
derived two single-layer networks, the former capturing meetings between
suspected individuals and the latter recording phone calls. But some networked
systems can be better modeled by multilayer structures where the individual
nodes develop relationships in multiple layers. For this reason we built a
two-layer network from the single-layer ones. These two layers share 47 nodes.
We followed three different approaches to measure the importance of nodes in
multilayer networks using degree as descriptor. Our analysis can aid in the
identification of key players in criminal networks.

dynamical behavior presenting difficulties for simulation and analysis.
However, if the collective dynamics lie on a low-dimensional manifold then the
original agent-based model may be approximated with a simplified surrogate
model on and near the low-dimensional space where the dynamics live. This is
typically accomplished by deriving coarse variables that summarize the
collective dynamics, these may take the form of either a collection of scalars
or continuous fields (e.g. densities), which are then used as part of a reduced
model. Analytically identifying such simplified models is challenging and has
traditionally been accomplished through the use of mean-field reductions or an
Ott-Antonsen ansatz, but is often impossible.
  Here we present a data-driven coarse-graining methodology for discovering
such reduced models. We consider two types of reduced models: globally-based
models which use global information and predict dynamics using information from
the whole ensemble, and locally-based models that use local information, that
is, information from just a subset of agents close (close in heterogeneity
space, not physical space) to an agent, to predict the dynamics of an agent.
For both approaches we are able to learn laws governing the behavior of the
reduced system on the low-dimensional manifold directly from time series of
states from the agent-based system. A nontrivial conclusion is that the
dynamics can be equally well reproduced by an all-to-all coupled as well as by
a locally coupled model of the same agents.

that an untrustworthy or compromised aggregation process might lead to
unforeseeable information leakage. This challenge is especially acute due to
recently demonstrated attacks that have reconstructed large fractions of
training data from ostensibly ""sanitized"" model updates.
  In this paper, we introduce TRUDA, a new cross-silo FL system, employing a
trustworthy and decentralized aggregation architecture to break down
information concentration with regard to a single aggregator. Based on the
unique computational properties of model-fusion algorithms, all exchanged model
updates in TRUDA are disassembled at the parameter-granularity and re-stitched
to random partitions designated for multiple TEE-protected aggregators. Thus,
each aggregator only has a fragmentary and shuffled view of model updates and
is oblivious to the model architecture. Our new security mechanisms can
fundamentally mitigate training reconstruction attacks, while still preserving
the final accuracy of trained models and keeping performance overheads low.

often facing the challenge of complex heterogeneity. The newly collected data

Although state-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling complex heterogeneity
with sufficient label information, such label information can be quite
expensive to obtain in real applications. Recently, researchers pay great
attention to contrastive learning due to its prominent performance by utilizing
rich unlabeled data. However, existing work on contrastive learning is not able
to address the problem of false negative pairs, i.e., some `negative' pairs may
have similar representations if they have the same label. To overcome the
issues, in this paper, we propose a unified heterogeneous learning framework,
which combines both the weighted unsupervised contrastive loss and the weighted
supervised contrastive loss to model multiple types of heterogeneity. We first
provide a theoretical analysis showing that the vanilla contrastive learning
loss easily leads to the sub-optimal solution in the presence of false negative
pairs, whereas the proposed weighted loss could automatically adjust the weight
based on the similarity of the learned representations to mitigate this issue.
Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and
the efficiency of the proposed framework modeling multiple types of

affecting planet formation, and it is widely accepted that it happens on
timescales of a few million years for disks around single stars. Over the last
years, several protoplanetary disks have been discovered in multiple star
systems, and despite the complex environment in which they find themselves,
some of them seem to be quite old, a situation that may favor planet formation.
A clear example of this is the disk around HD 98800 B, a binary in a
hierarchical quadruple stellar system, which at a $\sim$10 Myr age seems to
still be holding significant amounts of gas. Here we present a 1D+1D model to
compute the vertical structure and gas evolution of circumbinary disks in
hierarchical triple star systems considering different stellar and disk
parameters.
  We show that tidal torques due to the inner binary together with the
truncation of the disk due to the external companion strongly reduce the
viscous accretion and expansion of the disk. Even allowing viscous accretion by
tidal streams, disks in these kind of environments can survive for more than 10
Myr, depending on their properties, with photoevaporation being the main gas
dissipation mechanism. We particularly apply our model to the circumbinary disk
around HD 98800 B and confirm that its longevity, along with the current
non-existence of a disk around the companion binary HD 98800 A, can be
explained with our model and by this mechanism.

considered. With proper rescaling, the model is portrayed as a singularly
perturbed system with fast prey dynamics and slow dynamics of the predators. In
a parameter regime near singular Hopf bifurcation, chaotic mixed-mode
oscillations (MMOs), featuring concatenation of small and large amplitude
oscillations are observed as long-lasting transients before the system
approaches its asymptotic state. To analyze the dynamical cause that initiates
a large amplitude oscillation in an MMO orbit, the model is reduced to a
suitable normal form near the singular-Hopf point. The normal form possesses a
separatrix surface that separates two different types of oscillations. A large
amplitude oscillation is initiated if a trajectory moves from the ""inner"" to
the ""outer side"" of this surface. A set of conditions on the normal form
variables are obtained to determine whether a trajectory would exhibit another
cycle of MMO dynamics before experiencing a regime shift (i.e. approaching its

the search for optimal solutions for instances of a given computational
problem. A recent trend of research in artificial intelligence, called solution
diversity, has focused on the development of notions of optimality that may be
more appropriate in settings where subjectivity is essential. The idea is that
instead of aiming at the development of algorithms that output a single optimal
solution, the goal is to investigate algorithms that output a small set of
sufficiently good solutions that are sufficiently diverse from one another. In
this way, the user has the opportunity to choose the solution that is most
appropriate to the context at hand. It also displays the richness of the
solution space.
  When combined with techniques from parameterized complexity theory, the
paradigm of diversity of solutions offers a powerful algorithmic framework to
address problems of practical relevance. In this work, we investigate the
impact of this combination in the field of Kemeny Rank Aggregation, a
well-studied class of problems lying in the intersection of order theory and
social choice theory and also in the field of order theory itself. In
particular, we show that the Kemeny Rank Aggregation problem is fixed-parameter
tractable with respect to natural parameters providing natural formalizations
of the notions of diversity and of the notion of a sufficiently good solution.

aggregation over linearly ordered votes, and in the more general setting where
votes are partially ordered.

proposed in [C. Liu et al.,J. Comput. Phys., 436, 110253, 2021] for a

constructed based on a recently developed energetic variational formulation, in
which the reaction part is reformulated in terms of the reaction trajectory,
and both the reaction and diffusion parts dissipate the same free energy. The
scheme is energy stable and positivity-preserving. In this paper, the detailed
convergence analysis and error estimate are performed for the operator
splitting scheme. The nonlinearity in the reaction trajectory equation, as well
as the implicit treatment of nonlinear and singular logarithmic terms, impose
challenges in numerical analysis. To overcome these difficulties, we make use
of the convex nature of the logarithmic nonlinear terms, which are treated
implicitly in the chemical reaction stage. In addition, a combination of a
rough error estimate and a refined error estimate leads to a desired bound of
the numerical error in the reaction stage, in the discrete maximum norm.
Furthermore, a discrete maximum principle yields the evolution bound of the
numerical error function at the diffusion stage. As a direct consequence, a
combination of the numerical error analysis at different stages and the
consistency estimate for the operator splitting results in the convergence
estimate of the numerical scheme for the full reaction-diffusion system.

that the data level and the schema level of an application should be developed
independently, thus allowing for maximum flexibility in the reuse of the prior
knowledge, but under the overall guidance of the needs to be satisfied,

all the requirements, including those concerning reuse, as part of an a-priori

a Compton-thick AGN. The HST image in the F658N filter (H$\alpha$) reveals an

prediction. However, providing fine-grained, accurate, time-efficient, and
adaptive traffic speed prediction for a growing transportation network where
the size of the network keeps increasing and new traffic detectors are
constantly deployed has not been well studied. To address this issue, this
paper presents DistTune based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the
Nelder-Mead method. Whenever encountering an unprocessed detector, DistTune
decides if it should customize an LSTM model for this detector by comparing the
detector with other processed detectors in terms of the normalized traffic
speed patterns they have observed. If similarity is found, DistTune directly
shares an existing LSTM model with this detector to achieve time-efficient
processing. Otherwise, DistTune customizes an LSTM model for the detector to
achieve fine-grained prediction. To make DistTune even more time-efficient,
DistTune performs on a cluster of computing nodes in parallel. To achieve
adaptive traffic speed prediction, DistTune also provides LSTM re-customization
for detectors that suffer from unsatisfactory prediction accuracy due to for
instance traffic speed pattern change. Extensive experiments based on traffic
data collected from freeway I5-N in California are conducted to evaluate the
performance of DistTune. The results demonstrate that DistTune provides
fine-grained, accurate, time-efficient, and adaptive traffic speed prediction

movements over the last decade have caused an aggressive re-emergence of dengue
fever, which made it the subject of several research fields. In this regard,
mathematical modeling, and notably through compartmental systems, is considered
as an eminent tool to obtain a clear overview of this disease's prevalence
behavior. In reality, and like all epidemics, the dengue spread phenomenon is
often subject to some randomness due to the different natural environment
fluctuations. For this reason, a mathematical formulation that considers
suitably as much as possible the external stochasticity is indeed required. By
this token, we strive in this work to present and analyze a generalized
stochastic dengue model that incorporates both slight and huge environmental
perturbations. More precisely, our proposed model is represented under the form
of an It\^o-L\'evy stochastic differential equations system that we demonstrate
its mathematical well-posedness and biological significance. Based on some
novel analytical techniques, we prove, and under appropriate hypothetical
frameworks, of course, two important asymptotic properties, namely: extinction
and persistence in the mean. The theoretical findings show that the dynamics of
our disturbed dengue model are mainly determined by the parameters that are
narrowly related to the small perturbations' intensities and the jumps
magnitudes. In the end, we give certain numerical illustrative examples to
support our theoretical findings and to highlight the effect of the adopted

interactions in different 1D Burgers and 3D Navier-Stokes flows. This analysis
is focused on preferential alignments characterizing the phases of Fourier
modes participating in triadic interactions, which are key to determining the
nature of energy fluxes between different scales. We develop novel diagnostic
tools designed to probe the level of coherence among triadic interactions
realizing different flow scenarios. We consider extreme 1D viscous Burgers
flows and 3D Navier-Stokes flows which are complemented by singularity-forming
inviscid Burgers flows as well as viscous Burgers flows and Navier-Stokes flows
corresponding to generic turbulent and simple unimodal initial data, such as
the Taylor-Green vortex. The main finding is that while the extreme viscous
Burgers and Navier-Stokes flows reveal the same relative level of enstrophy
amplification by nonlinear effects, this behaviour is realized via modal
interactions with vastly different levels of coherence. In the viscous Burgers
flows the flux-carrying triads have phase values which saturate the
nonlinearity thereby maximizing the energy flux towards small scales. On the
other hand, in 3D Navier-Stokes flows with the extreme initial data the energy
flux to small scales is realized by a very small subset of helical triads. The
second main finding concerns the role of initial coherence. Comparison of the
flows resulting from the extreme and generic initial conditions shows striking
similarities between these two types of flows, for the 1D viscous Burgers
equation as well as the 3D Navier-Stokes equation.

simulation except in certain special edge cases, since the L\'{e}vy density
associated with the GIG process is expressed as an integral involving certain
Bessel Functions, known as the Jaeger integral in diffusive transport
applications. We here show for the first time how to solve the problem
indirectly, using generalised shot-noise methods to simulate the underlying
point processes and constructing an auxiliary variables approach that avoids
any direct calculation of the integrals involved. The resulting augmented
bivariate process is still intractable and so we propose a novel thinning
method based on upper bounds on the intractable integrand. Moreover our
approach leads to lower and upper bounds on the Jaeger integral itself, which
may be compared with other approximation methods. The shot noise method
involves a truncated infinite series of decreasing random variables, and as
such is approximate, although the series are found to be rapidly convergent in
most cases. We note that the GIG process is the required Brownian motion
subordinator for the generalised hyperbolic (GH) L\'{e}vy process and so our
simulation approach will straightforwardly extend also to the simulation of

astrophysical situations. Unlike circular orbit disks, the vertical gravity in
eccentric disks varies around the orbit. In this paper, we investigate some of
the dynamical effects of this varying gravity on the vertical structure using
$1D$ hydrodynamics simulations of individual gas columns assumed to be mutually
non-interacting. We find that time-dependent gravitational pumping generically
creates shocks near pericenter; the energy dissipated in the shocks is taken
from the orbital energy. Because the kinetic energy per unit mass in vertical
motion near pericenter can be large compared to the net orbital energy, the
shocked gas can be heated to nearly the virial temperature, and some of it
becomes unbound. These shocks affect larger fractions of the disk mass for
larger eccentricity and/or disk aspect ratio. If the orbit can be maintained
despite orbital energy loss, diverse initial structures evolve in only a few
orbits so that they follow a limit-cycle characterized by a low-entropy
midplane and a much higher entropy outer layer. In favorable cases (such as the
tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes), these effects could be
a potentially important energy dissipation and mass loss mechanism.

However, this assumption is rarely met in real settings. Besides, there is no
single model that can remove various noise types from documents. Here, we
propose a unified end-to-end unsupervised deep learning model, for the first

pepper noise, blurred and/or faded text, as well as watermarks from documents
at various levels of intensity. We demonstrate that the proposed model

graph with a weight and a capacity function on its edges, and a set of its
subgraphs along with a degree upper bound function for each of them. We are
also given a laminar system on the node set with an upper bound on the
degree-sum in each member of the system. Our goal is to assign each edge a
non-negative integer below its capacity such that the total weight is
maximized, the degrees in each subgraph are below the associated degree upper
bound, and the degree-sum bound is respected in each member of the laminar
system.
  We identify special cases when the problem is solvable in polynomial time.
One of these cases is a common generalization of the hierarchical $b$-matching
problem and the laminar matchoid problem. This implies that both problems can
be solved efficiently in the weighted, capacitated case even if both lower and
upper bounds are present -- generalizing the previous polynomial-time
algorithms. The problem is solvable for trees provided that the laminar system
is empty and a natural assumption holds for the subgraphs.
  The general problem, however, is shown to be APX-hard in the unweighted case,
which implies that the $d$-distance matching problem is APX-hard. Furthermore,
we prove that the approximation guarantee of any polynomial-time algorithm must
increase linearly in the number of the given subgraphs unless P=NP. We give a
generic framework for deriving approximation algorithms, which can be applied
to a wide range of problems. As an application to our problem, a
constant-approximation algorithm is derived when the number of the subgraphs is
a constant. The approximation guarantee is the same as the integrality gap of a
strengthened LP-relaxation when the number of the subgraphs is small. Improved
approximation algorithms are given when the degree bounds are uniform or the
graph is sparse.

However, in non-translationally symmetric systems such as nanostructures,
plasmons and SPEs coherently interact. It has been well discussed that the
plasmons and SPEs, respectively, can couple with transverse (T) electric field

longitudinal (L) field. However, there has been a missing link in the previous
studies: the coherent coupling between the plasmons and SPEs mediated by the T

densities in a constitutive equation with a nonlocal susceptibility, where the
densities include the L and T components. The electromagnetic fields
originating from the densities are described in terms of the Green's function

the L component is attributed to the charge density only. We introduce a
four-vector representation incorporating the vector and scalar potentials in
the Coulomb gauge, in which the T and L fields are separated explicitly. The
eigenvalues of the matrix for the self-consistent equations appear as the poles
of the system excitations. The developed formulation enables to approach

how the electronic band structures are modulated by the MQ ordering in the

spin-orbital momentum locking is related with the microscopic origin of
cross-correlated phenomena, e.g., the magnetic-field-induced symmetric and

on observations of the agent. It is of pivotal importance to design effective
visual representations of the observed scene in determining navigation actions.
In this paper, we introduce a Visual Transformer Network (VTNet) for learning
informative visual representation in navigation. VTNet is a highly effective
structure that embodies two key properties for visual representations: First,
the relationships among all the object instances in a scene are exploited;
Second, the spatial locations of objects and image regions are emphasized so
that directional navigation signals can be learned. Furthermore, we also
develop a pre-training scheme to associate the visual representations with
navigation signals, and thus facilitate navigation policy learning. In a
nutshell, VTNet embeds object and region features with their location cues as
spatial-aware descriptors and then incorporates all the encoded descriptors
through attention operations to achieve informative representation for
navigation. Given such visual representations, agents are able to explore the
correlations between visual observations and navigation actions. For example,
an agent would prioritize ""turning right"" over ""turning left"" when the visual
representation emphasizes on the right side of activation map. Experiments in
the artificial environment AI2-Thor demonstrate that VTNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unseen testing environments.

We call each such MDP a context. Most related works make strong assumptions

unforeseen changes to a context are detected, thereby allowing for rapid

order to minimize regret. Our method constructs a mixture model composed of a

wavemakers (moving paddles) acting on the surface of the water. Although
practical for engineering purposes, wavemakers have issues: they perform poorly
in the generation of long waves and create evanescent waves in their vicinity.
In this article, we introduce a framework for wave generation through the
action of an underwater multipoint mechanism: the pedal-wavemaking method. Our
multipoint action makes each point of the bottom move with a prescribed
pedalling-like motion. We analyse the linear response of waves in a uniform
channel in terms of the wavelength of the bottom action. The framework
naturally solves the problem of the performance for long waves and replaces
evanescent waves by thin boundary layer at the bottom of the channel. We also
show that a proper synchronisation of orbital motion on the bottom can produce
waves that mimic deep water waves. This last feature has been proved to be
useful to study fluid-structure interaction in simulations based on smoothed
particle hydrodynamics.

found in the Sun are produced by rapid neutron capture and half by slow neutron
capture, the r- and s-processes. In the Sun, their relative contribution to
individual elemental abundances is well understood, except for the lightest and
heaviest elements beyond iron. Their contributions are especially uncertain for
the heaviest non-radioactive element, lead (Pb, Z=82). This is constrained by
deriving lead abundances in metal-poor stars. For in the most metal-poor halo
stars, strontium and heavier elements are found in the solar r-process
proportion; s-process elements appear only at metallicities above one-thirtieth
solar.
  In unevolved metal-poor stars of roughly solar heavy-element content, only
two UV Pb lines are detectable. Four such stars have high-resolution spectra of
the strongest line, Pb II at 2203.53A. Roederer et al. (2020) analyzed this
line in one star, deriving a lead-to-iron abundance ratio ten times solar. This
and its blue-shifted profile suggested strong s-process production.
  This work analyzes the UV spectra of all four stars. Calculations including a
predicted Fe I line blueward of the Pb II line, and assuming the lead abundance
scales with r-process abundances, match all four profiles extremely well. A
scaled s-process contribution might improve the match to the much lower lead
abundance found in the unevolved star analyzed previously, but its s-process
excess is modest. An Fe II line blends the other lead line, Pb I at 2833.05A,
which constrains the lead abundance only in the coolest star.

unintuitive forces and demand delicate position-based control that exceeds the

localization a necessity. Our localization method combines neural network-based
segmentation and classical techniques, and we are able to consistently locate
our needle with 0.73 mm RMS error in clean environments and 2.72 mm RMS error
in challenging environments with blood and occlusion. The average localization
RMS error is 2.16 mm for all environments we used in the experiments. We
combine this localization method with our closed-loop feedback control system
to demonstrate the further applicability of localization to autonomous control.
Our needle is able to follow a running suture path in (1) no blood, no tissue;
(2) heavy blood, no tissue; (3) no blood, with tissue; and (4) heavy blood,
with tissue environments. The tip position tracking error ranges from 2.6 mm to

Through analysis on transfer learning based methods, some neglected but
beneficial properties are utilized to design a simple yet effective few-shot

pretrained RPN and Re-detector to find few-shot class objects without
forgetting previous knowledge. Extensive experiments on few-shot detection
benchmarks show that Retentive R-CNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

within the realm of data mining and science discovery over the past few years.
This problem remains an attempt to identify future, deleted, and redundant
links using the existing links in a graph. Local random walk is considered to
be one of the most well-known algorithms in the category of quasi-local
methods. It traverses the network using the traditional random walk with a
limited number of steps, randomly selecting one adjacent node in each step
among the nodes which have equal importance. Then this method uses the
transition probability between node pairs to calculate the similarity between
them. However, in most datasets, this method is not able to perform accurately
in scoring remarkably similar nodes. In the present article, an efficient
method is proposed for improving local random walk by encouraging random walk
to move, in every step, towards the node which has a stronger influence.
Therefore, the next node is selected according to the influence of the source
node. To do so, using mutual information, the concept of the asymmetric mutual
influence of nodes is presented. A comparison between the proposed method and
other similarity-based methods (local, quasi-local, and global) has been
performed, and results have been reported for 11 real-world networks. It had a
higher prediction accuracy compared with other link prediction approaches.

However, these methods become infeasible in the case of large-scale assessments

estimation algorithm for the DINA Q-matrix by constructing an iteration

simulation and empirical studies reveal that the proposed method achieves
high-speed computation, good accuracy, and robustness to potential

biometric authentication methods. In this work, we propose a two-level
integrated authentication mechanism (2L-IAM). At the first level, the user logs
in to their IB portal using either PIN or FPM. At the second level, user is
authenticated by means of face recognition (FR) should they initiate a
transaction classified as sensitive. The merits of the introduced 2L-IAM are
3-fold: - (1) FR guarantees the identity of the rightful user irrespective of
the login device; (2) By classifying banking products sensitivity, the
sensitive transactions are more effectively secured; (3) It is accommodative of
different users authentication preferences. Adoption of this framework could

two optimization-based centralized pilot allocation schemes with the primary
goal of benchmarking the RSA-based scheme. The first centralized scheme is
based only on the user locations (just like the RSA-based scheme) and
partitions the users into sets of co-pilot users such that the minimum distance
between two users in a partition is maximized. The second centralized scheme
takes both user and remote radio head (RRH) locations into account and provides
a near-optimal solution in terms of sum-user spectral efficiency (SE). The
general idea is to first cluster the users with similar propagation conditions
with respect to the RRHs using spectral graph theory and then ensure that the
users in each cluster are assigned different pilots using the branch and price

efficiency (SFE) is very important to know about the star-formation history. In
N-body models of star cluster evolution after gas expulsion, the Plummer model
with outer power law density profile has been used massively. We study the
impact of the density profile slopes on the survivability of the low-SFE star
clusters after instantaneous gas expulsion. We compare cases when stellar
cluster has Plummer profile and Dehnen profiles with cusp of different slopes
at the time of formation. We determine the corresponding density profile of the
residual gas for a given global SFE, assuming that our model clusters formed
with a constant efficiency per free-fall time and hence have shallower density
profile of gas than that of stars. We perform direct $N$-body simulations of
evolution of clusters initially in virial equilibrium within gas potential
after gas removal. We find that the violent relaxation lasts no longer than
20~Myr independently of the density profile power law slopes. Dehnen model
clusters survive after violent relaxation with significantly lower SFEs when
the global SFE measured within the Jacobi radius or within a half-mass radius.
Dehnen $\gamma=0$ model clusters show similar final bound fraction with the
Plummer model clusters if global SFE is measured within 10 scale radii. The
final bound fraction increases with $\gamma$ values for a given global SFE. We
conclude that Dehnen clusters better resist the consequences of the violent
relaxation followed the instantaneous gas expulsion than the Plummer clusters.
Thus the shallower the outer density slope of the low-SFE clusters, the better
for their survivability after gas expulsion. Among Dehnen clusters we find that
the steeper the inner slope (cusp) the higher the bound mass fraction is
retained after violent relaxation for a given global SFE.

Good
segmentation demands the model to see the big picture and fine details
simultaneously, i.e., to learn image features that incorporate large context
while keep high spatial resolutions. To approach this goal, the most widely
used methods -- U-Net and variants, extract and fuse multi-scale features.
However, the fused features still have small ""effective receptive fields"" with
a focus on local image cues, limiting their performance. In this work, we
propose Segtran, an alternative segmentation framework based on transformers,
which have unlimited ""effective receptive fields"" even at high feature
resolutions. The core of Segtran is a novel Squeeze-and-Expansion transformer:
a squeezed attention block regularizes the self attention of transformers, and
an expansion block learns diversified representations. Additionally, we propose
a new positional encoding scheme for transformers, imposing a continuity
inductive bias for images. Experiments were performed on 2D and 3D medical
image segmentation tasks: optic disc/cup segmentation in fundus images
(REFUGE'20 challenge), polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images, and brain
tumor segmentation in MRI scans (BraTS'19 challenge). Compared with
representative existing methods, Segtran consistently achieved the highest
segmentation accuracy, and exhibited good cross-domain generalization
capabilities. The source code of Segtran is released at

its computational cost is extremely high, and, in many cases, prohibitive.
Fortunately, the MC algorithm is easily parallelizable, which allows its use in
simulations where the computation of a single realization is very costly. This
work presents a methodology for the parallelization of the MC method, in the
context of cloud computing. This strategy is based on the MapReduce paradigm,
and allows an efficient distribution of tasks in the cloud. This methodology is
illustrated on a problem of structural dynamics that is subject to
uncertainties. The results show that the technique is capable of producing good
results concerning statistical moments of low order. It is shown that even a
simple problem may require many realizations for convergence of histograms,
which makes the cloud computing strategy very attractive (due to its high
scalability capacity and low-cost). Additionally, the results regarding the
time of processing and storage space usage allow one to qualify this new
methodology as a solution for simulations that require a number of MC

value problem for the generalized conformal field equations in which a wave
profile for the ingoing wave is specified at an outer time-like boundary which
then hits an initially static and spherically symmetric black hole. The
non-linear interaction of the black hole with the gravitational wave leads to
scattered radiation moving back out. The clean separation between initial state
and incoming radiation makes this setup ideal to study scattering problems. The
use of the conformal field equations allows us to trace the response of the
black hole to null infinity where we can read off the scattered gravitational
waves and compute the Bondi-Sachs mass and the gravitational flux through
$\mathscr{I}$. In this way we check the Bondi-Sachs mass loss formula directly

relation to capability measurement in ASD with a focus on selecting individuals
to agile teams, and capabilities related to team performance and success,
determining to what degree the SLR's results apply to practice can provide
progressive insights to both research and practice.
  Objective: Our study investigates how agile practitioners perceive the
relevance of individual and team level measures for characterizing the
capability of an agile team and its members. Furthermore, to scrutinize
variations in practitioners' perceptions, our study further analyzes
perceptions across stratified demographic groups.
  Method: We undertook a Web-based survey using a questionnaire built based on
the capability measures identified from a previously conducted SLR.
  Results: Our survey responses (60) indicate that 127 individual and 28 team
capability measures were considered as relevant by the majority of

that this jet was ejected over a period of $\sim6$ hours and thus its ejection
was contemporaneous with the QPO transition. Our new technique locates the
original, faster ejection in an observation in which it was previously
undetected. With this detection we revised the fits to the proper motions of
the ejecta and calculated a jet inclination angle of $(64\pm5)^\circ$, and jet
velocities of $0.97_{-0.09}^{+0.03}c$ for the fast-moving ejecta ($\Gamma>2.1$)
and $(0.30\pm0.05)c$ for the newly-identified slow-moving ejection
($\Gamma=1.05\pm0.02$). We show that the approaching slow-moving component is
predominantly responsible for the radio flare, and is likely linked to the
switch from type-C to type-B QPOs, while no definitive signature of ejection
was identified for the fast-moving ejecta.

cluster R$\,$136, 30 Doradus is an ideal target to test the leading theory of
the grain alignment and rotational disruption by RAdiative Torques (RATs).
Here, we use publicly available polarized thermal dust emission observations of
30 Doradus at 89, 154, and 214$\,\mu$m using SOFIA/HAWC+. We analyse the
variation of the dust polarization degree ($p$) with the total emission
intensity ($I$), the dust temperature ($T_{\rm d}$), and the gas column density
($N_{\rm H}$) constructed from ${\it Herschel}$ data. The 30 Doradus complex is
divided into two main regions relative to R$\,$136, namely North and South. In
the North, we find that the polarization degree first decreases and then
increases before decreasing again when the dust temperature increases toward
the irradiating cluster R$\,$136. The first depolarization likely arises from
the decrease of grain alignment efficiency toward the dense medium due to the
attenuation of the interstellar radiation field and the increase of the gas
density. The second trend (the increase of $p$ with $T_{\rm d}$) is consistent
with the RAT alignment theory. The final trend (the decrease of $p$ with
$T_{\rm d}$) is consistent with the RAT alignment theory only when the grain
rotational disruption by RATs is taken into account. In the South, we find that
the polarization degree is nearly independent of the dust temperature, while
the grain alignment efficiency is higher around the peak of the gas column
density and decreases toward the radiation source. The latter feature is also
consistent with the prediction of the rotational disruption by RATs.

Although extensive effort has been directed towards understanding the
equilibrium configurations of BNPs, kinetic mechanisms involved in their
development have not been explored systematically. Since these systems often
contain a miscibility gap, experimental studies have alluded to spinodal
decomposition (SD) as a likely mechanism for the formation of such structures.
We present a novel phase-field model for confined (embedded)systems to study
SD-induced morphological evolution within a BNP. It initiates with the
formation of compositionally modulated rings as a result of surface-directed SD
and eventually develops into core-shell or Janus structures due to
coarsening/breakdown of the rings. The final configuration depends crucially on
contact angle and particle size -Janus is favored at smaller sizes and higher
contact angles. Our simulations also illustrate the formation of metastable,
kinetically trapped structures as a result of competition between capillarity
and diffusion.

blocks at one block height at the same time, implying that various nodes have
different perspectives of the main chain. Natural forking might give rise to
multiple adverse impacts on blockchain, jeopardizing the performance and
security of the system consequently. However, the ongoing literature in
analyzing natural forking is mainly from the macro point of view, which is not
sufficient to incisively understand this phenomenon. In this paper, we fill
this gap through leveraging the large deviation theory to conduct a microscopic
study of natural forking, which resorts to investigating the instantaneous
difference between block generation and dissemination in blockchain. Our work
is derived comprehensively and complementarily via a three-step process, where
both the natural forking probability and its decay rate are presented. Through
solid theoretical derivation and extensive numerical simulations, we find 1)
the probability of the mismatch between block generation and dissemination
exceeding a given threshold dwindles exponentially with the increase of natural
forking robustness related parameter or the difference between the block
dissemination rate and block creation rate; 2) the natural forking robustness
related parameter may emphasize a more dominant effect on accelerating the
abortion of natural forking in some cases; 3) when the self-correlated block
generation rate is depicted as the stationary autoregressive process with a
scaling parameter, it is found that setting a lower scaling parameter may speed
up the failure of natural forking. These findings are valuable since they offer
a fresh theoretical basis to engineer optimal countermeasures for thwarting
natural forking and thereby enlivening the blockchain network.

of 3.5 to 10.0~$\mu$m silica spheres, achieving stiffness up to 27.5$\pm$4.1

  images","11 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Registration networks have shown great application potentials in medical
image analysis. However, supervised training methods have a great demand for
large and high-quality labeled datasets, which is time-consuming and sometimes
impractical due to data sharing issues. Unsupervised image registration
algorithms commonly employ intensity-based similarity measures as loss
functions without any manual annotations. These methods estimate the
parameterized transformations between pairs of moving and fixed images through
the optimization of the network parameters during training. However, these
methods become less effective when the image quality varies, e.g., some images
are corrupted by substantial noise or artifacts. In this work, we propose a
novel approach based on a low-rank representation, i.e., Regnet-LRR, to tackle
the problem. We project noisy images into a noise-free low-rank space, and then
compute the similarity between the images. Based on the low-rank similarity
measure, we train the registration network to predict the dense deformation
fields of noisy image pairs. We highlight that the low-rank projection is
reformulated in a way that the registration network can successfully update
gradients. With two tasks, i.e., cardiac and abdominal intra-modality
registration, we demonstrate that the low-rank representation can boost the
generalization ability and robustness of models as well as bring significant
improvements in noisy data registration scenarios.

  In this paper, we focus on finding small kernels for edge modification

which the goal is to partition the vertex set into a disjoint union of cliques.
Even if this problem admits a $2k$ kernel [Cao, 2012], this kernel does not
reduce the size of most instances. Therefore, we explore the question of
whether linear kernels are a theoretical limit in edge modification problems,
in particular when the target graphs are very structured (such as a partition
into cliques for instance). We prove, as far as we know, the first sublinear
kernel for an edge modification problem. Namely, we show that Clique +
Independent Set Deletion, which is a restriction of Cluster Deletion, admits a
kernel of size $O(k/\log k)$.
  We also obtain small kernels for several other edge modification problems. We
prove that Split Addition (and the equivalent Split Deletion) admits a linear
kernel, improving the existing quadratic kernel of Ghosh et al. [Ghosh et al.,
2015]. We complement this result by proving that Trivially Perfect Addition
admits a quadratic kernel (improving the cubic kernel of Guo [Guo, 2007]), and
finally prove that its triangle-free version (Starforest Deletion) admits a

single user response (a comment or a relevant article) to capture evidence have
shown remarkable success in interpretable claim verification. Owing to
different single responses convey different cognition of individual users
(i.e., audiences), the captured evidence belongs to the perspective of
individual cognition. However, individuals' cognition of social things is not
always able to truly reflect the objective. There may be one-sided or biased
semantics in their opinions on a claim. The captured evidence correspondingly
contains some unobjective and biased evidence fragments, deteriorating task
performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view model based on the views of
Collective and Individual Cognition (CICD) for interpretable claim
verification. From the view of the collective cognition, we not only capture
the word-level semantics based on individual users, but also focus on
sentence-level semantics (i.e., the overall responses) among all users and
adjust the proportion between them to generate global evidence. From the view
of individual cognition, we select the top-$k$ articles with high degree of
difference and interact with the claim to explore the local key evidence
fragments. To weaken the bias of individual cognition-view evidence, we devise
inconsistent loss to suppress the divergence between global and local evidence
for strengthening the consistent shared evidence between the both. Experiments
on three benchmark datasets confirm that CICD achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

thermal properties of virtually any dielectric crystal at low temperatures in

disordered solids. In general, Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) or Molecular
Dynamics (PIMD) methods are powerful tools to determine stochastically
thermodynamic quantities without systematic bias, not relying on perturbative
schemes. Addressing transport properties, for instance calculating thermal
conductivity from PIMC, however, is substantially more difficult. Although
correlation functions of current operators can be determined by PIMC from
analytic continuation on the imaginary-time axis, Bayesian methods are usually
employed for the numerical inversion back to real-time response functions. This
task not only strongly relies on the accuracy of the PIMC data, but also
introduces noticeable dependence on the model used for the inversion. Here, we
address both difficulties with care. In particular, we first devise improved
estimators for current correlations which substantially reduce the variance of
the PIMC data. Next, we provide a neat statistical approach to the inversion
problem, blending into a fresh workflow the classical stochastic maximum
entropy method together with recent notions borrowed from statistical learning
theory. We test our ideas on a single harmonic oscillator and a collection of

Such detectors offer high resolution and high efficiency at reasonable cost for

Standard systems work with a constant gas flow, leading to regular maintenance
in the form of gas cylinder changes, which can be an issue for remote field
applications. In this paper we discuss the practical possibilities to reduce
gas consumption of an outdoor gaseous tracker, where particularly the gas
density change from daily temperature cycling limits the input flow. Such
""breathing"" effect can be circumvented by well designed buffer volume, which
must prevent external air contamination. A realistic MWPC tracking test system
with 0.9 square meter area, total volume of 160 l, has been operated for 36
days with a flow of 3 l/day, confirming that the buffer volume, in this case a
50 m long and 10 l volume low diffusion tube, ensures sufficient gas quality.
The key effects governing the gas flow dynamics, including diffusion and gas
volume change, has been studied quantitatively, leading to practical design
prescriptions.

that decades of studies on generating a single sequence of random numbers on

existing MISRN approaches either suffer from heavy resource consumption or fail

Moreover, ThundeRiNG develops a novel state sharing among a massive number of

show that ThundeRiNG successfully passes the widely used statistical test,
TestU01, only consumes a constant number of DSPs (less than 1\% of the FPGA

bitwise NOT operation is applied to each quantum bit of the binary signal, a
QNN outputs the same logits. That is to say, QNNs cannot differentiate a
quantum binary signal and its negational counterpart in a binary classification
task. We further empirically evaluate the negational symmetry of QNNs in binary
pattern classification tasks using Google's quantum computing framework. The
theoretical and experimental results suggest that negational symmetry is a
fundamental property of QNNs, which is not shared by classical models. Our

seems regular with increasing of the doping concentration (x), an unexpected
chiral CDW phase is observed in the sample with x = 0.08, in which Ti atoms
almost fully occupy the central Ta atoms in the CDW clusters. The emergence of
the chiral CDW is proposed to be from the doping-enhanced orbital order. Only
when x = 0.08, the possible long-range orbital order can trigger the chiral CDW

electronic flat band and the corresponding CDW phase, which is a prerequisite

negligible engineering efforts. To improve the robustness of the network, we
leverage the consistency of the output layer and intermediate layers for

intermediate representation and convolution kernel is also introduced to reduce
the reduce redundant in a neural network. Compared to the method of Song and

test errors on the STL-10 dataset are decreased by $9.28\%$ and $5.45\%$ for
ResNet-18 and VGG-16 respectively. Moreover, our method is proven to be robust

compaction and indexing scenarios, is based on the combination of kernel
density estimation and Lloyd-Max quantization to minimize the information loss

shown to enhance anomaly detection in the lower-dimensional space. Besides, we
verify on a theoretical basis a previously observed phenomenon of the intrinsic

we find that different models make relatively similar predictions on clean
examples which denote the real user preference, while the predictions on noisy
examples vary much more across different models. Motivated by this observation,
we propose denoising with cross-model agreement(DeCA) which aims to minimize
the KL-divergence between the real user preference distributions parameterized
by two recommendation models while maximizing the likelihood of data
observation. We employ the proposed DeCA on four state-of-the-art
recommendation models and conduct experiments on four datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that DeCA significantly improves recommendation performance
compared with normal training and other denoising methods. Codes will be
open-sourced.

version of the gradient of a function. These functionals are often used when
dealing with optimization problems where the computation of the gradient of the
objective function is costly or the objective function values are affected by
some noise. These functionals have been considered to estimate the gradient of
the objective function by the expected value of the function variations in the
space of directions. The expected value is then approximated by a sample
average over a proper (random) choice of sample directions in the domain of
integration. In this way the approximation error is characterized by
statistical properties of the sample average estimate, typically its variance.
This work instead is aimed at deriving a new approximation scheme, where linear
functionals are no longer considered as expected values over the space of
directions, but rather as the filtered derivative of the objective function by
a gaussian kernel. By using this new approach, a gradient estimation based on a
suitable linear combination of central finite differences at different step
sizes is proposed, allowing to characterize the error of approximation in a
deterministic way. Numerical experiments on a set of test functions are
encouraging, showing good performances compared to those of the methods
commonly used in the literature, both in the noisy and in the non-noisy
setting.

overcome this drawback, the current industry practice for manifesting updates

strongly differ at high excitation densities. Remarkably, in this regime the
trion distribution develops a halo shape, similar to that previously observed
in WS2 monolayers at room temperature and under pulsed excitation. In contrast,
the exciton distribution only presents a moderate broadening without the
appereance of a halo. Spatially and spectrally resolved luminescence spectra
reveal the buildup of a significant temperature gradient at high excitation

frequency chirping. Various models have been proposed to understand the
chirping mechanism, which is a long-standing problem in space plasmas. Based on
analysis of effective wave growth rate and electron phase space dynamics in a
self-consistent particle simulation, we propose here a phenomenological model
called the ""Trap-Release-Amplify"" (TaRA) model for chorus. In this model, phase
space structures of correlated electrons are formed by nonlinear wave particle
interactions, which mainly occur in the downstream. When released from the wave
packet in the upstream, these electrons selectively amplify new emissions which
satisfy the phase-locking condition to maximize wave power transfer, leading to
frequency chirping. The phase-locking condition at the release point gives a
frequency chirping rate that is fully consistent with the one by Helliwell in
case of a nonuniform background magnetic field. The nonlinear wave particle
interaction part of the TaRA model results in a chirping rate that is
proportional to wave amplitude, a conclusion originally reached by Vomvoridis
et al. Therefore, the TaRA model unifies two different results from seemingly
unrelated studies. Furthermore, the TaRA model naturally explains fine
structures of chorus waves, including subpackets and bandwidth, and their
evolution through dynamics of phase-trapped electrons. Finally, we suggest that
this model could be applied to explain other related phenomena, including
frequency chirping of chorus in a uniform background magnetic field and of
electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves in the magnetosphere.

of a UIO providing asymptotically converging state estimates, and propose a
purely data-driven algorithm for their computation. Even though we focus on
UIOs, our results also apply to the standard case of completely known inputs.
As an example, we apply the proposed method to distributed state estimation in
DC microgrids and illustrate its potential for cyber-attack detection.

the results of various numerical experiments to show the influence of mobility

modulation and the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology can
make communication systems perform better in high-mobility scenarios, there are
still many challenges in downlink channel estimation owing to inaccurate
modeling and high pilot overhead in practical systems. In this paper, we
propose a channel state information (CSI) acquisition scheme for downlink
massive MIMO-OTFS in presence of the fractional Doppler, including
deterministic pilot design and channel estimation algorithm. First, we analyze
the input-output relationship of the single-input single-output (SISO) OTFS
based on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modem and extend
it to massive MIMO-OTFS. Moreover, we formulate an accurate model for the
practical system in which the fractional Doppler is considered and the
influence of subpaths is revealed. A deterministic pilot design is then
proposed based on the model and the structure of the pilot matrix to reduce
pilot overhead and save memory consumption. Since channel geometry changes very
slowly relative to the communication timescale, we put forward a modified
sensing matrix based channel estimation (MSMCE) algorithm to acquire the
downlink CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed downlink CSI
acquisition scheme has significant advantages over traditional algorithms.

most of the existing methods are based on linear or shallow model, when the
data tensor becomes large and the observation data is very small, it is prone
to over fitting and the performance decreases significantly. To address this
problem, the completion method for a tensor based on a Biased Deep Tensor
Factorization Network (BDTFN) is proposed. This method can not only overcome
the shortcomings of traditional tensor factorization, but also deal with
complex non-linear data. Firstly, the horizontal and lateral tensors
corresponding to the observed values of the input tensors are used as inputs
and projected to obtain their horizontal (lateral) potential feature tensors.
Secondly, the horizontal (lateral) potential feature tensors are respectively
constructed into a multilayer perceptron network. Finally, the horizontal and
lateral output tensors are fused by constructing a bilinear pooling layer.
Tensor forward-propagation is composed of those three step, and its parameters
are updated by tensor back-propagation using the multivariable chain rule. In
this paper, we consider the large-scale 5-minute traffic speed data set and use
it to address the missing data imputation problem for large-scale
spatiotemporal traffic data. In addition, we compare the numerical performance
of the proposed algorithm with those for state-of-the-art approaches on video
recovery and color image recovery. Numerical experimental results illustrate
that our approach is not only much more accurate than those state-of-the-art

implementation. The challenges of accurate code search mainly lie in the
knowledge gap between source code and natural language (i.e., queries). Due to
the limited code-query pairs and large code-description pairs available, the
prior studies based on deep learning techniques focus on learning the semantic
matching relation between source code and corresponding description texts for
the task, and hypothesize that the semantic gap between descriptions and user
queries is marginal. In this work, we found that the code search models trained
on code-description pairs may not perform well on user queries, which indicates
the semantic distance between queries and code descriptions. To mitigate the
semantic distance for more effective code search, we propose QueCos, a
Query-enriched Code search model. QueCos learns to generate semantic enriched
queries to capture the key semantics of given queries with reinforcement
learning (RL). With RL, the code search performance is considered as a reward
for producing accurate semantic enriched queries. The enriched queries are
finally employed for code search. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show
that QueCos can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art code search

improve imaging speed and resolution is to use higher field strengths, which
also has subtle and potentially harmful implications. However, patient safety
is to be considered utterly important at all stages of research and clinical
routine. Here we show that dynamic metamaterials are a promising solution to
expand the potential of MRI and to overcome some limitations. A thin, smart,

increases the signal-to-noise ratio in 3T MRI significantly (up to eightfold),

patient safety is also assured. This self-detuning works without introducing
any additional overhead related to MRI-compatible electronic control components

radiative transfer problems, based on reverse ray tracing combined with
tree-based accelerated integration. We implement TreeRay in the adaptive mesh
refinement code FLASH, as a module of the tree solver developed by W\""unsch et
al. However, the method itself is independent of the host code and can be
implemented in any grid based or particle based hydrodynamics code. A key
advantage of TreeRay is that its computational cost is independent of the
number of sources, making it suitable for simulations with many point sources
(e.g. massive star clusters) as well as simulations where diffuse emission is
important. A very efficient communication and tree-walk strategy enables
TreeRay to achieve almost ideal parallel scalings. TreeRay can easily be
extended with sub-modules to treat radiative transfer at different wavelengths
and to implement related physical processes. Here, we focus on ionising (EUV)
radiation and use the On-the-Spot approximation to test the method and its
parameters. The ability to set the tree solver time step independently enables
the speedy calculation of radiative transfer in a multi-phase interstellar
medium, where the hydrodynamic time step is typically limited by the sound
speed of the hot gas produced in stellar wind bubbles or supernova remnants. We
show that complicated simulations of star clusters with feedback from multiple
massive stars become feasible with TreeRay.

mechanisms which underlie them. Research has advanced according to well-known
psychological findings, such as category and dimension theories. Many studies
have been based on these basic theories, addressing only basic emotions.
However, social emotions, also referred to as higher-level emotions, have been
studied in psychology. We believe that these higher-level emotions are worth
pursuing in robotics for next-generation, socially aware robots. In this review
paper, we summarize the findings on social emotions in psychology and
neuroscience, along with a survey of the studies on social emotions in robotics
that have been conducted to date. Thereafter, research directions toward the
implementation of social emotions in robots are discussed.

study is carried out on the basis of the Hamiltonian for quasi-relativistic
fermions by using a continual approach and tight-binding calculations. We
derive the spectral characteristics and spatial localization of the the
one-dimensional low-energy states appearing at the domain walls. The antiphase
domain walls are shown to generate the topologically protected chiral states
with linear dispersion, the group velocity and spin-polarization direction of
which depend on an easy axis orientation. In the case of an easy plane
anisotropy, we predict a realization of a dispersionless state, flat band in
the energy spectrum, that is spin-polarized along the surface normal.
Modification of the surface states in the multi-domain case, which is
approximated by a periodic set of domain walls, is described as well. We find
that the magnetic domain walls with complex internal texture, such as
N\'eel-like or Bloch-like walls, also host the topological states, although
their spectrum and spin structure can be changed compared with the sharp wall

antiferromagnetism along 100 directions, for which 1/2 111 is not a periodicity

pairwise, leading to dissociated 111 super-dislocations. On the other side, 100

fault are generated when 100 dislocations glide. Dislocation properties are
computed in the magnetically ordered and non magnetic phases of chromium for

the two inputs -- linguistic content and speaker identity -- we add adversarial

increased sensitivity comes in large part from the comparably higher
circulating power we aim to achieve, which reduces the overall shot noise. One
complication of higher circulating power is an increase in contrast defect
light, which includes higher-order modes. We will use the DC-readout scheme,
whose dark-fringe offset must sufficiently dominate the contrast defect in
order to detect faint signals. However, too much total output power risks
saturating the high-bandwidth photodetectors. Suppressing the higher-order mode
content of the contrast defect is a key strategy to realising the high
circulating power and eliminating non-signal-carrying power that contributes to
shot noise. For this, the inclusion of an output mode cleaner, whose design is

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-3881/ac01dd",,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The most challenging limitation in transit photometry arises from the noises
in the photometric signal. In particular, the ground-based telescopes are
heavily affected by the noise due to perturbation in the Earth's atmosphere.
Use of telescopes with large apertures can improve the photometric
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to a great extent. However, detecting a transit
signal out of a noisy light curve of the host star and precisely estimating the
transit parameters call for various noise reduction techniques. Here, we
present multi-band transit photometric follow-up observations of five
hot-Jupiters e.g., HAT-P-30 b, HAT-P-54 b, WASP-43 b, TrES-3 b and XO-2 N b,
using the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) at the Indian Astronomical
Observatory, Hanle and the 1.3m J. C. Bhattacharya Telescope (JCBT) at the
Vainu Bappu Observatory, Kavalur. Our critical noise treatment approach
includes techniques such as Wavelet Denoising and Gaussian Process regression,
which effectively reduce both time-correlated and time-uncorrelated noise
components from our transit light curves. In addition to these techniques, use
of our state-of-the-art model algorithms have allowed us to estimate the
physical properties of the target exoplanets with a better accuracy and
precision compared to the previous studies.

in a wide range of systems, evolve through consecutive phase transitions with
different broken symmetries remains unexplored. Nd2SrFe2O7, a bilayer ferrite,
exhibits two intriguing structural phase transitions and dense networks of the
so-called type-II Z8 structural vortices at room temperature, so it is an ideal
system to explore the topological defect evolution. From our extensive
experimental investigation, we demonstrate that the cooling rate at the
second-order transition (1290oC) plays a decisive role in determining the
vortex density at room temperature, following the universal Kibble-Zurek
mechanism. In addition, we discovered a transformation between
topologically-distinct vortices (Z8 to Z4 vortices) at the first-order
transition (550oC), which conserves the number of vortex cores. Remarkably, the
Z4 vortices consist of two phases with an identical symmetry but two distinct
magnitudes of an order parameter. Furthermore, when lattice distortion is
enhanced by chemical doping, a new type of topological defects emerges: loop
domain walls with orthorhombic distortions in the tetragonal background,
resulting in unique pseudo-orthorhombic twins. Our findings open a new avenue
to explore the evolution of topological defects through multiple phase
transitions.

nonlinear in terms of the distribution law. Hence, the transition kernels are
dependent on the current probability distributions of the process apart from
being dependent on the current state. Such processes often act as limits for
large-scale systems of dependent Markov chains with interaction. The paper
generalizes the convergence results by taking the estimate over two steps. Such
an approach keeps the existence and uniqueness results under assumptions that
are analogical to the one-step result. It is shown that such an approach may
lead to a better rate of convergence. Several examples provided illustrating
the fact that the suggested estimate may have a better rate of convergence than
the original one. Also, it is shown that the new estimate may even be
applicable in some cases when the conditions of the result on one step cannot

works propose sequential search algorithms, e.g., Compressive Sensing (CS),
that are most suited to static channels and consequently cannot apply to highly
dynamic scenarios such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). To address the latter

Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) systems. Our
approach derives the analog precoder/combiner through a MV beam alignment
procedure. For the digital precoder/combiner, we adapt the Low-Rank (LR)
channel estimation method to learn the position-dependent eigenmodes of the
received digital signal (after beamforming), which is used to estimate the
compressed channel in the communication phase. Extensive numerical simulations,
obtained with ray-tracing channel data and realistic vehicle trajectories,
demonstrate the benefits of our solution in terms of both achievable Spectral

Maximum Likelihood (U-ML) estimate of the compressed digital channel, making it
suitable for both 5G and future 6G systems. Most notably, in some scenarios, we
obtain the performance of the optimal Fully Digital (FD) systems.

human to human, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed at reducing the
interactions between humans are usually implemented. One example of the latter
kind of measures is social distancing, which can be either policy-driven or can
arise endogenously in the population as a consequence of the fear of infection.
However, if NPIs are lifted before the population reaches herd immunity,
further re-introductions of the pathogen would lead to secondary infections.
Here we study the effects of different social distancing schemes on the large
scale spreading of diseases. Specifically, we generalize metapopulation models
to include social distancing mechanisms at the subpopulation level and model
short- and long-term strategies that are fed with local or global information
about the epidemics. We show that different model ingredients might lead to
very diverse outcomes in different subpopulations. Our results suggest that
there is not a unique answer to the question of whether contention measures are
more efficient if implemented and managed locally or globally and that model
outcomes depends on how the full complexity of human interactions is taken into
account.

and hence in regulating Earth's climate. Yet statistical analysis of ocean heat
transport suffers from partially incomplete large-scale data intertwined with
complex spatio-temporal dynamics, as well as from potential model
misspecification. We present a comprehensive spatio-temporal statistical
framework tailored to interpolating the global ocean heat transport using
in-situ Argo profiling float measurements. We formalize the statistical
challenges using latent local Gaussian process regression accompanied by a
two-stage fitting procedure. We introduce an approximate
Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly estimate both the mean field and
the covariance parameters, and refine the potentially under-specified mean
field model with a debiasing procedure. This approach provides data-driven
global ocean heat transport fields that vary in both space and time and can
provide insights into crucial dynamical phenomena, such as El Ni{\~n}o \& La
Ni{\~n}a, as well as the global climatological mean heat transport field, which
by itself is of scientific interest. The proposed framework and the Argo-based
estimates are thoroughly validated with state-of-the-art multimission satellite
products and shown to yield realistic subsurface ocean heat transport
estimates.

systems to explicitly acquire user preferences towards items and attributes
through interactive conversations. Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely
adopted to learn conversational recommendation policies to decide what
attributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at
each conversation turn. However, existing methods mainly target at solving one
or two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated
conversation and recommendation components, which restrict the scalability and
generality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In
the light of these challenges, we propose to formulate these three
decision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to
systematically integrate conversation and recommendation components, we develop
a dynamic weighted graph based RL method to learn a policy to select the action
at each conversation turn, either asking an attribute or recommending items.
Further, to deal with the sample efficiency issue, we propose two action
selection strategies for reducing the candidate action space according to the
preference and entropy information. Experimental results on two benchmark CRS
datasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed method
not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also enhances

Most existing methods tend to design skeletal-based graphs to build the

motion's balance property, is usually weakened because it is learned from part
to whole progressively and asynchronously. Thus, the final predicted motions
are sometimes unnatural. To tackle this issue, we learn a medium, called
balance attractor (BA), from the spatiotemporal features of motion to
characterize the global motion features, which is subsequently used to build
new joint relations. Through the BA, all joints are related synchronously, and
thus the global coordination of all joints can be better learned. Based on the
BA, we propose our framework, referred to Attractor-Guided Neural Network,
mainly including Attractor-Based Joint Relation Extractor (AJRE) and
Multi-timescale Dynamics Extractor (MTDE). The AJRE mainly includes Global

continuous environments. The general augmented Lagrangian method suffers the
double-sampling obstacle in solving the LP. Namely, the conditional
expectations originated from the constraint functions and the quadratic
penalties in the augmented Lagrangian function impose difficulties in sampling
and evaluation. Motivated from the updates of the multipliers, we overcome the
obstacles in minimizing the augmented Lagrangian function by replacing the
intractable conditional expectations with the multipliers. Therefore, a deep
parameterized augment Lagrangian method is proposed. Furthermore, the
replacement provides a promising breakthrough to integrate the two steps in the
augmented Lagrangian method into a single constrained problem. A general
theoretical analysis shows that the solutions generated from a sequence of the
constrained optimizations converge to the optimal solution of the LP if the
error is controlled properly. A theoretical analysis on the quadratic penalty
algorithm under neural tangent kernel setting shows the residual can be
arbitrarily small if the parameter in network and optimization algorithm is
chosen suitably. Preliminary experiments illustrate that our method is
competitive to other state-of-the-art algorithms.

effective, simple, reliable, compact, and low cost in order to be adopted by
industry. To address this, we present the design of a 6 MeV high capture
efficiency S-band electron linac that captures 90% of the initial DC beam. This
linac does not require any extra parts that would increase the cost as the high
efficiency is achieved via a low-field-amplitude in the first bunching cell to
decrease the number of backstreaming electrons, to velocity bunch the electron
beam, and recapture backstreaming electrons. Under the low field amplitude, any
electrons launched at decelerating phases travel backward with low speeds, thus
most of them can catch the next RF cycle, and get re-accelerated/recaptured. As
the electron speed is low, the cell length is also shorter than existing
linacs. Such a short field is achieved by the use of asymmetric cells with
differential coupling to the side-coupled cells. Our novel design has
implications for all commercial high current thermionic gun linacs for
increasing beam current and increasing cathode lifetime.

These trade-offs constrain the technical and economic potentials for these

techno-economic and geospatial analyses with crowd-sourced scenicness data to
quantify landscape aesthetics. Despite strong correlations between scenicness
and planning application outcomes for onshore wind, no such relationship exists
for ground-mounted PV. The innovative method for rooftop-PV assessment combines
bottom-up analysis of four cities with a top-down approach at the national

(including, e.g., quintessence) one naturally expects the scalar field to
couple to the rest of the model's degrees of freedom. In particular, a coupling
to the electromagnetic sector leads to a time (redshift) dependence of the
fine-structure constant and a violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. Here
we extend the previous Euclid forecast constraints on dark energy models to
this enlarged (but physically more realistic) parameter space, and forecast how
well Euclid, together with high-resolution spectroscopic data and local
experiments, can constrain these models. Our analysis combines simulated Euclid
data products with astrophysical measurements of the fine-structure constant,
$\alpha$, and local experimental constraints, and includes both parametric and
non-parametric methods. For the astrophysical measurements of $\alpha$ we
consider both the currently available data and a simulated dataset
representative of Extremely Large Telescope measurements and expected to be
available in the 2030s. Our parametric analysis shows that in the latter case
the inclusion of astrophysical and local data improves the Euclid dark energy
figure of merit by between $8\%$ and $26\%$, depending on the correct fiducial
model, with the improvements being larger in the null case where the fiducial
coupling to the electromagnetic sector is vanishing. These improvements would
be smaller with the current astrophysical data. Moreover, we illustrate how a
genetic algorithms based reconstruction provides a null test for the presence
of the coupling. Our results highlight the importance of complementing surveys
like Euclid with external data products, in order to accurately test the wider
parameter spaces of physically motivated paradigms.

assumed to follow classical field equations due to their high degeneracy in the
phase space. In this work, we explore the disparity between classical and
quantum field treatments in the context of density and velocity fields of
axions. Once the initial density and velocity field are specified, the
evolution of the axion fluid is unique in the classical field treatment.
However, in the quantum field treatment, there are many quantum states
consistent with the given initial density and velocity field. We show that
evolutions of the density perturbations for these quantum states are not
necessarily identical and, in general, differ from the unique classical
evolution. To illustrate the underlying physics, we consider a system of large
number of bosons in a one-dimensional box, moving under the gravitational
potential of a heavy static point-mass. We ignore the self-interactions between
the bosons here. Starting with homogeneous number density and zero velocity
field, we determine the density perturbations in the linear regime in both
quantum and classical field theories. We find that classical and quantum
evolutions are identical in the linear regime if only one single-particle state
is occupied by all the bosons and the self-interaction is absent. If more than
one single-particle states are occupied, the density perturbations in quantum
evolutions differ from the classical prediction after a certain time which
depends upon the parameters of the system.

world that every dynamic vision system is faced with. However, it is implicit
and intractable which has never been quantitatively described due to the
difficulty in defending temporal features correlated to spatial image
complexity. To fill this vacancy, we propose a novel bio-robotic approach to
profile visual dynamic complexity which can be used as a new metric. Here we
apply a state-of-the-art brain-inspired motion detection neural network model
to explicitly profile such complexity associated with spatial-temporal
frequency (SF-TF) of visual scene. This model is for the first time implemented
in an autonomous micro-mobile robot which navigates freely in an arena with
visual walls displaying moving sine-wave grating or cluttered natural scene.
The neural dynamic response can make reasonable prediction on surrounding
complexity since it can be mapped monotonically to varying SF-TF of visual
scene. The experiments show this approach is flexible to different visual
scenes for profiling the dynamic complexity. We also use this metric as a
predictor to investigate the boundary of another collision detection visual
system performing in changing environment with increasing dynamic complexity.
This research demonstrates a new paradigm of using biologically plausible
visual processing scheme to estimate dynamic complexity of visual scene from
both spatial and temporal perspectives, which could be beneficial to predicting
input complexity when evaluating dynamic vision systems.

centered on a smooth function approximation for the current-reference limiter,

singular perturbation to systematically eliminate the fast states.
Computational benefits and accuracy of the reduced-order models are benchmarked

constrained bandwidth model is introduced. This transformer can be applied to a
wide class of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, converting a given
fault free synchronous algorithm that satisfies certain conditions into a
self-stabilizing synchronous algorithm for the same problem. The resulting
self-stabilizing algorithms are anonymous, size-uniform, and \emph{fully
adaptive} in the sense that their time complexity is bounded as a function of
the number $k$ of nodes that suffered faults (possibly at different times)
since the last legal configuration. Specifically, for graphs whose degrees are
up-bounded by $\Delta$, the algorithms produced by the transformer stabilize in
time proportional to $\log (k + \Delta)$ in expectation, independently of the
number of nodes in the graph. As such, the transformer is applicable also for
infinite graphs (with degree bound $\Delta$). Another appealing feature of the
transformer is its small message size overhead. The transformer is applied to
known algorithms (or simple variants thereof) for some classic LCL problems,
producing the first anonymous size-uniform self-stabilizing algorithms for
these problems that are provably fully adaptive. From a technical point of
view, the transformer's key design feature is a novel probabilistic tool that
allows different nodes to act in synchrony even though their clocks may have
been adversarially manipulated.

thought to control star formation are very similar. However, M83's nuclear star
formation rate (SFR), as estimated by synchrotron and H-alpha emission, is an
order of magnitude higher than the Milky Way's. To understand the origin of
this difference we use ALMA observations of HCN (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0) to trace
the dense gas at the size scale of individual molecular clouds (0.54"", 12pc) in
the inner ~500 pc of M83, and compare this to gas clouds at similar resolution
and galactocentric radius in the Milky Way. We find that both the overall gas
distribution and the properties of individual clouds are very similar in the
two galaxies, and that a common mechanism may be responsible for instigating
star formation in both circumnuclear rings. Given the considerable similarity
in gas properties, the most likely explanation for the order of magnitude
difference in SFR is time variability, with the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ)
currently being at a more quiescent phase of its star formation cycle. We show
M83's SFR must have been an order of magnitude higher 5-7 Myr ago. M83's
`starburst' phase was highly localised, both spatially and temporally, greatly
increasing the feedback efficiency and ability to drive galactic-scale
outflows. This highly dynamic nature of star formation and feedback cycles in
galaxy centres means (i) modeling and interpreting observations must avoid
averaging over large spatial areas or timescales, and (ii) understanding the
multi-scale processes controlling these cycles requires comparing snapshots of
a statistical sample of galaxies in different evolutionary stages.

from two hybrid human-agent setups suggest that the group composition affects

interest are: at high red-shifts, Population III stars that form in isolation,

Unfortunately, if the input to these predicates is an intermediate construction
of an algorithm, its floating point representation may be affected by an
approximation error, and correctness is no longer guaranteed. This paper
introduces the concept of indirect geometric predicate: instead of taking the
intermediate construction as an explicit input, an indirect predicate considers
the primitive geometric elements which are combined to produce such a
construction. This makes it possible to keep track of the floating point
approximation, and thus to exploit efficient filters and expansion arithmetic
to exactly resolve the predicate with minimal overhead with respect to a naive
floating point implementation. As a representative example, we show how to
extend standard predicates to the case of points of intersection of linear
elements (i.e. lines and planes) and show that, on classical problems, this
approach outperforms state-of-the-art solutions based on lazy exact
intermediate representations.

exoplanets by high contrast imaging in the near/mid-infrared, which is the
optimal wavelength domain for studying old, cold planets. In this work, we
present deep AO imaging observations of the nearby Sun-like star $\epsilon$ Ind
A with NaCo ($L^{\prime}$) and NEAR (10-12.5 microns) instruments at VLT, in an
attempt to directly detect its planetary companion whose presence has been
indicated from radial velocity (RV) and astrometric trends. We derive
brightness limits from the non-detection of the companion with both
instruments, and interpret the corresponding sensitivity in mass based on both
cloudy and cloud-free atmospheric and evolutionary models. For an assumed age
of 5 Gyr for the system, we get detectable mass limits as low as 4.4 $M_{\rm
J}$ in NaCo $L^{\prime}$ and 8.2 $M_{\rm J}$ in NEAR bands at 1.5$\arcsec$ from
the central star. If the age assumed is 1 Gyr, we reach even lower mass limits
of 1.7 $M_{\rm J}$ in NaCo $L^{\prime}$ and 3.5 $M_{\rm J}$ in NEAR bands, at
the same separation. However, based on the dynamical mass estimate (3.25
$M_{\rm J}$) and ephemerides from astrometry and RV, we find that the
non-detection of the planet in these observations puts a constraint of 2 Gyr on
the lower age limit of the system. NaCo offers the highest sensitivity to the
planetary companion in these observations, but the combination with the NEAR
wavelength range adds a considerable degree of robustness against uncertainties
in the atmospheric models. This underlines the benefits of including a broad
set of wavelengths for detection and characterisation of exoplanets in direct
imaging studies.

Estimation of losses is necessary to understand the depth of the problem and
design preventive measures. How much is the economic loss due to MF? What will
be the efficiency gain if MF is prevented at the advent of a technology? We
answer these questions using survey data and official statistics employing
economic surplus model. MF incidence in sample buffaloes and cows was 19% and
28%, respectively. Total economic losses were calculated as a sum total of
losses from milk production, mortality of animals and treatment costs. Yearly
economic loss due to MF was estimated to be INR 1000 crores (US$ 137 million)
in Haryana. Value of milk lost had the highest share in total economic losses
(58%), followed by losses due to mortality (29%) and treatment costs (13%).
Despite lower MF incidence, losses were higher in buffaloes due to higher milk
prices and market value of animals. The efficiency gain accruing to producers
if MF is prevented, resulting from increased milk production at decreased costs
was estimated at INR 10990 crores (US$ 1.5 billion). As the potential gain if
prevented is around 10 times the economic losses, this study calls for the use
of preventive technology against MF.

whole frame, thus they measure gross whole body movements rather than specific
joint/limb motion.
  Addressing these challenges, we develop and validate a new method for fidgety

short clips. Human poses capture only relevant motion profiles of joints and
limbs and are thus free from irrelevant appearance artifacts. The dynamics and
coordination between joints are modeled using spatio-temporal graph

information about fidgety movements are selected through a spatio-temporal
attention mechanism. We validate the proposed model on the cerebral palsy

hyperbolicity ratio $\lambda$ of the saddle plays an important role, we
consider it as an independent parameter, so that $\hat\mu=(\lambda,\mu)\in \hat
W=(0,+\infty)\times W$, where $W$ is an open subset of $\mathbb R^N.$ For each
$\hat\mu_0\in\hat W$ and $L>0$, the functions $D(s;\hat\mu)$ and $T(s;\hat\mu)$
have an asymptotic expansion at $s=0$ and $\hat\mu\approx\hat\mu_0$ with the
remainder being uniformly $L$-flat with respect to the parameters. The
principal part of both asymptotic expansions is given in a monomial scale
containing a deformation of the logarithm, the so-called Ecalle-Roussarie
compensator. In this paper we are interested in the coefficients of these
monomials, which are functions depending on $\hat\mu$ that can be shown to be
$\mathscr C^\infty$ in their respective domains and ""universally"" defined,
meaning that their existence is stablished before fixing the flatness $L$ and

is of the form $((0,+\infty)\setminus D)\times W$, where~$D$ a discrete set of
rational numbers at which a resonance of the hyperbolicity ratio $\lambda$
occurs. In our main result we give the explicit expression of some of these
coefficients and to this end a fundamental tool is the employment of a sort of

utilize ML experts to assess the sensibility of explanations, and (b) recruit
non-experts in two user remote caregiver monitoring scenarios, synchronous and

specific model. Assuming analyticity of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, and a
generic low redshift modification to flat $\Lambda$CDM, we find that low

rules out late Universe modifications within FLRW. We show that early Universe
physics that alters the sound horizon can yield an upper limit of $H_0 \sim 71

patterns in driven Bose-Einstein condensates. Two-dimensional star-shaped
patterns with $l$-fold symmetry, ranging from quadrupole ($l=2$) to heptagon
modes ($l=7$), are parametrically excited by modulating the scattering length
near the Feshbach resonance. An effective Mathieu equation and Floquet analysis
are utilized, relating the instability conditions to the dispersion of the
surface modes in a trapped superfluid. Identifying the resonant frequencies of
the patterns, we precisely measure the dispersion relation of the collective
excitations. The oscillation amplitude of the surface excitations increases
exponentially during the modulation. We find that only the $l=6$ mode is
unstable due to its emergent coupling with the dipole motion of the cloud. Our
experimental results are in excellent agreement with the mean-field framework.
Our work opens a new pathway for generating higher-lying collective excitations
with applications, such as the probing of exotic properties of quantum fluids
and providing a generation mechanism of quantum turbulence.

are the preferred instruments for characterizing periodic multilayer stacks
from common vacuum deposition techniques, but the detection mechanism requires
the injected sound wave to maintain coherence during propagation. Beyond
acoustic Bragg mirrors, frequency-domain studies using a tandem Fabry-Perot
interferometer (TFPI) find dispersions of two- and three-dimensional phononic
crystals (PnCs) even for highly disordered samples, but with the caveat that
PnCs must be transparent. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid technique for
overcoming the limitations that time- and frequency-domain approaches exhibit
separately: We inject coherent phonons into a non-transparent PnC using a
pulsed laser and acquire the acoustic transmission spectrum on a TFPI, where
pumped appear alongside spontaneously excited (i.e. incoherent) phonons.
Choosing a metallic Bragg mirror for illustration, we determine the bandgap and
compare with conventional time-domain spectroscopy, finding resolution of the
hybrid approach to match that of a state-of-the-art asynchronous optical
sampling setup. Thus, the hybrid pump-probe technique retains key performance
features of the established one and going forward will likely be preferred for

e.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then
aggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major
drawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating
every passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high
inference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with
longer documents requiring more time and computation. To address this
challenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages
of a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before
running a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We
found it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge
distillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This
pruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose
size does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC
Deep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document
Cascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by
providing essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based

problematic content on YouTube and the role of the recommendation algorithm in
the dissemination of such content. Following a data-driven quantitative

risks of YouTube media consumption by young children; 2) the role of the

focusing on the Involuntary Celibates (Incels) community; and 3) user exposure
to pseudoscientific content on various parts of the platform and how this
exposure changes based on the user's watch history. Our analysis reveals that
young children are likely to encounter disturbing content when they randomly
browse the platform. By analyzing the Incel community on YouTube, we find that
Incel activity is increasing over time and that platforms may play an active
role in steering users towards extreme content. Finally, when studying
pseudoscientific misinformation, we find that YouTube suggests more
pseudoscientific content regarding traditional pseudoscientific topics (e.g.,
flat earth) than for emerging ones (like COVID-19) and that these
recommendations are more common on the search results page than on a user's

variations using two epochs, namely 2017 and 2019. We find GCIRS 7 to be
moderately resolved with a uniform-disk photospheric diameter of
$\theta^*_\text{UD}=1.55 \pm 0.03$ mas ($R^*_\text{UD}=1368 \pm 26$ $R_\odot$)
in the K-band continuum. The narrow-band uniform-disk diameter increases above
2.3 $\mu$m, with a clear correlation with the CO band heads in the spectrum.
This correlation is aptly modeled by a hot ($T_\text{L}=2368\pm37$ K),
geometrically thin molecular shell with a diameter of
$\theta_\text{L}=1.74\pm0.03$ mas, as measured in 2017. The shell diameter
increased ($\theta_\text{L}=1.89\pm0.03$ mas), while its temperature decreased
($T_\text{L}=2140\pm42$ K) in 2019. In contrast, the photospheric diameter
$\theta^*_\text{UD}$ and the extinction up to the photosphere of GCIRS 7
($A_{\mathrm{K}_\mathrm{S}}=3.18 \pm 0.16$) have the same value within
uncertainties at the two epochs. In the context of previous interferometric and
photo-spectrometric measurements, the GRAVITY data allow for an interpretation
in terms of photospheric pulsations. The photospheric diameter measured in 2017
and 2019 is significantly larger than previously reported using the PIONIER
instrument ($\theta_*=1.076 \pm 0.093$ mas in 2013 in the H band). The
parameters of the photosphere and molecular shell of GCIRS 7 are comparable to
those of other red supergiants that have previously been studied using
interferometry.

hypothesis testing for two and multiple hypotheses. It starts with an
introduction to the subject, highlighting its connection to other areas of
robust statistics and giving a brief recount of the most prominent
developments. Subsequently, the minimax principle is introduced and its
strengths and limitations are discussed. The first part of the paper focuses on
the two-hypothesis case. After briefly reviewing the basics of statistical
hypothesis testing, uncertainty sets are introduced as a generic way of
modeling distributional uncertainty. The design of minimax detectors is then
shown to reduce to the problem of determining a pair of least favorable
distributions, and different criteria for their characterization are discussed.
Explicit expressions are given for least favorable distributions under three
types of uncertainty: $\varepsilon$-contamination, probability density bands,
and $f$-divergence balls. Using examples, it is shown how the properties of
these least favorable distributions translate to properties of the
corresponding minimax detectors. The second part of the paper deals with the
problem of robustly testing multiple hypotheses, starting with a discussion of
why this is fundamentally different from the binary problem. Sequential
detection is then introduced as a technique that enables the design of strictly
minimax optimal tests in the multi-hypothesis case. Finally, the usefulness of
robust detectors in practice is showcased using the example of ground
penetrating radar. The paper concludes with an outlook on robust detection
beyond the minimax principle and a brief summary of the presented material.

community, they suffer from several challenges including over-smoothing,
over-squashing, and gradient vanishing. Recently, a series of models have
attempted to relieve these issues by first augmenting the node features and
then imposing node-wise functions based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which
are widely referred to as GA-MLP models. However, while GA-MLP models enjoy
deeper architectures for better accuracy, their efficiency largely
deteriorates. Moreover, popular acceleration techniques such as
stochastic-version or data-parallelism cannot be effectively applied due to the
dependency among samples (i.e., nodes) in graphs. To address these issues, in
this paper, instead of data parallelism, we propose a parallel graph deep
learning Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (pdADMM-G) framework to
achieve model parallelism: parameters in each layer of GA-MLP models can be
updated in parallel. The extended pdADMM-G-Q algorithm reduces communication
costs by introducing the quantization technique. Theoretical convergence to a
(quantized) stationary point of the pdADMM-G algorithm and the pdADMM-G-Q
algorithm is provided with a sublinear convergence rate $o(1/k)$, where $k$ is
the number of iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the convergence of
two proposed algorithms. Moreover, they lead to a more massive speedup and
better performance than all state-of-the-art comparison methods on nine
benchmark datasets. Last but not least, the proposed pdADMM-G-Q algorithm
reduces communication overheads by up to $45\%$ without loss of performance.

calculate the field emission current. For smooth parabolic emitting tips where
space charge is negligible, variation of the electric field at the surface is
known to follow the generalized cosine law. Here we investigate the validity of
the cosine law in the regime where space charge due to emitted electrons is
important. Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with an emission algorithm based
on the cosine law is employed for this study. It is shown that if $E_P$ and
$E_L$ be the field at the apex of tip with and without space charge
respectively, then for $\vartheta=E_P/E_L \geq 0.9$, the average relative
deviation of the electric field from the cosine law is less than $3\%$ over the
endcap. Thus, an emission scheme based on cosine law may be used in PIC
simulations of field emission of electrons from curved emitter tips in the weak
space charge regime. The relation between $\vartheta$ and normalized current
$\zeta$ for curved emitters in this regime is also investigated. A linear
relation, $\vartheta=1 - \delta \zeta$ (where $\delta$ is a constant), similar

value of $\delta$ indicates that the extension of the theory for curved

analyze nuclear reactions at high energies ($E>100$ MeV/nucleon), including
knockout reactions. However, so far, the effective interactions used in this
method are assumed to be fully local.
  Purpose: Given the recent studies on non-local optical potentials, in this
work we assess whether non-locality in the optical potentials is expected to
impact reactions at high energies and then explore different avenues for
extending the eikonal method to include non-local interactions.
  Method: We compare angular distributions obtained for non-local interactions
(using the exact R-matrix approach for elastic scattering and the adiabatic
distorted wave approximation for transfer) with those obtained using their
local-equivalent interactions.
  Results: Our results show that transfer observables are significantly
impacted by non-locality in the high-energy regime. Because knockout reactions
are dominated by stripping (transfer to inelastic channels), non-locality is
expected to have a large effect on knockout observables too. Three approaches
are explored for extending the eikonal method to non-local interactions,
including an iterative method and a perturbation theory.
  Conclusions: None of the derived extensions of the eikonal model provide a
good description of elastic scattering. This work suggests that non-locality
removes the formal simplicity associated with the eikonal model.

origins of Galactic cosmic-rays. We summarize the neutrino measurements by
IceCube and ANTARES in the vicinity of LHAASO sources to constrain the
contribution of hadronic gamma-rays in these sources. We find that the current
observations constrain that the hadronic gamma-rays contribute no more than
~60% of the gamma-rays from Crab Nebula. Gamma-rays from two LHAASO sources,
LHAASO J1825-1326 and LHAASO J1907+0626, are dominated by leptonic components
up to ~200 TeV, under the hypotheses in the analysis by IceCube. The
uncertainties of the constraint on the hadronic gamma-ray emission are
discussed. We also constrain the total 100 TeV gamma-ray emission from TeV PWNe
relying on the remarkable sensitivity of LHAASO at that energies.

social network. In such scenarios there might be a manipulative agent that
would like to manipulate his connections in the social network in order to
increase his utility. We study a model of coalition formation in which a
central organizer, who needs to form $k$ coalitions, obtains information about
the social network from the agents. The central organizer has her own
objective: she might want to maximize the utilitarian social welfare, maximize
the egalitarian social welfare, or simply guarantee that every agent will have
at least one connection within her coalition. In this paper we study the
susceptibility to manipulation of these objectives, given the abilities and
information that the manipulator has. Specifically, we show that if the
manipulator has very limited information, namely he is only familiar with his
immediate neighbours in the network, then a manipulation is almost always
impossible. Moreover, if the manipulator is only able to add connections to the
social network, then a manipulation is still impossible for some objectives,
even if the manipulator has full information on the structure of the network.
On the other hand, if the manipulator is able to hide some of his connections,
then all objectives are susceptible to manipulation, even if the manipulator
has limited information, i.e., when he is familiar with his immediate
neighbours and with their neighbours.

that in the two-dimensional embedding case the attractor is organized by
one-dimensional unstable manifolds of short periodic orbits. In that case, the
dynamics can be approximated by a map on a tree which can in turn be reduced to
a trimodal map of the unit interval. In order to test the limits of the

accumulation of infectious aerosols in the indoor air is unlikely to contribute
significantly to the risk of infection as long as the occupancy of the store is
not too high. Under these conditions, well-fitting face masks are an excellent
means of preventing disease transmission by human aerosols.

over 70 biotech firms located in the Boston biotech cluster were polled and
communication information about interaction with peers, universities and big
pharmaceutical companies was collected, as well as their geolocation tags.
  Findings: Location influences the amount of communication between firms, but
not their innovation success. Rather, what matters is communication intensity
and recollection by others. In particular, there is evidence that rotating
leadership - changing between a more active and passive communication style -
is a predictor of innovative performance.
  Practical implications: Expensive real-estate investments can be replaced by
maintaining social ties. A more dynamic communication style and more diverse
social ties are beneficial to innovation.
  Originality-value: Compared to earlier work that has shown a connection
between location, network and firm performance, this paper offers a more
differentiated view; including a novel measure of communication style, using a
unique data set and providing new insights for firms who want to shape their
communication patterns to improve innovation, independently of their location.

  Characteristics",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many people consider news articles to be a reliable source of information on
current events. However, due to the range of factors influencing news agencies,
such coverage may not always be impartial. Media bias, or slanted news
coverage, can have a substantial impact on public perception of events, and,
accordingly, can potentially alter the beliefs and views of the public. The
main data gap in current research on media bias detection is a robust,
representative, and diverse dataset containing annotations of biased words and
sentences. In particular, existing datasets do not control for the individual
background of annotators, which may affect their assessment and, thus,
represents critical information for contextualizing their annotations. In this
poster, we present a matrix-based methodology to crowdsource such data using a
self-developed annotation platform. We also present MBIC (Media Bias Including
Characteristics) - the first sample of 1,700 statements representing various
media bias instances. The statements were reviewed by ten annotators each and
contain labels for media bias identification both on the word and sentence
level. MBIC is the first available dataset about media bias reporting detailed
information on annotator characteristics and their individual background. The
current dataset already significantly extends existing data in this domain
providing unique and more reliable insights into the perception of bias. In
future, we will further extend it both with respect to the number of articles
and annotators per article.

approximate numerical methods for the Richards equation remains computationally
challenging and requires the development of efficient numerical techniques.
This difficulty is mainly due to the nonlinearity of the unsaturated hydraulic
conductivity and the capillary pressure function. In this study, we develop a
new method based on the localized radial basis function (RBF) and the Kirchhoff
transformation technique in order to solve Richards equation in one and
two-dimensional homogeneous medium. Our approach using the multiquadric radial
basis function allows us to reduce the computational time and provide accurate
numerical solutions. The proposed method does not require mesh generation.
Picard's iterations are used to linearize the resulting nonlinear problem
obtained using the Kirchhoff transformation technique. The numerical
simulations show the capability of the proposed numerical techniques in
predicting the dynamics of water through unsaturated soils.

  the proof is not obvious",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Almost 25 years ago, Jarzynski published a paper in which it was asserted:
the work done, W, in driving a system from state A to state B, characterized by
the Helmholtz free energies FA and FB, satisfies an equality in which an
average over an ensemble of measurements for W determines the difference in
Free energy. Several features of this result require more detailed description,
to be given in the text. The equality is significant and unexpected. So is the
statement that the equality is independent of the rate of change from state A
to state B. A few years ago, I had presented three papers in which the
contraction of the description from full phase space to coordinate space only
was made. This was motivated by the large difference in time scales for momenta
relaxation and coordinate relaxation. The Jarzynski equality (JE) will be shown
here to be correct only in the limit of extremely slow processes. The proposed
counterexample is for a macromolecular harmonic oscillator with a Hooke's
spring constant, k, that during the time interval linearly changes from k1 to
k2. When performed very slowly, we obtain JE in a form in which the free energy
is related to the ratio of the k's. However, when the transition is performed
more rapidly the equality is lost. Jarzynski has suggested to me that Hummer
and Szabo have shown that JE follows directly from the Feynman-Kac formula. We
show here that F-K does not reproduce the direct calculation executed in this
paper and that it has been misapplied in earlier papers.

learning based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model. Given any a known
periodic orbit as a starting point, this approach can provide more and more
periodic orbits (of the same family name) with variable masses, while the mass
domain having periodic orbits becomes larger and larger, and the ANN model
becomes wiser and wiser. Finally we have an ANN model trained by means of all
obtained periodic orbits of the same family, which provides a convenient way to
give accurate enough predictions of periodic orbits with arbitrary masses for
