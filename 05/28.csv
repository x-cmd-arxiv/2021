  Resource for English)","ACL-IJCNLP 2021 camera-ready",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Most words are ambiguous--i.e., they convey distinct meanings in different
contexts--and even the meanings of unambiguous words are context-dependent.
Both phenomena present a challenge for NLP. Recently, the advent of
contextualized word embeddings has led to success on tasks involving lexical
ambiguity, such as Word Sense Disambiguation. However, there are few tasks that
directly evaluate how well these contextualized embeddings accommodate the more
continuous, dynamic nature of word meaning--particularly in a way that matches
human intuitions. We introduce RAW-C, a dataset of graded, human relatedness
judgments for 112 ambiguous words in context (with 672 sentence pairs total),
as well as human estimates of sense dominance. The average inter-annotator
agreement (assessed using a leave-one-annotator-out method) was 0.79. We then
show that a measure of cosine distance, computed using contextualized
embeddings from BERT and ELMo, correlates with human judgments, but that cosine
distance also systematically underestimates how similar humans find uses of the
same sense of a word to be, and systematically overestimates how similar humans
find uses of different-sense homonyms. Finally, we propose a synthesis between
psycholinguistic theories of the mental lexicon and computational models of
lexical semantics.

in planetary atmospheres, while interior models of observed extrasolar giant
planets additionally suggest high heavy element contents. Furthermore, recent
observations of protoplanetary disks revealed super-solar C/H ratios, which are
explained by inward drifting and evaporating pebbles, enhancing the volatile
content of the disk. We investigate how the inward drift and evaporation of
volatile rich pebbles influences the atmospheric C/O ratio and heavy element
content of giant planets growing by pebble and gas accretion. To achieve this
goal, we perform semi analytical 1D models of protoplanetary disks including
the treatment of viscous evolution and heating, pebble drift and simple
chemistry to simulate the growth of planets from planetary embryos to Jupiter
mass objects by accretion of pebbles and gas while they migrate through the
disk. Our simulations show that the composition of the planetary gas atmosphere
is dominated by the accretion of vapour, originating from inward drifting
evaporating pebbles. This process allows the giant planets to harbour large
heavy element contents. In addition, our model reveals that giant planets
originating further away from the central star have a higher C/O ratio on
average due to the evaporation of methane rich pebbles in the outer disk. These
planets can then also harbour super-solar C/O ratios, in line with exoplanet
observations. However, planets formed in the outer disk harbour a smaller heavy
element content, due to a smaller vapour enrichment of the outer disk. Our
model predicts that giant planets with low/large atmospheric C/O should harbour
a large/low total heavy element content. We further conclude that the inclusion
of pebble evaporation at evaporation lines is a key ingredient to determine the
heavy element content and composition of giant planets.

(1) $\rho \rightarrow (-1)^m \rho $ under a generalized mirror map in $d=2m+1$

$\rho$ appears naturally in compactifications of M-theory. For example, the

$\chi(X^4)\rho(Y^7)=\rho(X^4 \times Y^7) $ and hence vanishes when $Y^7$ is

bridge the gap between novel and existing methods, we propose a modular
framework for fleet rebalancing based on model-free reinforcement learning (RL)
that can leverage an existing dispatch method to minimize system cost. In
particular, by treating dispatch as part of the environment dynamics, a
centralized agent can learn to intermittently direct the dispatcher to
reposition free vehicles and mitigate against fleet imbalance. We formulate RL
state and action spaces as distributions over a grid partitioning of the
operating area, making the framework scalable and avoiding the complexities
associated with multiagent RL. Numerical experiments, using real-world trip and
network data, demonstrate that this approach has several distinct advantages
over baseline methods including: improved system cost; high degree of
adaptability to the selected dispatch method; and the ability to perform
scale-invariant transfer learning between problem instances with similar
vehicle and request distributions.

general not smooth enough, the convergence behavior of the optimal controls are
studied for a sequence of (smooth) approximations of the former quasilinear
term. In addition the simultaneous limit in the approximation and the time step
size is considered. For a class covering a large variety of anisotropies we
introduce a certain regularization and show the previously formulated
requirements. Finally, a trust region Newton solver is applied to various
anisotropies and configurations, and numerical evidence for mesh independent
behavior and convergence with respect to regularization is presented.

(TOA) is reduced in the Moon shadow. The solar irradiance is commonly measured
by Earth observation satellites before the start of the solar eclipse and is
not corrected for this reduction, which results in a decrease of the computed
TOA reflectances. Consequently, air quality products that are derived from TOA
reflectance spectra, such as the ultraviolet (UV) Absorbing Aerosol Index
(AAI), are distorted or undefined in the shadow of the Moon. The availability
of air quality satellite data in the penumbral and antumbral shadow during
solar eclipses, however, is of particular interest to users studying the
atmospheric response to solar eclipses. Given the time and location of a point
on the Earth's surface, we explain how to compute the obscuration during a
solar eclipse taking into account wavelength-dependent solar limb darkening.
With the calculated obscuration fractions, we restore the TOA reflectances and
the AAI in the penumbral shadow during the annular solar eclipses on 26
December 2019 and 21 June 2020 measured by the TROPOMI/S5P instrument. In the
corrected products, the signature of the Moon shadow disappeared, but only if
wavelength-dependent solar limb darkening is taken into account. We conclude
that the correction method of this paper can be used to detect real AAI rising
phenomena during a solar eclipse and has the potential to restore any other
product that is derived from TOA reflectance spectra. This would resolve the
solar eclipse anomalies in satellite air quality measurements and would allow
for studying the effect of the eclipse obscuration on the composition of the
Earth's atmosphere from space.

whether they come from similar or distinct progenitors, has been actively
discussed for decades. Here we report spectropolarimetry of two fast declining
Type II (Type IIL) SNe: SN 2013ej and SN 2017ahn. SN 2013ej exhibited high
continuum polarization from very soon after the explosion to the radioactive
tail phase with time-variable polarization angles. The origin of this
polarimetric behavior can be interpreted as the combination of two different
aspherical structures, namely an aspherical interaction of the SN ejecta with
circumstellar matter (CSM) and an inherently aspherical explosion. Aspherical
explosions are a common feature of slowly declining Type II (Type IIP) SNe. By
contrast, SN 2017ahn showed low polarization not only in the photospheric phase
but also in the radioactive tail phase. This low polarization in the tail
phase, which has never before been observed in other Type IIP/L SNe, suggests
that the explosion of SN 2017ahn was nearly spherical. These observations imply
that Type IIL SNe have, at least, two different origins: they result from stars
that have different explosion properties and/or different mass-loss processes.
This fact might indicate that 13ej-like Type IIL SNe originate from a similar
progenitor to those of Type IIP SNe accompanied by an aspherical CSM
interaction, while 17ahn-like Type IIL SNe come from a more massive progenitor
with less hydrogen in its envelope.

bounds of $\mathbf{Q}$. This ensures a physically valid order parameter
$\mathbf{Q}$ (i.e., the eigenvalue bounds are maintained), while allowing for

In SPECT, no timing information can be retrieved to locate the primary source
photons. Monte Carlo methods allow an event-by-event simulation of the
scattering kinematics, which can be incorporated into a model of the imaging
system response. This approach was adopted since the late Nineties by several
authors, and recently took advantage of the increased computational power made
available by high-performance CPUs and GPUs. These recent developments enable a
fast image reconstruction with an improved image quality, compared to
deterministic approaches. Deterministic approaches are based on
energy-windowing of the detector response, and on the cumulative estimate and
subtraction of the scattering component. In this paper, we review the main
strategies and algorithms to correct for the scattering effect in SPECT and
focus on Monte Carlo developments, which nowadays allow the three-dimensional

task that has been partly overcome with recent advances in machine learning and
hardware design. Presently, deep neural networks can be deployed on embedded
targets to perform different tasks such as speech recognition,object detection
or Human Activity Recognition. However, there is still room for optimization of
deep neural networks onto embedded devices. These optimizations mainly address
power consumption,memory and real-time constraints, but also an easier
deployment at the edge. Moreover, there is still a need for a better
understanding of what can be achieved for different use cases. This work
focuses on quantization and deployment of deep neural networks onto low-power
32-bit microcontrollers. The quantization methods, relevant in the context of
an embedded execution onto a microcontroller, are first outlined. Then, a new
framework for end-to-end deep neural networks training, quantization and
deployment is presented. This framework, called MicroAI, is designed as an
alternative to existing inference engines (TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers
and STM32CubeAI). Our framework can indeed be easily adjusted and/or extended
for specific use cases. Execution using single precision 32-bit floating-point
as well as fixed-point on 8- and 16-bit integers are supported. The proposed
quantization method is evaluated with three different datasets (UCI-HAR, Spoken
MNIST and GTSRB). Finally, a comparison study between MicroAI and both existing
embedded inference engines is provided in terms of memory and power efficiency.
On-device evaluation is done using ARM Cortex-M4F-based microcontrollers (Ambiq
Apollo3 and STM32L452RE).

effect of degree constraints on general connected graphs. We give a new lower
bound, and the first non-trivial upper bound, on the maximum growth rate of the
number of connected sets of a cubic graph, and in fact obtain non-trivial upper

connected set density is bounded away from 1 for graphs with no vertex of

that in order for the connected set density to approach 1, the proportion of

obtained by complexifying the coupling constant. This produces a new theory
with many interesting features. Chief among them is the fact that scaling
functions such as Zamolodchikov's $c$-function display ""roaming"" behaviour,
that is, they visit the vicinity of an infinite number of conformal fixed
points, the unitary minimal models of conformal field theory. This rich
structure also makes the model an interesting candidate for study using the
generalized hydrodynamic approach to integrable quantum field theory (IQFT). By
studying hydrodynamic quantities such as the effective velocities of
quasiparticles we can develop a more physical picture of interaction in the
theory, both at and away from equilibrium. Indeed, we find that in the
staircase model the effective velocity displays monotonicity features not found
in any other IQFT. These admit a natural interpretation when investigated in
the context of the massless theories known as $\mathcal{M}A_k^{(+)}$ models,
which provide an effective description of massless flows between consecutive

Higher biological visual systems have evolved to track moving objects by

asks human observers and machines to track a target object in the midst of
identical-looking ""distractor"" objects. While humans effortlessly learn
PathTracker and generalize to systematic variations in task design,
state-of-the-art deep networks struggle. To address this limitation, we
identify and model circuit mechanisms in biological brains that are implicated
in tracking objects based on motion cues. When instantiated as a recurrent
network, our circuit model learns to solve PathTracker with a robust visual
strategy that rivals human performance and explains a significant proportion of
their decision-making on the challenge. We also show that the success of this

reproduce the puzzling weak dependence of mean size on host halo mass for both

and provides a unique testbed of the star formation process, which left
observable imprints on the spatial, kinematic, and temporal structure of its
stellar population. Taurus's rich observational history has uncovered
peculiarities that suggest a complicated star forming event, such as members at
large distances from the molecular clouds and evidence of an age spread. With
Gaia, an in-depth study of the Taurus census is possible to confirm membership,
identify substructure, and reconstruct its star formation history. We have
compiled an expansive census of the greater Taurus region, identifying spatial
subgroups and confirming that Taurus is substructured across stellar density.
There are two populations of subgroups: clustered groups near the clouds and
sparse groups spread throughout the region. The sparse groups comprise Taurus's
distributed population, which is on average older than the population near the
clouds, and hosts sub-populations up to 15 Myr old. The ages of the clustered
groups increase with distance, suggesting that the current star formation was
triggered from behind. Still, the region is kinematically coherent, and its
velocity structure reflects an initial turbulent spectrum similar to Larson's
Law that has been modified by dynamical relaxation. Overall, Taurus has a
complicated star formation history, with at least two epochs of star formation
featuring both clustered and distributed modes. Given the correlations between
age and spatial distribution, Taurus might be part of a galaxy-scale star
forming event that can only begin to be understood in the Gaia era.

fractional fillings. Here we show that the three-peak structure of Wannier
orbitals, dictated by the symmetry and topology of flat bands, facilitates the
emergence of a novel state at commensurate fractional filling of $\nu = n \pm
1/3$. We dub this state a ""fractional correlated insulator"". Specifically for
the filling of $\pm 1/3$ electrons per moir\'{e} unit cell, we show that
short-range interactions alone imply an approximate extensive entropy due to
the ""breathing"" degree of freedom of an irregular honeycomb lattice that
emerges through defect lines. The leading further-range interaction lifts this
degeneracy and selects a novel ferromagnetic nematic state that breaks AB/BA
sublattice symmetry. The proposed fractional correlated insulating state might
underlie the suppression of superconductivity at $\nu = 2-1/3$ filling observed
in arXiv:2004.04148. Further investigation of the proposed fractional
correlated insulating state would open doors to new regimes of correlation
effects in MATBG.

extreme inflows of gas down to the length scales of the central compact object.
Here, we estimate the maximum inflow rate allowed by gravity down to the
surface of supermassive stars, the possible progenitors of these supermassive
black holes. We use the continuity equation and the assumption of free-fall to
derive maximum allowed inflow rates for various density profiles. We apply our
approach to the mass-radius relation of rapidly accreting supermassive stars to
estimate an upper limit to the accretion rates allowed during the formation of
these objects. We find that the maximum allowed rate $\dot M_{\rm max}$ is
given uniquely by the compactness of the accretor. For the compactness of
rapidly accreting supermassive stars, $\dot M_{\rm max}$ is related to the
stellar mass $M$ by a power-law $\dot M_{\rm max}\propto M^{3/4}$. The rates of
atomically cooled halos (0.1 -- 10 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are allowed as soon as
$M\gtrsim1$ M$_\odot$. The largest rates expected in galaxy mergers
($10^4-10^5$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) become accessible once the accretor is
supermassive ($M\gtrsim10^4$ M$_\odot$). These results suggest that
supermassive stars can accrete up to masses $>10^6$ M$_\odot$ before they
collapse via the general-relativistic instability. At such masses, the collapse
is expected to lead to the direct formation of a supermassive black hole even
within metal-rich gas, resulting in a black hole seed that is significantly
heavier than in conventional direct collapse models for atomic cooling halos.

the star-forming (SF) galaxies sample and characterise them in terms of line
luminosity, stellar mass, SFR, and morphology. The final aim is to obtain the
H$\beta$ luminosity function (LF) of the SF galaxies at this redshift.
  We used the instrument OSIRIS at GTC to obtain the pseudo spectra of emission
line sources in the OTELO field. From these pseudo spectra, we identified the
objects with H$\beta$ emission. As the resolution of the pseudo spectra allowed
us to separate H$\beta$ from O[III], we derive the H$\beta$ flux without
contamination. Using data from the extended OTELO catalogue, we discriminated
AGNs and studied the SFR, the stellar mass, and the morphology of the SF
galaxies.
  We find that our sample is located on the main sequence of SF galaxies. The
sources are morphologically classified, mostly as disc-like galaxies (76%), and
90% of the sample are low-mass galaxies ($M_*<10^{10}\;\mathrm{M}_\odot$). The
low-mass SF galaxies at $z \sim 0.9$ that were detected by OTELO present
similar properties as low-mass SF galaxies in the local universe, suggesting
that these kinds of objects do not have a favorite epoch of formation and star
formation enhancement from $z \sim 1$ to now. Our sample of 40 H$\beta$ SF
galaxies includes the faintest H$\beta$ emitters detected so far. This allows
us to constrain the faint end of the LF for the H$\beta$ line alone with a
minimum luminosity of $\log L = 39 \;\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}$, which is a hundred
times fainter than previous surveys. The dust-corrected OTELO H$\beta$ LF
established the faint-end slope as $\alpha =-1.36\pm 0.15$. We increased the
scope of the analysis to the bright end by adding ancillary data from the
literature, which was not dust-corrected in this case. The obtained slope for
this extended LF is $\alpha = -1.43\pm 0.12$.

Following this trend, does a quantum system necessarily become `more chaotic'
when quantum fluctuations are reduced? Moreover, how do symmetry breaking and
associated non-trivial dynamics influence the interplay of quantum mechanics
and chaos? We explore these questions by computing
$\lambda_\mathrm{L}(\hbar,T)$ in the quantum spherical $p$-spin glass model,
where $\hbar$ can be continuously varied. We find that quantum fluctuations, in
general, make paramagnetic phase less and the replica symmetry-broken spin
glass phase more chaotic. We show that the approach to the classical limit
could be non-trivial, with non-monotonic dependence of $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ on
$\hbar$ close to the dynamical glass transition temperature $T_d$. Our results
in the classical limit ($\hbar\to 0$) naturally describe chaos in super-cooled
liquid in structural glasses. We find a maximum in $\lambda_\mathrm{L}(T)$
substantially above $T_d$, concomitant with the crossover from simple to slow
glassy relaxation. We further show that $\lambda_\mathrm{L}\sim T^\alpha$, with
the exponent $\alpha$ varying between 2 and 1 from quantum to classical limit,

  After evaluating the accuracy of existing geolocation databases, we analyze
the circumstances under which IP geolocation databases may be more or less
accurate. We find that geolocation databases are more accurate on fixed-line
than mobile networks, that IP addresses on university networks can be more
accurately located than those from consumer or business networks, and that
often the paid versions of these databases are not significantly more accurate
than the free versions. We then characterize how quickly subnets associated
with fixed-line networks change geographic locations, and how long residential
broadband ISP subscribers retain individual IP addresses. We find, generally,
that most IP address assignments are stable over two months, although stability
does vary across ISPs. Finally, we evaluate the suitability of existing IP
geolocation databases for understanding Internet access and performance in
human populations within specific geographies and demographics. Although the
median accuracy of IP geolocation is better than 3 km in some contexts, we
conclude that relying on IP geolocation databases to understand Internet access

used in diverse fields (e.g., ecology, economics, bibliometrics, politics) to
represent unipartite networks. A key challenge in analyzing such networks is
determining whether an observed number of co-occurrences between two nodes is
significant, and therefore whether an edge exists between them. One approach,
the fixed degree sequence model (FDSM), evaluates the significance of an edge's
weight by comparison to a null model in which the degree sequences of the
original bipartite network are fixed. Although the FDSM is an intuitive null
model, it is computationally expensive because it requires Monte Carlo
simulation to estimate each edge's $p$-value, and therefore is impractical for
large projections. In this paper, we explore four potential alternatives to
FDSM: fixed fill model (FFM), fixed row model (FRM), fixed column model (FCM),
and stochastic degree sequence model (SDSM). We compare these models to FDSM in
terms of accuracy, speed, statistical power, similarity, and ability to recover
known communities. We find that the computationally-fast SDSM offers a
statistically conservative but close approximation of the
computationally-impractical FDSM under a wide range of conditions, and that it
correctly recovers a known community structure even when the signal is weak.
Therefore, although each backbone model may have particular applications, we
recommend SDSM for extracting the backbone of bipartite projections when FDSM
is impractical.

kinetic and interaction effects come to life. As such, liquids are more
challenging to understand than either gases or solids generally. In weakly
interacting gases, the kinetic effects dominate. By contrast, low temperature
solids typically feature far smaller fluctuations about their ground state.
Notwithstanding their complexity, with the exception of quantum fluids and
supercooled liquids, various aspects of common liquid dynamics such as their
dynamic viscosity are often assumed to be given by rather simple,
Arrhenius-type, activated forms with nearly constant (i.e., temperature
independent) energy barriers. In this work, we analyze experimentally measured
viscosities of numerous liquids far above their equilibrium melting temperature
to see how well this assumption fares. We find, for the investigated liquids,
marked deviations from simple activated dynamics. Even far above their
equilibrium melting temperatures, as the temperature drops, the viscosity of
these liquids increases more strongly than predicted by activated dynamics
dominated by a single uniform energy barrier. For metallic fluids, the scale of
the prefactors of the best Arrhenius fits for the viscosity is typically
consistent with that given by the product $nh$ with $n$ the number density and
$h$ Planck's constant. In various fluids that we examined, $nh$ constitutes a
lower bound scale on the viscosity. We find that a scaling of the temperature
axis (complementing that of the viscosity) leads to a partial collapse of the
temperature dependent viscosities of different fluids; such a scaling allows
for a functional dependence of the viscosity on temperature that includes yet
is far more general than activated Arrhenius form alone. We speculate on
relations between non-Arrhenius dynamics and thermodynamic observables.

situation, an accurate urban building energy model (UBEM) is the foundation to
support the design of energy-efficient communities. However, current UBEM are
limited in their abilities to capture the inter-building interdependency due to
their dynamic and non-linear characteristics. Those models either ignored or
oversimplified these building interdependencies, which can substantially affect
the accuracy of urban energy modeling. To fill the research gap, this study
proposes a novel data-driven UBEM synthesizing the solar-based building

as an example to predict the hourly energy consumption. Furthermore, we tested
the feasibility of the proposed model by comparing the performance of the

for the successful treatment of patients with cancer; however, the accurate
detection of small BM lesions (< 15mm) remains a challenging task. We
previously described a framework for the detection of small BM in
single-sequence gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted 3D MRI datasets. It combined
classical image processing (IP) with a dedicated convolutional neural network,
taking approximately 30 seconds to process each dataset due to
computation-intensive IP stages. To overcome the speed limitation, this study
aims to reformulate the framework via an augmented pair of CNNs (eliminating
the IP) to reduce the processing times while preserving the BM detection
performance. Our previous implementation of the BM detection algorithm utilized
Laplacian of Gaussians (LoG) for the candidate selection portion of the
solution. In this study, we introduce a novel BM candidate detection CNN

(1) a similar receptive field as the LoG method, and (2) a bias for the

  parameters in dynamic systems",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identification of parameters in ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is an
important and challenging task when modeling dynamic systems in biomedical
research and other scientific areas, especially with the presence of
time-varying parameters. This article proposes a fast and accurate method,
TVMAGI (Time-Varying MAnifold-constrained Gaussian process Inference), to
estimate both time-constant and time-varying parameters in the ODE using noisy
and sparse observation data. TVMAGI imposes a Gaussian process model over the
time series of system components as well as time-varying parameters, and
restricts the derivative process to satisfy ODE conditions. Consequently,
TVMAGI completely bypasses numerical integration and achieves substantial
savings in computation time. By incorporating the ODE structures through
manifold constraints, TVMAGI enjoys a principled statistical construct under
the Bayesian paradigm, which further enables it to handle systems with missing
data or unobserved components. The Gaussian process prior also alleviates the
identifiability issue often associated with the time-varying parameters in ODE.
Unlike existing approaches, TVMAGI can be applied to general nonlinear systems
without specific structural assumptions. Three simulation examples, including
an infectious disease compartmental model, are provided to illustrate the
robustness and efficiency of our method compared with numerical integration and
Bayesian filtering methods.

recently emerged from the study of Galois modules related to classical

these decompositions is their stunning simplicity: almost all summands are free
over some quotient ring. The non-free summands which appear are exceptional not
only because they are different in form, but because they play the key role in
controlling arithmetic conditions that allow the remaining summands to be
easily described. In this way, these exceptional summands are the lynchpin for
a bevy of new properties of absolute Galois groups that have been gleaned from
these surprising decompositions.
  In one such recent decomposition, a remarkable new exceptional summand was
discovered which exhibited interesting properties that have not been seen
before. The exceptional summand is drawn from a particular finite family that
has not yet been investigated. The main goal of this paper is to introduce this
family of modules and verify their indecomposability. We believe this module
will be of interest to people working in Galois theory, representation theory,

interesting new tools, including analogs of $p$-adic expansions.

other is to not complete the navigation task in time due to excessive collision
avoidance.As a result, we propose the R-SARL framework, which is based on a
deep reinforcement learning algorithm and where we augment the reward function
to avoid collisions. In particular, we estimate unsafe interactions between the
robot and obstacles in a look-ahead distance and penalize accordingly, so that
the robot can avoid collisions in advance and reach its destination
safely.Furthermore, we penalize frequent excessive detours to reduce the

confidentiality is distinct from privacy in an enterprise context, and aims to
formulate an approach to preserving confidentiality while leveraging principles

techniques to natural language processing tasks usually assume independently
distributed data, and overlook potential correlation among the records.
Ignoring this correlation results in a fictional promise of privacy. Naively
extending differential privacy techniques to focus on group privacy instead of
record-level privacy is a straightforward approach to mitigate this issue. This
approach, although providing a more realistic privacy-guarantee, is
over-cautious and severely impacts model utility. We show this gap between
these two extreme measures of privacy over two language tasks, and introduce a
middle-ground solution. We propose a model that captures the correlation in the

expected to be heterogeneous; i.e., they should differ from those homogeneous
ensembles of homopolymers that harbor an essentially unique relationship
between average values of end-to-end distance $R_{\rm EE}$ and radius of
gyration $R_{\rm g}$. It was posited recently, however, that small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) data on conformational dimensions of disordered proteins can
be rationalized almost exclusively by homopolymer ensembles. Assessing this
perspective, chain-model simulations are used to evaluate the discriminatory
power of SAXS-determined molecular form factors (MFFs) with regard to
homogeneous versus heterogeneous ensembles. The general approach adopted here
is not bound by any assumption about ensemble encodability, in that the
postulated heterogeneous ensembles we evaluated are not restricted to those
entailed by simple interaction schemes. Our analysis of MFFs for certain
heterogeneous ensembles with more narrowly distributed $R_{\rm EE}$ and $R_{\rm
g}$ indicates that while they deviates from MFFs of homogeneous ensembles, the
differences can be rather small. Remarkably, some heterogeneous ensembles with
asphericity and $R_{\rm EE}$ drastically different from those of homogeneous
ensembles can nonetheless exhibit practically identical MFFs, demonstrating
that SAXS MFFs do not afford unique characterizations of basic properties of
conformational ensembles in general. In other words, the ensemble to MFF
mapping is practically many-to-one and likely non-smooth. Heteropolymeric
variations of the $R_{\rm EE}$--$R_{\rm g}$ relationship were further showcased

building user interfaces (UI) is one of the core software engineering tasks. It
consists in designing, implementing and testing ever more sophisticated and
versatile ways for users to interact with software systems, and safely
connecting these interactions with commands querying or modifying their state.
However, most UI frameworks still rely on a low level model, the bare bone UI
event processing model. This model was suitable for the rather simple UIs of
the early 80s (menus, buttons, keyboards, mouse clicks), but now exhibits major
software engineering flaws for modern, highly interactive UIs. These flaws
include lack of separation of concerns, weak modularity and thus low
reusability of code for advanced interactions, as well as low testability. To
mitigate these flaws, we propose Interacto as a high level user interaction
processing model. By reifying the concept of user interaction, Interacto makes
it easy to design, implement and test modular and reusable advanced user
interactions, and to connect them to commands with built-in undo/redo support.
To demonstrate its applicability and generality, we briefly present two open
source implementations of Interacto for Java/JavaFX and TypeScript/Angular. We
evaluate Interacto interest (1) on a real world case study, where it has been
used since 2013, and with (2) a controlled experiment with 44 master students,
comparing it with traditionnal UI frameworks.

The present article applies machine learning approach to study contribution of
different flow-based features with practical fluid mechanics applications for
reconstruction of the missing data of turbomachinery PIV measurements. Support
vector regression (SVR) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are selected as two
robust regressors capable of modelling non-linear fluid flow phenomena. The
proposed flow-based features are optimally scaled and filtered to extract the
best configuration. In addition to conventional data-based validation of the
regressors, a metric is proposed that reflects mass conservation law as an
important requirement for a physical flow reproduction. For a velocity field
including 25% of clustered missing data, the reconstruction accuracy achieved
by SVR in terms of R2-score is as high as 0.993 for the in-plane velocity
vectors in comparison with that obtained by MLP which is up to 0.981. In terms
of mass conservation metric, the SVR model by R2-score up to 0.96 is
considerably more accurate than the MLP estimator. For extremely sparse data
with a gappiness of 75%, vector and contour plots from SVR and MLP were
consistent with those of the original field.

the limited data set hinders the estimate of the Value function of the relative

deployment of a wrong policy can lead to catastrophic consequences. For this
reason, several pathways are being followed with the scope of reducing the
model error (or the distributional shift between the learned model and the true

uncertainty. But when it comes to the final application which baseline should a
practitioner choose? In an offline context where computational time is not an
issue and robustness is the priority we propose Exploitation vs Caution (EvC),
a paradigm that (1) elegantly incorporates model uncertainty abiding by the
Bayesian formalism, and (2) selects the policy that maximizes a risk-aware
objective over the Bayesian posterior between a fixed set of candidate policies
provided, for instance, by the current baselines. We validate EvC with
state-of-the-art approaches in different discrete, yet simple, environments
offering a fair variety of MDP classes. In the tested scenarios EvC manages to
select robust policies and hence stands out as a useful tool for practitioners

10 square degrees, with continuum photometry spanning from 160um to 3mm. These

analyses some of the current state-of-the-art intrusion detection methods and
discusses their pros and cons. Further, a review of different ML methods is
carried out with four methods showing to be the most suitable one for
classifying attacks. Several algorithms are selected and investigated to
evaluate the performance of IDS. These IDS classifies binary and multiclass
attacks in terms of detecting whether or not the traffic has been considered as
benign or an attack. The experimental results demonstrate that binary
classification has greater consistency in their accuracy results which ranged
from 0.9938 to 0.9977, while multiclass ranges from 0.9294 to 0.9983. However,
it has been also observed that multiclass provides the best results with the
algorithm k-Nearest neighbor giving an accuracy score of 0.9983 while the
binary classification highest score is 0.9977 from Random Forest. The
experimental results demonstrate that multiclass classification produces better
performance in terms of intrusion detection by specifically differentiating
between the attacks and allowing a more targeted response to an attack.

long-baseline-interferometric observations confirm that $\nu$ Gem is a
hierarchical triple system. It consists of an inner binary composed of two
B-type stars and an outer classical Be star. Several photospheric spectral
lines of the inner components were disentangled, revealing two stars with very
different rotational broadening ($\sim$260 and $\sim$140 kms$^{-1}$,
respectively), while the photospheric lines of the Be star remain undetected.
From the combined spectroscopic and astrometric orbital solution it is not
possible to unambiguously cross-identify the inner astrometric components with
the spectroscopic components. In the preferred solution based on modeling of
the disentangled line profiles, the inner binary is composed of two stars with
nearly identical masses of 3.3 M$_\odot$ and the more rapidly rotating star is
the fainter one. These two stars are in a marginally elliptical orbit ($e$ =
0.06) about each other with a period of 53.8 d. The third star also has a mass
of 3.3 M$_\odot$ and follows a more eccentric ($e$ = 0.24) orbit with a period
of 19.1 yr. The two orbits are co-directional and, at inclinations of
79$^{\circ}$ and 76$^{\circ}$ of the inner and the outer orbit, respectively,
about coplanar. No astrometric or spectroscopic evidence could be found that
the Be star itself is double. The system appears dynamically stable and not
subject to eccentric Lidov-Kozai oscillations. After disentangling, the spectra
of the components of the inner binary do not exhibit peculiarities that would
be indicative of past interactions. Motivations for a wide range of follow-up
studies are suggested.

interfacial dipole, thereby tuning the band alignment from type-II to type-III.
The transferred charge, resulting in built-in electric fields, and change in
band alignment are manifested in electrical transport and hard x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Ab initio models reveal the interplay

transition rates of a single vertex being linear function of its neighborhood.
A simple way to approximate such processes is by a system of ODEs called the

HMFA is guaranteed to be the large graph limit of the stochastic dynamics on a
finite time horizon if and only if the graph-sequence is quasi-random. Explicit
error bound is given and being of order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ plus the largest
discrepancy of the graph. For Erd\H{o}s R\'{e}nyi and random regular graphs we
show an error bound of order the inverse square root of the average degree. In
general, diverging average degrees is shown to be a necessary condition for the
HMFA to be accurate. Under special conditions, some of these results also apply
to more detailed type of approximations like the inhomogenous mean field
approximation (IHMFA). We pay special attention to epidemic applications such

neutron skin in 208Pb (Rskin208) has challenged our understanding of neutron
rich matter in the vicinity of nuclear saturation density. Whereas earlier
constraints indicate that the symmetry energy is relatively soft, the PREX-2
result seems to suggest the opposite. We confront constraints on the symmetry
energy obtained from measurements of the electric dipole polarizability against
those informed by the PREX-2 measurement of Rskin208 and by the correlations
that it entails. Covariant energy density functionals informed by the
properties of finite nuclei are used to compute the electric dipole response of
48Ca, 68Ni, 132Sn, and 208Pb. The set of functionals used in this work are
consistent with experimental data, yet are flexible enough in that they span a
wide range of values of Rskin208. It is found that theoretical predictions of
the electric dipole polarizability that are consistent with the PREX-2
measurement systematically overestimate the corresponding values extracted from
the direct measurements of the distribution of electric dipole strength. The
neutron skin thickness of 208Pb extracted from parity violating electron
scattering and the electric dipole polarizability measured in photoabsorption
experiments are two of the cleanest experimental tools used to constrain the
symmetry energy around nuclear saturation density. However, the recent value of
Rskin208 that suggests a fairly stiff symmetry energy stands in stark contrast
to the conclusions derived from the electric dipole polarizability. At present,
we offer no solution to this dilemma.

look up relevant information to comprehend a scientific text, we present a
novel framework that utilizes external knowledge for joint entity and relation
extraction named KECI (Knowledge-Enhanced Collective Inference). Given an input
text, KECI first constructs an initial span graph representing its initial
understanding of the text. It then uses an entity linker to form a knowledge
graph containing relevant background knowledge for the the entity mentions in
the text. To make the final predictions, KECI fuses the initial span graph and
the knowledge graph into a more refined graph using an attention mechanism.
KECI takes a collective approach to link mention spans to entities by
integrating global relational information into local representations using
graph convolutional networks. Our experimental results show that the framework
is highly effective, achieving new state-of-the-art results in two different
benchmark datasets: BioRelEx (binding interaction detection) and ADE (adverse

optimization over a rolling time horizon with a model predictive control (MPC)
component that relocates idle vehicles to anticipate the demand. The MPC
optimization operates over a longer time horizon to compensate for the inherent
myopic nature of the real-time dispatching. These longer time horizons are
beneficial for the quality of relocation decisions but increase computational
complexity. Consequently, the ride-sharing operators are often forced to use a
relatively short time horizon. To address this computational challenge, this
paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines machine learning and
optimization. The machine-learning component learns the optimal solution to the
MPC on the aggregated level to overcome the sparsity and high-dimensionality of
the solution. The optimization component transforms the machine-learning
prediction back to the original granularity through a tractable transportation
model. As a consequence, the original NP-hard MPC problem is reduced to a
polynomial time prediction and optimization, which allows the ride-sharing
operators to consider a longer time horizon. Experimental results show that the
hybrid approach achieves significantly better service quality than the MPC
optimization in terms of average rider waiting time, due to its ability to

hence, a common learning rate can be used. In this work, we relax this

optimizer learns a dynamic learning rate for each instance present in the

optimization framework to focus on different modes of training data during
optimization. When applied to an image classification task, across different

characterisation of small exoplanets around cool stars, as it can induce radial
velocity (RV) signals that can hide or mimic the presence of planetary
companions. Several indicators of stellar activity are routinely used to
identify activity-related signals in RVs, but not all indicators trace exactly
the same activity effects, nor are any of them always effective in all stars.
We evaluate the performance of a set of spectroscopic activity indicators for M
dwarf stars with different masses and activity levels with the aim of finding a
relation between the indicators and stellar properties. In a sample of 98 M
dwarfs observed with CARMENES, we analyse the temporal behaviour of RVs and
nine spectroscopic activity indicators: cross-correlation function (CCF)
full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), contrast, and bisector inverse slope (BIS),
chromatic index (CRX), differential line width (dLW), and indices of the
chromospheric lines H$\alpha$ and calcium infrared triplet. A total of 56 stars
of the initial sample show periodic signals related to activity in at least one
of these ten parameters. RV is the parameter for which most of the targets show
an activity-related signal. CRX and BIS are effective activity tracers for the
most active stars in the sample, especially stars with a relatively high mass,
while for less active stars, chromospheric lines perform best. FWHM and dLW
show a similar behaviour in all mass and activity regimes, with the highest
number of activity detections in the low-mass, high-activity regime. Most of
the targets for which we cannot identify any activity-related signals are stars
at the low-mass end of the sample. These low-mass stars also show the lowest RV
scatter, which indicates that ultracool M dwarfs could be better candidates for
planet searches than earlier types, which show larger RV jitter.

lacks a number of high-level programming abstractions such as higher-order
functions, polymorphism, strong static typing, memory safety, and automatic
memory management.
  We present Hailstorm, a statically-typed, purely functional programming
language that attempts to address the above problem. It is a high-level
programming language with a strict typing discipline. It supports features like
higher-order functions, tail-recursion, and automatic memory management, to
program IoT devices in a declarative manner. Applications running on these
devices tend to be heavily dominated by I/O. Hailstorm tracks side effects
likeI/O in its type system using resource types. This choice allowed us to
explore the design of a purely functional standalone language, in an area where
it is more common to embed a functional core in an imperative shell. The
language borrows the combinators of arrowized FRP, but has discrete-time
semantics. The design of the full set of combinators is work in progress,
driven by examples. So far, we have evaluated Hailstorm by writing standard
examples from the literature (earthquake detection, a railway crossing system
and various other clocked systems), and also running examples on the GRiSP
embedded systems board, through generation of Erlang.

experience; how VCAs perform under temporary reductions in available capacity;
how they compete with themselves, with each other, and with other applications;
and how usage modality (e.g., number of participants) affects utilization. We
study three modern VCAs: Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Answers to
these questions differ substantially depending on VCA. First, the average
utilization on an unconstrained link varies between 0.8 Mbps and 1.9 Mbps.
Given temporary reduction of capacity, some VCAs can take as long as 50 seconds
to recover to steady state. Differences in proprietary congestion control
algorithms also result in unfair bandwidth allocations: in constrained
bandwidth settings, one Zoom video conference can consume more than 75% of the
available bandwidth when competing with another VCA (e.g., Meet, Teams). For
some VCAs, client utilization can decrease as the number of participants
increases, due to the reduced video resolution of each participant's video
stream given a larger number of participants. Finally, one participant's
viewing mode (e.g., pinning a speaker) can affect the upstream utilization of

COVID-19 spreading mechanism, the age-dependent immune system reaction, and
thus for policymaking. We hereby develop a method to analyze viral-load
distribution data as a function of the patients' age within a flexible,
non-parametric, hierarchical, Bayesian, and causal model. The causal nature of
the developed reconstruction additionally allows to test for bias in the data.
This could be due to, e.g., bias in patient-testing and data collection or
systematic errors in the measurement of the viral load. We perform these tests
by calculating the Bayesian evidence for each implied possible causal
direction. The possibility of testing for bias in data collection and
identifying causal directions can be very useful in other contexts as well. For
this reason we make our model freely available. When applied to publicly
available age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load data, we find a statistically
significant increase in the viral load with age, but only for one of the two
analyzed datasets. If we consider this dataset, and based on the current
understanding of viral load's impact on patients' infectivity, we expect a
non-negligible difference in the infectivity of different age groups. This
difference is nonetheless too small to justify considering any age group as

multirate explicit time-stepping schemes (SSPRK2-SE and SSPRK3-SE) for the
resulting split system in this paper. The proposed schemes allow for a large
time step to be used for the three-dimensional baroclinic (slow) mode and a
small time step for the two-dimensional barotropic (fast) mode, in which each
of the two mode solves just need to satisfy their respective CFL conditions for
numerical stability. Specifically, at each time step, the baroclinic velocity
is first computed by advancing the baroclinic mode and fluid thickness of the
system with the large time-step \textcolor{black}{and the assistance of some
intermediate approximations of the baroctropic mode obtained by substepping
with the small-time step}; then the barotropic velocity is corrected by using
the small time step to re-advance the barotropic mode under an improved
barotropic forcing produced by interpolation of the forcing terms from the
preceding baroclinic mode solves; lastly, the fluid thickness is updated by
coupling the baroclinic and barotropic velocities. Additionally, numerical
inconsistencies on the discretized sea surface height caused by the mode
splitting are relieved via a reconciliation process with carefully calculated
flux deficits. Two benchmark tests from the ""MPAS-Ocean"" platform are carried
out to numerically demonstrate the performance and parallel scalability of the

of conjectures of Oliveira about comparison of the $\epsilon$ mixing time of

${\rm IP}(1)$, denoted ${\rm RW}(k)$, and of Caputo about comparison of the

1k\wedge\frac 14$ for vertex-transitive graphs of constant degree, as well as
for general graphs satisfying a mild (""transience-like"") heat-kernel condition.
In the case where the particles occupying a hyperedge $e$ are permuted
uniformly at random when $e$ rings we obtain results bounding the spectral gap
of ${\rm IP}(k)$ in terms of that ${\rm RW}(1)$. The proof does not use Morris'
chameleon process. It can be seen as a rigorous and direct way of arguing that

elaborated on top of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning

of convolutional neural network (CNN) on proposed Inst2Vec features. The
framework clusters the detected malware samples into malware family groups
utilizing sample feature digests generated using deep neural auto-encoder. For
change adaptation, PetaDroid leverages the detection confidence probability
during deployment to automatically collect extension datasets and periodically
use them to build new malware detection models. Besides, PetaDroid uses
code-fragment randomization during the training to enhance the resiliency to
common obfuscation techniques. We extensively evaluated PetaDroid on multiple

efficient training, high-capacity function approximation, and strong priors on
model space. This makes them a natural choice for modelling many types of
temporal dynamics. Training a Neural SDE (either as a VAE or as a GAN) requires
backpropagating through an SDE solve. This may be done by solving a
backwards-in-time SDE whose solution is the desired parameter gradients.
However, this has previously suffered from severe speed and accuracy issues,
due to high computational cost and numerical truncation errors. Here, we
overcome these issues through several technical innovations. First, we
introduce the \textit{reversible Heun method}. This is a new SDE solver that is
\textit{algebraically reversible}: eliminating numerical gradient errors, and
the first such solver of which we are aware. Moreover it requires half as many
function evaluations as comparable solvers, giving up to a $1.98\times$
speedup. Second, we introduce the \textit{Brownian Interval}: a new, fast,
memory efficient, and exact way of sampling \textit{and reconstructing}
Brownian motion. With this we obtain up to a $10.6\times$ speed improvement
over previous techniques, which in contrast are both approximate and relatively
slow. Third, when specifically training Neural SDEs as GANs (Kidger et al.
2021), we demonstrate how SDE-GANs may be trained through careful weight
clipping and choice of activation function. This reduces computational cost
(giving up to a $1.87\times$ speedup) and removes the numerical truncation
errors associated with gradient penalty. Altogether, we outperform the
state-of-the-art by substantial margins, with respect to training speed, and
with respect to classification, prediction, and MMD test metrics. We have
contributed implementations of all of our techniques to the torchsde library to
help facilitate their adoption.

graph-based approaches for analyzing the brain connectome have provided
insights into the functions of the human brain. The development of graph neural
networks (GNNs) capable of learning representation from graph structured data
has led to increased interest in learning the graph representation of the brain
connectome. Although recent attempts to apply GNN to the FC network have shown
promising results, there is still a common limitation that they usually do not

the constancy regions of the unknown signal, using the
computationally-efficient dyadic classification and regression tree (DCART)
methodology proposed by \citep{donoho1997cart}. We prove that, under
appropriate regularity conditions on the shape of the partition elements, a
DCART-based procedure consistently estimates the underlying partition at a rate
of order $\sigma^2 k^* \log (N)/\kappa^2$, where $k^*$ is the minimal number of
rectangular sub-graphs obtained using recursive dyadic partitions supporting
the signal partition, $\sigma^2$ is the noise variance, $\kappa$ is the minimal
magnitude of the signal difference among contiguous elements of the partition

our method attains a sharper estimation error of order
$\sigma^2\log(N)/\kappa^2$, independent of $k^*$, which we show to be minimax
rate optimal. Our theoretical guarantees further extend to the partition
estimator based on the optimal regression tree estimator (ORT) of
\cite{chatterjee2019adaptive} and to the one obtained through an NP-hard

the Arecibo Fast Legacy ALFA Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find
that the shapes of $M_{\rm HI}$-$M_{\rm h}$ and $M_{\rm HI}$-$M_\ast$ relations
are remarkably similar for both star-forming and quenched galaxies, with
massive quenched galaxies having constantly lower HI masses of around 0.6 dex.
This similarity strongly suggests that neither halo mass nor stellar mass is
the direct cause of quenching, but rather the depletion of HI reservoir. While
the HI reservoir for low-mass galaxies of $M_\ast<10^{10.5}M_\odot$ strongly
increases with $M_{\rm h}$, more massive galaxies show no significant
dependence of $M_{\rm HI}$ on $M_{\rm h}$, indicating the effect of halo to
determine the smooth cold gas accretion. We find that the star formation and
quenching of central galaxies are directly regulated by the available HI
reservoir, with an average relation of ${\rm SFR}\propto M_{\rm
HI}^{2.75}/M_\ast^{0.40}$, implying a quasi-steady state of star formation. We
further confirm that galaxies are depleted of their HI reservoir once they drop
off the star-formation main sequence and there is a very tight and consistent
correlation between $M_{\rm HI}$ and $\Sigma_1$ in this phase, with $M_{\rm
HI}\propto\Sigma_1^{-2}$. This result is in consistent with the
compaction-triggered quenching scenario, with galaxies going through three
evolutionary phases of cold gas accretion, compaction and post-compaction, and
quenching.

strategies in using the ground states in critical many-body probes for
parameter estimation, we only consider partial access to a subsystem. Due to
the periodicity of the dynamics, any local block of the system saturates to a
steady state which allows achieving sensing precision well beyond the classical
limit, almost reaching the Heisenberg bound. We associate the enhanced quantum
precision to closing of the Floquet gap, resembling the features of quantum
sensing in the ground state of critical systems. We show that the proposed

Recently, several unsupervised clustering algorithms have been developed to
help extract and separate distinct features from single-molecule transport
data. However, these clustering approaches have been primarily designed and
used to extract major dataset components, and are consequently likely to
struggle with identifying very rare features and behaviors which may
nonetheless contain physically meaningful information. In this work, we thus
introduce a completely new analysis framework specifically designed for rare
event detection in single-molecule break junction data to help unlock such
information and provide a new perspective with different implicit assumptions
than clustering. Our approach leverages the concept of correlations of breaking
traces with their own history to robustly identify paths through
distance-conductance space that correspond to reproducible rare behaviors. As
both a demonstrative and important example, we focus on rare conductance
plateaus for short molecules, which can be essentially invisible when examining
raw data. We show that our grid-based correlation tools successfully and
reproducibly locate these rare plateaus in real experimental datasets,
including in situations that traditional clustering approaches find
challenging. This result enables a broader variety of molecules to be

synchronization between two magnon modes is mainly dependent on resonance
frequency of the cavity caused by direction of input currents. In
addition,quantum synchronization is enhanced by the increase of interaction
strength between two Bogoliubov modes and cavity mode. Moreover, numerical
simulation results with parameters commonly used in current experiments show
that the present scheme may be feasible.

pseudospectral (PS) and one of the improved finite-difference (FD) schemes. We
find that scaling properties are affected by long-range temporal correlations
within the effective temporally correlated regions. Our results are consistent
with each other using these two independent numerical schemes, three
characteristic roughness exponents (global roughness exponent $\alpha$, local
roughness exponent $\alpha_{loc}$, and spectral roughness exponent
$\alpha_{s}$) are approximately equal within the small temporally correlated
regime, and satisfy $\alpha_{loc} \approx \alpha<\alpha_{s}$ for the large
temporally correlated regime, and the difference between $\alpha_{s}$ and
$\alpha$ increases with increasing the temporal correlation exponent $\theta$.
Our results also show that PS and the improved FD schemes could effectively
suppress numerical instabilities in the temporally correlated KPZ growth
equation. Furthermore, our investigations suggest that when the effects of
long-range temporal correlation are present, the continuum and discrete growth
systems do not belong to the same universality class with the same temporal

studied previously in the context of NMR, where the shielding tensor was

and cannot be treated perturbatively. Thus, in the interest of the
astrophysical and astrochemical community, this review aims to elaborate on the
computational advancements in quantum mechanics from Hartree-Fock (HF) to
Density Functional Theory (DFT), in the context of molecules in a high (and
ultrahigh) magnetic field. It is found that the mean-field approximation of
electron-electron correlation, as in the case of Hartree-Fock Theory, yields
inaccurate results. On the contrary, CCSD and DFT are found to overcome these
challenges. However, treating eletron-electron correlations in DFT can be
challenging for heavier ions as transition metals. To circumvent this, we
propose the use of DFT/CCSD along with effective Hamiltonian methods, which are

Gaussian Processes and could confidently detect Hot Jupiters with
semi-amplitude of 100 $m.s^{-1}$ buried in the stellar activity. We also showed

appropriate assumptions, we propose more concise coarse basis functions for
general Hermitian positive and definite discrete systems, and establish the
algorithmic and theoretical frameworks of the corresponding TL-OS methods.
Furthermore, to enhance the practicability of the algorithm, we design two
economical TL-OS preconditioners and prove the condition number estimate. As
the first application of the frameworks, we prove that the assumptions hold for
the linear finite element discretization of second order elliptic problem with
high contrast and oscillatory coefficient and the condition number of the TL-OS
preconditioned system is robust with respect to the model and mesh parameters.
In particular, we also prove that the condition number of the economically
preconditioned system is independent of the jump range under a certain jump
distribution. Experimental results show that the first kind of economical
preconditioner is more efficient and stable than the existed one. Secondly, we
construct TL-OS and the economical TL-OS preconditioners for the plane wave
least squares discrete system of Helmholtz equation by using the frameworks.
The numerical results for homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases illustrate that
the PCG method based on the proposed preconditioners have good stability in
terms of the angular frequency, mesh parameters and the number of degrees of
freedom in each element.

the first three years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y3) covering
4132 deg$^2$. These galaxy-galaxy measurements are used in the DES Y3
3$\times$2pt cosmological analysis, which combines weak lensing and galaxy
clustering information. We use two lens samples: a magnitude-limited sample and
the redMaGic sample, which span the redshift range $\sim 0.2-1$ with 10.7 M and
2.6 M galaxies respectively. For the source catalog, we use the Metacalibration
shape sample, consisting of $\simeq$100 M galaxies separated into 4 tomographic
bins. Our galaxy-galaxy lensing estimator is the mean tangential shear, for
which we obtain a total S/N of $\sim$148 for MagLim ($\sim$120 for redMaGic),
and $\sim$67 ($\sim$55) after applying the scale cuts of 6 Mpc/$h$. Thus we
reach percent-level statistical precision, which requires that our modeling and
systematic-error control be of comparable accuracy. The tangential shear model
used in the 3$\times$2pt cosmological analysis includes lens magnification, a
five-parameter intrinsic alignment model (TATT), marginalization over a
point-mass to remove information from small scales and a linear galaxy bias
model validated with higher-order terms. We explore the impact of these choices
on the tangential shear observable and study the significance of effects not
included in our model, such as reduced shear, source magnification and source
clustering. We also test the robustness of our measurements to various
observational and systematics effects, such as the impact of observing
conditions, lens-source clustering, random-point subtraction, scale-dependent
Metacalibration responses, PSF residuals, and B-modes.

ratios of small-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements around the same lens
sample to constrain source redshift uncertainties, intrinsic alignments and
other nuisance parameters of our model. Instead of using a simple geometric
approach for the ratios, we use the full modeling of the galaxy-galaxy lensing
measurements, including the corresponding integration over the power spectrum
and the contributions from intrinsic alignments and lens magnification. We
perform extensive testing of the small-scale shear ratio (SR) modeling by
studying the impact of different effects such as the inclusion of baryonic
physics, non-linear biasing, halo occupation distribution descriptions and lens
magnification, among others, and using realistic $N$-body simulations. We
validate the robustness of our constraints in the data by using two independent
lens samples, and by deriving constraints using the corresponding large-scale
ratios for which the modeling is simpler. The DES Y3 results demonstrate how
the ratios provide significant improvements in constraining power for several
nuisance parameters in our model, especially on source redshift calibration and
intrinsic alignments (IA). For source redshifts, SR improves the constraints
from the prior by up to 38\% in some redshift bins. Such improvements, and
especially the constraints it provides on IA, translate to tighter cosmological
constraints when SR is combined with cosmic shear and other 2pt functions. In
particular, for the DES Y3 data, SR improves $S_8$ constraints from cosmic
shear by up to 31\%, and for the full combination of probes (3$\times$2pt) by
up to 10\%. The shear ratios presented in this work are used as an additional
likelihood for cosmic shear, 2$\times$2pt and the full 3$\times$2pt in the
fiducial DES Y3 cosmological analysis.

(2021), presents the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 cosmic shear measurements and
cosmological constraints based on an analysis of over 100 million source
galaxies. With the data spanning 4143 deg$^2$ on the sky, divided into four
redshift bins, we produce the highest significance measurement of cosmic shear
to date, with a signal-to-noise of 40. We conduct a blind analysis in the
context of the $\Lambda$CDM model and find a 3% constraint of the clustering
amplitude, $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} =
0.759^{+0.025}_{-0.023}$. A $\Lambda$CDM-Optimized analysis, which safely
includes smaller scale information, yields a 2% precision measurement of $S_8=
0.772^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$ that is consistent with the fiducial case. The two
low-redshift measurements are statistically consistent with the Planck Cosmic
Microwave Background result, however, both recovered $S_8$ values are lower
than the high-redshift prediction by $2.3\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ ($p$-values of
0.02 and 0.05), respectively. The measurements are shown to be internally
consistent across redshift bins, angular scales and correlation functions. The
analysis is demonstrated to be robust to calibration systematics, with the
$S_8$ posterior consistent when varying the choice of redshift calibration
sample, the modeling of redshift uncertainty and methodology. Similarly, we
find that the corrections included to account for the blending of galaxies
shifts our best-fit $S_8$ by $0.5\sigma$ without incurring a substantial
increase in uncertainty. We examine the limiting factors for the precision of
the cosmological constraints and find observational systematics to be
subdominant to the modeling of astrophysics. Specifically, we identify the
uncertainties in modeling baryonic effects and intrinsic alignments as the
limiting systematics.

parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_\textrm{m}/0.3}$ at the 3% level in
$\Lambda$CDM: $S_8=0.759^{+0.025}_{-0.023}$ (68% CL). Our constraint is at the
2% level when using angular scale cuts that are optimized for the $\Lambda$CDM
analysis: $S_8=0.772^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$ (68% CL). With cosmic shear alone, we
find no statistically significant constraint on the dark energy
equation-of-state parameter at our present statistical power. We carry out our
analysis blind, and compare our measurement with constraints from two other
contemporary weak-lensing experiments: the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) and
Hyper-Suprime Camera Subaru Strategic Program (HSC). We additionally quantify
the agreement between our data and external constraints from the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB). Our DES Y3 result under the assumption of
$\Lambda$CDM is found to be in statistical agreement with Planck 2018, although
favors a lower $S_8$ than the CMB-inferred value by $2.3\sigma$ (a $p$-value of
0.02). This paper explores the robustness of these cosmic shear results to
modeling of intrinsic alignments, the matter power spectrum and baryonic
physics. We additionally explore the statistical preference of our data for
intrinsic alignment models of different complexity. The fiducial cosmic shear
model is tested using synthetic data, and we report no biases greater than
0.3$\sigma$ in the plane of $S_8\times\Omega_\textrm{m}$ caused by
uncertainties in the theoretical models.

galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Dark Energy
Survey Year-3 data. We describe our modeling framework, and choice of scales
analyzed, validating their robustness to theoretical uncertainties in
small-scale clustering by analyzing simulated data. Using a linear galaxy bias
model and redMaGiC galaxy sample, we obtain constraints on the matter density
to be $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.325^{+0.033}_{-0.034}$. We also implement a
non-linear galaxy bias model to probe smaller scales that includes
parameterization based on hybrid perturbation theory and find that it leads to
a 17% gain in cosmological constraining power. We perform robustness tests of
our methodology pipeline and demonstrate the stability of the constraints to
changes in the theoretical model. Using the redMaGiC galaxy sample as
foreground lens galaxies, we find the galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy
lensing measurements to exhibit significant signals akin to de-correlation
between galaxies and mass on large scales, which is not expected in any current
models. This likely systematic measurement error biases our constraints on
galaxy bias and the $S_8$ parameter. We find that a scale-, redshift- and
sky-area-independent phenomenological de-correlation parameter can effectively
capture the impact of this systematic error. We trace the source of this
de-correlation to a color-dependent photometric issue and minimize its impact
on our result by changing the selection criteria of redMaGiC galaxies. Using
this new sample, our constraints on the $S_8$ parameter are consistent with
previous studies, and we find a small shift in the $\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints
compared to the fiducial redMaGiC sample. We constrain the mean host halo mass
of the redMaGiC galaxies in this new sample to be approximately $1.6 \times
10^{13} M_{\odot}/h$.

are the clustering of galaxies and the tangential shear of background galaxy
shapes produced by those foreground galaxies, so-called galaxy-galaxy lensing.
Combining the measurements of these two two-point functions leads to
cosmological constraints that are independent of the galaxy bias factor. The
optimal choice of foreground, or lens, galaxies is governed by the joint, but
conflicting requirements to obtain accurate redshift information and large
statistics. We present cosmological results from the full 5000 sq. deg. of the
Dark Energy Survey first three years of observations (Y3) combining those
two-point functions, using for the first time a magnitude-limited lens sample
(MagLim) of 11 million galaxies especially selected to optimize such
combination, and 100 million background shapes. We consider two cosmological
models, flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM. In $\Lambda$CDM we obtain for the matter
density $\Omega_m = 0.320^{+0.041}_{-0.034}$ and for the clustering amplitude
$S_8 = 0.778^{+0.037}_{-0.031}$, at 68% C.L. The latter is only 1$\sigma$
smaller than the prediction in this model informed by measurements of the
cosmic microwave background by the Planck satellite. In $w$CDM we find
$\Omega_m = 0.32^{+0.044}_{-0.046}$, $S_8=0.777^{+0.049}_{-0.051}$, and dark
energy equation of state $w=-1.031^{+0.218}_{-0.379}$. We find that including
smaller scales while marginalizing over non-linear galaxy bias improves the
constraining power in the $\Omega_m-S_8$ plane by $31$% and in the $\Omega_m-w$
plane by $41$% while yielding consistent cosmological parameters from those in
the linear bias case. These results are combined with those from cosmic shear
in a companion paper to present full DES-Y3 constraints from the three
two-point functions (3x2pt).

100 million source galaxies, (ii) galaxy clustering, and (iii) the
cross-correlation of source galaxy shear with lens galaxy positions. The
analysis was designed to mitigate confirmation or observer bias; we describe
specific changes made to the lens galaxy sample following unblinding of the

models. We find consistent cosmological results between the three two-point

recount and illustrate key concepts of geometric control theory in the context
of multiple particles in Stokesian fluids interacting with each other, such
that they may be readily and widely applied in this largely unexplored
fluid-dynamical setting. Motivated both by experimental and abstract questions
of control, we exemplify these techniques by explicit and detailed application
to multiple problems concerning the control of particles, such as the motion of
tracers in flow and the guidance of one sphere by another. Further, we showcase
how this analysis of controllability can directly lead to the construction of
schemes for control, in addition to facilitating explorations of mechanical
efficiency and contributing to our overall understanding of non-local
hydrodynamic interactions in the Stokes limit.

intractable to compute the necessary control parameter values of a
droplet-generating device that produces optimized droplets. Furthermore, as the
length scale of the fluid flow changes, the formation physics and optimized

single proportional integral derivative controller is too inflexible to
optimize devices of different length scales or different control parameters,
while classification machine learning techniques take days to train and require
millions of droplet images. Therefore, the question is posed, can a single

using only a few data points and is faster than previous approaches? In this
paper, a Bayesian optimization and computer vision feedback loop is designed to
quickly and reliably discover the control parameter values that generate
optimized droplets within different length-scale devices. This method is
demonstrated to converge on optimum parameter values using 60 images in only

reconnection has remained a fundamental topic in the plasma universe, not only
in the Earth's magnetosphere but in astrophysical objects such as pulsar

nonthermal particle acceleration and plasma heating during reconnection have
been extensively studied, and it has been argued that rapid energy dissipation
can occur for a collisionless ""thin"" current sheet, the thickness of which is
of the order of the particle gyro-radius. However, it is an intriguing enigma
as to how the fast energy dissipation can occur for a ""thick"" current sheet
with thickness larger than the particle gyro-radius. Here we demonstrate, using
a high-resolution particle-in-cell simulation for a pair plasma, that an
explosive reconnection can emerge with the enhancement of the inertia
resistivity due to the magnetization of the meandering particles by the
reconnecting magnetic field and the shrinkage of the current sheet. In
addition, regardless of the initial thickness of the current sheet, the time
scale of the nonlinear explosive reconnection is tens of the Alfv\'{e}n transit
time.

attractive due to their potential role in studying various fundamental problems

achieve efficient measurements of oscillator motion, while this remains a
challenge. Here we theoretically propose a lens-free optical detection scheme,
which can be used to detect the motion of a millimeter or sub-millimeter
levitated oscillator with a measurement efficiency close to the standard
quantum limit with a modest optical power. We demonstrate experimentally this
scheme on a 0.5 mm diameter micro-sphere that is diamagnetically levitated
under high vacuum and room temperature, and the thermal motion is detected with
high precision. Based on this system, an estimated acceleration sensitivity of
$9.7 \times 10^{-10}\rm g/\sqrt{Hz}$ is achieved, which is more than one order
improvement over the best value reported by the levitated mechanical system.
Due to the stability of the system, the minimum resolved acceleration of
$3.5\times 10^{-12}\rm g$ is reached with measurement times of $10^5$ s. This
result is expected to have potential applications in the study of exotic
interactions in the millimeter or sub-millimeter range and the realization of

  Optimization Approach",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In e-commerce platforms, sponsored and non-sponsored content are jointly
displayed to users and both may interactively influence their engagement
behavior. The former content helps advertisers achieve their marketing goals
and provides a stream of ad revenue to the platform. The latter content
contributes to users' engagement with the platform, which is key to its
long-term health. A burning issue for e-commerce platform design is how to
blend advertising with content in a way that respects these interactions and
balances these multiple business objectives. This paper describes a system
developed for this purpose in the context of blending personalized sponsored
content with non-sponsored content on the product detail pages of JD.COM, an
e-commerce company. This system has three key features: (1) Optimization of
multiple competing business objectives through a new virtual bids approach and
the expressiveness of the latent, implicit valuation of the platform for the
multiple objectives via these virtual bids. (2) Modeling of users' click
behavior as a function of their characteristics, the individual characteristics
of each sponsored content and the influence exerted by other sponsored and
non-sponsored content displayed alongside through a deep learning approach; (3)
Consideration of externalities in the allocation of ads, thereby making it
directly compatible with a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction scheme for the
computation of payments in the presence of these externalities. The system is
currently deployed and serving all traffic through JD.COM's mobile application.
Experiments demonstrating the performance and advantages of the system are
presented.

applications such as photonic spin-Hall effects and spin-dependent vortex

theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that airborne sound can possess
artificial transversality in an acoustic micropolar metamaterial and thus carry
both spin and orbital angular momentum. This enables the realization of
acoustic SOIs with rich phenomena beyond those in conventional acoustic
systems. We demonstrate that acoustic activity of the metamaterial can induce
coupling between the spin and linear crystal momentum k, which leads to
negative refraction of the transverse sound. In addition, we show that the
scattering of the transverse sound by a dipole particle can generate
spin-dependent acoustic vortices via the geometric phase effect. The acoustic
SOIs can provide new perspectives and functionalities for sound manipulations
beyond the conventional scalar degree of freedom and may open an avenue to the
development of spin-orbit acoustics.

exponential of finite truncations of the true rate matrix -- and then to use

we can dramatically increase the efficiency of this approach by avoiding the

methodology for constructing an unbiased, non-negative estimate of the

develop a novel approximation in this family -- the skeletoid -- as well as
theory regarding its approximation error and how that relates to the variance

that our approach yields more efficient posterior inference for a wide variety

  Quantification of Sea Ice Floes",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.DS physics.comp-ph physics.data-an","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The discrete element method (DEM) is providing a new modeling approach for
describing sea ice dynamics. It exploits particle-based methods to characterize
the physical quantities of each sea ice floe along its trajectory under
Lagrangian coordinates. One major challenge in applying the DEM models is the
heavy computational cost when the number of floes becomes large. In this paper,
an efficient Lagrangian parameterization algorithm is developed, which aims at
reducing the computational cost of simulating the DEM models while preserving
the key features of the sea ice. The new parameterization takes advantage of a
small number of artificial ice floes, named the superfloes, to effectively
approximate a considerable number of the floes, where the parameterization
scheme satisfies several important physics constraints. The physics constraints
guarantee the superfloe parameterized system will have similar short-term
dynamical behavior as the full system. These constraints also allow the
superfloe parameterized system to accurately quantify the long-range
uncertainty, especially the non-Gaussian statistical features, of the full
system. In addition, the superfloe parameterization facilitates a systematic
noise inflation strategy that significantly advances an ensemble-based data
assimilation algorithm for recovering the unobserved ocean field underneath the
sea ice. Such a new noise inflation method avoids ad hoc tunings as in many
traditional algorithms and is computationally extremely efficient. Numerical
experiments based on an idealized DEM model with multiscale features illustrate
the success of the superfloe parameterization in quantifying the uncertainty
and assimilating both the sea ice and the associated ocean field.

most abundant and diverse biological entities in the biosphere. To understand
their regulatory roles in various ecosystems and to harness the potential of
bacteriophages for use in therapy, more knowledge of viral-host relationships
is required. High-throughput sequencing and its application to the microbiome
have offered new opportunities for computational approaches for predicting
which hosts particular viruses can infect. However, there are two main
challenges for computational host prediction. First, the empirically known
virus-host relationships are very limited. Second, although sequence similarity
between viruses and their prokaryote hosts have been used as a major feature
for host prediction, the alignment is either missing or ambiguous in many
cases. Thus, there is still a need to improve the accuracy of host prediction.
Results: In this work, we present a semi-supervised learning model, named
HostG, to conduct host prediction for novel viruses. We construct a knowledge
graph by utilizing both virus-virus protein similarity and virus-host DNA
sequence similarity. Then graph convolutional network (GCN) is adopted to
exploit viruses with or without known hosts in training to enhance the learning
ability. During the GCN training, we minimize the expected calibrated error
(ECE) to ensure the confidence of the predictions. We tested HostG on both
simulated and real sequencing data and compared its performance with other
state-of-the-art methods specifcally designed for virus host classification
(VHM-net, WIsH, PHP, HoPhage, RaFAH, vHULK, and VPF-Class). Conclusion: HostG
outperforms other popular methods, demonstrating the efficacy of using a
GCN-based semi-supervised learning approach. A particular advantage of HostG is
its ability to predict hosts from new taxa.

general FIOs (under the usual clean-intersection hypothesis). The simplest
examples of isotropic states are the ""coherent states"", a class of oscillatory

red giant via asteroseismology. An extension of these aims is to determine a
dynamical mass and an age prior for a $\delta$ Sct star, which may permit mode
identification via further asteroseismic modelling. We determine spectroscopic
parameters and radial velocities (RVs) for the red giant component using
HERMES@Mercator spectroscopy. Light arrival-time delays from the $\delta$ Sct
pulsations are used with the red-giant RVs to determine that the system is
bound and to infer its orbital parameters, including the binary mass ratio. We
use asteroseismology to model the individual frequencies of the red giant to
give a mass of $2.10^{+0.20}_{-0.10}$ M$_{\odot}$ and an age of
$1.08^{+0.06}_{-0.24}$ Gyr. We find that it is a helium-burning secondary clump
star, confirm that it follows the standard $\nu_{\rm max}$ scaling relation,
and confirm its observed period spacings match their theoretical counterparts
in the modelling code MESA. Our results also constrain the mass and age of the
$\delta$ Sct star. We leverage these constraints to construct $\delta$ Sct
models in a reduced parameter space and identify four of its five pulsation
modes.

microphysics-agnostic predictions of long-term glitch statistics, which can be
falsified by existing and future timing data. Previous meta-models assume that
glitches are triggered by an avalanche process, e.g. involving superfluid
vortices, and that the probability density function (PDF) of the avalanche
sizes is history-independent and specified exogenously. Here a recipe is
proposed to generate the avalanche sizes endogenously in a history-dependent
manner, by tracking the thresholds of occupied vortex pinning sites as a
function of time. Vortices unpin spasmodically from sites with thresholds below
a global, time-dependent stress and repin at sites with thresholds above the
global stress, imbuing the system with long-term memory. The meta-model
predicts PDFs, auto- and cross-correlations for glitch sizes and waiting times,
which are provisionally inconsistent with current observations, unlike some
previous meta-models (e.g. state dependent Poisson process), whose predictions
are consistent. The theoretical implications are intriguing, albeit uncertain,
because history-dependent avalanches embody faithfully the popular, idealized
understanding in the literature of how vortex unpinning operates as a driven,
stochastic process. The meta-model predicts aftershocks, which occur with
larger than average sizes and longer than average waiting times after the
largest, system-resetting glitches. This prediction will be tested, once more
data are generated by the next generation of pulsar timing campaigns.

intelligent transportation systems. Most previous works model the road segments
or intersections separately by learning their spatio-temporal characteristics
to estimate travel time. However, due to the continuous alternations of the
road segments and intersections in a path, the dynamic features are supposed to
be coupled and interactive. Therefore, modeling one of them limits further
improvement in accuracy of estimating travel time. To address the above
problems, a novel graph-based deep learning framework for travel time
estimation is proposed in this paper, namely Spatio-Temporal Dual Graph Neural
Networks (STDGNN). Specifically, we first establish the node-wise and edge-wise
graphs to respectively characterize the adjacency relations of intersections
and that of road segments. In order to extract the joint spatio-temporal
correlations of the intersections and road segments, we adopt the
spatio-temporal dual graph learning approach that incorporates multiple
spatial-temporal dual graph learning modules with multi-scale network
architectures for capturing multi-level spatial-temporal information from the
dual graph. Finally, we employ the multi-task learning approach to estimate the
travel time of a given whole route, each road segment and intersection
simultaneously. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed model
on three real-world trajectory datasets, and the experimental results show that
STDGNN significantly outperforms several state-of-art baselines.

eliminate abnormal ones. A novel Region Attention loss to make the network

Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms other semi-supervised

behaviors of plectoneme, e.g. diffusion, nucleation and hopping. To represent
these dynamics with computational changes, we demonstrated first the fast
dynamics on the DNA to reach torque equilibrium within the P and S phases, and
then identified the two-phase boundaries as collective slow variables to
describe the essential dynamics. According to the time scale separation
demonstrated here, we accordingly developed a two-phase model on the dynamics
of DNA supercoiling, which can capture physiologically relevant events across
time scales of several orders of magnitudes. In this model, we systematically
characterized the slow dynamics between the two phases, and compared the
numerical results with that from the DNA polymer physics-based worm-like chain
model. The supercoiling dynamics, including the nucleation, diffusion, and
hopping of plectoneme, have been well represented and reproduced, using the

10.1109/TMECH.2021.3100150. Ideally, accurate sensor measurements are needed to
achieve a good performance in the closed-loop control of mechatronic systems.
As a consequence, sensor faults will prevent the system from working correctly,
unless a fault-tolerant control (FTC) architecture is adopted. As model-based
FTC algorithms for nonlinear systems are often challenging to design, this
paper focuses on a new method for FTC in the presence of sensor faults, based
on deep learning. The considered approach replaces the phases of fault
detection and isolation and controller design with a single recurrent neural
network, which has the value of past sensor measurements in a given time window
as input, and the current values of the control variables as output. This
end-to-end deep FTC method is applied to a mechatronic system composed of a
spherical inverted pendulum, whose configuration is changed via reaction
wheels, in turn actuated by electric motors. The simulation and experimental
results show that the proposed method can handle abrupt faults occurring in
link position/velocity sensors. The provided supplementary material includes a
video of real-world experiments and the software source code.

cloud-based applications by bringing computing resources, at least in part,
closer to the user. Reasons include the increasing need for real-time
(short-delay, reliably-connected) computing and resource-demanding artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms that overstrain mobile devices' batteries or
compute power but are too bandwidth-demanding to be offloaded to a distant
cloud. However, companies may need to run their protected business logic on

weaker security measures than in cloud environments. This article makes the
case for trusted edge computing (TEC), which focuses on developing concepts and
methods for protecting application providers' business logic (and thus their
intellectual property) specifically tailored to open edge infrastructures. This
article further discusses open challenges in TEC to be addressed in the future.

Precisely, we study the Cauchy problems of these two classical collisional
kinetic equations around global Maxwellians in torus and establish the
following results that are uniform in the vanishing grazing parameter
$\epsilon$: (i) spectral gap type estimates for the collision operators; (ii)
global existence of small-amplitude solutions for initial data with low

techniques that blindly incorporate all samples, our method dynamically selects
a subset of augmented samples that maximizes KL-divergence between the teacher

ensure our augmented data covers regions in the input space with maximum loss

provides applications that outperform their known classical counterparts.
However, millions of interacting qubits with stringent criteria are required,
which is intractable with current quantum technologies. As it would take
decades to make it happen, exploiting the power of noisy intermediate-scale
quantum(NISQ) devices, which already exist, is becoming one of current goals.
Matrix exponentiation, especially hermitian matrix exponentiation, is an
essential element for quantum information processing. In this article, a
heuristic method is reported as simulating a hermitian matrix exponentiation
using parametrized quantum circuit(PQC). To generate PQCs for simulations, two
strategies, each with its own advantages, are proposed, and can be deployed on
near future quantum devices. Compared with the method such as product formula
and density matrix exponentiation, the PQCs provided in our method require only
low depth circuit and easily accessible gates, which benefit experimental
realizations. Furthermore, in this paper, an ancilla-assisted parameterized
quantum circuit is proposed to characterize and compress a unitary process,
which is likely to be applicable to realizing applications on NISQ hardwares,
such as phase estimation, principal component analyses, and matrix inversion.
To support the feasibility of our method, numerical experiments were
investigated via simulating evolutions by Bell state, GHZ state and Hamiltonian
of Crotonic acid, which show an experimental friendly result when compared with
their conventional methods. As pursuing a fault-tolerant quantum computer is
still challenging and takes decades, our work, which gives a NISQ device
friendly way, contributes to the field of NISQ algorithms and provides a
possibility, exploiting the power with current quantum technology.

Stellar spectral synthesis is essential for various applications,
ranging from determining stellar parameters to comprehensive stellar

stellar atmosphere modelling, taking three dimensional (3D) effects from
radiative magnetohydrodynamics calculations into account, require a more
efficient radiative transfer.
  Aims. For accurate, fast and flexible calculations of opacity distribution
functions (ODFs), stellar atmospheres and stellar spectra we developed an
efficient code building on the well-established ATLAS9 code. The new code also
paves the way for an easy and fast access to different elemental compositions
in stellar calculations.
  Methods. For the generation of ODF tables we further developed the
well-established DFSYNTHE code by implementing additional functionality, and a
speed-up by employing a parallel computation scheme. In addition, the line
lists used can be changed from Kurucz's recent lists. In particular, we
implemented the VALD3 line list.
  Results. A new code, the Merged Parallelised Simplified ATLAS is presented.
It combines the efficient generation of ODF, atmosphere modelling and spectral
synthesis in local thermodynamic equilibrium, therefore being an all-in-one
code. This all-in-one code provides more numerical functionality and is
substantially faster compared to other available codes. The fully portable
MPS-ATLAS code is validated against previous ATLAS9 calculations, the PHOENIX

gravitational wave emission drives the orbital decay. However, we can not find
an allowable solution to the secondary that satisfies simultaneously the three
constraints: an ultra-tight orbit, the bright absolute magnitude, and the large
amplitude of the brightness variation. Moreover, the inferred mass transfer
rate is too high. This scenario is therefore ruled out. We then find the system
is fully consistent with an ""intermediate polar"" model, in which the optical

low-mass (<~ 0.7 M_sun) main-sequence secondary. The observed period decay is
the accretion-driven spin-up of the WD. The WD spin period is 12.8 min and the

processes the remaining layers of the DNN. By adapting the model splitting
decision, there exists a tradeoff between local computation cost and
communication overhead. In practice, the DNN model is re-trained and updated
periodically at the edge server. Once the DNN parameters are regenerated, part
of the updated model must be placed at the WD to facilitate on-device
inference. In this paper, we study the joint optimization of the model
placement and online model splitting decisions to minimize the energy-and-time
cost of device-edge co-inference in presence of wireless channel fading. The
problem is challenging because the model placement and model splitting
decisions are strongly coupled, while involving two different time scales. We
first tackle online model splitting by formulating an optimal stopping problem,
where the finite horizon of the problem is determined by the model placement
decision. In addition to deriving the optimal model splitting rule based on
backward induction, we further investigate a simple one-stage look-ahead rule,

clinical recognition of ECG. Considering the fact that hospitals generally
record ECG signals in the form of graphic waves of 2-D images, we first extract
the graphic waves of 12-lead images into numerical 1-D ECG signals by a
proposed bi-directional connectivity method. Subsequently, a novel deep neural
network, namely CRT-Net, is designed for the fine-grained and comprehensive
representation and recognition of 1-D ECG signals. The CRT-Net can well explore
waveform features, morphological characteristics and time domain features of
ECG by embedding convolution neural network(CNN), recurrent neural

especially suitable in clinical scenarios with different lengths of ECG signals
captured from different devices. The proposed framework is first evaluated on
two widely investigated public repositories, demonstrating the superior

salutary for building recommender systems. However, accurately estimating the
post-click conversion rate (CVR) is challenging due to the selection bias,
i.e., the observed clicked events usually happen on users' preferred items.
Currently, most existing methods utilize counterfactual learning to debias
recommender systems. Among them, the doubly robust (DR) estimator has achieved
competitive performance by combining the error imputation based (EIB) estimator
and the inverse propensity score (IPS) estimator in a doubly robust way.
However, inaccurate error imputation may result in its higher variance than the
IPS estimator. Worse still, existing methods typically use simple
model-agnostic methods to estimate the imputation error, which are not
sufficient to approximate the dynamically changing model-correlated target
(i.e., the gradient direction of the prediction model). To solve these
problems, we first derive the bias and variance of the DR estimator. Based on
it, a more robust doubly robust (MRDR) estimator has been proposed to further
reduce its variance while retaining its double robustness. Moreover, we propose
a novel double learning approach for the MRDR estimator, which can convert the
error imputation into the general CVR estimation. Besides, we empirically
verify that the proposed learning scheme can further eliminate the high
variance problem of the imputation learning. To evaluate its effectiveness,
extensive experiments are conducted on a semi-synthetic dataset and two

the structure of launching regions of blazar jets should influence their large

jet variability, measured e.g. by its minimum variability time scale, and the
Lorentz factor, that spans several orders of magnitude and covers both blazars

projected into a space of finite dimension, associated to a functional basis.
We use Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) to represent the functions,
considering then the basis associated to the reproducing kernel. Using a simple
decision rule, we classify the points on the projected space among those
belonging to the minimum entropy set and those that do not. We push back the
minimum entropy set to the functional space and construct a band using the
regularity property of the RKHS. The proposed methodology is illustrated
through artificial and real-world data sets.

for solar radio spikes and has been investigated extensively since the 1980s.
Most studies relevant to solar spikes employ a loss-cone-type distribution of
energetic electrons, generating waves mainly in the fundamental X/O mode
(X1/O1), with a ratio of plasma oscillation frequency to electron gyrofrequency
(${\omega}_ {pe}/{\Omega}_{ce}$) lower than 1. Despite the great progress made
in this theory, one major problem is how the fundamental emissions pass through
the second-harmonic absorption layer in the corona and escape. This is
generally known as the escaping difficulty of the theory. Aims. We study the
harmonic emissions generated by ECME driven by energetic electrons with the
horseshoe distribution to solve the escaping difficulty of ECME for solar
spikes. Methods. We performed a fully kinetic electromagnetic PIC simulation
with ${\omega}_ {pe}/{\Omega}_{ce}$ = 0.1, corresponding to the strongly
magnetized plasma conditions in the flare region, with energetic electrons
characterized by the horseshoe distribution. We also varied the density ratio
of energetic electrons to total electrons ($n_e/n_0$) in the simulation.
Results. We obtain efficient amplification of waves in Z and X2 modes, with a
relatively weak growth of O1 and X3. With a higher-density ratio, the X2
emission becomes more intense, and the rate of energy conversion from energetic
electrons into X2 modes can reach $\sim$0.06% and 0.17%, with $n_e/n_0$= 5% and
10%, respectively. Conclusions. We find that the horseshoe-driven ECME can lead
to an efficient excitation of X2 and X3 with a low value of ${\omega}_
{pe}/{\Omega}_{ce}$, providing novel means for resolving the escaping
difficulty of ECME when applied to solar radio spikes. The simultaneous growth
of X2 and X3 can be used to explain some harmonic structures observed in solar
spikes.

probability ratio test (MSPRT) is known to be asymptotically optimal for this

applications; the MSPRT requires the underlying probability density. To address
this problem, we propose to solve density ratio matrix estimation (DRME), a
novel type of density ratio estimation that consists of estimating matrices of
multiple density ratios with constraints and thus is more challenging than the
conventional density ratio estimation. We propose a log-sum-exp-type loss

the true density ratio matrix as the sample size of the training set increases

possible NSBH events so far, we use two of them to place the constraints. The
other two are excluded in this work due to the possible unphysical deviations.
We consider the inspiral range with the cutoff frequency at the innermost

derived by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for different

nonnegative input matrix $V$ and a factorization rank $K$, compute two
nonnegative matrices, $W$ with $K$ columns and $H$ with $K$ rows, such that
$WH$ approximates $V$ as well as possible. In this paper, we propose two new
approaches for computing high-quality NMF solutions using conic optimization.
These approaches rely on the same two steps. First, we reformulate NMF as
minimizing a concave function over a product of convex cones--one approach is
based on the exponential cone, and the other on the second-order cone. Then, we
solve these reformulations iteratively: at each step, we minimize exactly, over
the feasible set, a majorization of the objective functions obtained via
linearization at the current iterate. Hence these subproblems are convex conic
programs and can be solved efficiently using dedicated algorithms. We prove
that our approaches reach a stationary point with an accuracy decreasing as
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{i})$, where $i$ denotes the iteration number. To the best
of our knowledge, our analysis is the first to provide a convergence rate to
stationary points for NMF. Furthermore, in the particular cases of rank-one
factorizations (that is, $K=1$), we show that one of our formulations can be
expressed as a convex optimization problem implying that optimal rank-one
approximations can be computed efficiently. Finally, we show on several
numerical examples that our approaches are able to frequently compute exact
NMFs (that is, with $V = WH$), and compete favorably with the state of the art.

better use the limited available cross-lingual resources. Existing methods to
do so often adopt sequence-to-sequence networks with multi-task frameworks.
Such approaches apply multiple decoders, each of which is utilized for a
specific task. However, these independent decoders share no parameters, hence
fail to capture the relationships between the discrete phrases of summaries in
different languages, breaking the connections in order to transfer the
knowledge of the high-resource languages to low-resource languages. To bridge
these connections, we propose a novel Multi-Task framework for Cross-Lingual
Abstractive Summarization (MCLAS) in a low-resource setting. Employing one
unified decoder to generate the sequential concatenation of monolingual and
cross-lingual summaries, MCLAS makes the monolingual summarization task a
prerequisite of the cross-lingual summarization (CLS) task. In this way, the
shared decoder learns interactions involving alignments and summary patterns
across languages, which encourages attaining knowledge transfer. Experiments on
two CLS datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms three
baseline models in both low-resource and full-dataset scenarios. Moreover,
in-depth analysis on the generated summaries and attention heads verifies that
interactions are learned well using MCLAS, which benefits the CLS task under

computer systems. In order to create these networks, engineers typically
specify a desired topology, and then use an automated training algorithm to
select the network's weights. While training algorithms have been studied
extensively and are well understood, the selection of topology remains a form
of art, and can often result in networks that are unnecessarily large - and
consequently are incompatible with end devices that have limited memory,

harnessing recent advances in DNN verification. We present a framework and a
methodology for discovering redundancies in DNNs - i.e., for finding neurons
that are not needed, and can be removed in order to reduce the size of the DNN.
By using sound verification techniques, we can formally guarantee that our
simplified network is equivalent to the original, either completely, or up to a
prescribed tolerance. Further, we show how to combine our technique with
slicing, which results in a family of very small DNNs, which are together
equivalent to the original. Our approach can produce DNNs that are
significantly smaller than the original, rendering them suitable for deployment
on additional kinds of systems, and even more amenable to subsequent formal
verification. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of our approach, and
use it to evaluate our techniques on several real-world DNNs.

origin of its enormous spin axial tilt (~98^o). A giant impact between
proto-Uranus and a 2-3 M_Earth impactor could lead to a large tilt and to the
formation of an impact generated disc, where prograde and circular satellites
are accreted. The most intriguing features of the current regular Uranian
satellite system is that it possesses a positive trend in the mass-distance
distribution and likely also in the bulk density, implying that viscous
spreading of the disc after the giant impact plays a crucial role in shaping
the architecture of the final system. In this paper, we investigate the
formation of Uranus' satellites by combining results of SPH simulations for the
giant impact, a 1D semi-analytic disc model for viscous spreading of the
post-impact disc, and N-body simulations for the assembly of satellites from a
disc of moonlets. Assuming the condensed rock (i.e., silicate) remains small
and available to stick onto the relatively rapid growing condensed water-ice,
we find that the best case in reproducing the observed mass and bulk
composition of Uranus' satellite system is a pure-rocky impactor with 3 M_Earth
colliding with the young Uranus with an impact parameter b = 0.75. Such an
oblique collision could also naturally explain Uranus' large tilt and possibly,
its low internal heat flux. The giant impact scenario can naturally explain the
key features of Uranus and its regular moons. We therefore suggest that the
Uranian satellite system formed as a result of an impact rather than from a
circumplanetary disc.

of optimization variables. The computational complexity of an exhaustive search
over all possible subsets of variables is, however, prohibitively expensive,
necessitating more efficient but potentially suboptimal search strategies. We
focus on sparse variable selection for generalized Rayleigh quotient
optimization and generalized eigenvalue problems. Such problems often arise in
the signal processing field, e.g., in the design of optimal data-driven
filters. We extend and generalize existing work on convex optimization-based
variable selection using semidefinite relaxations toward group-sparse variable
selection using the $\ell_{1,\infty}$-norm. This group-sparsity allows, for
instance, to perform sensor selection for spatio-temporal (instead of purely
spatial) filters, and to select variables based on multiple generalized
eigenvectors instead of only the dominant one. Furthermore, we extensively
compare our method to state-of-the-art methods for sensor selection for
spatio-temporal filter design in a simulated sensor network setting. The
results show both the proposed algorithm and backward greedy selection method
best approximate the exhaustive solution. However, the backward greedy
selection has more specific failure cases, in particular for ill-conditioned
covariance matrices. As such, the proposed algorithm is the most robust
currently available method for group-sparse variable selection in generalized
eigenvalue problems.

fractional diffusive models from a numerical analysis and simulation
perspective. We do this by surveying several research results we obtained in
the last years, focusing in particular on the numerical computation of
controls. Our reference model will be a non-local diffusive dynamics driven by
the fractional Laplacian on a bounded domain $\Omega$. The starting point of
our analysis will be a Finite Element approximation for the associated elliptic
model in one and two space-dimensions, for which we also present error
estimates and convergence rates in the $L^2$ and energy norm. Secondly, we will
address two specific control scenarios: firstly, we consider the standard
interior control problem, in which the control is acting from a small subset
$\omega\subset\Omega$. Secondly, we move our attention to the exterior control
problem, in which the control region $\mathcal O\subset\Omega^c$ is located
outside $\Omega$. This exterior control notion extends boundary control to the
fractional framework, in which the non-local nature of the models does not
allow for controls supported on $\partial\Omega$. We will conclude by
discussing the interesting problem of simultaneous control, in which we
consider families of parameter-dependent fractional heat equations and we aim
at designing a unique control function capable of steering all the different
realizations of the model to the same target configuration. In this framework,
we will see how the employment of stochastic optimization techniques may help
in alleviating the computational burden for the approximation of simultaneous
controls. Our discussion is complemented by several open problems related with
fractional models which are currently unsolved and may be of interest for
future investigation.

($P\sim$5.6%) and red optical-IR ($g-W_4$ = 12.35) colors suggest that Mrk 1239
is more similar to type-2 active galactic nuclei like NGC 1068. Detailed
analysis of spectral energy distribution in the UV-optical-IR yields two
components from the nucleus: a direct and transmitted component that is heavily
obscured ($E_{B-V} \approx 1.6$), and another indirect and scattered one with
mild extinction ($E_{B-V} \sim$ 0.5). Such a two-light-paths scenario is also
found in previous reports based on the X-ray data. Comparison of emission lines
and the detection of He\,{\footnotesize I}*$\lambda$10830 BAL at [-3000,-1000]
km s$^{-1}$ indicates that the obscuring clouds are at physical scale between
the sublimation radius and that of the narrow emission line regions. The
potential existence of powerful outflows is found as both the obscurer and
scatterer are outflowing. Similar to many other type-2s, jet-like structure in
the radio band is found in Mrk 1239, perpendicular to the polarization angle,
suggesting polar scattering. We argue that Mrk 1239 is very probably a type-2
counterpart of NLS1s. The identification of 1 out of 8 prototype NLS1s as a
type-2 counterpart implies that there can be a substantial amount of analogs of
Mrk 1239 misidentified as type-1s in the optical band. Properties of these
misidentified objects are going to be explored in our future works.

thermally-induced degradation processes in a set of CIGSe-based solar cells

atom probe tomography (APT)/transmission electron microscope (TEM), we found
that the buffer-absorber interface is not sharp but consists of an interfacial
zone (2 - 6.5 nm wide) where a gradient of constituent elements belonging to
the CdS buffer and CIGSe absorber appears. An enhanced short-range Cd
in-diffusion inside the CIGSe was observed whenever a low Ga/(Ga+In) ratio
occurred at the interface. This might indicate the presence of Ga vacancies as
a channeling defect for Cd in-diffusion inside the CIGSe layer leading to a
buried pn-homojunction. We evidence that a considerable amount of Cd is found
inside the CIGSe layer at annealing temperatures higher than 150C. Further
investigations of the elemental redistribution inside the CIGSe layer combined
with C-V measurements support the formation of CdCu donor like defects deep
inside the p-type CIGSe which lead to a strong compensation of the CIGSe layer

(1) A memory-efficient multi-head self-attention is built, which compresses the
memory by a simple depth-wise convolution, and projects the interaction across
the attention-heads dimension while keeping the diversity ability of
multi-heads; (2) Position encoding is constructed as spatial attention, which
is more flexible and can tackle with input images of arbitrary size without
interpolation or fine-tune; (3) Instead of the straightforward tokenization at
the beginning of each stage, we design the patch embedding as a stack of

comprehensively validate ResT on image classification and downstream tasks.

overall structure and deriving parametric curves through post-processing.
Complex lane line shapes require high-dimensional output of CNNs to model
global structures, which further increases the demand for model capacity and
training data. In contrast, the locality of a lane marker has finite geometric
variations and spatial coverage. We propose a novel lane marker detection
solution, FOLOLane, that focuses on modeling local patterns and achieving
prediction of global structures in a bottom-up manner. Specifically, the CNN
models lowcomplexity local patterns with two separate heads, the first one
predicts the existence of key points, and the second refines the location of
key points in the local range and correlates key points of the same lane line.
The locality of the task is consistent with the limited FOV of the feature in
CNN, which in turn leads to more stable training and better generalization. In
addition, an efficiency-oriented decoding algorithm was proposed as well as a
greedy one, which achieving 36% runtime gains at the cost of negligible
performance degradation. Both of the two decoders integrated local information
into the global geometry of lane markers. In the absence of a complex network
architecture design, the proposed method greatly outperforms all existing
methods on public datasets while achieving the best state-of-the-art results

quantitatively examine this argument, we need to calculate the field scattered

considers extensions of timed automata. One extension that has received a lot
of interest is timed automata with a, possibly unbounded, stack, also called
the pushdown timed automata (PDTA) model. While different algorithms have been
given for reachability in different variants of this model, most of these
results are purely theoretical and do not give rise to efficient
implementations. One main reason for this is that none of these algorithms (and
the implementations that exist) use the so-called zone-based abstraction, but
rely either on the region-abstraction or other approaches, which are
significantly harder to implement.
  In this paper, we show that a naive extension of the zone based reachability
algorithm for the control state reachability problem of timed automata is not
sound in the presence of a stack. To understand this better we give an
inductive rule based view of the zone reachability algorithm for timed
automata. This alternate view allows us to analyze and adapt the rules to also
work for pushdown timed automata. We obtain the first zone-based algorithm for

a sub sample of KMOS redshift one spectroscopic survey (KROSS) previously
studied by \citet{GS20}. The stellar masses ($M_*$) of these objects were
previously estimated using mass-to-light ratios derived from fitting the
spectral energy distribution of the galaxies. Star formation rates were derived
from the H$_\alpha$ luminosities. The total gas masses ($M_{gas}$) are
determined by scaling relations of molecular and atomic gas
\citep[][respectively] {Tacconi2018, Lagos2011}. The dynamical masses
($M_{dyn}$) are directly derived from the rotation curves (RCs) at different
scale lengths (effective radius: $R_e$, $\sim 2 \ R_e$ and $\sim 3 \ R_e$) and
then the dark matter fractions ($f_{ DM }=1-M_{bar}/M_{dyn}$) at these radii
are calculated. We report that at $z\sim 1$ only a small fraction ($\sim 5\%$)
of our sample has a low ($< 20\%$) DM fraction within $\sim$ 2-3 $R_e$. The
majority ($> 72\%$) of SFGs in our sample have dark matter dominated outer
disks ($\sim 5-10$ kpc) in agreement with local SFGs. Moreover, we find a large
scatter in the fraction of dark matter at a given stellar mass (or circular
velocity) with respect to local SFGs, suggesting that galaxies at $z \sim 1$,
a) span a wide range of stages in the formation of stellar disks, b) have
diverse DM halo properties coupled with baryons.

ratios $\Gamma$, the ratio of the particle density and fluid density, ranging
from $0.37$ up to $0.97$. At each $\Gamma$ the MOI was varied by shifting mass
between the shell and the center of the particle to vary $I^*$ (the particle
MOI normalised by the MOI of particle with the same weight and a uniform mass
distribution). Helical paths are observed for low, and `3D chaotic'
trajectories at higher values of $\Gamma$. The present data suggests no
influence of $I^*$ on the critical value for this transition
$0.42<\Gamma_{\textrm{crit}}<0.52$. For the `3D chaotic' rise mode we identify
trends of decreasing particle drag coefficient ($C_d$) and amplitude of
oscillation with increasing $I^*$. Due to limited data it remains unclear if a
similar dependence exists in the helical regime as well. Path oscillations
remain finite for all cases studied and no `rectilinear' mode is encountered,
which may be the consequence of allowing for a longer transient distance in the
present compared to earlier work. Rotational dynamics did not vary
significantly between quiescent and turbulent surroundings, indicating that
these are predominantly wake driven.

nonlinear differential equations and includes diffusion and advection terms for
modeling the dispersal of vegetation and biocrust and the effect of wind on
them. In the absence of spatial variability, the model exhibits self-sustained
relaxation oscillations and regimes of bistability--the first state is
dominated by biocrust and the second by vegetation. We concentrate on the
one-dimensional dynamics of the model and show that the front that connects
these two states propagates mainly due to the wind advection.
  In the oscillatory regime, the front propagation is complex. For low wind DP
(drift potential) values, a series of spatially oscillatory domains develops as
the front advances downwind. These domains form due to the oscillations of the
spatially homogeneous states away from the front. However, for higher DP
values, the dynamics is much more complex, becoming very sensitive to the
initial conditions and exhibiting an irregular spatial pattern as small domains
are created and annihilated during the front advance. Such irregular dynamics
can be associated with the temporal variations of dune cover. In addition,
similar behavior can be generated by other models that exhibit temporal
oscillations and bistability.

plasma non-uniformities are confidently observed in the Sun's corona.
Observations at large heights suggest that fast wave trains can travel long
distances from the excitation locations. We study characteristic time
signatures of fully developed, dispersive fast magnetoacoustic wave trains in
field-aligned zero-$\beta$ plasma slabs in the linear regime. Fast wave trains
are excited by a spatially localised impulsive driver and propagate along the
waveguide as prescribed by the waveguide-caused dispersion. In slabs with
steeper transverse density profiles, developed wave trains are shown to consist
of three distinct phases: a long-period quasi-periodic phase with the
oscillation period shortening with time, a multi-periodic (peloton) phase in
which distinctly different periods co-exist, and a short-lived periodic Airy
phase. The appearance of these phases is attributed to a non-monotonic
dependence of the fast wave group speed on the parallel wavenumber due to the
waveguide dispersion, and is shown to be different for axisymmetric (sausage)
and non-axisymmetric (kink) modes. In wavelet analysis, this corresponds to the
transition from the previously known tadpole shape to a new boomerang shape of
the wave train spectrum, with two well-pronounced arms at shorter and longer
periods. We describe a specific previously published radio observation of a
coronal fast wave train, highly suggestive of a change of the wavelet spectrum
from a tadpole to a boomerang, broadly consistent with our modelling. The
applicability of these boomerang-shaped fast wave trains for probing the
transverse structuring of the waveguiding coronal plasma is discussed.

the encrypted parameters, the accuracy of the DNN model drops significantly,
which can prevent malicious infringers from using the model. After the
encryption, the positions of encrypted parameters and the values of the added
adversarial perturbations form a secret key. Authorized user can use the secret
key to decrypt the model. Compared with the watermarking methods which only
passively verify the ownership after the infringement occurs, the proposed
method can prevent infringement in advance. Moreover, compared with most of the
existing active DNN IP protection methods, the proposed method does not require

overhead. Experimental results show that, after the encryption, the test
accuracy of the model drops by 80.65%, 81.16%, and 87.91% on Fashion-MNIST,

encrypted parameters of all the model's parameters is as low as 0.000205%. The

marginally-stable eigenmodes. The amplitude of each eigenmode is determined by
requiring that the background state maintains marginal stability. The
background temperature profile evolves due to the advective flux of every
marginally-stable eigenmode, as well as diffusion. To ensure marginal stability
and to obtain the eigenfunctions at every timestep, we perform a
one-dimensional eigenvalue solve on each of the allowable wavenumbers. The
background temperature field evolves to an equilibrium state, where the
advective flux from the marginally-stable eigenmodes and the diffusive flux sum
to a constant. These marginally-stable thermal equilibria (MSTE) are exact
solutions of the quasilinear equations. The mean temperature profile has
thinner boundary layers and larger Nusselt numbers than thermally-equilibrated
2D and 3D simulations of the full nonlinear equations. We find the Nusselt
number scales like $\rm{Nu} \sim\rm{Ra}^{1/3}$. When an MSTE is used as initial
conditions for a 2D simulation, we find that Nu quickly equilibrates without
the burst of turbulence often induced by purely conductive initial conditions,
but we also find that the kinetic energy is too large and viscously attenuates
on a long viscous time scale. This is due to the thin temperature boundary
layers which diffuse heat very effectively, thereby requiring high-velocity
advective flows to reach an equilibrium.

Analysis (PFA) introduces a powerful class of fault attacks that allows for a
fault to be present throughout the whole execution. One limitation of original
PFA as introduced by Zhang et al. at CHES'18 is that the faulty values need to
be known to the adversary. While this was addressed at a follow-up work at
CHES'20, the solution is only applicable to a single faulty value. Instead, we
use the potency of Statistical Fault Analysis (SFA) in the persistent fault
setting, presenting Statistical Persistent Fault Analysis (SPFA) as a more
general approach of PFA. As a result, any or even a multitude of unknown faults
that cause an exploitable bias in the targeted round can be used to recover the
cipher's secret key. Indeed, the undesired faults in the other rounds that
occur due the persistent nature of the attack converge to a uniform
distribution as required by SFA. We verify the effectiveness of our attack
against LED and AES.

external stimuli into internal signals, which are then decoded. The Bayesian
mean is an important decoder, as it is optimal for purposes of both estimation
and discrimination. We present widely-applicable approximations to the bias and
to the variance of the Bayesian mean, obtained under the minimal and
biologically-relevant assumption that the encoding results from a series of
independent, though not necessarily identically-distributed, signals.
Simulations substantiate the accuracy of our approximations in the small-noise
regime. The bias of the Bayesian mean comprises two components: one driven by
the prior, and one driven by the precision of the encoding. If the encoding is
'efficient', the two components have opposite effects; their relative strengths
are determined by the objective that the encoding optimizes. The experimental
literature on perception reports both 'Bayesian' biases directed towards prior
expectations, and opposite, 'anti-Bayesian' biases. We show that different
tasks are indeed predicted to yield such contradictory biases, under a
consistently-optimal encoding-decoding model. Moreover, we recover Wei and
Stocker's ""law of human perception"", a relation between the bias of the
Bayesian mean and the derivative of its variance, and show how the coefficient
of proportionality in this law depends on the task at hand. Our results provide
a parsimonious theory of optimal perception under constraints, in which
encoding and decoding are adapted both to the prior and to the task faced by
the observer.

signature of an exciton associated with that state is observed in the

the state does not originate from irradiation-induced structural defects or
spatially non-uniform strain, as commonly assumed. Instead, we show that it is
extrinsic, likely a charge transfer exciton associated with the organic

opens new possibilities for further understanding of these states and using

complexity from egg to adult. The successive differentiation of different cell
types, that elaborates this complexity, result from the activity of gene
networks and was likened by Waddington to a flow through a landscape in which
valleys represent alternative fates. Geometric methods allow the formal
representation of such landscapes and codify the types of behaviors that result
from systems of differential equations. Results from Smale and coworkers imply
that systems encompassing gene network models can be represented as potential
gradients with a Riemann metric, justifying the Waddington metaphor. Here, we
extend this representation to include parameter dependence and enumerate all
3-way cellular decisions realisable by tuning at most two parameters, which can
be generalized to include spatial coordinates in a tissue. All diagrams of cell
states vs model parameters are thereby enumerated. We unify a number of
standard models for spatial pattern formation by expressing them in potential
form. Turing systems appear non-potential yet in suitable variables the
dynamics are low dimensional, potential, and a time independent embedding
recovers the biological variables. Lateral inhibition is described by a saddle
point with many unstable directions. A model for the patterning of the
Drosophila eye appears as relaxation in a bistable potential. Geometric
reasoning provides intuitive dynamic models for development that are well
adapted to fit time-lapse data.

at the heart of commodity trading advisors (CTAs). These strategies have,
however, been found to have difficulties adjusting to rapid changes in market
conditions, such as during the 2020 market crash. In particular, immediately
after momentum turning points, where a trend reverses from an uptrend
(downtrend) to a downtrend (uptrend), time-series momentum (TSMOM) strategies
are prone to making bad bets. To improve the response to regime change, we
introduce a novel approach, where we insert an online changepoint detection
(CPD) module into a Deep Momentum Network (DMN) [1904.04912] pipeline, which
uses an LSTM deep-learning architecture to simultaneously learn both trend
estimation and position sizing. Furthermore, our model is able to optimise the
way in which it balances 1) a slow momentum strategy which exploits persisting
trends, but does not overreact to localised price moves, and 2) a fast
mean-reversion strategy regime by quickly flipping its position, then swapping
it back again to exploit localised price moves. Our CPD module outputs a
changepoint location and severity score, allowing our model to learn to respond
to varying degrees of disequilibrium, or smaller and more localised
changepoints, in a data driven manner. Back-testing our model over the period
1995-2020, the addition of the CPD module leads to an improvement in Sharpe
ratio of one-third. The module is especially beneficial in periods of
significant nonstationarity, and in particular, over the most recent years
tested (2015-2020) the performance boost is approximately two-thirds. This is
interesting as traditional momentum strategies have been underperforming in
this period.

This class can be understood as a special case of decomposition spaces, and it
turns out that the question whether two different dilation groups $H_1,H_2$

quasi-isometry condition can be characterized algebraically. We close with the

contain several transactions issued by one or more users, and where validity
and order of transactions within a block is determined by an external
application-dependent function that can capture various approaches for
order-fairness in the literature. Based on these abstractions, we propose a
reduction from state machine replication to repeated consensus, such that user
fairness is achieved using the consensus module as a black box. This approach
allows to achieve fairness as an add-on on top of preexisting consensus modules
in blockchains based on repeated consensus.

redundancy-$d$ scheduling, which is a special case of the fork-join model. In
particular, for regularly varying job sizes with tail index $-\nu$ the tail
index of the response time for the c.o.s. variant of redundancy-$d$ equals
$-\min\{d_{\mathrm{cap}}(\nu-1),\nu\}$, where $d_{\mathrm{cap}} =
\min\{d,N-k\}$, $N$ is the number of servers and $k$ is the integer part of the

Building off the work of Enflo, we are then able to provide multiple

the usage of modern experimental data from the CERN SPS eliminates several of
the most important limitations inherent to earlier studies of this type. In
both studies, the standard mechanism of baryon stopping with preservation of
the diquark, proposed by Capella and Tran Thanh Van fails to describe the
distribution of non-strange baryons in collisions of the projectile proton with
{\em more than one} nucleon from the carbon target obtained from experimental
data, and the upper limit for the contribution of this mechanism can be
established. In both cases, the conclusion is that the projectile diquark must
be very often disintegrated. This opens new diagrams not available in
proton-proton collisions which lead to the transport of baryon number over long
distances in rapidity. The present limitations, and possibility of improvement
in both approaches are discussed. The implications of our findings for new
measurements are addressed, in particular using antiproton beams.

sampling frequencies, which is detrimental to signal processing. Fundamentally,
sampling rate offset (SRO) nonlinearly relates the discrete-time signals
acquired by different sensor nodes. As such, retrieval of SRO from the
available signals requires nonlinear estimation, like double-cross-correlation
processing (DXCP), and frequently results in biased estimation. SRO
compensation by asynchronous sampling rate conversion (ASRC) on the signals
then leaves an unacceptable residual. As a remedy to this problem, multi-stage
procedures have been devised to diminish the SRO residual with multiple
iterations of SRO estimation and ASRC over the entire signal. This paper
converts the mechanism of offline multi-stage processing into a continuous
feedback-control loop comprising a controlled ASRC unit followed by an online
implementation of DXCP-based SRO estimation. To support the design of an
optimum internal model control unit for this closed-loop system, the paper
deploys an analytical dynamical model of the proposed online DXCP. The
resulting control architecture then merely applies a single treatment of each
signal frame, while efficiently diminishing SRO bias with time. Evaluations
with both speech and Gaussian input demonstrate that the high accuracy of
multi-stage processing is maintained at the low complexity of single-stage

difference. Our backfitting algorithm also collapses the fixed effect with one
random effect at a time in a way that is analogous to the collapsed Gibbs
sampler of Papaspiliopoulos et al. (2020). We use a symmetric operator that
facilitates efficient covariance computation. We illustrate our method on a

has been developed for high quality images taken in clear weather. However, in
bad weather conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, and dense fog, the poor
visibility owing to rain streaks, rain accumulation, and snowflakes causes a
serious degradation of image quality. This hinders the extraction of useful
visual features and results in deteriorated image captioning performance. To
address practical issues, this study introduces a new encoder for captioning
heavy rain images. The central idea is to transform output features extracted
from heavy rain input images into semantic visual features associated with
words and sentence context. To achieve this, a target encoder is initially
trained in an encoder-decoder framework to associate visual features with
semantic words. Subsequently, the objects in a heavy rain image are rendered
visible by using an initial reconstruction subnetwork (IRS) based on a heavy
rain model. The IRS is then combined with another semantic visual feature
matching subnetwork (SVFMS) to match the output features of the IRS with the
semantic visual features of the pretrained target encoder. The proposed encoder
is based on the joint learning of the IRS and SVFMS. It is is trained in an
end-to-end manner, and then connected to the pretrained decoder for image
captioning. It is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed encoder can
generate semantic visual features associated with words even from heavy rain
images, thereby increasing the accuracy of the generated captions.

measure their relative security impact. In the physical world we can often
measure the impact of individual elements to a system. However, in cyber
security we often lack ground truth (i.e., the ability to directly measure
significance). In this work we propose to solve this by leveraging human expert
opinion to provide ground truth. Experts are iteratively asked to compare pairs
of security elements to determine their relative significance. On the back end
our knowledge encoding tool performs a form of binary insertion sort on a set
of security elements using each expert as an oracle for the element
comparisons. The tool not only sorts the elements (note that equality may be
permitted), but it also records the strength or degree of each relationship.
The output is a directed acyclic 'constraint' graph that provides a total
ordering among the sets of equivalent elements. Multiple constraint graphs are
then unified together to form a single graph that is used to generate a scoring
or prioritization system. For our empirical study, we apply this
domain-agnostic measurement approach to generate scoring/prioritization systems
in the areas of vulnerability scoring, privacy control prioritization, and
cyber security control evaluation.

Since FPGA designs are encoded in a bitstream, securing the bitstream is of the
utmost importance. Adversaries have many motivations to recover and manipulate
the bitstream, including design cloning, IP theft, manipulation of the design,
or design subversions e.g., through hardware Trojans. Given that FPGAs are
often part of cyber-physical systems e.g., in aviation, medical, or industrial
devices, this can even lead to physical harm. Consequently, vendors have
introduced bitstream encryption, offering authenticity and confidentiality.
Even though attacks against bitstream encryption have been proposed in the
past, e.g., side-channel analysis and probing, these attacks require
sophisticated equipment and considerable technical expertise. In this paper, we
introduce novel low-cost attacks against the Xilinx 7-Series (and Virtex-6)

bound states in the continuum (BICs) that are valuable for many applications.
It is known that generic BICs in periodic structures with an up-down mirror
symmetry and an in-plane inversion symmetry are robust with respect to
structural perturbations that preserve these two symmetries. For
two-dimensional (2D) structures with one periodic direction and the up-down
mirror symmetry (without the in-plane inversion symmetry), it was recently
established that some scalar BICs can be found by tuning a single structural
parameter. In this paper, we analyze vectorial BICs in such 2D structures, and
show that a typical vectorial BIC with nonzero wavenumbers in both the
invariant and the periodic directions can only be found by tuning two
structural parameters. Using an all-order perturbation method, we prove that
such a vectorial BIC exists as a curve in the 3D space of three generic
parameters. Our theory is validated by numerical examples involving periodic
arrays of dielectric cylinders. The numerical results also illustrate the
conservation of topological charge when structural parameters are varied, if
both BICs and circularly polarized states (CPSs) are included. Our study
reveals a fundamental property of BICs in periodic structure and provides a
systematically approach for finding BICs in structures with less symmetry.

However the stability of these edge modes to interactions has traditionally
required the system to be many-body localized in order to suppress heating. In
contrast, here we show that even in the absence of disorder, and in the
presence of bulk heating, $\pi$ edge modes are long lived. Their lifetime is
extracted from exact diagonalization and is found to be non-perturbative in the
interaction strength. A tunneling estimate for the lifetime is obtained by
mapping the stroboscopic time-evolution to dynamics of a single particle in
Krylov subspace. In this subspace, the $\pi$ edge mode manifests as the
quasi-stable edge mode of an inhomogeneous Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model whose
dimerization vanishes in the bulk of the Krylov chain.

interesting approach is that of obtaining LQ-like behavior from kinetic models,
systems of differential equations that model the induction and repair of
damage. Development of such kinetic models is particularly interesting for
application to continuous dose rate therapies, such as molecular radiotherapy
or brachytherapy. In this work, we present a simple kinetic model that
describes the kinetics of populations of tumor cells, rather than
lethal/sub-lethal lesions, which may be especially useful for application to
continuous dose rate therapies, as in molecular radiotherapy. The
multi-compartment model consists of a set of three differential equations. The
model incorporates in an easy way different cross-interacting compartments of
cells forming a tumor, and may be of especial interest for studying dynamics of
treated tumors. In the fast dose delivery limit, the model can be analytically
solved, obtaining a simple closed-form expression. Fitting of several surviving
curves with both this solution and the LQ model shows that they produce similar
fits, despite being functionally different. We have also investigated the
operation of the model in the continuous dose rate scenario, firstly by fitting
pre-clinical data of tumor response to 131I-CLR1404 therapy, and secondly by
showing how damage repair and proliferation rates can cause a treatment to
achieve control or not. Kinetic models like the one presented in this work may

likewise attackers makes them often threatened by fault attacks: a single fault
during the computation of a cryptographic primitive can lead to a total loss of
system security. This can have serious consequences, e.g., in safetycritical
systems, including bodily harm and catastrophic technical failures. However,
countermeasures often focus on isolated fault models and high layers of
abstraction. This leads to a dangerous sense of security, because exploitable
faults that are only visible at machine code level might not be covered by
countermeasures. In this work we present ARMORY, a fully automated open source
framework for exhaustive fault simulation on binaries of the ubiquitous ARM-M
class. It allows engineers and analysts to efficiently scan a binary for
potential weaknesses against arbitrary combinations of multi-variate fault
injections under a large variety of fault models. Using ARMORY, we demonstrate
the power of fully automated fault analysis and the dangerous implications of
applying countermeasures without knowledge of physical addresses and offsets.
We exemplarily analyze two case studies, which are highly relevant for
practice: a DFA on AES (cryptographic) and a secure bootloader
(non-cryptographic). Our results show that indeed numerous exploitable faults
found by ARMORY which occur in the actual implementations are easily missed in
manual inspection. Crucially, most faults are only visible when taking machine
code information, i.e., addresses and offsets, into account. Surprisingly, we
show that a countermeasure that protects against one type of fault can actually
largely increase the vulnerability to other fault models. Our work demonstrates
the need for countermeasures that, at least in their evaluation, are not

which is not ideal in pHRC. In this paper we propose a new learning algorithm
to learn ProMPs incrementally in pHRC settings. Our algorithm incorporates new
demonstrations sequentially as they arrive, allowing humans to observe the
robot's learning progress and incrementally shape the robot's motor skill. A
built in forgetting factor allows for corrective demonstrations resulting from
the human's learning curve or changes in task constraints. We compare the
performance of our algorithm to existing batch ProMP algorithms on reference

M$_{\oplus}$ and $M_{\rm c}\sin{i} = 3.75^{+0.48}_{-0.47}$ M$_{\oplus}$), and
Gl 393, a bright M2.0 dwarf with one terrestrial planet ($M_{\rm b}\sin{i} =
1.71 \pm 0.24$ M$_{\oplus}$). Although both stars were proposed to belong to
young stellar kinematic groups, we estimate their ages to be older than about
700 Ma. The two planets around G 264-012 were discovered using only
radial-velocity (RV) data from the CARMENES exoplanet survey, with estimated
orbital periods of $2.30$ d and $8.05$ d, respectively. Photometric monitoring
and analysis of activity indicators reveal a third signal present in the RV
measurements, at about 100 d, caused by stellar rotation. The planet Gl 393 b
was discovered in the RV data from the HARPS, CARMENES, and HIRES instruments.
Its identification was only possible after modelling, with a Gaussian process
(GP), the variability produced by the magnetic activity of the star. For the
earliest observations, this variability produced a forest of peaks in the
periodogram of the RVs at around the 34 d rotation period determined from {\em
Kepler} data, which disappeared in the latest epochs. After correcting for them
with this GP model, a significant signal showed at a period of $7.03$ d. No
significant signals in any of our spectral activity indicators or
contemporaneous photometry were found at any of the planetary periods. Given
the orbital and stellar properties, the equilibrium temperatures of the three
planets are all higher than that for Earth. Current planet formation theories
suggest that these two systems represent a common type of architecture. This is
consistent with formation following the core accretion paradigm.

address the questions raised by Thul et al. (2020), who clearly demonstrated

simulation studies implementing different by-subject longitudinal effects. The
maximal LMM emerges as slightly conservative compared to GAMMs, and GAMMs
provide estimated coefficients that can be less variable across simulation
runs. We also discuss two datasets where time-varying effects interact with
numerical predictors in a theoretically informative way. Furthermore, we argue
that the wide range of tools that GAMMs make available to researcher across all

introduce a distinction between replicable and non-replicable non-linear

interdependency between academic hospitals and universities in the context of
the Leiden Ranking. A key question for ranking universities is whether or not
to allocate the publication output of affiliated hospitals to universities.
Hospital nomenclatures vary worldwide to denote some form of collaboration with
a university: academic hospitals, teaching hospitals, university hospitals, and
academic medical centres do not correspond to universally standard definitions.
Thus, rather than seeking a normative definition of academic hospitals, we are
proposing a workflow that aligns the university-hospital relationship with one
of three general models: full integration of the hospital and the medical
faculty into a single organization; health science centres in which hospitals
and medical faculty remain separate entities albeit within the same governance
structure; and structures in which universities and hospitals are separate
entities which collaborate with one another. This classification system
provides a standard by which we can allocate publications which note
affiliations with academic hospitals. Our three-step workflow effectively
translates the three above-mentioned models into two types of instrumental
relationships for the assignation of publications: ""associate"" and ""component"".
When a hospital and a medical faculty are fully integrated or when a hospital
is part of a health science centre, the relationship is classified as
component. When a hospital follows the model of collaboration and support, the
relationship is classified as associate. The compilation of data following
these standards allows for a more uniform comparison between worldwide
educational and research systems.

models, early exiting has gained much attention in the NLP community. It allows
samples to exit early at internal classifiers without passing through the
entire model. Most existing work usually trains the internal classifiers
independently and employs an exiting strategy to decide whether or not to exit
based on the confidence of the current internal classifier. However, none of
these works takes full advantage of the fact that the internal classifiers are
trained to solve the same task therefore can be used to construct an ensemble.
In this paper, we show that a novel objective function for the training of the
ensemble internal classifiers can be naturally induced from the perspective of
ensemble learning and information theory. The proposed training objective
consists of two terms: one for accuracy and the other for the diversity of the
internal classifiers. In contrast, the objective used in prior work is exactly
the accuracy term of our training objective therefore only optimizes the
accuracy but not diversity. Further, we propose a simple voting-based strategy
that considers predictions of all the past internal classifiers to infer the
correct label and decide whether to exit. Experimental results on various NLP
tasks show that our proposed objective function and voting-based strategy can
achieve better accuracy-speed trade-offs.

provide misleading information for aggregation in GCN, especially the graphs

representations from nearby nodes via re-connected adjacency matrix and is
applied to graphs with various levels of homophily. Experimental results on a

build adaptive numerical schemes for Partial Differential Equations and
time-adaptive meshes, allowing for error control. We have introduced this
strategy before to construct adaptive lattice Boltzmann methods with this
interesting feature.Furthermore, these schemes allow for an effective memory
compression of the solution when spatially localized phenomena -- such as
shocks or fronts -- are involved, to rely on the original scheme without any
manipulation at the finest level of grid and to reach a high level of accuracy
on the solution.Nevertheless, the peculiar way of modeling the desired physical
phenomena in the lattice Boltzmann schemes calls, besides the possibility of
controlling the error introduced by the mesh adaptation, for a deeper and more
precise understanding of how mesh adaptation alters the physics approximated by
the numerical strategy. In this contribution, this issue is studied by
performing the equivalent equations analysis of the adaptive method after
writing the scheme under an adapted formalism. It provides an essential tool to
master the perturbations introduced by the adaptive numerical strategy, which
can thus be devised to preserve the desired features of the reference scheme at
a high order of accuracy. The theoretical considerations are corroborated by
numerical experiments in both the 1D and 2D context, showing the relevance of
the analysis. In particular, we show that our numerical method outperforms
traditional approaches, whether or not the solution of the reference scheme
converges to the solution of the target equation.Furthermore, we discuss the
influence of various collision strategies for non-linear problems, showing that
they have only a marginal impact on the quality of the solution, thus further
assessing the proposed strategy.

outsourcing code and data into the cloud requires enterprises to trust cloud
providers not to meddle with their data. To reduce the level of trust towards
cloud providers, AMD has introduced Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). By
encrypting Virtual Machines (VMs), SEV aims to ensure data confidentiality,
despite a compromised or curious Hypervisor. The SEV Encrypted State (SEV-ES)
extension additionally protects the VM's register state from unauthorized
access. Yet, both extensions do not provide integrity of the VM's memory, which
has already been abused to leak the protected data or to alter the VM's
control-flow. In this paper, we introduce the SEVerity attack; a missing puzzle
piece in the series of attacks against the AMD SEV family. Specifically, we
abuse the system's lack of memory integrity protection to inject and execute
arbitrary code within SEV-ES-protected VMs. Contrary to previous code execution
attacks against the AMD SEV family, SEVerity neither relies on a specific CPU
version nor on any code gadgets inside the VM. Instead, SEVerity abuses the
fact that SEV-ES prohibits direct memory access into the encrypted memory.
Specifically, SEVerity injects arbitrary code into the encrypted VM through I/O
channels and uses the Hypervisor to locate and trigger the execution of the
encrypted payload. This allows us to sidestep the protection mechanisms of
SEV-ES. Overall, our results demonstrate a success rate of 100% and hence
highlight that memory integrity protection is an obligation when encrypting
VMs. Consequently, our work presents the final stroke in a series of attacks
against AMD SEV and SEV-ES and renders the present implementation as incapable
of protecting against a curious, vulnerable, or malicious Hypervisor.

particle dark matter and other rare interactions. It will operate a 50 t liquid
xenon detector, with 40 t in the time projection chamber (TPC). To inform the
final detector design and technical choices, a series of technological
questions must first be addressed. Here we describe a full-scale demonstrator
in the vertical dimension, Xenoscope, with the main goal of achieving electron
drift over a 2.6 m distance, which is the scale of the DARWIN TPC. We have
designed and constructed the facility infrastructure, including the cryostat,
cryogenic and purification systems, the xenon storage and recuperation system,
as well as the slow control system. We have also designed a xenon purity
monitor and the TPC, with the fabrication of the former nearly complete. In a
first commissioning run of the facility without an inner detector, we
demonstrated the nominal operational reach of Xenoscope and benchmarked the
components of the cryogenic and slow control systems, demonstrating reliable
and continuous operation of all subsystems over 40 days. The infrastructure is
thus ready for the integration of the purity monitor, followed by the TPC.
Further applications of the facility include R&D on the high voltage
feedthrough for DARWIN, measurements of electron cloud diffusion, as well as
measurements of optical properties of liquid xenon. In the future, Xenoscope
will be available as a test platform for the DARWIN collaboration to
characterise new detector technologies.

risk in matrix sensing. In both the general case of rectangular matrices and
the particular case of positive semidefinite matrices, a simple potential-based
analysis in terms of the Bregman divergence allows us to establish convergence
of mirror descent -- with different choices of the mirror maps -- to a matrix
that, among all global minimizers of the empirical risk, minimizes a quantity
explicitly related to the nuclear norm, the Frobenius norm, and the von Neumann
entropy. In both cases, this characterization implies that mirror descent, a
first-order algorithm minimizing the unregularized empirical risk, recovers
low-rank matrices under the same set of assumptions that are sufficient to
guarantee recovery for nuclear-norm minimization. When the sensing matrices are
symmetric and commute, we show that gradient descent with full-rank factorized
parametrization is a first-order approximation to mirror descent, in which case
we obtain an explicit characterization of the implicit bias of gradient flow as
a by-product.

lower-order moments of the distribution. In addition to the usual density and

understanding new aspects of the behavior of active liquids. By imposing a
suitable closure of the hydrodynamic moment equations and truncation of the

mesoscopic balance equations. At this stage, we focus our interest on the small
deviations of the hydrodynamic fields from their averages and apply the methods
of the theory of linear hydrodynamic fluctuations. Our treatment sheds light on
the peculiar properties of isotropic active liquids and their emergent
dynamical collective phenomena, such as the spontaneous alignment of the
particle velocities. We predict the existence within the liquid phase of
spatial equal-time Ornstein-Zernike-like velocity correlations both for the
longitudinal and the transverse modes. At variance with active solids, in
active liquids, the correlation length of the transverse velocity fluctuations
is sensibly shorter than the length of the longitudinal fluctuations. In
particular, the latter depends on the sound speed and increases with the
persistence time, while the former displays a weaker dependence on these

maps (DM) and ghost point diffusion maps (GPDM), to solve the time-dependent
advection-diffusion PDE on unknown smooth manifolds without and with
boundaries. The core idea is to directly approximate the spatial components of
the differential operator on the manifold with a local integral operator and
combine it with the standard implicit time difference scheme. When the manifold
has a boundary, a simplified version of the GPDM approach is used to overcome
the bias of the integral approximation near the boundary. The Monte-Carlo
discretization of the integral operator over the point cloud data gives rise to
a mesh-free formulation that is natural for randomly distributed points, even
when the manifold is embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. Here, we
establish the convergence of the proposed solver on appropriate topologies,
depending on the distribution of point cloud data and boundary type. We provide
numerical results to validate the convergence results on various examples that
involve simple geometry and an unknown manifold. Additionally, we also found
positive results in solving the one-dimensional viscous Burger's equation where
GPDM is adopted with a pseudo-spectral Galerkin framework to approximate
nonlinear advection term.

focus on the latter. We implemented on an industrial robot in a VR environment
nonverbal behavior signalling the user that it is now their turn to proceed
with a pick-and-place task. The signals were presented in four different test
conditions: no signal, robot arm gesture, light signal, combination of robot
arm gesture and light signal. Test conditions were presented to the
participants in two rounds. The qualitative analysis was conducted with focus
on (i) potential signals in human behaviour indicating why some participants
immediately took over from the robot whereas others needed more time to
explore, (ii) human reactions after the nonverbal signal of the robot, and
(iii) whether participants showed different behaviours in the different test
conditions. We could not identify potential signals why some participants were
immediately successful and others not. There was a bandwidth of behaviors after
the robot stopped working, e.g. participants rearranged the objects, looked at
the robot or the object, or gestured the robot to proceed. We found evidence
that robot deictic gestures were helpful for the human to correctly interpret
what to do next. Moreover, there was a strong tendency that humans interpreted
the light signal projected on the robot's gripper as a request to give the
object in focus to the robot. Whereas a robot's pointing gesture at the object

energy, dark matter and inflation. Quantum cosmology treats the cosmology
quantum mechanically and is important when quantum effects need to be accounted
for, especially in the very early Universe. Quantum computing is an emerging
new method of computing which excels in simulating quantum systems. Quantum
computing may have some advantages when simulating quantum cosmology,
especially because the Euclidean action of gravity is unbounded from below,
making the implementation of Monte Carlo simulation problematic. In this paper
we present several examples of the application of quantum computing to
cosmology. These include a dark energy model that is related to Kaluza-Klein
theory, dark matter models where the dark sector is described by a self
interacting gauge field or a conformal scalar field and an inflationary model
with a slow roll potential. We implement quantum computations in the IBM QISKit
software framework and show how to apply the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
(VQE) and Evolution of Hamiltonian (EOH) algorithms to solve the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation that can be used to describe the cosmology in the mini-superspace
approximation. We find excellent agreement with classical computing results and
describe the accuracy of the different quantum algorithms. Finally we discuss
how these methods can be scaled to larger problems going beyond the
mini-superspace approximation where the quantum computer may exceed the

small-grain-to-gas mass ratio of $\gtrsim0.0001$. The mid-plane temperature
varies as the waves propagate and hence gap and ring structures can be seen in

observed even if the disk is fully optically thick since it is induced by the
temperature variation, while density-induced substructures would disappear in
the optically thick regime. The fractional separation between TWI-induced ring
and gap is $\Delta r/r \sim$ 0.2-0.4 at $\sim$ 10-50 au, which is comparable to
those found by ALMA. Due to the temperature variation, snow lines of volatile

explicit time dynamics of the switching process in these bilayers as of yet.
Furthermore, time-resolved measurements of switching of other materials are
typically done with a constant applied field to reset the magnetization between
consecutive pulses and thus ensure repeatable behavior. In this paper we
experimentally resolve the explicit dynamics of the switching process in Co/Gd,
and the influence of applied magnetic fields on the switching process. We
observe that after a switch within several picoseconds, the magnetization
switches back at a timescale of hundreds of picoseconds. This backswitch
includes a strong dependence on the magnetic field strength even at sub-tesla
fields, significantly smaller than the exchange fields that govern the
switching dynamics. This surprising behaviour is explained by a combination of
longitudinal switching (on a picosecond timescale), precessional switching (on
a nanosecond timescale) and domain-wall motion (on a timescale of 10 ns and
beyond). We discuss these different switching regimes and their relative
importance using simple model calculations.

polarization-flipped signal photons to be detected with high-purity x-ray

several key details of the x-ray optical ingredients that exert a strong

for Receiver. We examine the following question - how well can Sender perform,
in terms of persuading Receiver to adopt, when ignorant of Receiver's utility?
We take a robust (adversarial) approach to study this problem; that is, our
goal is to design signaling schemes for Sender that perform well for all
possible Receiver's utilities. We measure performance of signaling schemes via
the notion of (additive) regret: the difference between Sender's hypothetically
optimal utility had she known Receiver's utility function and her actual
utility induced by the given scheme.
  On the negative side, we show that if Sender has no knowledge at all about
Receiver's utility, then Sender has no signaling scheme that performs robustly
well. On the positive side, we show that if Sender only knows Receiver's
ordinal preferences of the states of nature - i.e., Receiver's utility upon
adoption is monotonic as a function of the state - then Sender can guarantee a
surprisingly low regret even when the number of states tends to infinity. In
fact, we exactly pin down the minimum regret value that Sender can guarantee in
this case, which turns out to be at most 1/e. We further show that such
positive results are not possible under the alternative performance measure of
a multiplicative approximation ratio by proving that no constant ratio can be
guaranteed even for monotonic Receiver's utility; this may serve to demonstrate
the merits of regret as a robust performance measure that is not too
pessimistic. Finally, we analyze an intermediate setting in between the
no-knowledge and the ordinal-knowledge settings.

tasks in many real-world scenarios. Although the pre-trained models (PTMs) have
significantly improved the performance of various sequence labeling tasks,
their computational cost is expensive. To alleviate this problem, we extend the
recent successful early-exit mechanism to accelerate the inference of PTMs for
sequence labeling tasks. However, existing early-exit mechanisms are
specifically designed for sequence-level tasks, rather than sequence labeling.
In this paper, we first propose a simple extension of sentence-level early-exit
for sequence labeling tasks. To further reduce the computational cost, we also
propose a token-level early-exit mechanism that allows partial tokens to exit
early at different layers. Considering the local dependency inherent in
sequence labeling, we employed a window-based criterion to decide for a token
whether or not to exit. The token-level early-exit brings the gap between
training and inference, so we introduce an extra self-sampling fine-tuning
stage to alleviate it. The extensive experiments on three popular sequence
labeling tasks show that our approach can save up to 66%-75% inference cost
with minimal performance degradation. Compared with competitive compressed
models such as DistilBERT, our approach can achieve better performance under
the same speed-up ratios of 2X, 3X, and 4X.

aspects. One is that for the different characteristics (with the
spatial-variation feature distribution) of the LiDAR images w.r.t. the normal
color images, we introduce the attention mechanism into our model to improve
the quality of the estimated flow. The other one is that to tackle the lack of
large-scale LiDAR-image annotations, we present an unsupervised method, which
directly minimizes the inconsistency between the reference image and the
reconstructed image based on the estimated optical flow. Extensive experimental
results have shown that our proposed model outperforms other mainstream models

  Estimation",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  To improve user experience and profits of corporations, modern industrial
recommender systems usually aim to select the items that are most likely to be
interacted with (e.g., clicks and purchases). However, they overlook the fact
that users may purchase the items even without recommendations. To select these
effective items, it is essential to estimate the causal effect of
recommendations. The real effective items are the ones which can contribute to
purchase probability uplift. Nevertheless, it is difficult to obtain the real
causal effect since we can only recommend or not recommend an item to a user at
one time. Furthermore, previous works usually rely on the randomized controlled
trial~(RCT) experiment to evaluate their performance. However, it is usually
not practicable in the recommendation scenario due to its unavailable time
consuming. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a causal
collaborative filtering~(CausCF) method inspired by the widely adopted
collaborative filtering~(CF) technique. It is based on the idea that similar
users not only have a similar taste on items, but also have similar treatment
effect under recommendations. CausCF extends the classical matrix factorization
to the tensor factorization with three dimensions -- user, item, and treatment.
Furthermore, we also employs regression discontinuity design (RDD) to evaluate
the precision of the estimated causal effects from different models. With the
testable assumptions, RDD analysis can provide an unbiased causal conclusion
without RCT experiments. Through dedicated experiments on both the public
datasets and the industrial application, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed CausCF on the causal effect estimation and ranking performance

the existence of a topological surface state (TSS) and a bulk HH band, both

time due to the difficulty of computing precisely the log-likelihood gradient.
Over the past decades, many works have proposed more or less successful
training recipes but without studying the crucial quantity of the problem: the
mixing time, i.e. the number of Monte Carlo iterations needed to sample new
configurations from a model. In this work, we show that this mixing time plays
a crucial role in the dynamics and stability of the trained model, and that
RBMs operate in two well-defined regimes, namely equilibrium and
out-of-equilibrium, depending on the interplay between this mixing time of the
model and the number of steps, $k$, used to approximate the gradient. We
further show empirically that this mixing time increases with the learning,
which often implies a transition from one regime to another as soon as $k$
becomes smaller than this time. In particular, we show that using the popular
$k$ (persistent) contrastive divergence approaches, with $k$ small, the
dynamics of the learned model are extremely slow and often dominated by strong
out-of-equilibrium effects. On the contrary, RBMs trained in equilibrium
display faster dynamics, and a smooth convergence to dataset-like
configurations during the sampling. Finally we discuss how to exploit in
practice both regimes depending on the task one aims to fulfill: (i) short $k$
can be used to generate convincing samples in short learning times, (ii) large
$k$ (or increasingly large) is needed to learn the correct equilibrium
distribution of the RBM. Finally, the existence of these two operational
regimes seems to be a general property of energy based models trained via
likelihood maximization.

nova rate of $\sim 10$ yr$^{-1}$ and the predicted rate from Galactic models of
$\sim 30$--50 yr$^{-1}$. One explanation for this discrepancy is that many
novae are hidden by interstellar extinction, but the degree to which dust can
obscure novae is poorly constrained. We use newly available all-sky
three-dimensional dust maps to compare the brightness and spatial distribution
of known novae to that predicted from relatively simple models in which novae
trace Galactic stellar mass. We find that only half ($\sim 48$\%) of novae are
expected to be easily detectable ($g \lesssim 15$) with current all-sky optical
surveys such as the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). This
fraction is much lower than previously estimated, showing that dust does
substantially affect nova detection in the optical. By comparing complementary
survey results from ASAS-SN, OGLE-IV, and the Palomar Gattini IR-survey in the
context of our modeling, we find a tentative Galactic nova rate of $\sim 40$
yr$^{-1}$, though this could decrease to as low as $\sim 30$ yr$^{-1}$
depending on the assumed distribution of novae within the Galaxy. These
preliminary estimates will be improved in future work through more
sophisticated modeling of nova detection in ASAS-SN and other surveys.

are promising candidates to study the new physics at the sources that produce
them. With the increasing development of more sensitive detectors in the coming
years, we will infer several intrinsic properties from incident neutrinos. In
particular, we centralise our study in those produced by thermal processes in
short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and their interactions within the central
engine's anisotropic medium. On the one hand, we consider baryonic winds
produced with a strong magnetic contribution, and on the other hand, we treat
only neutrino-driven winds. First, we obtain the effective neutrino potential
considering both baryonic density profiles around the central engine. Then, we
get the three-flavour oscillation probabilities in this medium to finally
calculate the expected neutrino ratios. We find a stronger angular dependence
on the expected neutrino ratios, which, incidentally, contrast from the
expected theoretical ratios without considering the winds' additional
contribution. The joint analysis of this observable, together with the sGRB
ejected jet angle, might lead to an effective mechanism to discriminate between
the involved merger progenitors (black hole-neutron star or neutron
star-neutron star), acting as an additional detection channel to gravitational
waves.

strange quark planets. The detection of the binary neutron star merger event

this study, the tidal deformability of strange quark planets and strange quark
dwarfs are calculated. It is found that the tidal deformability of strange
quark objects is smaller than that of normal matter counterparts. For a typical
0.6 M$_\odot$ compact star, the tidal deformability of a strange dwarf is about
1.4 times less than that of a normal white dwarf. The difference is even more
significant between strange quark planets and normal matter planets.
Additionally, if the strange quark planet is a bare one (i.e., not covered by a
normal matter curst), the tidal deformability will be extremely small, which
means bare strange quark planets will hardly be distorted by tidal forces. Our
study clearly proves the effectiveness of identifying strange quark objects via
searching for strange quark planets through gravitational-wave observations.

Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve traffic congestion problems in urban

microscopic simulation software (e.g., SUMO), while it is not suitable for
city-wide control due to the computational burden and gridlock effect. To the
best of our knowledge, there is a lack of studies on the large-scale traffic
simulator for DRL testbeds, which could further hinder the development of DRL.
In view of this, we propose a meso-macro traffic simulator for very large-scale
DRL scenarios. The proposed simulator integrates mesoscopic and macroscopic
traffic simulation models to improve efficiency and eliminate gridlocks. The
mesoscopic link model simulates flow dynamics on roads, and the macroscopic
Bathtub model depicts vehicle movement in regions. Moreover, both types of
models can be hybridized to accommodate various DRL tasks. This creates portals
for mixed transportation applications under different contexts. The result
shows that the developed simulator only takes 46 seconds to finish a 24-hour
simulation in a very large city with 2.2 million vehicles, which is much faster
than SUMO. Additionally, we develop a graphic interface for users to visualize
the simulation results in a web explorer. In the future, the developed
meso-macro traffic simulator could serve as a new environment for very

solve challenging problems, yet can be difficult to stabilize and understand.
Part of this complexity originates from the discrete update steps given by
simultaneous or alternating gradient descent, which causes each player to drift
away from the continuous gradient flow -- a phenomenon we call discretization
drift. Using backward error analysis, we derive modified continuous dynamical
systems that closely follow the discrete dynamics. These modified dynamics
provide an insight into the notorious challenges associated with zero-sum
games, including Generative Adversarial Networks. In particular, we identify
distinct components of the discretization drift that can alter performance and
in some cases destabilize the game. Finally, quantifying discretization drift
allows us to identify regularizers that explicitly cancel harmful forms of
drift or strengthen beneficial forms of drift, and thus improve performance of
GAN training.

candidates, also commonly dubbed as Macros. A possible signature of MDM is the
capture of baryons from the cosmological plasma in the pre-recombination epoch,
with the consequent injection of high-energy photons in the baryon-photon
plasma. By keeping a phenomenological approach, we consider two broad classes
of MDM in which Macros are composed either of ordinary matter or antimatter. In
both scenarios, we also analyze the impact of a non-vanishing electric charge
carried by Macros. We derive constraints on the Macro parameter space from
three cosmological processes: the change in the baryon density between the end
of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
decoupling, the production of spectral distortions in the CMB and the kinetic
coupling between charged MDM and baryons at the time of recombination. In the
case of neutral Macros we find that the tightest constraints are set by the
baryon density condition in most of the parameter space. For Macros composed of
ordinary matter and with binding energy $I$, this leads to the following bound
on the reduced cross-section: $\sigma_X/M_X \lesssim 6.8 \cdot 10^{-7}
\left(I/\mathrm{MeV}\right)^{-1.56} \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{g}^{-1}$. Charged
Macros with surface potential $V_X$, instead, are mainly constrained by the
tight coupling with baryons, resulting in $\sigma_X/M_X \lesssim 2 \cdot
10^{-11} \left(|V_X|/\mathrm{MeV}\right)^{-2} \text{cm}^2 \, \text{g}^{-1}$.
Finally, we show that future CMB spectral distortions experiments, like PIXIE
and SuperPIXIE, would have the sensitivity to probe larger regions of the
parameter space: this would allow either for a possible evidence or for an
improvement of the current bounds on Macros as dark matter candidates.

short-range correlation (SRC) physics is dominant and well accounted for by SRC
phenomenology. But an alternative and compelling picture emerges from
renormalization group (RG) evolution to low RG resolution. At high RG
resolution, SRCs are identified as components in the nuclear wave function with
relative pair momenta greater than the Fermi momentum. Scale separation results
in wave-function factorization that can be exploited with phenomenologies such
as the generalized contact formalism or the low-order correlation operator
approximation. Evolution to lower resolution shifts SRC physics from nuclear
structure to the reaction operators without changing the measured observables.
We show how the features of SRC phenomenology manifested at high RG resolution
are cleanly identified at low RG resolution using simple two-body operators and
local-density approximations with uncorrelated wave functions, all of which can
be systematically generalized. We verify that the experimental consequences to
date follow directly at low resolution from well-established properties of
nucleon-nucleon interactions such as the tensor force. Thus the RG reconciles
the contrasting pictures of the same experiment and shows how to get correct
results using wave functions without SRC components. Our demonstration has
implications for the analysis of knock-out reactions for which SRC physics is
not cleanly isolated.

years, due to its ability in capturing locality and translation invariance.
Recently, many vision transformer architectures have been proposed and they
show promising performance. A key component in vision transformers is the
fully-connected self-attention which is more powerful than CNNs in modelling
long range dependencies. However, since the current dense self-attention uses
all image patches (tokens) to compute attention matrix, it may neglect locality
of images patches and involve noisy tokens (e.g., clutter background and
occlusion), leading to a slow training process and potential degradation of
performance. To address these problems, we propose the $k$-NN attention for
boosting vision transformers. Specifically, instead of involving all the tokens
for attention matrix calculation, we only select the top-$k$ similar tokens
from the keys for each query to compute the attention map. The proposed $k$-NN
attention naturally inherits the local bias of CNNs without introducing
convolutional operations, as nearby tokens tend to be more similar than others.
In addition, the $k$-NN attention allows for the exploration of long range
correlation and at the same time filters out irrelevant tokens by choosing the
most similar tokens from the entire image. Despite its simplicity, we verify,
both theoretically and empirically, that $k$-NN attention is powerful in
speeding up training and distilling noise from input tokens. Extensive
experiments are conducted by using 11 different vision transformer
architectures to verify that the proposed $k$-NN attention can work with any
existing transformer architectures to improve its prediction performance. The
codes are available at \url{https://github.com/damo-cv/KVT}.

interpretation in the preterm group is particularly challenging; trained
experts are scarce and the task of interpreting EEG in real-time is arduous.
Preterm infants are reported to have a higher incidence of seizures compared to
term infants. Preterm EEG morphology differs from that of term infants, which
implies that seizure detection algorithms trained on term EEG may not be
appropriate. The task of developing preterm specific algorithms becomes
extra-challenging given the limited amount of annotated preterm EEG data
available. This paper explores novel deep learning (DL) architectures for the
task of neonatal seizure detection in preterm infants. The study tests and
compares several approaches to address the problem: training on data from
full-term infants; training on data from preterm infants; training on
age-specific preterm data and transfer learning. The system performance is
assessed on a large database of continuous EEG recordings of 575h in duration.
It is shown that the accuracy of a validated term-trained EEG seizure detection
algorithm, based on a support vector machine classifier, when tested on preterm
infants falls well short of the performance achieved for full-term infants. An
AUC of 88.3% was obtained when tested on preterm EEG as compared to 96.6%
obtained when tested on term EEG. When re-trained on preterm EEG, the
performance marginally increases to 89.7%. An alternative DL approach shows a
more stable trend when tested on the preterm cohort, starting with an AUC of
93.3% for the term-trained algorithm and reaching 95.0% by transfer learning
from the term model using available preterm data.

white dwarf stars. On the theoretical front, we very recently developed very
accurate H-He potential energies for the hydrogen 1s, 2s, and 2p states.
Nevertheless, an uncertainty remained about the asymptotic correlation of the
Sigma states and the electronic dipole transition moments. A similar difficulty
occurred in our first calculations for the resonance broadening of hydrogen
perturbed by collisions with neutral H atoms. The aim of this paper is twofold.
First, we clarify the question of the asymptotic correlation of the Sigma
states, and we show that relativistic contributions, even very tiny, may need
to be accounted for a correct long-range and asymptotic description of the
states because of the specific 2s 2p Coulomb degeneracy in hydrogen. This
effect of relativistic corrections, inducing small splitting of the 2s and 2p
states of H, is shown to be important for the Sigma-Sigma$ transition dipole
moments in H-He and is also discussed in H-H. Second, we use existent (H-H) and
newly determined (H-He) accurate potentials and properties to provide a
theoretical investigation of the collisional effects on the blue wing of the
Lyman-alpha line of H perturbed by He and H. We study the relative
contributions in the blue wing of the H and He atoms according to their

particles, questions of microswimmer guidance and control are becoming ever
more relevant and prevalent. In both the applications and theoretical study of
such microscale swimmers, control is often mediated by an engineered property
of the swimmer, such as in the case of magnetically propelled microrobots. In
this work, we will consider a modality of control that is applicable in more
generality, effecting guidance via modulation of a background fluid flow. Here,
considering a model swimmer in a commonplace flow and simple geometry, we
analyse and subsequently establish the efficacy of flow-mediated microswimmer
positional control, later touching upon a question of optimal control. Moving
beyond idealised notions of controllability and towards considerations of

spacetimes and associated complex/ real phase spaces, the coefficients of
geometric and physical objects depend both on base spacetime coordinates and
conventional (co) fiber velocity/ momentum variables like in (non) commutative
Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometry. For nonassociative and (non) commutative
phase spaces modelled as total spaces of (co) tangent bundles on Lorentz
manifolds enabled with star products and nonholonomic frames, we consider
associated nonlinear connection, N-connection, structures determining
conventional horizontal and (co) vertical (for instance, 4+4) splitting of

supporting numerical model for stability analysis, with rapid-enough response
to perform data assimilation in real time. A model should be built, such that
its response can be obtained faster than the physical evolution of the analyzed
phenomenon. In this work, Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) is used to boost
computational efficiency in solving the coupled hydro-mechanical system of

coupled hydro-mechanical equations that govern the groundwater flow, that are
made non-linear as a result of considering an unsaturated soil. The resulting

and classifying floating plastic debris in Mytilene (Greece), Limassol
(Cyprus), Calabria (Italy), and Beirut (Lebanon). Two ML models, i.e. Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were utilized to carry out the
classification analysis. In-situ plastic location data was collected from the
control experiment conducted in Mytilene, Greece and Limassol, Cyprus, and the
same was considered for training the models. Both remote sensing bands and
spectral indices were used for developing the ML models. A spectral signature
profile for plastic was created for discriminating the floating plastic from
other marine debris. A newly developed index, kernel Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (kNDVI), was incorporated into the modelling to examine its
contribution to model performances. Both SVM and RF were performed well in five
models and test case combinations. Among the two ML models, the highest
performance was measured for the RF. The inclusion of kNDVI was found effective
and increased the model performances, reflected by high balanced accuracy
measured for model 2 (~80% to ~98 % for SVM and ~87% to ~97 % for RF). Using
the best-performed model, an automated floating plastic detection system was
developed and tested in Calabria and Beirut. For both sites, the trained model
had detected the floating plastic with ~99% accuracy. Among the six predictors,
the FDI was found the most important variable for detecting marine floating
plastic. These findings collectively suggest that high-resolution remote
sensing imagery and the automated ML models can be an effective alternative for
the cost-effective detection of marine floating plastic.

queueing model with phase-type inter-retrial times in cellular networks. It is
considered that the pattern of the new call arrival and handoff call arrival
follows Markovian arrival process (MAP). The service times of both types of
calls are phase-type (PH ) distributed with different service rates, and
inter-failure & inter-repair times of channels are exponentially distributed.
For the prioritization of handoff calls, G channels are kept in reserve for
handoff calls. When all the available channels, say S, are busy at the arrival
epoch of a handoff call, the handoff call will be dropped. Whereas a new call
will be blocked and will have an option to join the orbit of infinite capacity
or leave the system without getting the connection, if at least S-G channels
are busy. A new call in the orbit, termed as retrial call, retries to get the
connection after a random interval which follows PH distribution. This model is
analyzed as a level-dependent-quasi-birth-death (LDQBD) process by applying
matrix-analytic method (MAM). Further, the closed-form expressions for
essential performance measures of the proposed model are derived. Through
numerical illustrations, the behaviour of performance measures depending on the
various relevant intensities is discussed. An expected cost optimization
problem is formulated to determine the optimal value of service intensity and
the optimal value of repair intensity. The cost function analysis is executed
by employing Simulated Annealing (SA) method.
