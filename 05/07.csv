metals, which is manifested in the description of transport properties that the
electrical resistivity goes as temperature squared in the limit of zero
temperature. However, the observations of strange metal states in various
quantum materials, notably high-temperature superconductors, bring this
spectacularly successful theoretical framework into crisis. When electron
scattering rate 1/{\tau} hits its limit, kBT/{\hbar} where {\hbar} is the
reduced Planck's constant, T represents absolute temperature and kB denotes
Boltzmann's constant, Planckian dissipation occurs and lends strange metals a
surprising link to black holes, gravity, and quantum information theory. Here,
we show the characteristic signature of strange metallicity arising
unprecedentedly in a bosonic system. Our nanopatterned YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta}(YBCO)
film arrays reveal T-linear resistance as well as B-linear magnetoresistance
over an extended temperature and magnetic field range in a quantum critical
region in the phase diagram. Moreover, the slope of the T-linear resistance
{\alpha}_cp appears bounded by {\alpha}_cp {\approx} h/2e^2 [1/T]_c^onset where
T_c^onset is the temperature at which Cooper pairs form, intimating a common
scale-invariant transport mechanism corresponding to Planckian dissipation.In
contrast to fermionic systems where the temperature and magnetic field
dependent scattering rates combine in quadrature of {\hbar}/{\tau} {\approx}
{\sqrt} (((k_B T)^2+({\mu}_B B)^2)), both terms linearly combine in the present
bosonic system, i.e. {\hbar}/{\tau} {\approx} (k_B T+[{\gamma}{\mu}]_B B),
where {\gamma} is a constant. By extending the reach of strange metal
phenomenology to a bosonic system, our results suggest that there is a
fundamental principle governing their transport which transcends particle
statistics.

systems. It serves as a key input to transportation planning, roadway design,
and traffic signal control. However, the traffic volume data collected by
fixed-location sensors, such as loop detectors, often suffer from the missing
data problem and low coverage problem. The missing data problem could be caused
by hardware malfunction. The low coverage problem is due to the limited
coverage of fixed-location sensors in the transportation network, which
restrains our understanding of the traffic at the network level. To tackle
these problems, we propose a probabilistic model for traffic volume
reconstruction by fusing fixed-location sensor data and probe vehicle data. We
apply the probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) to capture the
correlations in traffic volume data. An innovative contribution of this work is
that we also integrate probe vehicle data into the framework, which allows the
model to solve both of the above-mentioned two problems. Using a real-world
traffic volume dataset, we show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for the extensively studied missing data problem.
Moreover, for the low coverage problem, which cannot be handled by most
existing methods, the proposed model can also achieve high accuracy. The
experiments also show that even when the missing ratio reaches 80%, the
proposed method can still give an accurate estimate of the unknown traffic
volumes with only a 10% probe vehicle penetration rate. The results validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model and demonstrate its
potential for practical applications.

learning-based interpretation method to deepen our knowledge of implicit bias.
Specifically, we verify that classifiers learn to make predictions based on

rendering, imaging, geometric modeling, and simulation. Compared to traditional
representations such as meshes, point clouds, or volumes they can be flexibly
incorporated into differentiable learning-based pipelines. While recent
improvements to neural representations now make it possible to represent
signals with fine details at moderate resolutions (e.g., for images and 3D
shapes), adequately representing large-scale or complex scenes has proven a
challenge. Current neural representations fail to accurately represent images
at resolutions greater than a megapixel or 3D scenes with more than a few
hundred thousand polygons. Here, we introduce a new hybrid implicit-explicit
network architecture and training strategy that adaptively allocates resources
during training and inference based on the local complexity of a signal of
interest. Our approach uses a multiscale block-coordinate decomposition,
similar to a quadtree or octree, that is optimized during training. The network
architecture operates in two stages: using the bulk of the network parameters,
a coordinate encoder generates a feature grid in a single forward pass. Then,
hundreds or thousands of samples within each block can be efficiently evaluated
using a lightweight feature decoder. With this hybrid implicit-explicit network
architecture, we demonstrate the first experiments that fit gigapixel images to
nearly 40 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio. Notably this represents an increase in
scale of over 1000x compared to the resolution of previously demonstrated
image-fitting experiments. Moreover, our approach is able to represent 3D
shapes significantly faster and better than previous techniques; it reduces
training times from days to hours or minutes and memory requirements by over an

understanding the stability of their underlying oceans as it controls the rate
at which heat can be transported outward and radiated to space. Future
spacecraft exploration of the ocean worlds (e.g., by NASA's Europa Clipper
mission) will allow for higher-resolution measurements of gravity and shape
than currently available.
  In this paper, we study the sensitivity of gravity-topography admittance to
the structure of icy shells in preparation for future data analysis. An
analytical viscous relaxation model is used to predict admittance spectra given
different shell structures determined by the temperature-dependent viscosity of
a tidally heated, conductive shell. We apply these methods to the ocean worlds
of Europa and Enceladus. We find that admittance is sensitive to the mechanisms
of topography support at different wavelengths and estimate the required
gravity performance to resolve transitions between these mechanisms. We find
that the Airy isostatic model is unable to accurately describe admittance
universally across all wavelengths when the shell thickness is a significant
fraction of body's radius. Our models suggest that measurements of admittance
at low spherical harmonic degrees are more sensitive to thick shells with high
tidal dissipation, and may complement ice-penetrating radar measurements in
constraining shell thickness. Finally, we find that admittance may be used to
constrain the tidal dissipation within the icy shell, which would be
complementary to a more demanding measurement of the tidal phase lag.

(typically $\lesssim 1$ $\mu$m in current experiments), the ABS localization
length is comparable to the length of the nanowire. The probability density of

therefore trained to undo downscaling and do not generalize to super-resolving
real-world images. Several recent publications present techniques for improving
the generalization of learning-based SR, but are all ill-suited for real-time
application.
  We present a novel approach to synthesizing training data by simulating two
digital-camera image-capture processes at different scales. Our method produces
image-pairs in which both images have properties of natural images. Training an
SR model using this data leads to far better generalization to real-world
images and videos.
  In addition, deep video-SR models are characterized by a high
operations-per-pixel count, which prohibits their application in real-time. We
present an efficient CNN architecture, which enables real-time application of
video SR on low-power edge-devices. We split the SR task into two sub-tasks: a
control-flow which estimates global properties of the input video and adapts
the weights and biases of a processing-CNN that performs the actual processing.
Since the process-CNN is tailored to the statistics of the input, its capacity
kept low, while retaining effectivity. Also, since video-statistics evolve
slowly, the control-flow operates at a much lower rate than the video
frame-rate. This reduces the overall computational load by as much as two
orders of magnitude. This framework of decoupling the adaptivity of the
algorithm from the pixel processing, can be applied in a large family of
real-time video enhancement applications, e.g., video denoising, local

sensitivity to addition of individual particles which can be used for sensing
applications. Using a coupled dipole model we investigate how multiple
scattering can enhance field perturbations arising in such random scattering
based sensors. Three distinct families of multiple scattering paths are shown
to contribute and the corresponding complex enhancement factors derived.
Probability distributions of individual enhancement factors over the complex
plane are characterised numerically within the context of surface plasmon
polariton scattering in which absorption is shown to play an important role. We
show that enhancements become more strongly dependent on individual scatterer
properties when absorption losses are larger, however, amplitude enhancements
$\sim 10^2$, comparable to low loss surface plasmons, are achievable through
sensor optimisation. Approximate analytic expressions for the complex mean
enhancements are also found, which agree well with simulations when loop
contributions are negligible.

  Transmission Grid",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a bilevel attacker-defender problem to find the worst-case attack
on the relays that control the transmission grid. The attacker maximizes load
shed by infiltrating a number of relays and rendering the components connected
to them inoperable. The defender responds by minimizing the load shed,
re-dispatching using a DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problem on the remaining
network. Though worst-case interdiction problems on the transmission grid are
well-studied, there remains a need for exact and scalable methods. Methods
based on using duality on the inner problem rely on the bounds of the dual
variables of the defender problem in order to reformulate the bilevel problem
as a mixed integer linear problem. Valid dual bounds tend to be large,
resulting in weak linear programming relaxations and making the problem
difficult to solve at scale. Often smaller heuristic bounds are used, resulting
in a lower bound. In this work we also consider a lower bound, where instead of
bounding the dual variables, we drop the constraints corresponding to Ohm's
law, relaxing DCOPF to capacitated network flow. We present theoretical results
showing that, for uncongested networks, approximating DCOPF with network flow
yields the same set of injections, which suggests that this restriction likely
gives a high-quality lower bound in the uncongested case. Furthermore, we show
that in the network flow relaxation of the defender problem, the duals are
bounded by 1, so we can solve our restriction exactly. Last, we see empirically
that this formulation scales well computationally. Through experiments on 16
networks with up to 6468 buses, we find that this bound is almost always as
tight as we can get from guessing the dual bounds, even for congested networks.
In addition, calculating the bound is approximately 150 times faster than
achieving the same bound with the reformulation guessing the dual bounds.

  Replacement Paths",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most basic graph problems, All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) is
known to be solvable in $n^{3-o(1)}$ time, and it is widely open whether it has
an $O(n^{3-\epsilon})$ time algorithm for $\epsilon > 0$. To better understand
APSP, one often strives to obtain subcubic time algorithms for structured
instances of APSP and problems equivalent to it, such as the Min-Plus matrix
product.
  A natural structured version of Min-Plus product is Monotone Min-Plus product
which has been studied in the context of the Batch Range Mode [SODA'20] and
Dynamic Range Mode [ICALP'20] problems. This paper improves the known
algorithms for Monotone Min-Plus Product and for Batch and Dynamic Range Mode,
and establishes a connection between Monotone Min-Plus Product and the Single
Source Replacement Paths (SSRP) problem on an $n$-vertex graph with potentially
negative edge weights in $\{-M, \ldots, M\}$.
  SSRP with positive integer edge weights bounded by $M$ can be solved in
$\tilde{O}(Mn^\omega)$ time, whereas the prior fastest algorithm for graphs
with possibly negative weights [FOCS'12] runs in $O(M^{0.7519} n^{2.5286})$
time, the current best running time for directed APSP with small integer
weights. Using Monotone Min-Plus Product, we obtain an improved $O(M^{0.8043}
n^{2.4957})$ time SSRP algorithm, showing that SSRP with constant negative
integer weights is likely easier than directed unweighted APSP, a problem that
is believed to require $n^{2.5-o(1)}$ time.
  Complementing our algorithm for SSRP, we give a reduction from the
Bounded-Difference Min-Plus Product problem studied by Bringmann et al.
[FOCS'16] to negative weight SSRP. This reduction shows that it might be
difficult to obtain an $\tilde{O}(M n^{\omega})$ time algorithm for SSRP with
negative weight edges, thus separating the problem from SSRP with only positive
weight edges.

approximation ratio is $1.406$ by Bansal and Khan [SODA'14]. A well-studied
variant of the problem is Guillotine Two-dimensional Bin Packing (G2BP), where
all rectangles must be packed in such a way that every rectangle in the packing
can be obtained by recursively applying a sequence of end-to-end axis-parallel
cuts, also called guillotine cuts. Bansal, Lodi, and Sviridenko [FOCS'05]
obtained an APTAS for this problem. Let $\lambda$ be the smallest constant such

G2BP for $I$ is upper bounded by $\lambda\operatorname{opt}(I) + c$, where
$\operatorname{opt}(I)$ is the number of bins in the optimal solution to 2BP

According to convention, for a given constant $\delta>0$, a rectangle is large
if both its height and width are at least $\delta$, and otherwise it is called
skewed. We make progress towards the conjecture by showing $\lambda = 4/3$ for
skewed instance, i.e., when all input rectangles are skewed. Even for this
case, the previous best upper bound on $\lambda$ was roughly 1.692. We also
give an APTAS for 2BP for skewed instance, though general 2BP does not admit an

differential conductance at zero temperature of the normal-metal lead peaks at
$2e^{2}/h$, which will be deflected after Majorana braiding. This quantized
conductance can entirely arise from the Majorana-induced crossed Andreev
reflection, protected by the energy gap of the superconducting lead. We find
that the effect of thermal broadening is significantly suppressed when the dot
is on resonance. In the case that the energy level of the quantum dot is much
larger than the superconducting gap, tunneling processes are dominated by
Majorana-induced crossed Andreev reflection. Particularly, a novel kind of

principle of chirp spread spectrum (CSS). While extensive research has been
conducted on improving various aspects of LoRa transmitter, the design of LoRa
receivers that can operate under practical conditions of timing and frequency
offsets is missing. To fill this gap, this paper develops and presents detailed
designs of timing, frequency and phase synchronization circuits for both
non-coherent and coherent detection of CSS signals. More importantly, the
proposed receiver can be used to detect the recently proposed CSS-based
modulation that embeds extra information bits in the starting phases of
conventional CSS symbols. Such a transmission scheme, referred to as
phase-shift keying CSS (PSK-CSS) helps to improve the transmission rates of the
conventional CSS system. In particular, it is shown that the bit error rate
performance of the PSK-CSS scheme achieved with the proposed practical coherent
receiver has only 0.25 dB gaps as compared to the ideal co-coherent receiver.

anatomical structure are required to present different pathological information
from the physical level for diagnostic needs. However, it is often difficult to
obtain full-sequence MRI images of patients owing to limitations such as time
consumption and high cost. The purpose of this work is to develop an algorithm
for target MRI sequences prediction with high accuracy, and provide more
information for clinical diagnosis. Methods: We propose a deep learning based
multi-modal computing model for MRI synthesis with feature disentanglement
strategy. To take full advantage of the complementary information provided by
different modalities, multi-modal MRI sequences are utilized as input. Notably,
the proposed approach decomposes each input modality into modality-invariant
space with shared information and modality-specific space with specific
information, so that features are extracted separately to effectively process
the input data. Subsequently, both of them are fused through the adaptive
instance normalization (AdaIN) layer in the decoder. In addition, to address
the lack of specific information of the target modality in the test phase, a
local adaptive fusion (LAF) module is adopted to generate a modality-like
pseudo-target with specific information similar to the ground truth. Results:
To evaluate the synthesis performance, we verify our method on the BRATS2015
dataset of 164 subjects. The experimental results demonstrate our approach
significantly outperforms the benchmark method and other state-of-the-art
medical image synthesis methods in both quantitative and qualitative measures.
Compared with the pix2pixGANs method, the PSNR improves from 23.68 to 24.8.
Conclusion: The proposed method could be effective in prediction of target MRI
sequences, and useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

of regular flow of CREs in the jet spine and acceleration at a hotspot followed
by a settling backflow. However, unstable jets create complex shock structures
at the jet-head (kink instability), the jet spine-cocoon interface and the
cocoon itself (Kelvin-Helmholtz modes). CREs after exiting jet-head undergo
further shock crossings in such scenarios and are re-accelerated in the cocoon.
CREs with different trajectories in turbulent cocoons have different
evolutionary history with different spectral parameters. Thus at the same
spatial location, there is mixing of different CRE populations, resulting in a
complex total CRE spectrum when averaged over a given area. Cocoons of unstable
jets can have an excess build up of energetic electrons due to re-acceleration
at turbulence driven shocks and slowed expansion of the decelerated jet. This
will add to the non-thermal energy budget of the cocoon.

with adaptive network structures. Here, we present a single approach to both of
these problems in the form of ""KuraNet"", a deep-learning-based system of
coupled oscillators that can learn to synchronize across a distribution of
disordered network conditions. The key feature of the model is the replacement
of the traditionally static couplings with a coupling function which can learn
optimal interactions within heterogeneous oscillator populations. We apply our
approach to the eponymous Kuramoto model and demonstrate how KuraNet can learn
data-dependent coupling structures that promote either global or cluster
synchrony. For example, we show how KuraNet can be used to empirically explore
the conditions of global synchrony in analytically impenetrable models with
disordered natural frequencies, external field strengths, and interaction
delays. In a sequence of cluster synchrony experiments, we further show how
KuraNet can function as a data classifier by synchronizing into coherent
assemblies. In all cases, we show how KuraNet can generalize to both new data
and new network scales, making it easy to work with small systems and form
hypotheses about the thermodynamic limit. Our proposed learning-based approach
is broadly applicable to arbitrary dynamical systems with wide-ranging
relevance to modeling in physics and systems biology.

official transcripts of all their allocution, this paper illustrates the
stylistic evolution and presents the underlying main trends. This study shows
that de Gaulle's rhetoric is not mainly dedicated to his own person, or that
the two terms of J. Chirac are not fully similar. According to several overall
stylistic indicators, Macron's style does not appear as complex compared to his
predecessors (F. Hollande or N. Sarkozy) but a more careful analysis clearly
demonstrates his noticeable new style. Compared to the recent US presidents,
the French ones present some similarities (e.g., similar mean sentence length)
and dissimilarities (more I-words, less we-words). In this comparative
analysis, Macron's style is also clearly distinctive from both the US and
former French presidents. Opting for a more abstract discourse, less anchored
in space, using less numbers, E. Macron tends to use long sentences. These
various stylistic and rhetorical features could explain his being misunderstood
by the French people and his recurrent low approval ratings.

introduction of a new technological solution. This paper proposes to go beyond
the concept of system requirements and stakeholders' goals, and raise the
degree of abstraction by focusing on the notions of drivers, barriers and

Furthermore, we suggest to narrow the perspective to a single domain, as the
effect of a technology is context-dependent. To put this vision into practice,
we interview 30 cross-disciplinary experts in the representative domain of
rural areas, and we analyse the transcripts to identify common themes. As a
result, we provide drivers, barriers and positive or negative impacts

This RE-relevant information could hardly be identified if interested
stakeholders were interviewed before the development of a single specific
system. This paper contributes to the literature with a fresh perspective on
sustainability requirements, and with a domain-specific framework grounded on
experts' opinions. The conceptual framework resulting from our analysis can be
used as a reference baseline for requirements elicitation endeavours in rural

formalize them. Most existing deontic logics lack corresponding algorithms and
system models that permit automatic verification. We demonstrate how a
particular deontic logic, Dominance Act Utilitarianism (DAU), is a suitable
starting point for formalizing the obligations of autonomous systems like
self-driving cars. We demonstrate its usefulness by formalizing a subset of
Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) in DAU; RSS is an industrial proposal for
how self-driving cars should and should not behave in traffic. We show that
certain logical consequences of RSS are undesirable, indicating a need to
further refine the proposal. We also demonstrate how obligations can change
over time, which is necessary for long-term autonomy. We then demonstrate a
model-checking algorithm for DAU formulas on weighted transition systems, and
illustrate it by model-checking obligations of a self-driving car controller

combines static and dynamic analysis to detect Denial of Service (DoS)

framework, SmartScan, statically scans smart contracts under test (SCUTs) to
identify patterns that are potentially vulnerable in these SCUTs and then uses
dynamic analysis to precisely confirm their exploitability of the
DoS-Unexpected Revert vulnerability, thus achieving increased performance and
more precise results. We evaluated SmartScan on a set of 500 smart contracts

packed objects using a combination of robotic pushing and grasping actions.
Object retrieval in dense clutter is an important skill for robots to operate
in households and everyday environments effectively. The proposed solution,
Visual Foresight Trees (VFT), intelligently rearranges the clutter surrounding
a target object so that it can be grasped easily. Rearrangement with nested
nonprehensile actions is challenging as it requires predicting complex object
interactions in a combinatorially large configuration space of multiple
objects. We first show that a deep neural network can be trained to accurately
predict the poses of the packed objects when the robot pushes one of them. The
predictive network provides visual foresight and is used in a tree search as a
state transition function in the space of scene images. The tree search returns
a sequence of consecutive push actions yielding the best arrangement of the
clutter for grasping the target object. Experiments in simulation and using a
real robot and objects show that the proposed approach outperforms model-free
techniques as well as model-based myopic methods both in terms of success rates

composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms were
recently tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value
transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation
of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In
the seminal GSLW'19 paper on QSVT [Gily\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe, ACM STOC

methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here,
we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first
illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum
eigenvalue transform, from which QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19,
we then employ QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase

eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates
how QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms,

contact with the well studied bi-variate moment problem, which in various

non-trivial constraints on the UV spectrum. In particular, permutation
invariance for identical scalar scattering requires that any UV completion

centers in diamond represent a promising and versatile platform for the
development of a wide range of chemical and biological sensors. This goal can
be accomplished by the placement of chemically active, spin (electron or
nuclear) labeled moiety on the surface in the close vicinity of a shallow
single paramagnetic center. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Forster
Resonant Excitation Transfer driven process where luminescent center plays a
role of excitation donor can accomplish such a goal with high chemical
efficiency, positionally precise and a scalable manner. We obtain the
probability distribution function of the sensing group position relative to the
luminescent center (NV center) and demonstrate that the functionalization
position uncertainty is equal to the luminescent center deposition depth. The
efficiency of the FRET process is analyzed as a function of the luminescent
center deposition depth and the density of the excitation acceptor sites.
Employing the geometric information of the surface-functionalized sensing
groups, we obtain the probability distribution function of the energy gap in
the spectrum of a spin-based detection system. This information allows us to
estimate the single-molecule detection capabilities of the proposed system.

thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they
represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field,
which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these
representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we
introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based
on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human
skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation
correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can
regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend
weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new
deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our
approach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods. The code and

these inferred values are mostly dominated by the combined astrophysical

anthropic window where the decay constant is around the GUT scale and the
initial misalignment angle has to be tuned close to zero. In this paper we
revisit this statement by studying the statistics of axion physics in the
string landscape. We take moduli stabilisation properly into account since the
stabilisation of the saxions is crucial to determine the physical properties of
the corresponding axionic partners. We focus on the model-independent case of
closed string axions in type IIB flux compactifications and find that their
decay constants and mass spectrum feature a logarithmic, instead of a
power-law, distribution. In the regime where the effective field theory is
under control, most of these closed string axions are ultra-light axion-like
particles, while axions associated to blow-up modes can naturally play the role
of the QCD axion. Hence, the number of type IIB flux vacua with a closed string
QCD axion with an intermediate scale decay constant and a natural value of the
misalignment angle is only logarithmically suppressed. In a recent paper we
found that this correlates also with a logarithmic distribution of the
supersymmetry breaking scale, providing the intriguing indication that most, if
not all, of the phenomenologically interesting quantities in the string
landscape might feature a logarithmic distribution.

subpopulations is the prevalence of widely spaced, equal-mass binaries in the
CCB and a much smaller but non-zero number in the HCB. The primary reason for
this difference in binary rate remains unclear. Here using N-body simulations
we examine whether close encounters with the giant planets during an early
outer solar system instability may have disrupted primordial Kuiper Belt
binaries that existed within the primordial Kuiper belt before they attained
HCB orbits. We find that such encounters are very effective at disrupting
binaries down to separations of ~1% of their Hill radius (as measured in the
modern Kuiper belt), potentially explaining the paucity of widely spaced, equal
mass binaries in the modern HCB. Moreover, we find that the widest binaries
observed in the modern HCB are quite unlikely to survive planetary encounters,
but these same planetary encounters can widen a small subset of tighter
binaries to give rise to the small population of very wide binaries seen in
today's HCB.

candidate for a large-scale quantum computer. Despite long coherence times,
achieving uniform magnetic control remains a hurdle for scale-up due to
challenges in high-frequency magnetic field control at the nanometre-scale.
Here, we present a proposal for a flopping-mode electric dipole spin resonance
qubit based on the combined electron and nuclear spin states of a double
phosphorus donor quantum dot. The key advantage of utilising a donor-based
system is that we can engineer the number of donor nuclei in each quantum dot.
By creating multi-donor dots with antiparallel nuclear spin states and
multi-electron occupation we can minimise the longitudinal magnetic field
gradient, known to couple charge noise into the device and dephase the qubit.
We describe the operation of the qubit and show that by minimising the
hyperfine interaction of the nuclear spins we can achieve $\pi/2-X$ gate error
rates of $\sim 10^{-4}$ using realistic noise models. We highlight that the low
charge noise environment in these all-epitaxial phosphorus-doped silicon qubits
will facilitate the realisation of strong coupling of the qubit to
superconducting microwave cavities allowing for long-distance two-qubit
operations.

range of physical explanations for their diverse architectures. However,
constraining formation processes requires mapping the observed exoplanet
population to that which initially formed in the protoplanetary disc. Numerous
results suggest that (internal or external) dynamical perturbation alters the
architectures of some exoplanetary systems. Isolating planets that have evolved
without any perturbation can help constrain formation processes. We consider
the Kepler multiples, which have low mutual inclinations and are unlikely to
have been dynamically perturbed. We apply a modelling approach similar to that
of Mulders et al. (2018), additionally accounting for the two-dimensionality of
the radius ($R =0.3-20\,R_\oplus$) and period ($P= 0.5-730$ days) distribution.
We find that an upper limit in planet mass of the form $M_{\rm{lim}} \propto
a^\beta \exp(-a_{\rm{in}}/a)$, for semi-major axis $a$ and a broad range of
$a_{\rm{in}}$ and $\beta$, can reproduce a distribution of $P$, $R$ that is
indistinguishable from the observed distribution by our comparison metric. The
index is consistent with $\beta= 1.5$, expected if growth is limited by
accretion within the Hill radius. This model is favoured over models assuming a
separable PDF in $P$, $R$. The limit, extrapolated to longer periods, is
coincident with the orbits of RV-discovered planets ($a>0.2$ au,
$M>1\,M_{\rm{J}}$) around recently identified low density host stars, hinting
at isolation mass limited growth. We discuss the necessary circumstances for a
coincidental age-related bias as the origin of this result, concluding that
such a bias is possible but unlikely. We conclude that, in light of the
evidence that some planetary systems have been dynamically perturbed, simple
models for planet growth during the formation stage are worth revisiting.

families. Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subvarieties of a projective or
affine space, a collection $\mathcal{H}$ of projective or affine $k$-subspaces
is $(\mathcal{F},\epsilon)$-evasive if for every $\mathcal{V}\in\mathcal{F}$,
all but at most $\epsilon$-fraction of $W\in\mathcal{H}$ intersect every
irreducible component of $\mathcal{V}$ with (at most) the expected dimension.
The problem of constructing such an explicit subspace family generalizes both
deterministic black-box polynomial identity testing (PIT) and the problem of
constructing explicit (weak) lossless rank condensers.
  Using Chow forms, we construct explicit $k$-subspace families of polynomial
size that are evasive for all varieties of bounded degree in a projective or
affine $n$-space. As one application, we obtain a complete derandomization of
Noether's normalization lemma for varieties of low degree in a projective or
affine $n$-space. In another application, we obtain a simple polynomial-time
black-box PIT algorithm for depth-4 arithmetic circuits with bounded top fan-in
and bottom fan-in that are not in the Sylvester-Gallai configuration, improving
and simplifying a result of Gupta (ECCC TR 14-130).
  As a complement of our explicit construction, we prove a tight lower bound
for the size of $k$-subspace families that are evasive for degree-$d$ varieties
in a projective $n$-space. When $n-k=n^{\Omega(1)}$, the lower bound is
superpolynomial unless $d$ is bounded. The proof uses a dimension-counting
argument on Chow varieties that parametrize projective subvarieties.

any target shape (at scale factor 2), and from a genome assembly creates
infinite copies of the genome as well as the target shape. An input target

to form a genome encoding it, which will then replicate and also initiate the
growth of copies of assemblies of the target shape. Since the lengths of the

AGN-driven quenching is challenging to reconcile with observations that AGN
hosts tend to harbour equal (or even excess) amounts of gas compared with
inactive galaxies of similar stellar mass. In this paper, we investigate
whether AGN feedback happens on sub-galactic (kpc) scales, an effect that might
be difficult to detect with global gas measurements. Using kpc-scale
measurements of molecular gas (Sigma_H2) and stellar mass (Sigma_*) surface
densities taken from the EDGE-CALIFA survey, we show that the gas fractions of
central AGN regions are typically a factor of ~2 lower than in star-forming
regions. Based on four galaxies with the best spaxel statistics, the difference
between AGN and star-forming gas fractions is seen even within a given galaxy,
indicating that AGN feedback is able to deplete the molecular gas reservoir in
the central few kpc.

benefits in terms of yield as well as economies of scale, as chiplets may come
from various third-party vendors, and be integrated into one sophisticated

challenges for the system's security and integrity when many third-party

  Here, we explore these challenges, but also promises, for modern

introduce a new, coherence-based attack, GETXspy, wherein a single compromised
chiplet can expose a high-bandwidth side/covert-channel in an ostensibly secure

Second, we propose using an active interposer as generic,
secure-by-construction platform that forms a physical root of trust for modern
2.5D systems. Our scheme has limited overhead, restricted to the active
interposer, allowing the chiplets and the coherence system to remain untouched.
We show that our scheme prevents a wide range of attacks, including but not
limited to our GETXspy attack, with little overhead on system performance,
$\sim$4\%. This overhead reduces as workloads increase, ensuring scalability of

au, $e=0.27\pm0.1$, and $P=7.7\pm0.2$ yr, which is about half of a previously
reported orbital period. The binary orbital plane is proposed to be near
coplanar to the circumbinary disk plane (with a mutual inclination of only
$\Delta=8\pm4.2$ deg; another solution with $\Delta=113$ deg is less likely
given the short re-alignment timescale). An asymmetric dust disk ring peaking
at a radius of 0.''2 is detected at 1.3 mm and its fainter counterparts are
also detected at the longer 8 and 9.8 mm. The CO gas disk, though dominated by
Keplerian rotation, presents a mild inner and outer disk misalignment, such
that the inner disk to the SW and outer disk to the NE appear brighter than
their counterparts at the opposite disk sides. The radial extension of the
disk, its asymmetric dust ring, and the presence of a disk warp could all be
explained by the interaction between the eccentric binary and the circumbinary
disk, which we assume were formed with non-zero mutual inclination. Some
tentatively detected gas spirals in the outer disk are likely produced by
interactions with the low mass tertiary component located 4'' to the northeast.
Our analyses demonstrate the promising usage of V892 Tau as an excellent
benchmark system to study the details of binary--disk interactions.

communicate the local gradient to helper nodes which relay these messages to
the central node after possible aggregation. Recently, schemes using repetition
codes and maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes, respectively known as Aligned
MDS Coding (AMC) scheme and Aligend Repetition Coding (ARC) scheme, were
proposed. It was observed that in AMC scheme the communication between edge
nodes and helper nodes is optimal but with an increased cost of communication
between helper and master. An upper bound on the communication cost between
helpers and master was obtained. In this paper, a tradeoff between
communication costs at edge nodes and helper nodes is established with the help
of pyramid codes, a well-known class of locally repairable codes. The
communication costs at both the helper nodes and edge nodes are exactly
characterized. Using the developed technique, the exact communication cost at
helper nodes can be computed for the scheme using MDS codes. In the end, we
provide two improved aggregation strategies for the existing AMC and ARC

charge is observed to result in a larger blue shift of the OH stretch, quenches
the intensity of the collective translational mode, and increases the

  the 2021 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS)",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Several emerging PoW blockchain protocols rely on a ""parallel-chain""
architecture for scaling, where instead of a single chain, multiple chains are
run in parallel and aggregated. A key requirement of practical PoW blockchains
is to adapt to mining power variations over time. In this paper, we consider
the design of provably secure parallel-chain protocols which can adapt to such
mining power variations.
  The Bitcoin difficulty adjustment rule adjusts the difficulty target of block
mining periodically to get a constant mean inter-block time. While
superficially simple, the rule has proved itself to be sophisticated and
successfully secure, both in practice and in theory. We show that natural
adaptations of the Bitcoin adjustment rule to the parallel-chain case open the
door to subtle, but catastrophic safety and liveness breaches. We uncover a
meta-design principle that allow us to design variable mining difficulty
protocols for three popular PoW blockchain proposals (Prism, OHIE, and
Fruitchains) inside a common rubric.
  The principle has three components:(M1) a pivot chain, based on which blocks
in all chains choose difficulty, (M2) a monotonicity condition for referencing
pivot chain blocks and (M3) translating additional protocol aspects from using
levels (depth) to using ""difficulty levels"". We show that protocols employing a
subset of these principles may have catastrophic failures. The security of the
designs is also proved using a common rubric - the key technical challenge
involves analyzing the interaction between the pivot chain and the other
chains, as well as bounding the sudden changes in difficulty target experienced
in non-pivot chains. We empirically investigate the responsivity of the new
mining difficulty rule via simulations based on historical Bitcoin data, and
find that the protocol very effectively controls the forking rate across all
the chains.

perpendicular to the surface) components of velocity. To compare our results
with the observations we degrade the simulation data with Gaussian kernels
having FWHM of 100 km and 200 km, and calculate horizontally averaged power
spectra for the vertical component of velocity. The power spectra of the
longitudinal component of velocity, averaged over field lines in the core of a
kG magnetic flux concentration, reveal that the dominant period of oscillations
shifts from around 6.5 minutes in the photosphere to around 4 minutes in the
chromosphere. At the same time, the velocity power spectra, averaged
horizontally over the whole domain, show that low frequency waves
(approximately 6.5 minute period) may reach well into the chromosphere.
Importantly, waves with frequencies above 5 mHz propagating along different
field lines are found to be out of phase with each other even within a single
magnetic concentration. The horizontally averaged power spectra of the vertical
component of velocity at various effective resolutions show that the observed
acoustic wave energy fluxes are underestimated, by a factor of three even if
determined from observations carried out at a high spatial resolution of 200

emerging from the Hamiltonian formulation of a metric f(R) gravity, viewed in

the Hamiltonian constraint before quantizing and adopting like a relational
time the non-minimally coupled scalar field emerging in the Jordan frame. The
resulting Schr\""oedinger evolution is then investigated both in the vacuum and
in the presence of a massless scalar field, though as the kinetic component of
an inflaton. We show that, in vacuum, the morphology of localized wave packets
is that of a non-spreading profile up to the cosmological singularity. When the
external scalar field is included into the dynamics, we see that the wave
packets acquire the surprising feature of increasing localization of the
universe volume, as it expands. This result suggests that in the metric f(R)
formulation of gravity, a spontaneous mechanism arises for the universe
classicization. Actually, when the phase space of the scalar field is fully
explored, such an increasing localization in the Universe volume is valid up to
a given value of the time, i.e. of the non-minimally coupled mode after which
the wave packets spread again. We conclude our analysis by inferring that
before this critical transition age is reached, the inflationary phase could
take place, here modelled via a cosmological constant. This point of view
provides an interesting scenario for the transition from a Planckian Universe

magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs have been performed to study the

evolutionary stages in the pre-radiative epoch. Remnants of three supernova
types are considered, namely, SNIa, SNIc and SNIIP, that covers a wide space of

of spatial distributions are analysed. It is shown that the radial component of
magnetic field rapidly drops downstream of the forward shock. Therefore, the
radially-aligned polarization patterns observed in few young SNRs cannot be
reproduced in the one-dimensional MHD simulations. The period SNR takes for the
transition from the earliest ejecta-driven phase to the Sedov phase is long
enough, with its distinctive physical features, headed by the energy conversion
from mostly kinetic one to a fixed ratio between the thermal and kinetic

hardly recovers by itself. In this paper, we find CO is not only limited to
FGSM, but also happens in $\mbox{DF}^{\infty}$-1 adversarial training. Then, we
analyze the geometric properties for both FGSM and $\mbox{DF}^{\infty}$-1 and
find they have totally different decision boundaries after CO. For FGSM, a new
decision boundary is generated along the direction of perturbation and makes
the small perturbation more effective than the large one. While for
$\mbox{DF}^{\infty}$-1, there is no new decision boundary generated along the
direction of perturbation, instead the perturbation generated by
$\mbox{DF}^{\infty}$-1 becomes smaller after CO and thus loses its
effectiveness. We also experimentally analyze three hypotheses on potential
factors causing CO. And then based on the empirical analysis, we modify the

Semantics refers to the outputs (behaviour) of a GP individual when this is run

search. Surprisingly, there is minuscule research conducted in semantics in
Multi-objective GP (MOGP). In this work we make a leap beyond our understanding
of semantics in MOGP and propose SDO: Semantic-based Distance as an additional
criteriOn. This naturally encourages semantic diversity in MOGP. To do so, we
find a pivot in the less dense region of the first Pareto front (most promising
front). This is then used to compute a distance between the pivot and every

to which structural mechanisms can explain hierarchy and other network

family of adaptive rewiring network models, which reinforce institutional
prestige within the hierarchy in five distinct ways. Each mechanism determines
the probability that a new hire comes from a particular institution according
to that institution's prestige score, which is inferred from the hiring
network's existing structure. We find that structural inequalities and
centrality patterns in real hiring networks are best reproduced by a mechanism
of global placement power, in which a new hire is drawn from a particular
institution in proportion to the number of previously drawn hires anywhere. On
the other hand, network measures of biased visibility are better recapitulated
by a mechanism of local placement power, in which a new hire is drawn from a
particular institution in proportion to the number of its previous hires
already present at the hiring institution. These contrasting results suggest
that the underlying structural mechanism reinforcing hierarchies in faculty
hiring networks is a mixture of global and local preference for institutional
prestige. Under these dynamics, we show that each institution's position in the
hierarchy is remarkably stable, due to a dynamic competition that
overwhelmingly favors more prestigious institutions.

delayed fluorescence (TADF) are investi-gated by combining computational and
experimental approaches. To achieve high internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs)
in metal-free organic light emitting diode via TADF, the first triplet (T1) to
first singlet (S1) reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) is promoted by
configuring molecules in an electron donor-acceptor (D-A) alternation with a
large di-hedral angle, which results in a small energy gap ({\Delta}EST)
between S1 and T1 levels. This allows for effective non-radiative up-conversion
of triplet excitons to singlet excitons that fluoresce. However, this
traditional molecular de-sign of TADF results in broad emission spectral bands
(full-width at half-maximum = 70-100 nm). Despite reports suggesting that
suppressing the D-A dihedral rotation narrows the emission band, the origin of
emission broadening remains elusive. Indeed, our results suggest that the
intrinsic TADF emission bandwidth is primarily determined by the charge
transfer character of the molecule, rather than its propensity for rotational
motion, which offers a renewed perspective on the rational molecular design of
organic emitters exhibiting sharp emission spectra.

where consumers and producers may have different objectives. Conventional
recommendation systems, however, mainly focus on maximizing consumers'
satisfaction by recommending the most relevant items to each individual. This
may result in unfair exposure of items, thus jeopardizing producer benefits.
Additionally, they do not care whether consumers from diverse demographic
groups are equally satisfied. To address these limitations, we propose a
multi-objective optimization framework for fairness-aware recommendation,
Multi-FR, that adaptively balances accuracy and fairness for various
stakeholders with Pareto optimality guarantee. We first propose four fairness
constraints on consumers and producers. In order to train the whole framework
in an end-to-end way, we utilize the smooth rank and stochastic ranking policy
to make these fairness criteria differentiable and friendly to
back-propagation. Then, we adopt the multiple gradient descent algorithm to
generate a Pareto set of solutions, from which the most appropriate one is
selected by the Least Misery Strategy. The experimental results demonstrate
that Multi-FR largely improves recommendation fairness on multiple stakeholders
over the state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining almost the same
recommendation accuracy. The training efficiency study confirms our model's
ability to simultaneously optimize different fairness constraints for many
stakeholders efficiently.

propagation of chaos for a wide class of mean field diffusive dynamics. For a
system of $n$ interacting particles, the relative entropy between the marginal
law of $k$ particles and its limiting product measure is shown to be
$O((k/n)^2)$ at each time, as long as the same is true at time zero. A simple
Gaussian example shows that this rate is optimal. The main assumption is that
the limiting measure obeys a certain functional inequality, which is shown to
encompass many potentially irregular but not too singular finite-range
interactions, as well as some infinite-range interactions. This unifies the
previously disparate cases of Lipschitz versus bounded measurable interactions,
improving the best prior bounds of $O(k/n)$ which were deduced from global
estimates involving all $n$ particles. We also cover a class of models for
which qualitative propagation of chaos and even well-posedness of the
McKean-Vlasov equation were previously unknown. At the center of a new approach

weeks) and substantial computational resources. Such requirements significantly
limit their applicability in understanding and inverse designing structures
with desired resonance performances. Recently, the introduction of artificial

computational requirements. However, current end-to-end deep learning
approaches generally fail to predict resonances with high quality-factors

predict ultra-high Q-factor resonances by decomposing spectra with an adaptive

exploit bound states in the continuum (BICs) with an infinite Q-factor to
testify this resonance-informed deep learning (RIDL) strategy. The trained RIDL
strategy achieves high-accuracy prediction of reflection spectra and photonic
band structures while using a considerably small training dataset. We further
develop an inverse design algorithm based on the RIDL strategy for a
symmetry-protected BIC on a suspended silicon nitride photonic crystal (PhC)

monolayer $\mathrm{Fe_2IX}$ (X=Cl and Br) with dynamic, mechanical and thermal
stabilities is predict to be room-temperature PQAHI. At the absence of
spin-orbit coupling (SOC), monolayer $\mathrm{Fe_2IX}$ (X=Cl and Br) is a half
Dirac semimetal state. When the SOC is included, these monolayers become
quantum anomalous hall (QAH) states with sizable gaps (more than two hundred
meV) and two chiral edge modes (Chern number C=2). It is also found that
monolayer $\mathrm{Fe_2IX}$ (X=Cl and Br) possesses robust QAH states against
biaxial strain. By symmetry analysis, it is found that only out-of-plane
piezoelectric response can be induced by a uniaxial strain in the basal plane.
The calculated out-of-plane $d_{31}$ of $\mathrm{Fe_2ICl}$ ($\mathrm{Fe_2IBr}$)
is 0.467 pm/V (0.384 pm/V), which is higher than or comparable with ones of
other 2D known materials. Meanwhile, using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, the
Curie temperature $T_C$ is estimated to be 429/403 K for monolayer
$\mathrm{Fe_2ICl}$/$\mathrm{Fe_2IBr}$ at FM ground state, which is above room
temperature. Finally, the interplay of electronic correlations with nontrivial
band topology is studied to confirm the robustness of QAH state. The
combination of piezoelectricity, topological and FM orders makes monolayer
$\mathrm{Fe_2IX}$ (X=Cl and Br) become a potential platform for
multi-functional spintronic applications with large gap and high $T_C$. Our
works provide possibility to use the piezotronic effect to control QAH effects,

training on a compositional speech corpus including many languages, resulting

the fact that each language in the training data has different characteristics,
the shared network may struggle to optimize for all various languages

targets the core operation in neural networks: linear transformation functions.
The key idea of the method is to assign fast weight matrices for each language

dependent component. The latter is then factorized into vectors using rank-1
assumptions to reduce the number of parameters per language. This efficient
factorization scheme is proved to be effective in two multilingual settings

The analogy is exact when the rate of the drift orientation vanishes and the

potential, resulting in the effective potential $u_{eff}$. The stationary
distribution is then calculated as a disorder-averaged quantity by considering
all contributing drift orientations. To extend this viewpoint to the case when
a drift orientation evolves in time, we reformulate the relevant Fokker-Planck

formulation is that it is represented in terms of the Boltzmann factor
$e^{-\beta u_{eff}}$. In the case of a run-and-tumble model, the formulation

proportionally to {\sigma}, where {\sigma} is the noise standard deviation.
Moreover, the slope is computed exactly for several distributions and it is

susceptibility measurements in order to further characterize its low
temperature behavior in the presence of a transverse field. Specifically, we
call attention to an unconventional freezing transition in zero-field below
T$_F$ = 1.2~K, occurring \emph{within} the well-known commensurate
antiferromagnetic (CAFM) state that onsets at $T_{N2}$ = 1.9~K. We performed a
series of transverse-field quenches into this frozen state, which resulted in a
slowly relaxing susceptibility, $\chi^{\prime}(t)$, that followed a logarithmic
decay within the time range measured. We discuss the frozen state in the
context of the freezing of previously discussed ""free"" chains arising from
domain walls between the four degenerate sublattices of the CAFM state. We also
attempted to observe Kibble-Zurek scaling by quenching the transverse field
into the frozen state at different rates. This produced a null result; the
behavior can be fully explained by coarsening of domains over the timescale of
the quenches. The absence of a clear Kibble-Zurek scaling is itself surprising,

transitions.

$^{10}$Be by analyzing the elastic and inelastic scatterings with a framework
combing the microscopic structure and reaction models. For studying the
structure, the $^{10}$Be nucleus was constructed under the assumption of a
four-body ($\alpha + \alpha + n + n$) cluster model. In this work, we focused
on the change in the inner structure for the 0$_1^+$, 2$_1^+$, and 2$_2^+$
states when the strength of the spin-orbit interaction is varied. The inner
structure, including various physical quantities such as energy, radius, and
transition strength, is drastically influenced by the strength of the
spin-orbit interaction. In particular, the development and breaking of the
dineutron correlation is governed by the spin-orbit strength. The differences
in the inner structure can be manifested by applying the obtained wave
functions to elastic and inelastic scatterings with a proton target at $E/A =$
59.4 and 200 MeV. Although the 0$_1^+$ and 2$_1^+$ states are significantly
influenced by the spin-orbit strength of the nuclear structure calculation, the
elastic and inelastic cross sections are not much affected. On the other hand,
the inelastic cross section of the 2$_2^+$ state depends greatly on the
spin-orbit strength of the structure calculation. Thus, we discovered a way to
measure the degree of the development of dineutron cluster structure based on
its sensitivity to the inelastic cross section of the 2$_2^+$ state of
$^{10}$Be.

huge number of casualties and security problems. In order to reduce the spread
of coronavirus, people often wear masks to protect themselves. This makes face
recognition a very difficult task since certain parts of the face are hidden. A
primary focus of researchers during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is to come
up with suggestions to handle this problem through rapid and efficient
solutions. In this paper, we propose a reliable method based on occlusion
removal and deep learning-based features in order to address the problem of the
masked face recognition process. The first step is to remove the masked face
region. Next, we apply three pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) namely, VGG-16, AlexNet, and ResNet-50, and use them to extract deep
features from the obtained regions (mostly eyes and forehead regions). The
Bag-of-features paradigm is then applied to the feature maps of the last
convolutional layer in order to quantize them and to get a slight
representation comparing to the fully connected layer of classical CNN.
Finally, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is applied for the classification process.
Experimental results on Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset show high recognition
performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

(LCS) problem. The fastest algorithm for solving the LCS problem exactly runs
in essentially quadratic time in the length of the input, and it is known that
under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis the quadratic running time cannot
be beaten. There are no such limitations for the approximate computation of the
LCS however, except in some limited scenarios. There is also a scarcity of
approximation algorithms. When the two given strings are over an alphabet of
size $k$, returning the subsequence formed by the most frequent symbol
occurring in both strings achieves a $1/k$ approximation for the LCS. It is an
open problem whether a better than $1/k$ approximation can be achieved in truly
subquadratic time ($O(n^{2-\delta})$ time for constant $\delta>0$).
  A recent result [Rubinstein and Song SODA'2020] showed that a $1/2+\epsilon$
approximation for the LCS over a binary alphabet is possible in truly
subquadratic time, provided the input strings have the same length. In this
paper we show that if a $1/2+\epsilon$ approximation (for $\epsilon>0$) is
achievable for binary LCS in truly subquadratic time when the input strings can
be unequal, then for every constant $k$, there is a truly subquadratic time
algorithm that achieves a $1/k+\delta$ approximation for $k$-ary alphabet LCS
for some $\delta>0$. Thus the binary case is the hardest. We also show that for
every constant $k$, if one is given two strings of \emph{equal} length over a
$k$-ary alphabet, one can obtain a $1/k+\epsilon$ approximation for some
constant $\epsilon>0$ in truly subquadratic time, thus extending the Rubinstein

spectral energy distribution of the LAHz galaxies over the FUV-FIR wavelength
range, and derive the SFH in five time-steps up to a look-back time of 13.3
Gyr. Of the eleven LAHz candidates, six galaxies have SFH consistent with no
star formation activity at look-back times beyond 1 Gyr. The remaining galaxies
show residual levels of star formation at ages $\gtrsim$1\,Gyr, making them
less suitable as local analogs. The six young galaxies stand out in our sample
by having the lowest gas-phase metallicities. They are characterized by warmer
dust, having the highest specific SFR, and the highest gas mass fractions. The
young age of these six galaxies suggests that merging is less important as a

assigning attention weights based on their importance. Contrastive learning can
learn better representations by keeping the instances of each class closer and
pushing away instances from different classes in the embedding space
concurrently. Furthermore, a new hybrid loss is designed to simultaneously
conduct contrastive learning and classification by integrating a supervised

repetition has several merits in training the agent, but the data between
action-decision points (i.e., intermediate frames) are, in effect, discarded.
Since the amount of training data is inversely proportional to the interval of
action repeats, they can have a negative impact on the sample efficiency of
training. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective approach to
alleviate to this problem by introducing the concept of pseudo-actions. The key
idea of our method is making the transition between action-decision points
usable as training data by considering pseudo-actions. Pseudo-actions for
continuous control tasks are obtained as the average of the action sequence
straddling an action-decision point. For discrete control tasks, pseudo-actions
are computed from learned action embeddings. This method can be combined with
any model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that involves the learning of

AdsNorm projects images from unseen target domain into the same latent space,

floating-zone-grown Nd$_{2}$Zr$_{2}$O$_{7}$ crystals, we have performed a
detailed study of the relationship between synthesis environment, structural
disorder, and magnetic properties. Using a combination of polycrystalline
standards, electron-probe microanalysis and scattering techniques, we show that
crystals grown under atmospheric conditions have a reduced lattice parameter -
relative to pristine polycrystalline powders - due to occupation of the Nd-site
by excess Zr (i.e. ""negative"" stuffing). In contrast, crystals grown under
high-pressure Ar are nearly stoichiometric with an average lattice parameter
approaching the polycrystalline value. While minimal disorder of the oxygen
sublattices is observed on the scale of the average structure, neutron
pair-distribution function analysis indicates a highly local disorder of the
oxygen coordination, which is only weakly dependent on growth environment. Most
importantly, our magnetization, heat capacity and single-crystal neutron
scattering data show that the magnetic properties of crystals grown under
high-pressure Ar match closely with those of stoichiometric powders. Neutron
scattering measurements reveal that the signature of magnetic moment
fragmentation - the coexistence of all-in-all-out (AIAO) magnetic Bragg peaks
and diffuse pinch-point scattering due to spin-ice correlations - persists in
these nearly stoichiometric crystals. However, in addition to an increased AIAO
transition temperature, the diffuse signal is seemingly stabilized and remains
nearly unchanged upon warming to 800 mK. This behavior indicates that both the
AIAO magnetic order and spin-ice correlations are sensitive to deviations of
the Nd stoichiometry.

high computational cost of the gradient-based topology optimization. These
methods typically require extensive and costly datasets for training, have a
difficult time generalizing to unseen boundary and loading conditions and to
new domains, and do not take into consideration topological constraints of the

present a deep learning method based on generative adversarial networks for
generative design exploration. The proposed method combines the generative
power of conditional GANs with the knowledge transfer capabilities of transfer
learning methods to predict optimal topologies for unseen boundary conditions.
We also show that the knowledge transfer capabilities embedded in the design of
the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the size of the training dataset
compared to the traditional deep learning neural or adversarial networks.
Moreover, we formulate a topological loss function based on the bottleneck
distance obtained from the persistent diagram of the structures and demonstrate
a significant improvement in the topological connectivity of the predicted

the proposed approach for both seen and unseen boundary conditions in 2D.

optimization algorithm. The optimization results show that all the six selected
types of TPMS lattices can be made to achieve isotropic stiffness by varying
the shell thickness, among which N14 can maintain over 90% of the
Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound of bulk modulus. All the optimized shell lattices

compression results reveal different failure deformation behaviors along
different directions. The [100] direction shows a layer-by-layer plastic

craft of payoff-relevant environmental signals solely can influence the
behaviors of intelligent agents. The agents' strategic interactions are
captured by a Markov game, in which each agent first selects one external
signal from multiple signal sources as additional payoff-relevant information
and then takes an action. There is a rational information designer (principal)
who possesses one signal source and aims to influence the equilibrium behaviors
of the agents by designing the information structure of her signals sent to the
agents. We propose a direct information design approach that incentivizes each
agent to select the signal sent by the principal, such that the design process
avoids the predictions of the agents' strategic selection behaviors. We then
introduce the design protocol given a goal of the designer which we refer to as
obedient implementability (OIL) and characterize the OIL in a class of obedient
sequential Markov perfect equilibria (O-SMPE). A design regime is proposed
based on an approach which we refer to as the fixed-point alignment that
incentivizes the agents to choose the signal sent by the principal, guarantees
that the agents' policy profile of taking actions is the policy component of an
O-SMPE and the principal's goal is achieved. We then formulate the principal's
optimal goal selection problem in terms of information design and characterize
the optimization problem by minimizing the fixed-point misalignments. The
proposed approach can be applied to elicit desired behaviors of multi-agent
systems in competing as well as cooperating settings and be extended to
heterogeneous stochastic games in the complete- and the incomplete-information

object detection (SOD) datasets, which unrealistically assume that each image

bias has led to a saturation in performance for state-of-the-art SOD models
when evaluated on existing datasets. However, these models are still far from
satisfactory when applied to real-world scenes. Based on our analyses, we
propose a new high-quality dataset and update the previous saliency benchmark.
Specifically, our dataset, called Salient Objects in Clutter~\textbf{(SOC)},
includes images with both salient and non-salient objects from several common
object categories. In addition to object category annotations, each salient
image is accompanied by attributes that reflect common challenges in common
scenes, which can help provide deeper insight into the SOD problem. Further,
with a given saliency encoder, e.g., the backbone network, existing saliency
models are designed to achieve mapping from the training image set to the
training ground-truth set. We, therefore, argue that improving the dataset can
yield higher performance gains than focusing only on the decoder design. With
this in mind, we investigate several dataset-enhancement strategies, including
label smoothing to implicitly emphasize salient boundaries, random image
augmentation to adapt saliency models to various scenarios, and self-supervised
learning as a regularization strategy to learn from small datasets. Our
extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of these tricks. We also
provide a comprehensive benchmark for SOD, which can be found in our

source to be in the soft state for the first three observations and in a faint
and bright hard state for the next two. Quasi-periodic oscillations at $\sim
0.9$ and $\sim 6.9$\,Hz, belonging to the type-C and type-A class are detected.
In the soft state, the power density spectra are substantially lower (by a
factor $> 5$) for the {\it NICER} (0.5--12 keV) band compared to the {\it
AstroSat}/LAXPC (3--80 keV) one, confirming that the disk is significantly less
variable than the Comptonization component. For the first time,
energy-dependent fractional rms and time lag in the 0.5--80 keV energy band was
measured at different Fourier frequencies, using the bright hard state
observation. Hard time lag is detected for the bright hard state, while the
faint one shows evidence for soft lag. A single-zone propagation model fits the
LAXPC results in the energy band 3--80 keV with parameters similar to those
obtained for Cygnus X--1 and MAXI J1820+070. Extending the model to lower
energies, reveals qualitative similarities but having quantitative differences
with the {\it NICER} results. These discrepancies could be because the {\it
NICER} and {\it AstroSat} data are not strictly simultaneous and because the
simple propagation model does not take into account disk emission. The results
highlight the need for more joint coordinated observations of such systems by
{\it NICER} and {\it AstroSat}.

intervals quantify the uncertainty due to sampling, that is, the uncertainty
due to not observing the full population. However, sampling is not the only
source of uncertainty. In practice, distributions change between locations and
across time. This makes it difficult to gather knowledge that transfers across
data sets. We propose a measure of instability that quantifies the
distributional instability of a statistical parameter with respect to
Kullback-Leibler divergence, that is, the sensitivity of the parameter under
general distributional perturbations within a Kullback-Leibler divergence ball.
In addition, we quantify the instability of parameters with respect to
directional or variable-specific shifts. Measuring instability with respect to
directional shifts can be used to detect the type of shifts a parameter is
sensitive to. We discuss how such knowledge can inform data collection for
improved estimation of statistical parameters under shifted distributions. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed measure on real data and show that it
can elucidate the distributional instability of a parameter with respect to
certain shifts and can be used to improve estimation accuracy under shifted
distributions.

receive treatment in time and maintain eyesight. Nowadays, deep learning (DL)
based models have been successfully used for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of
glaucoma from retina fundus images. However, a DL model pre-trained using a
dataset from one hospital center may have poor performance on a dataset from
another new hospital center and therefore its applications in the real scene
are limited. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive transfer learning (SATL)
strategy to fill the domain gap between multicenter datasets. Specifically, the
encoder of a DL model that is pre-trained on the source domain is used to
initialize the encoder of a reconstruction model. Then, the reconstruction
model is trained using only unlabeled image data from the target domain, which
makes the encoder in the model adapt itself to extract useful high-level
features both for target domain images encoding and glaucoma classification,
simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SATL
strategy is effective in the domain adaptation task between one private and two
public glaucoma diagnosis datasets, i.e. pri-RFG, REFUGE, and LAG. Moreover,
the proposed strategy is completely independent of the source domain data,
which meets the real scene application and the privacy protection policy.

systematically on injected GW signals, with component masses uniformly

of more than 0.95 with pure Numerical Relativity templates for signals with
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than six, and is also robust against
interfering glitches. We then apply our model to all ten detected BBH events

schemes extending the leakage resilience of linear threshold secret sharing
schemes over prime fields done by Benhamouda et al. Since there is not any
explicit efficient construction of AG codes over prime fields, we consider
constructions over prime fields with the help of concatenation method and those
over field extensions. Extending the Fourier analysis done by Benhamouda et
al., concatenated algebraic geometric codes over prime fields do produce some
nice leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes. One natural and curious question
is whether AG codes over extension fields produce better leakage-resilient
secret sharing schemes than the construction based on concatenated AG codes.
Such construction provides several advantages compared to the construction over
prime fields using concatenation method. First, AG codes over extension fields
give secret sharing schemes with smaller reconstruction for a fixed privacy
parameter t. Second, concatenated AG codes do not enjoy strong multiplicity and
hence they are not applicable to secure MPC schemes. It is also confirmed that
indeed AG codes over extension fields have stronger leakage-resilience under
some reasonable assumptions. These three advantages strongly motivate the study
of secret sharing schemes from AG codes over extension fields. The current
paper has two main contributions: 1, we obtain leakage-resilient secret sharing
schemes with constant share sizes and unbounded numbers of players. Like Shamir
secret scheme, our schemes enjoy multiplicity and hence can be applied to MPC.
2, via a sophisticated Fourier Analysis, we analyze the leakage-resilience of
secret sharing schemes from codes over extension fields. This is of its own
theoretical interest independent of its application to secret sharing schemes
from algebraic geometric codes over extension fields.

the existence of one set of timelike observers, the co-moving Eulerian

shows that the situation is actually much grimmer than advertised -- all
physically reasonable warp drives will violate the null energy condition, and
so also automatically violate the WEC, and both the strong and dominant energy
conditions. While warp drives are certainly interesting examples of speculative
physics, the violation of the energy conditions, at least within the framework

physically reasonable warp drives will still violate the purely geometrical

the unsafe states and introduce an expected return with a state-dependent
discount factor. We compute a winning region and a directed controller with the
maximum satisfaction probability using a dynamic programming method, where the
expected return is used as a value function. Next, we construct a permissive
supervisor via the optimal value function. We show that the supervisor
accomplishes the maximum satisfaction probability and maximizes the reachable

two-stage model-free reinforcement learning method for efficient learning of
the winning region and the directed controllers with the maximum satisfaction

simulation.

degradations. The condition networks accept the condition vector (encoded
degradation information) as input, then generate modulation parameters for both
the generator and the discriminator. During testing, users can control the

They have significantly improved our understanding of how EAs escape from local
optima. However, their particular structure -- to leave the local optimum one
can only jump directly to the global optimum -- raises the question of how
representative such results are.
  For this reason, we propose an extended class $\textsc{Jump}_{k,\delta}$ of
jump functions that contain a valley of low fitness of width $\delta$ starting
at distance $k$ from the global optimum. We prove that several previous results
extend to this more general class: for all {$k \le \frac{n^{1/3}}{\ln{n}}$} and
$\delta < k$, the optimal mutation rate for the $(1+1)$~EA is
$\frac{\delta}{n}$, and the fast $(1+1)$~EA runs faster than the classical
$(1+1)$~EA by a factor super-exponential in $\delta$. However, we also observe
that some known results do not generalize: the randomized local search
algorithm with stagnation detection, which is faster than the fast $(1+1)$~EA
by a factor polynomial in $k$ on $\textsc{Jump}_k$, is slower by a factor
polynomial in $n$ on some $\textsc{Jump}_{k,\delta}$ instances.
  Computationally, the new class allows experiments with wider fitness valleys,
especially when they lie further away from the global optimum.

outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision-recall

provides the flexibility to contextually scale localization latency in order to
achieve these improvements. The improved initial localization estimate opens up
the possibility of both improved overall localization performance and modified

shortage of residents, we study the Hospitals/Residents model in which
hospitals are associated with lower quotas and the objective is to satisfy them
as much as possible. When preference lists are strict, the number of residents
assigned to each hospital is the same in any stable matching because of the
well-known rural hospitals theorem; thus there is no room for algorithmic
interventions. However, when ties are introduced to preference lists, this will
no longer apply because the number of residents may vary over stable matchings.
In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem to find a stable matching
with the maximum total satisfaction ratio for lower quotas. We first
investigate how the total satisfaction ratio varies over choices of stable
matchings in four natural scenarios and provide the exact values of these
maximum gaps. Subsequently, we propose a strategy-proof approximation algorithm
for our problem; in one scenario it solves the problem optimally, and in the
other three scenarios, which are NP-hard, it yields a better approximation
factor than that of a naive tie-breaking method. Finally, we show
inapproximability results for the above-mentioned three NP-hard scenarios.

strings $S$ and $T$, each of length at most $n$, over an alphabet of size
$\sigma$, and we are asked to find a longest string occurring as a fragment of
both $S$ and $T$. Weiner, in his seminal paper that introduced the suffix tree,
presented an $\mathcal{O}(n \log \sigma)$-time algorithm for this problem [SWAT
1973]. For polynomially-bounded integer alphabets, the linear-time construction
of suffix trees by Farach yielded an $\mathcal{O}(n)$-time algorithm for the
LCS problem [FOCS 1997]. However, for small alphabets, this is not necessarily
optimal for the LCS problem in the word RAM model of computation, in which the
strings can be stored in $\mathcal{O}(n \log \sigma/\log n )$ space and read in
$\mathcal{O}(n \log \sigma/\log n )$ time. We show that, in this model, we can
compute an LCS in time $\mathcal{O}(n \log \sigma / \sqrt{\log n})$, which is
sublinear in $n$ if $\sigma=2^{o(\sqrt{\log n})}$ (in particular, if
$\sigma=\mathcal{O}(1)$), using optimal space $\mathcal{O}(n \log \sigma/\log
n)$.
  We then lift our ideas to the problem of computing a $k$-mismatch LCS, which
has received considerable attention in recent years. In this problem, the aim
is to compute a longest substring of $S$ that occurs in $T$ with at most $k$
mismatches. Thankachan et al.~showed how to compute a $k$-mismatch LCS in
$\mathcal{O}(n \log^k n)$ time for $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$ [J. Comput. Biol. 2016].
We show an $\mathcal{O}(n \log^{k-1/2} n)$-time algorithm, for any constant
$k>0$ and irrespective of the alphabet size, using $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space as
the previous approaches. We thus notably break through the well-known $n \log^k
n$ barrier, which stems from a recursive heavy-path decomposition technique
that was first introduced in the seminal paper of Cole et al. [STOC 2004] for
string indexing with $k$ errors.

computationally expensive approximations such as sampling or variational
inference. We propose an approximate inference framework primarily designed to
be computationally cheap while still achieving high approximation quality. The
concept, which we call Laplace Matching, involves closed-form, approximate,
bi-directional transformations between the parameter spaces of exponential
families. These are constructed from Laplace approximations under
custom-designed basis transformations. The mappings can then be leveraged to
effectively turn a latent Gaussian distribution into an approximate conjugate
prior to a rich class of observable variables. This allows us to train latent
Gaussian models such as Gaussian Processes on non-Gaussian data at nearly no
additional cost. The method can be thought of as a pre-processing step which
can be implemented in <5 lines of code and runs in less than a second.
Furthermore, Laplace Matching yields a simple way to group similar data points
together, e.g. to produce inducing points for GPs. We empirically evaluate the
method with experiments for four different exponential distributions, namely
the Beta, Gamma, Dirichlet and inverse Wishart, showing approximation quality
comparable to state-of-the-art approximate inference techniques at a drastic
reduction in computational cost.

is sometimes compromised by the entrainment of an air bubble inside the ink
channel. Here, bubble pinch-off from an acoustically driven meniscus is studied
in an optically transparent DOD printhead as a function of the driving
waveform. We show that bubble pinch-off follows from low-amplitude higher-order
meniscus oscillations on top of the global high-amplitude meniscus motion that
drives droplet formation. In a certain window of control parameters, phase
inversion between the low and high frequency components leads to the enclosure
of an air cavity and bubble pinch-off. Although phenomenologically similar,
bubble pinch-off is not a result of capillary wave interaction such as observed
in drop impact on a liquid pool. Instead, we reveal geometrical flow focusing
as the mechanism through which at first, an outward jet is formed on the
retracted concave meniscus. When the subsequent high-frequency pressure wave
hits the now toroidal-shaped meniscus, it accelerates the toroidal ring outward
resulting in the formation of an air cavity that can pinch off. The critical
control parameters for pinch off are the pulse timing and amplitude. To cure
the bubble entrainment problem, the threshold for bubble pinch-off can be
increased by suppressing the high frequency acoustic waves through appropriate
waveform design. The present work therefore aids the improvement of the
stability of inkjet printers through a physical understanding of meniscus
instabilities.

global existence in critical Besov spaces. In particular, the results of global

for supporting reliable information transmission in high-mobility vehicular
networks. In this paper, we consider the employment of the integrated (radar)
sensing and communication (ISAC) technique for assisting OTFS transmission in
both uplink and downlink vehicular communication systems. Benefiting from the
OTFS-ISAC signals, the roadside unit (RSU) is capable of simultaneously
transmitting downlink information to the vehicles and estimating the sensing
parameters of vehicles, e.g., locations and speeds, based on the reflected
echoes. Then, relying on the estimated kinematic parameters of vehicles, the
RSU can construct the topology of the vehicular network that enables the
prediction of the vehicle states in the following time instant. Consequently,
the RSU can effectively formulate the transmit downlink beamformers according
to the predicted parameters to counteract the channel adversity such that the
vehicles can directly detect the information without the need of performing
channel estimation. As for the uplink transmission, the RSU can infer the
delays and Dopplers associated with different channel paths based on the
aforementioned dynamic topology of the vehicular network. Thus, inserting guard
space as in conventional methods are not needed for uplink channel estimation
which removes the required training overhead. Finally, an efficient uplink
detector is proposed by taking into account the channel estimation uncertainty.
Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed
ISAC-assisted OTFS transmission scheme.

isotones raging from Pu to No with even-$Z$ numbers, and a sharp drop in
energies was observed in Cf. Purpose: I attempt to uncover the microscopic
mechanism for the appearance of such a low-energy $2^-$ state in $^{248}$Cf.
Furthermore, I investigate the possible occurrence of the low-energy
$K^\pi=2^+$ state to elucidate the mechanism that prefers the simultaneous
breaking of the reflection and axial symmetry to the breaking of the axial
symmetry alone in this mass region. Method: I employ a nuclear EDF method: the
Skyrme-Kohn-Sham-Bogoliubov and the quasiparticle random-phase approximation
are used to describe the ground state and the transition to excited states.
Results: The Skyrme-type SkM* and SLy4 functionals reproduce the fall in
energy, but not the absolute value, of the $K^\pi=2^-$ state at $Z=98$, where
the proton 2qp excitation $[633]7/2 \otimes [521]3/2$ plays a decisive role for
the peculiar isotonic dependence. I find interweaving roles by the pairing
correlation of protons and the deformed shell closure at $Z=98$. The SkM* model
predicts the $K^\pi=2^-$ state appears lower in energy in $^{246}$Cf than in
$^{248}$Cf as the Fermi level of neutrons is located in between the $[622]5/2$
and $[734]9/2$ orbitals. Except for $^{250}$Fm in the SkM* calculation, the
$K^\pi=2^+$ state is predicted to appear higher in energy than the $K^\pi=2^-$
state because the quasi-proton $[521]1/2$ orbital is located above the
$[633]7/2$ orbital. Conclusions: A systematic study of low-lying collective
states in heavy actinide nuclei provides a rigorous testing ground for
microscopic nuclear models. The present study shows a need for improvements in
the EDFs to describe pairing correlations and shell structures in heavy nuclei,
that are indispensable in predicting the heaviest nuclei.

regimes in which quantum many-body dynamics can be efficiently solved. Here we
show that the combination of machine learning methods and complementary
many-body tensor network techniques substantially decreases the computational

polynomial techniques and real-time evolution, together with deep neural

extrapolate dynamics for many-body systems without prior knowledge.
Importantly, this algorithm is shown to be substantially resilient to numerical

its fragmentation and physical parameters with the emphasis on properties of

unstable. The density estimates obtained from the C$^{18}$O (3-2)/(2-1) and
N$_2$H$^+$ (3-2)/(1-0) intensity ratios are in the range $n \sim (0.3-3)\times
10^5$ cm$^{-2}$. The HNCO emission is detected exclusively toward the first
clump which contains the luminous IR source IRAS 17233-3606, and indicates an
even higher density. It is observed in the outflow, too. The velocity shift of
the higher excitation HNCO lines may indicate a movement of the hot core
relative the surrounding medium. In some clumps there is a velocity shift $\sim
1$ km s$^{-1}$ between N$_2$H$^+$ (3-2) and CO isotopologues. The large widths
of the N$_2$H$^+$ (3-2) line in the clumps indicate an increase of the velocity
dispersion in their dense interiors, which may be related to the star formation
process. The N$_2$H$^+$ abundance drops toward the luminous IR source.

information about the configuration of an IoT device is the device's firmware.
However, firmware analysis is complex and automated firmware analyses have thus
far been confined to devices with more traditional operating systems such as
Linux or VxWorks. Most IoT peripherals, due to lacking traditional operating
systems and implementing a wide variety of communication technologies, have
only been the subject of smaller-scale analyses. Peripheral firmware analysis
is further complicated by the fact that such firmware files are predominantly

Conventional methods directly fuse bounding boxes but typically fail to

problem of confidence discrepancy for the detector ensembles. The confidence
has little effect on single detectors but significantly affects detector
ensembles. To address this issue, we propose a novel ensemble called the
Probabilistic Ranking Aware Ensemble (PRAE) that refines the confidence of
bounding boxes from detectors. By simultaneously considering the category and
the location on the same validation set, we obtain a more reliable confidence
based on statistical probability. We can then rank the detected bounding boxes
for assembly. We also introduce a bandit approach to address the confidence
imbalance problem caused by the need to deal with different numbers of boxes at
different confidence levels. We use our PRAE-based non-maximum suppression

Gaussian part of this state as an independent state by itself, which yields a
simple, but with respect to the correlation structure interesting example of a
two-mode Gaussian analogue of an isotropic state. Unlike conventional isotropic
states which are defined as a convex combination of a thermal and an entangled
density operator, the Gaussian version studied here is defined by a convex
combination of the corresponding covariance matrices and can be understood as
entangled pure state with additional Gaussian noise controlled by a mixing
probability. Using various entanglement criteria and measures, we study the
non-classical correlations contained in this state. Unlike the previously
studied non-Gaussian two-parametric isotropic state, the Gaussian state
considered here features a finite threshold in the parameter space where
entanglement sets in. In particular, it turns out that it exhibits an analogous
phenomenology as the finite-dimensional two-qubit isotropic state.

experiments are conducted to validate our methods on an in-the-wild dataset

solution has been studied experimentally and theoretically. A global fit

supported by \emph{ab initio} calculations of NADH structure in solutions. A
theoretical model was developed for description of the polarized fluorescence
decay in enzyme-NADH binary complexes that considered several possible
interaction scenarios. We suggest that the origin of a significant enhancement
of the nanosecond decay time value in the ADH-bounded NADH compare with the
free NADH can be attributed to the significant decrease of non-radiative
relaxation probabilities due to decrease of charges separations in the
nicotinamide ring in the conditions of an apolar ADH-NADH binding site
environment. The existence of a single decay time in the ADH-NADH complex in
the nanosecond time-domain in comparison with two decay times observed in free
NADH can be attributed to a single NADH unfolded \emph{trans}-like conformation
bounded within the ADH site. Comparison of the experimental data obtained and
the theory developed suggested the existence of an anisotropic relaxation time
of about 1 ns related most likely with interactions between excited NADH and
the ADH binding site that resulted in the rearrangement of nuclear distribution
and rotation of fluorescence transition dipole moment.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) semantic segmentation. Existing feature
alignment methods for semantic segmentation learn domain-invariant features by
adversarial training to reduce domain discrepancy, but they have two limits: 1)
associations among pixels are not maintained, 2) the classifier trained on the
source domain couldn't adapted well to the target. In this paper, we propose a
new UDA semantic segmentation approach based on domain closeness assumption to
alleviate the above problems. Specifically, a prototype clustering strategy is
applied to cluster pixels with the same semantic, which will better maintain
associations among target domain pixels during the feature alignment. After
clustering, to make the classifier more adaptive, a normalized cut loss based
on the affinity graph of the target domain is utilized, which will make the
decision boundary target-specific. Sufficient experiments conducted on GTA5

effectiveness of our method, which illustrated that our results achieved the

Jarnicki, Pflug and Vigu\'{e} in 1992. We also establish a corresponding result
for some pseudoconvex domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ for $n \ge 2$.
  This result will follow from an explicit characterization (up to
biholomorphisms) of proper holomorphic maps from a non-degenerate
finitely-connected planar domain, $\Omega$, onto the standard unit disk
$\mathbb{D}$ which answers a question posed by Schmieder in 2005. Similar to
Bell and Kaleem's characterization of proper holomorphic maps in terms of
Grunsky maps (2008), our characterization of proper holomorphic maps from
$\Omega$ onto $\mathbb{D}$ is an analogous result to Fatou's famous result that
proper holomorphic maps of the unit disk onto itself are finite Blashcke
products.
  Our approach uses a harmonic measure condition of Wang and Yin (2017) on the
existence of a proper holomorphic map with prescribed zeros. We will see that
certain functions $\eta(\cdot,p)$ play an analogous role to the M\""{o}bius
transformations that fix $\mathbb{D}$ in finite Blaschke products. These
functions $\eta(\cdot,p)$ map $\Omega$ conformally onto the unit disk with
circular arcs (centered at 0) removed and map $p$ to $0$ and can be given in
terms of the Schottky-Klein prime function. We also extend a result of Grunsky
(1941) and hence introduce a parameter space for proper holomorphic maps from
$\Omega$ onto $\mathbb{D}$.

predicts direct connections between concepts; and a target prediction model

relies exclusively on static knowledge sources, we leverage language models
finetuned on knowledge stored in ConceptNet, to dynamically generate knowledge
paths, as explanations of implicit knowledge that connects sentences in texts.
As a central contribution we design manual and automatic evaluation settings

using only readily available short-range properties like bond lengths, bond
angles and connectivity of the constituents. This method is a variant of
Monte-Carlo (MC) method wherein the basic constituents of an amorphous network
i.e. rigid polyhedral units are connected randomly obeying certain steric
constraints. The algorithm is designed to reproduce the medium-range order
universally observed in glasses. The method somewhat resembles the reverse MC
(RMC) method where a random move of an atom inside a box is accepted or
rejected depending upon whether it decreases or increases the deviation from
the experimentally observed features. However unlike RMC, this method does not
demand large experimental sets of scattering data which in most cases is a
priori not available for glasses. It rather relies on the stochasticity of MC
method to produce glassy structures. The algorithm is first validated against
SiO2 glass structure by comparing with the available structures from other
methods and experimental data. The method is then extended for developing more
complex Iron Phosphate Glass (IPG) structures and a comparison with existing
models of IPG developed using quench-from-melt scheme implemented in classical
Molecular Dynamics (MD) reveals that the method is extensible to complex
glasses also. This study addresses the often-neglected issue of
non-availability of correct starting structures in simulating glasses using MD
or Density Functional Theory (DFT).

if an agent has its own personal choice, it is always overridden by observation
of previous agents' actions. This could mean agents end up in a situation where
they may act without valuing their own information. As information cascades can

tweets to a baseline tweet dataset from randomly sampled Twitter users using
computational and qualitative analysis to compare their emoji usage. We utilise
Word2Vec language models to examine the semantic relationships between emojis,
identifying clear distinctions in the emoji-emoji relationships of Anonymous

emojis occur, finding that although similarities exist between the emoji usage
of our Anonymous and baseline Twitter datasets, Anonymous users appear to have
adopted more specific interpretations of certain emojis. This includes the use
of emojis as a means of expressing adoration and infatuation towards notable
Anonymous affiliates. These findings indicate that emojis appear to retain a
considerable degree of similarity within Anonymous accounts as compared to more

Concretely, we propose to upload the prediction results and node embeddings to

which are distributed to each client to enrich the training labels and
complement the graph structure respectively, thereby improving the quality of
each local model. Moreover, the global self-supervision enables the information
of each client to flow and share in a privacy-preserving manner, thus
alleviating the heterogeneity and utilizing the complementarity of graph data
among different clients. Finally, experimental results show that FedGL
significantly outperforms baselines on four widely used graph datasets.

viscosity to conserve the rotational angular momentum. Specifically, the
emergence of multiple parallel vortices and their rigid-body rotations were
observed in our previous SPH simulations. The reported scheme is based on a
classical approximation that assumes the fluid forces of both components and
their interactions, with the expectation of functioning as a coarse-grained
model of existing approximations that couple a microscopic model and the
Navier-Stokes equation. Based on previous studies, this paper proposes an
improved SPH scheme that explicitly incorporates vortex dynamics into SPH to
reproduce vortex lattices, which was not possible in previous studies.
Consequently, our improved scheme was observed to reproduce vortex lattices by
introducing the Magnus force and interaction forces among vortices into the
reformulated two-fluid model. The spinnings of the vortices and rigid-body
rotations were also observed. The number of vortices showed a certain agreement
with Feynman's rule after the model parameter was optimized. Notably, from a
scientific point of view, such vortex lattices are reproduced by the
classical-mechanical approximation. We hope that our model will help physicists
studying low-temperature physics find a new way of approaching this bizarre

Selection (NEDS) based on grid search or empirical knowledge suffer from heavy

perspective of minimum entropy principle. Subsequently, we propose a novel
Minimum Graph Entropy (MinGE) algorithm for NEDS with graph data. To be
specific, MinGE considers both feature entropy and structure entropy on graphs,
which are carefully designed according to the characteristics of the rich
information in them. The feature entropy, which assumes the embeddings of
adjacent nodes to be more similar, connects node features and link topology on
graphs. The structure entropy takes the normalized degree as basic unit to
further measure the higher-order structure of graphs. Based on them, we design
MinGE to directly calculate the ideal node embedding dimension for any graph.
Finally, comprehensive experiments with popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our

problem is NP-hard motivates us to study effective algorithms with provable
performance guarantees. To do so, we first reformulate SSVD as a mixed-integer
semidefinite program, which can be solved exactly for small- or medium-sized
instances by a customized branch and cut algorithm with closed-form cuts, and
is extremely useful to evaluate the quality of approximation algorithms. We
next develop three selection algorithms based on different selection criteria
and two searching algorithms -- greedy and local search. We prove the
approximation ratios for all the approximation algorithms and show that all the
ratios are tight, i.e., we demonstrate that these approximation ratios are
unimprovable. Finally, our numerical study demonstrates the high solution
quality and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

colloidal complex coacervates providing a Pickering effect. The complexed state
of PESCs could make them unsuitable o/w Pickering emulsifiers, which instead
require a balance between colloidal structure and stability, amphiphilicity and
wettability. Here we hypothesize that PESCs coacervates are efficient Pickering
stabilizers. Instead of classical surfactants, we employ sophorolipid (SL)
biosurfactants, atypical anionic/neutral stimuli-responsive biosurfactants.
Despite their tunable charge and mild amphiphilic character, they can be used
in combination with cationic/neutral polyelectrolytes (chitosan, CHL, or
poly-L-lysine, PLL) to form PESC coacervates for the development of biobased,
but also pH-switchable, Pickering emulsions.Aqueous solutions of SL-CHL (or
SL-PLL) complex coacervates are emulsified with dodecane. Confocal laser
scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy under cryogenic
conditions (cryo-SEM) demonstrate the Pickering effect, while optical
microscopy and oscillatory rheology respectively assess the emulsion formation
and relative viscoelastic properties.Both SL-CHL and SL-PLL PESCs stabilize o/w
emulsions up to $\Phi$oil of 0.7 only in the pH region of complex coacervation
(6 < pH < 9): outside this range, phase separation occurs. Rheology shows a
typical solid-like response and mechanical recovery upon applying large
deformations. CLSM and cryo-SEM highlight a colloidal structure, associated to
the complex coacervates, of the oil/water interface and suggest a Pickering
effect. These findings demonstrate the Pickering effect from PESC coacervates
and the possibility to use biobased and biocompatible components, with
application potential in cosmetics, food science, or oil recovery.

pattern speed, and they eventually slow down over time due to the dynamical
friction with the surrounding dark matter halo. However, the nature of the
decay in pattern speed values and whether all peanut bars rotate with a single
pattern speed remain to be investigated. Using N-body simulation of a
collisionless stellar disc, we study the case of a long bar with a
three-dimensional peanut structure prominent in both edge-on and face-on
projections. We show that such a bar possesses three distinct peaks in the m=2
Fourier component. Using the Tremaine-Weinberg method, we measure the pattern
speeds and demonstrate that the three regions associated with the three peaks
rotate with different pattern speeds. The inner region, which is the core of
the peanut, rotates slower than the outer regions. In addition, the pattern
speed of the inner bar also decays faster than the outer bar with a decay
timescale of 4.5 Gyr for the inner part and ~12.5 Gyr for the outer parts. This
is manifested as a systematic offset in density and velocity dispersion maps
between the inner and outer regions of the long peanut bar. We discuss the
importance of our findings in the context of bar dynamics.

instances at different scales. Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is the classic
architecture to build a feature pyramid with high-level semantics throughout.
However, intrinsic defects in feature extraction and fusion inhibit FPN from
further aggregating more discriminative features. In this work, we propose
Attention Aggregation based Feature Pyramid Network (A^2-FPN), to improve
multi-scale feature learning through attention-guided feature aggregation. In
feature extraction, it extracts discriminative features by
collecting-distributing multi-level global context features, and mitigates the
semantic information loss due to drastically reduced channels. In feature
fusion, it aggregates complementary information from adjacent features to
generate location-wise reassembly kernels for content-aware sampling, and
employs channel-wise reweighting to enhance the semantic consistency before
element-wise addition. A^2-FPN shows consistent gains on different instance
segmentation frameworks. By replacing FPN with A^2-FPN in Mask R-CNN, our model
boosts the performance by 2.1% and 1.6% mask AP when using ResNet-50 and
ResNet-101 as backbone, respectively. Moreover, A^2-FPN achieves an improvement
of 2.0% and 1.4% mask AP when integrated into the strong baselines such as

over-parameterized neural networks for deployment on low-resource systems.
Recent state-of-the-art techniques for retraining pruned networks such as
weight rewinding and learning rate rewinding have been shown to outperform the
traditional fine-tuning technique in recovering the lost accuracy (Renda et
al., 2020), but so far it is unclear what accounts for such performance. In
this work, we conduct extensive experiments to verify and analyze the uncanny
effectiveness of learning rate rewinding. We find that the reason behind the
success of learning rate rewinding is the usage of a large learning rate.
Similar phenomenon can be observed in other learning rate schedules that
involve large learning rates, e.g., the 1-cycle learning rate schedule (Smith
et al., 2019). By leveraging the right learning rate schedule in retraining, we
demonstrate a counter-intuitive phenomenon in that randomly pruned networks
could even achieve better performance than methodically pruned networks
(fine-tuned with the conventional approach). Our results emphasize the
cruciality of the learning rate schedule in pruned network retraining - a

observational evidence for the formation of coronal loops through magnetic
reconnection as new magnetic fluxes emerge into the solar atmosphere.
Extreme-ultraviolet observations of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) clearly show the newly formed
loops following magnetic reconnection within a plasma sheet. Formation of the
loops is also seen in the h{\alpha} line-core images taken by the New Vacuum
Solar Telescope. Observations from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard
SDO show that a positive-polarity flux concentration moves towards a
negative-polarity one with a speed of ~0.4 km/s, before the formation of
coronal loops. During the loop formation process, we found signatures of flux
cancellation and subsequent enhancement of the transverse field between the two
polarities. The three-dimensional magnetic field structure reconstructed
through a magnetohydrostatic model shows field lines consistent with the loops
in AIA images. Numerous bright blobs with an average width of 1.37 Mm appear
intermittently in the plasma sheet and move upward with a projected velocity of
~114 km/s. The temperature, emission measure and density of these blobs are
about 3 MK, 2.0x10^(28) cm^(-5) and 1.2x10^(10) cm^(-3), respectively. A power
spectral analysis of these blobs indicates that the observed reconnection is
likely not dominated by a turbulent process. We have also identified flows with
a velocity of 20 to 50 km/s towards the footpoints of the newly formed coronal
loops.

the nonunitary evolution. These states determine the resulting final state of
the chain and long-term shape of the polaron. In addition to formation of the

of non-decaying states from an initial superposition or mixture.

workflow extracts the most important information from large input data and
stores it in smaller derived data objects. The derived data objects can then be
used for further analysis tasks.
  Typically, those workflows use distributed storage and computing resources. A
straightforward configuration of storage media would be low cost tape storage
and higher cost disk storage. The large, infrequently accessed input data is
stored on tape storage. The smaller, frequently accessed derived data is stored
on disk storage. In a best case scenario, the large input data is only accessed
very infrequently and in a well planned pattern. However, practice shows that
often the data has to be processed continuously and unpredictably. This can
significantly reduce tape storage performance. A common approach to counter
this is storing copies of the large input data on disk storage.
  This contribution evaluates an approach that uses cloud storage resources to
serve as a flexible cache or buffer depending on the computational workflow.
The proposed model is elaborated for the case of continuously processed data.
For the evaluation, a simulation was developed, which can be used to evaluate
models related to storage and network resources.
  We show that using commercial cloud storage can reduce the on-premises disk
storage requirements, while maintaining an equal throughput of jobs. Moreover,
the key metrics of the model are discussed and an approach is described that
uses the simulation to assist with the decision process of using commercial
cloud storage. The goal is to investigate approaches and propose new evaluation

wavelength radio continuum counterparts to this sample of YSO candidates which
we use to constrain the current SFR in the CMZ. As part of the GLOSTAR survey,
D-configuration VLA data was obtained for the Galactic Centre, covering
-2$^{\circ}<l<$2$^{\circ}$ and -1$^{\circ}<b<$1$^{\circ}$, with a frequency
coverage of 4-8 GHz. We matched YSOs with radio continuum sources based on
selection criteria and classified these radio sources as potential HII regions
and determined their physical properties. Of the 334 YSO candidates, we found
35 with radio continuum counterparts. We find that 94 YSOs are associated with
dense dust condensations identified in the 870 $\mu$m ATLASGAL survey, of which
14 have a GLOSTAR counterpart. Of the 35 YSOs with radio counterparts, 11 are
confirmed as HII regions, based on their spectral indices and the literature.
We estimated their Lyman continuum photon flux in order to estimate the mass of
the ionising star. Combining these with known sources, the present-day SFR in
the CMZ is calculated to be $\sim$0.068 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is
$\sim$6.8$\%$ of the Galactic SFR. Candidate YSOs that lack radio counterparts
may not have yet evolved to the stage of exhibiting an HII region or,
conversely, are older and have dispersed their natal clouds. Since many lack
dust emission, the latter is more likely. Our SFR estimate in the CMZ is in
agreement with previous estimates in the literature.

the sense that any collection of $k$ particles in the $n$-particle system are
asymptotically independent, as $n\to\infty$ with $k$ fixed or perhaps $k=o(n)$.
This paper quantifies this notion for a class of continuous Gibbs measures on
Euclidean space with pairwise interactions, with main examples being systems
governed by convex interactions and uniformly convex confinement potentials.
The distance between the marginal law of $k$ particles and its limiting product
measure is shown to be $O((k/n)^{c \wedge 2})$, with $c$ proportional to the
squared temperature. In the high temperature case, this improves upon prior
results based on subadditivity of entropy, which yield $O(k/n)$ at best. The
bound $O((k/n)^2)$ cannot be improved, as a Gaussian example demonstrates. The
results are non-asymptotic, and distance is quantified via relative Fisher
information, relative entropy, or the squared quadratic Wasserstein metric. The
method relies on an a priori functional inequality for the limiting measure,
used to derive an estimate for the $k$-particle distance in terms of the
$(k+1)$-particle distance.

the aim to improve the computational efficiency. It is observed that the most
informative region in each frame of a video is usually a small image patch,
which shifts smoothly across frames. Therefore, we model the patch localization
problem as a sequential decision task, and propose a reinforcement learning
based approach for efficient spatially adaptive video recognition (AdaFocus).
In specific, a light-weighted ConvNet is first adopted to quickly process the
full video sequence, whose features are used by a recurrent policy network to
localize the most task-relevant regions. Then the selected patches are inferred
by a high-capacity network for the final prediction. During offline inference,
once the informative patch sequence has been generated, the bulk of computation
can be done in parallel, and is efficient on modern GPU devices. In addition,
we demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily extended by further
considering the temporal redundancy, e.g., dynamically skipping less valuable
frames. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, i.e., ActivityNet,

Considering these limitations, we reform this problem setting for real-world

varied kinematic structures within a semantic category, and multiple instances
to co-exist in an observation of real world. To support this task, we build an
articulated model repository ReArt-48 and present an efficient dataset
generation pipeline, which contains Fast Articulated Object Modeling (FAOM) and
Semi-Authentic MixEd Reality Technique (SAMERT). Accompanying the pipeline, we
build a large-scale mixed reality dataset ReArtMix and a real world dataset
ReArtVal. We also propose an effective framework ReArtNOCS that exploits RGB-D
input to estimate part-level pose for multiple instances in a single forward
pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ReArtNOCS can achieve
good performance on both CAPER and CAPE settings. We believe it could serve as
a strong baseline for future research on the CAPER task.

parametrisation of our underlying hierarchical dynamic spatio-temporal model is
motivated by a forward-time, centred-space finite difference solution to a
collection of stochastic partial differential equations, where the main driving
forces are advection and diffusion. Observations from both weather radar and
ground based rain gauges provide information from which we can learn about the
likely values of the (latent) precipitation field in addition to other unknown
model parameters. Working in the Bayesian paradigm provides a coherent
framework for capturing uncertainty both in the underlying model parameters and
also in our forecasts. Further, appealing to simulation based (MCMC) sampling
yields a straightforward solution to handling zeros, treated as censored
observations, via data augmentation. Both the underlying state and the
observations are of moderately large dimension ($\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ respectively) and this renders standard inference
approaches computationally infeasible. Our solution is to embed the ensemble
Kalman smoother within a Gibbs sampling scheme to facilitate approximate
Bayesian inference in reasonable time. Both the methodology and the
effectiveness of our posterior sampling scheme are demonstrated via simulation

era in exploring both cosmos and new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In
the standard picture, although mostly $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_e$ are produced in the
source, oscillation will produce $\nu_\tau$ {\it en route}. Certain beyond SM
scenarios, like interaction with ultralight DM can alter this picture. Thus,
the flavor composition of the cosmic neutrino flux can open up the possibility
of exploring certain beyond the SM scenarios that are inaccessible otherwise.
We show that the $\tau$ flavor holds a special place among the neutrino flavors
in elucidating new physics. Interpreting the two anomalous events observed by
ANITA as $\nu_\tau$ events makes the tau flavor even more intriguing. We study
how the detection of the two tau events by ICECUBE constrains the interaction
of the neutrinos with ultralight dark matter and discuss the implications of
this interaction for even higher energy cosmic neutrinos detectable by future
radio telescopes such as ARA, ARIANNA and GRAND. We also revisit the $3+1$
neutrino scheme as a solution to the two anomalous ANITA events and clarify a
misconception that exists in the literature about the evolution of high energy
neutrinos in matter within the $3+1$ scheme with a possibility of scattering
off nuclei. We show that the existing bounds on the flux of $\nu_\tau$ with
energy of EeV rules out this solution for the ANITA events. We show that the
$3+1$ solution can be saved from both this bound and from the bound on the
extra relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe by turning on the
interaction of neutrinos with ultralight dark matter.

control seeking allocation of authorised users to every step of the workflow,
subject to workflow specification constraints. It was noticed that the number
$k$ of steps is typically small compared to the number of users in the
real-world instances of WSP; therefore $k$ is considered as the parameter in
WSP parametrised complexity research. While WSP in general was shown to be
W[1]-hard, WSP restricted to a special case of user-independent (UI)
constraints is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). However, restriction to the UI
constraints might be impractical.
  To efficiently handle non-UI constraints, we introduce the notion of
branching factor of a constraint. As long as the branching factors of the
constraints are relatively small and the number of non-UI constraints is
reasonable, WSP can be solved in FPT time.
  Extending the results from Karapetyan et al. (2019), we demonstrate that
general-purpose solvers are capable of achieving FPT-like performance on WSP
with arbitrary constraints when used with appropriate formulations. This
enables one to tackle most of practical WSP instances. While important on its
own, we hope that this result will also motivate researchers to look for
FPT-aware formulations of other FPT problems.

the last one by embedding CI into the multinomial probit (MNP) choice

estimated using a constrained maximum likelihood approach, and its statistical
properties are validated through a comprehensive Monte Carlo study. The
CI-based choice model is empirically advantageous as it captures interaction
effects while maintaining monotonicity. It also provides information on the
complementarity between pairs of attributes coupled with their importance
ranking as a by-product of the estimation. These insights could potentially
assist policymakers in making policies to improve the preference level for an

zonal jets in the winter northern hemisphere shift equatorward and weaken
relative to a free-running control simulation from the same MGCM. The Ensemble
Mars Atmosphere Reanalysis System (EMARS) reanalysis, which is also based on
TES temperature retrievals, also shows jet weakening (but less if any shifting)
relative to a control simulation performed with the underlying Geophysical

boundary. As a prominent example, helical topological edge states (TESs) of
two-dimensional topological insulators (2DTIs) and their stacked
three-dimensional (3D) equivalent, weak topological insulators (WTIs), have
sparked research enthusiasm due to their potential application in the next
generation of electronics/spintronics with low dissipation. Here, we propose
layered superconducting material CaSn as a WTI with nontrivial Z2 as well as
nodal line semimetal protected by crystalline non-symmorphic symmetry. Our
systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) investigation on
the electronic structure exhibits excellent agreement with the calculation.
Furthermore, scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) at the
surface step edge shows signatures of the expected TES. These integrated
evidences from ARPES, STM/STS measurement and corresponding ab initio
calculation strongly support the existence of TES in the non-symmorphic nodal
line semimetal CaSn, which may become a versatile material platform to realize
multiple exotic electronic states as well as topological superconductivity.

requires the transmission of local datasets from the clients to a parameter
server (PS) entailing huge communication overhead. To overcome this, federated
learning (FL) has been suggested as a promising tool, wherein the clients send
only the model updates to the PS instead of the whole dataset. However, FL
demands powerful computational resources from the clients. In practice, not all
the clients have sufficient computational resources to participate in training.
To address this common scenario, we propose a more efficient approach called
hybrid federated and centralized learning (HFCL), wherein only the clients with
sufficient resources employ FL, while the remaining ones send their datasets to
the PS, which computes the model on behalf of them. Then, the model parameters
are aggregated at the PS. To improve the efficiency of dataset transmission, we
propose two different techniques: i) increased computation-per-client and ii)
sequential data transmission. Notably, the HFCL frameworks outperform FL with
up to 20\% improvement in the learning accuracy when only half of the clients
perform FL while having 50\% less communication overhead than CL since all the
clients collaborate on the learning process with their datasets.

To achieve such a comprehensive sensor fusion system, one has to tackle several
challenges such as data synchronization, multi-threading programming, bundle

useful suggestions for both fashion companies and fashion lovers. Although
various studies have been devoted to tackling this challenging task, they only
studied limited fashion elements with highly seasonal or simple patterns, which
could hardly reveal the real complex fashion trends. Moreover, the mainstream
solutions for this task are still statistical-based and solely focus on
time-series data modeling, which limit the forecast accuracy. Towards
insightful fashion trend forecasting, previous work [1] proposed to analyze
more fine-grained fashion elements which can informatively reveal fashion
trends. Specifically, it focused on detailed fashion element trend forecasting
for specific user groups based on social media data. In addition, it proposed a
neural network-based method, namely KERN, to address the problem of fashion

among fashion elements but also those among user groups, thus capturing more
types of correlations among various fashion trends. To further improve the
performance of long-range trend forecasting, the REAR method devises a sliding
temporal attention mechanism, which is able to capture temporal patterns on
future horizons better. Extensive experiments and more analysis have been
conducted on the FIT and GeoStyle datasets to evaluate the performance of REAR.
Experimental and analytical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the

investigated. In order to carry out this study, reheating is described in
detail by means of a formalism which tracks the evolution of scalar fields and
perfect fluids in interaction (the inflatons and their decay products). This
framework is then used to establish the general equations of motion of the
background and perturbative quantities controlling the evolution of the system
during reheating. Next, these equations are solved exactly by means of a new
numerical code. Moreover, new analytical techniques, allowing us to interpret
and approximate these solutions, are developed. As an illustration of a
physical prediction that could be affected by the micro-physics of reheating,
the amplitude of non-adiabatic perturbations in double inflation is considered.
It is found that ignoring the fine-structure of reheating, as usually done in
the standard approach, can lead to differences as big as $\sim 50\%$, while our
semi-analytic estimates can reduce this error to $\sim 10\%$. We conclude that,
in multi-field inflation, tracking the perturbations through the details of the

correlations from fuzzy frequency tables. Fuzzy counts are of particular
interest to many disciplines including social and behavioral sciences, and are
especially relevant when observed data are classified using fuzzy categories -
as for socio-economic studies, clinical evaluations, content analysis,
inter-rater reliability analysis - or when imprecise observations are
classified into either precise or imprecise categories - as for the analysis of
ratings data or fuzzy coded variables. In these cases, the space of count
matrices is no longer defined over naturals and, consequently, the polychoric
estimator cannot be used to accurately estimate latent linear correlations. The
aim of this contribution is twofold. First, we illustrate a computational
procedure based on generalized natural numbers for computing fuzzy frequencies.
Second, we reformulate the problem of estimating latent linear correlations
from fuzzy counts in the context of Expectation-Maximization based maximum
likelihood estimation. A simulation study and two applications are used to
investigate the characteristics of the proposed method. Overall, the results
show that the fuzzy EM-based polychoric estimator is more efficient to deal
with imprecise count data as opposed to standard polychoric estimators that may
be used in this context.

of the environment dynamics and the recent behavior of the agent. Then combined
with the soft policy iteration paradigm, the LC-SAC method alternates between
soft policy evaluation and soft policy improvement until it converges to the

significantly better than the SAC algorithm on the MetaWorld ML1 tasks whose
dynamics changes drasticly among different episodes, and is comparable to SAC
on the continuous control benchmark task MuJoCo whose dynamics changes slowly
or doesn't change between different episodes. In addition, we also conduct
relevant experiments to determine the impact of different hyperparameter
settings on the performance of the LC-SAC algorithm and give the reasonable
suggestions of hyperparameter setting.

precision medicine. Model and algorithm-based methods have been developed
within the causal inference framework to achieve valid estimation and
inference. Existing methods such as the A-learner, R-learner, modified
covariates method (with and without efficiency augmentation), inverse
propensity score weighting, and augmented inverse propensity score weighting
have been proposed mostly under the square error loss function. The performance
of these methods in the presence of data irregularity and high dimensionality,
such as that encountered in electronic health record (EHR) data analysis, has
been less studied. In this research, we describe a general formulation that
unifies many of the existing learners through a common score function. The new
formulation allows the incorporation of least absolute deviation (LAD)
regression and dimension reduction techniques to counter the challenges in EHR
data analysis. We show that under a set of mild regularity conditions, the
resultant estimator has an asymptotic normal distribution. Within this
framework, we proposed two specific estimators for EHR analysis based on
weighted LAD with penalties for sparsity and smoothness simultaneously. Our
simulation studies show that the proposed methods are more robust to outliers
under various circumstances. We use these methods to assess the blood
pressure-lowering effects of two commonly used antihypertensive therapies.

reproduction number (the exact details are of no relevance as far as the
conclusions of this work are concerned), time series of new cases were
generated in a time domain of nearly one year for the five top-ranking
countries in the cumulative number of infections by January 1, 2021. These
countries are (in descending order of infections): the United States of
America, India, Brazil, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The processing of each
simulated time series led to the establishment of relations between the input

each country and algorithm, separately; this work argues that all five
algorithms underestimate the effective reproduction number when the latter
exceeds the critical value of $1$. The five algorithms were subsequently
applied to the real-life time series of new cases for the aforementioned five
countries, which also span a temporal interval of nearly one year; corrected
values of the effective reproduction number are obtained for these countries in

principle of most CFD codes seems not to be sufficiently considered in the
previous network models. In this study, a FVM network (FVMN) which simulate the
principles of FVM by the tier-input and derivative-output system was proposed.
The performance of this baseline model was evaluated using unsteady reacting
flow datasets. It was confirmed that the maximum relative error of the FVMN
(0.04%) was much smaller than the general model (1.12%) in the training
dataset. This difference in error size was more prominent in the prediction
datasets. In addition, it was observed that the calculation speed was about 10
times faster in FVMN than CFD solver even under the same CPU condition.
Although the relative error with the ground truth data was significantly

responses (AIRs) which allows for fast convergence by exploiting prior
knowledge about the fundamental structure of AIRs. The proposed method assumes
that the variability of AIRs of an acoustic scene is confined to a
low-dimensional manifold which is embedded in a high-dimensional space of
possible AIR estimates. We discuss various approaches to locally approximate
the AIR manifold by affine subspaces which are assumed to be tangential
hyperplanes to the manifold. The validity of these model assumptions is
verified for simulated data. Subsequently, we describe how the learned models
can be used to improve online AIR estimates by projecting them onto an
adaptively estimated subspace. The parameters determining the subspace are
learned from training samples in a local neighbourhood to the current AIR
estimate. This allows the system identification algorithm to benefit from
preceding estimates in the acoustic scene. To assess the proximity of training
data AIRs to the current AIR estimate, we introduce a probabilistic extension
of the Euclidean distance which improves the performance for applications with
correlated excitation signals. Furthermore, we describe how model imperfections
can be tackled by a soft projection of the AIR estimates. The proposed
algorithm exhibits significantly faster convergence properties in comparison to
a high-performance state-of-the-art algorithm. Furthermore, we show an improved
steady-state performance for speech-excited system identification scenarios

On one hand, new codecs and compression standards come with advanced in-loop
filters and on the other hand, displays are equipped with high capacity
processing units for post-treatment of decoded videos. This paper proposes a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based post-processing algorithm for intra
and inter frames of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) coded streams. Depending on
the frame type, this method benefits from normative prediction signal by
feeding it as an additional input along with reconstructed signal and a
Quantization Parameter (QP)-map to the CNN. Moreover, an optional Model
Selection (MS) strategy is adopted to pick the best trained model among
available ones at the encoder side and signal it to the decoder side. This MS
strategy is applicable at both frame level and block level. The experiments
under the Random Access (RA) configuration of the VVC Test Model (VTM-10.0)
show that the proposed prediction-aware algorithm can bring an additional BD-BR
gain of -1.3% compared to the method without the prediction information.
Furthermore, the proposed MS scheme brings -0.5% more BD-BR gain on top of the
prediction-aware method.

be represented by a single nonlinear modal oscillator. The properties of the
modal oscillator can be determined by computational or experimental nonlinear
modal analysis. The simplification to a single-nonlinear-mode model facilitates
qualitative and global analysis, and substantially reduces the computational
effort required for probabilistic methods and design optimization. Important
limitations of this theory are that only purely mechanical systems can be
analyzed and that the respective nonlinear mode has to be recomputed when the
system's structural properties are varied. With the theoretical extension
proposed in this work, it becomes feasible to attach linear subsystems to the
primary mechanical system, and to approximate the dynamics of this coupled
system using only the nonlinear mode of the primary mechanical system. The
attachments must be described by linear ordinary or differential-algebraic
equations with time-invariant coefficient matrices. The attachments do not need
to be of purely mechanical nature, but may contain, for instance, electric,
magnetic, acoustic, thermal or aerodynamic models. This considerably extends
the range of utility of nonlinear modes to applications as diverse as model
updating or vibration energy harvesting. As long as the attachments do not
significantly deteriorate the host system's modal deflection shape, it is shown
that their effect can be reduced to a complex-valued modal impedance and an
imposed modal forcing term. In the present work, the proposed approach is
computationally assessed for the analysis of exciter-structure interaction.
More specifically, the force drop typically encountered in frequency response
testing is revisited.

costs. Data-driven approaches are able to speed the process up significantly by
enabling to incorporate the effective micromechanical response in macroscale
simulations without the need of performing additional computations at each
Gauss point explicitly. Traditionally artificial neural networks (ANNs) have
been the surrogate modeling technique of choice in the solid mechanics
community. However they suffer from severe drawbacks due to their parametric
nature and suboptimal training and inference properties for the investigated
datasets in a three dimensional setting. These problems can be avoided using
local approximate Gaussian process regression (laGPR). This method can allow
the prediction of stress outputs at particular strain space locations by
training local regression models based on Gaussian processes, using only a
subset of the data for each local model, offering better and more reliable
accuracy than ANNs. A modified Newton-Raphson approach is proposed to
accommodate for the local nature of the laGPR approximation when solving the
global structural problem in a FE setting. Hence, the presented work offers a
complete and general framework enabling multiscale calculations combining a

a month-long, high frequency record of acoustic ebullition data from an

when atmospheric pressure drops below a threshold that is approximately equal
to the long-term average pressure. The intensity of ebullition is proportional
to the amount by which the pressure drops below this threshold. In addition,
field measurements of turbidity, in conjunction with laboratory experiments,
provide evidence that ebullition is responsible for previously unexplained

quaternion differentiation to an arbitrary potential, which leads to
generalized Lorentz force. The second quaternion derivative of the potential
leads to expressions similar to generalized Maxwell equations. Finally, we
apply the resulting formalism to electromagnetic and gravitational interactions
