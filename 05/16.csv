on the real line. If $m_n=o(1)$ Yafaev characterized the closure of the form
based on earlier work on quasi-Carleman operators. We give a new proof of the
description of the closure based entirely on moment considerations.
  The main purpose of the present paper is a description of the self-adjoint
Hankel operators associated with closed Hankel forms in the Hilbert space of
square summable sequences.
  We do this not only in the case $m_n=o(1)$ studied by Yafaev but also in two
other cases, where the Hankel form is closable, namely if the moment sequence
is indeterminate or if the moment sequence is determinate with finite index of
determinacy.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In reinforcement learning, experience replay stores past samples for further
reuse. Prioritized sampling is a promising technique to better utilize these
samples. Previous criteria of prioritization include TD error, recentness and
corrective feedback, which are mostly heuristically designed. In this work, we
start from the regret minimization objective, and obtain an optimal
prioritization strategy for Bellman update that can directly maximize the
return of the policy. The theory suggests that data with higher hindsight TD
error, better on-policiness and more accurate Q value should be assigned with
higher weights during sampling. Thus most previous criteria only consider this
strategy partially. We not only provide theoretical justifications for previous
criteria, but also propose two new methods to compute the prioritization
weight, namely ReMERN and ReMERT. ReMERN learns an error network, while ReMERT
exploits the temporal ordering of states. Both methods outperform previous
prioritized sampling algorithms in challenging RL benchmarks, including MuJoCo,
Atari and Meta-World.

geophysical and industrial challenge. Understanding the role of gravity is
particularly important for future planetary exploration in varying
gravitational environments. Using the principle of minimization of energy
dissipation, and combining experiments and variational analysis, we disentangle
the contributions of the gravitational acceleration and confining pressure on
shear strain localization induced by moving fault boundaries at the bottom of a
granular layer. The flow profile is independent of the gravity for geometries
with a free top surface. However, under a confining pressure or if the sheared
layer withstands the weight of the upper layers, increasing gravity promotes
the transition from closed shear zones buried in the bulk to open ones that
intersect the top surface. We show that the center position and width of the
shear zone and the axial angular velocity at the top surface follow universal
scaling laws when properly scaled by the gravity, applied pressure, and layer
thickness. Our finding that the flow profiles lie on a universal master curve
opens the possibility to predict the quasistatic shear flow of granular

for learning over graphs. Despite this success, existing GNNs are constrained
by their local message-passing architecture and are provably limited in their
expressive power. In this work, we propose a new GNN architecture -- the Neural
Tree. The neural tree architecture does not perform message passing on the
input graph, but on a tree-structured graph, called the H-tree, that is
constructed from the input graph. Nodes in the H-tree correspond to subgraphs
in the input graph, and they are reorganized in a hierarchical manner such that
the parent of a node in the H-tree always corresponds to a larger subgraph in
the input graph. We show that the neural tree architecture can approximate any
smooth probability distribution function over an undirected graph. We also
prove that the number of parameters needed to achieve an
$\epsilon$-approximation of the distribution function is exponential in the
treewidth of the input graph, but linear in its size. We prove that any
continuous $\mathcal{G}$-invariant/equivariant function can be approximated by
a nonlinear combination of such probability distribution functions over
$\mathcal{G}$. We apply the neural tree to semi-supervised node classification
in 3D scene graphs, and show that these theoretical properties translate into
significant gains in prediction accuracy, over the more traditional GNN
architectures. We also show the applicability of the neural tree architecture

formation history of the Milky Way, Galactic chemical evolution, and to
constrain exoplanet formation models. Gyrochronology, a relationship between
stellar rotation and age, appears to offer a reliable age indicator for main
sequence (MS) stars over the mass range of approximately 0.6 to 1.3 $M_\odot$.
Those stars lose their angular momentum due to magnetic braking and as a
result, their rotation speeds decrease with age. Although current
gyrochronology relations are fairly well tested for young MS stars with masses
greater than 1 $M_\odot$, primarily in young open clusters, insufficient tests
exist for older and lower mass MS stars. Binary stars offer the potential to
expand and fill in the range of ages and metallicity over which gyrochronology
can be empirically tested. In this paper, we demonstrate a Monte Carlo approach
to evaluate gyrochronology models using binary stars. As examples, we used five
previously published wide binary pairs. We also demonstrate a Monte Carlo
approach to assess the precision and accuracy of ages derived from each
gyrochronology model. For the traditional Skumanich models, the age
uncertainties are $\sigma_{age}$/$age$ = 15-20\% for stars with $B-V$ = 0.65,
and $\sigma_{age}$/$age$ = 5-10\% for stars with $B-V$ = 1.5 and rotation

conditions using numerical simulations of the three-dimensional
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For this, we set initial random weakly nonlinear
excitations and the forcing at high wave numbers, and study propagation of the
turbulent spectrum toward the low wave numbers. Our primary goal is to compare
the results for the evolving spectrum with the previous results obtained for
the kinetic equation of weak wave turbulence. We demonstrate existence of a
regime for which good agreement with the wave turbulence results is found in
terms of the main features of the previously discussed self-similar solution.
In particular, we find a reasonable agreement with the low-frequency and the
high-frequency power-law asymptotics of the evolving solution, including the
anomalous power-law exponent $x^* \approx 1.24$ for the three-dimensional
waveaction spectrum. We also study the regimes of very weak turbulence, when
the evolution is affected by the discreteness of the Fourier space, and the
strong turbulence regime when emerging condensate modifies the wave dynamics
and leads to formation of strongly nonlinear filamentary vortices.

filters, are pseudocomplemented lattices. The pseudocomplement of a\vee b in
the section [b,1] is denoted by a\rightarrow b and can be considered as the
connective implication in a certain kind of intuitionistic logic. Contrary to
the case of Brouwerian semilattices, sections need not be distributive
lattices. This essentially allows possible applications in non-classical
logics. We present a connection of the semilattices mentioned in the beginning
with so-called non-classical implication semilattices which can be converted
into I-algebras having everywhere defined operations. Moreover, we relate our
structures to sectionally and relatively residuated semilattices which means
that our logical structures are closely connected with substructural logics. We
show that I-algebras form a congruence distributive, 3-permutable and weakly

concurrent programs under arbitrary thread interleavings. Delay-bounded
deterministic scheduling, introduced in prior work, is an efficient bug-finding
technique to curb the large cost associated with full scheduling
nondeterminism. In this paper we first present a technique to lift the delay
bound for the case of finite-domain variable programs, thus adding to the
efficiency of bug detection the ability to prove safety of programs under
arbitrary thread interleavings. Second, we demonstrate how, combined with
predicate abstraction, our technique can both refute and verify safety
properties of programs with unbounded variable domains, even for unbounded
thread counts. Previous work has established that, for non-trivial concurrency
routines, predicate abstraction induces a highly complex abstract program
semantics. Our technique, however, never statically constructs an abstract
parametric program; it only requires some abstract-states set to be closed
under certain actions, thus eliminating the dependence on the existence of
verification algorithms for abstract programs. We demonstrate the efficiency of
our technique on many examples used in prior work, and showcase its simplicity
compared to earlier approaches on the unbounded-thread Ticket Lock protocol.

molecular and ionised gas phases are well aligned directionally and that the
maximum rotation velocities closely match. These two gas phases within the disk
are strongly coupled. The metallicity, kinematics and orientation of the atomic

with being part of the extended rotating disk with a well-separated additional

The chiral-odd counterpart of the BC sum rule relates the twist-3 light-cone

elaborate concepts of sparsity in network structure, temporal dynamics, and
interactive learning. In particular, we suggest that temporal dynamics, as
expressed through neural synchrony, nested oscillations, and flexible
sequences, provide a rich computational layer for reading and updating
hierarchical models distributed in long-term memory networks. Moreover,
embracing agent-centered paradigms in AI and CN will accelerate our
understanding of the complex dynamics and behaviors that build useful world
models. A convergence of AI/CN theories and objectives will reveal dynamical
principles of intelligence for brains and engineered learning systems. This

that considering the opposite outcome -- for example, recovery instead of death

relative risk for the studied outcome and the relative risk for the opposite
outcome agree about the direction of effect-measure modification, then so will
the two cumulative hazard ratios, the risk difference, and the odds ratio. When
risks are randomly sampled from the uniform (0,1) distribution, the probability
of this happening is 5/6. Disagreement is probable enough that researchers

An element including the crack is divided into three sub-elements with four

a rotational spring corresponding to the crack. Conversion matrices obtained by
applying continuity conditions at the crack tip are used to transform
displacements of the middle nodes to those of the main nodes. Moreover, another
technique, called spring set, is represented based on a set of springs to model
the crack as a separated element. Components of the stiffness matrix related to

optimization problems with a self-concordant, composite, strongly convex
objective function. Our method is based on performing an approximate Newton
step using a random projection of the Hessian. Our first contribution is to
show that, at each iteration, the embedding dimension (or sketch size) can be
as small as the effective dimension of the Hessian matrix. Leveraging this
novel fundamental result, we design an algorithm with a sketch size
proportional to the effective dimension and which exhibits a quadratic rate of
convergence. This result dramatically improves on the classical
linear-quadratic convergence rates of state-of-the-art sub-sampled Newton
methods. However, in most practical cases, the effective dimension is not known
beforehand, and this raises the question of how to pick a sketch size as small
as the effective dimension while preserving a quadratic convergence rate. Our
second and main contribution is thus to propose an adaptive sketch size
algorithm with quadratic convergence rate and which does not require prior
knowledge or estimation of the effective dimension: at each iteration, it
starts with a small sketch size, and increases it until quadratic progress is
achieved. Importantly, we show that the embedding dimension remains
proportional to the effective dimension throughout the entire path and that our
method achieves state-of-the-art computational complexity for solving convex

gravitational lenses. To evaluate this integral, we use the method of
stationary phase that yields a quartic equation with respect to a Cartesian
projection of the observer's position vector with respect to the vector of the
impact parameter. The resulting quartic equation can be solved analytically
using the method first published by Cardano in 1545. We find that the resulting
solution provides a good approximation of the electromagnetic (EM) field almost
everywhere in the image plane, yielding the well-known astroid caustic of the
quadrupole lens. The sole exception is the immediate vicinity of the caustic
boundary, where a numerical treatment of the diffraction integral yields better
results. We also convolve the quartic solution for the EM field on the image
plane with the point-spread function of a thin lens imaging telescope. By doing
so, we are able to explore the direct relationship between the algebraic
properties of the quartic solution for the EM field, the geometry of the
astroid caustic, and the geometry and shape of the resulting Einstein-cross

solution leads to significant improvements in numerical modeling as evaluation
of this solution is computationally far less expensive than a direct numerical

molten iron cooled to its melting point. However, the nucleation mechanism,

Recent studies found it requires an unrealistic degree of undercooling to
nucleate the stable hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase of iron, which can never
be reached under the actual Earth's core conditions. This contradiction leads
to the inner core nucleation paradox [1]. Here, using a persistent-embryo
method and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the metastable
body-centered cubic (bcc) phase of iron has a much higher nucleation rate than
the hcp phase under inner-core conditions. Thus, the bcc nucleation is likely
to be the first step of inner core formation instead of direct nucleation of
the hcp phase. This mechanism reduces the required undercooling of iron
nucleation, which provides a key factor to solve the inner-core nucleation
paradox. The two-step nucleation scenario of the inner core also opens a new
avenue for understanding the structure and anisotropy of the present inner
core.

accounts for any asymptotic complexity improvement of the general case and we
use it to demonstrate fast-forwarding in several quantum systems. In

quantum gates are exponentials of specific fermionic or bosonic operators,

various techniques (e.g., based on learning, mining, and constraint solving)

limited study on the impact of test selection for each patch (e.g., only the
tests affected by the patch need to be executed as the other tests would keep

selection. Therefore, this paper conducts the first extensive study to

specifically, we implemented widely-used RTS techniques at different levels for

widely used for measuring APR efficiency can incur skewed conclusions, and the
use of inconsistent RTS configurations can further skew the conclusion; (2) all

debate for more than 110 years. Several incompatible proposals exist in the
literature, but a final resolution is still missing. In this work, we
reconsider the problem of relativistic transformation rules for a number of
thermodynamic parameters, including temperature, chemical potential, pressure,
entropy and enthalpy densities for a relativistic perfect fluid using
relativistic kinetic theory. The analysis is carried out in a fully
relativistic covariant manner, and the explicit transformation rules for the
above quantities are obtained in both Minkowski and Rindler spacetimes. Our
results suggest that the temperature of a moving fluid appears to be colder,
supporting the proposal by de Broglie, Einstein and Planck in contrast to other
proposals. Moreover, in the case of Rindler fluid, our work indicates that, the
total number of particles and the total entropy of a perfect fluid in a box
whose bottom is parallel to the Rindler horizon are proportional to the area of
the bottom, but are independent of the height of the box, provided the bottom
of the box is sufficiently close to the Rindler horizon. The area dependence of
the particle number implies that the particles tend to be gathered toward the
bottom of the box and hence implicitly determines the distribution of chemical
potential of the system, whereas the area dependence of the entropy indicates
that the entropy is still additive and may find some applications in explaining
the area law of black hole entropy. As a by product, we also obtain a
relativistically refined version of the famous Saha equation which holds in
both Minkowski and Rindler spacetimes.

second-order descent direction using only the data and model stored in their
own local memory. We let the workers run multiple such iterations locally and
communicate the models to the master node only once every few (say L)
iterations. LocalNewton is highly practical since it requires only one
hyperparameter, the number L of local iterations. We use novel matrix
concentration-based techniques to obtain theoretical guarantees for
LocalNewton, and we validate them with detailed empirical evaluation. To
enhance practicability, we devise an adaptive scheme to choose L, and we show
that this reduces the number of local iterations in worker machines between two
model synchronizations as the training proceeds, successively refining the
model quality at the master. Via extensive experiments using several real-world
datasets with AWS Lambda workers and an AWS EC2 master, we show that
LocalNewton requires fewer than 60% of the communication rounds (between master

state-of-the-art algorithms, to reach the same training~loss.

drops to 240 cm$^2$/Vs at $n=10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$. We also explore the influence
of strain in (111)- and (100)-oriented ScN films. For (111) films, we find that
a 1.0\% compressive epitaxial strain increases the in-plane mobility by 72

image of $F$ the problem of \emph{local inversion} of $F$ is to find all
inverse images $x$ in $\ftwo^n$ such that $y=F(x)$. In Cryptology, such a
problem arises in Cryptanalysis of One way Functions (OWFs). The well known
TMTO attack in Cryptanalysis is a probabilistic algorithm for computing one
solution of local inversion using $O(\sqrt N)$ order computation in offline as
well as online for $N=2^n$. This paper proposes a complete algorithm for
solving the local inversion problem which uses linear complexity for a unique
solution in a periodic orbit. The algorithm is shown to require an offline
computation to solve a hard problem (possibly requiring exponential
computation) and an online computation dependent on $y$ that of repeated
forward evaluation $F(x)$ on points $x$ in $\ff_{2^n}$ which is polynomial time
at each evaluation. However the forward evaluation is repeated at most as many
number of times as the Linear Complexity of the sequence $\{y,F(y),\ldots\}$ to
get one possible solution when this sequence is periodic. All other solutions
are obtained in chains $\{e,F(e),\ldots\}$ for all points $e$ in the Garden of

Tinder. Findings reveal two computer-mediated consent processes: consent

UAPs generalize across many different inputs; this leads to realistic and

HyperNeuron, an efficient and scalable algorithm that allows for the real-time
detection of UAPs by identifying suspicious neuron hyper-activations. Our
results show the effectiveness of HyperNeuron on multiple tasks (image

patch UAPs with comparable or better performance than existing UAP defenses
whilst introducing a significantly reduced latency of only 0.86 milliseconds

assess the role and benefits of transmitting multiple common streams. Unlike
existing works which have considered single-antenna receivers (Multiple-Input

the precoder optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the Weighted

Approximation (SAA) together with the proposed vectorization and Weighted
Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) based approach. Achievable sum-Degree of
Freedom (DoF) of RSMA is derived for the proposed framework as an increasing
function of the number of transmitted common and private streams, which is
further validated by the Ergodic Sum Rate (ESR) performance using Monte Carlo
simulations. Conventional MU-MIMO based on linear precoders and Non-Orthogonal
Multiple Access (NOMA) schemes are considered as baselines. Numerical results
show that with imperfect CSIT, the sum-DoF and ESR performance of RSMA is
superior than that of the two baselines, and is increasing with the number of
transmitted common streams. Moreover, by better managing the interference, RSMA
not only has significant ESR gains over baseline schemes but is more robust to
CSIT inaccuracies, network loads and user deployments.

the extent of damage to buildings. With the powerful ability of feature

stage, a U-Net is used to extract the locations of buildings. Then the network
weights from the first stage are shared in the second stage for building damage
assessment. In the second stage, a two-branch multi-scale U-Net is employed as
backbone, where pre- and post-disaster images are fed into the network
separately. A cross-directional attention module is proposed to explore the
correlations between pre- and post-disaster images. Moreover, CutMix data
augmentation is exploited to tackle the challenge of difficult classes. The

rapid physical rotation has long been used in solid-state nuclear magnetic

driven by a secular spin-orbit resonance and mutual inclination, are an
excellent candidate for driving this orbital divergence, and that the high

reconstruct the image by estimating the missing rotations, aligning the images,

if the noise level is high, the rotations can still be approximated, and thus
can provide indispensable information. In particular, learning the
approximation error can be harnessed for efficient image estimation. In this
paper, we propose a new computational framework, called Synch-EM, that consists
of angular synchronization followed by expectation-maximization (EM). The
synchronization step results in a concentrated distribution of rotations; this
distribution is learned and then incorporated into the EM as a Bayesian prior.
The learned distribution also dramatically reduces the search space, and thus
the computational load, of the EM iterations. We show by extensive numerical

Collaborative Filtering~(CF) models predict the top ranked items a user might
like by leveraging implicit user-item interaction data. For each user, the
implicit feedback is divided into two sets: an observed item set with limited
observed behaviors, and a large unobserved item set that is mixed with negative
item behaviors and unknown behaviors. Given any user preference prediction
model, researchers either designed ranking based optimization goals or relied
on negative item mining techniques for better optimization. Despite the
performance gain of these implicit feedback based models, the recommendation
results are still far from satisfactory due to the sparsity of the observed
item set for each user. To this end, in this paper, we explore the unique
characteristics of the implicit feedback and propose Set2setRank framework for
recommendation. The optimization criteria of Set2setRank are two folds: First,
we design an item to an item set comparison that encourages each observed item
from the sampled observed set is ranked higher than any unobserved item from
the sampled unobserved set. Second, we model set level comparison that
encourages a margin between the distance summarized from the observed item set

adaptive sampling technique is designed to implement these two goals. We have
to note that our proposed framework is model-agnostic and can be easily applied
to most recommendation prediction approaches, and is time efficient in
practice. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach.

'black boxes' (e.g., as executable software or APIs without open-sourcing

significantly degrade the performance of student models learned by imitating
it. We propose a simple yet effective algorithm to build the nasty teacher,
called self-undermining knowledge distillation. Specifically, we aim to

catastrophic forgetting. While a line of studies has been proposed with respect
to avoiding catastrophic forgetting, most of the methods are based on intuitive
insights into the phenomenon, and their performances have been evaluated by
numerical experiments using benchmark datasets. Therefore, in this study, we
provide the theoretical framework for analyzing catastrophic forgetting by
using teacher-student learning. Teacher-student learning is a framework in
which we introduce two neural networks: one neural network is a target function
in supervised learning, and the other is a learning neural network. To analyze
continual learning in the teacher-student framework, we introduce the
similarity of the input distribution and the input-output relationship of the
target functions as the similarity of tasks. In this theoretical framework, we
also provide a qualitative understanding of how a single-layer linear learning
neural network forgets tasks. Based on the analysis, we find that the network
can avoid catastrophic forgetting when the similarity among input distributions
is small and that of the input-output relationship of the target functions is
large. The analysis also suggests that a system often exhibits a characteristic
phenomenon called overshoot, which means that even if the learning network has
once undergone catastrophic forgetting, it is possible that the network may
perform reasonably well after further learning of the current task.

Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning (SsCL), which combines the well-known
contrastive loss in self-supervised learning with the cross entropy loss in
semi-supervised learning, and jointly optimizes the two objectives in an
end-to-end way. The highlight is that different from self-training based
semi-supervised learning that conducts prediction and retraining over the same
model weights, SsCL interchanges the predictions over the unlabeled data
between the two branches, and thus formulates a co-calibration procedure, which
we find is beneficial for better prediction and avoid being trapped in local
minimum. Towards this goal, the contrastive loss branch models pairwise
similarities among samples, using the nearest neighborhood generated from the
cross entropy branch, and in turn calibrates the prediction distribution of the
cross entropy branch with the contrastive similarity. We show that SsCL
produces more discriminative representation and is beneficial to few shot
learning. Notably, on ImageNet with ResNet50 as the backbone, SsCL achieves
60.2% and 72.1% top-1 accuracy with 1% and 10% labeled samples, respectively,

consider the scenario where the power transmitted by the secondary transmitter

channel estimation error is also taken into account in our analysis. We derive
exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the ESSR of the downlink NOMA

introduced by Jan Willems with the explicit goal of arriving at a fundamental
understanding of the stability properties of feedback interconnections. In
robust control, the framework of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) builds
on the seminal contributions of Yakubovich and Zames in the 1960's. It provides
a technique for analyzing the stability of an interconnection of some linear
system in feedback with a whole class of systems, also refereed to as
uncertainty.
  In this paper we survey the key ideas of exploiting dissipativity and
integral quadratic constraints for the computational analysis of robust
stability and performance properties of uncertain interconnections in terms of
linear matrix inequalities. In particular for dynamic supply rates, the paper
revolves around the notion of finite-horizon integral quadratic constraints
with a terminal cost. We reveal that this provides a seamless link between the
general IQC theorem and dissipativity theory that has been established only
rather recently.

Cytopathology images are often used to screen for this cancer. Given that there

learning methods require a fixed dimension of input images, but the dimensions
of clinical medical images are inconsistent. The aspect ratios of the images
suffer while resizing them directly. Clinically, the aspect ratios of cells
inside cytopathological images provide important information for doctors to
diagnose cancer. Therefore, it is difficult to resize directly. However, many
existing studies have resized the images directly and have obtained highly
robust classification results. To determine a reasonable interpretation, we
have conducted a series of comparative experiments. First, the raw data of the
SIPaKMeD dataset are pre-processed to obtain standard and scaled datasets.
Then, the datasets are resized to 224 x 224 pixels. Finally, 22 deep learning
models are used to classify the standard and scaled datasets. The results of
the study indicate that deep learning models are robust to changes in the

also validated via the Herlev dataset.

discretizations of a fundamental partial differential equation, the

discretization is obtained by coupling a finite difference spatial
semi-discretization (the second- and some higher-order centered difference
schemes, or the Fourier spectral collocation method) with an arbitrary
$\theta$-method in time (including the forward and backward Euler methods, and
a second-order method by choosing $\theta\in [0,1]$ suitably). The full
discretization generates a two-parameter family of circulant matrices
$M\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$, where each matrix entry is a rational function in
$\theta$ and $\nu$. Here, $\nu$ denotes the CFL number, being proportional to
the ratio between the temporal and spatial discretization step sizes. The
entrywise non-negativity of the matrix $M$ -- which is equivalent to the
positivity preservation of the fully discrete scheme -- is investigated via
discrete Fourier analysis and also by solving some low-order parametric linear
recursions. We find that positivity preservation of the fully discrete system
is impossible if the number of spatial grid points $m$ is even. However, it
turns out that positivity preservation of the fully discrete system is
recovered for \emph{odd} values of $m$ provided that $\theta\ge 1/2$ and $\nu$
are chosen suitably. These results are interesting since the systems of
ordinary differential equations obtained via the spatial semi-discretizations
studied are \emph{not} positivity preserving.

sensitivity of optimal policies to these uncertain parameters, we propose a

optimization approaches to update strategies. This model extends team Markov
games to the scenario of incomplete information and meanwhile provides an
alternative solution concept of robust team optimality. To seek such a

prove its convergence. This algorithm, compared with robust dynamic

using approximation calculations to alleviate the curse of dimensionality.

presented. This situation is unsatisfactory especially when compared to the
case of the data-independent $P$-greedy algorithm, for which optimal
convergence rates are available, despite its performances being usually
inferior to the ones of target data-dependent algorithms.
  In this work we fill this gap by first defining a new scale of greedy
algorithms for interpolation that comprises all the existing ones in a unique
analysis, where the degree of dependency of the selection criterion on the
functional data is quantified by a real parameter. We then prove new
convergence rates where this degree is taken into account and we show that,
possibly up to a logarithmic factor, target data-dependent selection strategies
provide faster convergence.
  In particular, for the first time we obtain convergence rates for target data
adaptive interpolation that are faster than the ones given by uniform points,
without the need of any special assumption on the target function. The rates
are confirmed by a number of examples.

highly sought after, but difficult to find owing to large localization regions.
In this study, we present a strategy to search for compact object merger radio
counterparts in wide-field data collected by the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR).
In particular, we use multi-epoch LOFAR observations centred at 144 MHz
spanning roughly 300 deg$^2$ at optimum sensitivity of a since retracted
neutron star-black hole merger candidate detected during O2, the second
Advanced Ligo-Virgo GW observing run. The minimum sensitivity of the entire
(overlapping) 1809 deg$^2$ field searched is 50 mJy and the false negative rate
is 0.1 per cent above 200 mJy. We do not find any transients and thus place an
upper limit at 95 per cent confidence of 0.02 transients per square degree
above 20 mJy on one, two and three month timescales, which are the most
sensitive limits available to date. Finally, we discuss the prospects of
observing GW events with LOFAR in the upcoming GW observing run and show that a
single multi-beam LOFAR observation can probe the full projected median
localization area of binary neutron star mergers down to a median sensitivity
of at least 8 mJy.

BaBSim.Hospital, a tool for capacity planning based on discrete event

focusing the optimization on the most important parameters. We illustrate how
this reduces the problem dimension without compromising the resulting accuracy.
The presented approach is applicable to many other real-world problems, e.g.,

interface of heterogeneity plays essential role in wave dispersion and
attenuation. Formulating wave propagation in partially saturated and fractured
rocks is challenging and of great interests in geoscience. Here we raise a
Biot-patchy-squirt (BIPS) model to characterize wave dispersion/attenuation in

incorporates the mechanism of local fluid-interface flow (LFIF) and squirt flow
into global fluid flow simultaneously. Theoretical analysis show that wave
attenuations caused by viscous dissipation, squirt flow and patchy interface
vibration are distinct from each other. BIPS is intrinsically consistent with
Biot theory, squirt and LFIF model and reduces to such mechanism in limiting
conditions. More interestingly, numerical results show that coupling between
LFIF and squirt flow is of evident importance to P-wave dispersion and
attenuation. Comparisons with experimental data indicate that BIPS model is

the number of 1's transmitted over the channels. ZAC-DEST also provides a
number of knobs for trading off the application's accuracy for energy savings,
and vice versa, and can be applied to both training and inference.
  We apply ZAC-DEST to five machine learning applications. On average, across
all applications and configurations, we observed a reduction of $40$% in
termination energy and $37$% in switching energy as compared to the state of
the art data encoding technique BD-Coder with an average output quality loss of
$10$%. We show that if both training and testing are done assuming the presence
of ZAC-DEST, the output quality of the applications can be improved upto 9
times as compared to when ZAC-DEST is only applied during testing leading to
energy savings during training and inference with increased output quality.

functional versatility. However, the refractive indices of common polymers fall

loading commercially-available polymers with large concentrations of a

polystyrene loaded with 67w/w\% $\beta$-carotene, we achieve a peak value of
2.2 near the absorption edge at $531~\mathrm{nm}$, while maintaining values
above 1.75 across longer wavelengths of the visible spectrum. Despite high
pigment loadings, this blend maintains the thermoforming ability of
polystyrene, and $\beta$-carotene remains molecularly dispersed. Similar
results are demonstrated for the plant-derived polymer ethyl cellulose. Since
the refractive index enhancement is intimately connected to the introduction of
strong absorption, it is best suited to applications where light travels short
distances through the material, such as reflectors and nanophotonic systems.We
experimentally demonstrate enhanced reflectance from films, as large as
seven-fold for ethyl cellulose at selected wavelengths. Theoretical
calculations that highlight that this simple strategy can significantly
increase light scattering by nanoparticles and enhance the performance of Bragg

Information-theoretic measures can be used (along with Fano's inequality) to
derive upper bounds on the success rate of any possible attack in terms of the
number of side-channel measurements. Equivalently, this gives lower bounds on
the number of queries for a given success probability of attack. In this paper,
we consider cryptographic implementations protected by (first-order) masking
schemes, and derive several information-theoretic bounds on the efficiency of
any (second-order) attack. The obtained bounds are generic in that they do not
depend on a specific attack but only on the leakage and masking models, through
the mutual information between side-channel measurements and the secret key.
Numerical evaluations confirm that our bounds reflect the practical performance

and supported by a Wong-Zakai approximation argument that consists in smoothing
the singular Gaussian white noise and then taking limit of the solution from
the approximated model. We prove that the stochastic version of the classic SIS

identify the class of perturbing noises for which this property holds and

detection and localization systems by exploiting molecular communication setup.
The system consists of mobile sensors in a fluidic medium, which are injected
into the medium to search the environment for abnormality. Some fusion centers
(FC) are placed at specific locations in the medium, which absorb all sensors
arrived at their locations, and by observing its state, each FC decides on the
abnormality existence and/or its location. To reduce the effects of sensor
imperfection, we propose a scheme where the sensors release some molecules
(i.e., markers) into the medium after they sense an abnormality. If the goal is
abnormality detection, the released molecules are used to cooperatively
activate other sensors. If the goal is abnormality localization, the released
molecules are used by the FCs to determine the location. In our model, both
sensors' imperfection and markers background noise are taken into account. For
the detection phase, we consider two sensor types based on their activation
strategy by markers. To make the analysis tractable, we assume some ideal
assumptions for the sensors' model. We investigate the related binary
hypothesis testing problem and obtain the probabilities of false alarm and
miss-detection. It is shown that using sensors with the ability of
cooperatively activating each other can significantly improve the detection
performance in terms of probability of error. For the localization phase, we
consider two types of FCs based on their capability in reading sensors' storage
levels. We study their performance and obtain the optimal and sub-optimal
decision schemes and also the probability of localization error for both
perfect and imperfect sensing regimes.

resolve the molecular gas in the central starburst disk, the outflow, as well

striking amount of structure. Using a clump decomposition algorithm, we analyse
the physical properties (e.g., radii $R$, line widths $\sigma$, and masses $M$)

similar, irrespective of their environment. This also holds for the size-line
width relations of the clouds. The distribution of clouds in the $\sigma^2/R$

a significant role in setting their physical parameters in the outflow and the
streamers. We find that the clouds in the streamers stay approximately constant
in size ($R \sim 50$ pc) and mass ($M \sim 10^5$ M$_\odot$) and do not vary

incorporate multi-scale fusion approaches to address the challenges arising

Layerwise detection of linguistic anomalies","ACL 2021 (Long Paper)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transformer language models have shown remarkable ability in detecting when a
word is anomalous in context, but likelihood scores offer no information about
the cause of the anomaly. In this work, we use Gaussian models for density
estimation at intermediate layers of three language models (BERT, RoBERTa, and
XLNet), and evaluate our method on BLiMP, a grammaticality judgement benchmark.
In lower layers, surprisal is highly correlated to low token frequency, but
this correlation diminishes in upper layers. Next, we gather datasets of
morphosyntactic, semantic, and commonsense anomalies from psycholinguistic
studies; we find that the best performing model RoBERTa exhibits surprisal in
earlier layers when the anomaly is morphosyntactic than when it is semantic,
while commonsense anomalies do not exhibit surprisal at any intermediate layer.
These results suggest that language models employ separate mechanisms to detect
different types of linguistic anomalies.

the non-Hermitian model possesses classical vortex solutions in the

facial expressions from a neutral 3D face and an expression label. This
involves solving two sub-problems: (i)modeling the temporal dynamics of
expressions, and (ii) deforming the neutral mesh to obtain the expressive
counterpart. We represent the temporal evolution of expressions using the
motion of a sparse set of 3D landmarks that we learn to generate by training a
manifold-valued GAN (Motion3DGAN). To better encode the expression-induced
deformation and disentangle it from the identity information, the generated
motion is represented as per-frame displacement from a neutral configuration.
To generate the expressive meshes, we train a Sparse2Dense mesh Decoder
(S2D-Dec) that maps the landmark displacements to a dense, per-vertex
displacement. This allows us to learn how the motion of a sparse set of
landmarks influences the deformation of the overall face surface, independently
from the identity. Experimental results on the CoMA and D3DFACS datasets show
that our solution brings significant improvements with respect to previous
solutions in terms of both dynamic expression generation and mesh
reconstruction, while retaining good generalization to unseen data. The code

of motivation for this project. Skeletal and Musculoskeletal human models were
considered for motions in the sagittal plane, and results from both were
compared exhaustively. While skeletal models are driven with motor actuation,
musculoskeletal models perform through muscle-tendon actuation. Model-free
reinforcement learning algorithms were used to optimize inverse dynamics
control actions to satisfy the objective of imitating a reference motion along
with secondary objectives of minimizing effort in terms of power spent by
motors and metabolic energy consumed by the muscles. On the one hand, the
control actions for the motor actuated model is the target joint angles
converted into joint torques through a Proportional-Differential controller.
While on the other hand, the control actions for the muscle-tendon actuated
model is the muscle excitations converted implicitly to muscle activations and
then to muscle forces which apply moments on joints. Muscle-tendon actuated
models were found to have superiority over motor actuation as they are
inherently smooth due to muscle activation dynamics and don't need any external
regularizers. Finally, a strategy that was used to obtain an optimal
configuration of the significant decision variables in the framework was
discussed. All the results and analysis are presented in an illustrative,
