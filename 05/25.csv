hyperbolic 3-manifolds is already determined by their topology. In particular,
the volume of such manifolds is a topological invariant and, as such, has been
investigated for half a century.
  Motivated by the algorithmic study of 3-manifolds, Maria and Purcell have
recently shown that every closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M with volume vol(M)
admits a triangulation with dual graph of treewidth at most C vol(M), for some
universal constant C.
  Here we improve on this result by showing that the volume provides a linear
upper bound even on the pathwidth of the dual graph of some triangulation,
which can potentially be much larger than the treewidth. Our proof relies on a
synthesis of tools from 3-manifold theory: generalized Heegaard splittings,
amalgamations, and the thick-thin decomposition of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We
provide an illustrated exposition of this toolbox and also discuss the
algorithmic consequences of the result.

been hypothesized to be the cores of disrupted planetesimals and the parent
bodies of the iron meteorites. While recent evidence has collected against a
pure metal composition for Psyche, its spectrum and radar properties remain
anomalous. We observed (16) Psyche in thermal emission with the Atacama Large
(sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA) at a resolution of 30 km over 2/3 of its
rotation. The diurnal temperature variations are at the $\sim$10 K level over
most of the surface and are best fit by a smooth surface with a thermal inertia
of 280$\pm$100 J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$. We measure a millimeter
emissivity of 0.61$\pm$0.02, which we interpret via a model that treats the
surface as a porous mixture of silicates and metals, where the latter may take
the form of iron sulfides/oxides or alternatively as conducting metallic
inclusions. The emissivity indicates a metal content of no less than 20\% and
potentially much higher, but the polarized emission that should be present for
a surface with $\geq$20\% metal content is almost completely absent. This
requires a highly scattering surface, which may be due to the presence of
reflective metallic inclusions. If such is the case, a consequence is that
metal-rich asteroids may produce less polarized emission than metal-poor
asteroids, exactly the opposite prediction from standard theory, arising from
the dominance of scattering over the bulk material properties.

behavior for optimal pricing and hedging options. We construct a
non-deterministic Markov decision process for modeling stock price change
driven by the principal investor's decision making. However, low
signal-to-noise ratio and instability that are inherent in equity markets pose
challenges to determine the state transition (stock price change) after
executing an action (the principal investor's decision) as well as decide an
action based on current state (spot price). In order to conquer these
challenges, we resort to a Bayesian deep neural network for computing the
predictive distribution of the state transition led by an action. Additionally,
instead of exploring a state-action relationship to formulate a policy, we seek
for an episode based visible-hidden state-action relationship to
probabilistically imitate the principal investor's successive decision making.
Unlike conventional option pricing that employs analytical stochastic processes
or utilizes time series analysis to model and sample underlying stock price
movements, our algorithm simulates stock price paths by imitating the principal
investor's behavior which requires no preset probability distribution and fewer
predetermined parameters. Eventually the optimal option price is learned by
reinforcement learning to maximize the cumulative risk-adjusted return of a
dynamically hedged portfolio over simulated price paths.

  Retrieval",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conventional sparse phase retrieval schemes can recover sparse signals from
the magnitude of linear measurements only up to a global phase ambiguity. This
work proposes a novel approach that instead utilizes the magnitude of affine
measurements to achieve ambiguity-free signal reconstruction. The proposed
method relies on two-stage approach that consists of support identification
followed by the exact recovery of nonzero signal entries. In the noise-free
case, perfect support identification using a simple counting rule is guaranteed
subject to a mild condition on the signal sparsity, and subsequent exact
recovery of the nonzero signal entries can be obtained in closed-form. The
proposed approach is then extended to two noisy scenarios, namely, sparse noise
(or outliers) and non-sparse bounded noise. For both cases, perfect support
identification is still ensured under mild conditions on the noise model,
namely, the support size for sparse outliers and the power of the bounded
noise. Under perfect support identification, exact signal recovery can be
achieved using a simple majority rule for the sparse noise scenario, and
reconstruction up to a bounded error can be achieved using linear least-squares
(LS) estimation for the non-sparse bounded noise scenario. The obtained
analytic performance guarantee for the latter case also sheds light on the
construction of the sensing matrix and bias vector. In fact, we show that a
near optimal performance can be achieved with high probability by the random
generation of the nonzero entries of the sparse sensing matrix and bias vector
according to the uniform distribution over a circle. Computer simulations using
both synthetic and real-world data sets are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

logic and computer science for a long time. In this paper we are interested in
understanding the structure of satisfiable and unsatisfiable sentences. In
previous work we initiated a new approach to SAT by formulating a mapping from
propositional logic sentences to graphs, allowing us to find structural
obstructions to 2SAT (clauses with exactly 2 literals) in terms of graphs. Here
we generalize these ideas to multi-hypergraphs in which the edges can have more
than 2 vertices and can have multiplicity. This is needed for understanding the
structure of SAT for sentences made of clauses with 3 or more literals (3SAT),
which is a building block of NP-completeness theory. We introduce a decision
problem that we call GraphSAT, as a first step towards a structural view of
SAT. Each propositional logic sentence can be mapped to a multi-hypergraph by
associating each variable with a vertex (ignoring the negations) and each
clause with a hyperedge. Such a graph then becomes a representative of a
collection of possible sentences and we can then formulate the notion of
satisfiability of such a graph. With this coarse representation of classes of
sentences one can then investigate structural obstructions to SAT. To make the
problem tractable, we prove a local graph rewriting theorem which allows us to
simplify the neighborhood of a vertex without knowing the rest of the graph. We
use this to deduce several reduction rules, allowing us to modify a graph
without changing its satisfiability status which can then be used in a program
to simplify graphs. We study a subclass of 3SAT by examining sentences living
on triangulations of surfaces and show that for any compact surface there
exists a triangulation that can support unsatisfiable sentences, giving
specific examples of such triangulations for various surfaces.

solving the Bloch-Torrey equations considering surface relaxivity using the
""flux/source"" boundary conditions for different geometries, in the fast and

of two coupled fluids (McConnell equations), first in isolated pores, and then
in a ""cylindrical porous plug"" containing one single 20 microns spherical pore
surrounded by 800 X 2 microns, unconnected, also spherical ones. NMR spectra
and transverse relaxation are calculated as a function of pore sizes and
coupling strength between fluids, for single 90 degrees pulses, followed by the
FFT of the NMR signal (FID), and the echo amplitude after a spin-echo pulse
sequence, respectively. The simulations show that, in the fast diffusion

relaxation, but even in noiseless condition and full control of geometry, only
a rough estimate of sizes can be obtained. A number of possible follow-up

the signed graph representing the community is not structurally balanced and in

balance. The model exhibits bifurcations, and a ``social effort'' parameter,
added to the model to represent the strength of the interactions between the
agents, plays the role of bifurcation parameter in our analysis. We show that,
as the social effort increases, the decision-making dynamics exhibits a
pitchfork bifurcation behavior where, from a deadlock situation of ``no
decision'' (i.e., the origin is the only globally stable equilibrium point),
two possible (alternative) decision states for the community are achieved
(corresponding to two nonzero locally stable equilibria). The value of social
effort for which the bifurcation is crossed (and a decision is reached)
increases with the frustration of the signed network.

crucial for the modeling and prediction of wildland and urban fire behavior.
Despite its importance, the burning of solid fuels remains poorly understood,
which can be partly attributed to the unknown chemical kinetics of most solid
fuels. Most available kinetic models were built upon expert knowledge, which
requires chemical insights and years of experience. This work presents a
framework for autonomously discovering biomass pyrolysis kinetic models from
thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) experimental data using the recently developed
chemical reaction neural networks (CRNN). The approach incorporated the CRNN
model into the framework of neural ordinary differential equations to predict
the residual mass in TGA data. In addition to the flexibility of
neural-network-based models, the learned CRNN model is interpretable, by
incorporating the fundamental physics laws, such as the law of mass action and
Arrhenius law, into the neural network structure. The learned CRNN model can
then be translated into the classical forms of biomass chemical kinetic models,
which facilitates the extraction of chemical insights and the integration of
the kinetic model into large-scale fire simulations. We demonstrated the
effectiveness of the framework in predicting the pyrolysis and oxidation of
cellulose. This successful demonstration opens the possibility of rapid and
autonomous chemical kinetic modeling of solid fuels, such as wildfire fuels and
industrial polymers.

also provides some applications.
  The category's objects are games, which are understood to be sets of nodes
which have been endowed with edges, information sets, actions, players, and
utility functions. Its arrows are functions from source nodes to target nodes
that preserve the additional structure. For instance, a game's information-set
collection is newly regarded as a topological basis for the game's
decision-node set, and thus a morphism's continuity serves to preserve
information sets. Given these definitions, a game monomorphism is characterized
by the property of not mapping two source runs (plays) to the same target run.
Further, a game isomorphism is characterized as a bijection whose restriction
to decision nodes is a homeomorphism, whose induced player transformation is
injective, and which strictly preserves the ordinal content of the utility
functions.
  The category is then applied to some game-theoretic concepts beyond the
definition of a game. A Selten subgame is characterized as a special kind of
categorical subgame, and game isomorphisms are shown to preserve strategy sets,
Nash equilibria, Selten subgames, subgame-perfect equilibria,
perfect-information, and no-absentmindedness. Further, it is shown that the
full subcategory for distinguished-action sequence games is essentially wide in
the category of all games, and that the full subcategory of action-set games is
essentially wide in the full subcategory for games with no-absentmindedness.

understanding of electroweak Higgs boson plus two-jet production, and in
particular the vector-boson fusion mode (VBF). We perform a detailed comparison
of precision calculations for Higgs boson production in this channel, with
particular emphasis on large Higgs boson transverse momenta, and on the jet
radius dependence of the cross section. We study fixed-order predictions at NLO
and NNLO QCD, and compare the results to NLO plus parton shower (NLOPS) matched
calculations. The impact of the NNLO corrections on the central predictions is
mild, with inclusive scale uncertainties of the order of a few percent, which
can increase with the imposition of kinematic cuts. We find good agreement
between the fixed-order and matched calculations in non-Sudakov regions, and
the various NLOPS predictions also agree well in the Sudakov regime. We analyze
backgrounds to VBF Higgs boson production stemming from associated production,
and from gluon-gluon fusion. At high Higgs boson transverse momenta, the
$\Delta y_{jj}$ and/or $m_{jj}$ cuts typically used to enhance the VBF signal
over background lead to a reduced efficiency. We examine this effect as a
function of the jet radius and using different definitions of the tagging jets.
QCD radiative corrections increase for all Higgs production modes with
increasing Higgs boson $p_T$, but the proportionately larger increase in the
gluon fusion channel results in a decrease of the gluon-gluon fusion background
to electroweak Higgs plus two jet production upon requiring exclusive two-jet
topologies. We study this effect in detail and contrast in particular a central
jet veto with a global jet multiplicity requirement.

behaviors can emerge from local and dynamic interactions. We revisit here the
Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape Logic (STREL), a logic-based formal language
designed to express and monitor spatio-temporal requirements over the execution

which CPS entities (nodes of the graph) are arranged as a weighted graph
representing their dynamic topological configuration. Both nodes and edges
include attributes modeling physical and logical quantities that can evolve
over time. STREL combines the Signal Temporal Logic with two spatial modalities
reach and escape that operate over the weighted graph. From these basic
operators, we can derive other important spatial modalities such as everywhere,
somewhere and surround. We propose both qualitative and quantitative semantics
based on constraint semiring algebraic structure. We provide an offline
monitoring algorithm for STREL and we show the feasibility of our approach with
the application to two case studies: monitoring spatio-temporal requirements

this end, a novel formulation of the problem is developed. This formulation is
linear and generalises the well-known Yule-Walker (Y-W) equations and a recent
approach based on restricted AR models (Krenk-Moller approach, K-M). Two main
features characterise the introduced formulation: (i) flexibility in the choice
for the autocovariance equations employed in the model determination, and (ii)
flexibility in the definition of the AR model scheme. Both features were

meaningful to visualize results for easier understanding. Covid-19
visualization dashboard presented in this paper is an example of this.
  This paper covers all of the above steps of data analysis life cycle using a
data representation that is gaining importance for multi-entity, multi-feature
data sets - Multilayer Networks. We use several data sets to establish the
effectiveness of modeling using MLNs and analyze them using the proposed
decoupling approach. For coverage, we use different types of MLNs for modeling,
and community and centrality computations for analysis. The data sets used - US
commercial airlines, IMDb, DBLP, and Covid-19 data set. Our experimental
analyses using the identified steps validate modeling, breadth of objectives
that can be computed, and overall versatility of the life cycle approach.
Correctness of results is verified, where possible, using independently
available ground truth. We demonstrate drill-down that is afforded by this
approach (due to structure and semantics preservation) for a better
understanding and visualization of results.

configurations are drawing a renewed attention in order to both unveil emerging
topological spin textures and to highlight microscopic mechanisms leading to
their stabilization. The possible key role of the two-site exchange anisotropy
in selecting specific helicity and vorticity of skyrmionic lattices has only
recently been proposed. In this work we explore the phase diagram of a
frustrated localized magnet on a two-dimensional centrosymmetric triangular
lattice, focusing on the interplay between the two-ion anisotropy (TIA) and the
single-ion anisotropy (SIA). The effects of an external magnetic field applied
perpendicularly to the magnetic layer are also investigated. By means of Monte
Carlo simulations, we find a profusion of different spin configurations, going
from trivial to high-order Q skyrmionic and meronic lattices. In closer detail,
we find that a dominant role is played by the two-ion over the single-ion
anisotropy in determining the planar spin texture, whereas the strength and
sign of SIA, together with the magnitude of the magnetic field, tune the
perpendicular spin components, mostly affecting the polarity (and, in turn, the
topology) of the spin-texture. Our analysis confirms the crucial role of
anisotropic symmetric exchange in systems with dominant short-range
interactions, at the same time predicting a rich variety of complex magnetic
textures that may arise from a fine tuning of competing anisotropic mechanisms.

the control of communicable diseases. However, involving a strong perturbation
of daily life, it often causes psychosocial distress, and severe financial and
social costs. These may act as mechanisms limiting the adoption of the measure
in the first place or the adherence throughout its full duration. In addition,
difficulty of recognizing mild symptoms or lack of symptoms may impact
awareness of the infection and further limit adoption. Here, we study an
epidemic model on a network of contacts accounting for limited adherence and
delayed awareness to self-isolation, along with fatigue causing overhasty
termination. The model allows us to estimate the role of each ingredient and
analyze the tradeoff between adherence and duration of self-isolation. We find
that the epidemic threshold is very sensitive to an effective compliance that
combines the effects of imperfect adherence, delayed awareness and fatigue. If
adherence improves for shorter quarantine periods, there exists an optimal
duration of isolation, shorter than the infectious period. However,
heterogeneities in the connectivity pattern, coupled to a reduced compliance
for highly active individuals, may almost completely offset the effectiveness
of self-isolation measures on the control of the epidemic.

spatio-temporal, load-shifting flexibility provided by data centers (DaCes).
Load-shifting flexibility is a key asset for power grid operators as they aim
to integrate larger amounts of intermittent renewable power and to decarbonize
the grid. Central to our study is the concept of virtual links, which provide
non-physical pathways that can be used by DaCes to shift power loads (by
shifting computing loads) across space and time. We use virtual links to show
that the clearing formulation treats DaCes as prosumers that simultaneously
request load and provide a load-shifting flexibility service. Our analysis also
reveals that DaCes are remunerated for the provision of load-shifting
flexibility based on nodal price differences (across space and time). We also
show that DaCe flexibility helps relieve space-time price volatility and show
that the clearing formulation satisfies fundamental economic properties that
are expected from coordinated markets (e.g., provides a competitive equilibrium
and achieves revenue adequacy and cost recovery). The concepts presented are
applicable to other key market players that can offer space-time shifting
flexibility such as distributed manufacturing facilities and storage systems.
Case studies are presented to demonstrate these properties.

imposing a 1-Lipschitz constraint on each layer, training such networks
requires each layer to be gradient norm preserving (GNP) to prevent gradients
from vanishing. However, existing GNP convolutions suffer from slow training,
lead to significant reduction in accuracy and provide no guarantees on their

Orthogonal Convolution (SOC) that uses the following mathematical property:
when a matrix is {\it Skew-Symmetric}, its exponential function is an {\it
orthogonal} matrix. To use this property, we first construct a convolution
filter whose Jacobian is Skew-Symmetric. Then, we use the Taylor series
expansion of the Jacobian exponential to construct the SOC layer that is
orthogonal. To efficiently implement SOC, we keep a finite number of terms from
the Taylor series and provide a provable guarantee on the approximation error.

provably Lipschitz, large convolutional neural networks significantly faster

noiseless label at a given, fixed cost, and aim to achieve the best

However, in many real settings, different labelers have different labeling
costs and can yield different labeling accuracies. Moreover, a given labeler
may exhibit different labeling accuracies for different instances. This setting
can be referred to as active learning with diverse labelers with varying costs
and accuracies, and it arises in many important real settings. It is therefore
beneficial to understand how to effectively trade-off between labeling accuracy
for different instances, labeling costs, as well as the informativeness of
training instances, so as to achieve the best generalization performance at the
lowest labeling cost. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for selecting
instances, labelers (and their corresponding costs and labeling accuracies),
that employs generalization bound of learning with label noise to select
informative instances and labelers so as to achieve higher generalization
accuracy at a lower cost. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates state-of-the-art

constructs an approximate \textit{toroidal} $n$-queens configuration. In this
well-known variant the diagonals wrap around the board from left to right and
from top to bottom. We show that with high probability this algorithm succeeds
in placing $(1-o(1))n$ queens on the board. In the second stage, the method of
absorbers is used to obtain a complete solution to the non-toroidal problem. By
counting the number of choices available at each step of the random greedy
algorithm we conclude that there are more than $\left( \left( 1 - o(1) \right)
n e^{-3} \right)^n$ solutions to the $n$-queens problem. This proves a
conjecture of Rivin, Vardi, and Zimmerman in a strong form.

  bacilli",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Tuberculosis is a contagious disease which is one of the leading causes of
death, globally. The general diagnosis methods for tuberculosis include
microscopic examination, tuberculin skin test, culture method, enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electronic nose system. World Health
Organization (WHO) recommends standard microscopic examination for early
diagnosis of tuberculosis. In microscopy, the technician examines field of
views (FOVs) in sputum smear for presence of any TB bacilli and counts the
number of TB bacilli per FOV to report the level of severity. This process is
time consuming with an increased concentration for an experienced staff to
examine a single sputum smear. The examination demands for skilled technicians
in high-prevalence countries which may lead to overload, fatigue and diminishes
the quality of microscopy. Thus, a computer assisted system is proposed and
designed for the detection of tuberculosis bacilli to assist pathologists with
increased sensitivity and specificity. The manual efforts in detecting and
counting the number of TB bacilli is greatly minimized. The system obtains
Ziehl-Neelsen stained microscopic images from conventional microscope at 100x
magnification and passes the data to the detection system. Initially the
segmentation of TB bacilli was done using RGB thresholding and Sauvola's
adaptive thresholding algorithm. To eliminate the non-TB bacilli from coarse
level segmentation, shape descriptors like area, perimeter, convex hull, major
axis length and eccentricity are used to extract only the TB bacilli features.
Finally, the TB bacilli are counted using the generated bounding boxes to
report the level of severity.

multiple HISQ heavy quarks with masses from the $c$ mass up to that of the $b$

$\Gamma_{\ell=e}/|\eta_\mathrm{EW}V_{cb}|^2=2.07(17)_\mathrm{latt}(2)_\mathrm{EM}\times

$R(D_s^{*-})\equiv

combining our lattice results across the full q^2 range with experimental

graph on $n$ vertices with i.i.d. in- and out-degree pairs distributed as
$(D^-,D^+)$, with $\mathbb E[D^+]=\mathbb E[D^-]=\mu$. We condition on equal
total in- and out-degree. A phase transition for the emergence of a giant SCC
is known to occur at the critical value $\mathbb E[D^-D^+] = \mu$. We study the
model at this critical value and, additionally, require that $\mathbb
E[(D^-)^i(D^+)^j]<\infty$ for all $i+j\leq 3$, and for $(i,j)=(1,3)$ and
$(i,j)=(3,1)$. We show that, under these conditions, the SCCs ranked by
decreasing number of edges with distances rescaled by $n^{-1/3}$ converge in
distribution to a sequence of finite strongly connected directed multigraphs
with edge lengths, and that these are either $3$-regular or loops. The limit
objects lie in a $3$-parameter family, which contains the scaling limit of the
SCCs in the directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model at criticality as found by
Goldschmidt and Stephenson (2019). This is the first universality result for
the scaling limit of a critical directed graph model and the first quantitative
result on the directed configuration model at criticality. As a trivial
consequence, the largest SCCs at criticality contain $\Theta(n^{1/3})$ vertices
and edges in probability, and the diameter of the directed graph at criticality
is $\Omega(n^{1/3})$ in probability. We use a metric on the space of weighted
multigraphs in which two multigraphs are close if there are compatible
isomorphisms between their vertex and edge sets which roughly preserve the edge
lengths. We use the product topology on the sequence of multigraphs. Our method
of proof involves a depth-first exploration of the directed graph, resulting in
a spanning forest with additional identifications, of which we study the limit
under rescaling.

improvements in efficiency, safety, and design possibilities. However,
programming complex robots, such as manipulators with seven degrees of freedom,
to successfully complete construction tasks can be tedious, challenging, or
impossible for a human to do manually. Namely, the structure must be
constructed in a sequence that preserves structural properties, such as
stiffness, at each step. At the same time, this sequence must allow for the
robot to precisely manipulate elements within the in-progress structure while
respecting geometric constraints that, for example, ensure the robot does not
collide with what it has built. In this work, we present an automated and newly
generalized planning approach for jointly finding a construction sequence and
robot motion plan for additive construction that satisfies these requirements.
Our approach can be applied in a variety of additive construction processes,

assembly in this paper. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on

physical origin, reaching us from other galaxies (Petroff et al. 2019). Most
FRBs have only ever been seen once, while others flash repeatedly, though
sporadically (Spitler et al. 2016, CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021). Many
models invoke magnetically powered neutron stars (magnetars) as the engines
producing FRB emission (Margalit & Metzger 2018, CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al.
2020). Recently, CHIME/FRB announced the discovery (Bhardwaj et al. 2021) of
the repeating FRB 20200120E, coming from the direction of the nearby grand
design spiral galaxy M81. Four potential counterparts at other observing
wavelengths were identified (Bhardwaj et al. 2021) but no definitive
association with these sources, or M81, could be made. Here we report an
extremely precise localisation of FRB 20200120E, which allows us to associate
it with a globular cluster (GC) in the M81 galactic system and to place it ~2pc
offset from the optical center of light of the GC. This confirms (Bhardwaj et
al. 2021) that FRB 20200120E is 40 times closer than any other known
extragalactic FRB. Because such GCs host old stellar populations, this
association strongly challenges FRB models that invoke young magnetars formed
in a core-collapse supernova as powering FRB emission. We propose, instead,
that FRB 20200120E is a highly magnetised neutron star formed via either
accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf or via merger of compact stars in a
binary system (Margalit et al. 2019). Alternative scenarios involving compact
binary systems, efficiently formed inside globular clusters, could also be
responsible for the observed bursts.

Studying the burst intensities and polarimetric properties on a wide range of
timescales, from milliseconds down to nanoseconds, is key to understanding the
emission mechanism. However, high-time-resolution studies of FRBs are limited
by their unpredictable activity levels, available instrumentation and temporal
broadening in the intervening ionised medium. Here we show that the repeating

nanoseconds in duration, with brightness temperatures as high as $3\times
10^{41}$ K (excluding relativistic effects), comparable to `nano-shots' from
the Crab pulsar. Comparing both the range of timescales and luminosities, we
find that FRB 20200120E observationally bridges the gap between known Galactic
young pulsars and magnetars, and the much more distant extragalactic FRBs. This
suggests a common magnetically powered emission mechanism spanning many orders
of magnitude in timescale and luminosity. In this work, we probe a relatively
unexplored region of the short-duration transient phase space; we highlight
that there likely exists a population of ultra-fast radio transients at
nanosecond to microsecond timescales, which current FRB searches are
insensitive to.

gas cell. Each simulation accounts for the self-gravity of the gas, the
momentum and thermal energy from supernovae, the injection of mass by stellar
winds, and the non-equilibrium chemistry of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen. We
reduce the resolution-dependence of our model by grouping those HII regions
with overlapping ionisation front radii. The Str\""{o}mgren radii of the grouped
HII regions are at best marginally-resolved, so that the injection of
purely-thermal energy within these radii has no effect on the interstellar
medium. By contrast, the injection of momentum increases the fraction of cold
and molecular gas by more than 50 per cent at mass resolutions of $10^3~{\rm
M}_\odot$, and decreases its turbulent velocity dispersion by $\sim 10~{\rm
kms}^{-1}$. The mass-loading of galactic outflows is decreased by an order of
magnitude. The characteristic lifetime of the least-massive molecular clouds
($M/{\rm M}_\odot < 5.6 \times 10^4$) is reduced from $\sim 18$ Myr to $<10$
Myr, indicating that HII region feedback is effective in destroying these
clouds. Conversely, the lifetimes of intermediate-mass clouds ($5.6 \times 10^4

to a reduction in supernova clustering. The derived cloud lifetimes span the

disruptive dynamical interaction, there is on average a reduction of only half
of bright IP progenitors, which is clearly not enough to explain the observed
deficiency. However, if the rotation- and crystallization-driven dynamo
scenario recently proposed by Schreiber et al. is incorporated in the
simulations, the observed rareness of bright IPs in GCs can be reproduced. This
is because bright cataclysmic variables in GCs are typically very old systems
($\gtrsim$ 10 Gyr), with white dwarfs that almost fully crystallized before
mass transfer started, which does not allow strong magnetic fields to be
generated. The observed mass density of bright IPs in GCs can be recovered if
around one third of the bright cataclysmic variables dynamically formed through
mergers have magnetic field strengths similar to those of IPs. We conclude that
the observed paucity of bright IPs in GCs is a natural consequence of the newly
proposed rotation- and crystallization-driven dynamo scenario.

relations for each Type Ia supernova host and anchor galaxy. We present two
different analyses, one based on Wesenheit magnitudes resulting in $H_0=73.2\pm

hadronic interactions of cosmic ray (CR) protons with the interstellar gas and
contributions from CR electrons via bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (IC)
scattering. The relative importance of these processes in different galaxy
types is still unclear. We model these processes in three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the formation of isolated galactic
discs using the moving-mesh code AREPO, including dynamically coupled CR
protons and adopting different CR transport models. We calculate steady-state
CR spectra and also account for the emergence of secondary electrons and
positrons. This allows us to produce detailed $\gamma$-ray maps, luminosities
and spectra of our simulated galaxies at different evolutionary stages. Our
simulations with anisotropic CR diffusion and a low CR injection efficiency at
supernovae (SNe, $\zeta_{\mathrm{SN}}=0.05$) can successfully reproduce the
observed far infrared (FIR)-$\gamma$-ray relation. Starburst galaxies are close
to the calorimetric limit, where CR protons lose most of their energy due to
hadronic interactions and hence, their $\gamma$-ray emission is dominated by
neutral pion decay. However, in low SF galaxies, the increasing diffusive
losses soften the CR proton spectra due to energy-dependent diffusion, and
likewise steepen the pionic $\gamma$-ray spectra. In turn, IC emission hardens
the total spectra and can contribute up to $\sim40$ per cent of the total
luminosity in low SF galaxies. Furthermore, in order to match the observed
$\gamma$-ray spectra of starburst galaxies, we require a weaker energy
dependence of the CR diffusion coefficient, $D\propto{E}^{0.3}$, in comparison

whether this ""Extensive Mutual Information"" model (EMI), which in fact
describes a free fermion in $d=2$, may similarly correspond to an actual CFT in
general dimensions. Using the long-distance behavior of $I_{\rm

using a random unitary circuit description. Previous work has shown that when
the random unitary operators act on four or more sites, an arbitrary initial
state eventually thermalizes via a universal subdiffusive dynamics. In
contrast, a system evolving under three-site gates fails to thermalize due to
strong ""fragmentation"" of the Hilbert space. Here we show that three-site gate
dynamics causes a given initial state to evolve toward a highly nonthermal
state on a time scale consistent with Brownian diffusion. Strikingly, the
dynamics produces an effective attraction between isolated fractons or between
a single fracton and the boundaries of the system, in analogy with the Casimir
effect in quantum electrodynamics. We show how this attraction can be
understood by exact mapping to a simple classical statistical mechanics

study in detail the impact of spectral uncertainties on the sensitivity to new

to sterile neutrinos from ${\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow {\nu}_e$ transitions, by
more than two orders of magnitude. This stresses the importance of a joint
experimental and theoretical effort to improve our understanding of neutrino
nucleus cross sections, as well as hadron production uncertainties and beam
focusing effects. Nevertheless, even with our conservative and more realistic
implementation of systematic uncertainties, we find that an improvement over
current bounds in the new physics frameworks considered is generally expected
if spectral uncertainties are below the $5\%$ level.

different aspects of explicit dS proposals have come under intense scrutiny.
One key ingredient is D7-brane gaugino condensation, which is usually treated
using effective 4d supergravity. However, it is clearly more desirable to
derive the relevant scalar potential directly from a local 10d Lagrangian. Such
a local 10d description captures the interactions among the various localized
sources and the background fields which are smeared in the 4d Lagrangian. While
progress in this endeavour has recently been made, some form of non-locality
related to the 4-gaugino term has remained hidden in the available proposals.
We spell out the local counterterm removing the divergence that arises when
integrating out the 3-form flux and which, upon dimensional reduction, serves
to reproduce the relevant part of the 4d supergravity action. This is both a
step towards a more complete understanding of 10d type-IIB supergravity as well
as specifically towards better control of dS constructions in string theory
involving gaugino condensation.

However, many physical details of jet launching and the driving of disc winds
from the underlying accretion disc are still not fully understood. In this
study, we further investigate the role of the magnetic field strength and
structure in launching jets and disc winds. In particular, we explore the
connection between jet, wind, and the accretion disc around the central black
hole. We perform axisymmetric GRMHD simulations of the accretion-ejection
system using adaptive mesh refinement. Essentially, our simulations are
initiated with a thin accretion disc in equilibrium. An extensive parametric
study by choosing different combinations of magnetic field strength and initial
magnetic field inclination is also performed. Our study finds relativistic jets
driven by the Blandford \& Znajek (BZ) mechanism and the disc-wind driven by
the Blandford \& Payne (BP) mechanism. We also find that plasmoids are formed
due to the reconnection events, and these plasmoids advect with disc-winds. As
a result, the tension force due to the poloidal magnetic field is enhanced in
the inner part of the accretion disc, resulting in disc truncation and
oscillation. These oscillations result in flaring activities in the jet mass
flow rates. We find simulation runs with a lower value of the plasma-$\beta$,
and lower inclination angle parameters are more prone to the formation of
plasmoids and subsequent inner disc oscillations. Our models provide a possible

winds that, if sustained over time, can unbind the gas from the stellar bulges

between the masses of the central black holes and the velocity dispersion of
stars in galactic bulges. Propagating through the galaxy, the wind should
interact with the interstellar medium creating a strong shock, similar to those
observed in supernovae explosions, which is able to accelerate charged
particles to high energies. In this work we use data from the Fermi Large Area
Telescope to search for the gamma-ray emission from galaxies with an ultra-fast
outflow (UFO): a fast (v~0.1c), highly ionized outflow, detected in absorption
at hard X-rays in several nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN). Adopting a
sensitive stacking analysis we are able to detect the average gamma-ray
emission from these galaxies and exclude that it is due to processes other than
the UFOs. Moreover, our analysis shows that the gamma-ray luminosity scales
with the AGN bolometric luminosity and that these outflows transfer ~0.04% of
their mechanical power to gamma rays. Interpreting the observed gamma-ray
emission as produced by cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated at the shock front, we
find that the gamma-ray emission may attest to the onset of the wind-host
interaction and that these outflows can accelerate CRs in the transition region
between galactic and extragalactic CRs.

compactness constraints. This reduction, here named taming, in effect defines
quantum mechanics on a continuum target space. When appropriate lattice

canonical commutation relations, contact terms in correlation functions,
continuous spacetime symmetries, and supersymmetry algebras. All of these are

observed star formation rates in large, disky galaxies. To fuel star formation,
gas must reach the inner regions of such galaxies. Despite its crucial
importance for galaxy evolution, how and where gas joins galaxies is poorly
constrained observationally and is rarely explored in fully cosmological
simulations. To investigate gas accretion in the vicinity of galaxies, we
analyze the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations for 4 Milky Way mass
galaxies (M_halo ~ 10E12 solar masses), focusing on simulations with cosmic ray
physics. We find that at z~0, gas approaches the disk with angular momentum
similar to the gaseous disk edge and low radial velocities, piling-up near the
edge and settling into full rotational support. Accreting gas moves
predominantly parallel to the disk with small but nonzero vertical velocity
components, and joins the disk largely in the outskirts as opposed to ""raining""
down onto the disk. Once in the disk, gas trajectories are complex, being
dominated by spiral arm induced oscillations and feedback. However, time and
azimuthal averages show clear but slow net radial infall with transport speeds
of 1-3 km/s and net mass fluxes through the disk on the order of one solar mass
per year, comparable to the star formation rates of the galaxies and decreasing
towards galactic center as gas is sunk into star formation. These rates are
slightly higher in simulations without cosmic rays (1-7 km/s, ~4-5 solar masses
per year). We find overall consistency of our results with observational
constraints and discuss prospects of future observations of gas flows in and

experimental data streams contain images having arbitrary rotations and
translations within the image. At the same time, for many cases, small amounts
of labeled data are available in the form of prior published results, image
collections, and catalogs, or even theoretical models. Here we develop an
approach that allows generalizing from a small subset of labeled data with a
weak orientational disorder to a large unlabeled dataset with a much stronger
orientational (and positional) disorder, i.e., it performs a classification of
image data given a small number of examples even in the presence of a
distribution shift between the labeled and unlabeled parts. This approach is
based on the semi-supervised rotationally invariant variational autoencoder

rotationally (and translationally) invariant continuous latent representation
of data and a classifier that encodes data into a finite number of discrete

synthetic data sets with known factors of variation. We further demonstrate its

parameter heterogeneity among oscillators can consistently rescue the system

the desire of reducing the complexity of practical computations. The key idea
is to specify renormalisation conditions for all inessential couplings, leaving
us with the task of computing only the flow of the essential ones. To achieve
this aim, we utilise a renormalisation group equation for the effective average
action which incorporates general non-linear field reparameterisations. A
prominent feature of the scheme is that, apart from the renormalisation of the
mass, the propagator evaluated at any constant value of the field maintains its
unrenormalised form. Conceptually, the simplifications can be understood as
providing a description based only on quantities that enter expressions for
physical observables since the redundant, non-physical content is automatically
disregarded. To exemplify the scheme's utility, we investigate the
Wilson-Fisher fixed point in three dimensions at order two in the derivative
expansion. In this case, the scheme removes all order $\partial^2$ operators
apart from the canonical term. Further simplifications occur at higher orders
in the derivative expansion. Although we concentrate on a minimal scheme that
reduces the complexity of computations, we propose more general schemes where
inessential couplings can be tuned to optimise a given approximation. We
further discuss the applicability of the scheme to a broad range of physical
theories.

representation theory. It is known that a quasi-abelian category $\mathcal{E}$
is a cotilting torsionfree class of an abelian category. In fact, this property
characterizes quasi-abelian categories. This ambient abelian category is
derived equivalent to the category $\mathcal{E}$, and can be constructed as the
heart $\mathcal{LH}(\mathcal{E})$ of a $\operatorname{t}$-structure on the
bounded derived category $\operatorname{D^b}(\mathcal{E})$ or as the
localization of the category of monomorphisms in $\mathcal{E}.$
  However, there are natural examples of categories in functional analysis
which are not quasi-abelian, but merely one-sided quasi-abelian or even weaker.
Examples are the category of $\operatorname{LB}$-spaces or the category of
complete Hausdorff locally convex spaces. In this paper, we consider additive
regular categories as a generalization of quasi-abelian categories that covers
the aforementioned examples. These categories can be characterized as
pre-torsionfree subcategories of abelian categories.
  As for quasi-abelian categories, we show that such an ambient abelian
category of an additive regular category $\mathcal{E}$ can be found as the
heart of a $\operatorname{t}$-structure on the bounded derived category
$\operatorname{D^b}(\mathcal{E})$, or as the localization of the category of
monomorphisms of $\mathcal{E}$. In our proof of this last construction, we
formulate and prove a version of Auslander's formula for additive regular
categories.
  Whereas a quasi-abelian category is an exact category in a natural way, an
additive regular category has a natural one-sided exact structure. Such a
one-sided exact category can be 2-universally embedded into its exact hull. We
show that the exact hull of an additive regular category is again an additive
regular category.

centrals and satellites from a population of high and low excitation radio
galaxies (HERGs and LERGs) in Simba, and study their global properties. We find
that $\sim 20 \%$ of radio galaxies are satellites, and that there are
insignificant differences in the global properties of LERGs based on their
central/satellite classification. HERG satellites display lower values of star
formation, 1.4GHz radio luminosity, and Eddington fractions than HERG centrals.
We further investigate the environments of radio galaxies and show that HERGs
typically live in less dense environments, similar to star-forming galaxies.
The environments of high-mass LERGs are similar to non-radio galaxies, but
low-mass LERGs live in underdense environments similar to HERGs. LERGs with
over-massive black holes reside in the most dense environments, while HERGs
with over-massive black holes reside in underdense environments. The richness
of a LERG's environment decreases with increasing Eddington fraction, and the
environments of all radio galaxies do not depend on radio luminosity for
$P_{\rm 1.4~GHz} < 10^{24} \rm{~W~Hz}^{-1}$. Complementing these results, we
find that LERGs cluster on the same scale as the total galaxy population, while
multiple HERGs are not found within the same dark matter halo. Finally, we show
that high density environments support the growth of HERGs rather than LERGs at
$z=2$. Simba predicts that with more sensitive surveys, we will find
populations of radio galaxies in environments much similar to the total galaxy
population.

tools for classification of observations that stem from systems with temporal
dependence as they take into account that observations close in time are likely
generated from the same state (i.e.\ class). When information on the classes of
the observations is available in advanced, supervised methods can be applied.
In this paper, we provide details for the implementation of four models for
classification in a supervised learning context: HMMs, hidden semi-Markov

simulations, we study the classification performance under various degrees of

to classify accelerometer data from Merino sheep to distinguish between four
different behaviors of interest. In particular in the field of movement
ecology, collection of fine-scale animal movement data over time to identify
behavioral states has become ubiquitous, necessitating models that can account
for the dependence structure in the data. We demonstrate that when the aim is
to conduct classification, various degrees of model misspecification of the

high overlap between the state-dependent distributions, that is, unless the
observation distributions of the different states are difficult to

center network (DCN), including two types of heterogeneous servers, called core
and edge servers. Remarkably, it takes the latter as backup servers to deal
with server failures and thus achieve high availability. This paper first
points out that RCube is suitable as a candidate topology of DCNs for edge
computing. Three transmission types are among core and edge servers based on
the demand for applications' computation and instant response. We then employ
protection routing to analyze the transmission failure of RCube DCNs. Unlike
traditional protection routing, which only tolerates a single link or node
failure, we use the multi-protection routing scheme to improve fault-tolerance
capability. To configure a protection routing in a network, according to
Tapolcai's suggestion, we need to construct two completely independent spanning
trees (CISTs). A logic graph of RCube, denoted by $L$-$RCube(n,m,k)$, is a
network with a recursive structure. Each basic building element consists of $n$
core servers and $m$ edge servers, where the order $k$ is the number of
recursions applied in the structure. In this paper, we provide algorithms to
construct $\min\{n,\lfloor(n+m)/2\rfloor\}$ CISTs in $L$-$RCube(n,m,k)$ for
$n+m\geqslant 4$ and $n>1$. From a combination of the multiple CISTs, we can
configure the desired multi-protection routing. In our simulation, we configure
up to 10 protection routings for RCube DCNs. As far as we know, in past
research, there were at most three protection routings developed in other
network structures. Finally, we summarize some crucial analysis viewpoints

that are able to maximally reduce the generalization error. The information
theoretic measure of mutual information (MI) is one of the most effective
criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the samples in a pool-based sample
selection scenario. However, the computational complexity of the standard MI
algorithm prevents the utilization of this method on large datasets. A local

kernels to the observed output data while enhancing the computational
complexity of the standard MI algorithm. The proposed algorithm is developed to
work on a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework, where the kernel
hyperparameters are updated after each label query using the maximum likelihood
estimation. In the sequential learning procedure, the updated hyperparameters
can be used in the MI kernel matrices to improve the sample suggestion
performance. The advantages are demonstrated on a simulation of the 2018

alternative to labour-intensive cleanroom production. Here, we present 2D metal
micro-particle focusing in a round glass capillary using bulk acoustic waves.
Excitation of the piezoelectric transducer at specific frequencies leads to
mode shapes in the round capillary, concentrating particles towards the
capillary centre. We experimentally investigate the particle linewidth for
different particle materials and concentrations. We demonstrate the focus of
copper particles with 1 $\mu$m in diameter down to a line of width 60.8 $\pm$
7.0 $\mu$m and height 45.2 $\pm$ 9.3 $\mu$m, corresponding to a local

insights into the particle manipulation mechanism inside the capillary and

streaming pattern enables us to manipulate particles close to the critical
particle radius. Finally, we used our method to eject copper particles through
a tapered round capillary with an opening of 25 $\mu$m in diameter, which would
not be possible without particle focusing. Our novel setup can be utilized for
various applications, that otherwise might suffer from abrasion, clogging and

options. It is well-known that, when sufficiently young children encounter a
new word, they tend to interpret it as pointing to a meaning that does not have
a word yet in their lexicon rather than to a meaning that already has a word
attached. In previous research, the strategy was shown to be optimal from an
information theoretic standpoint. In that framework, interpretation is
hypothesized to be driven by the minimization of a cost function: the option of
least communication cost is chosen. However, the information theoretic model
employed in that research neither explains the weakening of that vocabulary
learning bias in older children or polylinguals nor reproduces Zipf's
meaning-frequency law, namely the non-linear relationship between the number of
meanings of a word and its frequency. Here we consider a generalization of the
model that is channeled to reproduce that law. The analysis of the new model
reveals regions of the phase space where the bias disappears consistently with
the weakening or loss of the bias in older children or polylinguals. The model
is abstract enough to support future research on other levels of life that are
relevant to biosemiotics. In the deep learning era, the model is a transparent
low-dimensional tool for future experimental research and illustrates the
predictive power of a theoretical framework originally designed to shed light
on the origins of Zipf's rank-frequency law.

product of irreducible representation of the complex general linear group
GL(n,C) with a symmetric power of the standard representation on C^n. It is an
important and long understood special case of the Littlewood-Richardson rule
for decomposing general tensor products of representations of GL(n,C). In our
recent work [Gurevich-Howe17, Gurevich-Howe19] on the organization of
representations of the general linear group over a finite field F_q using small
representations, we used a generalization of the Pieri rule to the context of
this latter group. In this note, we demonstrate how to derive the Pieri rule
for GL(n,Fq). This is done in two steps; the first, reduces the task to the
case of the symmetric group S_n, using the natural relation between the
representations of S_n and the spherical principal series representations of
GL(n,F_q); while in the second step, inspired by a remark of Nolan Wallach, the
rule is obtained for S_n invoking the S_\ell-GL_(n,C)) Schur duality. Along the
way, we advertise an approach to the representation theory of the symmetric
group which emphasizes the central role played by the dominance order on Young

data-driven modeling (DDM) to create generalizable, trustworthy, accurate,
computationally efficient and self-evolving models. CoSTA achieves this
objective by augmenting the governing equation of a PBM model with a corrective
source term generated using a deep neural network. In a series of numerical
experiments on one-dimensional heat diffusion, CoSTA is found to outperform
comparable DDM and PBM models in terms of accuracy -- often reducing predictive
errors by several orders of magnitude -- while also generalizing better than
pure DDM. Due to its flexible but solid theoretical foundation, CoSTA provides
a modular framework for leveraging novel developments within both PBM and DDM.
Its theoretical foundation also ensures that CoSTA can be used to model any
system governed by (deterministic) partial differential equations. Moreover,
CoSTA facilitates interpretation of the DNN-generated source term within the
context of PBM, which results in improved explainability of the DNN. These
factors make CoSTA a potential door-opener for data-driven techniques to enter
high-stakes applications previously reserved for pure PBM.

collected over time while the system is evolving in closed-loop, and are
directly used to iteratively update the controller. A major benefit of the
proposed online implementation is therefore the ability of the controller to
automatically adjust to changes in the operating mode of the system. We show
that the proposed control mechanism guarantees stability of the closed-loop
switched linear system provided that the switching is slow enough.
Effectiveness of the proposed design technique is illustrated for two aerospace

discussion threads when faced with a new bug to repair. Typically, these
discussion threads consist of comments and even bug-fixing comments intended to
capture clues for facilitating the investigation and root cause of a new bug
report. Over time, these discussions can become extensively lengthy and
difficult to understand. Inevitably, these discussion threads lead to instances
where bug-fixing comments intermingle with seemingly-unrelated comments. This
task, however, poses further challenges when dealing with high volumes of bug
reports. Large software systems are plagued by thousands of bug reports daily.
Hence, it becomes time-consuming to investigate these bug reports efficiently.
To address this gap, this paper builds a ranked-based automated tool that we
refer it to as RETRORANK. Specifically, RETRORANK recommends bug-fixing
comments from issue tracking discussion threads in the context of user query
relevance, the use of positive language, and semantic relevance among comments.
By using a combination of Vector Space Model (VSM), Sentiment Analysis (SA),
and the TextRank Model (TR) we show how that past fixed bugs and their
associated bug-fixing comments with relatively positive sentiments can
semantically connect to investigate the root cause of a new bug. We evaluated
our approach via a synthetic study and a user study. Results indicate that
RETRORANK significantly improved performance when compared to the baseline VSM.

in clustering since prevalent clustering methods (e.g., k-means) have to run in
a batch mode. Besides, there can be a trivial solution consisting of a
dominating cluster. To address these challenges, we first investigate the
objective of clustering-based representation learning. Based on this, we
propose a novel clustering-based pretext task with online \textbf{Co}nstrained

clustering that each cluster has exactly the same size, we only constrain the
minimal size of each cluster to flexibly capture the inherent data structure.
More importantly, our online assignment method has a theoretical guarantee to
approach the global optimum. By decoupling clustering and discrimination, CoKe
can achieve competitive performance when optimizing with only a single view
from each instance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and other benchmark data
sets verify both the efficacy and efficiency of our proposal. Code is available

stellar populations. NGC4105 has a slightly negative age gradient, comparable
to that of the most massive elliptical galaxies, but a steeper metallicity
gradient. The SB0 galaxy NGC4106 presents smaller radial variations in both age
and metallicity in comparison with intermediate mass early-type galaxies. These

happened very recently and was not extensive in mass. Electron density

Besides, it gives rise to the deployment of misleading classifiers. An example
of the latter is the creation of open-source labelled catalogues with biased

deterministic rules that are based on physical descriptors of RR Lyrae stars,

constant, the families of divergence-based evenness measures nest. This
property allows them to be ranked based on their reactivity to changes in
relatively even assemblages or changes in relatively uneven ones. We establish
this ranking and explore how the distance-based measures relate to it for both

captures the angular distance between the vector of relative abundances and a
perfectly even vector and is highly reactive to changes in even assemblages.

included in the models, simulations of neutron star mergers can produce a broad
range of ejecta properties. The characteristics of this ejecta, in turn, define
the kilonova emission. To explore the effect of ejecta properties, we present a
grid of 2-component 2D axisymmetric kilonova simulations that vary mass,
velocity, morphology, and composition. The masses and velocities of each
component vary, respectively, from 0.001 to 0.1 M$_{\odot}$ and 0.05 to 0.3$c$,
covering much of the range of results from the neutron star merger literature.
The set of 900 models is constrained to have a toroidal low electron fraction
($Y_e$) ejecta with a robust r-process composition and either a spherical or
lobed high-$Y_e$ ejecta with two possible compositions. We simulate these
models with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SuperNu using a full suite
of lanthanide and 4th row element opacities. We examine the trends of these
models with parameter variation, show how it can be used with statistical

damage from other changes in the Earth's surface. In this study, we propose a
novel approach to damage mapping, combining deep learning with the full time
history of SAR observations of an impacted region in order to detect anomalous
variations in the Earth's surface properties due to a natural disaster. We
quantify Earth surface change using time series of Interferometric SAR
coherence, then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a probabilistic anomaly
detector on these coherence time series. The RNN is first trained on pre-event
coherence time series, and then forecasts a probability distribution of the
coherence between pre- and post-event SAR images. The difference between the
forecast and observed co-event coherence provides a measure of the confidence
in the identification of damage. The method allows the user to choose a damage
detection threshold that is customized for each location, based on the local
behavior of coherence through time before the event. We apply this method to
calculate estimates of damage for three earthquakes using multi-year time
series of Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions. Our approach shows good agreement with

with trajectories of a system and represent such uncertainties in the form of
interval trajectories. We then propose two uncertainty-aware signal temporal
logic (STL) inference approaches to classify the undesired behaviors and
desired behaviors of a system. Instead of classifying finitely many

trajectories. In the first approach, we incorporate robust semantics of STL
formulas with respect to an interval trajectory to quantify the margin at which
an STL formula is satisfied or violated by the interval trajectory. The second
approach relies on the first learning algorithm and exploits the decision tree
to infer STL formulas to classify behaviors of a given system. The proposed
approaches also work for non-separable data by optimizing the worst-case
robustness in inferring an STL formula. Finally, we evaluate the performance of
the proposed algorithms in two case studies, where the proposed algorithms show
reductions in the computation time by up to four orders of magnitude in

their linear energy dispersion and non-trivial Berry phase. Graphene-like 2D
Dirac materials are gapless only within certain approximations, e.g., if
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected. It has recently been reported that
materials with nonsymmorphic crystal lattice possess symmetry-enforced
Dirac-like band dispersion around certain high-symmetry momenta even in the
presence of SOC. Here we calculate the optical absorption coefficient of
nonsymmorphic semimetals, such as $\alpha$-bismuthene, which hosts two
anisotropic Dirac cones with different Fermi velocities along $x$ and $y$
directions.We find that the optical absorption coefficient depends strongly on
the anisotropy factor and the photon polarization. When a magnetic field is
applied perpendicular to the plane of the material, the absorption coefficient
also depends on an internal parameter we termed the mixing angle of the band
structure. We further find that an in-plane magnetic field, while leaving the
system gapless, can induce a Van-Hove singularity in the joint density of
states: this causes a significant enhancement of the optical absorption at the
frequency of the singularity for one direction of polarization but not for the
orthogonal one, making the optical properties even more strongly dependent on
polarization. Due to the anisotropy present in our model, the Dirac cones at
two high-symmetry momenta in the Brillouin zone contribute very differently to
the optical absorbance. Consequently, it might be possible to preferentially
populate one valley or the other by varying photon polarization and frequency.
These results suggest that nonsymmorphic 2D Dirac semimetals are excellent
candidate materials for tunable magneto-optic devices.

predicting and classifying mental disorders. However, the vast majority of
current shape approaches rely heavily on vertex-wise analysis that may not
successfully capture complexities of subcortical structures. Additionally, the
past works do not include interactions between these structures and exposure
factors. Predictive modeling with such interactions is of paramount interest in
heterogeneous mental disorders such as PTSD, where trauma exposure interacts
with brain shape changes to influence behavior. We propose a comprehensive
framework that overcomes these limitations by representing brain substructures
as continuous parameterized surfaces and quantifying their shape differences
using elastic shape metrics. Using the elastic shape metric, we compute shape
summaries of subcortical data and represent individual shapes by their
principal scores. These representations allow visualization tools that help
localize changes when these PCs are varied. Subsequently, these PCs, the
auxiliary exposure variables, and their interactions are used for regression
modeling. We apply our method to data from the Grady Trauma Project, where the
goal is to predict clinical measures of PTSD using shapes of brain
substructures. Our analysis revealed considerably greater predictive power
under the elastic shape analysis than widely used approaches such as
vertex-wise shape analysis and even volumetric analysis. It helped identify
local deformations in brain shapes related to change in PTSD severity. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first brain shape analysis approaches that can
seamlessly integrate the pre-processing steps under one umbrella for improved
accuracy and are naturally able to account for interactions between brain shape
and additional covariates to yield superior predictive performance when
modeling clinical outcomes.

simultaneous updates to many quantum numbers into conditional updates of a

groups should be targeted first in order to minimize the number of deaths. In
the scenarios that we test, we find that distributing vaccines demographically
and in an age-descending order is not optimal for minimizing deaths and the
burden of disease. Instead, more lives could potentially be saved by using
strategies which emphasize high-incidence regions and distribute vaccines in
parallel to multiple age groups. The level of emphasis that high-incidence
regions should be given depends on the overall transmission rate in the
population. This observation highlights the importance of updating the
vaccination strategy when the effective reproduction number changes due to the
general contact patterns changing and new virus variants entering.

computational geometric approach based adaptive tiling mechanism named VAD360,

processes is a well studied problem in information theory. However, estimating
the entropy rate for stationary continuous-valued stochastic processes has not
received as much attention. In fact, many current techniques are not able to
accurately estimate or characterise the complexity of the differential entropy
rate for strongly correlated processes, such as Fractional Gaussian Noise and
ARFIMA(0,d,0). To the point that some cannot even detect the trend of the
entropy rate, e.g. when it increases/decreases, maximum, or asymptotic trends,
as a function of their Hurst parameter. However, a recently developed technique
provides accurate estimates at a high computational cost. In this paper, we
define a robust technique for non-parametrically estimating the differential
entropy rate of a continuous valued stochastic process from observed data, by
making an explicit link between the differential entropy rate and the Shannon
entropy rate of a quantised version of the original data. Estimation is
performed by a Shannon entropy rate estimator, and then converted to a
differential entropy rate estimate. We show that this technique inherits many
important statistical properties from the Shannon entropy rate estimator. The
estimator is able to provide better estimates than the defined relative
measures and much quicker estimates than known absolute measures, for strongly
correlated processes. Finally, we analyse the complexity of the estimation
technique and test the robustness to non-stationarity, and show that none of
the current techniques are robust to non-stationarity, even if they are robust
to strong correlations.

region, we optimize the quantization of all user data streams at the SCBS by
developing a novel water-filling algorithm that is based on the Descartes' rule

than that to the MCBS, the SCBS deploys finer quantization to that user data
stream. We further propose a new simplified scheme through Wyner-Ziv (WZ)
binning and time-division (TD) transmission at the SCBS, which allows not only
sequential but also separate decoding of each user message at the MCBS. For
this new QF-WZTD scheme, the optimal quantization parameters are identical to
that of the QF-JD scheme while the phase durations are conveniently optimized
as functions of the quantization parameters. Despite its simplicity, the
QF-WZTD scheme achieves the same rate performance of the QF-JD scheme, making
it an attractive option for future HetNets.

sense the human body, follow trajectories around the body, and track human
motion. This study introduces a capacitive servoing control scheme that allows
a robot to sense and navigate around human limbs during close physical
interactions. Capacitive servoing leverages temporal measurements from a
multi-electrode capacitive sensor array mounted on a robot's end effector to
estimate the relative position and orientation (pose) of a nearby human limb.
Capacitive servoing then uses these human pose estimates from a data-driven
pose estimator within a feedback control loop in order to maneuver the robot's
end effector around the surface of a human limb. We provide a design overview
of capacitive sensors for human-robot interaction and then investigate the
performance and generalization of capacitive servoing through an experiment
with 12 human participants. The results indicate that multidimensional
capacitive servoing enables a robot's end effector to move proximally or
distally along human limbs while adapting to human pose. Using a
cross-validation experiment, results further show that capacitive servoing
generalizes well across people with different body size.

determine the occurrence of giant planets as a function of orbital separation
spanning 0.03-30 au. Giant planets are more prevalent at orbital distances of
1-10 au compared to orbits interior or exterior of this range. The increase in
planet occurrence at $\sim$1 au by a factor of $\sim$4 is highly statistically
significant. A fall-off in giant planet occurrence at larger orbital distances
is favored over models with flat or increasing occurrence. We measure
$14.1^{+2.0}_{-1.8}$ giant planets per 100 stars with semi-major axes of 2-8 au
and $8.9^{+3.0}_{-2.4}$ giant planets per 100 stars in the range 8-32 au, a
decrease in giant planet occurrence with increasing orbital separation that is
significant at the $\sim$2$\sigma$ level. We find that the occurrence rate of
sub-Jovian planets (0.1-1 Jupiter masses) is also enhanced for 1-10 au orbits.
This suggests that lower mass planets may share the formation or migration
mechanisms that drive the increased prevalence near the water-ice line for
their Jovian counterparts. Our measurements of cold gas giant occurrence are
consistent with the latest results from direct imaging surveys and
gravitational lensing surveys despite different stellar samples. We corroborate
previous findings that giant planet occurrence increases with stellar mass and
metallicity.

graph $G=(V,E)$. We set up a unified framework to study the leading order of
the decay rate of $P_t$, the expectation of the fraction of occupied sites at
time $t$, particularly for the `Big Bang' regime where $t\ll
t_{\text{coal}}:=\mathbb{E}[\inf\{s:\text{There is only one particle at time
}s\}]$. Our results show that $P_t$ satisfies certain mean field behavior, if
the graphs satisfy certain transience-like conditions.
  We apply this framework to two families of graphs: (1) graphs given by the
configuration model with a degree distribution supported in $[3,\bar d]$ for
some $\bar d\geq 3$, and (2) finite and infinite vertex-transitive graphs. In
the first case, we show that for $1 \ll t \ll |V|$, $P_t$ decays in the order
of $t^{-1}$, and $(tP_t)^{-1}$ is approximately the probability that two
particles starting from the root of the corresponding unimodular Galton-Watson
tree never collide after one of them leaves the root, which is also roughly
$|V|/(2t_{\text{meet}})$, where $t_{\text{meet}}$ is the mean meeting time of
two walkers. By taking the local weak limit, for the unimodular Galton-Watson
tree we prove the convergence of $tP_t$ as $t\to\infty$. For the second family
of graphs, if we take a sequence of finite graphs $G_n=(V_n, E_n)$, such that
$t_{\text{meet}}=O(|V_n|)$ and the inverse of the spectral gap $t_{\text{rel}}$
is $o(|V_n|)$, then for $t_{\text{rel}}\ll t\ll t_{\text{coal}}$, $(tP_t)^{-1}$
is approximately the probability that two random walks never meet before time
$t$, and also $|V|/(2t_{\text{meet}})$. In addition, we define a natural
uniform transience condition, and show that it implies the above for all $1\ll
t\ll t_{\text{coal}}$. Such estimates of $tP_t$ are also obtained for all
infinite transient transitive unimodular graphs, in particular, all transient
transitive amenable graphs.

information. We present a new study of young star variability in the $\sim$1-2
Myr-old, massive Lagoon Nebula region. Our sample encompasses 278 young, late-B
to K-type stars, monitored with Kepler/K2. Auxiliary $u,g,r,i,H\alpha$ time
series photometry, simultaneous with K2, was acquired at the Paranal
Observatory. We employed this comprehensive dataset and archival infrared
photometry to determine individual stellar parameters, assess the presence of
circumstellar disks, and tie the variability behaviors to inner disk dynamics.
We found significant mass-dependent trends in variability properties, with B/A
stars displaying substantially reduced levels of variability compared to G/K
stars for any light curve morphology. These properties suggest different
magnetic field structures at the surface of early-type and later-type stars. We
also detected a dearth of some disk-driven variability behaviors, particularly
dippers, among stars earlier than G. This indicates that their higher surface
temperatures and more chaotic magnetic fields prevent the formation and
survival of inner disk dust structures co-rotating with the star. Finally, we
examined the characteristic variability timescales within each light curve, and
determined that the day-to-week timescales are predominant over the K2 time
series. These reflect distinct processes and locations in the inner disk
environment, from intense accretion triggered by instabilities in the innermost
disk regions, to variable accretion efficiency in the outer magnetosphere.

estimation problem. The first part studies the estimation of a change point on
the real line in a simple stump model using the robust Huber estimating
function which interpolates between the $\ell_1$ (absolute deviation) and
$\ell_2$ (least squares) based criteria. While the $\ell_2$ criterion has been
studied extensively, its robust counterparts and in particular, the $\ell_1$
minimization problem have not. We derive the limit distribution of the
estimated change point under the Huber estimating function and compare it to
that under the $\ell_2$ criterion. Theoretical and empirical studies indicate
that it is more profitable to use the Huber estimating function (and in
particular, the $\ell_1$ criterion) under heavy tailed errors as it leads to
smaller asymptotic confidence intervals at the usual levels compared to the
$\ell_2$ criterion. We also compare the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ approaches in a
parallel setting, where one has $m$ independent single change point problems
and the goal is to control the maximal deviation of the estimated change points
from the true values, and establish rigorously that the $\ell_1$ estimation
criterion provides a superior rate of convergence to the $\ell_2$, and that
this relative advantage is driven by the heaviness of the tail of the error
distribution. Finally, we derive minimax optimal rates for the change plane
estimation problem in growing dimensions and demonstrate that Huber estimation
attains the optimal rate while the $\ell_2$ scheme produces a rate sub-optimal
estimator for heavy tailed errors. In the process of deriving our results, we
establish a number of properties about the minimizers of compound Binomial and
compound Poisson processes which are of independent interest.

Finally, to enhance the security of DLaaS, we use two uncertainties of the
Bayesian neural network to construct the combined uncertainty, which is used to
detect adversarial samples and achieves a high detection rate of 99.28%.

simultaneously provide multiple tissue property maps. When optimizing MRF
scans, modeling undersampling errors and field imperfections in cost functions
will make the optimization results more practical and robust. However, this
process is computationally expensive and impractical for sequence optimization
algorithms when MRF signal evolutions need to be generated for each
optimization iteration. Here, we introduce a fast MRF simulator to simulate
aliased images from actual scan scenarios including undersampling and system
imperfections, which substantially reduces computational time and allows for
direct error estimation and efficient sequence optimization. By constraining
the total number of tissues present in a brain phantom, MRF signals from highly
undersampled scans can be simulated as the product of the spatial response
functions based on sampling patterns and sequence-dependent temporal functions.
During optimization, the spatial response function is independent of sequence
design and does not need to be recalculated. We evaluate the performance and
computational speed of the proposed approach by simulations and in vivo
experiments. We also demonstrate the power of applying the simulator in MRF
sequence optimization. The simulation results from the proposed method closely
approximate the signals and MRF maps from in vivo scans, with 158 times shorter
processing time than the conventional simulation method using Non-uniform
Fourier transform. Incorporating the proposed simulator in the MRF optimization
framework makes direct estimation of undersampling errors during the
optimization process feasible, and provide optimized MRF sequences that are

online; however, their potential is often hindered by antisocial behaviors. In
this paper, we study the relationship between structure and toxicity in
conversations on Twitter. We collect 1.18M conversations (58.5M tweets, 4.4M
users) prompted by tweets that are posted by or mention major news outlets over
one year and candidates who ran in the 2018 US midterm elections over four
months. We analyze the conversations at the individual, dyad, and group level.
At the individual level, we find that toxicity is spread across many low to
moderately toxic users. At the dyad level, we observe that toxic replies are
more likely to come from users who do not have any social connection nor share
many common friends with the poster. At the group level, we find that toxic
conversations tend to have larger, wider, and deeper reply trees, but sparser
follow graphs. To test the predictive power of the conversational structure, we
consider two prediction tasks. In the first prediction task, we demonstrate
that the structural features can be used to predict whether the conversation
will become toxic as early as the first ten replies. In the second prediction
task, we show that the structural characteristics of the conversation are also
predictive of whether the next reply posted by a specific user will be toxic or
not. We observe that the structural and linguistic characteristics of the
conversations are complementary in both prediction tasks. Our findings inform
the design of healthier social media platforms and demonstrate that models
based on the structural characteristics of conversations can be used to detect
early signs of toxicity and potentially steer conversations in a less toxic
direction.

benthic (seafloor) surveys, where the vehicle collects optical imagery of near
the seafloor. Due to the small-sensor footprint of the cameras and the vast
areas to be surveyed, these AUVs can not feasibly full coverage of areas larger
than a few tens of thousands of square meters. Therefore AUV paths which sample
sparsely, yet effectively, the survey areas are necessary. Broad scale acoustic
bathymetric data is ready available over large areas, and often is a useful
prior of seafloor cover. As such, prior bathymetry can be used to guide AUV
data collection. This research proposes methods for planning initial AUV
surveys that efficiently explore a feature space representation of the
bathymetry, in order to sample from a diverse set of bathymetric terrain. This
will enable the AUV to visit areas that likely contain unique habitats and are
representative of the entire survey site. The suitability of these methods to
plan AUV surveys is evaluated based on the coverage of the feature space and
also the ability to visit all classes of benthic habitat on the initial dive.
This is a valuable tool for AUV surveys as it increases the utility of initial
dives. It also delivers a comprehensive training set to learn a relationship
between acoustic bathymetry and visually-derived seafloor classifications.

establishing cross-view correspondences where photometric constancy is
violated. This paper proposes a simple and practical solution to overcome this
challenge based on a co-located camera-light scanner device. Unlike existing
solutions, we do not explicitly solve for correspondence. Instead, we argue the
problem is generally well-posed by multi-view geometrical and photometric
constraints, and can be solved from a small number of input views. We formulate
the reconstruction task as a joint energy minimization over the surface
geometry and reflectance. Despite this energy is highly non-convex, we develop
an optimization algorithm that robustly recovers globally optimal shape and
reflectance even from a random initialization. Extensive experiments on both
simulated and real data have validated our method, and possible future

noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSCs) rank among the most promising
candidate materials. Surprisingly, some of them -- especially those containing
rhenium -- seem to exhibit also time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in their
superconducting state, while TRS is preserved in many other isostructural
NCSCs. To date, a satisfactory explanation for such discrepant behavior, albeit
crucial for understanding the unconventional superconductivity of these

regarding the Re-based class, where the muon-spin relaxation ($\mu$SR)
technique plays a key role due to its high sensitivity to the weak internal
fields associated with the TRS breaking phenomenon. We discuss different cases
of Re-containing superconductors, comprising both centrosymmetric- and
noncentrosymmetric crystal structures and ranging from pure rhenium, to Re$T$
($T$ = 3$d$-5$d$ early transition metals), to the dilute-Re case of
ReBe$_{22}$. $\mu$SR results suggest that the rhenium presence and its amount

supermomentum and angular momentum. However, there are some difficulties in
formulating this phase space so as to get the proper degrees of freedom. I
consider how to address this point, and also to identify circumstances in which
the radiative modes are sufficiently decoupled that they can be assigned their
own angular momentum. Two different phase spaces are considered. One, which
seems to reflect what previous workers have done (it leads to the usual
formulas for the Ashtekar-Streubel fluxes), is mathematically simpler, but this
has unwanted degrees of freedom and is difficult to interpret physically. The
second is a quotient of the first; it is better justified (at least in terms of
degrees of freedom), and plausibly decouples the radiative angular momentum
from internal modes (at least for systems which ultimately become stationary).
The symplectic form for this quotient, and the corresponding angular momentum
flux, involve highly non-local correlations. Both phase spaces are shown to
have Poisson brackets implementing the BMS algebra. For both phase spaces, for
axisymmetric space-times vacuum near null infinity, there can be no
gravitational radiation of angular momentum about the axis of symmetry,

opinion dynamics on social networks. Three key factors are considered: bounded
confidence that describes the cognitive scope of the population, stubbornness
level that characterizes the opinion updating speed, and the opinion strength
that represents the asymmetry power or attractiveness of the two choices. We
find that bounded confidence plays an important role in determining competing
evolution results. As bounded confidence grows, population opinions experience
polarization to consensus, leading to the emergence of phase transition from
co-existence to winner-takes-all state under binary decisions. Of particular
interest, we show how the combined effects of bounded confidence and asymmetry
opinion strength may reverse the initial supportive advantage in competitive
dynamics. Notably, our model qualitatively reproduces the important dynamical
pattern during a brutal competition, namely, cascading collapse, as observed by
real data. Finally and intriguingly, we find that individual cognitive
heterogeneity can bring about randomness and unpredictability in binary
decision-making process, leading to the emergence of indeterministic
oscillation. Our results reveal how the diverse behavioral patterns of binary
decision-making can be interpreted by the complicated interactions of the
proposed elements, which provides important insights toward competitive
dynamics

supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In this paper, we present a uniform
\emph{Chandra} X-ray data analysis of a sample of 152 $z\geq4.5$ quasars. We
firmly detect 46 quasars of this sample in 0.5-2~keV above 3~$\sigma$ and
calculate the upper limits of the X-ray flux of the remaining. We also estimate
the power law photon index of the X-ray spectrum of 31 quasars. 24 of our
sample quasars are detected in the FIRST or NVSS radio surveys; all of them are
radio-loud. We statistically compare the X-ray properties of our $z\geq4.5$
quasars to other X-ray samples of AGN at different redshifts. The relation
between the rest-frame X-ray luminosity and other quasar parameters, such as
the bolometric luminosity, UV luminosity, or SMBH mass, show large scatters.
These large scatters can be attributed to the narrow luminosity range at the
highest redshift, the large measurement error based on relatively poor X-ray
data, and the inclusion of radio-loud quasars in the sample. The $L_{\rm
X}-L_{\rm UV}$ relationship is significantly sub-linear. We do not find a
significant redshift evolution of the $L_{\rm X}-L_{\rm UV}$ relation,
expressed either in the slope of this relation, or the departure of individual
AGNs from the best-fit $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{\rm UV}$ relation
($\Delta\alpha_{\rm OX}$). The median value of the X-ray photon index is
$\Gamma\approx1.79$, which does not show redshift evolution from $z=0$ to
$z\sim7$. The X-ray and UV properties of the most distant quasars could
potentially be used as a standard candle to constrain cosmological models. The
large scatter of our sample on the Hubble diagram highlights the importance of
future large unbiased deep X-ray and radio surveys in using quasars in
cosmological studies.

gap over time. The operator needs to understand the fluid flow throughout the

times. This is insufficient for understanding the reservoir behavior. To
overcome those challenges, we have developed spatio-temporal
neural-network-based models that can produce high-fidelity interpolated or
extrapolated images effectively and efficiently. Specifically, our models are
built on an autoencoder, and incorporate the long short-term memory (LSTM)

performance of our models using real 4D post-stack seismic imaging data
acquired at the Sleipner CO$_2$ sequestration field. We employ two different

However, the temporal variation of the RV zero-points (RVZPs) of the MRS

for 3.6 million RVs and can reach a mean precision of $\sim

  Junction (MTJ)-Based Molecular Spintronics Device (MTJMSD)","5 Pages, four figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Magnetic tunnel junction-based molecular spintronics devices (MTJMSDs) are
designed by covalently connecting the paramagnetic molecules across two
ferromagnets (FM) electrodes of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). MTJMSD
provides opportunities to connect FM electrodes of a vast range of anisotropy
properties to a variety of molecules of length scale. Our prior studies showed
that the paramagnetic molecules can produce strong antiferromagnetic coupling
with FM electrodes. The device properties of MTJMSD depend upon various factors
such as anisotropy, spin fluctuation, thermal energy, etc. In this paper, we
report a theoretical Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) study to explain the impact
of anisotropy on the MTJMSD equilibrium properties. We studied the energy
variation of the MTJMSD system with time as a function of FM electrode
anisotropy. Experimentally designed FM electrodes of MTJMSD contain
multi-layers of different ferromagnetic materials. These materials possess
in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy characteristics. To understand
the competing effect of in-plane and out-of-plane anisotropy, we have
computationally applied anisotropies on the left FM electrode. For the MCS
study, the orientation of the device was kept along YZ plane. As a result, the
applied anisotropy along the X-direction (\mathbit{A}_{\mathbit{Lx}}) and
Y-direction (\mathbit{A}_{\mathbit{Ly}}) represent out-of-plane and in-plane
anisotropy, respectively. We found that increasing anisotropy strength starts
exhibiting diverse domain structures within an FM electrode. Increasing the
magnitude of anisotropy was found to create stripe-shaped domains with opposite
spins. These domains represent the different magnetic phases. However, the
application of equal magnitude of in-plane and out-of-plane cancels the strip
domain formation and lowers the magnetic moment of overall MTJMSD.

equivariance in the network architecture to enhance the the network robustness
on geometry transformation of data and reduce overfitting. It has been an
intuitive and widely used technique to construct a steerable filter by
augmenting a filter with its transformed copies in the past decades, which is
named as filter transform in this paper. Recently, the problem of steerable CNN
has been studied from aspect of group representation theory, which reveals the
function space structure of a steerable kernel function. However, it is not yet
clear on how this theory is related to the filter transform technique. In this
paper, we show that kernel constructed by filter transform can also be
interpreted in the group representation theory. This interpretation help
complete the puzzle of steerable CNN theory and provides a novel and simple
approach to implement steerable convolution operators. Experiments are executed
on multiple datasets to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach.

  is under review. Paper summary: 13 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Connected and Automated Hybrid Electric Vehicles have the potential to reduce
fuel consumption and travel time in real-world driving conditions. The
eco-driving problem seeks to design optimal speed and power usage profiles
based upon look-ahead information from connectivity and advanced mapping
features. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to the
eco-driving problem. While the previous studies synthesize simulators and
model-free DRL to reduce online computation, this work proposes a Safe
Off-policy Model-Based Reinforcement Learning algorithm for the eco-driving
problem. The advantages over the existing literature are three-fold. First, the
combination of off-policy learning and the use of a physics-based model
improves the sample efficiency. Second, the training does not require any
extrinsic rewarding mechanism for constraint satisfaction. Third, the
feasibility of trajectory is guaranteed by using a safe set approximated by
deep generative models.
  The performance of the proposed method is benchmarked against a baseline
controller representing human drivers, a previously designed model-free DRL
strategy, and the wait-and-see optimal solution. In simulation, the proposed
algorithm leads to a policy with a higher average speed and a better fuel
economy compared to the model-free agent. Compared to the baseline controller,
the learned strategy reduces the fuel consumption by more than 21\% while
keeping the average speed comparable.

gravitational waves from 15 young supernova remnants in the first half of the
third Advanced LIGO and Virgo observing run. We use three search pipelines with
distinct signal models and methods of identifying noise artifacts. Without
ephemerides of these sources, the searches are conducted over a frequency band
spanning from 10~Hz to 2~kHz. We find no evidence of continuous gravitational
radiation from these sources. We set upper limits on the intrinsic signal
strain at 95\% confidence level in sample sub-bands, estimate the sensitivity
in the full band, and derive the corresponding constraints on the fiducial
neutron star ellipticity and $r$-mode amplitude. The best 95\% confidence
constraints placed on the signal strain are $7.7\times 10^{-26}$ and $7.8\times
10^{-26}$ near 200~Hz for the supernova remnants G39.2--0.3 and G65.7+1.2,

fooled. As one of the mainstream methods, feature space targeted attacks
perturb images by modulating their intermediate feature maps, for the
discrepancy between the intermediate source and target features is minimized.
However, the current choice of pixel-wise Euclidean Distance to measure the
discrepancy is questionable because it unreasonably imposes a
spatial-consistency constraint on the source and target features. Intuitively,
an image can be categorized as ""cat"" no matter the cat is on the left or right
of the image. To address this issue, we propose to measure this discrepancy
using statistic alignment. Specifically, we design two novel approaches called
Pair-wise Alignment Attack and Global-wise Alignment Attack, which attempt to
measure similarities between feature maps by high-order statistics with
translation invariance. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the layer-wise
transferability with varied difficulties to obtain highly reliable attacks.
Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it
outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin. Our code is

the ferromagnetic electrodes of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) produce a new
system that differs dramatically from the properties of isolated molecules and
ferromagnets. However, it is unknown how far deep in the ferromagnetic
electrode the impact of the paramagnetic molecule and ferromagnet interactions
can travel for various levels of molecular spin states. Our prior experimental
studies showed two types of paramagnetic SMMs, the hexanuclear Mn6 and
octanuclear Fe-Ni molecular complexes, covalently bonded to ferromagnets
produced unprecedented strong antiferromagnetic coupling between two
ferromagnets at room temperature leading to a number of intriguing
observations. In this paper, we report Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) study
focusing on the impact of the molecular spin state on cross junction shaped MTJ
based molecular spintronics device (MTJMSD). Our MCS study focused on the
Heisenberg model of MTJMSD and investigated the impact of various molecular
coupling strengths, thermal energy, and molecular spin states. To gauge the
impact of the molecular spin state on the region of ferromagnetic electrodes,
we examined the spatial distribution of molecule-ferromagnet correlated phases.
Our MCS study shows that under a strong coupling regime molecular spin state
should be approximately 30 percent of the ferromagnetic electrode atomic spins
to create long-range correlated phases.

interacting via purely repulsive, linear spring forces, as a function of
pressure $P$ during athermal, quasistatic isotropic compression. Prior work has
shown that the ensemble-averaged shear modulus for jammed disk packings scales
as a power-law, $\langle G(P) \rangle \sim P^{\beta}$, with $\beta \sim 0.5$,
over a wide range of pressure. For packings of circulo-lines, we also find
robust power-law scaling of $\langle G(P)\rangle$ over the same range of
pressure for aspect ratios ${\cal R} \gtrsim 1.2$. However, the power-law
scaling exponent $\beta \sim 0.8$-$0.9$ is much larger than that for jammed
disk packings. To understand the origin of this behavior, we decompose $\langle
G\rangle$ into separate contributions from geometrical families, $G_f$, and
from changes in the interparticle contact network, $G_r$, such that $\langle G
\rangle = \langle G_f\rangle + \langle G_r \rangle$. We show that the shear
modulus for low-pressure geometrical families for jammed packings of
circulo-lines can both increase {\it and} decrease with pressure, whereas the
shear modulus for low-pressure geometrical families for jammed disk packings
only decreases with pressure. For this reason, the geometrical family
contribution $\langle G_f \rangle$ is much larger for jammed packings of
circulo-lines than for jammed disk packings at finite pressure, causing the
increase in the power-law scaling exponent.

autonomous driving systems. Different from previous approaches which are mostly
developed for lidars with high beam resolution, e.g. Velodyne HDL-64, this
paper proposes ground detection techniques applicable to much sparser point
cloud captured by lidars with low beam resolution, e.g. Velodyne VLP-16. The
approach is based on the RANSAC scheme of plane fitting. Inlier verification
for plane hypotheses is enhanced by exploiting the point-wise tangent, which is
a local feature available to compute regardless of the density of lidar beams.
Ground surface which is not perfectly planar is fitted by multiple
(specifically 4 in our implementation) disjoint plane regions. By assuming
these plane regions to be rectanglar and exploiting the integral image
technique, our approach approximately finds the optimal region partition and
plane hypotheses under the RANSAC scheme with real-time computational
complexity.

most efficient way to train deep SNNs is through ANN-SNN conversion. However,
the conversion usually suffers from accuracy loss and long inference time,
which impede the practical application of SNN. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze ANN-SNN conversion and derive sufficient conditions of the optimal

Rate Norm Layer to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANN training,
enabling direct conversion from a trained ANN to an SNN. Moreover, we propose
an optimal fit curve to quantify the fit between the activation value of source

lead to an early matter domination epoch, which enhances the primordial

The sudden decay of the Q-balls into fermions results in a rapid transition

achieves a power that approaches one as the sample size tends to infinity. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our method through intensive simulations and

amplification of their effect is proposed. It is based on the repeated
application of the same interaction pulse in two manners: with the same phase
of each subsequent pulse, and with an alternating phase shift of $\pi$ (i.e. a
minus sign) from pulse to pulse. Two specific types of pulses are considered: a
resonant $\pi$ pulse and an adiabatic chirped pulse, both of which produce
complete population inversion with high fidelity. In the presence of a weak
ambient external electric or magnetic field, the ensuing Stark or Zeeman shift
leads to an energy level shift and hence a static detuning. In both the
resonant and adiabatic approaches, a small level shift does not alter the
transition probability very much; however, it can significantly change the
dynamical phases in the propagator. The repeated application of the same pulse
greatly amplifies the changes in the dynamical phases and maps them onto the
populations. Hence the effect of the level shift can be measured with good
accuracy. It is found that sequences of pulses with alternating phases deliver
much greater error amplification and much steeper excitation profiles around
resonance, thereby providing much higher sensitivity to small energy level
shifts. Explicit analytic estimates of the sensitivity are derived using the
well-known non-crossing Rosen-Zener and Rabi models and the level-crossing
Demkov-Kunike model. This recipe provides a simple tool for rapid and accurate
sensing of weak electric and magnetic fields by using the same pulse generating
an inversion quantum gate, without sophisticated tomography or entangling
operations.

with calibrated uncertainties on the EDR3 reference frame: the Hipparcos proper
motion, the Gaia EDR3 proper motion, and the long-term proper motion given by
the difference in position between Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3. Our approach is
similar to that for the Gaia DR2 edition of the HGCA, but offers a factor of ~3
improvement in precision thanks to the longer time baseline and improved data
processing of Gaia EDR3. We again find that a 60/40 mixture of the two
Hipparcos reductions outperforms either reduction individually, and we find
strong evidence for locally variable frame rotations between all pairs of
proper motion measurements. The substantial global frame rotation seen in DR2
proper motions has been removed in EDR3. We also correct for color- and
magnitude-dependent frame rotations at a level of up to ~50 $\mu$as/yr in Gaia
EDR3. We calibrate the Gaia EDR3 uncertainties using a sample of radial
velocity standard stars without binary companions; we find an error inflation
factor (a ratio of total to formal uncertainty) of 1.37. This is substantially
lower than the position dependent factor of ~1.7 found for Gaia DR2 and
reflects the improved data processing in EDR3. While the catalog should be used
with caution, its proper motion residuals provide a powerful tool to measure
the masses and orbits of faint, massive companions to nearby stars.

of a flexible circular cantilever cylinder in a uniform cross-flow. We employ a
fully-coupled fluid-structure solver based on the three-dimensional
Navier-Stokes equations and the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. We examine the
dynamics of the cylinder for a wide range of reduced velocities ($U^*$), mass
ratios ($m^*$), and Reynolds numbers ($Re$). Of particular interest is to
explore the possibility of flow-induced vibrations in a slender cantilever
cylinder of aspect ratio $AR=100$ at laminar subcritical $Re$ regime (i.e., no
periodic vortex shedding). We assess the extent to which such a flexible
cylindrical beam can sustain flow-induced vibrations and characterize the
contribution of the beam's flexibility to the stability of the wake at low
$Re$. We show that when certain conditions are satisfied, the flexible
cantilever cylinder undergoes sustained large-amplitude vibrations. The
frequency of the oscillations is found to match the frequency of the periodic
fluid forces for a particular range of system parameters. In this range, the
frequency of the transverse vibrations is shown to match the first-mode natural
frequency of the cylinder, indicating the existence of the lock-in phenomenon.
The range of the lock-in regime is shown to have a strong dependence on $Re$
and $m^*$. We discover that unlike the steady wake behind a stationary rigid
cylinder, the wake of a low mass ratio flexible cantilever cylinder could lose
its stability in the lock-in regime at Reynolds numbers as low as $Re=22$. A
combined VIV-galloping type instability is shown to be the possible cause of
the wake instability at this $Re$ regime. These findings attempt to generalize
our understanding of the flow-induced vibrations in flexible cantilever
structures and can have a profound impact on the development of novel

studied for potential applications in quantum information science. The
Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip is the most important test tool for direct proof of
entanglement between paired photons, whose coincidence detection results in
anticorrelation due to photon bunching on a beam splitter. Although
anticorrelation is due to destructive quantum interference between paired
photons, a wavelength-sensitive interference fringe has never been observed in
any HOM-type experiments. Here, a typical HOM dip is investigated for entangled
photon pairs generated by parametric down conversion processes (SPDC) to
understand fundamental physics of anticorrelation. In addition, a pure
coherence optics-based Hong-Ou-Mandel scheme is proposed and analyzed for
general understanding of anticorrelation in an interferometric system. This
study sheds light on deterministic quantum correlation control and opens the
door to potential applications of on-demand quantum information science.

complex large-scale coherent flows. A particularly important laboratory
realization of such an active fluid is a system composed of microtubules,
aligned in a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) nematic phase, and driven by ATP-fueled
kinesin motor proteins. This system exhibits robust chaotic advection and gives
rise to a pronounced fractal structure in the nematic contours. We characterize
such experimentally derived fractals using the power spectrum and discover that
the power spectrum decays as $k^{-\beta}$ for large wavenumbers $k$. The
parameter $\beta$ is measured for several experimental realizations. Though
$\beta$ is effectively constant in time, it does vary with experimental
parameters, indicating differences in the scale-free behavior of the
microtubule-based active nematic. Though the fractal patterns generated in this
active system are reminiscent of passively advected dye in 2D chaotic flows,
the underlying mechanism for fractal generation is more subtle. We provide a
simple, physically inspired mathematical model of fractal generation in this
system that relies on the material being locally compressible, though the total
area of the material is conserved globally. The model also requires that
large-scale density variations be injected into the material periodically. The
model reproduces the power spectrum decay $k^{-\beta}$ seen in experiments.
Linearizing the model of fractal generation about the equilibrium density, we
derive an analytic relationship between $\beta$ and a single dimensionless
quantity $r$, which characterizes the compressibility.

frequency, which is called frequency principle or spectral bias. This frequency
principle sheds light on a high-frequency curse of DNNs -- difficult to learn
high-frequency information. Inspired by the frequency principle, a series of
works are devoted to develop algorithms for overcoming the high-frequency
curse. A natural question arises: what is the upper limit of the decaying rate
w.r.t. frequency when one trains a DNN? In this work, our theory, confirmed by
numerical experiments, suggests that there is a critical decaying rate w.r.t.
frequency in DNN training. Below the upper limit of the decaying rate, the DNN
interpolates the training data by a function with a certain regularity.
However, above the upper limit, the DNN interpolates the training data by a
trivial function, i.e., a function is only non-zero at training data points.
Our results indicate a better way to overcome the high-frequency curse is to
design a proper pre-condition approach to shift high-frequency information to
low-frequency one, which coincides with several previous developed algorithms
for fast learning high-frequency information. More importantly, this work
rigorously proves that the high-frequency curse is an intrinsic difficulty of
DNNs.

propagation occurring in the cardiovascular system at an intra-cardiac scale. A
promising approach for directly mapping the current dynamics is to monitor the
associated stray magnetic field. However, in this magnetic field approach, the
spatial resolution deteriorates significantly as the standoff distance between
the target and the sensor increases. Existing sensors usually remain relatively
far from the target and provide only centimetre-scale resolution because their
operating temperature is not biocompatible. Here we demonstrate
millimetre-scale magnetocardiography of living rats using a solid-state quantum
sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. The essence of the method
is a millimetre proximity from the sensor to heart surface, which enhances the
cardiac magnetic field to greater than nanoteslas and allows the mapping of
these signals with intra-cardiac resolution. From the acquired magnetic images,
we also estimate the source electric current vector, flowing from the right
atria base via the Purkinje fibre bundle to the left ventricular apex. Our
results establish the solid-state quantum sensor's capability to probe cardiac
magnetic signals from mammalian animals and reveal their intra-cardiac
electrodynamics. This technique will enable the study of the origin and

spinor variables under the little group; the resulting vertices exhibit such
simplicity, that some simplifications should be hidden in the expressions
obtained from the extended scalar action. To investigate this, we study an
extended Einstein-Hilbert action that besides the minimal coupling, it also
includes terms of the form $\phi R^2$, $\phi R^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu}$ and $\phi

analytically derive the Pearson degree correlation coefficient and the
clustering coefficient of the proposed model. We select a few datasets of
real-world networks. By simulation, we show that the GCTC model matches very
well with the datasets in terms of Pearson degree correlations and clustering

our model, the datasets and other three prevalent benchmark models. We show
that the GCTC model performs equally well as the other three benchmark models.
Finally, we perform influence diffusion on the GCTC model using the independent
cascade model and the linear threshold model. We show that the influence
spreads of the GCTC model are much closer to those of the datasets than the

We derive that maximizing such mutual information can be relaxed to minimizing
the cross entropy between the applied topology transformation and its
estimation from node representations. In particular, we seek to sample a subset
of node pairs from the original graph and flip the edge connectivity between
each pair to transform the graph topology. Then, we self-train a representation
encoder to learn node representations by reconstructing the topology
transformations from the feature representations of the original and

downstream node classification, graph classification and link prediction tasks,
and results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art

gravity to obtain a generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. This
model has a new coupling constant $l_p$ implying two different modified TOV
equation forms characterized by the sign of $p'$. The negative branch reduces
to the ordinary GR-TOV in the limit of $l_p\to0$, while the positive one does
not. In the positive branch, Carballo-Rubio was able to find the exact
solutions using the constant-$\lambda$ trick. In this work, we investigate
whether this theory's negative branch can also provide a different feature of
the ultra-compact object compared to those obtained from the GR-TOV equation.
We study ultra-compact objects with an isotropically ideal fluid matter where
we use a simple but physically motivated equation of state $\rho=p/w+\rho_0$
with $w$=1 and $w$=1/3. In general, we obtain that the range of $l_p$ is very
restricted and must not be equal to $r_c$. Here $r_c$ is the starting point of
integration located at the center of the star. While $l_p$ should be set to be
much larger than Planck length $L_\text{Pl}$. Consequently, the mass-radius
curves for the various value of $l_p$ for both $w$ cases are still
indistinguishable from the standard GR-TOV results. Hence from the negative
branch of $p'(r)$, the additional free parameter $l_p$ does not provide a
significant effect compared to the standard GR-TOV equation results, even
though $l_p$ is not in the limit of $l_p\to0$ anymore. Therefore, similar to
the conclusion in Ref. [3] with GR theory that the ultra-compact objects from
negative branch of semi-classical gravity with a linear equation of state are
unable to generate demanding gravitational echoes.

moving speed of ground chargers and rough environments, especially in
large-scale scenarios or challenging scenarios such as separate islands. To
address the limitations, some researchers consider replacing ground mobile
chargers with lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support extremely
large-scale scenarios, because of the UAV moving at higher speed without
geographical limitation. Moreover, multiple automatic landing wireless charging
PADs are deployed in the network to recharge UAVs automatically. In this work,
we investigate the problem of introducing the minimal number of PADs in

clustering nodes in geographic locations. Then, we propose a center shift
combining algorithm to optimize this solution by shifting the location of PADs
and attempting to merge the adjacent PADs. The simulation results show that
compared to existing algorithms, our proposed scheme can use fewer PADs to

concentrate on another essential item for the D3-brane construction, i.e., the
existence of a Ricci-flat metric on $Y$, with particular attention to the case
$\Gamma=\mathbb{Z}_4$. We conjecture that on the exceptional divisor the
Kronheimer K\""ahler metric and the Ricci-flat one, that is locally flat at
infinity, coincide. The conjecture is shown to be true in the case of the
Ricci-flat metric on ${\rm tot} K_{{\mathbb WP}[112]}$ that we construct, which
is a partial resolution of $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_4$. For the full resolution
we have $Y=\operatorname{tot} K_{\mathbb{F}_{2}}$, where $\mathbb{F}_2$ is the
second Hizebruch surface. We try to extend the proof of the conjecture to this
case using the one-parameter K\""ahler metric on $\mathbb{F}_2$ produced by the
Kronheimer construction as initial datum in a Monge-Amp\`{e}re (MA) equation.
We exhibit three formulations of this MA equation, one in terms of the K\""ahler
potential, the other two in terms of the symplectic potential; in all cases one
can establish a series solution in powers of the fiber variable of the
canonical bundle. The main property of the MA equation is that it does not
impose any condition on the initial geometry of the exceptional divisor, but
uniquely determines all the subsequent terms as local functionals of the
initial datum. While a formal proof is still missing, numerical and analytical
results support the conjecture. As a by-product of our investigation we have
identified some new properties of this type of MA equations that we believe to

applications, such as self-driving. In this paper, we introduce the Stereo
Bird's Eye ViewNetwork (SBEVNet), a novel supervised end-to-end framework for
estimation of bird's eye view layout from a pair of stereo images. Although our
network reuses some of the building blocks from the state-of-the-art deep
learning networks for disparity estimation, we show that explicit depth
estimation is neither sufficient nor necessary. Instead, the learning of a good
internal bird's eye view feature representation is effective for layout
estimation. Specifically, we first generate a disparity feature volume using
the features of the stereo images and then project it to the bird's eye view
coordinates. This gives us coarse-grained information about the scene
structure. We also apply inverse perspective mapping (IPM) to map the input
images and their features to the bird's eye view. This gives us fine-grained
texture information. Concatenating IPM features with the projected feature
volume creates a rich bird's eye view representation which is useful for
spatial reasoning. We use this representation to estimate the BEV semantic map.
Additionally, we show that using the IPM features as a supervisory signal for
stereo features can give an improvement in performance. We demonstrate our
approach on two datasets:the KITTI dataset and a synthetically generated

has great ability to improve the overall classification accuracy. This method
is based on the divide and conquer principle, in which the problem space is

paper, we propose an ensemble learning method based on mixture of experts which
is named mixture of ELM based experts with trainable gating network (MEETG) to
improve the computing cost and to speed up the learning process of ME. The
structure of ME consists of multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) as base experts and
gating network, in which gradient-based learning algorithm is applied for
training the MLPs which is an iterative and time consuming process. In order to
overcome on these problems, we use the advantages of extreme learning machine
(ELM) for designing the structure of ME. ELM as a learning algorithm for single
hidden-layer feed forward neural networks provides much faster learning process
and better generalization ability in comparision with some other traditional
learning algorithms. Also, in the proposed method a trainable gating network is
applied to aggregate the outputs of the experts dynamically according to the

datasets confirm that MEETG has an acceptable performance in classification
problems. Furthermore, our experimental results show that the proposed approach
outperforms the original ELM on prediction stability and classification

been the source of many significant breakthroughs during the last two decades,
especially in the design of lower bounds or impossibility results for
deterministic algorithms. This paper aims at studying randomized synchronous
distributed computing through the lens of algebraic topology. We do so by
studying the wide class of (input-free) symmetry-breaking tasks, e.g., leader
election, in synchronous fault-free anonymous systems. We show that it is
possible to redefine solvability of a task ""locally"", i.e., for each simplex of
the protocol complex individually, without requiring any global consistency.
However, this approach has a drawback: it eliminates the topological aspect of
the computation, since a single facet has a trivial topological structure. To
overcome this issue, we introduce a ""projection"" $\pi$ of both protocol and
output complexes, where every simplex $\sigma$ is mapped to a complex
$\pi(\sigma)$; the later has a rich structure that replaces the structure we
lost by considering one single facet at a time.
  To show the significance and applicability of our topological approach, we
derive necessary and sufficient conditions for solving leader election in
synchronous fault-free anonymous shared-memory and message-passing models. In
both models, we consider scenarios in which there might be correlations between
the random values provided to the nodes. In particular, different parties might
have access to the same randomness source so their randomness is not
independent but equal. Interestingly, we find that solvability of leader
election relates to the number of parties that possess correlated randomness,
either directly or via their greatest common divisor, depending on the specific
communication model.

to assess the nature and extent of financial inclusion and its impact on the

on inclusive growth. This has been analyzed with the theoretical background on
financial access and economic growth, and by analyzing the primary data
collected from the Revenue Divisions of Karnataka. The results show that there
is a disparity in nature and extent of financial inclusion. Access to, availing

manipulate the optical properties of a nanomaterial for target applications. We
have recently shown that surprisingly feeble external stimuli are able to
transform uniaxial nematic liquid crystals (LCs) of cuboidal particles into
biaxial nematic LCs. In the light of these results, here we apply an external
field that forces the reorientation of colloidal cuboids in nematic LCs and
sparks a uniaxial-to-biaxial texture switching. By Dynamic Monte Carlo
simulation, we investigate the unsteady-state reorientation dynamics at the
particle scale when the field is applied (uniaxial-to-biaxial switching) and
then removed (biaxial-to-uniaxial switching). We detect a strong correlation
between the response time, being the time taken for the system to reorient, and
particle anisotropy, which spans from rod-like to plate-like geometries.
Interestingly, self-dual shaped cuboids, theoretically considered as the most

upcoming Fifth Generation (5G) and future beyond-5G mobile communication
systems. It adds computational power towards the edge of cellular networks,
much closer to energy-constrained user devices, and therewith allows the users
to offload tasks to the edge computing nodes for low-latency applications with
very-limited battery consumption. However, due to the high dynamics of user
demand and server load, task congestion may occur at the edge nodes resulting
in long queuing delay. Such delays can significantly degrade the quality of
experience (QoE) of some latency-sensitive applications, raise the risk of
service outage, and cannot be efficiently resolved by conventional queue
management solutions.
  In this article, we study a latency-outage critical scenario, where users
intend to limit the risk of latency outage. We propose an impatience-based
queuing strategy for such users to intelligently choose between MEC offloading
and local computation, allowing them to rationally renege from the task queue.
The proposed approach is demonstrated by numerical simulations to be efficient
for generic service model, when a perfect queue status information is
available. For the practical case where the users obtain only imperfect queue
status information, we design an optimal online learning strategy to enable its
application in Poisson service scenarios.

the success of today's scientific projects with vast volumes of data produced

significantly reduce data size, but it also can control the compression errors
based on user-specified error bounds. Autoencoder (AE) models have been widely
used in image compression, but few AE-based compression approaches support
error-bounding features, which are highly required by scientific applications.
To address this issue, we explore using convolutional autoencoders to improve
error-bounded lossy compression for scientific data, with the following three
key contributions. (1) We provide an in-depth investigation of the
characteristics of various autoencoder models and develop an error-bounded
autoencoder-based framework in terms of the SZ model. (2) We optimize the
compression quality for main stages in our designed AE-based error-bounded
compression framework, fine-tuning the block sizes and latent sizes and also
optimizing the compression efficiency of latent vectors. (3) We evaluate our
proposed solution using five real-world scientific datasets and comparing them
with six other related works. Experiments show that our solution exhibits a
very competitive compression quality from among all the compressors in our
tests. In absolute terms, it can obtain a much better compression quality (100%
~ 800% improvement in compression ratio with the same data distortion) compared
with SZ2.1 and ZFP in cases with a high compression ratio.

HOIs (e.g., sitting on a chair) from static images is feasible, it is unlikely
even for humans to guess temporal-related HOIs (e.g., opening/closing a door)

However, conventional HOI methods operating on only static images have been
used to predict temporal-related interactions, which is essentially guessing
without temporal contexts and may lead to sub-optimal performance. In this
paper, we bridge this gap by detecting video-based HOIs with explicit temporal
information. We first show that a naive temporal-aware variant of a common
action detection baseline does not work on video-based HOIs due to a
feature-inconsistency issue. We then propose a simple yet effective
architecture named Spatial-Temporal HOI Detection (ST-HOI) utilizing temporal

HOI benchmark dubbed VidHOI where our proposed approach serves as a solid
baseline.

flocculation phase characterized by a growing average floc size, followed by a
statistically steady equilibrium phase. We analyze the temporal evolution of
floc size and shape due to aggregation, breakage, and deformation. Larger
turbulent shear and weaker cohesive forces yield elongated flocs that are
smaller in size. Flocculation proceeds most rapidly when the fluid and particle
time scales are balanced and a suitably defined Stokes number is \textit{O}(1).
During the transient stage, cohesive forces of intermediate strength produce
flocs of the largest size, as they are strong enough to cause aggregation, but
not so strong as to pull the floc into a compact shape. Small Stokes numbers
and weak turbulence delay the onset of the equilibrium stage. During
equilibrium, stronger cohesive forces yield flocs of larger size. The
equilibrium floc size distribution exhibits a preferred size that depends on
the cohesive number. We observe that flocs are generally elongated by turbulent
stresses before breakage. Flocs of size close to the Kolmogorov length scale
preferentially align themselves with the intermediate strain direction and the
vorticity vector. Flocs of smaller size tend to align themselves with the
extensional strain direction. More generally, flocs are aligned with the
strongest Lagrangian stretching direction. The Kolmogorov scale is seen to
limit floc growth. We propose a new flocculation model with a variable fractal
dimension that predicts the temporal evolution of the floc size and shape.

volume and around objects. The flow is guaranteed to converge and to stop at a
single fixed point. We show that the obstacle avoidance problem can be inverted
to enforce that the flow remains enclosed within a volume defined by a
polygonal surface. We formally guarantee that such a flow will never contact
the boundaries of the enclosing volume and obstacles, and will asymptotically
converge towards an attractor. We further create smooth motion fields around
obstacles with edges (e.g. tables). Both obstacles and enclosures may be
time-varying, i.e. moving, expanding and shrinking. The technique enables a
robot to navigate within an enclosed corridor while avoiding static and moving
obstacles. It was applied on an autonomous robot (QOLO) in a static complex
indoor environment, and also tested in simulations with dense crowds. The final
proof of concept was performed in an outdoor environment in Lausanne. The
QOLO-robot successfully traversed a marketplace in the center of town in
presence of a diverse crowd with a non-uniform motion pattern.

they do not align precisely with the object segmentations. Instead, we produce

the network can exploit knowledge regarding the required lesion volume. In
addition, we propose an attention neural network module to refine dRAMs,
optimized together with the main regression task. We evaluated our algorithm on
90 subjects. Results show our method achieved 70.2% Dice coefficient,
substantially outperforming the CAM-based baseline at 48.6%.

many-electron systems, which relies on the recently introduced single boson
exchange (SBE) representation of the parquet equations [Phys. Rev. B 100,
155149 (2019)]. The latter exploits a diagrammatic decomposition, which
classifies the contributions to the full scattering amplitude in terms of their
reducibility with respect to cutting one interaction line, naturally
distinguishing the processes mediated by the exchange of a single boson in the
different channels. We apply this idea to the fRG by splitting the one-loop fRG
flow equations for the vertex function into SBE contributions and a residual
four-point fermionic vertex. Similarly as in the case of parquet solvers,
recasting the fRG algorithm in the SBE representation offers both computational
and interpretative advantages: the SBE decomposition not only significantly
reduces the numerical effort of treating the high-frequency asymptotics of the
flowing vertices, but it also allows for a clear physical identification of the
collective degrees of freedom at play. We illustrate the advantages of an SBE
formulation of fRG-based schemes, by computing through the merger of dynamical
mean-field theory and fRG the susceptibilities and the Yukawa couplings of the
two-dimensional Hubbard model from weak to strong coupling, for which we also
present an intuitive physical explanation of the results. The SBE formulation
of the one-loop flow equations paves a promising route for future multiboson
and multiloop extensions of fRG-based algorithms.

relationship between the carbon emission and income level. After performing the
related data analysis for each country, we concluded whether the results for
that country were in line with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)
hypothesis. The EKC hypothesis suggests that the carbon emission per capita
starts a declining trend when the country-specific high level of income is
reached. The results of our data analyses show that the EKC hypothesis is valid
for high-income countries and the declining trends of carbon emission are
clearly observed when the income level reaches a specific high enough level. On
the other hand, for the non-high income countries, our analysis results show
that it is too early to make an assessment at this growth stage of their
economies because they have not reached their related high-enough income per
capita levels yet. Furthermore, we performed two more additional analyses on
high-income countries. First, we analyzed the related starting years of their

satisfaction problems. An explanation here is a sequence of simple inference
steps, where the simplicity of an inference step is measured by the number and
types of constraints and facts used, and where the sequence explains all
logical consequences of the problem. We build on these formal foundations and
tackle two emerging questions, namely how to generate explanations that are
provably optimal (with respect to the given cost metric) and how to generate
them efficiently. To answer these questions, we develop 1) an implicit hitting
set algorithm for finding optimal unsatisfiable subsets; 2) a method to reduce
multiple calls for (optimal) unsatisfiable subsets to a single call that takes
constraints on the subset into account, and 3) a method for re-using relevant
information over multiple calls to these algorithms. The method is also
applicable to other problems that require finding cost-optimal unsatiable
subsets. We specifically show that this approach can be used to effectively
find sequences of optimal explanation steps for constraint satisfaction
problems like logic grid puzzles.

variational quantum algorithms for optimisation problems. Crucial for the
performance of these algorithms is to ensure that the algorithm converges with
high probability to a near-optimal solution in a small time. In Barkoutsos et
al (Quantum 2020) an alternative class of objective functions, called
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), was introduced and it was shown that they
perform better than standard objective functions. Here we extend that work by
introducing an evolving objective function, which we call Ascending-CVaR and
that can be used for any optimisation problem. We test our proposed objective
function, in an emulation environment, using as case-studies three different
optimisation problems: Max-Cut, Number Partitioning and Portfolio Optimisation.
We examine multiple instances of different sizes and analyse the performance
using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with hardware-efficient ansatz
and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We show that
Ascending-CVaR in all cases performs better than standard objective functions
or the ""constant"" CVaR of Barkoutsos et al (Quantum 2020) and that it can be
used as a heuristic for avoiding sub-optimal minima. Our proposal achieves
higher overlap with the ideal state in all problems, whether we consider easy
or hard instances -- on average it gives up to ten times greater overlap at
Portfolio Optimisation and Number Partitioning, while it gives an 80%
improvement at Max-Cut. In the hard instances we consider, for the number
partitioning problem, standard objective functions fail to find the correct
solution in almost all cases, CVaR finds the correct solution at 60% of the
cases, while Ascending-CVaR finds the correct solution in 95% of the cases.

independently to preserve the diversity property of graph embedding methods.
Meanwhile, we choose heterogeneous graphs to construct the graph consensus term
to explore the correlations among multiple views jointly. To this end, the
diversity and complementary information among different views could be
simultaneously considered. Furthermore, the proposed framework is utilized to
implement the multi-view extension of Locality Linear Embedding, named
Multi-view Locality Linear Embedding (MvLLE), which could be efficiently solved
by applying the alternating optimization strategy. Empirical validations
conducted on six benchmark datasets can show the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

specified as triples consisting of a state in the reference model, an input,
and the expected reaction of the system under test defined by a set of
admissible outputs, allowing for different implementation variants. Composite
requirements are specified as collections of elementary ones. Two
requirements-driven test generation strategies are introduced, and their fault
coverage guarantees are proven. The first is exhaustive in the sense that it
produces test suites guaranteeing requirements satisfaction if the test suite
is passed. If the test suite execution fails for a given implementation,
however, this does not imply that the requirement has been violated. Instead,
the failure may indicate an arbitrary violation of I/O-equivalence, which could
be unrelated to the requirement under test. The second strategy is complete in
the sense that it produces test suites guaranteeing requirements satisfaction
if and only if the suite is passed. Complexity considerations indicate that for
practical application, the first strategy should be preferred to the second.
Typical application scenarios for this approach are safety-critical systems,
where safety requirements should be tested with maximal thoroughness, while
user requirements might be checked with lesser effort, using conventional
testing heuristics.

Smart communication technologies provide accurate traffic data for choosing one

collective traffic dynamics which result from route choice relying on outdated
traffic information. We find for sufficiently small information delays that
traffic flows are stable against perturbations. However, delays beyond a
bifurcation point induce self-organized flow oscillations of increasing
amplitude -- congestion arises. Providing delayed information averaged over
sufficiently long periods of time or, more intriguingly, reducing the number of
vehicles adhering to the route recommendations may prevent such delay-induced
congestion. We reveal the fundamental mechanisms underlying these phenomena in
a minimal two-road model and demonstrate their generality in microscopic,
agent-based simulations of a road network system. Our findings provide a way to
conceptually understand system-wide traffic dynamics caused by broadly used
non-instantaneous routing information and suggest how resulting unintended
collective traffic states could be avoided.

as S=1/2 pseudospin units, each two-leg spin ladder behaves as a chain of S=1/2

weakly, so it is required that all nearest-neighbor spin exchange paths of

ladder arrangements of a kagome layer. This constraint imposes three sets of
entropy spectra with which each kagome layer can exchange energy with the
surrounding on lowering the temperature below ~1.5 K and on raising the
external magnetic field B. We discovered that the specific heat anomalies of

magnetic field B to ~4.2 T, that a new specific heat anomaly occurs when B is
increased above ~5.5 T, and that the imposed three sets of entropy spectra are
responsible for the field-dependence of the specific heat anomalies.

detector. For a grazing angle beam, however, the thin planar detector achieves
a better time resolution because it has a lower pixel capacitance, and
therefore suffers less from jitter in the analog front-end for the low charge
signals that mainly occur in this type of measurement. Finally, it is also
shown that the 3D and thin planar detector can achieve time resolutions for
large clusters of about 100ps and 250ps, respectively, by combining many single
hit measurements.

novel concepts with just a handful of labelled data. To classify query

support set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume
that those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support
set. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject
to change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work
addresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under
Support/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled
from related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following.
First, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines

that well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable
drop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study.
Finally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect
of DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal

Adaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT
with the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments

challenging, owing to the large dimension of the hidden state process. Whilst
in principle the hidden state process can be marginalized out via forward
filtering, in practice the computational cost of doing so increases
exponentially with the number of coupled Markov chains, making this approach
infeasible in most applications. Monte Carlo methods can be utilized, but
despite many remarkable developments in model selection methodology, generic
approaches continue to be ill-suited for such high-dimensional problems. Here
we develop specialized solutions for CHMMs with weak inter-chain dependencies.
Specifically we construct effective proposal distributions for the hidden state
process that remain computationally viable as the number of chains increases,
and that require little user input or tuning. This methodology is particularly
applicable to individual-level infectious disease models characterized as
CHMMs, in which each chain represents an individual, and the coupling
represents contact between individuals. Since the only significant contacts are
between susceptible and infectious individuals, and since multiple infection
pathways are often possible, the resulting CHMMs naturally have low inter-chain
dependencies. We demonstrate the utility of our methodology with an application

sample of previously reported bursts of FRB 121102 detected with the MeerKAT
telescope in September 2019. The wide contiguous bandwidth of these
observations have revealed a complex bifurcating structure in some bursts at
$1250$ MHz. When de-dispersed to their structure-optimised dispersion measures,
two of the bursts show a clear deviation from the cold plasma dispersion
relationship below $1250$ MHz. We find a differential dispersion measure of
${\sim}1{-}2$ pc cm$^{-3}$ between the lower and higher frequency regions of
each burst. We investigate the possibility of plasma lensing by Gaussian lenses
of ${\sim}10$ AU in the host galaxy, and demonstrate that they can
qualitatively produce some of the observed burst morphologies. Other possible
causes for the observed frequency dependence, such as Faraday delay, are also
discussed. Unresolved sub-components in the bursts, however, may have led to an
incorrect DM determination. We hence advise exercising caution when considering
bursts in isolation. We analyse the presence of two apparent burst pairs. One
of these pairs is a potential example of upward frequency drift. The
possibility that burst pairs are echoes is also discussed. The average
structure-optimised dispersion measure is found to be $563.5\pm 0.2
(\text{sys}) \pm 0.8 (\text{stat})$ pc cm$^{-3}$ $-$ consistent with the values
reported in 2018. We use two independent methods to determine the
structure-optimised dispersion measure of the bursts: the DM_phase algorithm
and autocorrelation functions. The latter $-$ originally developed for pulsar
analysis $-$ is applied to FRBs for the first time in this paper.

superconductor. In contrast to conventional spin-singlet superconductivity,
spin-triplet superconductivity possesses spin and angular momentum degrees of
freedom. To detect these degrees of freedom and obtain the solid evidence of
spin-triplet superconductivity in UTe$_2$, we performed $^{125}$Te-NMR
measurement. We previously reported that the shoulder signal appears in NMR
spectra below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in $H
\parallel b$, and that a slight decrease in the Knight shift along the $b$ and
$c$ axes ($K_b$ and $K_c$, respectively) below $T_{\rm c}$ at a low magnetic
field $H$. To clarify the origin of the shoulder signal and the trace of the
decrease in $K_b$, we compared the $^{125}$Te-NMR spectra obtained when
$H~\parallel~b$ and $H~\parallel~c$ and measured the $^{125}$Te-NMR spectra for
$H~\parallel~b$ up to 14.5~T. The intensity of the shoulder signal observed for
$H~\parallel~b$ has a maximum at $\sim 6$~T and vanishes above 10~T, although
the superconductivity is confirmed by the $\chi_{\rm AC}$ measurements, which
can survive up to 14.5~T (maximum $H$ in the present measurement). Moreover,
the decrease in $K_b$ in the SC state starts to be small around 7~T and almost
zero at 12.5~T. This indicates that the SC spin state gradually changes with
the application of $H$. Meanwhile, in $H~\parallel~c$, unexpected broadening
without the shoulder signals was observed below $T_{\rm c}$ at 1~T, and this
broadening was quickly suppressed with increasing $H$. We construct the
$H$--$T$ phase diagram for $H~\parallel~b$ and $H~\parallel~c$ based on the NMR
measurements and discuss possible SC states with the theoretical consideration.
We suggest that the inhomogeneous SC state characterized by the broadening of
the NMR spectrum originates from the spin degrees of freedom.

This drawback can be overcome by using mixed solutions, where the ionic

soluble at lower temperatures. The solubility and electrolytic conductivity for
a binary surfactant mixture of anionic methyl ester sulfonates (MES) with
nonionic alkyl polyglucoside and alkyl polyoxyethylene ether at 5 deg C during
long-term storage were measured. Phase diagrams were established; a general
theoretical model for their explanation was developed and checked
experimentally. The binary and ternary phase diagrams for studied surfactant
mixtures include phase domains: mixed micelles; micelles and crystallites;
crystallites, and molecular solution. The proposed general methodology, which
utilizes the equations of molecular thermodynamics at minimum number of
experimental measurements, is convenient for construction of such phase
diagrams. The results could increase the range of applicability of
MES-surfactants with relatively high Krafft temperature, but with various
useful properties such as excellent biodegradability and skin compatibility;
stability in hard water; good wetting and cleaning performance.

publication of datasets. We illustrate how the identification of datasets that
shared in researchers' ORCID profiles enables the study of the characteristics

study data sharing practices we obtained all ORCID profiles reporting at least
one dataset in their ""works"" list, together with information related to the
individual researchers producing the datasets. The retrieved data was organized
and analyzed in a SQL database hosted at CWTS. Our results indicate that
DataCite is by far the most important data source for providing information
about datasets recorded in ORCID. There is also a substantial overlap between
DataCite records with other repositories (Figshare, Dryad, and Zenodo). The
analysis of the distribution of researchers producing datasets shows that the
top six countries with more data producers, also have a relatively higher
percentage of people who have produced datasets out of total researchers with
datasets than researchers in the total ORCID. By disciplines, researchers that
belong to the areas of Natural Sciences and Medicine and Life Sciences are
those with the largest amount of reported datasets. Finally, we observed that
researchers who have started their PhD around 2015 published their first
dataset earlier that those researchers that started their PhD before. The work
concludes with some reflections of the possibilities of ORCID as a relevant

we design Tusk, a zero-message overhead asynchronous consensus protocol, to

through interplanetary space is essential. EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting
Information Asset (EUHFORIA) is a data-driven, physics-based model, tracing the
evolution of CMEs through background solar wind conditions. It employs a
spheromak flux rope, which provides it with the advantage of reconstructing the
internal magnetic field configuration of CMEs. This is something that is not
included in the simpler cone CME model used so far for space weather
forecasting. This work aims at assessing the spheromak CME model included in
EUHFORIA. We employed the spheromak CME model to reconstruct a well observed
CME and compare model output to in situ observations. We focus on an eruption
from 6 January 2013 encountered by two radially aligned spacecraft, Venus
Express and STEREO-A. We first analysed the observed properties of the source
of this CME eruption and we extracted the CME properties as it lifted off from
the Sun. Using this information, we set up EUHFORIA runs to model the event.
The model predicts arrival times from half to a full day ahead of the in situ
observed ones, but within errors established from similar studies. In the
modelling domain, the CME appears to be propagating primarily southward, which
is in accordance with white-light images of the CME eruption close to the Sun.
In order to get the observed magnetic field topology, we aimed at selecting a
spheromak rotation angle for which the axis of symmetry of the spheromak is
perpendicular to the direction of the polarity inversion line (PIL). The
modelled magnetic field profiles, their amplitude, arrival times, and sheath
region length are all affected by the choice of radius of the modelled
spheromak.

$D$. We are interested in the stationary bound state formed by the two RTP's in
the presence of a mutual attractive interaction. The distribution of the
relative coordinate $y$ indeed reaches a steady state that we characterize in
terms of the solution of a second-order differential equation. We obtain the
explicit formula for the stationary probability $P(y)$ of $y$ for two examples
of interaction potential $V(y)$. The first one corresponds to $V(y) \sim |y|$.
In this case, for $D=0$ we find that $P(y)$ contains a delta function part at

component. For $D>0$, the delta function part broadens, leading instead to weak
clustering. The second example is the harmonic attraction $V(y) \sim y^2$ in

labor market and residential attachment. To overcome the usually severe
selection issues, we exploit a unique migration lottery that randomly assigns
access to otherwise restricted residence permits in Liechtenstein (situated
between Austria and Switzerland). Using an instrumental variable approach, our
results show that lottery compliers (whose migration behavior complies with the
assignment in their first lottery) raise their employment probability in
Liechtenstein by on average 24 percentage points across outcome periods (2008
to 2018) as a result of receiving a permit. Relatedly, their activity level and
employment duration in Liechtenstein increase by on average 20 percentage
points and 1.15 years, respectively, over the outcome window. These substantial
and statistically significant effects are mainly driven by individuals not
(yet) working in Liechtenstein prior to the lottery rather than by previous
cross-border commuters. Moreover, we find both the labor market and residential
effects to be persistent even several years after the lottery with no sign of
fading out. These results suggest that granting resident permits to foreign
workers can be effective to foster labor supply even beyond the effect of
cross-border commuting from adjacent regions.

However, the detection of such infrastructures is complex as they have highly
variable shapes and sizes, i.e., some infrastructures, such as electrical
substations, are too small while others, such as airports, are too large.
Besides, airports can have a surface area either small or too large with
completely different shapes, which makes its correct detection challenging. As

This paper presents (1) a smart Critical Infrastructure dataset, named
CI-dataset, organised into two scales, small and large scales critical

$L-$Lipschitz continuous gradients; i.e. they require $O(m/\epsilon^2)$

$O(1/\epsilon^2)$ with a method that requires only a constant number of

that the general shape of the shadow for non-rotating AOS black hole is
circular in shape as is expected for its classical counter part too, but the
presence of loop quantum gravity inspired modification contracts the shadow
radius and the effect reduces with the increase in the mass of the black hole.
On a similar note, in the rotating situation, we find contraction in shadow
radius due to quantum effects and the tapered nature of the shadow as expected
from the classical Kerr case. However, instead of the symmetrical contraction,
like non-rotating one, we found more contraction on one side relative to the

finally studied super-radiance in rotating AOS background and observed that the

vision (CV). However, training and inference of DNN models are both memory and
computation intensive, incurring significant overhead in terms of energy
consumption and silicon area. In particular, inference is much more
cost-sensitive than training because training can be done offline with powerful
platforms, while inference may have to be done on battery powered devices with
constrained form factors, especially for mobile or edge vision applications. In
order to accelerate DNN inference, model quantization was proposed. However
previous works only focus on the quantization rate without considering the
efficiency of operations. In this paper, we propose Dendrite-Tree based Neural
Network (DTNN) for energy-efficient inference with table lookup operations
enabled by activation quantization. In DTNN both costly weight access and
arithmetic computations are eliminated for inference. We conducted experiments
on various kinds of DNN models such as LeNet-5, MobileNet, VGG, and ResNet with
different datasets, including MNIST, Cifar10/Cifar100, SVHN, and ImageNet. DTNN
achieved significant energy saving (19.4X and 64.9X improvement on ResNet-18

further validate the effectiveness of DTNN and compare with state-of-the-art

materials with unconventional and potentially useful properties. Recent years
have seen much success in creating artificial hybrid structures exhibiting main
characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) topological superconductors. Yet, bulk
materials known to combine inherent superconductivity with nontrivial topology
remain scarce, largely because distinguishing their central characteristic --
topological surface states -- proved challenging due to a dominant contribution
from the superconducting bulk. Reported here is a highly anomalous behaviour of
surface superconductivity in topologically nontrivial 3D superconductor In2Bi
where the surface states result from its nontrivial band structure, which
itself is a consequence of the non-symmorphic crystal symmetry and strong
spin-orbit coupling. In contrast to smoothly decreasing diamagnetic
susceptibility above the bulk critical field Hc2, associated with surface
superconductivity in conventional superconductors, we observe near-perfect,
Meissner-like screening of low-frequency magnetic fields well above Hc2. The
enhanced diamagnetism disappears at a new phase transition close to the
critical field of surface superconductivity Hc3. Using theoretical modelling,
we show that the anomalous screening is consistent with modification of surface
superconductivity due to the presence of topological surface states. The
demonstrated possibility to detect signatures of the surface states using
macroscopic magnetization measurements provides an important new tool for
discovery and identification of topological superconductors.

high-resolution (HR) images are required to detect small plants present at
early stages. This study explores the impact of image ground sampling distance
(GSD) on the performances of maize plant detection at 3-5 leaves stage using
Faster-RCNN. Data collected at HR (GSD=0.3cm) over 6 contrasted sites were used
for model training. Two additional sites with images acquired both at high and
low (GSD=0.6cm) resolution were used for model evaluation. Results show that
Faster-RCNN achieved very good plant detection and counting (rRMSE=0.08)
performances when native HR images are used both for training and validation.
Similarly, good performances were observed (rRMSE=0.11) when the model is
trained over synthetic low-resolution (LR) images obtained by down-sampling the
native training HR images, and applied to the synthetic LR validation images.
Conversely, poor performances are obtained when the model is trained on a given
spatial resolution and applied to another spatial resolution. Training on a mix
of HR and LR images allows to get very good performances on the native HR
(rRMSE=0.06) and synthetic LR (rRMSE=0.10) images. However, very low
performances are still observed over the native LR images (rRMSE=0.48), mainly
due to the poor quality of the native LR images. Finally, an advanced
super-resolution method based on GAN (generative adversarial network) that
introduces additional textural information derived from the native HR images

scattering processes in QED. The reduced density matrix for the hard particles,
obtained via tracing over the entire spectrum of soft photons, is shown to have
a large eigenvalue, which governs the behavior of the Renyi entropies and of
the non-analytic part of the entanglement entropy at low orders in perturbation
theory. The leading perturbative entanglement entropy is logarithmically IR
divergent. The coefficient of the IR divergence exhibits certain universality
properties, irrespectively of the dressing of the asymptotic charged particles
and the detailed properties of the initial state. In a certain kinematical
limit, the coefficient is proportional to the cusp anomalous dimension in QED.
For Fock basis computations associated with two-electron scattering, we derive
an exact expression for the large eigenvalue of the density matrix in terms of
hard scattering amplitudes, which is valid at any finite order in perturbation
theory. As a result, the IR logarithmic divergences appearing in the
expressions for the Renyi and entanglement entropies persist at any finite
order of the perturbative expansion. To all orders, however, the IR logarithmic
divergences exponentiate, rendering the large eigenvalue of the density matrix
IR finite. The all-orders Renyi entropies (per unit time, per particle flux),
which are shown to be proportional to the total inclusive cross-section in the
initial state, are also free of IR divergences. The entanglement entropy, on
the other hand, retains non-analytic, logarithmic behavior with respect to the
size of the box (which provides the IR cutoff) even to all orders in
perturbation theory.

We find an overall availability of quality controlled wind lidar data of 97 %

1 mm/h or fog or low clouds below 100 m. The mean bias in the horizontal wind
speed is within 0.1 m/s with a high correlation between the mast and wind lidar

fog or low clouds) larger deviations are observed. The mean bias in the wind

uncertainty in the alignment of the wind lidars and the mast wind vanes. The
well-known 180 degree error in the wind direction output for this type of

an auxiliary wind vane at a height of 10 m is applied, leading to a reduction
of the 180 degree error below 2 %. This scheme can be applied in real-time

networks (WSNs) for smart city applications in several ways. Among them, a UAV
can be employed as a relay in a ""store-carry and forward"" fashion by uploading
data from ground sensors and metering devices and, then, downloading it to a
central unit. However, both the uploading and downloading phases can be prone
to potential threats and attacks. As a legacy from traditional wireless
networks, the jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to
UAV-aided communications, especially when also the jammer is mobile, e.g., it
is mounted on a UAV or inside a terrestrial vehicle. In this paper, we
investigate anti-jamming communications for UAV-aided WSNs operating over
doubly-selective channels in the downloading phase. In such a scenario, the
signals transmitted by the UAV and the malicious mobile jammer undergo both
time dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion
caused by their mobility. To suppress high-power jamming signals, we propose a
blind physical-layer technique that jointly detects the UAV and jammer symbols
through serial disturbance cancellation based on symbol-level post-sorting of
the detector output. Amplitudes, phases, time delays, and Doppler shifts -
required to implement the proposed detection strategy - are blindly estimated
from data through the use of algorithms that exploit the
almost-cyclostationarity properties of the received signal and the detailed
structure of multicarrier modulation format. Simulation results corroborate the
anti-jamming capabilities of the proposed method, for different mobility
scenarios of the jammer.

Target-driven discovery of perovskite solid solutions has been a great
challenge due to the analytical complexity introduced by disorder. Here, we
demonstrate that an unsupervised deep learning strategy can find fingerprints
of disordered materials that embed perovskite formability and underlying
crystal structure information by learning only from the chemical composition,
manifested in (A1-xA'x)BO3 and A(B1-xB'x)O3 formulae. This phenomenon can be
capitalized to predict the crystal symmetry of experimental compositions,
outperforming several supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. The educated
nature of material fingerprints has led to the conception of analogical
materials discovery that facilitates inverse exploration of promising
perovskites based on similarity investigation with known materials. The search
space of unstudied perovskites is screened from ~600,000 feasible compounds
using experimental data powered ML models and automated web mining tools at a
94% success rate. This concept further provides insights on possible phase
transitions and computational modelling of complex compositions. The proposed
quantitative analysis of materials analogies is expected to bridge the gap
between the existing materials literature and the undiscovered terrain.

The negative result measurements (NRM) are implemented in order to validate the
presumption of non-invasive measurability used in defining macrorealism. Among
all the experiments to date testing macrorealism, the present experiment stands
out in comprehensively addressing the relevant loopholes. The clumsiness
loophole is addressed through precision testing of any classical invasiveness
involved in the implementation of NRMs. This is done by suitably choosing the
experimental parameters so that the quantum mechanically (QM) predicted
validity of all the relevant two-time no-signalling in time (NSIT) conditions
is maintained in all the three pairwise experiments performed to show LGI/WLGI
violation. Further, importantly, the detection efficiency loophole is addressed
by adopting suitable modifications in the measurement strategy enabling the
demonstration of the violation of LGI/WLGI for any non-zero detection
efficiency. We also show how other relevant loopholes like the multiphoton
emission loophole, coincidence loophole, and the preparation state loophole are
all closed in the present experiment. We report the LGI violation of $1.32 \pm
0.04$ and the WLGI violation of $0.10 \pm 0.02$, where the magnitudes of
violation are respectively 8 times and 5 times the corresponding error values,
while agreeing perfectly with the ranges of the QM predicted values of the LGI,
WLGI expressions that we estimate by taking into account the non-idealities of
the actual experiment. Simultaneously, the experimentally observed
probabilities satisfy all the two-time NSIT conditions up to the order of
$10^{-2}$, which ensures non-invasiveness in the implemented NRMs.

between solute Mn and Fe matrix, and a change in bonding strength between Mn

A parallel quantum
algorithm is proposed for simulating the dynamics of a large class of
Hamiltonians with good sparse structures, called uniform-structured
Hamiltonians, including various Hamiltonians of practical interest like local
Hamiltonians and Pauli sums. Given the oracle access to the target sparse
Hamiltonian, in both query and gate complexity, the running time of our
parallel quantum simulation algorithm measured by the quantum circuit depth has
a doubly (poly-)logarithmic dependence $\operatorname{polylog}\log(1/\epsilon)$
on the simulation precision $\epsilon$. This presents an exponential
improvement over the dependence $\operatorname{polylog}(1/\epsilon)$ of
previous optimal sparse Hamiltonian simulation algorithm without parallelism.
To obtain this result, we introduce a novel notion of parallel quantum walk,
based on Childs' quantum walk. The target evolution unitary is approximated by
a truncated Taylor series, which is obtained by combining these quantum walks
in a parallel way. A lower bound $\Omega(\log \log (1/\epsilon))$ is
established, showing that the $\epsilon$-dependence of the gate depth achieved
in this work cannot be significantly improved.
  Our algorithm is applied to simulating three physical models: the Heisenberg
model, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and a quantum chemistry model in second
quantization. By explicitly calculating the gate complexity for implementing
the oracles, we show that on all these models, the total gate depth of our
algorithm has a $\operatorname{polylog}\log(1/\epsilon)$ dependence in the
parallel setting.

show whether clients are over-risked or under-risked, changes in KYC risk lead

small hetero- and homo-nuclear molecules employing circularly polarized light
and address molecular-frame photoelectron angular distributions in the light's
polarization plane (CP-MFPADs). We find that the main forward-scattering peaks
of CP-MFPADs are slightly tilted with respect to the molecular axis. We show
that this tilt angle can be directly connected to the molecular bond length by
a simple, universal formula. The extraction of the bond length becomes more
accurate as the photoelectron energy is increased. We apply the derived formula
to several examples of CP-MFPADs of C 1s and O 1s photoelectrons of CO, which
have been measured experimentally or obtained by means of ab initio modeling.
The photoelectron kinetic energies range from 70 to 1000~eV and the extracted
bond lengths agree well with the known bond length of the CO molecule in its
ground state. In addition, we discuss the influence of the back-scattering
contribution that is superimposed over the analyzed forward-scattering peak in
case of homo-nuclear diatomic molecules as N$_2$.

parameter-dependent and random convection-diffusion problems. It is inspired by
the multi-modes method of [7,8] and the ensemble method of [20] and extends
those methods into a more general and unified framework. The main idea of the
framework is to reformulate the underlying problem into another problem with
parameter-independent convection and diffusion coefficients and a
parameter-dependent (and solution-dependent) right-hand side, a fixed-point
iteration is then employed to compute the solution of the reformulated problem.
The main benefit of the proposed approach is that an efficient direct solver
and a block Krylov subspace iterative solver can be used at each iteration,
allowing to reuse the $LU$ matrix factorization or to do an efficient
matrix-matrix multiplication for all parameters, which in turn results in
significant computation saving. Convergence and rates of convergence are
established for the iterative method both at the variational continuous level
and at the finite element discrete level under some structure conditions.
Several strategies for establishing reformulations of parameter-dependent and
random diffusion and convection-diffusion problems are proposed and their
computational complexity is analyzed. Several 1-D and 2-D numerical experiments
are also provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed iterative
method and to validate the theoretical convergence results.

units (taxels) into a flexible surface material and uses signal processing to
achieve sensing with super-resolution accuracy. We propose a theory for
geometric super-resolution to guide the development of haptic sensors of this

prevalent throughout the corona. The associated energy estimates suggest the
waves carry enough energy to meet the demands of the coronal radiative losses

appear to be weakly damped, which would imply low rates of energy transfer from
the large-scale transverse motions to smaller-scales via either uni-turbulence
or resonant absorption. This raises questions about how the observed kink modes
would deposit their energy into the coronal plasma. Moreover, these
observations, combined with the results of Monte Carlo simulations, lead us to
infer that the solar corona displays a spectrum of density ratios, with a
smaller density ratio (relative to the ambient corona) in quiescent coronal

the statistics of rare events in which all three species go extinct due to
strong but rare fluctuations. These fluctuations are from the tails of the
probability distribution of species concentrations. They render a coexistence
of three populations unstable even if the coexistence is stable in the
deterministic limit. We determine the mean time to extinction (MTE) by using a
WKB-ansatz in the master equation that represents the stochastic description of
this model. This way, the calculation is reduced to a problem of classical
mechanics and amounts to solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with zero-energy
Hamiltonian. We solve the corresponding Hamilton's equations of motion in
six-dimensional phase space numerically by using the Iterative Action
Minimization Method. This allows to project on the optimal path to extinction,
starting from a parameter choice where the three-species coexistence-fixed
point undergoes a Hopf bifurcation and becomes stable. Specifically for our
system of three species, extinction events can be triggered along various paths
to extinction, differing in their intermediate steps. We compare our analytical
predictions with results from Gillespie simulations for two-species
extinctions, complemented by an analytical calculation of the MTE in which the
remaining third species goes extinct. From Gillespie simulations we also

For the etched films, the electron mobility at 200 K decreased with decreasing

electron effective mass near the metal-insulator transition. A slight upturn in
the resistivity and a positive magnetoresistance at low temperatures were
typically observed for the etched films down to 3 ML, which was explained by
weak anti-localization of electrons in a weakly disordered metal.

superstructures using four tomographic redshift bins with $0<z<0.8$ from the
DESI Legacy Survey, and measure the stacked CMB lensing and ISW signals around
them. To compare our measurements with $\Lambda$CDM model predictions, we
construct a mock catalogue with matched galaxy number density and bias, and
apply the same photo-$z$ uncertainty as the data. The consistency between the
mock and data is verified via the stacked galaxy density profiles around the
superstructures and their quantity. The corresponding lensing convergence and
ISW maps are then constructed and compared. The stacked lensing signal agrees
with data well except at the highest redshift bin in density peaks, where the
mock prediction is significantly higher, by approximately a factor 1.3. The
stacked ISW signal is generally consistent with the mock prediction. We do not
obtain a significant signal from voids, $A_{\rm ISW}=-0.10\pm0.69$, and the
signal from clusters, $A_{\rm ISW}=1.52\pm0.72$, is at best weakly detected.
However, these results are strongly inconsistent with previous claims of ISW

impressive success of Transformers in NLP tasks, targeting for purely
vision-based GUI understanding, we extend the concepts of Words/Sentence to
Pixel-Words/Screen-Sentence, and propose a mobile GUI understanding
architecture: Pixel-Words to Screen-Sentence (PW2SS). In analogy to the
individual Words, we define the Pixel-Words as atomic visual components (text
and graphic components), which are visually consistent and semantically clear
across screenshots of a large variety of design styles. The Pixel-Words
extracted from a screenshot are aggregated into Screen-Sentence with a Screen
Transformer proposed to model their relations. Since the Pixel-Words are
defined as atomic visual components, the ambiguity between their visual
appearance and semantics is dramatically reduced. We are able to make use of
metadata available in training data to auto-generate high-quality annotations
for Pixel-Words. A dataset, RICO-PW, of screenshots with Pixel-Words
annotations is built based on the public RICO dataset, which will be released
to help to address the lack of high-quality training data in this area. We
train a detector to extract Pixel-Words from screenshots on this dataset and
achieve metadata-free GUI understanding during inference. We conduct
experiments and show that Pixel-Words can be well extracted on RICO-PW and well
generalized to a new dataset, P2S-UI, collected by ourselves. The effectiveness
of PW2SS is further verified in the GUI understanding tasks including relation
prediction, clickability prediction, screen retrieval, and app type

dynamical properties of any model with either an analytical density profile or
an analytical surface density profile as starting point. We have extensively
validated SpheCow using a combination of comparisons to analytical and

double-stranded nucleic acids from a thin holding layer made of a high-density
material. Incoming particles break a series of strands along a roughly
co-linear chain of interaction sites and the severed segments then fall to a
collection area. Since the sequences of base pairs in nucleic acid molecules
can be precisely amplified and measured using polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
the original spatial position of each broken strand inside the detector can be
reconstructed with nm precision. Motivated by the potential use as a low-energy
directional particle tracker, we perform the first Monte Carlo simulations of
particle interactions inside a DNA detector. We compare the track topology as a
function of incoming direction, energy, and particle type for a range of
ionising particles. While particle identification and energy reconstruction
might be challenging without a significant scale-up, the excellent potential
angular and spatial resolution ($\lesssim 25^\circ$ axial resolution for a
keV-scale particles and nm-scale track segments) are clear advantages of this
concept. We conclude that a DNA detector could be a cost-effective, portable,

optimal timing and level of the peak demand, where it co-optimizes both

task, especially when looking at emotions in animals. This paper describes the
process of designing a ""proof of concept"" system to recognize emotions in
horses. This system is formed by two elements, a detector and a model. The
detector is a fast region-based convolutional neural network that detects
horses in an image. The model is a convolutional neural network that predicts
the emotions of those horses. These two elements were trained with multiple
images of horses until they achieved high accuracy in their tasks. In total,
400 images of horses were collected and labeled to train both the detector and
the model while 40 were used to test the system. Once the two components were
validated, they were combined into a testable system that would detect equine
emotions based on established behavioral ethograms indicating emotional affect
through head, neck, ear, muzzle and eye position. The system showed an accuracy
of 80% on the validation set and 65% on the test set, demonstrating that it is
possible to predict emotions in animals using autonomous intelligent systems.
Such a system has multiple applications including further studies in the
growing field of animal emotions as well as in the veterinary field to
determine the physical welfare of horses or other livestock.

discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) along with 40415 field galaxies to
calculate the rate of SNe Ia per galaxy in the redshift range $0.2 < z <0.6$.
We recover the known correlation between SN Ia rate and galaxy stellar mass
across a broad range of scales $8.5 \leq \log(M_*/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) \leq
11.25$. We find that the SN Ia rate increases with stellar mass as a power-law
with index $0.63 \pm 0.02$, which is consistent with previous work. We use an
empirical model of stellar mass assembly to estimate the average star-formation
histories (SFHs) of galaxies across the stellar mass range of our measurement.
Combining the modelled SFHs with the SN Ia rates to estimate constraints on the
SN Ia delay time distribution (DTD), we find the data are fit well by a
power-law DTD with slope index $\beta = -1.13 \pm 0.05$ and normalisation $A =
2.11 \pm0.05 \times
10^{-13}~\mathrm{SNe}~{\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which
corresponds to an overall SN Ia production efficiency $N_{\mathrm{Ia}}/M_* =
0.9~_{-0.7}^{+4.0} \times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{SNe}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}^{-1}$. Upon
splitting the SN sample by properties of the light curves, we find a strong
dependence on DTD slope with the SN decline rate, with slower-declining SNe
exhibiting a steeper DTD slope. We interpret this as a result of a relationship
between intrinsic luminosity and progenitor age, and explore the implications
of the result in the context of SN Ia progenitors.

model and consider both linear and learned nonlinear sensing mechanisms, where
the nonlinear one involves either a fully connected neural network or a
convolutional neural network. Recently, it has been argued that the
distribution of natural images do not lie in a single manifold but rather lie
in a union of several submanifolds. We propose a sparsity-driven latent space
sampling (SDLSS) framework and develop a proximal meta-learning (PML) algorithm
to enforce sparsity in the latent space. SDLSS allows the range-space of the
generator to be considered as a union-of-submanifolds. We also derive the
sample complexity bounds within the SDLSS framework for the linear measurement
model. The results demonstrate that for a higher degree of compression, the
SDLSS method is more efficient than the state-of-the-art method. We first
consider a comparison between linear and nonlinear sensing mechanisms on
Fashion-MNIST dataset and show that the learned nonlinear version is superior
to the linear one. Subsequent comparisons with the deep compressive sensing
(DCS) framework proposed in the literature are reported. We also consider the
effect of the dimension of the latent space and the sparsity factor in
validating the SDLSS framework. Performance quantification is carried out by
employing three objective metrics: peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
structural similarity index metric (SSIM), and reconstruction error (RE).

growth scheme for the stochastic, slow external driving force, differing from
the classical sandpile model, also resulted in power-law distributed avalanche

compression-flexion loading. Lumbar spine failure tolerance in combined
compression-flexion has not been widely explored in the literature. Therefore,
the goal of this study was to measure the failure tolerance of the lumbar spine
in combined compression and flexion. Forty 3-vertebra lumbar spine segments
were pre-loaded with axial compression and then subjected to dynamic flexion
bending until failure. Clinically relevant middle vertebra fractures were
observed in twenty-one of the specimens, including compression and burst
fractures. The remaining nineteen specimens experienced failure at the potting
grip interface. Since specimen characteristics and pre-test axial load varied
widely within the sample, failure forces (mean 3.4 kN, range 1.6-5.1 kN) and
moments (mean 73 Nm, range 0-181 Nm) also varied widely. Tobit univariate
regressions were performed to determine the relationship between censored
failure tolerance and specimen sex, segment type (upper/lower), age, and

Coulomb$\,+\,$linear-confining$\,+\,$hyperfine spin-spin interaction, with
parameters obtained by a simultaneous fit of around 100 masses of mesons and

the mechanism responsible of the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry. The
same mechanisms gives rise to Goldstone-boson exchange interactions between
quarks that have been fixed in the last 10-20 years reproducing hadron,

DoF manipulator arm equipped with a magnetic gripper, a highly efficient
storage system to transport box-shaped objects, and a water spraying system to
fight fires. The robot perceives its environment using 3D LiDAR as well as RGB

critical to risk assessment and decision making. Hence, a systematic study of

spatiotemporal forecasting problems: regular grid-based and graph-based. Then
we analyze UQ methods from both the Bayesian and the frequentist point of view,

extensive experiments on real-world road network traffic, epidemics, and air

in mean prediction, while confidence levels obtained from frequentist methods
provide more extensive coverage over data variations. Computationally, quantile
regression type methods are cheaper for a single confidence interval but
require re-training for different intervals. Sampling based methods generate
samples that can form multiple confidence intervals, albeit at a higher

field of machine learning is efficient to predict these interactions between

  Methods: In this study, we developed a framework to predict links between
human phenotype ontology (HPO) and genes. The annotation data from the
heterogeneous knowledge resources i.e., orphanet, is used to parse human
phenotype-gene associations. To generate the embeddings for the nodes (HPO &
genes), an algorithm called node2vec was used. It performs node sampling on
this graph based on random walks, then learns features over these sampled nodes
to generate embeddings. These embeddings were used to perform the downstream
task to predict the presence of the link between these nodes using 5 different
supervised machine learning algorithms.
  Results: The downstream link prediction task shows that the Gradient Boosting
Decision Tree based model (LightGBM) achieved an optimal AUROC 0.904 and AUCPR
0.784. In addition, LightGBM achieved an optimal weighted F1 score of 0.87.

squared error (MISE) as a generalization criterion, and use the asymptotic
behavior of the MISE as well as the locally optimal bandwidths (LOB) - the
bandwidth function that minimizes MISE in the asymptotic limit. The asymptotic
expression of our objective then reveals the dependence of the MISE on the
training density, enabling analytic minimization. As a result,we obtain the
optimal training density in a closed-form. The almost model-free nature of our
approach thus helps to encode the essential properties of the target problem,
providing a robust and model-agnostic active learning strategy. Furthermore,
the obtained training density factorizes the influence of local function
complexity, noise level and test density in a transparent and interpretable

system supporting operational processes, e.g., SAP. Whereas the data inside

data contain sensitive information that needs to be protected. This creates a
new risk and a possible inhibitor for applying process mining. Therefore,
privacy issues in process mining become increasingly important. Several privacy
preservation techniques have been introduced to mitigate possible attacks
against static event data published only once. However, to keep the process
mining results up-to-date, event data need to be published continuously. For
example, a new log is created at the end of each week. In this paper, we
elaborate on the attacks which can be launched against continuously publishing
anonymized event data by comparing different releases, so-called correspondence
attacks. Particularly, we focus on group-based privacy preservation techniques
and show that provided privacy requirements can be degraded exploiting
correspondence attacks. We apply the continuous event data publishing scenario
to existing real-life event logs and report the anonymity indicators before and

and Zenklusen, are a class of randomized rounding algorithms for converting a
fractional solution to a relaxation for a down-closed constraint family into an
integer solution. A CR scheme takes a fractional point $x$ in a relaxation
polytope, rounds each coordinate $x_i$ independently to get a possibly
non-feasible set, and then drops some elements in order to satisfy the
constraints. Intuitively, a contention resolution scheme is $c$-balanced if
every element $i$ is selected with probability at least $c \cdot x_i$.
  It is known that general matroids admit a $(1-1/e)$-balanced CR scheme, and
that this is (asymptotically) optimal. This is in particular true for the
special case of uniform matroids of rank one. In this work, we provide a simple
and explicit monotone CR scheme for uniform matroids of rank $k$ on $n$
elements with a balancedness of $1 -
\binom{n}{k}\:\left(1-\frac{k}{n}\right)^{n+1-k}\:\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^k$,
and show that this is optimal. As $n$ grows, this expression converges from
above to $1 - e^{-k}k^k/k!$. While this asymptotic bound can be obtained by
combining previously known results, these require defining an exponential-sized
linear program, as well as using random sampling and the ellipsoid algorithm.
Our procedure, on the other hand, has the advantage of being simple and
explicit. This scheme extends naturally into an optimal CR scheme for partition
matroids.

autonomy. Over the past two decades, numerous approaches have been developed to
account for errors in the vehicle path while navigating complex and often
uncertain environments. An important capability of such planning is the
prediction of vehicle dispersion covariances about a candidate path. This work
develops a new closed-loop linear covariance (CL-LinCov) framework applicable
to a wide range of autonomous system architectures. Important features of the
developed framework include the (1) separation of high-level guidance from
low-level control, (2) support for output-feedback controllers with internal
states, dynamics, and output, and (3) multi-use continuous sensors for
navigation state propagation, guidance, and feedback control. The closed-loop
nature of the framework preserves the important coupling between the system
dynamics, exogenous disturbances, and the guidance, navigation, and control
algorithms. The developed framework is applied to a simplified model of an

should allocate tasks to vehicles and schedule them in order to optimize both
throughput and fairness across customers. However, existing approaches to
scheduling tasks in mobility platforms ignore fairness.
  We introduce Mobius, a system that uses guided optimization to achieve both
high throughput and fairness across customers. Mobius supports spatiotemporally
diverse and dynamic customer demands. It provides a principled method to
navigate inherent tradeoffs between fairness and throughput caused by shared
mobility. Our evaluation demonstrates these properties, along with the
versatility and scalability of Mobius, using traces gathered from ridesharing
and aerial sensing applications. Our ridesharing case study shows that Mobius
can schedule more than 16,000 tasks across 40 customers and 200 vehicles in an

phonon surface states are visible, which is beneficial for experimental

paper, we study such a collection of tickets, which is referred to as ``winning
tickets'', in extremely over-parametrized models, e.g., pre-trained language
models. We observe that at certain compression ratios, the generalization
performance of the winning tickets can not only match but also exceed that of
the full model. In particular, we observe a phase transition phenomenon: As the
compression ratio increases, generalization performance of the winning tickets
first improves then deteriorates after a certain threshold. We refer to the
tickets on the threshold as ``super tickets''. We further show that the phase
transition is task and model dependent -- as the model size becomes larger and
the training data set becomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced.
Our experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve
single task fine-tuning by $0.9$ points on BERT-base and $1.0$ points on

modeller faces challenges such as poor parameter identifiability, lack of
sufficiently informative experimental data, and the existence of local minima
in the objective function landscape. These issues tend to worsen with larger
model sizes, increasing the computational complexity and the number of unknown

concerns the memory requirements of games over graphs using Muller conditions.

games using a given Muller condition is exactly the size of a minimal Rabin

that finding the chromatic memory requirements of a Muller condition is
NP-complete. This characterisation also allows us to prove that chromatic

key problems for finitely presented semigroups and monoids are tractable in

Electroencephalographic signals. Hence, frequency is substantially present in

the Time-Frequency Analysis. However, in spite of its importance as a keystone
in Signal Processing, and its seemingly simple meaning, its mathematical
foundation is not as straightforward as it may seem at first glance. A naive
interpretation of the different mathematical concepts modelling frequency can
be misleading, as their actual meanings essentially differ from the intuitive
notion which are supposed to represent. In our opinion, this circumstance
should be taken into account in order to develop appropriate signal analyzing

capability to handle frictional contact and slip of the multiple crossing
fractures. The slippage, opening and contact traction on fractures are
calculated by the resulted saddle-point algebraic system. A novel treatment is
devised to guarantee physical solutions at the intersected position of crossing
fractures. A preconditioning technique is introduced to re-scale the resulting
saddle-point algebraic system, to preserve the robustness of the system. An
iteration strategy, namely monolithic-updated contact algorithm, is then
designed to update the two primary unknowns (displacement and Lagrange
multiplier) in one algebraic block. Then, a series of numerical tests is
conducted to study the frictional contact and shear failure of single- and
multi-crossing fractures. Benchmark study is performed to verify the presented
mixed-FE scheme. Two tests with crossing fractures are studied, in which the
slippage and opening can be calculated. The effects of crossing fractures on

fundamental principles of sedimentation dynamics of elastic, nonheavy spheres
in bounded fluids are not well understood. Therefore, we performed
sedimentation of deformable, elastic solid spheres with particle Reynolds
numbers much smaller than 1 in a model experiment. The spheres started from
rest in a rectangular duct with a width of about 23 times the radius R of the
sphere. The particle dynamics of elastic spheres differed fundamentally from
that of rigid spheres. Elastic effects were found to take place on
comparatively large time scales, such that elastic spheres underwent four
phases of sedimentation. Phases I and II, including transient acceleration and
a short steady velocity plateau, are comparable with sedimentation of rigid
spheres. From a characteristic onset position of about 10R, deformability
effects kick in and a second acceleration appears (phase III). In the fourth
phase, the deformable spheres reach the terminal sedimentation velocity. The
softer the spheres are, the higher the terminal velocity is. In the present
setup, a terminal velocity up to 9 percent higher than the velocity for
comparable rigid spheres was reached. By means of the obtained data, insights
into the dynamics are given that could serve as basic approaches for modelling
the dynamics of elastic spheres in bounded fluids.

the key role of specific modality for sleep staging. To address these

originally proposed for salient object detection in computer vision. It is
mainly composed of two independent $\rm U^2$-like streams to extract the
salient features from multimodal data, respectively. Meanwhile, the multi-scale

adaptively capture valuable information from multimodal data for the specific

outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. It is worth noting that this model

of magnitude performance improvement compared to previous mixed-signal and
digital implementations. Next, a heterogeneous mixed-signal and mixed-precision
CPU-IMAC architecture is proposed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
inference on mobile processors, in which IMAC is designed as a co-processor to
realize fully-connected (FC) layers whereas convolution layers are executed in
CPU. Architecture-level analytical models are developed to evaluate the
performance and energy consumption of the CPU-IMAC architecture. Simulation
results exhibit 6.5% and 10% energy savings for CPU-IMAC based realizations of
LeNet and VGG CNN models, for MNIST and CIFAR-10 pattern recognition tasks,
respectively.

example will illustrate and justify this comment out of the classical tensorial
framework of the famous "" {\it equivalence problem} "". The case of contact

an array of unit cells that consist of two coupled varactor-loaded split-ring

generated in this type of metamaterial. To solve nonlinear equations, various
types of numerical methods can be applied by virtue of exact solutions, which
are always difficult to acquire. However, the initial conditions and
propagation distance impact the ultimate results. In this article, an
artificial neural network (ANN) was used as a supervised learning model to
predict the evolution and final mathematical expressions through training based
on samples with disparate initial conditions. Specifically, the influences of
the number of hidden layers were discussed. Additionally, the learning results
obtained by employing several training algorithms were analyzed and compared.

concerning the existence of geometric means, and the other is related to
establishing the parametric equation of an off-center circle, altogether

establishing mechanisms to automatically identify toxic and abusive content

concern of social media platform regulators. Although, automatic detection of
offensive content using deep learning approaches seems to provide encouraging
results, training deep learning-based models requires large amounts of
high-quality labeled data, which is often missing. In this regard, we present
in this paper a new deep learning-based method that fuses a Back Translation
method, and a Paraphrasing technique for data augmentation. Our pipeline
investigates different word-embedding-based architectures for classification of
hate speech. The back translation technique relies on an encoder-decoder
architecture pre-trained on a large corpus and mostly used for machine
translation. In addition, paraphrasing exploits the transformer model and the
mixture of experts to generate diverse paraphrases. Finally, LSTM, and CNN are
compared to seek enhanced classification results. We evaluate our proposal on
five publicly available datasets; namely, AskFm corpus, Formspring dataset,
Warner and Waseem dataset, Olid, and Wikipedia toxic comments dataset. The
performance of the proposal together with comparison to some related
state-of-art results demonstrate the effectiveness and soundness of our

such that clinically satisfactory radiation treatment plans can be created in

their initialization point and are slower than necessary due to plan
overparameterization. In this work, arc therapy overparameterization is
addressed by reducing the effective dimension of treatment plans with
unsupervised deep learning. An optimization engine is then built based on
low-dimensional arc representations which facilitates faster planning times.

representations comprising various descriptive parameters. There is hardly
research where system evolution is described on the base of information flows
in the system. The paper focuses on the link between the dynamics of
information and system evolution. Information, exchanged between different
system's parts, before being processed is first provided with meaning by the
system. Meanings are generated from the perspective of hindsight, i.e. against
the arrow of time. The same information can be differently interpreted by
different system's parts (i,e,provided with different meanings) so that the
number of options for possible system development is proliferated. Some options
eventually turn into observable system states. So that system evolutionary
dynamics can be considered as due to information processing within the system.
This process is considered here in a model representation. The model under
study is Triple Helix (TH) model, which was earlier used to describe
interactions between university, industry and government to foster innovations.
In TH model the system is comprised of three interacting parts where each part
process information ina different way. The model is not limited to the sphere
of innovation and can be used in a broader perspective. Here TH is
conceptualized in the framework of three compertment model used to describe
infectious disease. The paper demonstrates how the dynamics of information and
meaning can be incorporated in the description of Covid-19 infectious
propagation. The results show correspondence of model predictions with
observable infection dynamics.
