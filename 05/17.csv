separated surface-wave packets and point vortices interact in two horizontal
dimensions. We start with a Lagrangian which, in its general form, depends on
the \emph{fields} of wave action, wave phase, stream function, and two
additional fields that label and track the vertical component of vorticity. By
assuming that the wave action and vorticity are confined to infinitesimally
small, widely separated regions of the flow, we obtain model equations that are
analogous to, but significantly more general than, the familiar system
consisting solely of point vortices. We analyze stable and unstable harmonic
solutions, solutions in which wave packets eventually coincide with point
vortices (violating our assumptions), and solutions in which the wave vector
eventually blows up. Additionally, we show that a wave packet induces a net
drift on a passive vortex in the direction of wave propagation which is
equivalent to Darwin drift. Generalizing our analysis to many wave packets and
vortices, we examine the influence of wave packets on an otherwise unstable
vortex street and show analytically, according to linear stability analysis,
that the wave packet induced drift can stabilize the vortex street. The system
is then numerically integrated for long times and an example is shown in which
the configuration remains stable, which may be particularly relevant for the
upper ocean.

  during colonoscopy",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Colonoscopy remains the gold-standard screening for colorectal
cancer. However, significant miss rates for polyps have been reported,
particularly when there are multiple small adenomas. This presents an
opportunity to leverage computer-aided systems to support clinicians and reduce
the number of polyps missed.
  Method: In this work we introduce the Focus U-Net, a novel dual
attention-gated deep neural network, which combines efficient spatial and
channel-based attention into a single Focus Gate module to encourage selective
learning of polyp features. The Focus U-Net further incorporates short-range
skip connections and deep supervision. Furthermore, we introduce the Hybrid
Focal loss, a new compound loss function based on the Focal loss and Focal
Tversky loss, to handle class-imbalanced image segmentation. For our
experiments, we selected five public datasets containing images of polyps
obtained during optical colonoscopy: CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB,
ETIS-Larib PolypDB and EndoScene test set. To evaluate model performance, we
use the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU)
metrics.
  Results: Our model achieves state-of-the-art results for both CVC-ClinicDB
and Kvasir-SEG, with a mean DSC of 0.941 and 0.910, respectively. When
evaluated on a combination of five public polyp datasets, our model similarly
achieves state-of-the-art results with a mean DSC of 0.878 and mean IoU of
0.809, a 14% and 15% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art results of
0.768 and 0.702, respectively.
  Conclusions: This study shows the potential for deep learning to provide fast
and accurate polyp segmentation results for use during colonoscopy. The Focus
U-Net may be adapted for future use in newer non-invasive screening and more
broadly to other biomedical image segmentation tasks involving class imbalance
and requiring efficiency.

multiple dynamic objects have evolved to store individual objects in separate
reconstruction volumes and track the relative pose between them. While simple
and intuitive, such formulation does not scale well with respect to the number
of objects in the scene and introduces the need for an explicit occlusion
handling strategy. In contrast, we propose a map representation that allows
maintaining a single volume for the entire scene and all the objects therein.
To this end, we introduce a novel multi-object TSDF formulation that can encode
multiple object surfaces at any given location in the map. In a multiple
dynamic object tracking and reconstruction scenario, our representation allows
maintaining accurate reconstruction of surfaces even while they become
temporarily occluded by other objects moving in their proximity. We evaluate
the proposed TSDF++ formulation on a public synthetic dataset and demonstrate
its ability to preserve reconstructions of occluded surfaces when compared to
the standard TSDF map representation.

in 4--8 GHz continuum radiation and several spectral lines. The GLOSTAR survey
observed the 6.7~GHz transition of methanol (CH$_3$OH), an exclusive tracer of
high-mass young stellar objects. Using the Very Large Array in both the B and D
configurations, we observed an area in Cygnus~X of $7^{\rm o}\times3^{\rm o}$
in size and simultaneously covered the methanol line and the continuum,
allowing cross-registration. We detected thirteen sources with Class~II
methanol maser emission and one source with methanol absorption. Two methanol
maser sources are newly detected; in addition, we found four new velocity
components associated with known masers. Five masers are concentrated in the
DR21 ridge and W75N. We determined the characteristics of the detected masers
and investigated the association with infrared, (sub)millimeter, and radio
continuum emission. All maser sources are associated with (sub)millimeter dust
continuum emission, which is consistent with the picture of masers tracing
regions in an active stage of star formation. On the other hand, only five
masers ($38\pm17\%$) have radio continuum counterparts seen with GLOSTAR within

bolometric luminosity and the luminosity-to-mass ratio of cores that host
6.7~GHz methanol masers with those of the full core population, we identified

spurious oscillations at shocks, which leads to a significant reduction of the
overall approximation quality. Furthermore, a challenging task is to preserve
hyperbolicity of the gPC moment system. An intrusive method which guarantees
hyperbolicity is the intrusive polynomial moment (IPM) method, which performs
the gPC expansion on the entropy variables. The method, while still being
subject to oscillations, requires solving a convex optimization problem in
every spatial cell and every time step. The aim of this work is to mitigate
oscillations in the IPM solution by applying filters. Filters reduce
oscillations by damping high order gPC coefficients. Naive filtering, however,
may lead to unrealizable moments, which means that the IPM optimization problem
does not have a solution and the method breaks down. In this paper, we propose
and analyze two separate strategies to guarantee the existence of a solution to
the IPM problem. First, we propose a filter which maintains realizability by
being constructed from an underlying Fokker-Planck equation. Second, we
regularize the IPM optimization problem to be able to cope with non-realizable
gPC coefficients. Consequently, standard filters can be applied to the
regularized IPM method. We demonstrate numerical results for the two strategies
by investigating the Euler equations with uncertain shock structures in one-
and two-dimensional spatial settings. We are able to show a significant
reduction of spurious oscillations by the proposed filters.

issue for GP and the lack of a labeled dataset for DP, which can be
complemented by integrating both methods. To this end, this paper aims to
introduce a novel principle called \emph{combinatorial data augmentation}

GP-based datasets augmented from different combinations of positioning

DP's inputs. We confirm the CDA's effectiveness from field experiments based on
WiFi \emph{round-trip times} (RTTs) and \emph{inertial measurement units}

that CDA offers various metrics quantifying each PEL's reliability, thereby
filtering out unreliable PELs for WiFi RTT positioning. Second, CDA helps
compute the measurement covariance matrix of a Kalman filter for fusing two
position estimates derived by WiFi RTT and IMUs. Third, we use the above
position estimate as the corresponding PEL's real-time label for
fingerprint-based positioning as a representative DP algorithm. It provides
accurate and reliable positioning results, says an average positioning error of

taxes achieve optimal approximation. Three technical contributions underpin

NP-hard to approximate within a given factor depending solely on the admissible
resource costs. Second, we design a tractable taxation mechanism whose
efficiency (price of anarchy) matches this hardness factor, and thus is
worst-case optimal. As these results extend to coarse correlated equilibria,

and facial features often fall short of accurate emotion prediction in cases
where the aforementioned sources of affective information are inaccessible due
to head/body orientation, low resolution and poor illumination. We aspire to
alleviate this problem by leveraging visual context in the form of scene
characteristics and attributes, as part of a broader emotion recognition
framework. Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) constitute the backbone of our
proposed model. Apart from the RGB input modality, we make use of dense Optical
Flow, following an intuitive multi-stream approach for a more effective
encoding of motion. Furthermore, we shift our attention towards skeleton-based
learning and leverage action-centric data as means of pre-training a
Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) for the task of emotion
recognition. Our extensive experiments on the challenging Body Language Dataset
(BoLD) verify the superiority of our methods over existing approaches, while by
properly incorporating all of the aforementioned modules in a network ensemble,
we manage to surpass the previous best published recognition scores, by a large
margin.

allows direct applications of the deep convolutional neural networks for atomic

class-based local descriptors for downstream tasks such as statistical and
graph analysis. For atomically-resolved imaging data, the output is types and
positions of atomic species, with an option for subsequent refinement. AtomAI
further allows the implementation of a broad range of image and spectrum
analysis functions, including invariant variational autoencoders (VAEs). The
latter consists of VAEs with rotational and (optionally) translational
invariance for unsupervised and class-conditioned disentanglement of
categorical and continuous data representations. In addition, AtomAI provides
utilities for mapping structure-property relationships via im2spec and spec2im
type of encoder-decoder models. Finally, AtomAI allows seamless connection to
the first principles modeling with a Python interface, including molecular
dynamics and density functional theory calculations on the inferred atomic
position. While the majority of applications to date were based on atomically

examined using a capillary fiber bundle model, which is analytically solvable,
and a dynamic pore network model. The mixed wettability was implemented in the
models by allowing each tube or link to have a different wetting angle chosen
randomly from a given distribution. Both models showed that mixed wettability
can have significant influence on the rheology in terms of the dependence of
the global volumetric flow rate on the global pressure drop. In the capillary
fiber bundle model, for small pressure drops when only a small fraction of the
tubes were open, it was found that the volumetric flow rate depended on the
excess pressure drop as a power law with an exponent equal to 3/2 or 2
depending on the minimum pressure drop necessary for flow. When all the tubes
were open due to a high pressure drop, the volumetric flow rate depended
linearly on the pressure drop, independent of the wettability. In the
transition region in between where most of the tubes opened, the volumetric
flow depended more sensitively on the wetting angle distribution function and
was in general not a simple power law. The dynamic pore network model results
also showed a linear dependence of the flow rate on the pressure drop when the
pressure drop is large. However, out of this limit the dynamic pore network
model demonstrated a more complicated behaviour that depended on the mixed
wettability condition and the saturation. In particular, the exponent relating
volumetric flow rate to the excess pressure drop could take on values anywhere
between 1.0 and 1.8. The values of the exponent were highest for saturations
approaching 0.5, also, the exponent generally increased when the difference in
wettability of the two fluids were larger and when this difference was present
for a larger fraction of the porous network.

works as well as several theoretical models, e.g., motivated by the Gribov
problem. In this paper, we study formal aspects of propagators with complex
singularities in reconstructing Minkowski propagators starting from Euclidean
propagators by the analytic continuation. We derive the following properties
rigorously for propagators with arbitrary complex singularities satisfying some
boundedness condition. The two-point Schwinger function with complex
singularities violates the reflection positivity. In the presence of complex
singularities, while the holomorphy in the usual tube is maintained, the
reconstructed Wightman function on the Minkowski spacetime becomes a
non-tempered distribution and violates the positivity condition. On the other
hand, the Lorentz symmetry and locality are kept intact under this
reconstruction. Finally, we argue that complex singularities can be realized in
a state space with an indefinite metric and correspond to confined states. We
also discuss consequences of complex singularities in the BRST formalism. Our
results could open up a new way of understanding a confinement mechanism,
mainly in the Landau-gauge Yang-Mills theory.

to recast the entropy maximization problem as a so-called parameter synthesis

its influence on electron-electron interactions a difficult problem to
understand analytically. In this work, we study this problem in a topological
flatband of Chern number C=1 with the ideal properties that the Berry curvature

an exact correspondence between such ideal flatbands and Landau levels by
showing how the band geometry fluctuation in ideal flatbands gives raise to a
new type of interaction in Landau levels which depends on the center-of-mass of

Haldane pseudopotentials. This mapping gives exact zero-energy ground states
for short-ranged repulsive generalized pseudopotentials in flatbands, in
analogy to fractional quantum Hall systems. Driving the center-of-mass
interactions beyond the repulsive regime leads to a dramatic reconstruction of
the ground states towards gapless phases. The generalized pseudopotential could
be a useful basis for future numerical studies.

that our method is capable of resolving the evolution of the discontinuous

the triaxial deformation and the properties of the gravitational-wave emission
from triaxially rotating quark stars have been also studied, together with the
mass ejection of the differentially rotating case. It is found that
supramassive quark stars are not likely to be ideal sources of continuous
gravitational wave as the star recovers axisymmetry much faster than models
with smaller mass and gravitational-wave amplitude decays rapidly in a
timescale of $10\,$ms, although the instantaneous amplitude from more massive
models is larger. As with the differentially rotating case, our result confirms
that quark stars could experience non-axisymmetric instabilities similar to the
neutron star case but with quite small degree of differential rotation, which

of the covariance, we show that all the $q$-form fields have an ultralight mode

an universal mass scale for the ultralight modes of the bosonic fields. This
suggests that a new physics must emerge, for all theses fields, at the same

to geometrical couplings in such a configuration. The wave functions of fields
trapped in the crystal are Bloch-like waves, and their behavior is very similar
to electrons inside a lattice, just like in the Kronig-Penney model (KP). We
compute the mass dispersion relations for those fields with and without a

relation, there is no gap between the mass bands. Also, always that the field

Combining this result with min-max theory, we show that quasi-Fuchsian and
hyperbolic $3$-manifolds fibered over $\mathrm{S}^1$ admit smooth entire
foliations whose leaves are either minimal or have non-vanishing mean
curvature. We also conclude the existence of outermost minimal surfaces for

unifying explainable AI (XAI) by integrating machine learning and human

explainer to shift the beliefs of an explainee. This formalization decomposes
any XAI method into four components: (1) the inference to be explained, (2) the
explanatory medium, (3) the explainee model, and (4) the explainer model. The
abstraction afforded by Bayesian Teaching to decompose any XAI method
elucidates the invariances among them. The decomposition of XAI systems enables
modular validation, as each of the first three components listed can be tested
semi-independently. This decomposition also promotes generalization through
recombination of components from different XAI systems, which facilitates the
generation of novel variants. These new variants need not be evaluated one by
one provided that each component has been validated, leading to an exponential
decrease in development time. Finally, by making the goal of explanation
explicit, Bayesian Teaching helps developers to assess how suitable an XAI
system is for its intended real-world use case. Thus, Bayesian Teaching
provides a theoretical framework that encourages systematic, scientific

single-hop radio network model, where each device has a unique identifier in
$\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$. Energy is a scarce resource for small battery-powered
devices. For such devices, most of the energy is often spent on communication,
not on computation. To approximate the actual energy cost, the energy
complexity of an algorithm is defined as the maximum over all devices of the
number of time slots where the device transmits or listens. Much progress has
been made in understanding the energy complexity of leader election in radio
networks, but very little is known about the trade-off between time and energy.
  $\textbf{Time-energy trade-off:}$ For any $k \geq \log \log N$, we show that
a leader among at most $n$ devices can be elected deterministically in $O(k
\cdot n^{1+\epsilon}) + O(k \cdot N^{1/k})$ time and $O(k)$ energy if each
device can simultaneously transmit and listen, where $\epsilon > 0$ is any
small constant. This improves upon the previous $O(N)$-time $O(\log \log

show that the time-energy trade-off of our algorithm is near-optimal.
  $\textbf{Dense instances:}$ For the dense instances where the number of
devices is $n = \Theta(N)$, we design a deterministic leader election algorithm
using only $O(1)$ energy. This improves upon the $O(\log^* N)$-energy algorithm

deterministic energy complexity of leader election is
$\Theta\left(\max\left\{1, \log \frac{N}{n}\right\}\right)$ if the devices

Sleeping Giants online activist movement gained traction in Brazil. Its
rationale was simple: to curb the spread of misinformation by harming the
advertising revenue of sources that produce this type of content. Like its
international counterparts, Sleeping Giants Brasil (SGB) campaigned against
media outlets using Twitter to ask companies to remove ads from the targeted
outlets. This work presents a thorough quantitative characterization of this
activism model, analyzing the three campaigns carried out by SGB between May
and September 2020. To do so, we use digital traces from both Twitter and
Google Trends, toxicity and sentiment classifiers trained for the Portuguese
language, and an annotated corpus of SGB's tweets. Our key findings were
threefold. First, we found that SGB's requests to companies were largely
successful (with 83.85\% of all 192 targeted companies responding positively)
and that user pressure was correlated to the speed of companies' responses.
Second, there were no significant changes in the online attention and the user
engagement going towards the targeted media outlets in the six months that
followed SGB's campaign (as measured by Google Trends and Twitter engagement).
Third, we observed that user interactions with companies changed only
transiently, even if the companies did not respond to SGB's request. Overall,
our results paint a nuanced portrait of internet activism. On the one hand,
they suggest that SGB was successful in getting companies to boycott specific
media outlets, which may have harmed their advertisement revenue stream. On the
other hand, they also suggest that the activist movement did not impact the

factors, and aggregate claims and stock prices are subject to common shocks,

pandemics, that have an immediate impact on the financial market and
simultaneously induce insurance claims. Using the classical stochastic control
approach based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, we provide a
verification result for the value function via classical solutions to two
backward partial differential equations and characterize the optimal
reinsurance and investment strategies. Finally, we make a comparison analysis

lot of attention recently due to their relation to approximation algorithms:
constant degree semi-algebraic proofs lead to conjecturally optimal
polynomial-time approximation algorithms for important NP-hard optimization
problems. Motivated by the need to allow a more streamlined and uniform
framework for working with SoS proofs than the restrictive propositional level,
we initiate a systematic first-order logical investigation into the kinds of
reasoning possible in algebraic and semi-algebraic proof systems. Specifically,
we develop first-order theories that capture in a precise manner constant
degree algebraic and semi-algebraic proof systems: every statement of a certain
form that is provable in our theories translates into a family of constant
degree polynomial calculus or SoS refutations, respectively; and using a
reflection principle, the converse also holds.
  This places algebraic and semi-algebraic proof systems in the established
framework of bounded arithmetic, while providing theories corresponding to
systems that vary quite substantially from the usual propositional-logic ones.
  We give examples of how our semi-algebraic theory proves statements such as
the pigeonhole principle, we provide a separation between algebraic and
semi-algebraic theories, and we describe initial attempts to go beyond these
theories by introducing extensions that use the inequality symbol, identifying
along the way which extensions lead outside the scope of constant degree SoS.
Moreover, we prove new results for propositional proofs, and specifically
extend Berkholz's dynamic-by-static simulation of polynomial calculus (PC) by
SoS to PC with the radical rule.

Europe, and utilized large-scale CXR pretraining, attention pooling, and noisy
student semi-supervised learning. Evaluation was on (1) a combined test set
spanning China, India, US, and Zambia, and (2) an independent mining population
in South Africa. Given WHO targets of 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity, the
DLS's operating point was prespecified to favor sensitivity over specificity.
On the combined test set, the DLS's ROC curve was above all 9 India-based
radiologists, with an AUC of 0.90 (95%CI 0.87-0.92). The DLS's sensitivity
(88%) was higher than the India-based radiologists (75% mean sensitivity),
p<0.001 for superiority; and its specificity (79%) was non-inferior to the
radiologists (84% mean specificity), p=0.004. Similar trends were observed
within HIV positive and sputum smear positive sub-groups, and in the South
Africa test set. We found that 5 US-based radiologists (where TB isn't endemic)
were more sensitive and less specific than the India-based radiologists (where
TB is endemic). The DLS also remained non-inferior to the US-based
radiologists. In simulations, using the DLS as a prioritization tool for
confirmatory testing reduced the cost per positive case detected by 40-80%
compared to using confirmatory testing alone. To conclude, our DLS generalized
to 5 countries, and merits prospective evaluation to assist cost-effective
screening efforts in radiologist-limited settings. Operating point flexibility
may permit customization of the DLS to account for site-specific factors such

accelerator hardware due to lower power usage, reduced data movement and
increased computational performance. However, computational science and
engineering (CSE) problems require double precision accuracy in several
domains. This conflict between hardware trends and application needs has
resulted in a need for multiprecision strategies at the linear algebra
algorithms level if we want to exploit the hardware to its full potential while
meeting the accuracy requirements. In this paper, we focus on preconditioned
sparse iterative linear solvers, a key kernel in several CSE applications. We
present a study of multiprecision strategies for accelerating this kernel on
GPUs. We seek the best methods for incorporating multiple precisions into the
GMRES linear solver; these include iterative refinement and parallelizable
preconditioners. Our work presents strategies to determine when multiprecision
GMRES will be effective and to choose parameters for a multiprecision iterative
refinement solver to achieve better performance. We use an implementation that
is based on the Trilinos library and employs Kokkos Kernels for performance
portability of linear algebra kernels. Performance results demonstrate the
promise of multiprecision approaches and demonstrate even further improvements
are possible by optimizing low-level kernels.

of ill-conditioned non-convex optimization problems. First-order methods, such
as SGD and ADAM, and quasi-Newton methods, such as BFGS and L-BFGS, have been
applied with some success to optimization problems involving deep neural
networks in computational engineering inverse problems. However, empirical
evidence shows that convergence and accuracy for these methods remain a
challenge. Our study unveiled at least two intrinsic defects of these methods
when applied to coupled systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) and
deep neural networks (DNNs): (1) convergence is often slow with long plateaus
that make it difficult to determine whether the method has converged or not;
(2) quasi-Newton methods do not provide a sufficiently accurate approximation
of the Hessian matrix; this typically leads to early termination (one of the
stopping criteria of the optimizer is satisfied although the achieved error is
far from minimal). Based on these observations, we propose to use trust region
methods for optimizing coupled systems of PDEs and DNNs. Specifically, we
developed an algorithm for second-order physics constrained learning, an
efficient technique to calculate Hessian matrices based on computational
graphs. We show that trust region methods overcome many of the defects and
exhibit remarkable fast convergence and superior accuracy compared to ADAM,

prototype-supervised adversarial network (ProS-GAN), which formulates a
flexible generative architecture for efficient and effective targeted hashing
attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generation-based method
to attack deep hashing networks. Generally, our proposed framework consists of
three parts, i.e., a PrototypeNet, a generator, and a discriminator.
Specifically, the designed PrototypeNet embeds the target label into the
semantic representation and learns the prototype code as the category-level
representative of the target label. Moreover, the semantic representation and
the original image are jointly fed into the generator for a flexible targeted
attack. Particularly, the prototype code is adopted to supervise the generator
to construct the targeted adversarial example by minimizing the Hamming
distance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the prototype
code. Furthermore, the generator is against the discriminator to simultaneously
encourage the adversarial examples visually realistic and the semantic
representation informative. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed
framework can efficiently produce adversarial examples with better targeted
attack performance and transferability over state-of-the-art targeted attack
methods of deep hashing. The related codes could be available at

statistically noisier indicators of default risk for historically under-served
groups. This noise emerges primarily through the explanatory power of the
underlying credit report data (e.g., thin credit files), not through issues
with model fit (e.g., the inability to include protected class in the scoring
model). Estimating a structural model of lending with heterogeneity in

disparities for the US mortgage market. We find that equalizing the precision
of credit scores can reduce disparities in approval rates and in credit
misallocation for disadvantaged groups by approximately half.

establish an equivalence between the conditional independence and the mutual
independence. Based on the equivalence, we propose an index to measure the
conditional dependence by quantifying the mutual dependence among the
transformed variables. The proposed index has several appealing properties. (a)
It is distribution free since the limiting null distribution of the proposed
index does not depend on the population distributions of the data. Hence the
critical values can be tabulated by simulations. (b) The proposed index ranges
from zero to one, and equals zero if and only if the conditional independence
holds. Thus, it has nontrivial power under the alternative hypothesis. (c) It
is robust to outliers and heavy-tailed data since it is invariant to
conditional strictly monotone transformations. (d) It has low computational
cost since it incorporates a simple closed-form expression and can be
implemented in quadratic time. (e) It is insensitive to tuning parameters
involved in the calculation of the proposed index. (f) The new index is
applicable for multivariate random vectors as well as for discrete data. All
these properties enable us to use the new index as statistical inference tools
for various data. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through
extensive simulations and a real application on causal discovery.

  quasi-exchangeability",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper aims to systematically solve stochastic team optimization of
large-scale system, in a rather general framework. Concretely, the underlying
large-scale system involves considerable weakly-coupled cooperative agents for
which the individual admissible controls: (\textbf{i}) enter the diffusion
terms, (\textbf{ii}) are constrained in some closed-convex subsets, and
(\textbf{iii}) subject to a general \emph{partial decentralized information}
structure. A more important but serious feature: (\textbf{iv}) all agents are
heterogenous with \emph{continuum} instead \emph{finite} diversity. Combination
of (\textbf{i})-(\textbf{iv}) yields a quite general modeling of stochastic
team-optimization, but on the other hand, also fails current existing
techniques of team analysis. In particular, classical team consistency with
continuum heterogeneity collapses because of (\textbf{i}). As the resolution, a
novel \emph{unified approach} is proposed under which the intractable
\emph{continuum} \emph{heterogeneity} can be converted to a more tractable
\emph{homogeneity}. As a trade-off, the underlying randomness is augmented, and
all agents become (quasi) weakly-exchangeable. Such approach essentially
involves a subtle balance between homogeneity v.s. heterogeneity, and left
(prior-sampling)- v.s. right (posterior-sampling) information filtration.
Subsequently, the consistency condition (CC) system takes a new type of
forward-backward stochastic system with \emph{double-projections} (due to
(\textbf{ii}), (\textbf{iii})), along with \emph{spatial mean} on continuum
heterogenous index (due to (\textbf{iv})). Such system is new in team
literature and its well-posedness is also challenging. We address this issue
under mild conditions. Related asymptotic optimality is also established.

performance across various domains. However, when learning tasks sequentially,
the networks easily forget the knowledge of previous tasks, known as
""catastrophic forgetting"". To achieve the consistencies between the old tasks
and the new task, one effective solution is to modify the gradient for update.
Previous methods enforce independent gradient constraints for different tasks,
while we consider these gradients contain complex information, and propose to
leverage inter-task information by gradient decomposition. In particular, the
gradient of an old task is decomposed into a part shared by all old tasks and a
part specific to that task. The gradient for update should be close to the
gradient of the new task, consistent with the gradients shared by all old
tasks, and orthogonal to the space spanned by the gradients specific to the old
tasks. In this way, our approach encourages common knowledge consolidation
without impairing the task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the optimization is
performed for the gradients of each layer separately rather than the
concatenation of all gradients as in previous works. This effectively avoids
the influence of the magnitude variation of the gradients in different layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of both gradient-decomposed
optimization and layer-wise updates. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks of continual learning.

learning models, for detecting and classifying COVID-19 becomes popular
recently. It removes the need for in-person testing procedures especially for
rural regions where related medical supplies, experienced workers, and
equipment are limited. However, existing sound-based diagnostic approaches are
trained in a fully supervised manner, which requires large scale well-labelled
data. It is critical to discover new methods to leverage unlabelled respiratory
data, which can be obtained more easily. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised learning enabled framework for COVID-19 cough classification. A
contrastive pre-training phase is introduced to train a Transformer-based
feature encoder with unlabelled data. Specifically, we design a random masking
mechanism to learn robust representations of respiratory sounds. The
pre-trained feature encoder is then fine-tuned in the downstream phase to
perform cough classification. In addition, different ensembles with varied
random masking rates are also explored in the downstream phase. Through
extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed contrastive
pre-training, the random masking mechanism, and the ensemble architecture
contribute to improving cough classification performance.

  Dimensional Analysis","7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ITW2021",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coded distributed matrix multiplication (CDMM) schemes, such as MatDot codes,
seek efficient ways to distribute matrix multiplication task(s) to a set of $N$
distributed servers so that the answers returned from any $R$ servers are
sufficient to recover the desired product(s). For example, to compute the
product of matrices ${\bf U, V}$, MatDot codes partition each matrix into $p>1$
sub-matrices to create smaller coded computation tasks that reduce the
upload/storage at each server by $1/p$, such that ${\bf UV}$ can be recovered
from the answers returned by any $R=2p-1$ servers. An important concern in CDMM
is to reduce the recovery threshold $R$ for a given storage/upload constraint.
Recently, Jeong et al. introduced Approximate MatDot (AMD) codes that are shown
to improve the recovery threshold by a factor of nearly $2$, from $2p-1$ to
$p$. A key observation that motivates our work is that the storage/upload
required for approximate computing depends not only on the dimensions of the
(coded) sub-matrices that are assigned to each server, but also on their
precision levels -- a critical aspect that is not explored by Jeong et al. Our
main contribution is a dimensional analysis of AMD codes inspired by the
Generalized Degrees of Freedom (GDoF) framework previously developed for
wireless networks, which indicates that for the same upload/storage, once the
precision levels of the task assignments are accounted for, AMD codes
surprisingly fall short in all aspects to even the trivial replication scheme
which assigns the full computation task to every server. Indeed, the trivial
replication scheme has a much better recovery threshold of $1$, better download
cost, better computation cost, and much better encoding/decoding (none
required) complexity than AMD codes. The dimensional analysis is supported by
simple numerical experiments.

individual genes, identification of gene pathways, i.e., a set of genes with
known interactions that collectively contribute to specific biological
functions, can provide more biologically meaningful results. Such gene pathway
analysis can be formulated into a high-dimensional two-sample testing problem.
Due to the typically limited sample size of gene expression datasets, most
existing two-sample tests may have compromised powers because they ignore or
only inefficiently incorporate the auxiliary pathway information on gene
interactions. We propose T2-DAG, a Hotelling's $T^2$-type test for detecting
differentially expressed gene pathways, which efficiently leverages the
auxiliary pathway information on gene interactions through a linear structural
equation model. We establish the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic
under pertinent assumptions. Simulation studies under various scenarios show
that T2-DAG outperforms several representative existing methods with
well-controlled type-I error rates and substantially improved powers, even with
incomplete or inaccurate pathway information or unadjusted confounding effects.
We also illustrate the performance of T2-DAG in an application to detect

are not as linguistically insightful as desired. On the other hand, earlier
studies use rather simple lexical features, missing logical relations between

statements, namely (i) factual consistency, (ii) sentiment coherence, (iii)
causal relation, and (iv) normative relation. We demonstrate that our
operationalization of these logical mechanisms classifies argumentative

significantly better than several unsupervised baselines. We further
demonstrate that these mechanisms also improve supervised classifiers through

systematically analyze the attack model of signal injection attacks toward
moving vehicles. By considering the potential threats, we propose SoundFence, a
physical-layer defense system which leverages the sensors' signal processing
capability without requiring any additional equipment. SoundFence verifies the
benign measurement results and detects signal injection attacks by analyzing

inaccurate predictions. Spear Phishing detection also faces scalability
challenges due to the growth of the required features which is proportional to
the number of the senders within a receiver mailbox. This differs from
traditional phishing attacks which typically perform only a binary
classification between phishing and benign emails. Therefore, we devise a
possible solution to these problems, named RAIDER: Reinforcement AIded Spear
Phishing DEtectoR. A reinforcement-learning based feature evaluation system
that can automatically find the optimum features for detecting different types
of attacks. By leveraging a reward and penalty system, RAIDER allows for

reduce the dimensions of the required features by 55% in comparison to existing
ML-based systems. It also improves the accuracy of detecting spoofing attacks
by 4% from 90% to 94%. In addition, RAIDER demonstrates reasonable detection
accuracy even against a sophisticated attack named Known Sender in which
spear-phishing emails greatly resemble those of the impersonated sender.

  Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2021)",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  IP networking deals with end-to-end communication where the network layer
routing protocols maintain the reachability from one address to another.
However, challenging environments, such as mobile ad-hoc networks or MANETs,
lead to frequent path failures and changes between the sender and receiver,
incurring higher packet loss. The obligatory route setup and maintenance of a
device-to-device stable path in MANETs incur significant data retrieval delay
and transmission overhead. Such overhead exaggerates the packet loss manifold.
  Named Data Networking (NDN) can avoid such delays and overhead and
significantly improve the overall network performance. It does so with direct
application-controlled named-data retrieval from any node in a network instead
of reaching a specific IP address with protocol message exchange. However,
existing works lack any explicit or systematic analysis to justify such claims.
Our work analyzes the core NDN and IP architectures in a MANET at a baseline
level. The extensive simulations show that NDN, when applied correctly, yields
much lower data retrieval latency than IP and can lower the network
transmission overhead in most cases. As a result, NDN's stateful forwarder can
significantly increase the retrieval rate, offering a better trade-off at the
network layer. Such performance comes from its caching, built-in multicast, and
request aggregation without requiring an IP-like separate routing control
plane.

shopping, which accounts for an increasing portion of either fashion retailing

recommendation model lies in capturing two types of patterns: the personal
fashion preference of users and the transitional relationships between adjacent
items. The two types of patterns are usually related to user-item interaction
and item-item transition modeling respectively. However, due to the large sets
of users and items as well as the sparse historical interactions, it is
difficult to train an effective and efficient sequential fashion recommendation
model. To tackle these problems, we propose to leverage two types of global
graph, i.e., the user-item interaction graph and item-item transition graph, to
obtain enhanced user and item representations by incorporating higher-order
connections over the graphs. In addition, we adopt the graph kernel of LightGCN
for the information propagation in both graphs and propose a new design for
item-item transition graph. Extensive experiments on two established sequential
fashion recommendation datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of
our approach.

neutron-rich nuclei is that many of them couple to unbound neutron in continuum
single-particle orbits. The continuum random phase approximation (cRPA) is a
powerful many-body method that describes such excitations, and it provides a
scheme to evaluate transition strengths from the ground state. In an attempt to
apply cRPA to the radiative neutron capture reaction, we formulate in the
present study an extended scheme of cRPA that describes gamma-transitions from
the excited states under consideration, which decay to low-lying excited states
as well as the ground state. This is achieved by introducing a non-local
one-body operator which causes transitions to a low-lying excited state, and
describing a density-matrix response against this operator. As a demonstration
of this new scheme, we perform numerical calculation for dipole, quadrupole,
and octupole excitations in $^{140}$Sn, and discuss E1 and E2 transitions
decaying to low-lying $2^{+}_{1,2}$ and $3^{-}_{1}$ states. The results point
to cases where the branching ratio to the low-lying states is larger than or

features are utilized as auxiliary information to address the sparsity problem
caused by insufficient user-item interactions. However, extracted user features
generally contain rich multimodal information, and most of them are irrelevant
to the recommendation purpose. Therefore, excessive reliance on these features
will make the model overfit on noise and difficult to generalize. In this
article, we propose a variational bandwidth auto-encoder (VBAE) for
recommendations, aiming to address the sparsity and noise problems
simultaneously. VBAE first encodes user collaborative and feature information
into Gaussian latent variables via deep neural networks to capture non-linear
user similarities. Moreover, by considering the fusion of collaborative and
feature variables as a virtual communication channel from an
information-theoretic perspective, we introduce a user-dependent channel to
dynamically control the information allowed to be accessed from the feature
embeddings. A quantum-inspired uncertainty measurement of the hidden rating
embeddings is proposed accordingly to infer the channel bandwidth by
disentangling the uncertainty information in the ratings from the semantic
information. Through this mechanism, VBAE incorporates adequate auxiliary
information from user features if collaborative information is insufficient,
while avoiding excessive reliance on noisy user features to improve its
generalization ability to new users. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Codes

theory that differ in the location of the source being either in the transition
region near the Sun or in the solar wind, itself. The two classes of theory
differ in their predictions of the switchback rate as a function of distance
from the Sun. To test these theories, one-hour averages of Parker Solar Probe
data were summed over orbits three through seven. It is found that:
  1. The average switchback rate was independent of distance from the Sun. 2.
The average switchback rate increased with solar wind speed. 3. The switchback
size perpendicular to the flow increased as R, the distance from the Sun, while
the radial size increased as R2, resulting in a large and increasing switchback
aspect ratio with distance from the Sun. 4. The switchback rotation angle did
not depend on either the solar wind speed or the distance from the Sun.
  These results are consistent with switchback formation in the transition
region because their increase of tangential size with radius compensates for
the radial falloff of their equatorial density to produce switchback rates that
are independent of distance from the Sun. This constant observed switchback
rate is inconsistent with an in situ source. Once formed, the switchback size
and aspect ratio, but not the rotation angle, increased with radial distance to
at least 100 solar radii. In addition, quiet intervals between switchback
patches occurred at the lowest solar wind speeds.

with many out-of-the-box functionalities to accelerate experimentation and
deployment. These practical functionalities are heterogeneity simulation,
comprehensive tracking, distributed training optimization, and seamless
deployment. They are proposed based on challenges identified in the proposed FL
life cycle. Compared with other platforms, EasyFL not only requires just three
lines of code (at least 10x lesser) to build a vanilla FL application but also
incurs lower training overhead. Besides, our evaluations demonstrate that
EasyFL expedites distributed training by 1.5x. It also improves the efficiency

recoded packets to be transmitted for different batches in a flow, which is
called adaptive recoding. Due to both the probably nonconcave objective and the
BATS code-related variables, the algorithms developed for the existing flow
optimization problems cannot be applied directly to solve our NUM problem. We
introduce a two-step algorithm to solve our NUM problem, where the first step
solves the problem with nonadaptive recoding schemes, and the second step
optimizes adaptive recoding hop-by-hop from upstream to downstream in each

for unlabeled data in a target domain, given labeled data in a source domain,
whose data distributions differ from the target domain. However, existing works
are inapplicable to face recognition under privacy constraints because they
require sharing sensitive face images between two domains. To address this
problem, we propose a novel unsupervised federated face recognition approach
(FedFR). FedFR improves the performance in the target domain by iteratively
aggregating knowledge from the source domain through federated learning. It
protects data privacy by transferring models instead of raw data between
domains. Besides, we propose a new domain constraint loss (DCL) to regularize
source domain training. DCL suppresses the data volume dominance of the source
domain. We also enhance a hierarchical clustering algorithm to predict pseudo
labels for the unlabeled target domain accurately. To this end, FedFR forms an
end-to-end training pipeline: (1) pre-train in the source domain; (2) predict
pseudo labels by clustering in the target domain; (3) conduct
domain-constrained federated learning across two domains. Extensive experiments
and analysis on two newly constructed benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedFR. It outperforms the baseline and classic methods in the target domain
by over 4% on the more realistic benchmark. We believe that FedFR will shed
light on applying federated learning to more computer vision tasks under
privacy constraints.

fluctuations in the number of erasures in individual batches, it is not optimal
to recode and transmit the same number of packets for all batches. Different
distributed optimization models, which are called adaptive recoding schemes,
were formulated for this purpose. The key component of these optimization
problems is the expected value of the rank distribution of a batch at the next

forth a unified adaptive recoding framework with an arbitrary recoding field
size. We show that the expected rank functions are concave when the packet loss
pattern is a stationary stochastic process, which covers but not limited to
independent packet loss and Gilbert-Elliott packet loss model. Under this
concavity assumption, we show that there always exists a solution which not
only can minimize the randomness on the number of recoded packets but also can
tolerate rank distribution errors due to inaccurate measurements or limited

optimal solution, and propose tuning schemes that can turn any feasible

has significant throughput gain for small batch size compared with the existing

pre-trained with classification tasks before being used in translation process.
The study reports quantitative as well as qualitative results with Precision,
Recall, Density, and Coverage. The proposed three losses lead to the
enhancement of the level of diversity compared to the conventional KL loss. In
particular, SRGAN is found to be successful in translating with higher

challenges: (1) labeled datasets are usually limited in size, making them
insufficient to train supervised neural models; (2) there is a training-test
gap for unsupervised language modeling (LM) based models to compute semantic
scores between sentences, since sentence-level semantics are not explicitly
modeled at training. This results in inferior performances in this task. In
this work, we propose a new framework to address these two issues. The proposed
framework is based on the core idea that the meaning of a sentence should be
defined by its contexts, and that sentence similarity can be measured by
comparing the probabilities of generating two sentences given the same context.
The proposed framework is able to generate high-quality, large-scale dataset
with semantic similarity scores between two sentences in an unsupervised
manner, with which the train-test gap can be largely bridged. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed framework achieves significant performance
boosts over existing baselines under both the supervised and unsupervised

extract relevant cells from the table along with relevant spans from the text

our TAT-QA is very challenging and can serve as a benchmark for training and

technique based on a novel data-adaptive similarity measure, called Random
Forest Activation Pattern (RFAP) similarity. The RFAP similarity is generated

guide the clustering of unlabelled scenarios. It consists of three steps.
First, a self-supervised Convolutional Neural Network~(CNN) is trained on all

the CNN is fine-tuned for classification of the labelled scenarios. Third,
using the labelled and unlabelled scenarios an iterative optimisation procedure
is performed for clustering. In the third step at each epoch of the iterative
optimisation, the CNN is used as a feature generator for an unsupervised Random

Their large spectral bandwidth, high output powers and quantum-limited
linewidths have facilitated the realization of THz pulses by active
mode-locking and passive generation of optical frequency combs (FCs) through
intracavity four-wave-mixing, albeit over a restricted operational regime.
Here, we conceive an integrated architecture for the generation of high power
(10 mW) THz FCs comprising an ultrafast THz polaritonic reflector, exploiting
intersubband cavity polaritons, and a broad bandwidth (2.3-3.8 THz)
heterogeneous THz QCL. Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) represent a fascinating
accomplishment of quantum engineering and enable the direct generation of
terahertz (THz) frequency radiation from an electrically-biased semiconductor
heterostructure. By tuning the group delay dispersion in an integrated
geometry, through the exploitation of light induced bleaching of the
intersubband-based THz polaritons, we demonstrate spectral reshaping of the QCL
emission and stable FC operation over an operational dynamic range of up to
38%, characterized by a single and narrow (down to 700 Hz) intermode beatnote.
Our concept provides design guidelines for a new generation of compact,
cost-effective, electrically driven chip-scale FC sources based on ultrafast
polariton dynamics, paving the way towards the generation of mode locked THz
micro-lasers that will strongly impact a broad range of applications in
ultrafast sciences, data storage, high-speed communication and spectroscopy.

manually labelled 3D data as supervision signals. However, annotating large
datasets requires huge human efforts, especially for 3D area. To tackle this
problem, we propose frustum-aware geometric reasoning (FGR) to detect vehicles
in point clouds without any 3D annotations. Our method consists of two stages:
coarse 3D segmentation and 3D bounding box estimation. For the first stage, a
context-aware adaptive region growing algorithm is designed to segment objects
based on 2D bounding boxes. Leveraging predicted segmentation masks, we develop
an anti-noise approach to estimate 3D bounding boxes in the second stage.
Finally 3D pseudo labels generated by our method are utilized to train a 3D
detector. Independent of any 3D groundtruth, FGR reaches comparable performance
with fully supervised methods on the KITTI dataset. The findings indicate that
it is able to accurately detect objects in 3D space with only 2D bounding boxes

cooperative behavior between parts of an initially disordered system without
external control or influence. It has been introduced to multi-agent systems as
an internal control process or mechanism to solve difficult problems
spontaneously. However, because a self-organizing multi-agent system has
autonomous agents and local interactions between them, it is difficult to
predict the behavior of the system from the behavior of the local agents we
design. This paper proposes a logic-based framework of self-organizing
multi-agent systems, where agents interact with each other by following their
prescribed local rules. The dependence relation between coalitions of agents
regarding their contributions to the global behavior of the system is reasoned
about from the structural and semantic perspectives. We show that the
computational complexity of verifying such a self-organizing multi-agent system
is in exponential time. We then combine our framework with graph theory to
decompose a system into different coalitions located in different layers, which
allows us to verify agents' full contributions more efficiently. The resulting
information about agents' full contributions allows us to understand the
complex link between local agent behavior and system level behavior in a
self-organizing multi-agent system. Finally, we show how we can use our
framework to model a constraint satisfaction problem.

a spherical shell. The scheme adopts a solution of the conduction equation in
each interval of the chosen discretization that is valid if the fluxes at
interval boundaries are constant in time. This piece-wise steady flux (PWSF)
numerical scheme is continuous and differentiable in the space domain, which is
convenient for implementing the numerical scheme in an energy-conserved thermal
evolution model of a planetary core in which a conductive stratified layer
develops below the core-mantle boundary when the heat flux is subadiabatic. The
influence of a time-variable stratified region on the general evolution of the
planetary body is examined, in comparison to imposing an adiabatic temperature
profile for the core. By considering stratification in a planetary core where
the heat flux is subadiabatic, radial variations in the cooling rate are
accounted for whereas otherwise the distribution of energy in the core is fixed
by the imposed adiabat. During the growth of the thermally stratified region,
the deep part of the core cools more rapidly than the outer part of the core.
Therefore, the inner core grows to a larger size and the temperature and heat
flux at the core-mantle boundary are higher and larger, respectively, if a
stratified region is considered. For the Earth, the implications are likely
very minor and can be neglected in thermal evolution studies that are not
specifically interested in the stratified region itself. For Mercury, these
implications are much larger. For example, the age of the inner core can be
underestimated by several billion years if thermal stratification is neglected.
Consideration of thermal stratification in the core of Mercury also increases
the mantle temperature, leads to a larger heat flux into the lithosphere, and
prolongs mantle convection.

for cloud ready transport networks. The model takes into account four flow
types (i.e., city-to-city, city-to-data center, data center-to-data center and
data center-to-data center) while the flow characteristics are based on real
economical and geographical parameters of the cities related to network nodes.
Then, we propose dedicated flow allocation algorithm that can be supported by
the service relocation process. We also introduce 21 different relocation
policies, which use three types of data for decision making - network
topological characteristics, rejection history and traffic prediction.
Eventually, we perform extensive numerical experiments in order to: (i) tune
proposed optimization approaches and (ii) evaluate and compare their efficiency
and select the best one. The results of the investigation prove high efficiency
of the proposed policies. The propoerly designed relocation policy allowed to
allocate up to 3% more traffic (compared to the allocation without that
policy). The results also reveal that the most efficient relocation policy
bases its decisions on two types of data simultaneously - the rejection history
and traffic prediction.

address the issue that edges in dependency trees should be constructed at the
text span/subtree level rather than word level. In this paper, we propose a new
method for dependency parsing to address this issue. The proposed method
constructs dependency trees by directly modeling span-span (in other words,
subtree-subtree) relations. It consists of two modules: the {\it text span
proposal module} which proposes candidate text spans, each of which represents
a subtree in the dependency tree denoted by (root, start, end); and the {\it
span linking module}, which constructs links between proposed spans. We use the
machine reading comprehension (MRC) framework as the backbone to formalize the
span linking module, where one span is used as a query to extract the text
span/subtree it should be linked to. The proposed method has the following
merits: (1) it addresses the fundamental problem that edges in a dependency
tree should be constructed between subtrees; (2) the MRC framework allows the
method to retrieve missing spans in the span proposal stage, which leads to
higher recall for eligible spans. Extensive experiments on the PTB, CTB and
Universal Dependencies (UD) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. The code is available at

do not show explicit features, the prediction performance of these techniques
is poor. Therefore, many machine learning and deep learning models have been
proposed for promoter prediction. In this work, we studied methods for vector
encoding and promoter classification using genome sequences of three distinct
higher eukaryotes viz. yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), A. thaliana (plant)
and human (Homo sapiens). We compared one-hot vector encoding method with
frequency-based tokenization (FBT) for data pre-processing on 1-D Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model. We found that FBT gives a shorter input dimension
reducing the training time without affecting the sensitivity and specificity of
classification. We employed the deep learning techniques, mainly CNN and
recurrent neural network with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and random forest
(RF) classifier for promoter classification at k-mer sizes of 2, 4 and 8. We
found CNN to be superior in classification of promoters from non-promoter

this work lies in the use of synthetic shuffled negative dataset and
frequency-based tokenization for pre-processing. This study provides a

  Unfortunately, reasoning about code written against this interface is
non-trivial: the number of addresses is unbounded, and establishing global

especially for audiovisual learning, has drawn considerable attention recently,
which can boost the performance of various computer vision tasks. However, in
video summarization, existing approaches just exploit the visual information
while neglect the audio information. In this paper, we argue that the audio
modality can assist vision modality to better understand the video content and
structure, and further benefit the summarization process. Motivated by this, we
propose to jointly exploit the audio and visual information for the video
summarization task, and develop an AudioVisual Recurrent Network (AVRN) to
achieve this. Specifically, the proposed AVRN can be separated into three
parts: 1) the two-stream LSTM is utilized to encode the audio and visual
feature sequentially by capturing their temporal dependency. 2) the audiovisual
fusion LSTM is employed to fuse the two modalities by exploring the latent
consistency between them. 3) the self-attention video encoder is adopted to
capture the global dependency in the video. Finally, the fused audiovisual
information, and the integrated temporal and global dependencies are jointly
used to predict the video summary. Practically, the experimental results on the
two benchmarks, \emph{i.e.,} SumMe and TVsum, have demonstrated the
effectiveness of each part, and the superiority of AVRN compared to those
approaches just exploiting visual information for video summarization.

it is natural to incorporate these uncertainties into a robust design. In
contrast to most state-of-the-art approaches that consider worst-case

recently proposed algorithm for linear quadratic control synthesis, which we
extend by giving probabilistic robustness guarantees in the form of credibility

codes, which include several existing coding schemes studied in literature for
line networks as special cases. A batched code has an outer code and an inner
code. The outer code encodes the information messages into batches, each of
which is a group of coded symbols, while the inner code performs recoding on
the symbols belonging to the same batch at all nodes that forwarding a batch.
Batched codes enable us to impose various block-length and buffer size
constraints by tuning coding parameters. Using a technique that captures the
communication bottleneck of line networks, we derive upper bounds on the
achievable rates of batched codes as functions of line network length for
several coding parameter sets. We also discuss specific recoding schemes that
can achieve rates of the same order of the line network length for these coding
parameter sets. Our results shed light on how to design large multi-hop network
communications in practical scenarios using a unified coding framework instead

quality. In recent years, although the interpolation performance has achieved
great success, image blur usually occurs at the object boundaries owing to the
large motion. It has been a long-standing problem, and has not been addressed
yet. In this paper, we propose to reduce the image blur and get the clear shape
of objects by preserving the edges in the interpolated frames. To this end, the
proposed Edge-Aware Network (EA-Net) integrates the edge information into the
frame interpolation task. It follows an end-to-end architecture and can be
separated into two stages, \emph{i.e.}, edge-guided flow estimation and
edge-protected frame synthesis. Specifically, in the flow estimation stage,
three edge-aware mechanisms are developed to emphasize the frame edges in
estimating flow maps, so that the edge-maps are taken as the auxiliary
information to provide more guidance to boost the flow accuracy. In the frame
synthesis stage, the flow refinement module is designed to refine the flow map,
and the attention module is carried out to adaptively focus on the
bidirectional flow maps when synthesizing the intermediate frames. Furthermore,
the frame and edge discriminators are adopted to conduct the adversarial
training strategy, so as to enhance the reality and clarity of synthesized
frames. Experiments on three benchmarks, including Vimeo90k, UCF101 for

contracting systems is that many interconnections of contracting sub-systems
yield an overall contracting system.
  A generalization of contracting systems is $k$-contracting systems, where
$k\in\{1,\dots,n\}$. The flow of such systems contracts the volume of
$k$-dimensional parallelotopes at an exponential rate, and in particular they
reduce to contracting systems when $k=1$. It was shown by Muldowney and Li that

  Here, we derive a sufficient condition guaranteeing that the system obtained
from the series interconnection of two sub-systems is $k$-contracting. This is
based on a new formula for the $k$th multiplicative and additive compounds of a

It is denoted as open problem $41$ in the website ""Open quantum problems-IQOQI

by MEO using Ce(IV) ionic mediator. Furthermore, we also observed the influence
of addition Ag(I) ion catalyst in MEO for degradation of MB. The
electro-degradation of MB was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry technique and was
confirmed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis and back-titration analysis. The results showed that in the
absence of Ag(I) ion catalyst, about 89 % of MB was decolorized within 30
minutes. When 2 mM of Ag(I) ion catalyst was applied, the electro-degradation
of MB was increased to maximum value of 100%. The UV-Vis spectrum confirmed the
electro-degradation of MB as suggested by decreased maximum absorbance value at
{\lambda} 668 nm from 2.125 to 0.059. The HPLC analysis showed the formation of
five new peaks at retention time of 1.331, 1.495, 1.757, 1.908 and 2.017

showed about 52.9% of CO2 was produced during electro-degradation of MB by MEO.
More importantly, more than 97% of Ce(IV) ionic mediator were recovered in our
investigation. Our results reveal the potential of MEO using Ce(IV) ionic
mediator to improve the wastewater runs-off quality from textile as well as

have a different start of follow up, e.g. when treatment is started later in
the disease trajectory. When the follow up period of control patients starts
earlier in the disease trajectory than follow up of the treated, estimation of
the treatment effect suffers from different types of survival/survivorship
bias. We study unobserved heterogeneity and illustrate how failing to account
for the time difference in recruitment between treated and controls leads to
bias in the estimated treatment effect. We explore five methods to adjust for
this survivorship bias by including the time between diagnosis and treatment
initiation (wait time) in the analysis in different ways. We first conducted a
simulation study on whether these methods reduce survivorship bias, then
applied our methods to fertility data on insemination. The five methods were:
first, to regress on wait time as an additional covariate in the analysis
model. Second, to match on wait time. Third, to select treated who started
treatment immediately. Fourth, to select controls who survived up to the median
time of treatment initiation. Fifth, to consider the wait time as the time of
left truncation. All methods reduced survivorship bias in the simulation. In
the application to fertility data, failing to adjust for survivorship bias led
to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.63 (95%CI: 1.13-1.65) whereas a HR of 2.15
(1.71-2.69) was expected when using a time-varying covariate for treatment,
which in this prospective cohort coincided with the left truncation approach.
In agreement with our simulations, the method in which adjustment corrected the
HR upwards the most was left truncation. We conclude that the wait time between
diagnosis and treatment initiation should be taken into account in the analysis
to respect the chronology of the disease and treatment trajectory.

CsPbBr$_3$. Our calculations indicate that surfaces might facilitate bromine
vacancy migration in these perovskites, due to their soft structure that allows
for bond lengths variations larger than in the bulk. We calculate the migration
energy for axial-to-axial bromine vacancy migration at the surface to be only
half of the value in the bulk. Furthermore, we study the effect of modifying
the surface with four different alkali halide monolayers, finding an increase
of the migration barrier to almost the bulk value for the NaCl-passivated
system. Migration barriers are found to be correlated to the lattice mismatch
between the CsPbBr$_3$ surface and the alkali halide monolayer. Our
calculations suggest that surfaces might play a significant role in mediating
vacancy migration in halide perovskites, a result with relevance for perovskite
nanocrystals with large surface-to-volume ratios. Moreover, we propose viable

  We find that the CO-emitting gas is distributed within a relatively small

strongly disrupted outer regions, which seem to be parts of spiral arms that
are highly focused on the orbital plane. The structure and dynamics of these

the observed nebula is the result of the dynamical interaction between the wind

the hot companion efficiently photodissociates molecules except in the densest
and best-shielded regions, that is, in the close surroundings of the AGB star
and some shreds of the spiral arms from which the detected lines come. We can
offer a faithful description of the distribution of nebular gas in this

Fourier-filtering wavefront sensor (FFWFS). The ZWFS is known for its extremely
high sensitivity while having a low dynamic range, which makes it a unique
sensor for second stage adaptive optics (AO) systems or quasi-static
aberrations calibration sensor. This sensor is composed of a focal plane mask
made of a phase shifting dot fully described by two parameters: its diameter
and depth. In this letter, we aim to improve the performance of this sensor by
changing the diameter of its phase shifting dot. We begin with a general
theoretical framework providing an analytical description of the FFWFS
properties, then we predict the expected ZWFS sensitivity for different
configurations of dot diameters and depths. The analytical predictions are then
validated with end-to-end simulations. From this, we propose a variation of the
classical ZWFS shape which exhibits extremely appealing properties. We show
that the ZWFS sensitivity can be optimized by modifying the dot diameter and
even reach the optimal theoretical limit, with a trade-off for low spatial
frequencies sensitivity. As an example, we show that a ZWFS with a 2{\lambda}/D
dot diameter (where {\lambda} is the sensing wavelength and D the telescope
diameter), hereafter called Z2WFS, exhibits a sensitivity twice higher than the
classical 1.06{\lambda}/D ZWFS for all the phase spatial components except for
tip-tilt modes. Furthermore, this gain in sensitivity does not impact the
dynamic range of the sensor, and the Z2WFS exhibits a similar dynamical range
as the classical 1.06{\lambda}/D ZWFS. This study opens the path to the
conception of diameter-optimized ZWFS.

reasoning: given a claim with associated evidence, the models aim to estimate
the claim veracity based on the supporting or refuting content within the
evidence. When these models perform well, it is generally assumed to be due to
the models having learned to reason over the evidence with regards to the
claim. In this paper, we investigate this assumption of reasoning, by exploring
the relationship and importance of both claim and evidence. Surprisingly, we
find on political fact checking datasets that most often the highest
effectiveness is obtained by utilizing only the evidence, as the impact of
including the claim is either negligible or harmful to the effectiveness. This
highlights an important problem in what constitutes evidence in existing
approaches for automatic fake news detection.

the impact of these algorithms on daily life and society, little is known about
their effect on information transfer and opinion formation. It is thus unclear
to what extent algorithmic bias has a harmful influence on collective
decision-making, such as a tendency to polarize debate. Here we introduce a
general theoretical framework to systematically link models of opinion

flexibility of our framework by exploring a family of binary-state opinion

group interactions. All models show an opinion polarization regime driven by
algorithmic bias and modular network structure. The role of content filtering
is, however, surprisingly nuanced; for pairwise interactions it leads to
polarization, while for group interactions it promotes coexistence of opinions.
This allows us to pinpoint which social interactions are robust against
algorithmic bias, and which ones are susceptible to bias-enhanced opinion
polarization. Our framework gives theoretical ground for the development of
heuristics to tackle harmful effects of online bias, such as information
bottlenecks, echo chambers, and opinion radicalization.

observationally, turbulent effects can be directly studied using global
convective dynamo (GCD) simulations. We measure the turbulent effects in terms
of turbulent transport coefficients, based on the MF framework, from an
exemplary GCD simulation using the test-field method. These coefficients are
then used as an input into an MF model. We find a good agreement between the MF

requires all turbulent effects to be included, even those which have been
regarded as unimportant so far. Our results suggest that simple dynamo models,
as are commonly used in the solar and stellar community, relying on very few,
precisely fine-tuned turbulent effects, may not be representative of the full
dynamics of dynamos in global convective simulations and astronomical objects.

developed from the local-chain and public chain, respectively. The proposed
scheme ensures D2D authentication by the Hash-MAC-DSDV mutual scheme, where the
MAC addresses of individual devices are registered in the first phase and
advertised in the network in the second phase. The proposed scheme allows
legitimate devices to modify their routing table and unicast the one-way hash

(MR) images is essential in brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. However, due
to the existence of domain shifts among different modalities, the performance
of networks decreases dramatically when training on one modality and performing
on another, e.g., train on T1 image while performing on T2 image, which is
often required in clinical applications. This also prohibits a network from
being trained on labeled data and then transferred to unlabeled data from a
different domain. To overcome this, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
methods provide effective solutions to alleviate the domain shift between
labeled source data and unlabeled target data. In this paper, we propose a
novel Bidirectional Global-to-Local (BiGL) adaptation framework under a UDA
scheme. Specifically, a bidirectional image synthesis and segmentation module
is proposed to segment the brain tumor using the intermediate data
distributions generated for the two domains, which includes an image-to-image
translator and a shared-weighted segmentation network. Further, a
global-to-local consistency learning module is proposed to build robust
representation alignments in an integrated way. Extensive experiments on a
multi-modal brain MR benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods by
a large margin, while a comprehensive ablation study validates the
effectiveness of each key component. The implementation code of our method will

resides in the centre of the galaxy cluster Abell 569. For this study, we have
used archival data from the Very Large Array (VLA) at various resolutions and
frequencies, as well as the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). While the
wide-angle tailed (WAT) Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) radio morphology of the
source has been discussed widely in the literature, the nature of the inner
lobes has not been as widely discussed. In particular, we note that the inner
lobes resemble the bubble-like radio structures observed in Seyfert galaxies.
Polarization-sensitive data from the VLA clearly show magnetic field structures
consistent with FR Is for the outer lobes and Seyferts for the inner lobes in
NGC 2329. FR Is are classified as radio-loud (RL) active galactic nuclei (AGN)
and Seyferts as radio-quiet (RQ) AGN, making this source unique. The VLBA shows
a one-sided radio jet suggesting a relativistic pc-scale outflow, leading into
the inner lobes. Electron lifetime estimates suggest that the outer FR I-like
lobes are nearly twice as old ($\sim$45 Myr) as the inner Seyfert-like lobes
($\sim$25 Myr). Gas inflow in this merging cluster seems to have rejuvenated
the AGN about $\sim$25 Myr ago, and may have caused a change in the accretion
disc state. The complex composite radio morphology of NGC 2329 suggests that
the RL/RQ dichotomy is a function of time in the lifecycle of an AGN.

There is still an ongoing debate on whether the main cause of the tsunami waves
observed was a significant co-seismic tectonic event which occurred underwater
or whether it were the multiple landslides detected along the coast and
triggered by the earthquake. Data from the paper by Liu et al. (2020) in which
the bathymetry of the bay was analysed suggests that landslide-induced waves
may have contributed significantly to the tsunami. However, the data presented
was incomplete and the information regarding the starting time, magnitude of
these waves and the coastal landslide progression has significant
uncertainties. In this paper we model each landslide-generated wave with the
COMCOT model and track the propagation of the waves to understand their
individual contribution at several relevant locations inside the bay where free
surface elevation data is available. We then explore the feasible scenarios
(i.e. landslide-generated wave configurations and timings) that produce tsunami
waves as close as those observed using an optimization technique based on
genetic algorithms. Numerical simulations of the chosen scenario point out that
landslide-generated waves are likely the main contributors to the tsunami, as
they can arrive very fast, at the precise timing, to the locations of interest
and can trigger the natural resonant modes of the bay, producing long-period
waves that were also observed.

biclosed category, where all rules emerge as currying/uncurrying the identity;

arbitrary real-valued, multivariate, and continuous function into a two-layer
nested superposition of a finite number of functions. The functions at these
two layers, are referred to as the inner and outer functions with the key
property that the design of the inner functions is independent of that of the
original function of interest to be computed. This brings modularity and
universality to the design of the inner function, and subsequently, a part of
computation. This paper capitalizes on such modularity and universality in
functional representation to propose two frameworks for distributed computation
over the additive multiple access channels (MACs). In the first framework, each
source encodes the inner representations and sends them over the additive MAC.
Subsequently, the receiver computes the outer functions to compute the function
of interest. Transmitting the values of the inner functions instead of the
messages directly leads to compression gains. In the second approach, in order
to further increase the compression rate, the framework aims to also bring
computing the outer functions to the source sites. Specifically, each source
employs a graph-coloring-based approach to perform joint functional compression
of the inner and the outer functions, which may attain further compression
savings over the former. These modular encoding schemes provide an exact
representation in the asymptotic regime and the non-asymptotic regime.
Contrasting these with the baseline model where sources directly transmit data
over MAC, we observe gains. To showcase the gains of these two frameworks and
their discrepancies, they are applied to a number of commonly used computations
in distributed systems, e.g., computing products, $\ell_m$-norms, polynomial
functions, extremum values of functions, and affine transformations.

these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology that is able to model

linear systems $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$. Basically, the algorithm replaces
orthogonal projections with reflections in the original scheme of Stefan
Kaczmarz. Building on this, we give a geometric description of solutions of
linear systems. Suppose $A$ is $m\times n$, we show that the algorithm
generates a series of points distributed with patterns on an $(n-1)$-sphere
centered on a solution. These points lie evenly on $2m$ lower-dimensional
spheres $\{\S_{k0},\S_{k1}\}_{k=1}^m$, with the property that for any $k$, the
midpoint of the centers of $\S_{k0},\S_{k1}$ is exactly a solution of
$A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$. With this discovery, we prove that taking the average
of $O(\eta(A)\log(1/\varepsilon))$ points on any $\S_{k0}\cup\S_{k1}$
effectively approximates a solution up to relative error $\varepsilon$, where
$\eta(A)$ characterizes the eigengap of the orthogonal matrix produced by the
product of $m$ reflections generated by the rows of $A$. We also analyze the
connection between $\eta(A)$ and $\kappa(A)$, the condition number of $A$. In
the worst case $\eta(A)=O(\kappa^2(A)\log m)$, while for random matrices
$\eta(A)=O(\kappa(A))$ on average. Finally, we prove that the algorithm indeed
solves the linear system $A^T W^{-1}A \mathbf{x} = A^T W^{-1} \mathbf{b}$,
where $W$ is the lower-triangular matrix such that $W+W^T = 2AA^T$. The
connection between this linear system and the original one is studied. The
numerical tests indicate that this new Kaczmarz algorithm has comparable
performance to randomized (block) Kaczmarz algorithms.

steep-enough scaling angle, the PML solution is exponentially close, both in
frequency and the tangent of the scaling angle, to the true scattering
solution. Moreover, for a fixed scaling angle and large enough PML width, the
PML solution is exponentially close to the true scattering solution in both
frequency and the PML width. In fact, the exponential bound holds with rate of
decay $c(w\tan\theta -C) k$ where $w$ is the PML width and $\theta$ is the
scaling angle. More generally, the results of the paper hold in the framework
of black-box scattering under the assumption of an exponential bound on the
norm of the cutoff resolvent, thus including problems with strong trapping.
These are the first results on the exponential accuracy of PML at
high-frequency with non-trivial scatterers.

the mobile impurity is surrounded by a bath that undergoes a

finite temperature. We have studied the effect of temperature on a Bose polaron
system performing ab-initio Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations. This method
is able to approach the critical temperature without losing accuracy, in
contrast with perturbative approximations. We have calculated the polaron
energy for the repulsive and attractive branches and we have observed an
asymmetric behavior between the two branches. When the potential is repulsive,
the polaron energy decreases when the temperature increases, and contrariwise
for the attractive branch. Our results for the effective mass and the dynamical
structure factor of the polaron show unambiguously that its quasiparticle
nature disappears close to the critical temperature, in agreement with recent
experimental findings. Finally, we have also estimated the fraction of bosons
in the condensate as well as the superfluid fraction, and we have concluded
that the impurity hinders the condensation of the rest of bosons.

requirements of real-time systems in industrial applications, where the system
runs tasks with different criticality levels on a single platform. In some
workloads, a high-critically task might overrun and overload the system, or a
fault can occur during the execution. However, these systems must be
fault-tolerant and guarantee the correct execution of all high-criticality
tasks by their deadlines to avoid catastrophic consequences, in any situation.
Furthermore, in these MC systems, the peak power consumption of the system may
increase, especially in an overload situation and exceed the processor Thermal
Design Power (TDP) constraint. This may cause generating heat beyond the
cooling capacity, resulting the system stop to avoid excessive heat and halting
the processor. In this paper, we propose a technique for dependent
dual-criticality tasks in fault-tolerant multi-core MC systems to manage peak
power consumption and temperature. The technique develops a tree of possible
task mapping and scheduling at design-time to cover all possible scenarios and
reduce the low-criticality task drop rate in the high-criticality mode. At
run-time, the system exploits the tree to select a proper schedule according to
fault occurrences and criticality mode changes. Experimental results show that
the average task schedulability is 74.14% on average for the proposed method,
while the peak power consumption and maximum temperature are improved by 16.65%

for a real-life application, our method reduces the peak power and maximum
temperature by up to 20.06% and 5 C, respectively, compared to a
state-of-the-art approach.

procedure aims to minimize the root-mean-square value of the input torque by
optimizing the mechanism's mass distribution. In this context, we show that a
perfect matching with the desired trajectory can be reached by assuming the
ability to design an arbitrary shape of the system's elastic properties. Then,
in order to favor a simpler physical implementation of the structure, we
dedicate the second optimization step to the piecewise linear approximation of

finally tested in detailed numerical simulations, confirming its effectiveness
in generating a complex and efficient periodic motion.

motion consistency to force the smoothness among neighboring points. In
addition, constraints on the rigidity of the local transformation are also
added by sharing unique rigid motion parameters for all points within each

is deployed to explore both point-wise smoothness and region-wise rigidity. To
empower the CRFs to have a discriminative unary term, we also introduce a

Generic Itemset Mining based on Reinforcement Learning (GIM-RL), that offers a
unified framework to train an agent for extracting any type of itemsets. In
GIM-RL, the environment formulates iterative steps of extracting a target type
of itemsets from a dataset. At each step, an agent performs an action to add or
remove an item to or from the current itemset, and then obtains from the
environment a reward that represents how relevant the itemset resulting from
the action is to the target type. Through numerous trial-and-error steps where
various rewards are obtained by diverse actions, the agent is trained to
maximise cumulative rewards so that it acquires the optimal action policy for
forming as many itemsets of the target type as possible. In this framework, an
agent for extracting any type of itemsets can be trained as long as a reward
suitable for the type can be defined. The extensive experiments on mining high
utility itemsets, frequent itemsets and association rules show the general
effectiveness and one remarkable potential (agent transfer) of GIM-RL. We hope

research interest, which broaden the classification of topological phases and
provide a valuable platform to explore topological superconductivity. Here, we
report the discovery of superconductivity and topological features in
Pb-intercalated transition-metal dichalcogenide Pb$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$. Systematic
measurements indicate that Pb$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ is a quasi-two-dimensional (q-2D)
type-II superconductor ({\em T}$_c \approx$ 2.8 K) with a significantly
enhanced anisotropy of upper critical field ($\gamma_{H_{c2}}$ =
$H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c}$ $\approx$ 17). In addition, first-principles
calculations reveal that Pb$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ hosts multiple topological Dirac
fermions in the electronic band structure. We discover four groups of Dirac
nodal lines on the $k_z = \pi$ plane and two sets of Dirac points on the
rotation/screw axes, which are protected by crystalline symmetries and robust
against spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Dirac-cone-like surface states emerge on the
(001) surface because of band inversion. Our work shows that the TCM candidate
Pb$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ is a promising arena to study the interplay between
superconductivity and topological Dirac fermions.

provide the foundation for the creation of a high throughput automated platform

the system through a design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle. However, mainstream
machine learning techniques represented by deep learning lacks the capability
to represent relational knowledge and requires prodigious amounts of annotated
training data. These drawbacks strongly restrict AI's role in synthetic biology
in which experimentation is inherently resource and time intensive. In this
work, we propose an automated biodesign engineering framework empowered by
Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning ($Meta_{Abd}$), a novel machine learning
approach that combines symbolic and sub-symbolic machine learning, to further
enhance the DBTL cycle by enabling the learning machine to 1) exploit domain
knowledge and learn human-interpretable models that are expressed by formal
languages such as first-order logic; 2) simultaneously optimise the structure
and parameters of the models to make accurate numerical predictions; 3) reduce
the cost of experiments and effort on data annotation by actively generating
hypotheses and examples. To verify the effectiveness of $Meta_{Abd}$, we have
modelled a synthetic dataset for the production of proteins from a three gene
operon in a microbial host, which represents a common synthetic biology
problem.

$SU(5)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y} \rightarrow U(1)_{em}$, due to a particular Higgs
sector consisting of five scalar quintuplets. Each scalar quintuplet acquires
its own vacuum expectation value, by means of a proper parametrization which is
worked out once the overall vacuum expectation value in the model is
established. The decoupling of the low energy regime (corresponding to the
Standard Model) from the high scale (required by out model here) is
straightforwardly achieved in order to preserve the consistency with the
present experimental data. Finally, a promising phenomenological outcome is
derived by simply tuning a single free parameter. Our results include, besides
a viable one-parameter mass spectrum, also the prediction of precisely three

is considered, which uses a model consisting of a Taylor expansion of arbitrary

shown that the non-smoothness of the norm does not affect the
$O(\epsilon_1^{-(p+1)/p})$ upper bound on evaluation complexity for finding
first-order $\epsilon_1$-approximate minimizers using $p$ derivatives, and that
this result does not hinge on the equivalence of norms in $\Re^n$. It is also
shown that, if $p=2$, the bound of $O(\epsilon_2^{-3})$ evaluations for finding
second-order $\epsilon_2$-approximate minimizers still holds for a variant of
AR1pGN named AR2GN, despite the possibly non-smooth nature of the
regularization term. Moreover, the adaptation of the existing theory for
handling the non-smoothness results in an interesting modification of the
subproblem termination rules, leading to an even more compact complexity
analysis. In particular, it is shown when the Newton's step is acceptable for
an adaptive regularization method. The approximate minimization of quadratic
polynomials regularized with non-smooth norms is then discussed, and a new
approximate second-order necessary optimality condition is derived for this

second-order conditions that are strong enough to ensure the existence of a
suitable step in AR1pGN (when $p=2$) and in AR2GN, and its iteration complexity

is exposed (provided) to a user. Most of the existing approaches use heuristic
models or re-weighting strategy on observed ratings to mimic the

effect of mesonic enhancement $\epsilon _{\mathrm{mec}}=2.01\pm 0.05$ in the
rank-0 for the axial-charge matrix element $\gamma _{5}$. Here, we have
calculated the $\log ft$ values from the ground-state of $^{207}$Hg to the
several excited states of $^{207}$Tl and obtained a good agreement between the
calculated and the experimental data. In the experimental data spin and parity

behave on modern CPUs are governed by the design and organization of these. The
vectorization units (SIMD) are among the few CPUs' parts that can and must be
explicitly controlled. In the HPC community, the x86 CPUs and their
vectorization instruction sets were de-facto the standard for decades. Each new
release of an instruction set was usually a doubling of the vector length
coupled with new operations. Each generation was pushing for adapting and
improving previous implementations. The release of the ARM scalable vector
extension (SVE) changed things radically for several reasons. First, we expect
ARM processors to equip many supercomputers in the next years. Second, SVE's
interface is different in several aspects from the x86 extensions as it
provides different instructions, uses a predicate to control most operations,
and has a vector size that is only known at execution time. Therefore, using
SVE opens new challenges on how to adapt algorithms including the ones that are
already well-optimized on x86. In this paper, we port a hybrid sort based on
the well-known Quicksort and Bitonic-sort algorithms. We use a Bitonic sort to
process small partitions/arrays and a vectorized partitioning implementation to
divide the partitions. We explain how we use the predicates and how we manage
the non-static vector size. We explain how we efficiently implement the sorting
kernels. Our approach only needs an array of O(log N) for the recursive calls
in the partitioning phase, both in the sequential and in the parallel case. We
test the performance of our approach on a modern ARMv8.2 and assess the
different layers of our implementation by sorting/partitioning integers, double
floating-point numbers, and key/value pairs of integers. Our approach is faster
than the GNU C++ sort algorithm by a speedup factor of 4 on average.

fractional bandwidth of 56%, and then each frequency band is further divided
into two bands by each diplexer. The developed multiplexers were designed,
fabricated, and characterized using a vector network analyzer. The measurement
results showed good agreement with the simulation. The receiver noise
temperature was measured by connecting the SIS-mixers, one of which has a

NSOP$_1$, which is more general than being simple. In NSOP$_1$ theories forking
independence may not be as well-behaved as in stable or simple theories, so it
is replaced by another independence notion, called Kim-independence. We
generalise Kim-independence over models in NSOP$_1$ theories to positive logic
-- a proper generalisation of first-order logic where negation is not built in,
but can be added as desired. For example, an important application is that we
can add hyperimaginary sorts to a positive theory to get another positive
theory, preserving NSOP$_1$ and various other properties. We prove that, in a
thick positive NSOP$_1$ theory, Kim-independence over existentially closed
models has all the nice properties that it is known to have in a first-order
NSOP$_1$ theory. We also provide a Kim-Pillay style theorem, characterising
which thick positive theories are NSOP$_1$ by the existence of a certain
independence relation. Furthermore, this independence relation must then be the
same as Kim-independence. Thickness is the mild assumption that being an
indiscernible sequence is type-definable.
  In first-order logic Kim-independence is defined in terms of Morley sequences
in global invariant types. These may not exist in thick positive theories. We
solve this by working with Morley sequences in global Lascar-invariant types,
which do exist in thick positive theories. We also simplify certain tree
constructions that were used in the study of Kim-independence in first-order
theories. In particular, we only work with trees of finite height.

parameter describing the time-dependent, frequency-filtered wave power. A well
defined inertial range with power-law scaling has been found almost everywhere.
However, the Kolmogorov scaling and the typical intermittency effects are only
present in part of the samples. Other intervals have shallower spectra and more
irregular intermittency, not described by models of turbulence. These are
observed predominantly during intervals of enhanced ion frequency wave
activity. Comparisons with compressible magnetic field intermittency (from the

to transform data obtained from quantum hardware with artificially increased
Trotter steps number (noise level) towards the data obtained without such an
increase. The additional Trotter steps are fictitious, i.e., they contain
negligibly small rotations and, in the absence of hardware imperfections,
reduce essentially to the identity gates. This preserves, at the training
stage, information about relevant quantum circuit features. Two particular
examples are considered that are the dynamics of the transverse-field Ising

drugs (YDs) have proven particularly effective in this respect, producing
subjective phenomenology which reliably elicits intense STEs. With virtual

environments, we describe a VR framework called 'Isness-distributed' (Isness-D)
which harnesses the unique affordances of distributed multi-person VR to blur
conventional self-other boundaries. Within Isness-D, groups of participants
co-habit a shared virtual space, collectively experiencing their bodies as
luminous energetic essences with diffuse spatial boundaries. It enables moments
of 'energetic coalescence', a new class of embodied phenomenological
intersubjective experience where bodies can fluidly merge, enabling
participants to have an experience of including multiple others within their
self-representation. To evaluate Isness-D, we adopted a citizen science
approach, coordinating an international network of Isness-D 'nodes'. We
analyzed the results (N = 58) using 4 different self-report scales previously
applied to analyze subjective YD phenomenology (the inclusion of community in
self scale, ego-dissolution inventory, communitas scale, and the MEQ30 mystical
experience questionnaire). Despite the complexities associated with a
distributed experiment like this, the Isness-D scores on all 4 scales were
statistically indistinguishable from recently published YD studies,
demonstrating that distributed VR can be used to design intersubjective STEs

amount of collected metadata, anatomical information from these images has the
potential for medical analyses at unprecedented scale. However, their
evaluation often requires manual input and long processing times, limiting the
amount of reference values for biomarkers and other measurements available for
research. Recent approaches with convolutional neural networks for regression
can perform these evaluations automatically. On magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) data of more than 40,000 UK Biobank subjects, these systems can estimate
human age, body composition and more. This style of analysis is almost entirely
data-driven and no manual intervention or guidance with manually segmented
ground truth images is required. The networks often closely emulate the
reference method that provided their training data and can reach levels of
agreement comparable to the expected variability between established medical
gold standard techniques. The risk of silent failure can be individually
quantified by predictive uncertainty obtained from a mean-variance criterion
and ensembling. Saliency analysis furthermore enables an interpretation of the
underlying relevant image features and showed that the networks learned to
correctly target specific organs, limbs, and regions of interest.

geometry for securing a good thermal stability factor from the shape anisotropy
of the nanomagnet. Such a concept is particularly well-suited for small
junctions down to a few nanometers. At such a volume size, the nanopillar can
be effectively modeled as a Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) particle, and the shape
anisotropy scales with the spontaneous magnetization by ~ Ms^2. For almost all
ferromagnets, Ms is a strong function of temperature, therefore, the
temperature-dependent shape anisotropy is an important factor to be considered
in any modeling of the temperature-dependent performance of PSA-STT-MRAMs. In
this work, we summarize and discuss various possible temperature-dependent
contributions to the thermal stability factor and coercivity of the
PSA-STT-MRAMs by modeling and comparing different temperature scaling and
parameters. We reveal nontrivial corrections to the thermal stability factor by
considering both temperature-dependent shape and interfacial anisotropies. The
coercivity, blocking temperature, and electrical switching characteristics that
resulted from incorporating such a temperature dependence are also discussed,

both experimental techniques and the theoretical many-body results, supporting
also the picture of a phonon-mediated mechanism where indirect transitions are

microfluidic separation device based on a cell-free layer concept. Using this
high-speed imaging set-up, we quantified the cell-free zone width fluctuations
at bifurcations. We demonstrated that these fluctuations have the same
frequency and amplitude than the syringe pump induced pressure oscillations.
Finally, to illustrate that pressure fluctuations degrade the separation
efficiency in such devices, we demonstrate using milk samples, instances of
particles diverted to undesired outlets. This work provides an insight into the
effect of syringe pump fluctuations on microfluidic separation, which will
inform the design of microfluidic systems and improve their resilience to
pulsating or fluctuating flow conditions.

machine learning systems. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using
gradient compression to reduce the communication overhead of the distributed
training. However, there is little understanding of applying gradient
compression to adaptive gradient methods. Moreover, its performance benefits
are often limited by the non-negligible compression overhead. In this paper, we
first introduce a novel adaptive gradient method with gradient compression. We
show that the proposed method has a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ for non-convex problems. In addition, we develop a
scalable system called BytePS-Compress for two-way compression, where the
gradients are compressed in both directions between workers and parameter
servers. BytePS-Compress pipelines the compression and decompression on CPUs
and achieves a high degree of parallelism. Empirical evaluations show that we
improve the training time of ResNet50, VGG16, and BERT-base by 5.0%, 58.1%,
23.3%, respectively, without any accuracy loss with 25 Gb/s networking.
Furthermore, for training the BERT models, we achieve a compression rate of
333x compared to the mixed-precision training.

experimentally observe improvements in both tasks' performance because the

improve both semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks performance in

producing T-even and T-odd gluon transverse momentum distributions (TMDs), at
leading twist. We propose an expansion of the gluon correlator, using a basis
of four tensors (one antisymmetric and three symmetric), which are expressed
through generators of the $U(2)$ group acting in the two-dimensional transverse
plane. One can do clear interpretations of the two transversity T-odd TMDs with
linear polarization of gluons: symmetric and asymmetric under permutation of
the transverse spin of the nucleon and the transverse momentum of the gluon.
Using light-front wave function (LFWF) representation, we also derive T-even
and T-odd gluon TMDs in the nucleon at leading twist. The gluon-three-quark
Fock component in the nucleon is considered as bound state of gluon and
three-quark core (spectator). The TMDs are constructed as factorized product of
two LFWFs and gluonic matrix encoding information about both T-even and T-odd
TMDs. In particular, T-odd TMDs arise due to gluon rescattering between the
gluon and three-quark spectator. Gluon rescattering effects are parametrized by
unknown scalar functions depending on the $x$ and ${\bf k}_{\perp}$ variables.
Our gluon TDMs obey the model-independent Mulders-Rodrigues inequalities. We
also derive new sum rules (SRs) involving T-even TMDs. One of the SRs states
that the square of the unpolarized TMD is equal to a sum of the squares of
three polarized TMDs. Based on the SR derived for T-even gluon TMDs, we make a
conjecture that there should two additional SRs involving T-odd gluon TMDs,
valid at orders $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha_s^2$. Then, we check these SRs at small
and large values of $x$. We think that our study could serve as useful input

Using a hydrodynamic model we now show that such dense active suspensions
manifest super-diffusion, via L\'evy walks, which masquerades as a crossover
from ballistic to diffusive scaling in measurements of
mean-squared-displacements, and is tied to the emergence of hitherto undetected
oscillatory streaks in the flow. Thus, while laying the theoretical framework
of an emergent advantageous strategy in the collective behaviour of
microorganisms, our study underlines the essential differences between active
and inertial turbulence.

that all tasks have the same input feature space. However, in the real world
scenarios, there are many cases that the input structures of tasks can be
different, that is, different tasks may vary in the number of input modalities
or data types. Existing meta-learners cannot handle the heterogeneous task
distribution (HTD) as there is not only global meta-knowledge shared across
tasks but also type-specific knowledge that distinguishes each type of tasks.
To deal with task heterogeneity and promote fast within-task adaptions for each

model-agnostic meta-learning framework, which can capture both the
type-specific and globally shared knowledge and can achieve the balance between
knowledge customization and generalization. Specifically, we design a
multi-channel backbone module that encodes the input of each type of tasks into
the same length sequence of modality-specific embeddings. Then, we propose a
task-aware iterative feature aggregation network which can automatically take
into account the context of task-specific input structures and adaptively
project the heterogeneous input spaces to the same lower-dimensional embedding

demonstrate that HetMAML successfully leverages type-specific and globally
shared meta-parameters for heterogeneous tasks and achieves fast within-task
adaptions for each type of tasks.

improvements in modelling physical processes described by partial differential
equations (PDEs). PINNs are based on simple architectures, and learn the
behavior of complex physical systems by optimizing the network parameters to
minimize the residual of the underlying PDE. Current network architectures
share some of the limitations of classical numerical discretization schemes
when applied to non-linear differential equations in continuum mechanics. A
paradigmatic example is the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws that
develop highly localized nonlinear shock waves. Learning solutions of PDEs with
dominant hyperbolic character is a challenge for current PINN approaches, which
rely, like most grid-based numerical schemes, on adding artificial dissipation.
Here, we address the fundamental question of which network architectures are
best suited to learn the complex behavior of non-linear PDEs. We focus on
network architecture rather than on residual regularization. Our new
methodology, called Physics-Informed Attention-based Neural Networks, (PIANNs),
is a combination of recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms. The
attention mechanism adapts the behavior of the deep neural network to the
non-linear features of the solution, and break the current limitations of
PINNs. We find that PIANNs effectively capture the shock front in a hyperbolic
model problem, and are capable of providing high-quality solutions inside and
beyond the training set.

we propose a modified kernel herding algorithm whose framework was introduced

show that the convergence speed of the integration error is directly determined

analyze them theoretically, including through convergence analysis. In

real-time recourse actions when uncertainties are exposed, which allows the
propagation of wind power uncertainties to gas and heat systems. Accordingly,
the developed three-stage distributionally robust chance-constrained model is
converted into a computationally tractable single-stage mixed-integer conic

the task as slot-filling, we propose to train seq-to-seq model with Schema
aware Denoising (SeaD), which consists of two denoising objectives that train
model to either recover input or predict output from two novel erosion and
shuffle noises. These denoising objectives acts as the auxiliary tasks for
better modeling the structural data in S2S generation. In addition, we improve
and propose a clause-sensitive execution guided (EG) decoding strategy to
overcome the limitation of EG decoding for generative model. The experiments
show that the proposed method improves the performance of seq-to-seq model in
both schema linking and grammar correctness and establishes new
state-of-the-art on WikiSQL benchmark. The results indicate that the capacity
of vanilla seq-to-seq architecture for text-to-SQL may have been
under-estimated.

technique for understanding the dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Among these, the transverse momentum correlator
$G_{2}\left(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi\right)$ is of particular interest for its
potential sensitivity to the shear viscosity per unit of entropy density
$\eta/s$ of the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions. We use the
UrQMD, AMPT, and EPOS models for Au--Au at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200~GeV and
Pb--Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2760~GeV to investigate the long range
azimuthal dependence of $G_{2}\left(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi\right)$, and
explore its utility to constrain $\eta/s$ based on charged particle
correlations. We find that the three models yield quantitatively distinct
transverse momentum Fourier harmonics coefficients $a^{p_{\rm T}}_{\rm n}$. We
also observe these coefficients exhibit a significant dependence on $\eta/s$ in
the context of the AMPT model. These observations suggest that exhaustive
measurements of the dependence of $G_{2}\left(\Delta\varphi \right)$ with
collision energy, system size, collision centrality, in particular, offer the
potential to distinguish between different theoretical models and their
underlying assumptions. Exhaustive analyses of $G_{2}\left(\Delta\varphi

establishing new constraints for precise extraction of $\eta/s$.

increasingly employed to provide alternative means of communication and control

bring these systems out of the controlled lab environments. Hence, accurately
classifying MI from brain signals, e.g., from electroencephalography (EEG), is
essential to obtain reliable BCI systems. However, MI classification is still a
challenging task, because the signals are characterized by poor SNR, high
intra-subject and cross-subject variability. Deep learning approaches have
started to emerge as valid alternatives to standard machine learning
techniques, e.g., filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP), to extract
subject-independent features and to increase the cross-subject classification
performance of MI BCI systems. In this paper, we first present a review of the
most recent studies using deep learning for MI classification, with particular
attention to their cross-subject performance. Second, we propose DynamicNet, a
Python-based tool for quick and flexible implementations of deep learning

diameters <100 {\mu}m, divergent beams obtained by defocusing to a position
above the LPBF build plate primarily lead to conduction mode melt pools, while
a focused beam leads to transition and keyhole mode melt pools. Conduction mode
melting helps in avoiding keyhole mode defects, resulting in parts with
densities >99.98%. Additionally, an analytical model-guided selection of laser
power and velocity settings for a focused beam help in stabilizing melt pool
and spatter dynamics in the transition melting mode thereby enabling a
potential to obtain density values close to conduction mode densities
(~99.98%). A dimensionless keyhole number (Ke) was derived in this work to
identify distinct regions of conduction (Ke of 0-12), transition (Ke of 12-20),

aspect ratio (ratio of melt pool depth to width) of ~0.4 is observed to be the

very high both peak and average 5D brightness while having moderate RF power

exemplify three regimes of the gun operation: (i) 160 fC electron beams with a
5-nm-scale emittance for UEDs, (ii) 1.6 pC beams with a 20-nm-scale emittance
for table-top FELs and dielectric-based accelerators, and (iii) 16 pC beams
with a 50-nm-scale emittance for inverse Compton sources and other
accelerator-based photon sources. We introduce a simple analytical model for
the formation of the virtual cathode - the onset of the suppression of
photoemission current due to space-charge forces. The model accounts for the
laser pulse duration. Furthermore, our extensive numerical simulations indicate
a well-pronounced maximum in the 5D beam brightness for the laser spot radius
approximately 150% of that corresponding to the onset of the virtual cathode.
The finding does not support the common approach in the literature that in the

sections at near detectors, but $\nu_e$ cross sections are poorly constrained
and require theoretical inputs. In particular, quantum electrodynamics
radiative corrections are different for electrons and muons. These corrections
are proportional to the small quantum electrodynamics coupling $\alpha \approx
1/137$; however, the large separation of scales between the neutrino energy and
the proton mass ($\sim{\rm GeV}$), and the electron mass and soft-photon
detection thresholds ($\sim{\rm MeV}$) introduces large logarithms in the
perturbative expansion. The resulting flavor differences exceed the
percent-level experimental precision and depend on nonperturbative hadronic
structure. We establish a factorization theorem for exclusive charged-current
(anti)neutrino scattering cross sections representing them as a product of two
factors. The first factor is flavor universal; it depends on hadronic and
nuclear structure and can be constrained by high-statistics $\nu_\mu$ data. The
second factor is non-universal and contains logarithmic enhancements, but can
be calculated exactly in perturbation theory. For charged-current elastic
scattering, we demonstrate the cancellation of uncertainties in the predicted

Results: Our approach allow us to mine QA-AT knowledge effectively with an

extensive applications in many real-world scenarios, such as recommendation
systems, financial transactions, and social networks. Although many works have
been proposed for dynamic graph modeling in recent years, effective and
scalable models are yet to be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel
graph neural network approach, called TCL, which deals with the
dynamically-evolving graph in a continuous-time fashion and enables effective
dynamic node representation learning that captures both the temporal and
topology information. Technically, our model contains three novel aspects.
First, we generalize the vanilla Transformer to temporal graph learning
scenarios and design a graph-topology-aware transformer. Secondly, on top of
the proposed graph transformer, we introduce a two-stream encoder that
separately extracts representations from temporal neighborhoods associated with
the two interaction nodes and then utilizes a co-attentional transformer to
model inter-dependencies at a semantic level. Lastly, we are inspired by the
recently developed contrastive learning and propose to optimize our model by
maximizing mutual information (MI) between the predictive representations of
two future interaction nodes. Benefiting from this, our dynamic representations
can preserve high-level (or global) semantics about interactions and thus is
robust to noisy interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to apply contrastive learning to representation learning on dynamic
graphs. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets for interaction
prediction and experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our model.

compressive strength, and yield strength. Trabecular bone has a reported
porosity range from 70-90%, with trabecular thickness varying from 120-200

models for processing sensory data, discovering hidden patterns, and learning
complex functions, but they struggle to learn such iterative, sequential or

are still prone to data variations, struggle to learn scalable and transferable

abstraction by decoupling algorithmic operations from data manipulations,
realized by splitting the information flow and separated modules. This
abstraction mechanism and evolutionary training enable the learning of robust

First, we study the effect of exchange anisotropy on the Curie temperature
calculated using the Monte-Carlo (MC), the Green's function method, and the
renormalized spin-wave (RNSW). We find that the Green's function overestimates
the Curie temperature in high-anisotropy regimes compared to MC, whereas RNSW
underestimates the Curie temperature compared to the MC and the Green's

temperature of 2D FMs, which provides an estimate of the Curie temperature
greatly improving over the mean-field expression for magnetic material
screening. We apply the closed-form formula to predict the Curie temperature 2D

discrete choice models from data of selections (choices) made by individuals
from a discrete set of alternatives (the choice set). While there are many
models for individual preferences, existing learning methods overlook how
choice set assignment affects the data. Often, the choice set itself is
influenced by an individual's preferences; for instance, a consumer choosing a
product from an online retailer is often presented with options from a
recommender system that depend on information about the consumer's preferences.
Ignoring these assignment mechanisms can mislead choice models into making
biased estimates of preferences, a phenomenon that we call choice set
confounding; we demonstrate the presence of such confounding in widely-used
choice datasets.
  To address this issue, we adapt methods from causal inference to the discrete
choice setting. We use covariates of the chooser for inverse probability
weighting and/or regression controls, accurately recovering individual
preferences in the presence of choice set confounding under certain
assumptions. When such covariates are unavailable or inadequate, we develop
methods that take advantage of structured choice set assignment to improve
prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on real-world
choice data, showing, for example, that accounting for choice set confounding
makes choices observed in hotel booking and commute transportation more
consistent with rational utility-maximization.

computer-aided and segmentation methods of ischemic stroke lesions have been
useful for clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment planning. However, most
of these methods suffer from inaccurate and unreliable segmentation results
because of their inability to capture sufficient contextual features from the

been proposed, which, however, suffer from huge computational requirements. To
mitigate these problems, we propose a novel Dimension Fusion Edge-guided
network (DFENet) that can meet both of these requirements by fusing the
features of 2D and 3D CNNs. Unlike other methods, our proposed network uses a
parallel partial decoder (PPD) module for aggregating and upsampling selected
features, rich in important contextual information. Additionally, we use an
edge-guidance and enhanced mixing loss for constantly supervising and
improvising the learning process of the network. The proposed method is
evaluated on publicly available Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke

show that the accuracy can be improved significantly if the equation is
transformed before discretization, a process we call full operator
preconditioning (FOP). It bears many similarities with traditional
preconditioning for iterative methods but, crucially, transformations are
applied at the operator level. We show that while condition-number improvements
from traditional preconditioning generally do not improve the accuracy of the
solution, FOP can. A number of topics in numerical analysis can be interpreted
as implicitly employing FOP; we highlight (i) Chebyshev interpolation in
polynomial approximation, and (ii) Olver-Townsend's spectral method, both of
which produce solutions of dramatically improved accuracy over a naive problem
formulation. In addition, we propose a FOP preconditioner based on integration
for the solution of fourth-order differential equations with the finite-element

the discretization size, and demonstrate its error-reduction capabilities on
several examples. This work shows that FOP can improve accuracy beyond the

two. We prove the linear stability of the two-jet Kolmogorov type flow for an

Stackelberg game. We present our model's predictions regarding the relation
between contributors' effort (i.e. typical size of edit) and benefits (i.e. the
portion of the article they eventually ``own''). We validate the model's
prediction through an empirical analysis, by studying the interactions of
219,811 distinct contributors that co-produced 864 Wikipedia articles over a
decade. The analysis and empirical results suggest that contributors who make
large edits (``creators'') eventually lose the article's ownership to those who
refine the articles and typically make smaller edits (``curators''). Whereas
neutrality-seeking mechanisms are essential for ensuring that ownership is not

device for enhancing the aerodynamic efficiency and reducing the heat transfer

spike brings in unsteadiness in the form of oscillation and pulsation to the
structure. Previous researchers have investigated the aerothermodynamic
coefficients, together with offering a detailed explanation of the flow physics
and associated unsteadiness, and their dependence on the spike's geometric
characteristics (spike nose, and length-to-fore-body diameter ratio, L/D). This
work focuses on ascertaining the role of flow speeds (free-stream Mach number),
and their energy content, in governing the physics around a spiked body, which
is yet to be established. Numerical investigation has been carried out using
axisymmetric Navier-Stokes laminar flow solver for Mach number range of 2.0 to
7.0. A round-tip spike with flat-face cylindrical after-body have been
simulated for spike length ratio of L/D = 2.0, with spike diameter to fore-body
diameter of 0.1. The flow unsteadiness has been analyzed with drag and pressure
coefficients variation at different Mach numbers. It was found that the flow
field around the spiked blunt nose behaves in pulsation mode at lower Mach
numbers 2, 3 and transition to oscillatory mode at higher Mach numbers 5, 6 and
7, while remain almost stable at Mach 4. The limit of Strouhal Number for
characterizing the pulsation and oscillation modes at various Mach numbers for
spike length of L/D = 2 with flat after-body is observed as 0.2, however it may
very well depend on other geometric parameters of spike and after-body.

  arXiv:2105.07328",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Joint radar and communication (RadCom) systems have been proposed to achieve
the spectrum sharing between radar and communication in recent years. However,
the joint RadCom systems cause the clutter modulation and the performance
degradation of both radar and communication. As a consequence, it's very
critical to improve the performance of both radar and communication when
designing joint RadCom systems. Firstly, this paper designs the constant
modulus dual function waveforms for spatial modulation based joint RadCom
systems. In order to solve the nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem, we
propose a method based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to
obtain a suboptimal solution. Secondly, this paper analyses the effect of
beampattern variation on clutter modulation for spatial modulation based joint
RadCom systems. Besides, this paper considers the design of robust doppler
filter for joint RadCom systems when the receive temporal steering vector is
mismatched to the desired temporal steering vector. This paper aims to maximize
the worst signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) of the doppler filter
in the specific doppler interval under the similarity constraint and constant
white noise gain constraint. In order to solve the nonconvex optimization
problem, we relax the original optimization problem to a semidefinite
programming (SDP), which is convex and can be solved using off-the-shelf
optimization solvers. What's more, the rank-one decomposition method is
utilized to synthesize the weight vector of the proposed robust doppler filter.
Finally, lots of simulation results are presented to show the robustness of the
designed doppler filter.

employed the ray-tracing method to carefully investigate shadows and rings of
the Kehagias-Sfetsos(KS) black hole in deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz(HL)
gravity. The results show that the event horizon $r_+$, the radius $r_p$ and
impact parameter $b_{p}$ of photon sphere are all decreased with the increase
of the HL parameter $\omega$, but the effective potential increases. And, it
also turns out that the trajectories of light rays emitted from the north pole
direction are defined as the direct emission, lensing ring and photon ring of
KS black hole, on the basis of orbits $n = \phi/2\pi$. As black hole surrounded
by thin disk accretion, we show that the corresponding transfer functions have
their values increased with the parameter $\omega$. More importantly, we also
find that the direct emissions always dominate the total observed intensity,
while lensing rings as a thin ring make a very small contribution and photon
ring as a extremely narrow ring make a negligible contribution, for all three
toy-model functions. In view of this, the results finally imply that shadows
and rings as the observational appearance of KS black hole exhibit some obvious
interesting features, which might be regarded as an effective way to
distinguish black holes in HL gravity from the Schwarzschild black hole.

operators. This is motivated by the fact that positive Hankel operators are
described in terms of their Carleson measures, whereas the compatibility
condition between representations and reflection positive Hilbert spaces is
quite intricate. This leads us to the concept of a Hankel positive
representation of triples $(G,S,\tau)$, where $G$ is a group, $\tau$ an
involutive automorphism of $G$ and $S \subseteq G$ a subsemigroup with $\tau(S)
= S^{-1}$. For the triples $(\mathbb Z,\mathbb N,-id_{\mathbb Z})$,
corresponding to reflection positive operators, and $(\mathbb R,\mathbb
R_+,-id_{\mathbb R})$, corresponding to reflection positive one-parameter
groups, we show that every Hankel positive representation can be made
reflection positive by a slight change of the scalar product. A key method
consists in using the measure $\mu_H$ on $\mathbb R_+$ defined by a positive
Hankel operator $H$ on $H^2(\mathbb C_+)$ to define a Pick function whose
imaginary part, restricted to the imaginary axis, provides an operator symbol
for $H$.

This framework consists of two main steps, namely a dimensionality reduction
step of input electricity consumption data, followed by an unsupervised
clustering algorithm of the reduced subspace. While any algorithm, which has
been used in the literature for the aforementioned clustering task, can be used
for the corresponding step, the more important question is to deduce which
particular combination of algorithms is the best for a given dataset and a

optics. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using monolithic diamond
channel-cut crystals as high-heat-load, beam-multiplexing, narrow-band,
mechanically-stable x-ray monochromators with high-power x-ray beams at
cutting-edge, high-repetition-rate x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facilities.
The diamond channel-cut crystals fabricated and characterized in these studies
are designed as two-bounce Bragg reflection monochromators directing 14.4-keV
or 12.4-keV x-rays within a 15-meV-bandwidth to $^{57}$Fe or $^{45}$Sc nuclear
resonant scattering experiments, respectively. The crystal design allows
out-of-band x-rays within a $\simeq 1$-eV XFEL bandwidth to be transmitted with
minimal losses to alternative simultaneous experiments. Only $\lesssim 2$\% of
the incident $\simeq 100$-W x-ray beam is absorbed in a 50-$\mu$m-thick first
diamond crystal reflector, ensuring that the monochromator crystal is highly
stable. Other x-ray optics applications of diamond channel-cut crystals are
anticipated.

  Curl",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The variational principle (VP) is designed to generate non-folding grids
(diffeomorphisms) with prescribed Jacobian determinant (JD) and curl. Its
solution pool of the original VP is based on an additive formulation and,
consequently, is not invariant in the diffeomorphic Lie algebra. The original
VP works well when the prescribed pair of JD and curl is calculated from a
diffeomorphism, but not necessarily when the prescribed JD and curl are not
known to come from a diffeomorphism. This issue is referred as the mismatched
pair problem. In spite of that, the original VP works effectively in 2D grid
generations. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we describe a new version
of VP (revised VP), which is based on composition of transformations and,
therefore, is invariant in the Lie algebra. The revised VP seems have overcome
the inaccuracy of original VP in 3D grid generations. In the following
sections, the mathematical derivations are presented. It is shown that the
revised VP can calculate the inverse transformation of a known diffeomorphism.
Its inverse consistency and transitivity of transformations are also
demonstrated numerically. Moreover, a computational strategy is formulated
based on the new version of VP to handle the mismatch issue and is demonstrated
with preliminary result.

called the weighted-variational model, as a surrogate model to reduce numerical
complexity and execution times for simulations of brittle fractures. In the
weighed-variational model, we propose applying a Gaussian random field with a
Mat\'ern covariance function to simulate a non-homogeneous energy release rate
($G_c$) of a material. The FEniCS open-source software is used to obtain
numerical solutions to the weighed-variational and the more standard but
computationally demanding hybrid phase-field models. Results have shown the
weighted-variational model as a competitive surrogate model of the hybrid
phase-field method to emulate brittle fractures for real structures, reducing
execution times by 90\%, opening the possibility of a Monte Carlo study of
brittle fractures under random release rates $G_c$. We perform such a study and
compare our results with a brittle fracture laboratory experiment.

  considering electromagnetic flux coupling","18 pages, 13 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC nlin.AO nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyse the dynamics of the improved discretised version of the well known
Izhikevich neuronmodel under the action of external electromagnetic field. It
is found that the three-dimensional IZHmap shows rich dynamics. With the
variation of the electromagnetic field, period-doubling routeto chaos in a
repeating fashion is observed from the bifurcation diagram. Even the forward
andbackward continuation bifurcation diagram which do not completely overlap
suggests that there is multistability in the system. The phenomenon of
bistability (coexistence of periodic and chaotic attractors) is observed. The
presence of periodic and chaotic attractor is aided by the maximal Lyapunov
exponent diagram. The Lyapunov phase diagram of electromagnetic field and
synapses current shows a large parameter region of chaotic and periodic
behaviors with the presence of unbounded regions as well. The IZH map shows a
plethora of spiking and bursting patterns such as mixed-mode patterns, tonic
spiking, phasic spiking, steady spikes, regular spikes, spike bursting,
periodic bursting, phasic bursting, chaotic firing, etc with the variation of
electromagnetic coupling strength and the synapses current. We also investigate
the presence of chimera states in a ring-star, ring, star network of IZH map
neurons. Chimera states are found in the case of ring-star and ring network
while synchronised clusters were found in the case of star network and are
aided by the spatiotemporal plots, space-time plot, recurrence plots. The rich
dynamics shown by the discretised IZH map makes it a promising research model
to study about neurodynamics.

have recently begun to be explored in the context of drug discovery and have
the potential to assist in key challenges such as target identification. In the
drug discovery domain, KGs can be employed as part of a process which can
result in lab-based experiments being performed, or impact on other decisions,
incurring significant time and financial costs and most importantly, ultimately
influencing patient healthcare. For KGE models to have impact in this domain, a
better understanding of not only of performance, but also the various factors
which determine it, is required. In this study we investigate, over the course
of many thousands of experiments, the predictive performance of five KGE models
on two public drug discovery-oriented KGs. Our goal is not to focus on the best
overall model or configuration, instead we take a deeper look at how
performance can be affected by changes in the training setup, choice of
hyperparameters, model parameter initialisation seed and different splits of
the datasets. Our results highlight that these factors have significant impact
on performance and can even affect the ranking of models. Indeed these factors
should be reported along with model architectures to ensure complete
reproducibility and fair comparisons of future work, and we argue this is
critical for the acceptance of use, and impact of KGEs in a biomedical setting.

Network (ANN) for solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE)
of either fractional or ordinary orders. Firstly, a discretization method is
employed to change the model into a sequence of Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODE). Then each of these ODEs is solved with the aid of an ANN. Adam
optimization is employed as the learning paradigm since it can add the
foreknowledge of slowing down the process of optimization when getting close to
the actual optimum solution. The model also takes advantage of fine tuning for
speeding up the process and domain mapping to confront infinite domain issue.
Finally, the accuracy, speed, and convergence of the method for solving several
types of Black-Scholes model are reported.

  This gap in the development of the SR formalism reflects the lack of some
significant velocity subtraction operations. The differential application of
these operations leads to a relativistic acceleration.
