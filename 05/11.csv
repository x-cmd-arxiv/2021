coefficients of the Ehrhart polynomial of matroid polytopes by De Loera, Haws
and K\""oppe (2007) and of generalized permutohedra by Castillo and Liu (2015).
We prove constructively that for every $n\geq 19$ there exist connected
matroids on $n$ elements that are not Ehrhart positive. Also, we prove that for
every $k\geq 3$ there exist connected matroids of rank $k$ that are not Ehrhart
positive. Our proofs rely on our previous results on the geometric
interpretation of the operation of circuit-hyperplane relaxation and our
formulas for the Ehrhart polynomials of hypersimplices and minimal matroids.
This allows us to give a precise expression for the Ehrhart polynomials of all
sparse paving matroids, a class of matroids which is conjectured to be
predominant and which contains the counterexamples arising from our
construction.

probability is constructed by sampling Clifford channels with an appropriate

and find that the proposed sampling-based method is feasible even for planar

from general relativity arise once a certain threshold in curvature is
exceeded, while being entirely absent below that threshold. For black holes,
scalarization is known to be triggered by a coupling between a scalar and the
Gauss-Bonnet invariant. A coupling with the Ricci scalar, which can trigger
scalarization in neutron stars, is instead known to not contribute to the onset
of black hole scalarization, and has so far been largely ignored in the
literature when studying scalarized black holes. In this paper, we study the
combined effect of both these couplings on black hole scalarization. We show
that the Ricci coupling plays a significant role in the properties of
scalarized solutions and their domain of existence. This work is an important

iterative optimisation heuristics. However, methods for detecting structural
bias have not yet fully matured, and recent studies have uncovered many
interesting questions. One of these is the question of how structural bias can
be related to anisotropy. Intuitively, an algorithm that is not isotropic would
be considered structurally biased. However, there have been cases where
algorithms appear to only show SB in some dimensions. As such, we investigate
whether these algorithms actually exhibit anisotropy, and how this impacts the
detection of SB. We find that anisotropy is very rare, and even in cases where
it is present, there are clear tests for SB which do not rely on any
assumptions of isotropy, so we can safely expand the suite of SB tests to
encompass these kinds of deficiencies not found by the original tests.
  We propose several additional testing procedures for SB detection and aim to
motivate further research into the creation of a robust portfolio of tests.
This is crucial since no single test will be able to work effectively with all

imposing a sudden area enlargement, which provides a rapid lateral divergence
of the gases in the reaction zone and attenuates the leading shock. For
sufficiently small tube diameter, the detonation decays to a deflagration and
the shock decays to negligible strengths. This is known as the critical tube
diameter problem. In the present study, we provide a closed form model to
predict the detonation quenching for 2D channels. Whitham's geometric shock
dynamics, coupled with a shock evolution law based on shocks sustained by a
constant source obtained by the shock change equations of Radulescu, is shown
to capture the lateral shock dynamics response to the failure wave originating
at the expansion corner. A criterion for successful detonation transmission to
open space is that the lateral strain rate provided by the failure wave not
exceed the critical strain rate of steady curved detonations. Using the
critical lateral strain rate obtained by He and Clavin, a closed form solution
is obtained for the critical channel opening permitting detonation
transmission. The predicted critical channel width is found in very good
agreement with our recent experiments and simulations of diffracting

We test various levels of pooling parameters, with and without solar data as a

  Databases (Technical Report)",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many real-world applications such as business planning and sensor data
monitoring, one important, yet challenging, the task is to rank objects(e.g.,
products, documents, or spatial objects) based on their ranking scores and
efficiently return those objects with the highest scores. In practice, due to
the unreliability of data sources, many real-world objects often contain noises
and are thus imprecise and uncertain. In this paper, we study the problem of
probabilistic top-k dominating(PTD) query on such large-scale uncertain data in
a distributed environment, which retrieves k uncertain objects from distributed
uncertain databases(on multiple distributed servers), having the largest
ranking scores with high confidences. In order to efficiently tackle the
distributed PTD problem, we propose a MapReduce framework for processing
distributed PTD queries over distributed uncertain databases. In this MapReduce
framework, we design effective pruning strategies to filter out false alarms in
the distributed setting, propose cost-model-based index distribution mechanisms
over servers, and develop efficient distributed PTD query processing
algorithms. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and
effectiveness of our proposed distributed PTD approach on both real and
synthetic data sets through various experimental settings.

  Firstly, we initiate the general study of quantum tamper detection codes,

was no tampering, we would like to output the message $m$ with a probability of
$1$. We show that quantum tamper detection codes exist for both classical
messages and quantum messages for any family of unitaries $\mathcal{U}$, such
that $|\mathcal{U}| < 2^{2^{\alpha n}}$ for some known constant $\alpha \in

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Far from Identity : For each $U \in \mathcal{U}$, we require that its
modulus of trace value isn't too much i.e. $ |Trace(U)| \leq \phi N$, where
$N=2^n.$

  Quantum tamper-detection codes are quantum generalizations of classical
tamper detection codes studied by Jafargholi et al. \cite{JW15}.
  Additionally for classical message $m$, if we must either output message $m$

show that it is possible without the restriction of Far from Identity condition

of tampering unitaries are from Pauli group $\mathcal{P}_n$, which can be
thought of as a quantum version of the algebraic manipulation detection (AMD)

the single-particle structure of nuclei. When applied to one-neutron halo

  Purpose: We reanalyze the one-neutron knockout measurements of $^{11}$Be and
$^{15}$C-both one-neutron halo nuclei-on beryllium at about 60MeV/nucleon. We
consider Halo-EFT descriptions of these nuclei which already provide excellent
agreement with breakup and transfer data.
  Method: We include a Halo-EFT description of the projectile within an
eikonal-based model of the reaction and compare its outcome to existing data.
  Results: Excellent agreement with experiment is found for both nuclei. The
asymptotic normalization coefficients inferred from this comparison confirm
predictions from \emph{ab initio} nuclear-structure calculations and values
deduced from transfer data.
  Conclusions: Halo-EFT can be reliably used to analyze one-neutron knockout

orbital angular momentum transport (OAM) in a Permalloy (Py) / oxidized Cu
(Cu*) heterostructure: the orbital Rashba-Edelstein magnetoresistance. The
angular dependence of the MR depends on the relative angle between the induced
OAM and the magnetization in a similar fashion as the spin Hall
magnetoresistance (SMR). Despite the absence of elements with large spin-orbit
coupling, we find a sizable MR ratio, which is in contrast to the conventional
SMR which requires heavy elements. By varying the thickness of the Cu* layer,
we confirm that the interface is responsible for the MR, suggesting that the
orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect is responsible for the generation of the OAM.
Through Py thickness-dependence studies, we find that the effective values for
the spin diffusion and spin dephasing lengths of Py are significantly larger
than the values measured in Py / Pt bilayers, approximately by the factor of 2
and 4, respectively. This implies that another mechanism beyond the
conventional spin-based scenario is responsible for the MR observed in Py / Cu*

unambiguously demonstrate the current-induced torque without using any heavy

fundamental processes at work in many astrophysical plasma. Solving the exact
evolution equations is hard and one common simplification is based on
Fokker-Planck (FP) approximations of the Compton collision term. Here we carry
out a detailed numerical comparison of several FP approaches with the exact
scattering kernel solution for a range of test problems assuming isotropic
media and thermal electrons at various temperatures. The Kompaneets equation,
being one of the most widely used FP approximations, fails to account for
Klein-Nishina corrections and enhanced Doppler boosts and recoil at high
energies. These can be accounted for with an alternative FP approach based on
the exact first and second moments of the scattering kernel. As demonstrated
here, the latter approach works very well in dilute media, but inherently fails
to reproduce the correct equilibrium solution in the limit of many scattering.
Conditions for the applicability of the FP approximations are clarified,
overall showing that the Kompaneets equation provides the most robust
approximation to the full problem, even if inaccurate in many cases. We close
our numerical analysis by briefly illustrating the solutions for the spectral
distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) after photon injection at
redshift $z\lesssim 10^5$, when double Compton and Bremsstrahlung emission can
be omitted. We demonstrate that the exact treatment using the scattering kernel
computed with {\tt CSpack} is often needed. This work should provide an
important step towards accurate computations of the CMB spectral distortions

tuning the two-body interactions to an $s$- or $p$-wave dimer resonance or to a

is realized with the help of quintic self-defocusing. Here we present
physically relevant antidark singular-vortex states in these systems, existing
on top of a flat background. Numerical solutions for them are very accurately
approximated by the Thomas-Fermi wave function. Their stability exactly obeys
an analytical criterion derived for small perturbations. It is demonstrated
that the singular vortices can be excited by the input in the form of ordinary
nonsingular vortices, hence the singular modes can be created in the
experiment. We also consider regular (dark) vortices maintained by the flat
background, under the action of the repulsive central potential ~ +1/r^2. The
dark modes with vorticities l = 0 and l = 1 are completely stable. In the case
when the central potential is attractive, but the effective one, which includes
the centrifugal term, is repulsive, and a weak trapping potential ~ r^2 is
added, dark vortices with l = 1 feature an intricate pattern of alternating
stability and instability regions. Under the action of the instability, states
with l = 1 travel along tangled trajectories, which stay in a finite area
defined by the trap. The analysis is also reported for dark vortices with l =
2, which feature a complex structure of alternating intervals of stability and
instability against splitting. Lastly, simple but novel flat vortices are found
at the border between the anidark and dark ones.

magnetically frustrated states can be reversibly created and dissolved by
applying an external magnetic field. This easiness to insert and remove

significant advantage of three-dimensional nanomagnetism compared to planar

Recently, efficient VIX pricing Monte Carlo methods have been proposed for the

Following recent empirical data, we discuss the VIX option pricing problem for
a generalized framework of these models, where the vol-of-vol may depend on the
volatility and/or not be Markovian. In such a setting, the aforementioned Monte
Carlo methods are not valid. Moreover, the classical least squares Monte Carlo
faces exponentially increasing complexity with the number of grid time steps,

use of analytic potentials and simple mixing rules to model interfacial
systems, with minimal justification for their use. On the other hand,
contemporary machine learned interatomic potentials have greater complexity,
but have not seen rigorous validation of interfacial heat transport properties.
Moreover, when fitting to ab initio data, it is not known whether interface
systems small enough to be tractable for density functional theory calculations
can produce reasonable interatomic force constants. These and related questions
are studied herein using a model Ge/GaAs system, with a particular focus on the
harmonic force constants (IFC2s) of the interface. The ab initio IFC2s are
shown to recover near bulk-like values ~ 1-2 nm away from the interface, while
also exhibiting a complex relationship across the interface that likely
precludes any successful application of mixing rules. Two different spectral
neighborhood analysis potentials (SNAP) are developed to model the interface.
One is fit to the total forces, while the other is only used to describe the
anharmonicity, with a Taylor expansion used to describe the harmonic portion of
the potential. Each potential, along with their merits and issues are compared

computation complexity of GNN inference, it is hard to deploy GNNs for
large-scale or real-time applications. In this paper, we propose to accelerate
GNN inference by pruning the dimensions in each layer with negligible accuracy
loss. Our pruning framework uses a novel LASSO regression formulation for GNNs
to identify feature dimensions (channels) that have high influence on the
output activation. We identify two inference scenarios and design pruning
schemes based on their computation and memory usage for each. To further reduce
the inference complexity, we effectively store and reuse hidden features of
visited nodes, which significantly reduces the number of supporting nodes
needed to compute the target embedding. We evaluate the proposed method with
the node classification problem on five popular datasets and a real-time spam
detection application. We demonstrate that the pruned GNN models greatly reduce
computation and memory usage with little accuracy loss. For full inference, the
proposed method achieves an average of 3.27x speedup with only 0.002 drop in
F1-Micro on GPU. For batched inference, the proposed method achieves an average
of 6.67x speedup with only 0.003 drop in F1-Micro on CPU. To the best of our

ferromagnets have evinced the existence of a gap at the Dirac point in their

in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya or Kitaev (DM/K) interactions and suggested to
set the stage for topologically protected edge states to sustain
non-dissipative spin transport. We perform state-of-the-art simulations of the
spin-wave spectra in monolayer CrI$_3$, based on time-dependent
density-functional perturbation theory (TDDFpT) and fully accounting for
spin-orbit couplings (SOC) from which DM/K interactions ultimately stem. While
our results are in qualitative agreement with experiments, the computed TDDFpT
magnon gap at the Dirac point is found to be 0.47~meV, roughly 6 times smaller
than the most recent experimental estimates, so questioning that intralayer
anisotropies alone can explain the observed gap. Lattice-dynamical
calculations, performed within density-functional perturbation theory (DFpT),
indicate that a substantial degeneracy and a strong coupling between
vibrational and magnetic excitations exist in this system, providing a possible
additional gap-opening mechanism in the spin-wave spectra. In order to pursue
this path, we introduce an interacting magnon-phonon Hamiltonian featuring a
linear coupling between lattice and spin fluctuations, enabled by the magnetic
anisotropy induced by SOC. Upon determination of the relevant interaction
constants by DFpT and supercell calculations, this model allows us to propose
magnon-phonon interactions as an important microscopic mechanism responsible
for the enhancement of the gap in the range of $\approx 4$~meV around the Dirac
point of the CrI$_3$ monolayer.

has emerged as a powerful strategy, becoming a part of large-scale studies,
such as the Human Connectome Project. However, when SMS imaging is combined
with in-plane acceleration for higher acceleration rates, conventional SMS
reconstruction methods may suffer from noise amplification and other artifacts.
Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have gained interest for improving MRI
reconstruction. However, these methods are typically trained in a supervised
manner that necessitates fully-sampled reference data, which is not feasible in
highly-accelerated fMRI acquisitions. Self-supervised learning that does not
require fully-sampled data has recently been proposed and has shown similar
performance to supervised learning. However, it has only been applied for
in-plane acceleration. Furthermore the effect of DL reconstruction on
subsequent fMRI analysis remains unclear. In this work, we extend
self-supervised DL reconstruction to SMS imaging. Our results on prospectively

analysis remains unaltered by DL processing, while the improved temporal

produces multiple images separated in time by minutes to months. These images
appear as repeated events in the detectors: gravitational-wave pairs, triplets,

demonstrate how the methodology can be applied to any number of lensed images,

how radio and gamma-ray observations can be used to constrain CR distributions
and resulting high-energy emission for the Coma cluster. We take into account
the radial diffusion of CRs and follow the time evolution of their

CR injection that is consistent with the observed RH surface brightness. We
find that the required injection profile is non-trivial, depending on whether
CR electrons have the primary or secondary origin. Although the secondary CR
electron scenario predicts larger gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, it is in

Recently, unconventional chiral charge order has been reported in kagome

higher than the TC. However, the chirality of the charge order has not been
reported in the cousin kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and the electronic nature
of the chirality remains elusive. In this letter, we report the observation of
electronic chiral charge order in CsV3Sb5 via scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM). We observe a 2x2 charge modulation and a 1x4 superlattice in both
topographic data and tunneling spectroscopy. 2x2 charge modulation is highly
anticipated as a charge order by fundamental kagome lattice models at van Hove
filling, and is shown to exhibit intrinsic chirality. We find that the 1x4
superlattices forms various small domain walls, and can be a surface effect as
supported by our first-principles calculations. Crucially, we find that the
amplitude of the energy gap opened by the charge order exhibits real space
modulations, and features 2x2 wave vectors with chirality, highlighting the
electronic nature of the chiral charge order. STM study at 0.4K reveals a
superconducting energy gap with a gap size 2{\Delta}=0.85meV, which estimates a
moderate superconductivity coupling strength with 2{\Delta}/kBTc=3.9. When

decomposition of a state vector into branches by finding the minimum of a
measure of the mean squared quantum complexity of the branches in the branch
decomposition. In a non-relativistic formulation of this proposal, branching
occurs repeatedly over time, with each branch splitting successively into
further sub-branches among which the branch followed by the real world is
chosen randomly according to the Born rule. In a Lorentz covariant version, the
real world is a single random draw from the set of branches at asymptotically
late time, restored to finite time by sequentially retracing the set of
branching events implied by the late time choice. The complexity measure
depends on a parameter $b$ with units of volume which sets the boundary between
quantum and classical behavior. The value of $b$ is, in principle, accessible
to experiment.

'high-order' VHSs in the cuprates and related high-Tc superconductors and show
that the anomalous divergences in their spectra are driven by the electronic

such that materials with higher order VHSs display higher Tc's. We further show
that the presence of the normal and higher-order VHSs in the electronic

a material toward correlated phases such as excitonic insulators or
supermetals. Our study opens up a new materials playground for exploring the

pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators, we will argue that the window weighted overdensity
field can yield more optimal measurements as the window acts as an inverse
noise weight, an effect that becomes more important for surveys with a variable
selection function. We then discuss the impact of approximations made in the
{\sc Master} algorithm and suggest improvements, the {\sc $i$Master} algorithm,
that uses the theoretical model to give unbiased results for arbitrarily
complex windows provided that the model satisfies weak accuracy conditions. The
methodology of {\sc $i$Master} algorithm is also generalized to the correlation
functions to reconstruct the binned power spectra, for E/B mode separation, or
to properly convolve the correlation functions to account for the scale cuts in
the Fourier space model. We also show that the errors in the window estimation
lead to both additive and multiplicative effects on the over density field.
Multiplicative effects show up as mis-estimated window power and are typically
higher order but can be important at the few percent precision requirements.
Accurate estimation of window power can be required up to scales of $\sim
2\ell_\text{max}$ or larger. Misestimation of the window power leads to biases
in the measured power spectra which scale as ${\delta C_\ell}\sim
M^W_{\ell\ell'}\delta W_{\ell'}$, where the $M^W_{\ell\ell'}$ scales as
$\sim(2\ell+1)C_\ell$ leading to effects that can be important at high $\ell$.

Motivated by the proposed link between magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs),

Galactic distributions are consistent with other extragalactic transients much

exploiting those regions by performing a local search. Moreover, a restart

larger by $\sim1$ dex at a fixed SFR, or the best-fit Schechter parameter of
$\mathrm{SFR}^*$ is larger by $\sim1$ dex. We extensively examine several
assumptions on SED fitting to see the robustness of our result, and find that
the excess still exist even if the assumptions change such as star formation
histories, dust extinction laws, and one- or two-component model. By
integrating our SFRF to $0.22\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, the cosmic star

that there are approximately five times as many satellite galaxies at this high

0.526$\pm0.018$ seen in the corresponding Pan-STARRS PS1 image and marginally
detected as a faint ROSAT All-Sky Survey X-ray source. The lensed images
exhibit properties similar to those of other folds where the source galaxy
falls very close to or straddles the caustic of a galaxy cluster. The folded
images are stretched in a direction roughly orthogonal to the critical curve,
but the configuration is that of a tangential cusp. Guided by morphological
features, published simulations and similar fold observations in the
literature, we identify a third or counter-image, confirmed by spectroscopy.
Because the fold-configuration shows highly distinctive surface brightness
features, follow-up observations of microlensing or detailed investigations of
the individual surface brightness features at higher resolution can further
shed light on kpc-scale dark matter properties. We determine the local lens
properties at the positions of the multiple images according to the
observation-based lens reconstruction of Wagner et al. (2019). The analysis is
in accordance with a mass density which hardly varies on an arc-second scale (6
kpc) over the areas covered by the multiple images.

Standard Model by kinetically mixing with the visible photon. For small values
of the mixing parameter, dark photons can evade cosmological bounds to be a
viable dark matter candidate. Due to the similarities with the electromagnetic
signals generated by axions, several bounds on dark photon signals are simply
reinterpretations of historical bounds set by axion haloscopes. However, the
dark photon has a property that the axion does not: an intrinsic polarisation.
Due to the rotation of the Earth, accurately accounting for this polarisation
is nontrivial, highly experiment-dependent, and depends upon assumptions about
the dark photon's production mechanism. We show that if one does account for
the DP polarisation, and the rotation of the Earth, an experiment's discovery
reach can be enhanced by over an order of magnitude. We detail the strategies
that would need to be taken to properly optimise a dark photon search. These
include judiciously choosing the location and orientation of the experiment, as
well as strategically timing any repeated measurements. Experiments located at
$\pm$35$^\circ$ or $\pm$55$^\circ$ latitude, making three observations at
different times of the sidereal day, can achieve a sensitivity that is fully
optimised and insensitive to the dark photon's polarisation state, and hence
its production mechanism. We also point out that several well-known searches

set exclusion limits on dark photons, and hence should not be reinterpreted as

kinematic tracers beyond 95 kpc (~5.2 effective radii) for M49 for the first

~20'-30' (~100-150 kpc), the GC kinematics sampled along the minor photometric
axis of M49 become increasingly hotter, indicating a transition from GCs
related to M49 to those representing the Virgo B intra-cluster medium. Second,
there is an anomaly in the line-of-sight radial velocity dispersion

the kinematics cool by $\Delta \sigma_{r,los}~150$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to
those in- or outward. The kinematic fingerprint of a previous accretion event
is hinted at in projected phase-space, and we isolate GCs that both give rise
to this feature, and are spatially co-located with two prominent stellar shells
in the halo of M49. Third, we find a subsample of GCs with velocities
representative of the dwarf galaxy VCC1249 that is currently interacting with
M49. The spatial distribution of these GCs closely resembles the morphology of
VCC1249's isophotes, indicating that several of these GCs are likely in the act
of being stripped from the dwarf during its passage through M49's halo. Taken
together, these results point toward the opportunity of witnessing on-going

curves of realistically baryonified haloes in an N-body simulation, including
the quasi-adiabatic relaxation of the dark matter profile of each halo in
response to its baryons. We study the predicted $W_{50}$ distribution using a
realistic pipeline applied to noisy profiles extracted from our
luminosity-complete mock catalog with an ALFALFA-like survey geometry and
redshift selection. Our default mock is in good agreement with observed ALFALFA
results for $W_{50}\gtrsim700$ km/s, being incomplete at lower widths due to
the intrinsic threshold of $M_r\leq-19$. Variations around the default model
show that the velocity width function at $W_{50}\gtrsim300$ km/s is most
sensitive to a possible correlation between galaxy inclination and host
concentration, followed by the physics of quasi-adiabatic relaxation. We also
study the excess kurtosis of noiseless velocity profiles, obtaining a
distribution which tightly correlates with $W_{50}$, with a shape and scatter
that depend on the properties of the turbulent HI disk. Our results open the

acquire nematic (N) and, at higher activity, crystalline (K) order. Similarly,
the cold zone of a nematic initial state undergoes smectic (Sm) and crystal

cosmological hydrodynamical simulation and its merger tree to identify
backsplash galaxies. We find that backsplashers as massive ($\geq 4.0 \times
10^{10} M_\odot$) and distant ($\geq 1.2$ Mpc) as NGC 3109 are extremely rare,
with none having also gained energy during the interaction with their previous

study is the reduction of Yang Mills in $2+1$ dimension to $0+1$ dimensions,
which has been corrected with an additional potential that can be interpreted
as a zero point energy for fermions. Our goal is to understand the lifetime of
such a classical bound state object in the classical regime. To do so, we pay
particular attention to when D-particles separate to check that the ""off
diagonal modes"" of the matrices become adiabatic and use that information to
improve on existing models of evaporation. It turns out that the naive
expectation value of the lifetime with the fermionic correction is infinite.
This is a logarithmic divergence that arises from very large excursions in the
separation between the branes near the threshold for classical evaporation. The
adiabatic behavior lets us get some analytic control of the dynamics in this
regime to get this estimate. This divergence is cutoff in the quantum theory
due to quantization of the adiabatic parameter, resulting in a long lifetime of
the bound state, with a parametric dependence of order $\log(1/\hbar)$.

magnifications of the lensed images, in the case of covariant $f(T)$ gravity.
We first extract the spherically symmetric solutions for both the pure-tetrad
and the covariant formulation of the theory, since considering spherical
solutions the extension to the latter is crucial, in order for the results not
to suffer from frame-dependent artifacts. Applying the weak-field, perturbative
approximation we extract the deviations of the solutions comparing to General
Relativity. Furthermore, we calculate the deflection angle and then the
differences of the positions and magnifications in the lensing framework. This
effect of consistent $f(T)$ gravity on the lensing features can serve as an
observable signature in the realistic cases where $f(T)$ is expected to deviate
only slightly from General Relativity, since lensing scales in general are not
restricted as in the case of Solar System data, and therefore deviations from
General Relativity could be observed more easily.

Principal component analysis and non-LTE multi-transition analysis have shown
that the [CI] emission predominantly originates from the low-excitation gas

whereas $\mathrm{C^0}$ abundance is likely suppressed in the high-excitation

in the CMZ is 0.3-0.4, which is 2-3 times that in the Galactic disk. The
$N(\mathrm{C}^0)$/$N(\mathrm{CO})$ ratio increases to 0.7 in the innermost 10

$\mathrm{C^0}$-rich regions distributed in a ring-shape encircling the
supernova remnant (SNR) Sgr A east, indicative that the
$\mathrm{C}^0$-enrichment in the central 10 pc region is a consequence of a
molecular cloud-SNR interaction. In the 15 atom/molecules included in principal

The physical processes driving the formation of Galactic spiral arms

kinematic information of the Solar neighbourhood to simulations, find a better
agreement with short-lived arms with a transient behaviour. Aims. Our aim is to
provide an observational, data-driven view of the Milky Way spiral structure
and its dynamics using open clusters as the main tracers, and to contrast it
with simulation-based approaches. We use the most complete catalogue of Milky
Way open clusters, with astrometric Gaia EDR3 updated parameters, estimated
astrophysical information and radial velocities, to re-visit the nature of the
spiral pattern of the Galaxy. Methods. We use a Gaussian mixture model to
detect overdensities of open clusters younger than 30 Myr that correspond to
the Perseus, Local, Sagittarius and Scutum spiral arms, respectively. We use
the birthplaces of the open cluster population younger than 80 Myr to trace the
evolution of the different spiral arms and compute their pattern speed. We
analyse the age distribution of the open clusters across the spiral arms to
explore the differences in the rotational velocity of stars and spiral arms.
Results. We are able to increase the range in Galactic azimuth where
present-day spiral arms are described, better estimating its parameters by
adding 264 young open clusters to the 84 high-mass star-forming regions used so
far, thus increasing by a 314% the number of tracers. We use the evolution of
the open clusters from their birth positions to find that spiral arms nearly
co-rotate with field stars at any given radius, discarding a common spiral
pattern speed for the spiral arms explored. [abridged]

many generate multiple conflicts.
  In this paper, we study conflict-generating decisions in CDCL in detail. We
investigate the impact of single conflict (sc) decisions, which generate only
one conflict, and multi-conflict (mc) decisions which generate two or more. We
empirically characterize these two types of decisions based on the quality of

forming a chain of clauses. This leads to the consideration of similarity
between conflicts, for which we formulate the notion of conflictsproximity as a
similarity measure. We show that conflicts in mc decisions are more closely
related than consecutive conflicts generated from sc decisions. Finally, we
develop Common Reason Variable Reduction (CRVR) as a new decision strategy that
reduces the selection priority of some variables from the learned clauses of mc
decisions. Our empirical evaluation of CRVR implemented in three leading
solvers demonstrates performance gains in benchmarks from the main track of SAT

been limited to large planets and individual systems. As current surveys
routinely detect planets down to terrestrial size in these systems, a more
holistic approach that reflects their diverse architectures is timely. Here, we
investigate planet formation around low-mass stars and identify differences in
the statistical distribution of planets. We compare the synthetic planet
populations to observed exoplanets. We used the Generation III Bern model of
planet formation and evolution to calculate synthetic populations varying the
central star from solar-like stars to ultra-late M dwarfs. This model includes
planetary migration, N-body interactions between embryos, accretion of
planetesimals and gas, and long-term contraction and loss of the gaseous
atmospheres. We find that temperate, Earth-sized planets are most frequent
around early M dwarfs and more rare for solar-type stars and late M dwarfs. The
planetary mass distribution does not linearly scale with the disk mass. The
reason is the emergence of giant planets for M*>0.5 Msol, which leads to the
ejection of smaller planets. For M*>0.3 Msol there is sufficient mass in the
majority of systems to form Earth-like planets, leading to a similar amount of
Exo-Earths going from M to G dwarfs. In contrast, the number of super-Earths
and larger planets increases monotonically with stellar mass. We further
identify a regime of disk parameters that reproduces observed M-dwarf systems
such as TRAPPIST-1. However, giant planets around late M dwarfs such as GJ
3512b only form when type I migration is substantially reduced. We quantify the
stellar mass dependence of multi-planet systems using global simulations of
planet formation and evolution. The results compare well to current
observational data and predicts trends that can be tested with future
observations.

tests were conducted at temperatures ranging from 298 to 873 K under the strain
rate of 0.001s-1. The experimented material exhibited an extraordinary room
temperature work hardening behavior, in respect of both the instantaneous
strain hardening exponent and the work hardening rate values. This resulted in
an acceptable ultimate tensile strength /ductility balance and was justified
considering the high activity of twinning and planar slip. Such work hardening
capacity deteriorated at higher temperatures due to increasing the dislocation
annihilation rate and the stacking fault energy values that suppressed twin
formation and dislocation accumulation. However, the decrease in amplitude and
extent of the work hardening region was insignificant compared with other
single-phase high entropy alloys. This was attributed to the high capacity of
the alloy for dislocation storage at various deformation temperatures. The
serrated flow was observed at 773 and 873 K due to the dynamic strain aging
(DSA) mechanism. Interestingly, in this case, the DSA mechanism has a
beneficial effect on overall ductility, which was attributed to the increase in
the strain hardening exponent result in a delay of necking. Texture examination
also reveals the formation of a double fiber texture due to the simultaneous
contribution of twinning and octahedral slip.

construct high order schemes to solve the elliptic interface problems with

inside a rectangular region $\Omega$. In this paper, we consider the elliptic
interface problem $-\nabla\cdot (a \nabla u)=f$ in $\Omega\setminus \Gamma$
with Dirichlet boundary conditions, where the coefficient $a$ and the source
term $f$ are smooth in $\Omega\setminus \Gamma$ and the two nonzero jump
condition functions $[u]$ and $[a\nabla u\cdot \vec{n}]$ across $\Gamma$ are
smooth along $\Gamma$. To solve such elliptic interface problems, we propose a
high order compact finite difference scheme for numerically computing both the

changing coordinates into local coordinates. Our numerical experiments confirm
the fourth order accuracy for computing the solution $u$, the gradient $\nabla

structure displays local re-entrant geometry at its vertices, and is shown to
be auxetic when modelled as an equilibrium configuration of spatial constraints
subject to a quasi-static deformation. When the tensegrity structure is
subsequently modelled as a lattice material with elastic elements, the auxetic

demonstrated with a 3d printed example. The cubic symmetry of the structure
means that the behaviour is independent of the chosen stretching direction and
the auxetic behaviour is observed in both perpendicular directions. This

matter, we study the Einstein equations coupled with a charged/massive scalar
field with spherically symmetric characteristic data relaxing to a
Reissner-Nordstr\""om event horizon. Contrary to the vacuum case, the relaxation
rate is conjectured to be slow (non-integrable), opening the possibility that
the matter fields and the metric coefficients blow up in amplitude at the
Cauchy horizon, not just in energy. We show that whether this blow-up in
amplitude occurs or not depends on a novel oscillation condition on the event
horizon which determines whether or not a resonance is excited dynamically. If
the oscillation condition is satisfied, then the resonance is not excited and
we show boundedness and continuous extendibility of the matter fields and the
metric across the Cauchy horizon. If the oscillation condition is violated,
then by the combined effect of slow decay and the resonance being excited, we
show that the massive uncharged scalar field blows up in amplitude. In our
companion paper, we show that in the latter case a novel null contraction
singularity forms at the Cauchy horizon, across which the metric is not
continuously extendible in the usual sense. Heuristic arguments in the physics
literature indicate that the oscillation condition should be satisfied
generically on the event horizon. If these heuristics are true, then our result
falsifies the $C^0$-formulation of Strong Cosmic Censorship by means of
oscillations.

turn out to be two key difficulties. In this paper, we present TransPose, a
DNN-based approach to perform full motion capture (with both global
translations and body poses) from only 6 Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) at
over 90 fps. For body pose estimation, we propose a multi-stage network that
estimates leaf-to-full joint positions as intermediate results. This design
makes the pose estimation much easier, and thus achieves both better accuracy
and lower computation cost. For global translation estimation, we propose a
supporting-foot-based method and an RNN-based method to robustly solve for the
global translations with a confidence-based fusion technique. Quantitative and
qualitative comparisons show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
learning- and optimization-based methods with a large margin in both accuracy
and efficiency. As a purely inertial sensor-based approach, our method is not
limited by environmental settings (e.g., fixed cameras), making the capture

neuromorphic computing applications. However, memristor devices suffer from
non-idealities that result in the variability of conductive states, making
programming them to a desired analog conductance value extremely difficult as
the device ages. In theory, memristors can be a nonlinear programmable analog
resistor with memory properties that can take infinite resistive states. In
practice, such memristors are hard to make, and in a crossbar, it is confined
to a limited set of stable conductance values. The number of conductance levels
available for a node in the crossbar is defined as the crossbar's resolution.
This paper presents a technique to improve the resolution by building a
super-resolution memristor crossbar with nodes having multiple memristors to
generate r-simplicial sequence of unique conductance values. The wider the
range and number of conductance values, the higher the crossbar's resolution.
This is particularly useful in building analog neural network (ANN) layers,
which are proven to be one of the go-to approaches for forming a neural network
layer in implementing neuromorphic computations.

understanding of climate evolution. The interplay among the different variables
acting over the climate is complex, often leading to correlations across long
spatial distances (teleconnections). In some occasions, those teleconnections
occur with quite significant temporal shifts that are fundamental for the
understanding of the underlying phenomena but which are poorly captured by
standard methods. Applying orthogonal decomposition such as Maximum Covariance
Analysis (MCA) to geophysical data sets allows to extract common dominant
patterns between two different variables, but generally suffers from (i) the
non-physical orthogonal constraint as well as (ii) the consideration of simple
correlations, whereby temporally offset signals are not detected. Here we
propose an extension, complex rotated MCA, to address both limitations. We
transform our signals using the Hilbert transform and perform the orthogonal
decomposition in complex space, allowing us to correctly correlate out-of-phase
signals. Subsequent Varimax rotation removes the orthogonal constraints,
leading to more physically meaningful modes of geophysical variability. As an
example of application, we have employed this method on sea surface temperature
and continental precipitation; our method successfully captures the temporal
and spatial interactions between these two variables, namely for (i) the
seasonal cycle, (ii) canonical ENSO, (iii) the global warming trend, (iv) the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation, (v) ENSO Modoki and finally (vi) the Atlantic
Meridional Mode. The complex rotated modes of MCA provide information on the
regional amplitude, and under certain conditions, the regional time lag between
changes on ocean temperature and land precipitation.

think of some characters $K[X]_{aug}\to K$ as algebraic structures with closed

categories, and not only in $Vec_K$. We show that every character $\chi :
K[X]_{aug}\to K$ arises from such a structure, by constructing a category
$C_{\chi}$ that is analogous to the universal construction from TQFT. We then
give necessary and sufficient conditions for a given character to arise from a
structure in an abelian category with finite dimensional hom-spaces. We call
such characters good characters. We show that if $\chi$ is good then $C_{\chi}$
is abelian and semisimple, and that the set of good characters forms a
K-algebra. This gives us a way to interpolate algebraic structures, and also
symmetric monoidal categories, in a way that generalizes Deligne's categories

the rigidity of the preexisting CRs below 50 TV by a mere factor of ~1.5.
Reaccelerated particles below ~0.5 TV are convected with the interstellar
medium (ISM) flow and do not reach the Sun, thus creating the bump. This single
universal process is responsible for the observed spectra of all CR species in
the rigidity range below 100 TV. We propose that one viable shock candidate is
the Epsilon Eridani star at 3.2 pc from the Sun, which is well-aligned with the
direction of the local magnetic field. Other shocks, such as old supernova
shells, may produce a similar effect. We provide a simple formula, Eq. (9),
that reproduces the spectra of all CR species with only two nonadjustable shock
parameters, uniquely derived from the proton data. We show how our formalism
predicts helium and carbon spectra and the B/C ratio.

video sequence provided several past frames thereof. It remains a challenging
domain as visual scenes evolve according to complex underlying dynamics, such

highly non-linear transformations between consecutive video frames. Therefore,
video prediction is of interest not only in anticipating visual changes in the
real world but has, above all, emerged as an unsupervised learning rule
targeting the formation and dynamics of the observed environment. Many of the
deep learning-based state-of-the-art models for video prediction utilize some
form of recurrent layers like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) or Gated Recurrent

future frames, they rely entirely on these recurrent structures to
simultaneously perform three distinct tasks: extracting transformations,
projecting them into the future, and transforming the current frame. In order
to completely interpret the formed internal representations, it is crucial to
disentangle these tasks. This paper proposes a fully differentiable building
block that can perform all of those tasks separately while maintaining
interpretability. We derive the relevant theoretical foundations and showcase
results on synthetic as well as real data. We demonstrate that our method is

high-mass clusters cannot be explained by the visible stellar population as
stars typically make up 3-20% of the total baryon mass. The independence of
metallicity of $M_*/M_{gas}$ suggests an external and universal source of
metals such as an early enrichment population (EEP). Galaxy cluster RX
J1416.4+2315, classified as a fosil system, has a stellar fraction of
$M_*/M_{gas}=0.054\pm0.018$, and here we improve the halo metallicity

the ICM metallicity of RXJ1416 to be $0.303\pm0.053$ $Z_\odot$ within
$0.3<R/R_{500}<1$, excluding the central galaxy. We combine this measurement

independent of $M_*/M_{gas}$, and shows that for a low $M_*/M_{gas}$ system,

quantify the Fe contribution of the EEP further by adopting a standard Fe yield
for visible stellar populations, and find that
$Z_{EEP}=(0.36\pm0.01)-(0.96\pm0.17)(M_*/M_{gas})$. To account for the observed

BaCeO$_3$, SrZrO$_3$, and BaZrO$_3$. The cerates require more carbon-poor
environments to prevent carbonate formation, though this requirement can be
loosened through the use of more oxygen-poor growth conditions. Carbonate
formation is not the only concern, however. We find that interstitial carbon
has lower formation energies in the cerates relative to the zirconates, leading
to higher carbon concentrations that compete with the desired oxygen vacancy
formation. We also examine the mobility of carbon interstitials, finding that
both migration barriers and binding energies to acceptors are lower in the
cerates. As a result, the cerates are likely to degrade when exposed to carbon
at operating temperatures. Our results show definitively why the cerates are
less stable than the zirconates with respect to carbon and elucidate the
mechanisms contributing to their instability, thereby helping to explain why
alloying with zirconium will enhance their operational efficiency.

range of neurological disorders, including epilepsy for localising
epileptogenic tissue. However, this identification may be challenging during
non-seizure (interictal) periods, especially if abnormalities are subtle
compared to the repertoire of possible healthy brain dynamics. Here, we
investigate if such interictal abnormalities become more salient by
quantitatively accounting for the range of healthy brain dynamics in a
location-specific manner. To this end, we constructed a normative map of brain
dynamics, in terms of relative band power, from interictal intracranial
recordings from 234 subjects (21,598 electrode contacts). We then compared
interictal recordings from 62 patients with epilepsy to the normative map to
identify abnormal regions. We hypothesised that if the most abnormal regions
were spared by surgery, then patients would be more likely to experience
continued seizures post-operatively. We first confirmed that the spatial
variations of band power in the normative map across brain regions were
consistent with healthy variations reported in the literature. Second, when
accounting for the normative variations, regions which were spared by surgery
were more abnormal than those resected only in patients with persistent
post-operative seizures (t=-3.6, p=0.0003), confirming our hypothesis. Third,
we found that this effect discriminated patient outcomes (AUC=0.75 p=0.0003).
Normative mapping is a well-established practice in neuroscientific research.
Our study suggests that this approach is feasible to detect interictal
abnormalities in intracranial EEG, and of potential clinical value to identify
pathological tissue in epilepsy. Finally, we make our normative intracranial

leads to a decrease in remanent polarization and an increase in coercive
voltage. Further, the applied voltage-driven polarization switching suggests
domain-nucleation dominant characteristics for low TDE, and domain-wall
motion-induced behavior for higher TDE. In addition, we show that the

These approaches have two major limitations: i) fairness is often achieved by
compromising accuracy for some groups; ii) the underlying relationship between

We introduce an Accelerated Smoothing Proximal Gradient Algorithm to solve the

achieving good prediction performance and across-group parity, in comparison
with the single fairness model, group-separate model, and group-ignorant model,
especially when the minority group's sample size is small. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of the JFM method in a real-world example to obtain

tasks are correlated and can reinforce each other. The grouping process will
refine the integrated representation of the corresponding entity, and the
linking process will give feedback to the grouping performance. For this

While retrieval models have continued to improve with the introduction of
increasingly complex architectures, few works have investigated a retrieval

capturing the model's uncertainty with respect to its own scoring of a document
is a critical aspect of retrieval that allows for greater use of current models
across new document distributions, collections, or even improving effectiveness
for down-stream tasks. In this paper, we address this problem via an efficient
Bayesian framework for retrieval models which captures the model's belief in
the relevance score through a stochastic process while adding only negligible
computational overhead. We evaluate this belief via a ranking based calibration
metric showing that our approximate Bayesian framework significantly improves a
retrieval model's ranking effectiveness through a risk aware reranking as well
as its confidence calibration. Lastly, we demonstrate that this additional
uncertainty information is actionable and reliable on down-stream tasks

excellent hydride kinetics, potentially surpassing those of other known hydride

observations can resolve chemical structures down to tens of AU. Molecular

all five disks. Lines of H$_2$CO and DCN are detected toward 2/5 and 1/5 disks,
respectively. For disks with resolved C$^{18}$O, C$_2$H, HCN, and H$_2$CO
emission, we observe substructures similar to those previously found in disks
around solar-type stars (e.g., rings, holes, and plateaus). C$_2$H and HCN
excitation conditions estimated interior to the pebble disk edge for the bright
disk J1100-7619 are consistent with previous measurements around solar-type
stars. The correlation previously found between C$_2$H and HCN fluxes for
solar-type disks extends to our M4-M5 disk sample, but the typical C$_2$H/HCN
ratio is higher for the M4-M5 disk sample. This latter finding is reminiscent
of the hydrocarbon enhancements found by previous observational infrared
surveys in the innermost ($<$10AU) regions of M-star disks, which is intriguing
since our disk-averaged fluxes are heavily influenced by flux levels in the
outermost disk, exterior to the pebble disk edge. Overall, most of the
observable chemistry at 10-100AU appears similar for solar-type and M4-M5

the fundamental problem posed by the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Bayesian
exploration strategies like Thompson Sampling resolve this trade-off in a

technique becomes infeasible for complex environments due to the computational
intractability of maintaining probability distributions over parameters of
outcome models of corresponding complexity. Moreover, the approximation
techniques introduced to mitigate this issue typically result in poor
exploration-exploitation trade-offs, as observed in the case of deep neural
network models with approximate posterior methods that have been shown to
underperform in the deep bandit scenario. In this paper we introduce Sample
Average Uncertainty (SAU), a simple and efficient uncertainty measure for
contextual bandits. While Bayesian approaches like Thompson Sampling estimate
outcomes uncertainty indirectly by first quantifying the variability over the
parameters of the outcome model, SAU is a frequentist approach that directly
estimates the uncertainty of the outcomes based on the value predictions.
Importantly, we show theoretically that the uncertainty measure estimated by
SAU asymptotically matches the uncertainty provided by Thompson Sampling, as
well as its regret bounds. Because of its simplicity SAU can be seamlessly
applied to deep contextual bandits as a very scalable drop-in replacement for
epsilon-greedy exploration. We confirm empirically our theory by showing that
SAU-based exploration outperforms current state-of-the-art deep Bayesian bandit
methods on several real-world datasets at modest computation cost. Code is

The stability of a pulsatile quasi-two-dimensional duct flow was numerically
investigated. Flow was driven, in concert, by a constant pressure gradient and
by the synchronous oscillation of the lateral walls. This prototypical setup
serves to aid understanding of unsteady magnetohydrodynamic flows in liquid
metal coolant ducts subjected to transverse magnetic fields, motivated by the
conditions expected in magnetic confinement fusion reactors. A wide range of
wall oscillation frequencies and amplitudes were simulated. Focus was placed on
the driving pulsation optimized for the greatest reduction in the critical
Reynolds number, for a range of friction parameters $H$ (proportional to
magnetic field strength). An almost $70$% reduction in the critical Reynolds
number, relative to that for the steady base flow, was obtained toward the
hydrodynamic limit ($H=10^{-7}$), while just over a $90$% reduction was
obtained by $H=10$. For all oscillation amplitudes, increasing $H$ consistently
led to an increasing percentage reduction in the critical Reynolds number. This
is a promising result, given fusion relevant conditions of $H \geq 10^4$. These
reductions were obtained by selecting a frequency that both ensures prominent
inflection points, and a growth in perturbation energy in phase with
deceleration of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations at the optimized frequency
and amplitude still satisfied the no net growth condition at the greatly
reduced critical Reynolds numbers. However, although the linear mode undergoes
a symmetry breaking process, turbulence was not triggered. Nonlinear base flow
modulation also arrested the linear decay of the perturbation, with exponential
growth not observed at supercritical Reynolds numbers.

Recently, the MR-INFORM randomised trial has demonstrated that the management
of patients with stable CAD can be guided by stress perfusion cardiovascular
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and it is non-inferior to the using the
invasive reference standard of fractional flow reserve. The benefits of using
stress perfusion CMR include that it is non-invasive and significantly reduces
the number of unnecessary coronary revascularisations. As compared to other
ischaemia tests, it boasts a high spatial resolution and does not expose the
patient to ionising radiation. However, the main limitation of stress perfusion
CMR is that the diagnostic accuracy is highly dependent on the level of
training of the operator, resulting in the test only being performed routinely
in experienced tertiary centres. The clinical translation of stress perfusion
CMR would be greatly aided by a fully automated, user-independent, quantitative
evaluation of myocardial blood flow. This thesis presents major steps towards
this goal: robust motion correction, automated image processing, reliable
quantitative modelling, and thorough validation. The motion correction scheme
makes use of data decomposition techniques, such as robust principal component
analysis, to mitigate the difficulties in image registration caused by the
dynamic contrast enhancement. The motion corrected image series are input to a
processing pipeline which leverages the recent advances in image processing
facilitated by deep learning. The pipeline utilises convolutional neural

important enablers for fifth-generation (5G) networks to deliver diverse
applications and services. Services are often provided as fully connected
virtual network functions (VNF)s, through service function chaining (SFC).
However, the problem of allocating SFC resources at the network edge still
faces many challenges related to the way VNFs are placed, chained and
scheduled. In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a game
theory-based approach with the objective to reduce service latency in the
context of SFC at the network edge. The problem of allocating SFC resources can
be divided into two subproblems. 1) The VNF placement and routing subproblem,
and 2) the VNF scheduling subproblem. For the former subproblem, we formulate
it as a mean field game (MFG) in which VNFs are modeled as entities contending
over edge resources with the goal of reducing the resource consumption of MEC
nodes and reducing latency for users. We propose a on a reinforcement
learning-based technique, where the Ishikawa-Mann learning algorithm (IMLA) is
used. For the later subproblem we formulate it as a matching game between the
VFNs and an edge resources in order to find the execution order of the VNFs
while reducing the latency. To efficiently solve it, we propose a modified
version of the many-to-one deferred acceptance algorithm (DAA), called the
enhanced multi-step deferred acceptance algorithm (eMSDA). To illustrate the
performance of the proposed approaches, we perform extensive simulations. The
obtained results show that the proposed approaches outperform the benchmarks

protocols, a widely-studied subclass of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) in
which all reactions have two reactants and two products. Each step in the
dynamics involves picking a uniform random pair from a population of $n$
molecules to collide and have a (potentially null) reaction. In a recent
breakthrough, Berenbrink, Hammer, Kaaser, Meyer, Penschuck, and Tran [ESA 2020]
discovered a population protocol simulation algorithm quadratically faster than
the naive algorithm, simulating $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ reactions in *constant* time
(independently of $n$, though the time scales with the number of species),
while preserving the *exact* stochastic dynamics.
  ppsim implements this algorithm, with a tightly optimized Cython
implementation that can exactly simulate hundreds of billions of reactions in
seconds. It dynamically switches to the CRN Gillespie algorithm for efficiency
gains when the number of applicable reactions in a configuration becomes small.
As a Python library, ppsim also includes many useful tools for data
visualization in Jupyter notebooks, allowing robust visualization of time
dynamics such as histogram plots at time snapshots and averaging repeated
trials.
  Finally, we give a framework that takes any CRN with only bimolecular (2
reactant, 2 product) or unimolecular (1 reactant, 1 product) reactions, with
arbitrary rate constants, and compiles it into a continuous-time population
protocol. This lets ppsim exactly sample from the chemical master equation
(unlike approximate heuristics such as tau-leaping or LNA), while achieving
asymptotic gains in running time. In linked Jupyter notebooks, we demonstrate
the efficacy of the tool on some protocols of interest in molecular
programming, including the approximate majority CRN and CRN models of DNA
strand displacement reactions.

planets as a function of the period and radius of Kepler-detectable planets.
About half ($0.52 \pm 0.03$) of the time, the detected planet is not the planet
with the largest semi-amplitude $K$ in the system, so efforts to measure the
mass of the transiting planet with radial velocity (RV) follow-up will have to
contend with additional planetary signals in the data. We simulate RV
observations to show that assuming a single-planet model to measure the $K$ of
the transiting planet often requires significantly more observations than in
the ideal case with no additional planets, due to the systematic errors from
unseen planet companions. Our results show that planets around 10-day periods
with $K$ close to the single-measurement RV precision ($\sigma_{1,\rm obs}$)
typically require $\sim 100$ observations to measure their $K$ to within 20%
error. For a next generation RV instrument achieving $\sigma_{1,\rm obs} = 10$
cm/s, about $\sim 200$ ($600$) observations are needed to measure the $K$ of a

terms of random walk models by analyzing local particle transitions. This is
because these models properly account for dynamic processes at the molecular
level and provide a clear physical picture. Recent theoretical studies made a
surprising discovery that in complex systems the symmetry of molecular
forward/backward transition times with respect to local bias in the dynamics
may be broken and it may take longer to go downhill than uphill. The physical
origins of these phenomena remain not fully understood. Here we explore in more
detail the microscopic features of the symmetry breaking in the
forward/backward transition times by analyzing exactly solvable discrete-state
stochastic models. In particular, we consider a specific case of two random
walkers on four-sites periodic lattice as the way to represent the general
systems with multiple pathways. It is found that the asymmetry in transition
times depends on several factors that include the degree of deviation from
equilibrium, the particle crowding and methods of measurements of dynamic
properties. Our theoretical analysis suggests that the asymmetry in transition
times can be explored experimentally for determining the important microscopic
features of natural processes by quantitative measuring the local deviations
from equilibrium and the degrees of crowding.

different levels of music structure, and controllability. In addition, more
application scenarios such as music therapy require imitating more specific
musical styles from a few given music examples, rather than capturing the
overall genre style of a large data corpus. To address requirements that
challenge current deep learning methods, we propose a statistical machine
learning model that is able to capture and imitate the structure, melody,
chord, and bass style from a given example seed song. An evaluation using 10
pop songs shows that our new representations and methods are able to create
high-quality stylistic music that is similar to a given input song. We also
discuss potential uses of our approach in music evaluation and music therapy.

from simulations of head-on collisions with a strongly centrally-condensed
initial density profile of $\rm \rho \propto R^{-2}$. We investigate the impact
of these density profiles on the overall evolution of the simulations: the
structures formed, their dynamical evolution, and their star formation
activity. We consider clouds which are globally bound and globally unbound,
leading to three different scenarios -- the collision of a bound cloud with a
bound cloud, the collision of two unbound clouds, or the collision of one cloud
of each type. In all the simulations dense star clusters form before the
collisions occur, and we find that star formation remains confined to these
systems and is little affected by the collisions. If the clouds' are both
initially bound, the collision forms a filamentary structure, but otherwise,
this does not occur. We observe that rotating structures form around the
clusters, but they also form in our non-colliding control simulations, so are
not a consequence of the collisions. Dissipation of kinetic energy in these
simulations is inefficient because of the substructure created in the clouds by
turbulence before the collisions. As a result, although some gas is left bound
in the COM frame, the star clusters formed in the simulations do not become
bound to each other.

controlled analytically nor computationally. A recent study [Biroli et al.

and then computationally evaluate both the threshold and its criticality in
various d. In high-d systems, we observe that the standard percolation physics

Waingarten (STOC 2018, FOCS 2018) has given approximate near neighbour search
(NNS) data structures for a wide class of distance metrics, including all
norms. In particular, these data structures achieve approximation on the order
of $p$ for $\ell_p^d$ norms with space complexity nearly linear in the dataset
size $n$ and polynomial in the dimension $d$, and query time sub-linear in $n$
and polynomial in $d$. The main shortcoming is the exponential in $d$
pre-processing time required for their construction.
  In this paper, we describe a more direct framework for constructing NNS data
structures for general norms. More specifically, we show via an algorithmic
reduction that an efficient NNS data structure for a given metric is implied by
an efficient average distortion embedding of it into $\ell_1$ or into Euclidean
space. In particular, the resulting data structures require only polynomial
pre-processing time, as long as the embedding can be computed in polynomial
time. As a concrete instantiation of this framework, we give an NNS data
structure for $\ell_p$ with efficient pre-processing that matches the
approximation factor, space and query complexity of the aforementioned data
structure of Andoni et al. On the way, we resolve a question of Naor (Analysis
and Geometry in Metric Spaces, 2014) and provide an explicit, efficiently
computable embedding of $\ell_p$, for $p \ge 2$, into $\ell_2$ with (quadratic)
average distortion on the order of $p$. We expect our approach to pave the way

it has been assumed that only those electronic states that have largest

transfer from labeled source domain to unlabeled target domain. Recently, many
domain adaptation (DA) methods use centroid to align the local distribution of
different domains, that is, to align different classes. This improves the
effect of domain adaptation, but domain differences exist not only between
classes, but also between samples. This work rethinks what is the alignment
between different domains, and studies how to achieve the real alignment
between different domains. Previous DA methods only considered one distribution
feature of aligned samples, such as full distribution or local distribution. In
addition to aligning the global distribution, the real domain adaptation should
also align the meso distribution and the micro distribution. Therefore, this
study propose a double classifier method based on high confidence label (DCP).
By aligning the centroid and the distribution between centroid and sample of
different classifiers, the meso and micro distribution alignment of different
domains is realized. In addition, in order to reduce the chain error caused by
error marking, This study propose a high confidence marking method to reduce
the marking error. To verify its versatility, this study evaluates DCP on
digital recognition and target recognition data sets. The results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most of the current domain

Porous-Fisher equations, support travelling wave solutions that are often
interpreted as simple mathematical models of biological invasion. Such
travelling wave solutions are thought to play a role in various applications
including development, wound healing and malignant invasion. One criticism of
these single-species equations is that they do not explicitly describe
interactions between the invading population and the surrounding environment.
In this work we study a reaction-diffusion equation that describes malignant
invasion which has been used to interpret experimental measurements describing
the invasion of malignant melanoma cells into surrounding human skin tissues.
This model explicitly describes how the population of cancer cells degrade the
surrounding tissues, thereby creating free space into which the cancer cells
migrate and proliferate to form an invasion wave of malignant tissue that is
coupled to a retreating wave of skin tissue. We analyse travelling wave
solutions of this model using a combination of numerical simulation, phase
plane analysis and perturbation techniques. Our analysis shows that the
travelling wave solutions involve a range of very interesting properties that
resemble certain well-established features of both the Fisher-KPP and
Porous-Fisher equations, as well as a range of novel properties that can be
thought of as extensions of these well-studied single-species equations. Of
particular interest is that travelling wave solutions of the invasion model are
very well approximated by trajectories in the Fisher-KPP phase plane that are
normally disregarded. This observation establishes a previously unnoticed link
between coupled multi-species reaction diffusion models of invasion and a
different class of models of invasion that involve moving boundary problems.

wavelength (1300-1500 nm suitable for long-distance transmission). The
teleportation uses entangled photon sources (i.e., non-degenerate two-mode
squeezed state) that can be generated by four-wave mixing in rubidium atomic
vapor cells, with a diamond configuration of atomic transitions. The entangled
fields can be emitted in two orthogonal polarizations with locked relative
phase, making them especially suitable for interfacing with single-photon
polarization qubits. Our work paves the way for the realization of

At ambient pressure, CrSiTe3 undergoes a paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase
transition at 32.8 K, with a negligible hysteresis loop, indicating a soft
ferromagnetic behaviour. Under 4.6 GPa pressure, the soft ferromagnet changes
into hard one, signalled by a rectangular hysteretic loop with remnant
magnetization at zero field. Interestingly, with further increasing pressure,
the coercive field (H_c) dramatically increases from 0.02 T at 4.6 GPa to 0.17
T at 7.8 GPa, and the Curie temperature (T_c^h: the temperature for closing the

influences of pressure on exchange interactions are further investigated by
density functional theory calculations, which reveal that the in-plane
nearest-neighbor exchange interaction and magneto-crystalline anisotropy

be a good idea to persuade critical users to stay active in the network and
prevent such a cascade because critical users can have significant influence on
user engagement of the whole network. Many user engagement studies have been
conducted to find a set of critical (anchored) users in the static social
network. However, social networks are highly dynamic and their structures are
continuously evolving. In order to fully utilize the power of anchored users in
evolving networks, existing studies have to mine multiple sets of anchored
users at different times, which incurs an expensive computational cost. To
better understand user engagement in evolving network, we target a new research

the anchored users at each timestamp of evolving networks. Nonetheless, it is
nontrivial to handle the AVT problem which we have proved to be NP-hard. To
address the challenge, we develop a greedy algorithm inspired by the previous

PV panel results in a decline in its performance which calls for an efficient
cooling mechanism that can offer an optimum output of the electrical power. In
the present numerical work, thermal management with a porous nanochannels
device capable to dissipate high heat flux is employed to regulate the
temperature of a commercial PV panel by integrating the device on the back face
of the panel. The spatial and temporal variation of the PV surface temperature
is obtained by solving the energy balance equation numerically. By evaluating
the steady-state PV surface temperature with and without thermal management,
the extent of cooling and the resulting enhancement in the electrical power
output is studied in detail. The nanochannels device is found to reduce the PV
surface temperature significantly with an average cooling of 31.5 oC.
Additionally, the enhancement in the electrical power output by ~33% and the
reduction in the response time to 1/8th highlight the potential of using porous
nanochannels as a thermal management device. Furthermore, the numerical method
is used to develop a universal curve which can predict the extent of PV cooling

distribution can be viewed as a joint distribution of clean images and noise,
the denoised images can be obtained via manipulating the latent representations

method to synthesize high-mobility epitaxial La-doped BaSnO3 films (mobility up
to 121 cm2V-1s-1 at the carrier density ~ 4.0 x 10^20 cm-3 at room temperature)
directly on SrTiO3 single crystal substrates using high-pressure magnetron
sputtering. The structural and electrical properties of the La-doped BaSnO3
films were characterized by combined high-resolution X-ray diffraction, X-ray
photoemission spectroscopy, and temperature-dependent electrical transport
measurements. The room temperature electron mobility of La-doped BaSnO3 films
in this work is 2 to 4 times higher than the reported values of the films grown
by magnetron sputtering. Moreover, in the high carrier density range (n > 3 x
10^20 cm-3), the electron mobility value of 121 cm2V-1s-1 in our work is among
the highest values for all reported doped BaSnO3 films. It is revealed that
high argon pressure during sputtering plays a vital role in stabilizing the
fully relaxed films and inducing oxygen vacancies, which benefit the high
mobility at room temperature. Our work provides an easy and economical way to
massively synthesize high-mobility transparent conducting films for transparent
electronics.

distributions $dN/dE_X \propto E_X^{-\alpha}$ is consistent with those of
optical/X-ray flaring from older stars and the Sun. Mega-flares ($\log(E_X) >
36.2$~erg) from solar-mass stars have occurrence rate of $1.7_{-0.6}^{+1.0}$
flares/star/year and contribute at least $10-20$\% to the total PMS X-ray

protoplanetary disk photoevaporation, ionization of disk gas, production of
spallogenic radionuclides in disk solids, and hydrodynamic escape of young

nature of the one-class problem: we can observe only positive examples. Most
conventional methods use a pairwise ranking approach and negative samplers to
cope with the one-class problem. However, such methods have two main drawbacks
particularly in large-scale applications; (1) the pairwise approach is severely
inefficient due to the quadratic computational cost; and (2) even recent
model-based samplers (e.g. IRGAN) cannot achieve practical efficiency due to
the training of an extra model.
  In this paper, we propose a learning-to-rank approach, which achieves
convergence speed comparable to the pointwise counterpart while performing
similarly to the pairwise counterpart in terms of ranking effectiveness. Our
approach estimates the probability densities of positive items for each user
within a rich class of distributions, viz. \emph{exponential family}. In our
formulation, we derive a loss function and the appropriate negative sampling
distribution based on maximum likelihood estimation. We also develop a
practical technique for risk approximation and a regularisation scheme. We then
discuss that our single-model approach is equivalent to an IRGAN variant under
a certain condition. Through experiments on real-world datasets, our approach
outperforms the pointwise and pairwise counterparts in terms of effectiveness

a sharp threshold such that exact recovery is achievable above the threshold

standard SBM and d-HSBM with two symmetric communities as special cases. En

conventional recommendation paradigm by embracing dialogue agents to

conversational recommendation scenario, a CRS firstly generates questions to
let the user clarify her/his demands and then makes suitable recommendations.
Hence, the ability to generate suitable clarifying questions is the key to
timely tracing users' dynamic preferences and achieving successful
recommendations. However, existing CRSs fall short in asking high-quality
questions because: (1) system-generated responses heavily depends on the
performance of the dialogue policy agent, which has to be trained with huge

fully utilize the learned latent user profiles for generating appropriate and

from previous conversational recommender systems, KBQG models a user's

from a structured knowledge graph (KG). Conditioned on the varied importance of
different relations, the generated clarifying questions could perform better in

training images. To boost the representation learning, different teacher graphs
are fused to provide the supervise signal for optimizing student networks. GCMT
fuses similarity relationships predicted by different teacher networks as

protocols of N95 respirators is validation that the entire N95 surface receives
the minimum acceptable dose. Photochromic indicators (PCIs) can accurately
measure UV-C dose on nonplanar surfaces, but often saturate below doses
required to decontaminate porous, multilayered textiles such as N95s. Here, we
investigate the use of optical attenuators to extend PCI dynamic range while
maintaining a near-ideal angular response - critical for accurate measurements
when UV-C is uncollimated. Through an analytical model, we show that tuning
attenuator refractive index, attenuation coefficient, and thickness can extend
dynamic range, but compromises ideal angular response unless the attenuator is
an ideal diffuser. To demonstrate this tradeoff empirically, we pair PCIs with
model specular (floated borosilicate) and diffuse (polytetrafluoroethylene)
attenuators, characterize the angular response, and evaluate on-N95 UV-C dose
measurement accuracy of each PCI-attenuator stack in a UV-C decontamination
system. While both borosilicate and polytetrafluoroethylene increase PCI
dynamic range >4$\times$, both attenuators introduce angle-dependent
transmittance, which causes location-dependent underestimation of UV-C dose.
The PCI-borosilicate and PCI-polytetrafluoroethylene stacks underreport true
on-N95 dose by 1) 14.7% and 3.6%, respectively, on a surface near-normal to the

approaches, the family of Embedding and Mapping methods for CDR (EMCDR) is very
effective, which explicitly learn a mapping function from source embeddings to
target embeddings with overlapping users. However, these approaches suffer from
one serious problem: the mapping function is only learned on limited
overlapping users, and the function would be biased to the limited overlapping
users, which leads to unsatisfying generalization ability and degrades the
performance on cold-start users in the target domain. With the advantage of
meta learning which has good generalization ability to novel tasks, we propose

are trained on source and target domains, respectively. In the meta stage, a
task-oriented meta network is learned to implicitly transform the user
embedding in the source domain to the target feature space. In addition, the
TMCDR is a general framework that can be applied upon various base models,

recommender systems. However, the embedding techniques are data demanding and
suffer from the cold-start problem. Especially, for the cold-start item which
only has limited interactions, it is hard to train a reasonable item ID
embedding, called cold ID embedding, which is a major challenge for the
embedding techniques. The cold item ID embedding has two main problems: (1) A
gap is existing between the cold ID embedding and the deep model. (2) Cold ID
embedding would be seriously affected by noisy interaction. However, most
existing methods do not consider both two issues in the cold-start problem,
simultaneously. To address these problems, we adopt two key ideas: (1) Speed up
the model fitting for the cold item ID embedding (fast adaptation). (2)
Alleviate the influence of noise. Along this line, we propose Meta Scaling and
Shifting Networks to generate scaling and shifting functions for each item,
respectively. The scaling function can directly transform cold item ID
embeddings into warm feature space which can fit the model better, and the
shifting function is able to produce stable embeddings from the noisy
embeddings. With the two meta networks, we propose Meta Warm Up Framework
(MWUF) which learns to warm up cold ID embeddings. Moreover, MWUF is a general
framework that can be applied upon various existing deep recommendation models.
The proposed model is evaluated on three popular benchmarks, including both
recommendation and advertising datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate its
superior performance and compatibility.

obscuring AGNs is amorphous olivine, the median mass column density of which is
one order of magnitude higher than those of the minor components of amorphous
pyroxene and crystalline forsterite. The median mass fraction of the amorphous
pyroxene, $\sim$2\%, is significantly lower than that of the diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM) dust in our Galaxy, while the median mass fraction of
the crystalline forsterite, $\sim$6\%, is higher than that of the diffuse ISM

crystalline forsterite positively correlate with each other. The low mass
fraction of the amorphous pyroxene suggests that the obscuring silicate dust is
newly formed, originating from starburst activities. The relatively high mass
fraction of crystalline forsterite implies that the silicate dust is processed
in the high temperature environment close to the nucleus and transported to
outer cooler regions by molecular outflows. The positive correlation between

popular Gaussian scale mixture prior distribution using Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) or its variants can be extremely slow or completely prohibitive
due to the heavy computational cost that grows in the cubic order of p, with p
as the number of features. Although a few recently developed algorithms make
the computation efficient in presence of a small to moderately large sample
size (with the complexity growing in the cubic order of n), the computation
becomes intractable when sample size n is also large. In this article we adopt
the data sketching approach to compress the n original samples by a random
linear transformation to m<<n samples in p dimensions, and compute Bayesian
regression with Gaussian scale mixture prior distributions with the randomly
compressed response vector and feature matrix. Our proposed approach yields
computational complexity growing in the cubic order of m. Another important
motivation for this compression procedure is that it anonymizes the data by
revealing little information about the original data in the course of analysis.
Our detailed empirical investigation with the Horseshoe prior from the class of
Gaussian scale mixture priors shows closely similar inference and a massive
reduction in per iteration computation time of the proposed approach compared
to the regression with the full sample. One notable contribution of this
article is to derive posterior contraction rate for high dimensional predictor
coefficient with a general class of shrinkage priors on them under data
compression/sketching. In particular, we characterize the dimension of the
compressed response vector m as a function of the sample size, number of
predictors and sparsity in the regression to guarantee accurate estimation of
predictor coefficients asymptotically, even after data compression.

statistical distributions of SAR images which can reveal physical properties of
terrain objects, into CNNs in a supervised feature learning framework. To
address this problem, a novel end-to-end supervised classification method is
proposed for HR SAR images by considering both spatial context and statistical
features. First, to extract more effective spatial features from SAR images, a
new deep spatial context encoder network (DSCEN) is proposed, which is a
lightweight structure and can be effectively trained with a small number of
samples. Meanwhile, to enhance the diversity of statistics, the nonstationary
joint statistical model (NS-JSM) is adopted to form the global statistical
features. Specifically, SAR images are transformed into the Gabor wavelet
domain and the produced multi-subbands magnitudes and phases are modeled by the
log-normal and uniform distribution. The covariance matrix is further utilized
to capture the inter-scale and intra-scale nonstationary correlation between
the statistical subbands and make the joint statistical features more compact
and distinguishable. Considering complementary advantages, a feature fusion
network (Fusion-Net) base on group compression and smooth normalization is
constructed to embed the statistical features into the spatial features and
optimize the fusion feature representation. As a result, our model can learn
the discriminative features and improve the final classification performance.
Experiments on four HR SAR images validate the superiority of the proposed
method over other related algorithms.

contributing factor to this difficulty is the non-intuitive nature of the GAN
loss curves, which necessitates a subjective evaluation of the generated output

been proposed as a domain agnostic measure to monitor GAN training. However, it
is restricted to the setting when the GAN converges to a Nash equilibrium. But
GANs need not always converge to a Nash equilibrium to model the data
distribution. In this work, we extend the notion of duality gap to proximal
duality gap that is applicable to the general context of training GANs where
Nash equilibria may not exist. We show theoretically that the proximal duality
gap is capable of monitoring the convergence of GANs to a wider spectrum of
equilibria that subsumes Nash equilibria. We also theoretically establish the
relationship between the proximal duality gap and the divergence between the

enabling a multitude of parties to construct a joint model without exposing

privacy, and robustness. The recently proposed SIGNSGD with majority vote shows
a promising direction to deal with efficiency and Byzantine robustness.
However, there is no guarantee that SIGNSGD is privacy-preserving. In this
paper, we bridge this gap by presenting an improved method called DP-SIGNSGD,

  $O(\sqrt{n})$",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of testing triangle freeness in the general graph model.
This problem was first studied in the general graph model by Alon et al. (SIAM
J. Discret. Math. 2008) who provided both lower bounds and upper bounds that
depend on the number of vertices and the average degree of the graph. Their
bounds are tight only when $d_{\rm max} = O(d)$ and $\bar{d} \leq \sqrt{n}$ or
when $\bar{d} = \Theta(1)$, where $d_{\rm max}$ denotes the maximum degree and
$\bar{d}$ denotes the average degree of the graph. In this paper we provide
bounds that depend on the arboricity of the graph and the average degree. As in
Alon et al., the parameters of our tester is the number of vertices, $n$, the
number of edges, $m$, and the proximity parameter $\epsilon$ (the arboricity of
the graph is not a parameter of the algorithm). The query complexity of our
tester is $\tilde{O}(\Gamma/\bar{d} + \Gamma)\cdot poly(1/\epsilon)$ on
expectation, where $\Gamma$ denotes the arboricity of the input graph (we use
$\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ to suppress $O(\log \log n)$ factors). We show that for
graphs with arboricity $O(\sqrt{n})$ this upper bound is tight in the following
sense. For any $\Gamma \in [s]$ where $s= \Theta(\sqrt{n})$ there exists a
family of graphs with arboricity $\Gamma$ and average degree $\bar{d}$ such
that $\Omega(\Gamma/\bar{d} + \Gamma)$ queries are required for testing
triangle freeness on this family of graphs. Moreover, this lower bound holds
for any such $\Gamma$ and for a large range of feasible average degrees.

approach is based on the Borel-Laplace integral regulated with the principal

general location of the singularities of the Borel transform and review the
properties of the corresponding expansions of the correlators. Unlike the
standard perturbative expansions, which are divergent, the modified expansions
have a tamed behaviour at large orders and may even converge under some
conditions. On the other hand, the expansion functions exhibit nonperturbative
features similar to those of the expanded function. Using these properties, it
was suggested recently that the expansions based on the conformal mapping of

aeroacoustic characteristics of jets issuing from twin rectangular nozzles with
an aspect ratio of 2:1 at two over-expanded conditions and the design
condition. For all three jet conditions simulated, LES predicts qualitatively
similar near-field flow statistics to those measured at the University of
Cincinnati. Using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings method, LES captures the
fundamental screech tone and its harmonics fairly well at multiple observer
locations in the far-field. Intense jet flapping motions in the near-field
along the minor axis, which are influenced by jet-to-jet interactions, are
found to correspond to those frequencies. Moreover, the predicted overall sound
pressure levels are within 1-2 dB of the experimental measurements. However,
the screech tones appear to be intermittent, as the twin-jet interaction
pattern varies irregularly. To extract dominant flow structures at the screech
frequencies and identify the twin-jet coupling modes, spectral proper
orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) analysis is used. SPOD analysis recovers
energetic peaks at the screech frequencies, and the corresponding leading modes
indicate strong upstream radiation originating from the fifth/sixth
shock-cells. For the two over-expanded conditions, the leading modes show
anti-symmetric coupling in the minor axis at the fundamental screech
frequencies. In contrast, the two jets behave symmetrically with respect to
each other in the major axis, in line with the absence of jet flapping in this
direction. Furthermore, the leading SPOD eigenvalues turn out to be, at least,
two orders of magnitude larger than higher-order eigenvalues, suggesting
potential of reduced-order models for the twin-jet screech.

physicists are interested in $6$-dimensional physics including the massless
field operators of higher spins on Lorentzian space $\Bbb R^{5,1}$. Its
Euclidean version $\mathscr{D}_0$ and their function theory are discussed in
\cite{wangkang3}. In this paper, we construct an exact sequence of Hilbert

$L^2_\varphi(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_{l})$ when $\mathscr{D}_{l+1} f=0$ for $f\in
L^2_{\varphi}(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_{l+1})$. This is proved by using the $L^2$
method in the theory of several complex variables, which is a general framework
to solve overdetermined PDEs under the compatibility condition. To apply this
method here, it is necessary to consider weighted $L^2$ spaces, an advantage of
which is that any polynomial is $L^2_{\varphi}$ integrable. As a corollary, we
prove that $$ P(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_0)\overset{\mathscr{D}_0}\longrightarrow

(WPT) systems, where each antenna at the energy harvesting (EH) nodes is
connected to a dedicated non-linear rectifier. We propose an optimal transmit
strategy which maximizes a weighted sum of the average harvested powers at the
EH nodes under a constraint on the power budget of the transmitter. First, for
multiple-input single-output (MISO) WPT systems, we show that it is optimal to
transmit scalar symbols with an arbitrary phase and an amplitude, whose
probability density function (pdf) has at most two mass points, using maximum
ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming. Then, we prove that for single-input
multiple-output (SIMO) WPT systems, the optimal transmit symbol amplitudes are
discrete random variables, whose pdf also has no more than two mass points. For
general multi-user MIMO WPT systems, we show that the optimal transmit strategy
involves scalar unit-norm symbols with arbitrary phase and at most two
beamforming vectors. In order to determine these vectors, we formulate a
non-convex optimization problem and obtain an optimal solution based on
monotonic optimization. Since the computational complexity of the optimal
solution is high, we also propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm to
obtain a suboptimal solution, which achieves nearly optimal performance. Our
simulation results reveal that the proposed transmit strategy for multi-user
MIMO WPT systems outperforms two baseline schemes, which are based on a linear
EH model and a single beamforming vector, respectively. For a given transmit
power budget, we show that the harvested power saturates when increasing the
number of transmit antennas. Finally, we observe that the harvested power
region spanned by multiple EH nodes is convex and the power harvested at one EH
node can be traded for a higher harvested power at the other nodes.

Refining, which can further improve the adversarial transferability by
correcting useless gradients introduced by input diversity through multiple
transformations. Our method is generally applicable to many gradient-based
attack methods combined with input diversity. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the ImageNet dataset and our method can achieve an average

applications. In this paper, we focus on a more relaxed setting: the grounding
of relevant visual entities in a weakly supervised manner by training on the
VQA task alone. To address this problem, we propose a visual capsule module
with a query-based selection mechanism of capsule features, that allows the
model to focus on relevant regions based on the textual cues about visual
information in the question. We show that integrating the proposed capsule
module in existing VQA systems significantly improves their performance on the
weakly supervised grounding task. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on two state-of-the-art VQA systems, stacked NMN and MAC, on the

has been proposed as a tool to disentangle the particle production originated
from the soft and hard QCD processes in proton-proton (pp) collisions. $R_{\rm
T}$ is a useful quantity to study particle production in events with
exceptionally large or small activity in the transverse region with respect to
the event-averaged mean. Contrary to the expectations, the preliminary results
of the ALICE Collaboration indicate that, e.g., the proton-to-pion ratio does
not exhibit the characteristic enhancement at intermediate $p_{\rm T}$ in
events with large $R_{\rm T}$ with respect to minimum-bias pp collisions. In
this work, we investigate the origin of this effect using the PYTHIA 8 and
HERWIG 7 Monte Carlo event generators. The effect is a consequence of a
selection bias attributed to wide-angle gluon emissions which creates jets that
populate the transverse region. Therefore, we propose a modified version of
$R_{\rm T}$ in order to suppress its sensitivity to hard gluon Bremsstrahlung,
and enhance the sensitivity to soft Multiparton Interactions (MPI). This
approach could be useful in order to study the particle production in the
jet-like region as a function of MPI. The implementation of these ideas in data
will provide more insight into the production mechanisms of hadrons in
high-multiplicity pp collisions, and its connection with heavy-ion phenomena.

point clouds. Conventional adversarial attack takes place in the inference
stage, often fooling a model by perturbing samples. In contrast, backdoor
attack aims to implant triggers into a model during the training stage, such
that the victim model acts normally on the clean data unless a trigger is
present in a sample. This work follows a typical setting of clean-label
backdoor attack, where a few poisoned samples (with their content tampered yet
labels unchanged) are injected into the training set. The unique contributions
of MorphNet are two-fold. First, it is key to ensure the implanted triggers
both visually imperceptible to humans and lead to high attack success rate on
the point clouds. To this end, MorphNet jointly optimizes two objectives for
sample-adaptive poisoning: a reconstruction loss that preserves the visual
similarity between benign / poisoned point clouds, and a classification loss
that enforces a modern recognition model of point clouds tends to mis-classify
the poisoned sample to a pre-specified target category. This implicitly
conducts spectral separation over point clouds, hiding sample-adaptive triggers
in fine-grained high-frequency details. Secondly, existing backdoor attack
methods are mainly designed for image data, easily defended by some point cloud
specific operations (such as denoising). We propose a third loss in MorphNet
for suppressing isolated points, leading to improved resistance to
denoising-based defense. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on ModelNet40
and ShapeNetcorev2. Our proposed Poisoning MorphNet outstrips all previous
methods with clear margins.

(ConvQA) a very popular mechanism for user-system interaction. State-of-the-art
methods for ConvQA over knowledge graphs (KGs) can only learn from crisp
question-answer pairs found in popular benchmarks. In reality, however, such
training data is hard to come by: users would rarely mark answers explicitly as
correct or wrong. In this work, we take a step towards a more natural learning
paradigm - from noisy and implicit feedback via question reformulations. A
reformulation is likely to be triggered by an incorrect system response,
whereas a new follow-up question could be a positive signal on the previous
turn's answer. We present a reinforcement learning model, termed CONQUER, that
can learn from a conversational stream of questions and reformulations. CONQUER
models the answering process as multiple agents walking in parallel on the KG,
where the walks are determined by actions sampled using a policy network. This
policy network takes the question along with the conversational context as
inputs and is trained via noisy rewards obtained from the reformulation
likelihood. To evaluate CONQUER, we create and release ConvRef, a benchmark
with about 11k natural conversations containing around 205k reformulations.
Experiments show that CONQUER successfully learns to answer conversational
questions from noisy reward signals, significantly improving over a
state-of-the-art baseline.

Diffusion method and NIDS and perform a non-asymptotic convergence analysis. We
not only show that EDAS asymptotically achieves the same network independent
convergence rate as centralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for
minimizing strongly convex and smooth objective functions, but also
characterize the transient time needed for the algorithm to approach the
asymptotic convergence rate, which behaves as
$K_T=\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n}{1-\lambda_2}\right)$, where $1-\lambda_2$ stands
for the spectral gap of the mixing matrix. To the best of our knowledge, EDAS
achieves the shortest transient time when the average of the $n$ cost functions

this article, we study two such summaries, the Expected Persistence Diagram

be approximated by its empirical counterpart. We prove that this estimator is
optimal from a minimax standpoint on a large class of models with a parametric

excitations in spin systems, including molecular spin clusters. The method has
significantly advanced in recent years and now permits to probe the scattering
intensity as a function of the energy transfer and the momentum-transfer vector
Q. It was recently shown that high molecular symmetry facilitates the analysis
of spectra. Point-group symmetry imposes selection rules in isotropic as well
as anisotropic spin models. Furthermore, the Q-dependence of the INS intensity
may be completely determined by the point-group symmetry of the states involved
in a transition, thereby affording a clear separation of dynamics (energies,
transition strengths) and geometrical features (Q-dependencies). The present
work addresses this issue for anisotropic spin models. We identify a number of
cases where the Q-dependence is completely fixed by the point-group symmetry.
For six- and eight-membered planar spin rings and two polyhedra (the cube and
the icosahedron) we tabulate and plot the corresponding powder-averaged
universal intensity functions. The outlined formalism straightforwardly applies
to other highly-symmetric systems and should be useful for future analyses of
INS spectra by focusing on those features that contain information on either
spin dynamics or the point-group symmetry of states.

shortest stave of PW lasers up to now, as to manufacture a high quality
meter-sized grating remains particularly challenging. Here, the asymmetric
four-grating compressor (AFGC) with asymmetric configuration is proposed for PW
lasers to increase the maximum bearable output pulse energy and running safety
without neither additional optical component nor extra control in comparison to
a traditional Treacy four-grating compressor (TFGC) with symmetric

output laser beam which is able to decrease the laser spatial intensity
modulation (LSIM) of the output beam on the final grating. The introduced
spatial dispersion can be automatically compensated at the focal plane by using
the spatiotemporal focusing technique. Based on this simple AFGC design, not
only the damage risk of the final grating can be reduced, but also the maximum
output pulse energy can be improved by about 1.8 times theoretically. As an
example, 100 PW output power can be achieved theoretically by using the AFGC

giant stars belonging to individual clusters with the predictions of a set of
classical models and of models with mixing induced by rotation and thermohaline
instability. The comparison with stellar evolution models confirms that
classical models cannot reproduce the lithium abundances observed in the
metallicity and mass regimes covered by the data. The models that include the
effects of both rotation-induced mixing and thermohaline instability account
for the Li abundance trends observed in our sample, in all metallicity and mass

revolutionizing information processing and computing. As such, quantum
computers use physical quantum gates that process information unitarily, even
though the final computing steps might be measurement-based or non-unitary. The
applications of quantum computers cover diverse areas, reaching from well-known
quantum algorithms to quantum machine learning and quantum neural networks. The
last of these is of particular interest by belonging to the promising field of
artificial intelligence. However, quantum neural networks are technologically
challenging as the underlying computation requires non-unitary operations for
mimicking the behavior of neurons. A landmark development for classical neural
networks was the realization of memory-resistors, or ""memristors"". These are
passive circuit elements that keep a memory of their past states in the form of
a resistive hysteresis and thus provide access to nonlinear gate operations.
The quest for realising a quantum memristor led to a few proposals, all of
which face limited technological practicality. Here we introduce and
experimentally demonstrate a novel quantum-optical memristor that is based on
integrated photonics and acts on single photons. We characterize its memristive
behavior and underline the practical potential of our device by numerically
simulating instances of quantum reservoir computing, where we predict an
advantage in the use of our quantum memristor over classical architectures.

essential to draw decisive conclusions and engineering studies, e.g.,
optimizing a process. Experimental data availability notwithstanding has
increased significantly, but interpretable and explainable models in science
and engineering yet remain incomprehensible. In this work, we blend machine
learning and dictionary-based learning with numerical analysis tools to
discover governing differential equations from noisy and sparsely-sampled
measurement data. We utilize the fact that given a dictionary containing huge
candidate nonlinear functions, dynamical models can often be described by a few
appropriately chosen candidates. As a result, we obtain interpretable and
parsimonious models which are prone to generalize better beyond the sampling
regime. Additionally, we integrate a numerical integration framework with
dictionary learning that yields differential equations without requiring or
approximating derivative information at any stage. Hence, it is utterly
effective in corrupted and sparsely-sampled data. We discuss its extension to
governing equations, containing rational nonlinearities that typically appear
in biological networks. Moreover, we generalized the method to governing
equations that are subject to parameter variations and externally controlled
inputs. We demonstrate the efficiency of the method to discover a number of
diverse differential equations using noisy measurements, including a model
describing neural dynamics, chaotic Lorenz model, Michaelis-Menten Kinetics,
and a parameterized Hopf normal form.

pulses reported so far were limited to a few picoseconds with some hundreds of
milliwatts of peak power, strongly narrowing their applicability for
time-resolved and nonlinear experiments. Here, we demonstrate an alternative
approach capable of producing near-transform-limited sub-picosecond pulses with
several watts of peak power. Starting from a frequency modulated phase-locked

ultrashort high peak power pulses are generated via external pulse compression.
We assess their temporal nature by means of a novel optical sampling method,
coherent beat note interferometry and interferometric autocorrelation. These
results open new pathways for nonlinear physics in the mid-infrared.

extended lead-time up to 2-3 weeks. This is tested in a version of operational
extended range forecasts based on Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2)
developed at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune. Forecast
skills are assessed to understand the role of initial errors on the prediction
skill for MJO. A set of lowest and highest initial day error (LIDE & HIDE)
cases are defined and the error-growth for these categories are analysed for
the strong MJO events during May to September (MJJAS). The MJO forecast initial
errors are categorized and defined using the well-known multivariate MJO index
introduced by Wheeler &Hendon (2004). The probability distribution of bivariate
RMSE and error growth evolution (first order difference of index error for each
successive lead days) with respect to extended range lead-time are used as
metrics in this analysis. The result showed that initial error is not showing
any influence in the skill of model after a lead time of 7-10 days and the
error growth remains the same for both set of errors. A rapid error growth
evolution of same order is seen for both the classified cases. Further the
physical attribution of these errors is studied and found that the errors
originate from the events with initial phase in Western Pacific and Indian
Ocean. The spatial distribution of OLR and the zonal winds also confirms the
same. The study emphasises the importance of better representation of MJO
phases especially over Indian ocean in the model to improve the MJO prediction

pyramid-based modules, i.e., the pyramid progressive transfer (PPT) module and
the pyramid self-attention (PSA) module, as the main components of the proposed

transfers both self- and cross-scale similarity information from the same
degraded image in a progressive manner. Then, the PSA module fuses the above
transferred features for subsequent restoration using self- and
spatial-attention mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing solutions for blurry image super-resolution

is of increasing interest while micropollutants in sludge are of concern to the

liquefaction (HTL) of sewage sludge in a continuous flow pilot scale reactor at
conditions expected to reflect future industrial installations. The processing
is evaluated in terms of energy efficiency, bio-crude yields and quality. The
raw sludge and post-HTL process water and solid residues were analyzed
extensively for micropollutants via HPLC-MS/MS for target pharmaceuticals
including antibiotics, blood pressure medicine, antidepressants, analgesics,
x-ray contrast media, angiotensin II receptor blockers, immunosuppressant drugs
and biocides including triazines, triazoles, carbamates, a carboxamide, an
organophosphate and a cationic surfactant. The results show that a positive
energy return on investment was achieved for all three HTL processing
temperatures of 300, 325 and 350 {\deg}C with the most beneficial temperature
identified as 325 {\deg}C. The analysis of the HTL by-products, process water
and solids, indicates that HTL is indeed a suitable technology for the
destruction of micropollutants. However, due to the large matrix effect of the
HTL process water it can only be stated with certainty that 9 out of 30
pharmaceuticals and 5 out of 7 biocides products were destroyed successfully
(over 98% removal). One compound, the antidepressant citalopram, was shown to
be moderately recalcitrant at 300 {\deg}C with 87% removal and was only
destroyed at temperatures $\geq$325 {\deg}C ($>$99% removal). Overall, the
results suggest that HTL is a suitable technology for energy efficient and
value added sewage sludge treatment enabling destruction of micropollutants.

follows the expectation of jets fragmenting in vacuum. On the other hand, this

this way to Heisenberg couplings that are $\lesssim$45\% to$\lesssim$63\%

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in the region of 15\% of the Heisenberg

interaction and single-ion magnetocrystalline anisotropy successfully reproduce
the magnon dispersion obtained by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
measurements. In particular, the spin-wave gap fully agrees with the measured

the single-ion anisotropy, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange and the symmetric
anisotropic exchange interactions. The results reported here underpin the
local-moment description of NaOsO$_3$, when it comes to analyzing the magnetic

its 86-string configuration. As fermionic dark matter does not scatter off
nucleons due to its singlet nature and therefore does not accumulate in the
Sun, we study the case of scalar dark matter with a scan over the parameter
space. Due to a naturally small mass splitting between the two neutral scalar
components, inelastic scattering processes with nucleons can occur. We find
that for most of the parameter space, i.e. for mass splittings below 500 keV,
inelastic scattering in the Sun yields IceCube event rates above 10 events per
year, whereas direct detection on Earth is sensitive only to 250 keV.
Consequently, a detailed analysis with IceCube could lead to a lower limit on
the scalar coupling $\lambda_5\gtrsim1.6\cdot10^{-5}\cdot m_{DM}$/TeV. For
larger mass splittings, only elastic scattering occurs in the Sun. In this
case, XENON1T limits only allow for models with expected event rates of up to
O(0.1) per year. Some of these models, in particular those with large DM mass
and fermion coannihilation, could also be tested with a dedicated IceCube

function $\xi$ adapted to an orientation $Q$ of the Dynkin diagram of
$\mathfrak{g}$, Hernandez-Leclerc introduced a certain category
$\mathcal{C}^{\leq \xi}$ of representations of the quantum affine algebra
$U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$, as well as a subcategory $\mathcal{C}_Q$ of
$\mathcal{C}^{\leq \xi}$ whose complexified Grothendieck ring is isomorphic to
the coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{N}]$ of a maximal unipotent subgroup.
In this paper, we define an algebraic morphism $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ on a torus
$\mathcal{Y}^{\leq \xi}$ containing the image of $K_0(\mathcal{C}^{\leq \xi})$
under the truncated $q$-character morphism. We prove that the restriction of
$\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ to $K_0(\mathcal{C}_Q)$ coincides with the morphism
$\overline{D}$ recently introduced by Baumann-Kamnitzer-Knutson in their study
of equivariant multiplicities of Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen cycles. This is achieved
using the T-systems satisfied by the characters of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules
in $\mathcal{C}_Q$, as well as certain results by Brundan-Kleshchev-McNamara on
the representation theory of quiver Hecke algebras. This alternative
description of $\overline{D}$ allows us to prove a conjecture by the first
author on the distinguished values of $\overline{D}$ on the flag minors of
$\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{N}]$. We also provide applications of our results from the
perspective of Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh's generalized Schur-Weyl duality. Finally,
we define a cluster algebra $\overline{\mathcal{A}}_Q$ as a subquotient of
$K_0(\mathcal{C}^{\leq \xi})$ naturally containing $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{N}]$,
and suggest the existence of an analogue of the Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen basis in

interpreted as certain equivariant multiplicities.

function, i.e. the gradient of the log-likelihood function with respect to
parameters, with no time-discretization bias. These estimators can be
straightforwardly employed within stochastic gradient methods to perform
maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian inference. As our proposed
methodology only requires access to a time-discretization scheme such as the
Euler-Maruyama method, it is applicable to a wide class of diffusion processes
and observation models. Our approach is based on a representation of the score
as a smoothing expectation using Girsanov theorem, and a novel adaptation of
the randomization schemes developed in Mcleish [2011], Rhee and Glynn [2015],
Jacob et al. [2020a]. This allows one to remove the time-discretization bias
and burn-in bias when computing smoothing expectations using the conditional
particle filter of Andrieu et al. [2010]. Central to our approach is the
development of new couplings of multiple conditional particle filters. We prove
under assumptions that our estimators are unbiased and have finite variance.
The methodology is illustrated on several challenging applications from

As these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is
thus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods
directly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,
which ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the
performance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for

redefine the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration

expensive on-chain verification to the orchestration of off-chain VM (virtual
machine) execution and on-chain arbitration with the pinpoint protocol. The
representative projects are TrueBit, Arbitrum, YODA, ACE, and Optimism.
Inspired by visionaries in academia and industry, we consider the DNN
computation to be promising but on the next level of complexity for the
verification paradigm of smart contract. Unfortunately, even for the
state-of-the-art verification paradigm, off-chain VM execution of DNN
computation has an orders-of-magnitude slowdown compared to the native
off-chain execution.
  To enable the native off-chain execution of verifiable DNN computation, we
present Agatha system, which solves the significant challenges of misalignment
and inconsistency: (1) Native DNN computation has a graph-based computation
paradigm misaligned with previous VM-based execution and arbitration; (2)
Native DNN computation may be inconsistent cross platforms which invalidates
the verification paradigm. In response, we propose the graph-based pinpoint
protocol (GPP) which enables the pinpoint protocol on computational graphs, and
bridges the native off-chain execution and the contract arbitration. We also
develop a technique named Cross-evaluator Consistent Execution (XCE), which
guarantees cross-platform consistency and forms the correctness foundation of
GPP. We showcase Agatha for the DNN computation of popular models (MobileNet,
ResNet50 and VGG16) on Ethereum. Agatha achieves a negligible on-chain
overhead, and an off-chain execution overhead of 3.0%, which represents an
off-chain latency reduction of at least 602x compared to the state-of-the-art

of conditional SI is to make the inference conditional on the selection event,
which enables an exact and valid statistical inference to be conducted even
when the hypothesis is selected based on the data. Conditional SI has mainly
been studied in the context of model selection, such as vanilla lasso or
generalized lasso. The main limitation of existing approaches is the low
statistical power owing to over-conditioning, which is required for
computational tractability. In this study, we propose a more powerful and
general conditional SI method for a class of problems that can be converted
into quadratic parametric programming, which includes generalized lasso. The
key concept is to compute the continuum path of the optimal solution in the
direction of the selected test statistic and to identify the subset of the data
space that corresponds to the model selection event by following the solution
path. The proposed parametric programming-based method not only avoids the
aforementioned major drawback of over-conditioning, but also improves the
performance and practicality of SI in various respects. We conducted several

Melli\`es defines sequential and concurrent games as categories with positions

higher and advocate that template games should not be just defined as
1-dimensional categories but as 2-dimensional categories of positions,
trajectories and reshufflings (or reschedulings) as 2-cells. In order to
achieve the purpose, we take seriously the parallel between asynchrony in
concurrency and the Gray tensor product of 2-categories. One technical
difficulty on the way is that the category S=2-Cat of small 2-categories
equipped with the Gray tensor product is monoidal, and not cartesian. This
prompts us to extend the framework of template games originally formulated by
Melli\`es in a category S with finite limits, and to upgrade it in the style of
Aguiar's work on quantum groups to the more general situation of a monoidal
category S with coreflexive equalizers, preserved by the tensor product
componentwise. We construct in this way an asynchronous template game semantics
of multiplicative additive linear logic (MALL) where every formula and every

human-computer interaction, etc., and negative applications such as DeepFake
threats to politics, economics, etc. Nevertheless, it is necessary to
understand the scheme of advanced methods for high-quality face swapping and
generate enough and representative face swapping images to train DeepFake
detection algorithms. This paper proposes the first Megapixel level method for
one shot Face Swapping (or MegaFS for short). Firstly, MegaFS organizes face
representation hierarchically by the proposed Hierarchical Representation Face
Encoder (HieRFE) in an extended latent space to maintain more facial details,
rather than compressed representation in previous face swapping methods.
Secondly, a carefully designed Face Transfer Module (FTM) is proposed to
transfer the identity from a source image to the target by a non-linear
trajectory without explicit feature disentanglement. Finally, the swapped faces
can be synthesized by StyleGAN2 with the benefits of its training stability and
powerful generative capability. Each part of MegaFS can be trained separately
so the requirement of our model for GPU memory can be satisfied for megapixel
face swapping. In summary, complete face representation, stable training, and
limited memory usage are the three novel contributions to the success of our
method. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MegaFS and the
first megapixel level face swapping database is released for research on
DeepFake detection and face image editing in the public domain. The dataset is

multi-point dynamic aggregation (MPDA) problem, has become one of the active
research topics of the multi-robot system. This paper focuses on a
multi-objective MPDA problem which is to design an execution plan of the robots
to minimise the number of robots and the maximal completion time of all the
tasks. The strongly-coupled relationships among robots and tasks, the
redundancy of the MPDA encoding, and the variable-size decision space of the
MO-MPDA problem posed extra challenges for addressing the problem effectively.
To address the above issues, we develop a hybrid decomposition-based
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (HDMOEA) using $ \varepsilon
$-constraint method. It selects the maximal completion time of all tasks as the
main objective, and converted the other objective into constraints. HDMOEA
decomposes a MO-MPDA problem into a series of scalar constrained optimization
subproblems by assigning each subproblem with an upper bound robot number. All
the subproblems are optimized simultaneously with the transferring knowledge
from other subproblems. Besides, we develop a hybrid population initialisation
mechanism to enhance the quality of initial solutions, and a reproduction
mechanism to transmit effective information and tackle the encoding redundancy.
Experimental results show that the proposed HDMOEA method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of several most-used metrics.

$N$-subjettiness observable for track-based jets in heavy-ion collisions. This
study is performed using data recorded in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions at
centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} =
2.76$\,TeV, respectively. In particular the ratio of 2-subjettiness to
1-subjettiness, $\tau_{2}/\tau_{1}$, which is sensitive to the rate of
two-pronged jet substructure, is presented. Energy loss of jets traversing the
strongly interacting medium in heavy-ion collisions is expected to change the
rate of two-pronged substructure relative to vacuum. The results are presented
for jets with a resolution parameter of $R = 0.4$ and charged jet transverse
momentum of $40 \leq p_{\rm T,\rm jet} \leq 60$ GeV/$c$, which constitute a
larger jet resolution and lower jet transverse momentum interval than previous
measurements in heavy-ion collisions. This has been achieved by utilising a
semi-inclusive hadron-jet coincidence technique to suppress the larger jet
combinatorial background in this kinematic region. No significant modification
of the $\tau_{2}/\tau_{1}$ observable for track-based jets in Pb--Pb collisions
is observed relative to vacuum PYTHIA6 and PYTHIA8 references at the same
collision energy. The measurements of $\tau_{2}/\tau_{1}$, together with the
splitting aperture angle $\Delta R$, are also performed in pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV for inclusive jets. These results are compared with PYTHIA
calculations at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, in order to validate the model as a vacuum
reference for the Pb$-$Pb centre-of-mass energy. The PYTHIA references for
$\tau_{2}/\tau_{1}$ are shifted to larger values compared to the measurement in
pp collisions. This hints at a reduction in the rate of two-pronged jets in
Pb--Pb collisions compared to pp collisions.

DIA and CSR formats, so-called the HDC format. First, we recall the importance
of introducing cache blocking techniques into HDC-based SpMV kernels. Next,
based on the observation of the cache blocked kernel, we present a modified
version of the HDC formats, which we call the M-HDC format, in which partial
diagonal structures are expected to be more efficiently picked up. For these
SpMV kernels, we theoretically analyze the expected performance improvement
based on performance models. Then, we conduct comprehensive experiments on
state-of-the-art multi-core CPUs. By the experiments using typical matrices, we
clarify the detailed performance characteristics of each SpMV kernel. We also
evaluate the performance for matrices appearing in practical applications and
demonstrate that our approach can accelerate SpMV for some of them. Through the
present paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting partial diagonal
structures by the M-HDC format as a promising approach to accelerating SpMV on
CPUs for a certain kind of practical sparse matrices.

measurements are carried out in magnetic fields on the triangular lattice
compound $\rm Lu_3Cu_2Sb_3O_{14}$. We show that the obtained heat capacity
$C_{\rm mag}/T$ formed by ultra spin liquid as a function of temperature $T$
versus magnetic field $B$ behaves very similar to the electronic specific heat
$C_{el}/T$ of the heavy fermion (HF) metal $\rm YbRh_2Si_2$ and that of the
quantum magnet $\rm ZnCu_3(OH)_6Cl_2$. We further demonstrate that the spinon
effective mass $M^*\propto C_{\rm mag}/T$ exhibits the universal scaling
coinciding with that observed in HF metals and in $\rm ZnCu_3(OH)_6Cl_2$. Based
on these observations we conclude that a strongly correlated spin liquid
determines the thermodynamic properties of the ultra spin liquid of $\rm

environmental parameters, e.g., temperature, pH, or salt concentration.
Furthermore, microgels readily adsorb to liquid-gas and liquid-liquid
interfaces forming responsive foams and emulsions that can be broken on-demand.
In this work, we explore the interactions between microgel monolayers at the
air-water interface and a hard colloid in the water. Force-distance curves
between the monolayer and a silica particle were measured with the Monolayer
Particle Interaction Apparatus. The measurements were conducted at different
temperatures and lateral compression, i.e., different surface pressures. The
force-distance approach curves display long-range repulsive forces below the
volume phase transition temperature of the microgels. Temperature and lateral
compression reduce the stiffness of the monolayer. The adhesion increases with
temperature and decreases with a lateral compression of the monolayer. When
compressed laterally, the interactions between the microgels are hardly
affected by temperature, as the directly adsorbed microgel fractions are nearly
insensitive to temperature. In contrast, our findings show that the
temperature-dependent swelling of the microgel fractions in the aqueous phase
strongly influences the interaction with the probe. The microgel monolayer
changes from a soft to a hard repulsive interface.

evolution reaction (HER). However, further enhancement of the photocatalytic
activity in this material could be envisaged through the effective control of
oxygen vacancy states. This could substantially tune the photoexcited charge
carrier trapping under the influence of elemental functionalization in SrTiO3,
corresponding to the defect formation energy. The charge trapping states in
SrTiO3 decrease through the substitutional doping in Ti sites with p-block
elements like Aluminium (Al) with respect to the relative oxygen vacancies.
With the help of electronic structure calculations based on density functional
theory (DFT) formalism, we have explored the synergistic effect of doping with
both Al and Iridium (Ir) in SrTiO3 from the perspective of defect formation
energy, band edge alignment and the corresponding charge carrier recombination
probability to probe the photoexcited charge carrier trapping that primarily
governs the photocatalytic water splitting process. We have also systematically
investigated the ratio-effect of Ir:Al functionalization on the position of
acceptor levels lying between Fermi and conduction band in oxygen deficient
SrTiO3, which governs the charge carrier recombination and therefore the

defined services and tools. However, previous research has revealed API misuses
that violate the contract of APIs to be prevalent. Such misuses can have
harmful consequences, especially in the context of cryptographic libraries.
Various API misuse detectors have been proposed to address this issue including
CogniCrypt, one of the most versatile of such detectors and that uses a
language CrySL to specify cryptographic API usage contracts. Nonetheless,
existing approaches to detect API misuse had not been designed for systematic
reuse, ignoring the fact that different versions of a library, different
versions of a platform, and different recommendations or guidelines might
introduce variability in the correct usage of an API. Yet, little is known
about how such variability impacts the specification of the correct API usage.
This paper investigates this question by analyzing the impact of various
sources of variability on widely used Java cryptographic libraries including
JCA, Bouncy Castle, and Google Tink. The results of our investigation show that
sources of variability like new versions of the API and security standards
significantly impact the specifications. We then use the insights gained from
our investigation to motivate an extension to the CrySL language named
MetaCrySL, which builds on meta programming concepts. We evaluate MetaCrySL by
specifying usage rules for a family of Android versions and illustrate that
MetaCrySL can model all forms of variability we identified and drastically
reduce the size of a family of specifications for the correct usage of
cryptographic APIs

phenomenon of diquark condensation and phase structure of dense quark matter
altogether is contemplated in the framework of effective two-color and
two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We show that the duality relations, found
$\mu_5=0$, are also valid for any value of $\mu_5\neq0$. Hence the dualities
seem to be a real fundamental feature of the phase diagram of two color quark
matter, and besides they are a very powerful tool of studying the phase
structure. In terms of dualities and the influence on the phase diagram chiral
imbalance $\mu_5$ stands alone from other chemical potentials. Two regimes in
the phase diagram could be discerned, the first one, rather small or moderate
values of chemical potentials $\mu_B$, $\mu_I$ and $\mu_{I5}$, where the
picture is rather concise and elegant: each of the above phenomena is in
one-to-one correspondence with some chemical potential ($\mu_{I5}$ induces
chiral symmetry breaking, $\mu_I$ propels charged pion condensation and $\mu_B$
leads to diquark condensation). In this regime chiral chemical potential
$\mu_5$ does not break this correspondence, it has a property of being
universal catalyzer, i.e. it {\it catalyzes/enhances} all the phenomena on
equal footing. The feature of chiral imbalance $\mu_5$ to catalyze chiral
symmetry breaking phenomenon was known before but its catalytic properties
appeared to be more universal and it can catalyze also diquark and charged pion
condensation. These happen due to the dual properties. In the second regime,
when several chemical potentials reach rather large values, one could observe a
rather complicated and rich phase structure, and $\mu_5$ can be a factor that
not so much catalyzes as {\it triggers} rather peculiar phases. For example, it
can lead to the formation of diquark condensation at zero baryon chemical
potential.

  2021",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The risk of re-offense is considered in decision-making at many stages of the
criminal justice system, from pre-trial, to sentencing, to parole. To aid
decision makers in their assessments, institutions increasingly rely on
algorithmic risk assessment instruments (RAIs). These tools assess the
likelihood that an individual will be arrested for a new criminal offense
within some time window following their release. However, since not all crimes
result in arrest, RAIs do not directly assess the risk of re-offense.
Furthermore, disparities in the likelihood of arrest can potentially lead to
biases in the resulting risk scores. Several recent validations of RAIs have
therefore focused on arrests for violent offenses, which are viewed as being
more accurate reflections of offending behavior. In this paper, we investigate
biases in violent arrest data by analysing racial disparities in the likelihood
of arrest for White and Black violent offenders. We focus our study on
2007--2016 incident-level data of violent offenses from 16 US states as
recorded in the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Our analysis
shows that the magnitude and direction of the racial disparities depend on
various characteristics of the crimes. In addition, our investigation reveals
large variations in arrest rates across geographical locations and offense
types. We discuss the implications of the observed disconnect between re-arrest
and re-offense in the context of RAIs and the challenges around the use of data
from NIBRS to correct for the sampling bias.

as a sum of policies. However, these policies are independent of each other and
thus, they can have conflicting behaviors when summing their contributions
together. We introduce Composable Energy Policies (CEP), a novel framework for
modular reactive motion generation. CEP computes the control action by
optimization over the product of a set of stochastic policies. This product of
policies will provide a high probability to those actions that satisfy all the
components and low probability to the others. Optimizing over the product of
the policies avoids the detrimental effect of conflicting behaviors between
policies choosing an action that satisfies all the objectives. Besides, we show
that CEP naturally adapts to the Reinforcement Learning problem allowing us to
integrate, in a hierarchical fashion, any distribution as prior, from
multimodal distributions to non-smooth distributions and learn a new policy
given them.

boosted with high spectral resolution. For integral field spectrographs
yielding hyperspectral data, this means that the field of view consists of
diffracted starlight spectra and a spatially localized planet. Analysis usually
relies on cross-correlation with theoretical spectra. In a purely blind-search
context, this supervised strategy can be biased with model mismatch and/or be
computationally inefficient. Using an approach that is inspired by the
remote-sensing community, we aim to propose an alternative to cross-correlation
that is fully data-driven, which decomposes the data into a set of individual
spectra and their corresponding spatial distributions. This strategy is called
spectral unmixing. We used an orthogonal subspace projection to identify the
most distinct spectra in the field of view. Their spatial distribution maps
were then obtained by inverting the data. These spectra were then used to break
the original hyperspectral images into their corresponding spatial distribution
maps via non-negative least squares. The performance of our method was
evaluated and compared with a cross-correlation using simulated hyperspectral
data with medium resolution from the ELT/HARMONI integral field spectrograph.
We show that spectral unmixing effectively leads to a planet detection solely
based on spectral dissimilarities at significantly reduced computational cost.
The extracted spectrum holds significant signatures of the planet while being
not perfectly separated from residual starlight. The sensitivity of the
supervised cross-correlation is three to four times higher than with
unsupervised spectral unmixing, the gap is biased toward the former because the
injected and correlated spectrum match perfectly. The algorithm was furthermore
vetted on real data obtained with VLT/SINFONI of the beta Pictoris system.

expensive. In particular, when dealing with systems having high input
dimensionality, reliability estimation becomes a daunting task. A popular
approach to overcome the problem associated with time-consuming and expensive
evaluations is building a surrogate model. However, these computationally
efficient models often suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Hence, training
a surrogate model for high-dimensional problems is not straightforward.
Henceforth, this paper presents a framework for solving high-dimensional
reliability analysis problems. The basic premise is to train the surrogate
model on a low-dimensional manifold, discovered using the active subspace
algorithm. However, learning the low-dimensional manifold using active subspace
is non-trivial as it requires information on the gradient of the response
variable. To address this issue, we propose using sparse learning algorithms in
conjunction with the active subspace algorithm; the resulting algorithm is
referred to as the sparse active subspace (SAS) algorithm. We project the
high-dimensional inputs onto the identified low-dimensional manifold identified
using SAS. A high-fidelity surrogate model is used to map the inputs on the
low-dimensional manifolds to the output response. We illustrate the efficacy of
the proposed framework by using three benchmark reliability analysis problems
from the literature. The results obtained indicate the accuracy and efficiency
of the proposed approach compared to already established reliability analysis
methods in the literature.

  Financial Forecasting","International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) represent the de facto standard machine
learning tool for sequence modelling, owing to their expressive power and
memory. However, when dealing with large dimensional data, the corresponding
exponential increase in the number of parameters imposes a computational
bottleneck. The necessity to equip RNNs with the ability to deal with the curse
of dimensionality, such as through the parameter compression ability inherent
to tensors, has led to the development of the Tensor-Train RNN (TT-RNN).
Despite achieving promising results in many applications, the full potential of
the TT-RNN is yet to be explored in the context of interpretable financial
modelling, a notoriously challenging task characterized by multi-modal data
with low signal-to-noise ratio. To address this issue, we investigate the
potential of TT-RNN in the task of financial forecasting of currencies. We
show, through the analysis of TT-factors, that the physical meaning underlying
tensor decomposition, enables the TT-RNN model to aid the interpretability of
results, thus mitigating the notorious ""black-box"" issue associated with neural
networks. Furthermore, simulation results highlight the regularization power of
TT decomposition, demonstrating the superior performance of TT-RNN over its
uncompressed RNN counterpart and other tensor forecasting methods.

This leads to the problem of incomplete-information learning. We consider this

proposes a novel approach to engineering the online adaptation of SLAS. It
separates three concerns that are related to the adaptation policy and presents
the modeling and synthesis process, with the goal of achieving higher model

mechanisms to face dynamic resource requests in Internet Service Provider (ISP)

networks, but in case of excessive traffic churns also to offloading VNFs to
third party cloud providers. We propose to study how traffic forecasting can
help to reduce the number of required migrations and replications when the
traffic dynamically changes in the network. We analyze and compare three
scenarios for the VNF migrations and replications based on: (i) the current
observed traffic demands only, (ii) specific maximum traffic demand value
observed in the past, or (iii) predictive traffic values. For the prediction of
traffic demand values, we use an LSTM model which is proven to be one of the
most accurate methods in time series forecasting problems. Based the traffic
prediction model, we then use a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model
as well as a greedy algorithm to solve this optimization problem that considers
migrations and replications of VNFs. The results show that LSTM-based traffic
prediction can reduce the number of migrations up to 45\% when there is enough
available resources to allocate replicas, while less cloud-based offloading is
required compared to overprovisioning.

the mean of the weight distribution. We conclude that even for simple networks
with non-plastic neurons and synapses, a discretization of synaptic weights can
lead to substantial deviations in the firing statistics, unless the
discretization is performed with care and guided by a rigorous validation
process.

we propose CondLaneNet, a novel top-to-down lane detection framework that
detects the lane instances first and then dynamically predicts the line shape

problem, we introduce a conditional lane detection strategy based on
conditional convolution and row-wise formulation. Further, we design the
Recurrent Instance Module(RIM) to overcome the problem of detecting lane lines
with complex topologies such as dense lines and fork lines. Benefit from the
end-to-end pipeline which requires little post-process, our method has
real-time efficiency. We extensively evaluate our method on three benchmarks of
lane detection. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on all three benchmark datasets. Moreover, our method has the
coexistence of accuracy and efficiency, e.g. a 78.14 F1 score and 220 FPS on

Named Data Networking (NDN). To realize the efficient name lookup, what counts
is deploying a highperformance index in content routers. So far, the proposed
indexes have shown good performance, most of which are optimized for or
evaluated with URLs collected from the current Internet, as the large-scale NDN
names are not available yet. Unfortunately, the performance of these indexes is
always impacted in terms of lookup speed, memory consumption and false positive
probability, as the distributions of URLs retrieved in memory may differ from
those of real NDN names independently generated by content-centric applications
online. Focusing on this gap, a smart mapping model named Pyramid-NN via neural
networks is proposed to build an index called LNI for NDN forwarding plane.
Through learning the distributions of the names retrieved in the static memory,
LNI can not only reduce the memory consumption and the probability of false
positive, but also ensure the performance of real NDN name lookup. Experimental
results show that LNI-based FIB can reduce the memory consumption to 58.258 MB
for 2 million names. Moreover, as it can be deployed on SRAMs, the throughput
is about 177 MSPS, which well meets the current network requirement for fast
packet processing.

Current state-of-the-art works suggest that performing category alignment can
alleviate domain shift reasonably. However, they are mainly based on
image-to-image adversarial training and little consideration is given to
semantic variations of an object among images, failing to capture a
comprehensive picture of different categories. This motivates us to explore a
holistic representative, the semantic distribution from each category in source
domain, to mitigate the problem above. In this paper, we present semantic
distribution-aware contrastive adaptation algorithm that enables pixel-wise
representation alignment under the guidance of semantic distributions.
Specifically, we first design a pixel-wise contrastive loss by considering the
correspondences between semantic distributions and pixel-wise representations
from both domains. Essentially, clusters of pixel representations from the same
category should cluster together and those from different categories should
spread out. Next, an upper bound on this formulation is derived by involving
the learning of an infinite number of (dis)similar pairs, making it efficient.
Finally, we verify that SDCA can further improve segmentation accuracy when
integrated with the self-supervised learning. We evaluate SDCA on multiple
benchmarks, achieving considerable improvements over existing algorithms.The

Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observations in recent years have revealed
that in general long GRBs originate from massive star core collapse events,
whereas short GRBs originate from binary neutron star mergers. It has been
known that the duration criterion is sometimes unreliable, and multi-wavelength
criteria are needed to identify the physical origin of a particular GRB. Some
apparently long GRBs have been suggested to have a neutron star merger origin,
whereas some apparently short GRBs have been attributed to genuinely long GRBs
whose short, bright emission is slightly above the detector's sensitivity
threshold. Here we report the comprehensive analysis of the multi-wavelength

shows a duration of 1 second and no evidence of an underlying longer-duration
event. Its other observational properties such as its spectral behaviors, total
energy, and host galaxy offset, are, however, inconsistent with those of other
short GRBs believed to originate from binary neutron star mergers. Rather,
these properties resemble those of long GRBs. This burst confirms the existence
of short duration GRBs with stellar core-collapse origin, and presents some

applications ranging from solar energy harvesting and photoacoustic imaging to

Here, building on a phase-field model, we report on the existence of strong
pressure waves that are emitted when vapor nanobubbles first form around a
laser-heated nanoparticle immersed in water, and subsequently after bubble
rebound. These effects are strongest when the fluid is locally brought high in
its supercritical state, which may be realized with a short laser pulse.
Because of the highly out-of-equilibrium nature of nanobubble generation, the
waves combine a high pressure peak with a fast pressure rising time, and
propagate in water over micron distances, opening the way to induce spatially
and temporally localized damage. Discussing the consequences on biological cell
membranes, we conclude that acoustic-mediated perforation is more efficient
than nanobubble expansion to breach membrane. Our findings should serve as
guide for optimizing the thermoacoustic conversion efficiency of plasmonic

Extends arXiv:2005.01133",,,,"math.QA math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum invariants like the colored Jones polynomial are algebraic in nature
but are conjectured to detect important information about the geometry of
links. In this thesis we explore these connections using an enhanced version of
the RT construction. Our invariants take the holonomy of a flat connection on
the link complement as input, so we call them holonomy invariants. The case of
trivial holonomy recovers the ordinary RT construction.
  We consider holonomy representations into $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$,
which are closely related to hyperbolic geometry. In order to define our
invariants we consider a particular coordinate system on the space of
representations closely related to the octahedral decomposition of the knot
complement. We call the corresponding diagrams shaped tangles.
  Using shaped tangles we define a family of holonomy invariants $\mathrm{J}_N$
indexed by integers $N \ge 2$, which we call the nonabelian quantum
dilogarithm. They can be interpreted as a noncommutative deformation of
Kashaev's quantum dilogarithm (equivalently, the $N$th colored Jones polynomial
at a $N$th root of unity) or of the ADO invariants, depending on the
eigenvalues of the holonomy. Our construction depends in an essential way on
representations of quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at $q = \xi$ a primitive $2N$th
root of unity. We show that $\mathrm{J}_N$ is defined up to a power of $\xi$
and does not depend on the gauge class of the holonomy.
  Afterwards we introduce a version of the quantum double construction for the
holonomy invariants. We show that the quantum double $\mathrm{T}_N$ of the
nonabelian dilogarithm $\mathrm{J}_N$ admits a canonical normalization with no
phase ambiguity. Finally, we prove that in the case $N = 2$ the doubled
invariant $\mathrm{T}_2$ computes the Reidemeister torsion of the link
complement twisted by the holonomy representation.

dimensional latent space and then a decoder to map the latent space
representations back to the data space. Implicitly, it relies on the encoder to
approximate the inverse of the decoder network, so that samples can be mapped
to and back from the latent space faithfully. This approximation may lead to
sub-optimal latent space representations. In this work, we investigate a
decoder-only method that uses gradient flow to encode data samples in the
latent space. The gradient flow is defined based on a given decoder and aims to
find the optimal latent space representation for any given sample through
optimisation, eliminating the need of an approximate inversion through an
encoder. Implementing gradient flow through ordinary differential equations
(ODE), we leverage the adjoint method to train a given decoder. We further show
empirically that the costly integrals in the adjoint method may not be entirely
necessary. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant to the method,
which approximates Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent, with faster
convergence per iteration. Commonly used ODE solvers can be quite sensitive to
the integration step-size depending on the stiffness of the ODE. To overcome
the sensitivity for gradient flow encoding, we use an adaptive solver that
prioritises minimising loss at each integration step. We assess the proposed
method in comparison to the autoencoding model. In our experiments, GFE showed
a much higher data-efficiency than the autoencoding model, which can be crucial
for data scarce applications.

basic idea behind our method is to reduce the data into a two-dimensional space

degree of anomaly in both spatial and density domains. Specifically, we
transform the data points into a density space and measure the distances in
density domain between each point and its k-Nearest Neighbors in spatial
domain. Then, an anomaly coordinate system is built by collecting two
unilateral anomalies from k-nearest neighbors of each point. Further more, we
introduce two schemes to model their correlation and combine them to get the
final anomaly score. Experiments performed on the synthetic and real world
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs well and achieve highest
average performance. We also show that the proposed method can provide
visualization and classification of the anomalies in a simple manner. Due to
the complexity of the anomaly, none of the existing methods can perform best on
all benchmark datasets. Our method takes into account both the spatial domain
and the density domain and can be adapted to different datasets by adjusting a
few parameters manually.

guidance on network design. In this paper, we analyze the performance of
DL-based MIMO detection to better understand its strengths and weaknesses. We
investigate two different architectures: a data-driven DL detector with a
neural network activated by rectifier linear unit (ReLU) function and a
model-driven DL detector from unfolding a traditional iterative detection
algorithm. We demonstrate that data-driven DL detector asymptotically
approaches to the maximum a posterior (MAP) detector in various scenarios but
requires enough training samples to converge in time-varying channels. On the
other hand, the model-driven DL detector utilizes model expert knowledge to
alleviate the impact of channels and establish a relatively reliable detection
method with a small set of training data. Due to its model specific property,
the performance of model-driven DL detector is largely determined by the
underlying iterative detection algorithm, which is usually suboptimal compared
to the MAP detector. Simulation results confirm our analytical results and
demonstrate the effectiveness of DL-based MIMO detection for both linear and

hydrogen peroxide has been recognized as the major anti-cancer agent of PTL and
may enable selectivity in a certain concentration regime, the co-existence of
nitrite can create a synergistic effect. We develop a mathematical model to
describe the key species and features of the cellular response towards PTL.
From the numerical solutions, we define a number of dependent variables, which
represent feasible measures to quantify cell susceptibility in terms of the
hydrogen peroxide membrane diffusion rate constant and the intracellular
catalase concentration. For each of these dependent variables, we investigate
the regimes of selective versus non-selective, and of synergistic versus
non-synergistic effect to evaluate their potential role as a measure of cell
susceptibility. Our results suggest that the maximal intracellular hydrogen
peroxide concentration, which in the selective regime is almost four times
greater for the most susceptible cells compared to the most resistant cells,
could be used to quantify the cell susceptibility towards exogenous hydrogen
peroxide. We believe our theoretical approach brings novelty to the field of

susceptibility of thermal states for the Ising model in a transverse field. We
compare the exact results with a common approximation that considers only the
positive-parity subspace, which is shown to be valid only at high temperatures.
The proper inclusion of the odd parity subspace leads to the enhancement of
maximal fidelity susceptibility in the intermediate range of temperatures. We
show that this enhancement persists in the thermodynamic limit and scales
quadratically with the system size. The correct low-temperature behavior is
captured by an approximation involving the two lowest many-body energy
eigenstates, from which simple expressions are obtained for the thermal
susceptibility and specific heat.

epoch optical spectra sampled more than 15 yr in the observed frame. We
identified 3/3 quasars undergoing pristine/tentative BAL transformations. The
incidence of pristine BAL transformations in the sample is therefore derived to
be 2.2$_{-1.2}^{+2.2}$\%, consistent with that of high-ionization BAL
transformations from the literature. Adopting an average \mgii-BAL
disappearance timescale of rest-frame 6.89 yr among the six quasars, the
average characteristic lifetime of \mgii\ BALs in the sample is constrained to
be $>$160 yr along our line of sight. There is a diversity of BAL-profile
variability observed in the six quasars, probably reflecting a variety of
mechanisms at work. Our investigations of \mgii-BAL transitions, combined with
observational studies of BAL transitions from the literature, imply an overall
FeLoBAL/LoBAL$\rightarrow$HiBAL/non-BAL transformation sequence along with a
decrease in reddening. This sequence is consistent with the evacuation models
for the origin of commonly seen blue quasars, in which LoBAL quasars are in a
shorted-lived, blowout phase.

  ArXiv requirements",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Subgraph Isomorphism problem is of considerable importance in computer
science. We examine the problem when the pattern graph H is of bounded
treewidth, as occurs in a variety of applications. This problem has a
well-known algorithm via color-coding that runs in time $O(n^{tw(H)+1})$ [Alon,
Yuster, Zwick'95], where $n$ is the number of vertices of the host graph $G$.
While there are pattern graphs known for which Subgraph Isomorphism can be
solved in an improved running time of $O(n^{tw(H)+1-\varepsilon})$ or even
faster (e.g. for $k$-cliques), it is not known whether such improvements are
possible for all patterns. The only known lower bound rules out time
$n^{o(tw(H) / \log(tw(H)))}$ for any class of patterns of unbounded treewidth
assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis [Marx'07].
  In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of maximally hard pattern graphs
$H$ that require time $n^{tw(H)+1-o(1)}$. Specifically, under the Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), a standard assumption from fine-grained
complexity theory, we prove the following asymptotic statement for large
treewidth $t$: For any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $t \ge 3$ and a pattern
graph $H$ of treewidth $t$ such that Subgraph Isomorphism on pattern $H$ has no
algorithm running in time $O(n^{t+1-\varepsilon})$.
  Under the more recent 3-uniform Hyperclique hypothesis, we even obtain tight
lower bounds for each specific treewidth $t \ge 3$: For any $t \ge 3$ there
exists a pattern graph $H$ of treewidth $t$ such that for any $\varepsilon>0$
Subgraph Isomorphism on pattern $H$ has no algorithm running in time
$O(n^{t+1-\varepsilon})$.
  In addition to these main results, we explore (1) colored and uncolored
problem variants (and why they are equivalent for most cases), (2) Subgraph
Isomorphism for $tw < 3$, (3) Subgraph Isomorphism parameterized by pathwidth,
and (4) a weighted problem variant.

(LGRBs; T90 >2 s) have been attributed to the collapse of peculiar massive
stars (collapsars). The discovery of SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 marked the first
association of a LGRB with a collapsar and AT 2017gfo/GRB 170817A/GW170817

Follow-up imaging (at rest-frame 16.5 days) reveals excess emission above the
afterglow that cannot be explained as an underlying kilonova (KN), but is
consistent with being the supernova (SN). Despite the GRB duration being short

collapsar origin. GRB 200826A is the shortest LGRB found with an associated
collapsar; it appears to sit on the brink between a successful and a failed
collapsar. Our discovery is consistent with the hypothesis that most collapsars

adopted by earthquake early warning systems (EEWSs) that rely on location and
magnitude information. In the previous study, we used 10 s, raw, multistation

dataset). The CI dataset has a large number of spatially concentrated
earthquakes and a dense station network. In this work, we applied the CNN model
to an area around the VIRGO gravitational waves observatory sited near Pisa,
Italy. In our initial application of the technique, we used a dataset
consisting of 266 earthquakes recorded by 39 stations. We found that the CNN
model trained using this smaller dataset performed worse compared to the
results presented in the original study by Jozinovi\'c et al. (2020). To
counter the lack of data, we adopted transfer learning (TL) using two
approaches: first, by using a pre-trained model built on the CI dataset and,
next, by using a pre-trained model built on a different (seismological) problem
that has a larger dataset available for training. We show that the use of TL
improves the results in terms of outliers, bias, and variability of the
residuals between predicted and true IMs values. We also demonstrate that
adding knowledge of station positions as an additional layer in the neural

confirmation that these two features arise from different grain populations.
The strength of the 10 micron silicate feature varies by $\sim$2.5 and is not

limitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly
under even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b)
they generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with
minimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in
the decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC
rates under diverse real-world conditions. Deep-Light's key innovation is the
design of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes
all the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to
precisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition,
DeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the
intensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen
extraction (IoU values >= 83%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN
pipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly

that the resistive switching is associated with the creation of a conducting

\pm 0.06$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.33 \pm 0.07$ and at most $1\sigma$ differences
in all other parameter values. Our best-fit galaxy luminosity functions yield a

lie below the mass thresholds where stellar mass assembly is predicted to be

quantum mechanics, the $5D$ Bianchi I model admits a solution in which three
space directions expand isotropically, while the remaining one is static,
offering in this way a very valuable scenario to implement a Kaluza-Klein
paradigm, identifying in such a static dimension the compactified one. We then
analyse the behaviour of geodesic motion in the context of the polymer
representation, as referred to a $5D$ space-time with a static dimension. We
demonstrate that such a revised formulation allows overcoming one of the
puzzling questions of the standard Kaluza-Klein model corresponding to the
limit of the charge to mass ratio for a particle, inapplicable to any
fundamental one. Indeed, here, such a ratio can be naturally attributed to
particles predicted by the Standard Model and no internal contradiction of the
theory arises on this level. Finally, we study the morphology of the field
equation associated with a charged scalar particle, i.e. we analyse a
Klein-Gordon equation, which fifth coordinate is viewed in the polymer
representation. Here we obtain the surprising result that, although the
Kaluza-Klein tower has a deformed structure characterized by irregular steps,
the value predicted for the particle mass can be, in principle, set within the
Standard Model mass distribution and hence, the problem of the Planckian value
of such mass, typical of the standard formulation, is now overcome. However, a

Specifically, for the Markov chain $\mathbf{U} \leftrightarrow \mathbf{X}

of the paper, the main identity is specialized to the exponential family.
Moreover, via various choices of the random vector $\mathbf{U}$, the new

have shown that core transport is no longer mostly neoclassical, as is the case
in previous kinds of stellarators. Instead, turbulent transport poses a serious
limitation to the global performance of the machine. Several studies have found
this particularly relevant for ion transport, with core ion temperatures
becoming clamped at relatively low values of $T_{i} \simeq 1.7$ keV, except in
the few scenarios in which turbulence can be suppressed. In order to understand
turbulent mechanisms at play, it is important to have a clear understanding of
the parametric dependencies of turbulent fluctuations, and the relation between
them and turbulent transport. In this work we use Doppler reflectometry
measurements carried out during a number of relevant operational scenarios to
provide a systematic characterization of ion-scale ($k_\perp\rho_i\simeq 1$)
density fluctuations in the core of W7-X. Then, we study the relation between
fluctuation amplitude and plasma profiles and show how distinct regimes can be
defined for the former, depending on normalized gradients $a/L_{ne}$ and
$a/L_{Ti}$. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of other potentially
relevant parameters such as $T_e/T_i$, $E_r$ or collisionality. Comparing the
different regimes, we find that turbulence amplitude depends generally on the
gradient ratio $\eta_i=L_{ne}/L_{Ti}$, as would be expected for ITG modes, with
the exception of a range of discharges, for which turbulence suppression may be
better explained by an ITG to TEM transition triggered by a drop in
collisionality. Finally, we show a number of scenarios under which $T_{i,core}
> 1.7$ keV is achieved and how core fluctuations are suppressed in all of them,
thus providing experimental evidence of microturbulence being the main
responsible for the limited ion confinement in W7-X.

a rapid rotator seen nearly pole-on with low i (< 10 deg), no consensus has yet
been accomplished regarding its intrinsic rotational velocity (v_e), for which
rather different values have been reported so far. Methodologically, detailed
analysis of spectral line profiles is useful for this purpose, since they
reflect more or less the v_e-dependent gravitational darkening effect. However,
direct comparison of observed and theoretically simulated line profiles is not
necessarily effective in practice, where the solution is sensitively affected
by various conditions and the scope for combining many lines is lacking. In
this study, determination of Vega's v_e was attempted based on an alternative
approach making use of the first zero (q_1) of the Fourier transform of each
line profile, which depends upon K (temperature sensitivity parameter differing
from line to line) and v_e. It turned out that v_e and vsini could be
separately established by comparing the observed q_1^obs and calculated q_1^cal
values for a number of lines of different K. Actually, independent analysis
applied to two line sets (49 Fe I lines and 41 Fe II lines) yielded results
reasonably consistent with each other. The final parameters of Vega's rotation
were concluded as vsini = 21.6 (+/- 0.3) km/s, v_e = 195 (+/- 15) km/s, and i =
6.4 (+/- 0.5) deg.

the previous results to the case of additive bias $Y=f(WX+B)$ with $B$ being an

case of additive bias it is impossible to choose an activation function

the bias-free case where a simple integral constraint is sufficient to achieve
isospectrality. To obtain the asymptotics for the empirical spectral density we
follow the resolvent method from random matrix theory via the cumulant

exotic phenomena. Recently, vanadium-based materials with layered kagome

cyclotron harmonic (ECH) and upper-band chorus (UBC) waves. It is known that
these waves scatter 100s of eV to 10s of keV electrons from the plasma sheet,

this paper, we report on an interesting and unusual auroral feature observed on
March 15, 2002. We believe that these observations could help further our
understanding of waves associated with diffuse aurora. This diffuse auroral
feature is characterized by four phases: (1) the initial phase exhibiting
regular diffuse aurora, (2) the brightening phase, where an east-west auroral
stripe rapidly brightens, (3) the eraser phase, where the stripe dims to below
its initial state, and (4) the recovery phase, where the diffuse aurora returns
to its original brightness. Using a superposed epoch analysis of 22 events, we
calculate the average recovery phase time to be 20 seconds, although this
varies widely between events. We hypothesize that the process responsible for
these auroral eraser events could be the result of chorus waves modulating
diffuse aurora.

Second, we leverage such a model to devise computationally-efficient algorithms
to determine the energy-optimal design and control strategies for the
transmission. In particular, with the objective of minimizing the EM energy
consumption on a given drive cycle, we analytically compute the optimal
gear-ratio trajectory for a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and the
optimal gear-ratio design for a fixed-gear transmission (FGT) in closed form,
whilst efficiently solving the combinatorial joint gear-ratio design and
control problem for a multiple-gear transmission (MGT), combining convex
analysis and dynamic programming in an iterative fashion. Third, we validate
our models with nonlinear simulations, and benchmark the optimality of our
methods with mixed-integer quadratic programming. Finally, we showcase our
framework in a case-study for a family vehicle, whereby we leverage the
computational efficiency of our methods to jointly optimize the EM size via
exhaustive search. Our numerical results show that by using a 2-speed MGT, the
energy consumption of an electric vehicle can be reduced by 3% and 2.5%

field. Combining the measured reflectivity with the dc resistivity, the complex

dependence of the real part of the optical conductivity exhibits a MIR peak
around 4000 cm$^{-1}$ and a narrow Drude peak that develops below 40 K. A
combination of density functional and dynamic mean field theory (DFT + DMFT)
gives spectra in close correspondence to the experiment. Via this comparison we
attribute the prominent MIR peak to inter-band transitions involving a narrow U
5$f$ feature that develops near the Fermi level. In this regard, our data gives
spectroscopic evidence for the existence of a low energy Kondo resonance at
temperatures just above the onset of superconductivity and implicates heavy
electrons in the formation of the superconducting state. We find that the
coherent Kondo resonance is primarily associated with a collapse of scattering
and less with a transfer of spectral weight.

In this model, the seller may specify a quantile interval and sample from a
buyer's prior restricted to the interval. This can be interpreted as allowing
the seller to, for example, examine the top $40$ percents bids from previous
buyers with the same characteristics. The targeting power is quantified with a
parameter $\Delta \in [0, 1]$ which lower bounds how small the quantile
intervals could be. When $\Delta = 1$, it degenerates to Cole and Roughgarden's
model of i.i.d. samples; when it is the idealized case of $\Delta = 0$, it
degenerates to the model studied by Chen et al. (2018). For instance, for $n$
buyers with bounded values in $[0, 1]$, $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ targeted
samples suffice while it is known that at least $\tilde{\Omega}(n
\epsilon^{-2})$ i.i.d. samples are needed. In other words, targeted sampling
with sufficient targeting power allows us to remove the linear dependence in
$n$, and to improve the quadratic dependence in $\epsilon^{-1}$ to linear. In
this work, we introduce new technical ingredients and show that the number of
targeted samples sufficient for learning an $\epsilon$-optimal auction is
substantially smaller than the sample complexity of i.i.d. samples for the full
spectrum of $\Delta \in [0, 1)$. Even with only mild targeting power, i.e.,
whenever $\Delta = o(1)$, our targeted sample complexity upper bounds are
strictly smaller than the optimal sample complexity of i.i.d. samples.

that the electronic polarizability explains correctly and quantitatively the

measurements on nightly GOTO data. By comparing the photometry measurements of
sources taken on multiple nights, we find that the precision of our photometry
is typically better than 20~mmag for sources brighter than 16 mag. We also
compare our photometry measurements against colour-corrected PanSTARRS
photometry, and find that the two agree to within 10~mmag (1$\sigma$) for
bright (i.e., $\sim14^{\rm th}$~mag) sources to 200~mmag for faint (i.e.,
$\sim18^{\rm th}$~mag) sources. Additionally, we compare our results to those
obtained by GOTO's own in-house pipeline, {\sc gotophoto}, and obtain similar
results. Based on repeatability measurements, we measure a $5\sigma$ L-band
survey depth of between 19 and 20 magnitudes, depending on observing
conditions. We assess, using repeated observations of non-varying standard SDSS
stars, the accuracy of our uncertainties, which we find are typically
overestimated by roughly a factor of two for bright sources (i.e., $<15^{\rm

fainter sources ($>17^{\rm th}$~mag). Finally, we present lightcurves for a
selection of variable sources, and compare them to those obtained with the
Zwicky Transient Factory and GAIA. Despite the Rubin Observatory LSST Science

modification designed to minimize the network-wide time average Age of

stay silent. When a node with age above the threshold has data to send, it
becomes active in the next time frame with a certain probability. The active
node first transmits a short control sequence in a mini-slot ahead of actual
data transmission, and if collision is sensed, it backs off with a certain
probability. We derive the steady state distribution of the number of active
sources and analyze its limiting behaviour. We show that MiSTA
probabilistically converges to a ""thinned"" slotted ALOHA, where the number of
active users at steady state adjusts to optimize age. With an optimal selection
of parameters, MiSTA achieves an AoI scaling with the number of sources, n, as
0.9641n, which is an improvement over the Threshold ALOHA policy proposed
earlier (for which the lowest possible scaling is 1.4169n). While achieving
this reduction in age, MiSTA also increases achievable throughput to

that the conservative hypothesis that the remnant in GW170817 ultimately

result might be inconsistent with the logical connection. This inconsistency is
known as the doctrinal paradox, which plays a central role in the field of
judgment aggregation. Despite a large body of literature on the worst-case
analysis of the doctrinal paradox, little is known about its likelihood under
natural statistical models, except for a few i.i.d. distributions [List, 2005].
  In this paper, we characterize the likelihood of the doctrinal paradox under
a much more general and realistic model called the smoothed social choice
framework [Xia, 2020b], where agents' ground truth judgments are arbitrarily
correlated while the noises are independent. Our main theorem states that under
mild conditions, the smoothed likelihood of the doctrinal paradox is either
$0$, $\exp(-\Theta(n))$, $\Theta(n^{-1/2})$ or $\Theta(1)$. This not only
answers open questions by List [2005] for i.i.d. distributions but also draws
clear lines between situations with frequent and with vanishing paradoxes.

chain of nested gauged classes of such systems, we single out its singular
subclass, which appears to consist of systems being similar to the elementary

singular one. This allows us to exhaustively describe the equivalence groupoids
of the above classes as well as of their singular and regular subclasses.
Applying various algebraic techniques, we establish principal properties of Lie
symmetries of the systems under consideration and outline ways for completely
classifying these symmetries. In particular, we compute the sharp lower and
upper bounds for the dimensions of the maximal Lie invariance algebras
possessed by systems from each of the above classes and subclasses. We also
show how equivalence transformations and Lie symmetries can be used for
reduction of order of such systems and their integration. As an illustrative
example of using the theory developed, we solve the complete group
classification problems for all these classes in the case of two dependent
variables.

non-infected cells and infected cells, with and without drug treatment. DEEMD
first extracts discriminative morphological features to generate cell
morphological profiles from the non-infected and infected cells. These
morphological profiles are then used in a statistical model to estimate the
applied treatment efficacy on infected cells based on similarities to
non-infected cells. DEEMD is capable of localizing infected cells via weak

moderncities since it causes time wasting, pollution, higher industrial costs
and huge roadmaintenance costs. Advances in ITS technologies and the advent of
autonomousvehicles are changing mobility dramatically. They enable the
implementation of acoordination mechanism, called coordinated traffic
assignment, among the sat-navdevices aiming at assigning paths to drivers to
eliminate congestion and to re-duce the total travel time in traffic networks.
Among possible congestion avoidance methods, coordinated traffic assignment is
a valuable choice since it does not involvehuge investments to expand the road
network. Traffic assignments are traditionally devoted to two main perspectives
on which the well-known Wardropian principlesare inspired: the user equilibrium
and the system optimum. User equilibrium is a user-driven traffic assignment in
which each user chooses the most convenientpath selfishly. It guarantees that
fairness among users is respected since, whenthe equilibrium is reached, all
users sharing the same origin and destination willexperience the same travel
time. The main drawback in a user equilibrium is thatthe system total travel
time is not minimized and, hence, the so-called Price ofAnarchy is paid. On the
other hand, the system optimum is an efficient system-wide traffic assignment
in which drivers are routed on the network in such a waythe total travel time
is minimized but users might experience travel times that arehigher than the
other users travelling from the same origin to the same destina-tion affecting
the compliance. Thus, drawbacks in implementing one of the two assignments can
be overcome by hybridizing the two approaches aiming at bridging users'
fairness to system-wide efficiency. The survey reviews the state-of-the-art of
these trade-off approaches

which learns latent feature representations of data through encoder / decoder
neural net structures. This is a suitable base for clustering tasks, as the
latent space often seems to effectively capture the inherent essence of data,
simplifying its manifold and reducing noise. In this article, the VAE framework
is used to investigate how probability function gradient ascent over data
points can be used to process data in order to achieve better clustering.
Improvements in classification is observed comparing with unprocessed data,
although state of the art results are not obtained. Processing data with
gradient descent however results in more distinct cluster separation, making it
simpler to investigate suitable hyper parameter settings such as the number of
clusters. We propose a simple yet effective method for investigating suitable
number of clusters for data, based on the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, and
demonstrate that cluster number determination is facilitated with gradient
processing. As an additional curiosity, we find that our baseline model used

set that is consistent with a set of examples and contains a minimum number of
hyperrectangles can be found in polynomial time. In contrast, this problem is
known to be NP-complete if the hyperrectangles may be overlapping.

motivation for this work is to investigate the various unknown quantum
mechanical features of primordial universe. To give the realistic
interpretation of the derived theoretical results we express everything
initially in terms of slowly varying conformal time dependent parameters, and
then to connect with cosmological observation we further express the results in
terms of cosmological observables, which are spectral index/tilt of scalar mode
power spectrum ($n_{\zeta}$) and tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$). Finally, this
identification helps us to provide the stringent numerical constraints on the
Pancharatnam Berry phase, which confronts well with recent cosmological
observation.

the previous studies suggest the usage of machine intelligence for automating
the approval process to mitigate this challenge. However, the effectiveness of
such automation may depend on the richness of the training dataset and model
efficiency. We have recently developed a novel classifier named random wheel
which provides a more interpretable output. In this work, we have used an
enhanced version of random wheel to facilitate a trustworthy recommendation for
credit card approval process. It not only produces more accurate and precise
recommendation but also provides an interpretable confidence measure. Besides,
it explains the machine recommendation for each credit card application as
well. The availability of recommendation confidence and explanation could bring
more trust in the machine provided intelligence which in turn can enhance the
efficiency of the credit card approval process.

imposed as terms in a loss function or used to formulate a neural ansatz. In
the present case study, we calculate the induced field inside and outside a
dielectric cube placed in a uniform electric field, wherein the dielectric
mismatch at edges and corners of the cube makes accurate calculations
numerically challenging. The electric potential is expressed as an ansatz
incorporating neural networks with known leading order behaviors and symmetries
and the Laplace's equation is then solved with boundary conditions at the
dielectric interface by minimizing a loss function. The loss function ensures
that both Laplace's equation and boundary conditions are satisfied everywhere
inside a large solution domain. We study how the electric potential inside and
outside a quasi-cubic particle evolves through a sequence of shapes from a
sphere to a cube. The neural network being differentiable, it is
straightforward to calculate the electric field over the whole domain, the
induced surface charge distribution and the polarizability. The neural network
being retentive, one can efficiently follow how the field changes upon
particle's shape or dielectric constant by iterating from any previously
converged solution. The present work's objective is two-fold, first to show how
an a priori knowledge can be incorporated into neural networks to achieve
efficient learning and second to apply the method and study how the induced

Cluster/RAPID observations, we have derived machine learning-based models to
predict the proton intensities at energies from 28 to 1,885 keV in the 3D

satellite location and indices for solar, solar wind and geomagnetic activity
as predictors. The results demonstrate that the neural network (multi-layer

The average correlation between the observed and predicted data is about 56%,
which is reasonable in light of the complex dynamics of fast-moving energetic
protons in the magnetosphere. In addition to a quantitative analysis of the
prediction results, we also investigate parameter importance in our model. The
most decisive parameters for predicting proton intensities are related to the
location: ZGSE direction and the radial distance. Among the activity indices,
the solar wind dynamic pressure is the most important. The results have a

congestion and emissions, if it attracts private car users. Therefore, it is
crucial to identify the strategic phenomena that determine when ODRP systems
can run efficiently. In this paper, we analyze the performance of an ODRP
system, in which the fleet of low-capacity vehicles is endogenously adapted to
the demand, and operated in a zone covered by a single transit line. The
routing of the on-demand fleet follows some of the rules of public transport
systems; namely, it is not-for-profit, some users can be required to walk, and
all requests must be served. Considering both users' and operators' costs we
identify two sources of scale economies: when demand grows, the average cost is
reduced due to a) an equivalent of the Mohring Effect (also present in public
transport), and b) due to matching users with more similar routes when they are
assigned to the vehicles, which we call Better-matching Effect. A
counter-balance force, called Flex-route Effect, is observed when the vehicle
loads increase and users face longer detours. We find a specific demand range
in which the latter effect dominates the others, imposing diseconomies of scale
when only users' costs are considered. Such a phenomenon emerges because the
routes are not fixed; hence, it is not observed in traditional public transport
systems. However, when considering both users' and operators' costs, scale
economies prevail. Our simulations show that relaxing door-to-door vehicle
requirements to allow short walks is crucial for the performance of ODRP. In
fact, we observe that an ODRP system with human-driven vehicles and walks
allowed has a total cost at a similar level to that of a door-to-door ODRP
system with driverless vehicles.
