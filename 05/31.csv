constructing confidence sets using the convex hull of estimates constructed
from subsets of the data. Unlike classical methods which are based on
estimating the (limiting) distribution of an estimator, the HulC is often
simpler to use and effectively bypasses this step. In comparison to the
bootstrap, the HulC requires fewer regularity conditions and succeeds in many
examples where the bootstrap provably fails. Unlike subsampling, the HulC does
not require knowledge of the rate of convergence of the estimators on which it
is based. The validity of the HulC requires knowledge of the (asymptotic)
median-bias of the estimators. We further analyze a variant of our basic
method, called the Adaptive HulC, which is fully data-driven and estimates the
median-bias using subsampling. We show that the Adaptive HulC retains the
aforementioned strengths of the HulC. In certain cases where the underlying
estimators are pathologically asymmetric the HulC and Adaptive HulC can fail to
provide useful confidence sets. We propose a final variant, the Unimodal HulC,
which can salvage the situation in cases where the distribution of the
underlying estimator is (asymptotically) unimodal. We discuss these methods in
the context of several challenging inferential problems which arise in
parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric inference. Although our focus
is on validity under weak regularity conditions, we also provide some general
results on the width of the HulC confidence sets, showing that in many cases
the HulC confidence sets have near-optimal width.

conditions, probably associated with climate change, cast shades of doubt on
whether the resulting generation portfolios are sufficiently robust to assure,
at all times, a suitable balance between generation and demand, when adverse
conditions are faced. To address this issue, this work elaborates a methodology
intended to determine a sustainable electricity system that can endure extreme
weather conditions, which are likely to occur. First, using hourly production
and demand data from the last decade, along with estimates of new uses of
electricity, a worst-case scenario is constructed, including the storage
capacity and additional photovoltaic power which are needed to serve the demand
on an hourly basis. Next, several key parameters which may have a significant
influence on the LCOE are considered, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out
to determine their real impact, significance and potential trends. The proposed
methodology is then applied to the Spanish system. The results show that, under
the hypotheses and conditions considered in this paper, it is possible to
design a decarbonized electricity system that, taking advantage of existing
sustainable assets, satisfies the long-term needs by providing a reliable
supply at an average cost significantly lower than current market prices.

  Analogous obstruction is suggested here for discrete group graded algebras

to every equivariance class of absolutely simple graded modules.
  The set of equivariance classes of such modules is equipped with an

map is a homomorphism of abelian monoids. Graded products, essentially arising
as pull-backs of bundles, admit many nice properties, including a way to twist
graded algebras and their graded modules.

Furthermore, we measure the temperature(T) dependence of the resistivity

range 10K to 50K for the density regime $n_{s1} <n<n_{s2}$ with a large slope
d$\rho$/dT $\sim$ 8.5~$\Omega$/K. The large slope of d$\rho$/dT is attributed
to the enhanced electron-phonon coupling arising due to the suppression of

of maxima or minima nomination sampling (NS) designs. These sampling designs
are useful for obtaining more representative sample units from the tails of the
population distribution using the available auxiliary ranking information.
However, one common difficulty in performing NS in practice is that the
researcher cannot obtain a nominated sample unless he/she uniquely determines
the sample unit with the highest or the lowest rank in each set. To overcome
this problem, a variant of NS which is called partial nomination sampling is
proposed in which the researcher is allowed to declare that two or more units
are tied in the ranks whenever he/she cannot find with high confidence the
sample unit with the highest or the lowest rank with high confidence. Based on
this sampling design, two asymptotically unbiased estimators are developed for
the cumulative distribution function, which are obtained using maximum
likelihood and moment-based approaches, and their asymptotic normality is
proved. Several numerical studies have shown that the developed estimators have
higher relative efficiencies than their counterpart in simple random sampling
in analyzing either the upper or the lower tail of the parent distribution. The
procedures that we are developed are then implemented on a real dataset from
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to
estimate the prevalence of osteoporosis among adult women aged 50 and over. It
is shown that in some certain circumstances, the techniques that we have
developed require only one-third of the sample size needed in SRS to achieve
the desired precision. This results in a considerable reduction of time and
cost compared to the standard SRS method.

outcome interceded by a mediator. Two simple hypotheses are tested: the effect
of the exposure on the mediator, and the effect of the mediator on the outcome.
When either of these hypotheses is true, a predetermined significance level can
be assured. When both nulls are true, the same test becomes conservative.
Adaptively finding the correct scenario enables customizing the tests and
consequently enlarges their efficiency, which is most important in a multiple
testing framework. In this work, we link between adaptive two-stage procedures
and shrinkage estimators. We first study the properties of shrinkage
estimators, and characterize their behavior at different parameter points using
local asymptotics. We formulate theoretical results regarding shrinkage
estimators, compared to regular estimators. We then discuss the
multiple-testing framework and state results about using shrinkage estimator in
two-stage procedures for controlling the FWER. Taking advantage of these
theoretical results, we suggest a number of estimators and test statistics for
the two-stage mediation procedures. We then investigate their empirical FWER
and power, compared to regular estimators and tests, through simulations.

customer with high perceived value buys, returns, and recommends items. The
perceived value is at risk whenever the information load harms users' shopping

majority of which is irrelevant for the shopper. Recommender systems (RS)
enable businesses to master information overload (IO) by providing users with
an item ranking by relevance. Prior work proposes RS with short personalized
rankings (top-k). Given large order sizes and high user heterogeneity in
e-grocery, top-k RS are insufficient to diminish IO in this domain. To fill
this gap and raise business performance, this paper introduces an RS with a
personalized long ranking (top-N). Undertaking a randomized field experiment,
the paper establishes the merit of shifting from top-k to top-N rankings.
Specifically, the proposed RS reduces IO by 29.4% and lowers users' search time
by 3.3 seconds per item. The field experiment also reveals a 7% uplift in
revenue due to the top-N ranking. Substantial benefits for the customer and the

to explaining their high generalization performance. To examine the structure
of when and where memorization occurs in a deep network, we use a recently
developed replica-based mean field theoretic geometric analysis method. We find
that all layers preferentially learn from examples which share features, and
link this behavior to generalization performance. Memorization predominately
occurs in the deeper layers, due to decreasing object manifolds' radius and
dimension, whereas early layers are minimally affected. This predicts that
generalization can be restored by reverting the final few layer weights to
earlier epochs before significant memorization occurred, which is confirmed by
the experiments. Additionally, by studying generalization under different model
sizes, we reveal the connection between the double descent phenomenon and the
underlying model geometry. Finally, analytical analysis shows that networks
avoid memorization early in training because close to initialization, the
gradient contribution from permuted examples are small. These findings provide
quantitative evidence for the structure of memorization across layers of a deep
neural network, the drivers for such structure, and its connection to manifold
geometric properties.

bias-dependent diffusion regimes of underdamped Brownian particles is
presented. A temperature threshold for a transition between anomalous and
normal diffusive behaviors is located, yielding a new phase diagram for the
system. In the low-temperature regime, the system exhibits an apparent negative
differential mobility due to persistent, long-time subdiffusion at low-bias; at
high temperature (or critical bias,) the system rapidly approaches normal
diffusion below an intermediate barrier height, $U_o \sim k_B T$. By
consideration of numerical results, comparison to the overdamped case, and the
related Kramers multistable escape problems, it is demonstrated that the
low-bias non-monotonic temperature dependence of the diffusivity, persistent
subdiffusion, and negative differential mobility can be traced to inertial
effects, which are evident in the oscillatory modes of the velocity power
spectra at low bias. In the giant diffusion regime, the velocity power spectra
exhibit coupling between the ``locked"" and ``running"" states, with a
characteristic frequency corresponding to the principal frequency of the limit
cycles of a damped, driven plane pendulum near critical bias. Non-linear second
harmonic generation, corresponding to oscillatory transient anomalous
diffusivity, is observed with increasing bias and decreasing temperature,
further emphasizing that the low-noise diffusion problem converges to
noise-free dynamics, complementing analytic results for the average velocity

so securely. The specific transmission mechanisms end up relying on the
knowledge and preferences of the parties involved. Through two online surveys

documents, as well as the perceived risk and satisfaction with those methods.
We find that users are more likely to recognize risk to data-at-rest after
receipt (but not at the sender, namely, themselves). When not using an online
portal provided by the recipient, participants primarily envision transmitting
sensitive documents in person or via email, and have little experience using

  Recovery",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Tensor completion aims to recover the missing entries of a partially observed
tensor by exploiting its low-rank structure, and has been applied to visual
data recovery. In applications where the data arrives sequentially such as
streaming video completion, the missing entries of the tensor need to be
dynamically recovered in a streaming fashion. Traditional streaming tensor
completion algorithms treat the entire visual data as a tensor, which may not
work satisfactorily when there is a big change in the tensor subspace along the
temporal dimension, such as due to strong motion across the video frames. In
this paper, we develop a novel patch tracking-based streaming tensor ring
completion framework for visual data recovery. Given a newly incoming frame,
small patches are tracked from the previous frame. Meanwhile, for each tracked
patch, a patch tensor is constructed by stacking similar patches from the new
frame. Patch tensors are then completed using a streaming tensor ring
completion algorithm, and the incoming frame is recovered using the completed
patch tensors. We propose a new patch tracking strategy that can accurately and
efficiently track the patches with missing data. Further, a new streaming
tensor ring completion algorithm is proposed which can efficiently and
accurately update the latent core tensors and complete the missing entries of
the patch tensors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed algorithms compared with both batch and streaming
state-of-the-art tensor completion methods.

The overall approach is validated by simulating walking motions of the iCub

workings of a neural network and learns a density estimator of the activation

discriminate between regular and anomalous inputs. To deal with the
high-dimensional activation-space of typical segmentation networks, we
subsample them to obtain a homogeneous spatial and layer-wise coverage. The
subsampling pattern is chosen once per monitored model and kept fixed for all
inputs. Since the attacker has access to neither the detection model nor the
sampling key, it becomes harder for them to attack the segmentation network, as
the attack cannot be backpropagated through the detector. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach using an ESPNet trained on the Cityscapes dataset
as segmentation model, an affine Normalizing Flow as density estimator and use
blue noise to ensure homogeneous sampling. Our model can be trained on a single

  MISO Wiretap Channel","6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted radio is considered as an
enabling technology with great potential for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless
communications standard. The achievable secrecy rate (ASR) is one of the most
fundamental metrics to evaluate the capability of facilitating secure
communication for RIS-assisted systems. However, the definition of ASR is based
on Shannon's information theory, which generally requires long codewords and
thus fails to quantify the secrecy of emerging delay-critical services.
Motivated by this, in this paper we investigate the problem of maximizing the
secrecy rate under a delay-limited quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, termed
as the effective secrecy rate (ESR), for an RIS-assisted multiple-input
single-output (MISO) wiretap channel subject to a transmit power constraint. We
propose an iterative method to find a stationary solution to the formulated
non-convex optimization problem using a block coordinate ascent method (BCAM),
where both the beamforming vector at the transmitter as well as the phase
shifts at the RIS are obtained in closed forms in each iteration. We also
present a convergence proof, an efficient implementation, and the associated
complexity analysis for the proposed method. Our numerical results demonstrate
that the proposed optimization algorithm converges significantly faster that an
existing solution. The simulation results also confirm that the secrecy rate
performance of the system with stringent delay requirements reduce
significantly compared to the system without any delay constraints, and that
this reduction can be significantly mitigated by an appropriately placed
large-size RIS.

the robustness of Neural Networks. Past work in this field has relied on
traditional optimization algorithms that ignore the inherent structure of the
problem and data, or generative methods that rely purely on learning and often
fail to generate adversarial examples where they are hard to find. To alleviate
these deficiencies, we propose a novel attack based on a graph neural network
(GNN) that takes advantage of the strengths of both approaches; we call it
AdvGNN. Our GNN architecture closely resembles the network we wish to attack.
During inference, we perform forward-backward passes through the GNN layers to
guide an iterative procedure towards adversarial examples. During training, its
parameters are estimated via a loss function that encourages the efficient
computation of adversarial examples over a time horizon. We show that our
method beats state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, including PGD-attack,
MI-FGSM, and Carlini and Wagner attack, reducing the time required to generate
adversarial examples with small perturbation norms by over 65\%. Moreover,
AdvGNN achieves good generalization performance on unseen networks. Finally, we
provide a new challenging dataset specifically designed to allow for a more
illustrative comparison of adversarial attacks.

such as nuclear power plants, will require leveraging advancements in machine
learning. For fission systems, accurate prediction of nuclear transport is
important to quantify the safety margin and optimize performance. The
state-of-the-art approach to this problem is costly Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations to approximate solutions of the neutron transport equation. Such an
approach is feasible for offline calculations e.g., for design or licensing,
but is precluded from use as a model-based controller. In this work, we explore
the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gradient Boosting Regression
(GBR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to
generate empirical models. The empirical model can then be deployed, e.g., in a
model predictive controller. Two fission systems are explored: the subcritical
MIT Graphite Exponential Pile (MGEP), and the critical MIT Research Reactor
(MITR).
  Findings from this work establish guidelines for developing empirical models
for multidimensional regression of neutron transport. An assessment of the
accuracy and precision finds that the SVR, followed closely by ANN, performs
the best. For both MGEP and MITR, the optimized SVR model exhibited a
domain-averaged, test, mean absolute percentage error of 0.17 %. A spatial
distribution of performance metrics indicates that physical regions of poor
performance coincide with locations of largest neutron flux perturbation --
this outcome is mitigated by ANN and SVR. Even at local maxima, ANN and SVR
bias is within experimental uncertainty bounds. A comparison of the performance
vs. training dataset size found that SVR is more data-efficient than ANN. Both
ANN and SVR achieve a greater than 7 order reduction in evaluation time vs. a
MC simulation.

and analysis. Data reduction, or subsampling, that extracts useful information
from datasets is a crucial step in big data analysis. We propose an orthogonal
subsampling (OSS) approach for big data with a focus on linear regression
models. The approach is inspired by the fact that an orthogonal array of two
levels provides the best experimental design for linear regression models in
the sense that it minimizes the average variance of the estimated parameters
and provides the best predictions. The merits of OSS are three-fold: (i) it is
easy to implement and fast; (ii) it is suitable for distributed parallel
computing and ensures the subsamples selected in different batches have no
common data points; and (iii) it outperforms existing methods in minimizing the
mean squared errors of the estimated parameters and maximizing the efficiencies
of the selected subsamples. Theoretical results and extensive numerical results
show that the OSS approach is superior to existing subsampling approaches. It
is also more robust to the presence of interactions among covariates and, when
they do exist, OSS provides more precise estimates of the interaction effects
than existing methods. The advantages of OSS are also illustrated through
analysis of real data.

Can we draw a connection between these different methods? We formally prove

among the ML community -- we argue that NLP practitioners should, when

$-\alpha(\phi)F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu}/4$, where $F_{\mu
\nu}=\partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}$ is the field strength

reduced Planck mass, there is a branch of charged star solutions with a
nontrivial profile of $\phi$ approaching $0$ toward spatial infinity, besides a
branch of general relativistic solutions with a vanishing scalar field, i.e.,
solutions in the Einstein-Maxwell model. As the ratio $\rho_c/\rho_m$ between
charge density $\rho_c$ and matter density $\rho_m$ increases toward its
maximum value, the mass $M$ of charged stars in general relativity tends to be
enhanced due to the increase of repulsive Coulomb force against gravity. In
this regime, the appearance of nontrivial branches induced by negative $\beta$
of order $-1$ effectively reduces the Coulomb force for a wide range of central
matter densities, leading to charged stars with smaller masses and radii in
comparison to those in the general relativistic branch. Our analysis indicates
that spontaneous scalarization of stars can be induced not only by the coupling
to curvature invariants but also by the scalar-gauge coupling in Einstein
gravity.

gaining popularity for simulating rock fractures due to its ability to handle
complex, discontinuous geometry without an explicit surface tracking algorithm.
None of the existing phase-field models, however, incorporates the impact of
surface roughness on the mechanical response of fractures -- such as elastic
deformability and shear-induced dilation -- despite the importance of this
behavior for subsurface systems. To fill this gap, here we introduce the first
framework for phase-field modeling of rough rock fractures. The framework
transforms a displacement-jump-based discrete constitutive model for
discontinuities into a strain-based continuous model, without any additional
parameter, and then casts it into a phase-field formulation for frictional
interfaces. We illustrate the framework by constructing a particular
phase-field form employing a rock joint model originally formulated for
discrete modeling. The results obtained by the new formulation show excellent
agreement with those of a well-established discrete method for a variety of
problems ranging from shearing of a single discontinuity to compression of
fractured rocks. It is further demonstrated that the phase-field formulation
can well simulate complex crack growth from rough discontinuities.
Consequently, our phase-field framework provides an unprecedented bridge
between a discrete constitutive model for rough discontinuities -- common in
rock mechanics -- and the continuous finite element method -- standard in
computational mechanics -- without any algorithm to explicitly represent
discontinuity geometry.

industry and research community due to its capability of keeping data on local
devices. To aggregate the gradients of local models to train the global model,
existing works require that the global model and the local models are the same.
However, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are inherently diverse regarding
computation speed and onboard memory. In this paper, we propose an FL framework
targeting the heterogeneity of IoT devices. Specifically, local models are
compressed from the global model, and the gradients of the compressed local
models are used to update the global model. We conduct preliminary experiments
to illustrate that our framework can facilitate the design of IoT-aware FL.

effectively enhance the model's robustness against adversarial attacks. The
existing AT methods mainly focused on manipulating the inner maximization for
generating quality adversarial variants or manipulating the outer minimization
for designing effective learning objectives. However, empirical results of AT
always exhibit the robustness at odds with accuracy and the existence of the
cross-over mixture problem, which motivates us to study some label randomness
for benefiting the AT. First, we thoroughly investigate noisy labels (NLs)
injection into AT's inner maximization and outer minimization, respectively and
obtain the observations on when NL injection benefits AT. Second, based on the
observations, we propose a simple but effective method -- NoiLIn that randomly
injects NLs into training data at each training epoch and dynamically increases
the NL injection rate once robust overfitting occurs. Empirically, NoiLIn can
significantly mitigate the AT's undesirable issue of robust overfitting and
even further improve the generalization of the state-of-the-art AT methods.
Philosophically, NoiLIn sheds light on a new perspective of learning with NLs:
NLs should not always be deemed detrimental, and even in the absence of NLs in
the training set, we may consider injecting them deliberately. Codes are
available in https://github.com/zjfheart/NoiLIn.

problem and usually tackled by utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
to integrate information from the input face image and a sequence of sparse
facial landmarks. However, the generated face images usually suffer from
quality loss, image distortion, identity change, and expression mismatching due
to the weak representation capacity of the facial landmarks. In this paper, we
propose to ""imagine"" a face video from a single face image according to the
reconstructed 3D face dynamics, aiming to generate a realistic and
identity-preserving face video, with precisely predicted pose and facial
expression. The 3D dynamics reveal changes of the facial expression and motion,
and can serve as a strong prior knowledge for guiding highly realistic face
video generation. In particular, we explore face video prediction and exploit a
well-designed 3D dynamic prediction network to predict a 3D dynamic sequence
for a single face image. The 3D dynamics are then further rendered by the
sparse texture mapping algorithm to recover structural details and sparse
textures for generating face frames. Our model is versatile for various AR/VR

effectiveness in generating high-fidelity, identity-preserving, and visually

conformally coupled, long range, macroscopic scalar field. And in the static,
spherically symmetric case discuss two classes of exact exterior solutions, in
one of which the scalar field has a constant value and in the other, which is
due to Brihaye and Verbin, it has a radial dependence. In light of these two
solutions Horne and then Hobson and Lasenby raised the concern that the fitting
of conformal gravity to galactic rotation curves had been misapplied and thus
called the successful fitting of the conformal theory into question. We show
that the analysis of Brihaye and Verbin is not actually general, but is
nonetheless valid in the particular case that they studied. For the analyses of
Horne and of Hobson and Lasenby we show that this macroscopic scalar field is
not related to the mass generation that is required in a conformal theory.
Rather, not just in conformal gravity, but also in standard Einstein gravity,
the presence of such a long range scalar field would lead to test particles
whose masses would be of the same order as the masses of the galaxies around
which they orbit. Since particle masses are not at all of this form, such
macroscopic fields cannot be responsible for mass generation; and the existence
of any such mass-generating scalar fields can be excluded, consistent with
there actually being no known massless scalar particles in nature. Instead,
mass generation has to be due to c-number vacuum expectation values of q-number
fields. Such expectation values are microscopic not macroscopic and only vary
within particle interiors, giving particles an extended, baglike structure, as
needed for localization in a conformal theory. And being purely internal they
have no effect on galactic orbits, to thus leave the good conformal gravity
fitting to galactic rotation curves intact.

popular method is the stochastic gradient descent. Viewed as a process for
sampling the loss function landscape, the stochastic gradient descent is known
to prefer flat minima. Though this is desired for certain optimization problems
such as in deep learning, it causes issues when the goal is to find the global
minimum, especially if the global minimum resides in a sharp valley.
  Illustrated with a simple motivating example, we show that the fundamental
reason is that the difference in the Lipschitz constants of multiple terms in
the loss function causes stochastic gradient descent to experience different
variances at different minima. In order to mitigate this effect and perform
faithful optimization, we propose a combined resampling-reweighting scheme to
balance the variance at local minima and extend to general loss functions. We
explain from the numerical stability perspective how the proposed scheme is
more likely to select the true global minimum, and the local convergence
analysis perspective how it converges to a minimum faster when compared with
the vanilla stochastic gradient descent. Experiments from robust statistics and
computational chemistry are provided to demonstrate the theoretical findings.

  Families","20 pages; (v2) Abstract slightly revised",,,,"cs.DS cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  DeepLLL algorithm (Schnorr, 1994) is a famous variant of LLL lattice basis
reduction algorithm, and PotLLL algorithm (Fontein et al., 2014) and $S^2$LLL
algorithm (Yasuda and Yamaguchi, 2019) are recent polynomial-time variants of
DeepLLL algorithm developed from cryptographic applications. However, the known
polynomial bounds for computational complexity are shown only for parameter
$\delta < 1$; for ""optimal"" parameter $\delta = 1$ which ensures the best
output quality, no polynomial bounds are known, and except for LLL algorithm,
it is even not formally proved that the algorithm always halts within finitely
many steps. In this paper, we prove that these four algorithms always halt also
with optimal parameter $\delta = 1$, and furthermore give explicit upper bounds
for the numbers of loops executed during the algorithms. Unlike the known bound
(Akhavi, 2003) applicable to LLL algorithm only, our upper bounds are deduced
in a unified way for all of the four algorithms.

  aqueous drops and vice versa: Interplay of diffusion and barrier mechanisms",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Subject of this work is to investigate the kinetics of mass transfer of
volatile amphiphiles from their vapors to aqueous drops, and from the saturated
aqueous drop solutions to air. The used amphiphiles are benzyl acetate,
linalool, and citronellol. The adequate theoretical processing of the
equilibrium surface tension isotherms is applied to construct the
two-dimensional equation of state, which relates the surface tension to the
adsorption at the interface. The measured surface tension relaxations with time
in the regimes of adsorption from vapor and evaporation from drop combined with
the equations of state provide quantitative information on the change of
adsorption because of the volatile amphiphile mass transfer across the surface.
The theoretical analysis of the diffusion and barrier mechanisms in the case of
adsorption from vapor to the aqueous drop shows that the mixed
barrier-diffusion control in the vapor and diffusion control in the drop
describe experimental data. The obtained values of the adsorption rate
constants are six orders of magnitude larger than those for hexane and
cyclohexane reported in the literature. The regime of evaporation from aqueous
amphiphile solution drop follows the convection-enhanced adsorption mechanism
with desorption rate constant in the vapor affected by the simultaneous water
evaporation and amphiphile desorption. The water evaporation suppresses the
evaporation of linalool and accelerates desorption of benzyl acetate and
citronellol. From viewpoint of applications, the obtained physicochemical
parameters of the studied three fragrances can help for better understanding of
their performance in shampoo systems and perfumes. From theoretical viewpoint,
the result show that by introducing an effective amphiphile desorption rate
constant it is possible to quantify the complex volatile amphiphile desorption
accompanied with the water evaporation.

one-point and two-point functions, and peak/void counts. In particular, KaRMMa

Despite its better pattern matching capability, the GNN initially performs
worse than a simpler previously used learning algorithm. We observe that the
simpler algorithm is less confident, i.e., its recommendations have higher

implemented via the neural network influences the proof search. This is related
to research in human decision-making under uncertainty, and in particular the

language and the measurement method; errors or distortions during the
information acquisition; and the informational cost of processing. This is
called observer-dependent emergence (ODE). In addition, we demonstrate that the
unbounded and fast increase of emergent algorithmic information implies
asymptotically observer-independent emergence (AOIE). Unlike ODE, AOIE is a
type of emergence for which emergent phenomena will remain considered to be
emergent for every formal theory that any observer might devise. We demonstrate
the existence of an evolutionary model that displays the diachronic variant of
AOIE and a network model that displays the holistic variant of AOIE. Our
results show that, restricted to the context of finite discrete deterministic
dynamical systems, computable systems, and irreducible information content
measures, AOIE is the strongest form of emergence that formal theories can
attain.

blockchain assisted FL (BFL) frameworks have employed a third-party blockchain
network to decentralize the model aggregation process. However, decentralized
model aggregation is vulnerable to pooling and collusion attacks from the
third-party blockchain network. Driven by this issue, we propose a novel BFL
framework that features the integration of training and mining at the client

long-term time average (LTA) training data size under a constraint of LTA
energy consumption. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem of
training client selection and resource allocation (i.e., the transmit power and
computation frequency at the client side), and solve the long-term mixed
integer non-linear programming based on a Lyapunov technique. In particular,
the proposed dynamic resource allocation and client scheduling (DRACS)
algorithm can achieve a trade-off of [$\mathcal{O}(1/V)$,
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V})$] to balance the maximization of the LTA training data
size and the minimization of the LTA energy consumption with a control
parameter $V$. Our experimental results show that the proposed DRACS algorithm
achieves better learning accuracy than benchmark client scheduling strategies
with limited time or energy consumption.

unavoidable dissipation, and the final steady-state becomes thermal. However,
to attain such a mixed state, there is no bound for the acceleration of the

for two atoms with the same energy levels. There exists a critical limit of the
acceleration for two atomic detectors, below which the purity of a particular
initial state can be preserved. We observe that the generator of the
dissipative dynamics (Lindbladian) is invariant under a weak symmetry
transformation at this limit. Hence one of the eigenstates of the symmetry
operator is unchanged during the evolution. This kind of state is called a
quantum dark state, which is essentially a decoherence-free subspace. As a
consequence, the system becomes localized, and it can skip the Unruh

granularity of our pruning pattern. Our 1xN pattern prunes these blocks
considered unimportant. We also provide a workflow of filter rearrangement that
first rearranges the weight matrix in the output channel dimension to derive
more influential blocks for accuracy improvements and then applies similar
rearrangement to the next-layer weights in the input channel dimension to
ensure correct convolutional operations. Moreover, the output computation after
our 1xN pruning can be realized via a parallelized block-wise vectorized
operation, leading to significant speedups on general CPUs. The efficacy of our
pruning pattern is proved with experiments on ILSVRC-2012. For example, given
the pruning rate of 50% and N=4, our pattern obtains about 3.0% improvements
over filter pruning in the top-1 accuracy of MobileNet-V2. Meanwhile, it

the smooth conformal structure on surfaces that assigns discrete metrics by
scalar functions defined on vertices. In this paper, we introduce combinatorial
$\alpha$-curvature for discrete conformal structures on polyhedral surfaces,
which is a parameterized generalization of the classical combinatorial
curvature. Then we prove the local and global rigidity of combinatorial
$\alpha$-curvature with respect to discrete conformal structures on polyhedral
surfaces, which confirms parameterized Glickenstein rigidity conjecture. To
study the Yamabe problem for combinatorial $\alpha$-curvature, we introduce
combinatorial $\alpha$-Ricci flow for discrete conformal structures on
polyhedral surfaces, which is a generalization of Chow-Luo's combinatorial
Ricci flow for Thurston's circle packings and Luo's combinatorial Yamabe flow
for vertex scaling on polyhedral surfaces. To handle the potential
singularities of the combinatorial $\alpha$-Ricci flow, we extend the flow
through the singularities by extending the inner angles in triangles by
constants. Under the existence of a discrete conformal structure with
prescribed combinatorial curvature, the solution of extended combinatorial
$\alpha$-Ricci flow is proved to exist for all time and converge exponentially
fast for any initial value. This confirms a parameterized generalization of
another conjecture of Glickenstein on the convergence of combinatorial Ricci
flow, gives an almost equivalent characterization of the solvability of Yamabe
problem for combinatorial $\alpha$-curvature in terms of combinatorial
$\alpha$-Ricci flow and provides an effective algorithm for finding discrete
conformal structures with prescribed combinatorial $\alpha$-curvatures.

applications in real-time traffic management and control. The efficacy of these

approach for online calibration is the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which --
although appealing in its flexibility to incorporate any class of parameters
and measurements -- poses several challenges with regard to calibration
accuracy and scalability, especially in congested situations for large-scale
networks. This paper addresses these issues in turn so as to improve the
accuracy and efficiency of EKF-based online calibration approaches for large
and congested networks. First, the concept of state augmentation is revisited
to handle violations of the Markovian assumption typically implicit in online
applications of the EKF. Second, a method based on graph-coloring is proposed
to operationalize the partitioned finite-difference approach that enhances
scalability of the gradient computations.
  Several synthetic experiments and a real world case study demonstrate that
application of the proposed approaches yields improvements in terms of both
prediction accuracy and computational performance. The work has applications in
real-world deployments of simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment systems.

hard disk drives, biomedical applications as drug delivery, hyperthermia, and

of ferrofluid depends on the volume concentration of magnetic nanoparticles
including surfactant layers. However, under the influence of a stationary
magnetic field, the viscosity of ferrofluid depends on the angle between the
applied magnetic field and vorticity in the flow. If this angle is 90o, then
there is a maximum increase in the viscosity. If the magnetic field and the
vorticity in the flow are parallel to each other, then there is no change in
the viscosity since the applied magnetic field does not change the speed of the
rotation of magnetic nanoparticles in the fluid. The viscosity of ferrofluid in
the presence of an alternating magnetic field demonstrates interesting
behavior. When field frequency matches with the relaxation time, known as
resonance condition, then there is no impact of an alternating magnetic field
in the viscosity of ferrofluid. If the frequency of an alternating magnetic
field is less than resonance frequency, then an alternating magnetic field
increases the viscosity of ferrofluid. Using higher frequency than resonance
condition reduces the viscosity of ferrofluid and researchers reported this

{\deg}C, 975 {\deg}C and 1000 {\deg}C to reveal the influence of temperature
and the resulting diffusion velocity of solutes like Al, W and Ta on the
deformation mechanisms. Two creep rate minima are observed at all temperatures
indicating that the deformation mechanisms causing these minima are quite
similar. Atom-probe tomography analysis reveals elemental segregation to
stacking faults, which had formed in the $\gamma\prime$ phase during creep.
Density-functional-theory calculations indicate segregation of W and Ta to the
stacking fault and an associated considerable reduction of the stacking fault
energy. Since solutes diffuse faster at a higher temperature, segregation can
take place more quickly. This results in a significantly faster softening of
the alloy, since cutting of the $\gamma\prime$ precipitate phase by partial
dislocations is facilitated through segregation already during the early stages
of creep. This is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy analysis.
Therefore, not only the smaller precipitate fraction at higher temperatures is
responsible for the worse creep properties, but also faster diffusion-assisted
shearing of the $\gamma\prime$ phase by partial dislocations. The understanding
of these mechanisms will help in future alloy development by offering new
design criteria.

In this paper, we focus on sparse adversarial attack based on the $\ell_0$ norm
constraint, which can succeed by only modifying a few pixels of an image.
Despite a high attack success rate, prior sparse attack methods achieve a low
transferability under the black-box protocol due to overfitting the target
model. Therefore, we introduce a generator architecture to alleviate the
overfitting issue and thus efficiently craft transferable sparse adversarial
examples. Specifically, the generator decouples the sparse perturbation into
amplitude and position components. We carefully design a random quantization
operator to optimize these two components jointly in an end-to-end way. The
experiment shows that our method has improved the transferability by a large
margin under a similar sparsity setting compared with state-of-the-art methods.
Moreover, our method achieves superior inference speed, 700$\times$ faster than

challenging problem on how to design the functional split configuration. In
this paper, a deep reinforcement learning approach is proposed to optimize

location of functions in the RAN. These functions can be placed either at a
central/cloud unit (CU) or a distributed unit (DU). This problem is formulated
as constrained neural combinatorial reinforcement learning to minimize the
total network cost. In this solution, a policy gradient method with Lagrangian
relaxation is applied that uses a stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) neural

a temperature hyperparameter is applied for the inference process. The results
show that our proposed solution can learn the optimal function split decision

reduce the cost by up to $320\%$ compared to a distributed-RAN (D-RAN). We also
conclude that altering the traffic load and routing cost does not significantly

with desirable attributes such as a given pose, cloth textures, or hairstyles.
However, the large spatial misalignment between source and target images makes
the standard image-to-image translation architectures unsuitable for this task.
Most state-of-the-art methods focus on alignment for global pose-transfer
tasks. However, they fail to deal with region-specific texture-transfer tasks,
especially for person images with complex textures. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel Spatially-Adaptive Warped Normalization (SAWN) which integrates
a learned flow-field to warp modulation parameters. It allows us to efficiently
align person spatially-adaptive styles with pose features. Moreover, we propose
a novel Self-Training Part Replacement (STPR) strategy to refine the model for
the texture-transfer task, which improves the quality of the generated clothes
and the preservation ability of non-target regions. Our experimental results on
the widely used DeepFashion dataset demonstrate a significant improvement of
the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods on pose-transfer and
texture-transfer tasks. The code is available at

years. SNNs are seen as hypothetical solutions for the bottlenecks of ANNs in
pattern recognition, such as energy efficiency. But current methods such as
ANN-to-SNN conversion and back-propagation do not take full advantage of these
networks, and unsupervised methods have not yet reached a success comparable to
advanced artificial neural networks. It is important to study the behavior of
SNNs trained with unsupervised learning methods such as spike-timing dependent
plasticity (STDP) on video classification tasks, including mechanisms to model
motion information using spikes, as this information is critical for video
understanding. This paper presents multiple methods of transposing temporal
information into a static format, and then transforming the visual information
into spikes using latency coding. These methods are paired with two types of
temporal fusion known as early and late fusion, and are used to help the
spiking neural network in capturing the spatio-temporal features from videos.
In this paper, we rely on the network architecture of a convolutional spiking
neural network trained with STDP, and we test the performance of this network
when challenged with action recognition tasks. Understanding how a spiking
neural network responds to different methods of movement extraction and
representation can help reduce the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs. In
this paper we show the effect of the similarity in the shape and speed of
certain actions on action recognition with spiking neural networks, we also
highlight the effectiveness of some methods compared to others.

  Distribution Networks: A Case Study",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Price elasticity model (PEM) is an appealing and modest model for assessing
the potential of flexible demand in DR. It measures the customers demand
sensitivity through elasticity in relation to price variation. However,
application of PEM in DR is partially apprehensible on attributing the
adaptability and adjustability with intertemporal constraints in DR. Thus, this
article presents an adaptive economic DR framework with attributes of DR via a
dynamic elasticity approach to model customers sensitivity. This dynamic
elasticity is modeled through the deterministic and stochastic approaches. Both
approaches envision the notion of load recovery for shiftable/flexible loads to
make the proposed DR framework adaptive and adjustable relative to price
variation. In stochastic approach, a geometric Brownian motion is employed to
emulate load recovery with inclusion of intertemporal constraint of load
flexibility. The proposed mathematical model shows what should be the customers
elasticity value to achieve the factual DR. The case study is carried out on
standard IEEE 33 distribution system bus load data to assess technical and
socio-economic impact of DR on customers and is also compared with the exiting

Continuous-time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs) from time-course data under minimal
experimental resources. In practice, the cost of generating experimental data
poses a bottleneck, especially in the natural and social sciences. A popular
approach to overcome this is Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED).
However, BOED becomes infeasible in high-dimensional settings, as it involves
integration over all possible experimental outcomes. We propose a novel
criterion for experimental design based on a variational approximation of the
expected information gain. We show that for CTBNs, a semi-analytical expression
for this criterion can be calculated for structure and parameter learning. By
doing so, we can replace sampling over experimental outcomes by solving the
CTBNs master-equation, for which scalable approximations exist. This alleviates
the computational burden of sampling possible experimental outcomes in
high-dimensions. We employ this framework in order to recommend interventional
sequences. In this context, we extend the CTBN model to conditional CTBNs in
order to incorporate interventions. We demonstrate the performance of our
criterion on synthetic and real-world data.

instability (KHI) on the heliopause (HP) are examined by means of
two-dimensional hybrid simulations. We assume the supersonic neutral solar wind
as the source of PUIs gyrating about the magnetic field in the outer
heliosheath. These PUIs become energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) via charge
exchange with interstellar hydrogen, and a portion of these ENAs are detected
by spacecraft such as the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX}. To evaluate
the possibility of identifying the KHI on HP from ENA observations, we assume
that an imprint of the KHI may be displayed in spatial and temporal variations
in the observed ENA profile. As an alternative to ENA, the column density of
PUIs integrated across the HP is calculated. The KH-inducing vortex forces not
only background protons but also PUIs to roll up deep in the inner heliosheath.
The KH vortex also results in the emission of magnetosonic pulses that sweep
PUIs in the outer heliosheath and lead to their local confinement. These
effects elongate the PUIs spatial distribution in the direction normal to the
HP. The appearance of the local confined structure in the PUIs column density
is consequently confirmed, and this feature can be confirmed as the KHI
evolution. Although the simulation cannot be quantitatively compared with the
observations currently available because its resolution is too small, we expect
that the derived properties will be useful for diagnosing the nature of HP
fluctuation in future missions.

supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), which was reported about ten years ago,
has generated much debate. Several exotic cooling scenarios have been proposed
using non-standard assumptions about the physics and evolution of this neutron
star (NS). At present, significant corrections have been made to the
observational data, which make it possible to numerically simulate the Cas A NS
cooling process in the framework of the scenario of minimal neutrino cooling.
If there is an additional source of cooling, such as axion emission, the
steepness of the Cas A NS surface temperature drop will increase with the
growth of the axion-nucleon interaction strength. This makes it possible to
limit the minimum value of the axion decay constant $f_a$ using the condition
that the NS surface temperature should be within the 99% confidence interval
obtained from the observational data. Two types of axion models are considered:
the Kim-Shifman-Weinstein-Zakharov -- KSVZ model and the
Dean-Fischler-Srednitsky-Zhitnitsky --DFSZ model. The above criterion gives a
lower limit on the axion decay constant, $f_a>3\times 10^7$ GeV and
$f_a>4.5\times 10^8$ GeV for KSVZ and DFSZ axions, respectively.

development of tractable models that account for the irregular structure of the

several sampling, reconstruction, and recovery problems for signals defined on

assumption is that the (partially) observed signals can be modeled as the
output of a graph filter to a structured (parsimonious) input graph signal.
When either the input or the filter coefficients are known, this is tantamount
to assuming that the signals of interest live on a subspace defined by the
supporting graph. When neither is known, the model becomes bilinear. Upon
imposing different priors and additional structure on either the input or the
filter coefficients, a broad range of relevant problem formulations arise. The
goal is then to leverage those priors, the shift operator of the supporting
graph, and the samples of the signal of interest to recover: the signal at the
non-sampled nodes (graph-signal interpolation), the input (deconvolution), the
filter coefficients (system identification), or any combination thereof (blind

promising approach to solving long-horizon tasks. Recently, its success has

exploration ability by decomposing tasks via subgoals, existing GCHRL methods
struggle in temporally extended tasks with sparse external rewards, since the
high-level policy learning relies on external rewards. As the high-level policy
selects subgoals in an online learned representation space, the dynamic change
of the subgoal space severely hinders effective high-level exploration. In this
paper, we propose a novel regularization that contributes to both stable and
efficient subgoal representation learning. Building upon the stable
representation, we design measures of novelty and potential for subgoals, and
develop an active hierarchical exploration strategy that seeks out new
promising subgoals and states without intrinsic rewards. Experimental results

selectively focusing on a discrete aspect of sensory cues while disregarding
other perceivable information. This biological mechanism, more specifically
saliency detection, has long been used in multimedia indexing to drive the
analysis only on relevant parts of images or videos for further processing.
  The recent advent of silicon retinas (or event cameras -- sensors that
measure pixel-wise changes in brightness and output asynchronous events
accordingly) raises the question of how to adapt attention and saliency to the
unconventional type of such sensors' output. Silicon retina aims to reproduce
the biological retina behaviour. In that respect, they produce punctual events
in time that can be construed as neural spikes and interpreted as such by a
neural network.
  In particular, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent an asynchronous type
of artificial neural network closer to biology than traditional artificial
networks, mainly because they seek to mimic the dynamics of neural membrane and
action potentials over time. SNNs receive and process information in the form
of spike trains. Therefore, they make for a suitable candidate for the
efficient processing and classification of incoming event patterns measured by
silicon retinas. In this paper, we review the biological background behind the
attentional mechanism, and introduce a case study of event videos

quantum state can often be expensive. One prominent example is the real-time
time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), a widely used framework
for the first principle description of many-electron dynamics in chemical and
materials systems. Practical rt-TDDFT calculations often avoid the direct
simulation of the von Neumann equation, and solve instead a set of
Schr\""odinger equations, of which the dynamics is equivalent to that of the von
Neumann equation. However, the time step size employed by the Schr\""odinger
dynamics is often much smaller. In order to improve the time step size and the
overall efficiency of the simulation, we generalize a recent work of the
parallel transport (PT) dynamics for simulating pure states [An, Lin,
Multiscale Model. Simul. 18, 612, 2020] to general quantum states. The PT
dynamics provides the optimal gauge choice, and can employ a time step size
comparable to that of the von Neumann dynamics. Going beyond the linear and
near adiabatic regime in previous studies, we find that the error of the PT
dynamics can be bounded by certain commutators between Hamiltonians, density
matrices, and their derived quantities. Such a commutator structure is not
present in the Schr\""odinger dynamics. We demonstrate that the parallel
transport-implicit midpoint (PT-IM) method is a suitable method for simulating
the PT dynamics, especially when the spectral radius of the Hamiltonian is
large. The commutator structure of the error bound, and numerical results for

advantage of the PT dynamics.

$MnF_{4}$ monolayer is also characterized by strongly uniaxial magnetic
anisotropic behavior, that can be manipulated by the reversible ferroelastic
strain and carrier doping. Remarkably, the carrier doping not only leads to an
antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transformation, bult also could switch
the easy magnetization axis between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions.
In addition, the N\'eel temperature was evaluated to be about 140 K from the
Monte Carlo simulations based on the Heisenberg model. The combination of

difficult to handle these nonuniform blurred images. To this end, this study
designs a novel blur-aware multi-branch network (BaMBNet), in which different

particular, we estimate the blur amounts of different regions by the internal
geometric constraint of the DP data, which measures the defocus disparity

leverage different networks with different capacities (\emph{i.e.} parameters)

Internet-of-Things (IoT) into our daily life, while their minimalist design
also makes IoT devices vulnerable to many active attacks. Recent advances use
an antenna array to extract fine-grained physical-layer signatures to identify
the attackers, which adds burdens in terms of energy and hardware cost to IoT
devices. In this paper, we present ShieldScatter, a lightweight system that
attaches low-cost tags to single-antenna devices to shield the system from
active attacks. The key insight of ShieldScatter is to intentionally create
multi-path propagation signatures with the careful deployment of tags. These
signatures can be used to construct a sensitive profile to identify the
location of the signals' arrival, and thus detect the threat. In addition, we
also design a tag-random scheme and a multiple receivers combination approach
to detect a powerful attacker who has the strong priori knowledge of the
legitimate user. We prototype ShieldScatter with USRPs and tags to evaluate our
system in various environments. The results show that even when the powerful
attacker is close to the legitimate device, ShieldScatter can mitigate 95% of
attack attempts while triggering false alarms on just 7% of legitimate traffic.

habitable zone using the radial velocity method, attracting the attention of
many ongoing surveys. As a by-product of these surveys, new multiple stellar
systems are also found. This is the case also for the CARMENES survey, from
which nine new SB2 systems have already been announced. Throughout the five
years of the survey, the accumulation of new observations has resulted in the
detection of several new multiple stellar systems with long periods and low
radial-velocity amplitudes. Here, we newly characterise the spectroscopic
orbits and constrain the masses of eight systems and update the properties of a
system that we reported earlier.
  We derive the radial velocities of the stars using two-dimensional cross
correlation techniques and template matching. The measurements are modelled to
determine the orbital parameters of the systems. We combine CARMENES
spectroscopic observations with archival high-resolution spectra from other
instruments to increase the time-span of the observations and improve our
analysis. When available, we also added archival photometric, astrometric, and
adaptive optics imaging data to constrain the rotation periods and absolute
masses of the components.
  We determine the spectroscopic orbits of nine multiple systems, eight of
which are presented for the first time. The sample is composed of five SB1s,
two SB2s, and two ST3s. The companions of two of the single-line binaries, GJ
3626 and GJ 912, have minimum masses below the stellar boundary and, thus,
could be brown dwarfs. We find a new white dwarf in a close binary orbit around
the M star GJ 207.1. From a global fit to radial velocities and astrometric
measurements, we are able to determine the absolute masses of the components of
GJ 282C, which is one of the youngest systems with measured dynamical masses.

achieving high performance at significantly less energy consumption compared to

cancer death in the United States. Predicting tumors like PDACs (including both
classification and segmentation) from medical images by deep learning is
becoming a growing trend, but usually a large number of annotated data are
required for training, which is very labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
this paper, we consider a partially supervised setting, where cheap image-level
annotations are provided for all the training data, and the costly per-voxel
annotations are only available for a subset of them. We propose an Inductive
Attention Guidance Network (IAG-Net) to jointly learn a global image-level
classifier for normal/PDAC classification and a local voxel-level classifier
for semi-supervised PDAC segmentation. We instantiate both the global and the
local classifiers by multiple instance learning (MIL), where the attention
guidance, indicating roughly where the PDAC regions are, is the key to bridging
them: For global MIL based normal/PDAC classification, attention serves as a
weight for each instance (voxel) during MIL pooling, which eliminates the
distraction from the background; For local MIL based semi-supervised PDAC
segmentation, the attention guidance is inductive, which not only provides
bag-level pseudo-labels to training data without per-voxel annotations for MIL
training, but also acts as a proxy of an instance-level classifier.
Experimental results show that our IAG-Net boosts PDAC segmentation accuracy by
more than 5% compared with the state-of-the-arts.

The vast
majority burn up harmlessly during the descent, but the larger objects survive,
occasionally experiencing intense fragmentation events, and reach the ground.
These events can pose a threat for a village or a small city; therefore, models
of asteroid fragmentation, along with accurate post-breakup trajectory and
strewn field estimation, are needed to enable a reliable risk assessment. In
this work, a methodology to describe meteoroids entry, fragmentation, descent,
and strewn field is presented by means of a continuum approach. At breakup, a
modified version of the NASA Standard Breakup Model is used to generate the
distribution of the fragments in terms of their area-to-mass ratio and ejection
velocity. This distribution, combined with the meteoroid state, is directly
propagated using the continuity equation coupled with the non-linear entry
dynamics. At each time step, the probability density evolution of the fragments
is reconstructed using GMM interpolation. Using this information is then
possible to estimate the meteoroid's ground impact probability. This approach
departs from the current state-of-the-art models: it has the flexibility to
include large fragmentation events while maintaining a continuum formulation
for a better physical representation of the phenomenon. The methodology is also
characterised by a modular structure, so that updated asteroids fragmentation
models can be readily integrated into the framework, allowing a continuously
improving prediction of re-entry and fragmentation events. The propagation of
the fragments' density and its reconstruction, currently considering only one
fragmentation point, is first compared against Monte Carlo simulations, and
then against real observations. Both deceleration due to atmospheric drag and
ablation due to aerothermodynamics effects have been considered.

trends, we performed a database search. We note a surprisingly late adoption of
deep learning that starts in 2018. The introduction of deep learning has not
yet solved the greatest challenge of TRL: generalization. Transfer between
different domains works well when domains have strong similarities (e.g.
MountainCar to Cartpole), and most TRL publications focus on different tasks
within the same domain that have few differences. Most TRL applications we
encountered compare their improvements against self-defined baselines, and the
field is still missing unified benchmarks. We consider this to be a
disappointing situation. For the future, we note that: (1) A clear measure of
task similarity is needed. (2) Generalization needs to improve. Promising
approaches merge deep learning with planning via MCTS or introduce memory
through LSTMs. (3) The lack of benchmarking tools will be remedied to enable
meaningful comparison and measure progress. Already Alchemy and Meta-World are
emerging as interesting benchmark suites. We note that another development, the
increase in procedural content generation (PCG), can improve both benchmarking

rely on any labeled task data. Among existing work, a popular solution is to
use pre-trained language models to score candidate choices directly conditioned
on the question or context. However, such scores from language models can be
easily affected by irrelevant factors, such as word frequencies, sentence
structures, etc. These distracting factors may not only mislead the model to
choose a wrong answer but also make it oversensitive to lexical perturbations
in candidate answers.
  In this paper, we present a novel SEmantic-based Question Answering method
(SEQA) for unsupervised commonsense question answering. Instead of directly
scoring each answer choice, our method first generates a set of plausible
answers with generative models (e.g., GPT-2), and then uses these plausible
answers to select the correct choice by considering the semantic similarity
between each plausible answer and each choice. We devise a simple, yet sound
formalism for this idea and verify its effectiveness and robustness with
extensive experiments. We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark
datasets, and our method achieves the best results in unsupervised settings.
Moreover, when attacked by TextFooler with synonym replacement, SEQA
demonstrates much less performance drops than baselines, thereby indicating
stronger robustness.

complementary way towards robustness is to introduce a rejection option,

confidence is a commonly used certainty proxy. Along with this routine, we find
that confidence and a rectified confidence (R-Con) can form two coupled

coupling strategies to better detect and reject adversarial examples. We
evaluate our rectified rejection (RR) module on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10-C, and

thermodynamic quantities can be obtained. Making use of the Abel-Plana formula,
these thermodynamic quantities can be expanded as power series with respect to
the dimensionless variable $b=2eB/T^{2}$. The zero-field magnetic
susceptibility is expanded at zero mass, and the leading order term is
logarithmic. We also calculate scalar, vector current, axial vector current and
energy-momentum tensor of the system through ensemble average approach. Mass
correction to chiral separation effect is discussed. For massless chiral
fermions, our results recover the chiral magnetic effect for right- and
left-handed fermions, as well as chiral separation effect.

limitations of previous observations. The ALMA Large Program to INvestigate
[CII] at Early Times (ALPINE), which targeted 118 UV-selected star-forming
galaxies at 4.4<z<5.9, provides a new opportunity to tackle this issue for the
first time with a statistically robust dataset. We have exploited the
rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) fluxes of the 23 continuum individually detected
galaxies and stacks of continuum images to measure the dust content of the 118
UV-selected ALPINE galaxies. We have focused on the dust scaling relations and,
by comparing them with predictions from chemical evolution models, we have
probed the evolutionary stage of UV-selected galaxies at high-z. By using the
observed correlation between the UV-luminosity and the dust mass, we have
estimated the DMD of UV-selected galaxies at z~5, weighting the galaxies by
means of the UV-luminosity function (UVLF). The derived DMD has been compared
with the value we have estimated from the 10 ALPINE far-IR continuum blindly
detected galaxies at the redshift of the ALPINE targets. The comparison of the
observed dust scaling relations with chemical evolution models suggests that
ALPINE galaxies are not likely progenitors of disc galaxies, but of
intermediate and low mass proto-spheroids, resulting in present-day bulges of
spiral or elliptical galaxies. Interestingly, this conclusion is in line with
the independent morphological analysis, that shows that the majority (~70\%) of
the dust-continuum detected galaxies have a disturbed morphology. The DMD
obtained at z~5 from UV-selected sources is ~30% of the value obtained from
blind far-IR selected sources, showing that the UV-selection misses the most
dust-rich, UV-obscured galaxies.

natural language utterance. Currently, among dominant models, it is treated as
a sequence-to-tree task, where a decoder outputs a sequence of actions
corresponding to the pre-order traversal of an Abstract Syntax Tree. However,
such a decoder only exploits the preorder traversal based preceding actions,
which are insufficient to ensure correct action predictions. In this paper, we
first throughly analyze the context modeling difference between neural code
generation models with different traversals based decodings (preorder traversal
vs breadth-first traversal), and then propose to introduce a mutual learning
framework to jointly train these models. Under this framework, we continuously
enhance both two models via mutual distillation, which involves synchronous
executions of two one-to-one knowledge transfers at each training step. More
specifically, we alternately choose one model as the student and the other as
its teacher, and require the student to fit the training data and the action
prediction distributions of its teacher. By doing so, both models can fully
absorb the knowledge from each other and thus could be improved simultaneously.
Experimental results and in-depth analysis on several benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We release our code at

models (RVM's), which can be motivated in the context of Quantum Field Theory
in curved spacetime. They consider the possibility of a smoothly evolving
vacuum energy density that inherits its time-dependence from cosmological
variables, such as the Hubble rate and its time derivative. The analysis
presented, however, is not limited only to the dynamical vacuum models but
considers also models of dark energy such as the Peebles \& Ratra scalar field
model or simple parameterizations like the XCDM or the CPL. Their theoretical
predictions are tested against the wealth of cosmological data and a fitting
procedure is carried out in order to obtain constraints over the free

that using the turbulent Reynolds number rather than the velocity as a control

This work does not use any group action on buildings, although in the end all
the results can be stated within the framework of the Bruhat-Tits theory of
semisimple groups over non-Archimedean local fields. This choice should allow
the use of these building compactifications in intriguing geometric group
theory situations, where only lattice actions are available. The choice
avoiding the use of a group action requires going back to certain more
classical compactification procedures. The compactified spaces we obtain use
and, at the same time, make it possible to understand geometrically the
descriptions of asymptotic behavior of kernels resulting from the
non-Archimedean harmonic analysis on affine buildings.

generation tasks that takes multiple sources, including automatic post-editing,
multi-source translation, multi-document summarization, etc. As MSG tasks
suffer from the data scarcity problem and recent pretrained models have been
proven to be effective for low-resource downstream tasks, transferring
pretrained sequence-to-sequence models to MSG tasks is essential. Although
directly finetuning pretrained models on MSG tasks and concatenating multiple
sources into a single long sequence is regarded as a simple method to transfer
pretrained models to MSG tasks, we conjecture that the direct finetuning method
leads to catastrophic forgetting and solely relying on pretrained
self-attention layers to capture cross-source information is not sufficient.
Therefore, we propose a two-stage finetuning method to alleviate the
pretrain-finetune discrepancy and introduce a novel MSG model with a fine
encoder to learn better representations in MSG tasks. Experiments show that our
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on the WMT17 APE task and
multi-source translation task using the WMT14 test set. When adapted to
document-level translation, our framework outperforms strong baselines
significantly.

Moreno-Pulido (2019,2020) have pointed out the intriguing possibility that
Brans-Dicke cosmology with constant vacuum energy density (BD-$\Lambda$CDM) may
be able to alleviate the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions that are found in the
framework of the concordance cosmological model (GR-$\Lambda$CDM). The fitting
analyses presented in these works indicate a preference for values of the
effective gravitational coupling appearing in the Friedmann equation, $G$,
about $4-9\%$ larger than Newton's constant (as measured on Earth), and mildy
evolving with the expansion of the universe. The signal reaches the $\sim
3.5\sigma$ c.l. when the prior on $H_0$ from SH0ES and the angular diameter
distances to strong gravitationally lensed quasars measured by H0LICOW are
considered, and the $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. when only the former is included. Thus,
the improvement in the description of the cosmological datasets relies on the
existence of a mechanism capable of screening the modified gravity effects at
those scales where deviations from standard General Relativity (GR) are highly
constrained, as in the Solar System. In this paper we explore several
extensions of BD-$\Lambda$CDM that can leave the cosmological evolution
basically unaltered at the background and linear perturbations level, while
being able to screen the Brans-Dicke effects inside the regions of interest,
leading to standard GR. We search for weak-field solutions around spherical
static massive objects with no internal pressure and show that, unfortunately,
these mechanisms can only explain very tiny departures of the effective
cosmological gravitational coupling from the one measured locally. This might
hinder the ability of BD-$\Lambda$CDM to alleviate the cosmological tensions.

in many areas where trust in ML models decision is key to their
accreditation/adoption. The ability to explain models decisions also allows to
provide diagnosis in addition to the model decision, which is highly valuable
in scenarios such as fault detection. Unfortunately, high-performance models do
not exhibit the necessary transparency to make their decisions fully
understandable. And the black-boxes approaches, which are used to explain such
model decisions, suffer from a lack of accuracy in tracing back the exact cause
of a model decision regarding a given input. Indeed, they do not have the
ability to explicitly describe the decision regions of the model around that
input, which is necessary to determine what influences the model towards one
decision or the other. We thus asked ourselves the question: is there a
category of high-performance models among the ones currently used for which we
could explicitly and exactly characterise the decision regions in the input
feature space using a geometrical characterisation? Surprisingly we came out
with a positive answer for any model that enters the category of tree ensemble
models, which encompasses a wide range of high-performance models such as
XGBoost, LightGBM, random forests ... We could derive an exact geometrical
characterisation of their decision regions under the form of a collection of
multidimensional intervals. This characterisation makes it straightforward to
compute the optimal counterfactual (CF) example associated with a query point.
We demonstrate several possibilities of the approach, such as computing the CF
example based only on a subset of features. This allows to obtain more
plausible explanations by adding prior knowledge about which variables the user
can control. An adaptation to CF reasoning on regression problems is also
envisaged.

strong Coulomb interactions, enhanced by dielectric confinement. When the

Coulomb repulsions which shape the electronic structure. To illustrate this
point, the shell filling of type-I (CdSe/CdS) and type-II (CdSe/CdTe)
core/crown nanoplatelets with up to 4 electrons or holes is investigated
theoretically. We find that Coulomb repulsions enable addition energies
exceeding room temperature thermal energy and promote the occupation of
high-spin states. For charged excitons and biexcitons in CdSe/CdTe
nanoplatelets, the repulsions further give rise to multi-peaked emission
spectra with widely tunable (over 100 meV) energy, and a transition from
type-II to quasi-type-II band profile as the number of electrons confined in

their breakthrough moment when applied to a broad range of robotic manipulation
tasks. This is partly due to the fact that reinforcement learning algorithms
are notoriously difficult and time consuming to train, which is exacerbated
when training from images rather than full-state inputs. As humans perform
manipulation tasks, our eyes closely monitor every step of the process with our
gaze focusing sequentially on the objects being manipulated. With this in mind,
we present our Attention-driven Robotic Manipulation (ARM) algorithm, which is
a general manipulation algorithm that can be applied to a range of
sparse-rewarded tasks, given only a small number of demonstrations. ARM splits
the complex task of manipulation into a 3 stage pipeline: (1) a Q-attention
agent extracts relevant pixel locations from RGB and point cloud inputs, (2) a
next-best pose agent that accepts crops from the Q-attention agent and outputs
poses, and (3) a control agent that takes the goal pose and outputs joint
actions. We show that current learning algorithms fail on a range of RLBench
tasks, whilst ARM is successful.

The analysis of the whole Kepler light curve, corrected for the binary effects,
reveals a rich oscillation spectrum with 590 significant frequency peaks, 207
of which are independent. In addition to typical $\delta$ Sct frequencies, we
find small-amplitude signals in the low-frequency range that, most probably,
are a manifestation of gravity-mode pulsations. We perform binary-evolution
computations for this system in order to find an acceptable model describing
its current stage. Our models show that the binary KIC 10661783 was formed by a
rapid, almost conservative, mass transfer that heavily affected the evolution
of both components in the past. One of the most important effects of binary
evolution is the enormous enrichment of the outer layers of the main component
with helium. This fact profoundly influences the pulsational properties of
$\delta$ Scuti star models. For the first time, we demonstrate the effect of
binary evolution on pulsational instability. We construct pulsational models of
the main component in order to account for the mode instability of the observed
frequencies. Whereas the single-star evolution model is pulsational stable in
the whole frequency range, its binary-evolution counterpart has unstable modes,
both, in high and low-frequency range. However, to obtain instability in almost
a whole range of the observed frequencies, the modification of the mean opacity
at the depth corresponding to temperatures log T = 4.69 K and log T = 5.06 K
was necessary.

timely means for disseminating new ideas and cutting-edge works.The importance
of conferences in scientific areas is testified by quantitative indicators. In
Computer Science, for instance, almost two out of three papers published on
Scopus are conference papers. Objective/Purpose: The main goal of this paper is
to investigate a novel research question: is there any correlation between the
impact of a scientific conference and the venue where it took place? Approach:
In order to measure the impact of conferences we conducted a large scale
analysis on the bibliographic data extracted from 3,838 Computer Science
conference series and over 2.5 million papers spanning more than 30 years of
research. To quantify the ""touristicity"" of a venue we exploited some
indicators such as the size of the Wikipedia page for the city hosting the
venue and other indexes from reports of the World Economic Forum.
Results/Findings: We found out that the two aspects are related, and the
correlation with conference impact is stronger when considering country-wide
touristic indicators, such as the Travel&Tourism Competitiveness Index.
More-over the almost linear correlation with the Tourist Service Infrastructure
index attests the specific importance of tourist/accommodation facilities in a
given country. Conclusions: This is the first attempt to focus on the
relationship of venue characteristics to conference papers. The results open up
new possibilities, such as allowing conference organizers and authors to
estimate in advance the impact of conferences, thus supporting them in their
decisions.

high performance on many different natural language processing tasks.
Unfortunately, transformers suffer from long inference times which greatly
increases costs in production. One possible solution is to use knowledge
distillation, which solves this problem by transferring information from large
teacher models to smaller student models. Knowledge distillation maintains high
performance and reaches high compression rates, nevertheless, the size of the
student model is fixed after pre-training and can not be changed individually
for a given downstream task and use-case to reach a desired performance/speedup
ratio. Another solution to reduce the size of models in a much more
fine-grained and computationally cheaper fashion is to prune layers after the
pre-training. The price to pay is that the performance of layer-wise pruning
algorithms is not on par with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods.
In this paper, Greedy-layer pruning is introduced to (1) outperform current
state-of-the-art for layer-wise pruning, (2) close the performance gap when
compared to knowledge distillation, while (3) providing a method to adapt the
model size dynamically to reach a desired performance/speedup tradeoff without
the need of additional pre-training phases. Our source code is available on

stroboscopic conductance of pulsed coupling to leads used to identify a

that the sum of DC conductance at voltages multiples of the driving frequency
is quantitatively close to the stroboscopic conductance at all voltage biases.
This is consistent with previous work which indicated that the summed
conductance at zero/pi resonance is quantized. We quantify the difference
between the two in terms of the width of their respective resonances and
analyze that difference for two different stroboscopic driving protocols of the

find that generically the discrepancy is larger when the zero mode weight at

configuring the resources allocated to their function invocations by either
coupling memory and CPU resources together or providing no knobs at all. These
configuration choices simplify resource allocation decisions on behalf of
users, but at the same time, create deployments that are resource inefficient.
  In this paper, we take a principled approach to the problem of resource
allocation for serverless functions, allowing this choice to be made in an
automatic way that leads to the best combination of performance and cost. In
particular, we systematically explore the opportunities that come with
decoupling memory and CPU resource allocations and also enabling the use of
different VM types. We find a rich trade-off space between performance and
cost. The provider can use this in a number of ways: from exposing all these
parameters to the user, to eliciting preferences for performance and cost from
users, or by simply offering the same performance with lower cost. This
flexibility can also enable the provider to optimize its resource utilization
and enable a cost-effective service with predictable performance.
  Our results show that, by decoupling memory and CPU allocation, there is
potential to have up to 40% lower execution cost than the preset coupled
configurations that are the norm in current serverless offerings. Similarly,
making the correct choice of VM instance type can provide up to 50% better
execution time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that providers can utilize
different instance types for the same functions to maximize resource
utilization while providing performance within 10-20% of the best resource
configuration for each respective function.

a variety of important tasks. At the cornerstone of the Transformer
architecture is the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism which models pairwise
interactions between the elements of the sequence. Despite its massive success,
the current framework ignores interactions among different heads, leading to
the problem that many of the heads are redundant in practice, which greatly
wastes the capacity of the model. To improve parameter efficiency, we
re-formulate the MHA as a latent variable model from a probabilistic
perspective. We present cascaded head-colliding attention (CODA) which
explicitly models the interactions between attention heads through a
hierarchical variational distribution. We conduct extensive experiments and
demonstrate that CODA outperforms the transformer baseline, by $0.6$ perplexity
on \texttt{Wikitext-103} in language modeling, and by $0.6$ BLEU on
\texttt{WMT14 EN-DE} in machine translation, due to its improvements on the

amounts to a change exceeding $10\,{\rm min}$ for ten targets at the time of
JWST's launch, including a $72\,{\rm min}$ change for WASP-56. The measured
transit mid-times for both literature light curves and our new photometry show

the monatomic chain and the mass-disordered chain of
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\beta$ under different strains in the thermodynamic

in qualitatively different thermalization processes for the two kinds of
chains. However, for both cases, the thermalization time follows the same law
-- it is inversely proportional to the square of the nonintegrability strength.
This result suggests that pressure can significantly change the integrability

based statistical model that represents a 3D face using linear basis functions,
has shown promising results for reconstructing 3D faces from single-view
in-the-wild images. However, 3DMM has restricted representation power due to
the limited number of 3D scans and the global linear basis. To address the
limitations of 3DMM, we propose a straightforward learning-based method that
reconstructs a 3D face mesh through Free-Form Deformation (FFD) for the first
time. FFD is a geometric modeling method that embeds a reference mesh within a
parallelepiped grid and deforms the mesh by moving the sparse control points of
the grid. As FFD is based on mathematically defined basis functions, it has no
limitation in representation power. Thus, we can recover accurate 3D face
meshes by estimating appropriate deviation of control points as deformation
parameters. Although both 3DMM and FFD are parametric models, it is difficult
to predict the effect of the 3DMM parameters on the face shape, while the
deformation parameters of FFD are interpretable in terms of their effect on the
final shape of the mesh. This practical advantage of FFD allows the resulting
mesh and control points to serve as a good starting point for 3D face modeling,
in that ordinary users can fine-tune the mesh by using widely available 3D
software tools. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate how our method
successfully estimates the 3D face geometry and facial expressions from 2D face
images, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

learning. They enable scalable approximate posterior inference in
latent-variable models using variational inference (VI). A VAE posits a
variational family parameterized by a deep neural network called an encoder
that takes data as input. This encoder is shared across all the observations,
which amortizes the cost of inference. However the encoder of a VAE has the
undesirable property that it maps a given observation and a
semantics-preserving transformation of it to different latent representations.
This ""inconsistency"" of the encoder lowers the quality of the learned
representations, especially for downstream tasks, and also negatively affects
generalization. In this paper, we propose a regularization method to enforce
consistency in VAEs. The idea is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence between the variational distribution when conditioning on the
observation and the variational distribution when conditioning on a random
semantic-preserving transformation of this observation. This regularization is
applicable to any VAE. In our experiments we apply it to four different VAE
variants on several benchmark datasets and found it always improves the quality
of the learned representations but also leads to better generalization. In
particular, when applied to the Nouveau Variational Auto-Encoder (NVAE), our
regularization method yields state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and
CIFAR-10. We also applied our method to 3D data and found it learns
representations of superior quality as measured by accuracy on a downstream

demonstrate that larger encoder variances reduce the high frequency content of

effectively induces a soft Lipschitz constraint on the decoder network of a
VAE, which is a core contributor to the adversarial robustness of VAEs. We
further demonstrate that adding Gaussian noise to the input of a VAE allows us
to more finely control the frequency content and the Lipschitz constant of the

in many domains requiring data management systems to support time series as a
native data type. A crucial prerequisite of these systems is time series
matching, which still is a challenging problem. A time series is a
high-dimensional data type, its representation is storage-, and its comparison
is time-consuming. Among the representation techniques that tackle these
challenges, the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) is the current state of
the art. This technique reduces a time series to a low-dimensional space by
segmenting it and discretizing each segment into a small symbolic alphabet.
However, SAX ignores the deterministic behavior of time series such as cyclical
repeating patterns or trend component affecting all segments and leading to a
distortion of the symbolic distribution. In this paper, we present a season-
and a trend-aware symbolic approximation. We show that this improves the
symbolic distribution and increase the representation accuracy without
increasing its memory footprint. Most importantly, this enables a more
efficient time series matching by providing a match up to three orders of
magnitude faster than SAX.

$\mathcal{U}^0 (M)$, of the set of unitary elements, $\mathcal{U} (M)$, in a
unital JB$^*$-algebra $M$. We arrive to the conclusion that, as in the case of
unital C$^*$-algebras, $$\begin{aligned}\mathcal{U}^0(M) &=
M^{-1}_{\textbf{1}}\cap\mathcal{U} (M) =\left\lbrace U_{e^{i h_n}}\cdots
U_{e^{i h_1}}(\textbf{1}) \colon \begin{array}{c}
  n\in \mathbb{N}, \ h_j\in M_{sa}
  \forall\ 1\leq j \leq n
  \end{array}
  \right\rbrace \end{aligned}$$ is analytically arcwise connected. Our second
goal is to provide a complete description of the surjective isometries between
the principal components of two unital JB$^*$-algebras $M$ and $N$. Contrary to
the case of unital C$^*$-algebras, we shall deduce the existence of connected
components in $\mathcal{U} (M)$ which are not isometric as metric spaces. We
shall also establish necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee that a
surjective isometry $\Delta: \mathcal{U}(M)\to \mathcal{U} (N)$ admits an
extension to a surjective linear isometry between $M$ and $N$, a conclusion
which is not always true. Among the consequences it is proved that $M$ and $N$
are Jordan $^*$-isomorphic if, and only if, their principal components are
isometric as metric spaces if, and only if, there exists a surjective isometry
$\Delta: \mathcal{U}(M)\to \mathcal{U}(N)$ mapping the unit of $M$ to an
element in $\mathcal{U}^0(N)$. These results provide an extension to the
setting of unital JB$^*$-algebras of the results obtained by O. Hatori for
unital C$^*$-algebras.

been demonstrated to produce biased results. Some research works have been done
in automatically generating test cases to reveal unfairness in SA systems, but
the community still lacks tools that can monitor and uncover biased predictions
at runtime. This paper fills this gap by proposing BiasRV, the first tool to
raise an alarm when a deployed SA system makes a biased prediction on a given
input text. To implement this feature, BiasRV dynamically extracts a template
from an input text and from the template generates gender-discriminatory
mutants (semantically-equivalent texts that only differ in gender information).
Based on popular metrics used to evaluate the overall fairness of an SA system,
we define distributional fairness property for an individual prediction of an
SA system. This property specifies a requirement that for one piece of text,
mutants from different gender classes should be treated similarly as a whole.
Verifying the distributional fairness property causes much overhead to the
running system. To run more efficiently, BiasRV adopts a two-step heuristic:
(1) sampling several mutants from each gender and checking if the system
predicts them as of the same sentiment, (2) checking distributional fairness
only when sampled mutants have conflicting results. Experiments show that
compared to directly checking the distributional fairness property for each
input text, our two-step heuristic can decrease overhead used for analyzing
mutants by 73.81% while only resulting in 6.7% of biased predictions being
missed. Besides, BiasRV can be used conveniently without knowing the
implementation of SA systems. Future researchers can easily extend BiasRV to
detect more types of bias, e.g. race and occupation.

r-STSF builds an ensemble of randomized trees using the discriminatory

sub-series enable interpretable classifications. Experiments on extensive

leading to stronger context prediction ability than single-direction NMT
models. By taking advantage of the dual learning scheme, we further design a
novel feature to directly encode the translated target information without

enabled by the availability of large-scale, high-quality training datasets.
Despite such rapid progress and widespread application, extractive reading
comprehension datasets in languages other than English remain scarce, and
creating such a sufficient amount of training data for each language is costly
and even impossible. An alternative to creating large-scale high-quality
monolingual span-extraction training datasets is to develop multilingual
modeling approaches and systems which can transfer to the target language
without requiring training data in that language. In this paper, in order to
solve the scarce availability of extractive reading comprehension training data
in the target language, we propose a multilingual extractive reading
comprehension approach called XLRC by simultaneously modeling the existing
extractive reading comprehension training data in a multilingual environment
using self-adaptive attention and multilingual attention. Specifically, we
firstly construct multilingual parallel corpora by translating the existing
extractive reading comprehension datasets (i.e., CMRC 2018) from the target
language (i.e., Chinese) into different language families (i.e., English).
Secondly, to enhance the final target representation, we adopt self-adaptive
attention (SAA) to combine self-attention and inter-attention to extract the
semantic relations from each pair of the target and source languages.
Furthermore, we propose multilingual attention (MLA) to learn the rich
knowledge from various language families. Experimental results show that our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline (i.e., RoBERTa_Large) on the

demonstrate that the new features can help CrossASR++ discover more failed test

(18{\alpha}calcite/H2O) is an important quantity in stable isotope geochemistry
and allows in principle to infer temperature variations from carbonate
{\delta}18O if carbonate formation occurred in thermodynamic equilibrium. For
this reason, many studies intended to determine the value of the oxygen isotope
fractionation factor between calcite and water (18{\alpha}calcite/H2O) for a
wide range of temperatures using modern cave calcite and the corresponding cave
drip water or ancient speleothem carbonate and fluid inclusion samples.
However, the picture that emerges from all of these studies indicates that
speleothem calcite is not formed in thermodynamic equilibrium but under kinetic
conditions, provoking a large variability of determined 18{\alpha}calcite/H2O
values. Here we present a conceptual framework that can explain the variability
of 18{\alpha}calcite/H2O values obtained by cave studies. Prior calcite
precipitation (PCP) is calcite precipitation before cave drip water is dripping
from the cave ceiling and impinges on the surface of a stalagmite or watch
glass. Prior to the karst water dripping from the cave ceiling, PCP can occur
in the karst above the cave as well as on the cave ceiling, the cave walls and
on the surface of stalactites. We argue that PCP leads to increasing the
{\delta}18O value of the dissolved HCO3- ({\delta}18OHCO3-), resulting in an
oxygen isotope disequilibrium of the {\delta}18OHCO3- values with respect to
the {\delta}18O value of water ({\delta}18OH2O). The oxygen isotope
disequilibrium between HCO3- and H2O is re-equilibrated by oxygen isotope
exchange between H2O and HCO3. Depending on the temperature, the
re-equilibration time varies from hours to days and is usually much longer than
the residence time of the drip water on stalactites, but much shorter than the
time ...

this protocol two spatially separated parties can teleport an unknown quantum
state only by exploiting joint measurements on number of shared $d-$dimensional
maximally entangled states (resource state) together with a state to be
teleported and one way classical communication. In this paper we analyse for
the first time the recycling protocol for the deterministic PBT beyond the
qubit case. In the recycling protocol the main idea is to re-use the remaining
resource state after one or many rounds of PBT for further processes of
teleportation. The key property is to learn how much the underlying resource
state degrades after every round of the teleportation process. We measure this
by evaluating quantum fidelity between respective resource states. To do so we
first present analysis of the square-root measurements used by the sender in
PBT by exploiting the symmetries of the system. In particular, we show how to
effectively evaluate their square-roots and composition. These findings allow
us to present the explicit formula for the recycling fidelity involving only
group-theoretic parameters describing irreducible representations in the
Schur-Weyl duality. For the first time, we also analyse the degradation of the
resource state for the optimal PBT scheme and show its degradation for all
$d\geq 2$. In the both versions, the qubit case is discussed separately

  Logic","A revised version",,,,"cs.LO cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work we analyse the parameterised complexity of propositional
inclusion (PINC) and independence logic (PIND). The problems of interest are
model checking (MC) and satisfiability (SAT). The complexity of these problems
is well understood in the classical (non-parameterised) setting. Mahmood and
Meier (FoIKS 2020) recently studied the parameterised complexity of
propositional dependence logic (PDL). As a continuation of their work, we
classify inclusion and independence logic and thereby come closer to completing
the picture with respect to the parametrised complexity for the three most
studied logics in the propositional team semantics setting. We present results
for each problem with respect to 8 different parameterisations. It turns out
that for a team-based logic L such that L-atoms can be evaluated in polynomial
time, then MC parameterised by teamsize is FPT. As a corollary, we get an FPT
membership under the following parameterisations: formula-size, formula-depth,
treewidth, and number of variables. The parameter teamsize shows interesting
behavior for SAT. For PINC, the parameter teamsize is not meaningful, whereas
for PDL and PIND the satisfiability is paraNP-complete. Finally, we prove that
when parameterised by arity, both MC and SAT are paraNP-complete for each of
the considered logics.

statistically identify the cadence-formal error pattern knowing AGN time-lags
and periodicity from different surveys. We defined the simple metric for the
SF's properties, accounting for the 'observed' SF's deviation relative to those
obtained from the homogenously-sampled light curves. We tested the regression
models on different observing strategies: the optical dataset of long
light-curves of eight AGN with peculiarities and the artificial datasets based
on several idealized and LSST-like cadences. The SFs metric is assessed on
synthetic datasets. The regression models (for both data types) predict similar
cadences for time-lags and oscillation detection, whereas for light curves with
low variability ($\sim 10\%$), cadences for oscillation detection differ. For
higher variability ($\sim20\%$), predicted cadences are larger than for
$F_{var}\sim 10\%$. The predicted cadences are decreasing with redshift. SFs
with dense and homogenous cadences are more likely to behave similarly. SFs
with oscillatory signals are sensitive to the cadences, possibly impacting
LSST-like operation strategy.

paper, we apply the principles of Pareto-efficiency and least-difference to the
utility being accuracy, as an illustrative example, and arrive at the Rawls
classifier that minimizes the error rate on the worst-off sensitive
sub-population. Our mathematical characterization shows that the Rawls
classifier uniformly applies a threshold to an ideal score of features, in the
spirit of fair equality of opportunity. In practice, such a score or a feature
representation is often computed by a black-box model that has been useful but
unfair. Our second contribution is practical Rawlsian fair adaptation of any

a threshold classifier on the given score or a linear threshold classifier on

and specifically cmc $1/2$ surfaces in the three-manifold
$\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$. The value $1/2$ is the critical mean curvature
for $\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$, in that there do no exist closed cmc
surfaces with mean curvature $1/2$ or less. Daniel and Hauswirth have
constructed a one-parameter family of complete, cmc $1/2$ annuli that are
symmetric about a reflection in the horizontal plane $\mathbb{H}^2 \times
\{0\}$, the horizontal catenoids. In this thesis we prove that these catenoids
converge to a singular limit of two tangent horocylinders as the neck size
tends to zero. We discuss the analytic gluing construction that this fact
suggests, which would create a multitude of cmc $1/2$ surfaces with positive
genus.
  The main result of the thesis concerns a key step in such an analytic gluing
construction. We construct families of cmc $1/2$ annuli with boundary, whose
single end is asymptotic to an end of a horizontal catenoid. We produce these
families by solving the mean curvature equation for normal graphs off the end
of a horizontal catenoid. This is a non-linear boundary value problem, which we
solve by perturbative methods. To do so we analyse the linearised mean
curvature operator, known as the Jacobi operator. We show that on carefully
chosen weighted H\""older spaces the Jacobi operator can be inverted, modulo a
finite-dimensional subspace, and provided the neck size of the horizontal
catenoid is sufficiently small. Using these linear results we solve the
boundary value problem for the mean curvature equation by a contraction mapping
argument.

Electromagnetic (EM) counterparts are generally not expected for BBH merger

can possibly arise in special environments, prompting motivation to search for
EM counterparts for such events. We observed high-credibility regions of the
sky for the three BBH merger events with telescopes of the Gravitational-wave
EM Counterpart Korean Observatory (GECKO), including the KMTNet. Our
observation started as soon as 100 minutes after the GW event alerts and
covered 29 - 63 deg$^2$ for each event with a depth of $\sim$ 22.5 mag in
$R$-band within hours of observation. No plausible EM counterparts were found

signal to be $M_{g}$ > -18.0 AB mag within about 1 day of the GW event. The

this class of materials highly important for the field of condensed matter
physics. However, the structural origin of the superconducting state remained
elusive, despite being investigated intensively in recent years. We use
scanning tunneling microscopy and the normal incidence x-ray standing wave
(NIXSW) technique in order to determine the vertical position of the dopants --
one of the key parameters for understanding topological superconductivity in
this material -- for the case of Sr$_{x}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$. In a novel approach we
analyze the NIXSW data in consideration of the inelastic mean free path of the
photoemitted electrons, which allows us to distinguish between symmetry
equivalent sites. We find that Sr-atoms are not situated inside the van der
Waals gap between the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ quintuple layers but rather in the quintuple
layer close to the outer Se planes.

tests, for short) drawn from an item bank. The goal of fixed-from test assembly
is to generate a large number of different tests with information functions
that meet a target information function. Thus, every test has the same ability
estimation error. This work proposes a new way of test assembly, namely,
drawing tests with information functions that exceed the target. This
guarantees that every test has an ability estimation error that is less than
the error set by the target. The work estimates the number of target exceeding
tests as a function of the number of items in the test. It demonstrates that
the number of target exceeding tests is far greater than the number of target
meeting tests. A Monte Carlo importance sampling algorithm is proposed for
target exceeding test assembly.

is very rarely observed, but it is essential for stellar evolution. Since we
only know about twenty stars of this type, the study of each new object is very
important for our knowledge. Our data was obtained in the optical spectral
region with BVRI Johnson-Cousins set of filters during the period from
September 2011 to April 2021. In order to follow the photometric history of the
object, we measured its stellar magnitudes on the available plates from the
Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes. The collected archival data suggests
that the rise in brightness of V900 Mon began after January 1989 and the
outburst goes so far. In November 2009, when the outburst was registered, the
star had already reached a level of brightness close to the current one. Our
observations indicate that during the period 2011-2017 the stellar magnitude
increased gradually in each pass band. The observed amplitude of the outburst
is about 4 magnitudes (R). During the last three years, the increase in
brightness has stopped and there has even been a slight decline. The comparison
of the light curves of the known FUor objects shows that they are very diverse
and are rarely repeated. However, the photometric data we have so far shows
that the V900 Mon's light curve is somewhat similar to this of V1515 Cyg and
V733 Cep.

single-network PINN architecture for the given problem. Furthermore, the
single-network variant struggled to ensure species mass conservation in
different areas of the computational domain, whereas, the segregated approach
successfully maintained species conservation. The PINN predicted velocity,
temperature and species profiles for a given set of boundary conditions were
compared to results generated using OpenFOAM software. Both the single- and
segregated-network PINN models produced accurate results for temperature and
velocity profiles, with average percentage difference relative to the CFD
results of approximately 7.5% for velocity and 8% for temperature. The mean
error percentages for the species mass fractions are 9\% for the single-network

applicability of PINNs for surrogate modelling of multi-species problems, a
parameterised version of the segregated-network PINN is trained which could
produce results for different water vapour inlet velocities. The normalised

the modulation of the coupling strength, while the other physical parameters
remain unchanged. The composite pulses sequence is designed by vanishing
high-order error terms, and can compensate the systematic errors to any desired

disturbance of waveform deformations. This trait ensures that population
inversion can be nearly obtained even when the pulse sequence has a short jump

  overlap with arXiv:2105.13072",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computer-aided translation (CAT), the use of software to assist a human
translator in the translation process, has been proven to be useful in
enhancing the productivity of human translators. Autocompletion, which suggests
translation results according to the text pieces provided by human translators,
is a core function of CAT. There are two limitations in previous research in
this line. First, most research works on this topic focus on sentence-level
autocompletion (i.e., generating the whole translation as a sentence based on
human input), but word-level autocompletion is under-explored so far. Second,
almost no public benchmarks are available for the autocompletion task of CAT.
This might be among the reasons why research progress in CAT is much slower
compared to automatic MT. In this paper, we propose the task of general
word-level autocompletion (GWLAN) from a real-world CAT scenario, and construct
the first public benchmark to facilitate research in this topic. In addition,
we propose an effective method for GWLAN and compare it with several strong
baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can give
significantly more accurate predictions than the baseline methods on our

As the number of IoT applications increases, these objects are becoming more

response to the uncertainties of their environment to achieve their goals. In
Human-centered IoT, objects and devices have direct interactions with human
beings and have access to online contextual information. Self-adaptation of
such applications is a crucial subject that needs to be addressed in a way that
respects human goals and human values. Hence, IoT applications must be equipped
with self-adaptation techniques to manage their run-time uncertainties locally
or in cooperation with each other. This paper presents SMASH: a multi-agent
approach for self-adaptation of IoT applications in human-centered
environments. In this paper, we have considered the Smart Home as the case

architecture based on the BDI agent model that integrates human values with
goal-reasoning, planning, and acting. It also takes advantage of a
semantic-enabled platform called Home'In to address interoperability issues
among non-identical agents and devices with heterogeneous protocols and data
formats. This approach is compared with the literature and is validated by
developing a scenario as the proof of concept. The timely responses of SMASH
agents show the feasibility of the proposed approach in human-centered
environments.

operation of electric power grids. Their strategic placement is of ultimate
importance because it is not economically viable to install measurement systems
on every node and branch of a power grid, though they need to be monitored. An
overwhelming number of strategies have been developed to meet oftentimes
multiple conflicting objectives. The prime challenge in formulating the problem
lies in developing a heuristic or an optimization model that, though
mathematically tractable and constrained in cost, leads to trustworthy
technical solutions. Further, large-scale, long-term deployments pose
additional challenges because the boundary conditions change as technologies
evolve. For instance, the advent of new technologies in sensing and
measurement, as well as in communications and networking, might impact the cost
and performance of available solutions and shift initially set conditions.
Also, the placement strategies developed for transmission grids might not be
suitable for distribution grids, and vice versa, because of unique
characteristics; therefore, the strategies need to be flexible, to a certain
extent, because no two power grids are alike. Despite the extensive literature
on the present topic, the focus of published works tends to be on a specific
subject, such as the optimal placement of measurements to ensure observability
in transmission grids. There is a dearth of work providing a comprehensive
picture for developing optimal placement strategies. Because of the ongoing
efforts on the modernization of electric power grids, there is a need to
consolidate the status quo while exposing its limitations to inform
policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers on the
research-and-development needs to push the boundaries for innovation.

because of the symmetry representation (SR) of the flat band under unitary
symmetry. We refer to such a band degeneracy point of flat bands as a
SR-enforced band crossing. SR-enforced band crossing is distinct from the
conventional band degeneracy protected by symmetry eigenvalues or topological
charges in that its protection requires both specific symmetry representation
and band flatness of the flat band, simultaneously. Even $n$-fold rotation
$C_n$ ($n=2,3,4,6$) symmetry, which cannot protect band degeneracy without
additional symmetries due to its abelian nature, can protect SR-enforced band
crossings in flat band systems. In two-dimensional flat band systems with $C_n$
symmetry, when the degeneracy of a SR-enforced band crossing is lifted by a
$C_n$ symmetry-preserving perturbation, we obtain a nearly flat Chern band. Our
theory not only explains the origin of the band crossing points of FBs existing

sentences; b) the correlation among events in a document is non-trivial to
model. In this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Graph-based Interaction Model
with a Tracker (GIT) to solve the aforementioned two challenges. For the first
challenge, GIT constructs a heterogeneous graph interaction network to capture
global interactions among different sentences and entity mentions. For the
second, GIT introduces a Tracker module to track the extracted events and hence
capture the interdependency among the events. Experiments on a large-scale
dataset (Zheng et al., 2019) show GIT outperforms the previous methods by 2.8
F1. Further analysis reveals GIT is effective in extracting multiple correlated
events and event arguments that scatter across the document. Our code is

an appealing feature for many applications, including sensing and hybrid
integration of active materials. In most cases, strip waveguides are the
preferred solution to maximize the light interaction with the waveguide
surroundings. However, the only two degrees of freedom in Si strip waveguides
are the width and thickness, resulting in limited flexibility in evanescent
field control. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new strategy that exploits
metamaterial engineering of the waveguide core and cladding to control the
index contrast in the vertical and horizontal directions, independently. The
proposed dual-material geometry yields a substantially increased calculated
overlap with the air (0.35) compared to the best-case scenario for a strip
waveguide (0.3). To experimentally demonstrate the potential of this approach,
we have implemented dual-metamaterial ring resonators, operating with the
transverse-magnetic polarized mode in 220-nm-thick waveguides with air as
upper-cladding. Micro-ring resonators implemented with strip and
dual-metamaterial waveguides exhibit the same measured quality factors, near
30,000. Having similar measured quality factors and better calculated external
confinement factors than strip waveguides, the proposed dual-metamaterial

characteristics and are dedicated to exploring time series predictions, but
ignoring the spatial relationship between hosts. This paper combines the
temporal and spatial characteristics of security events and proposes a
spatial-temporal event prediction model, named STEP. In particular, STEP
formulates the security events prediction into a spatial-temporal sequence

Covid-19 crisis, where companies are even more challenged to offer their
services online, targeting a very high level of responsiveness in the face of
rapidly increasing and diverse demands. For this, microservices remain the most
suitable delivery application architectural style. They allow agility not only
on the technical application, as often considered, but on the enterprise
architecture as a whole, influencing the actual financial business of the
company. However, microservices adoption is highly risk-prone and complex.
Before they establish an appropriate migration plan, first and foremost,
companies must assess their degree of readiness to adopt microservices. For
this, MiMMo, a Microservices Maturity Model framework assessment, is proposed
to help companies assess their readiness for the microservice architectural
style, based on their actual situation. MiMMo results from observations of and
experience with about thirty organizations writing software. It conceptualizes
and generalizes the progression paths they have followed to adopt microservices
appropriately. Using the model, an organization can evaluate itself in two
dimensions and five maturity levels and thus: (i) benchmark itself on its
current use of microservices; (ii) project the next steps it needs to achieve a
higher maturity level and (iii) analyze how it has evolved and maintain a

ranging from biochemical sensors to mobile communications, quantum computing,
inertial sensing, and precision navigation. The quality factor of the
mechanical resonance is critical for many applications. Until recently,
mechanical quality factors rarely exceeded a million. In the past few years
however, new methods have been developed to exceed this boundary. These methods
involve careful engineering of the structure of the nanomechanical resonator,
including the use of acoustic bandgaps and nested structures to suppress
dissipation into the substrate, and the use of dissipation dilution and strain
engineering to increase the mechanical frequency and suppress intrinsic
dissipation. Together, they have allowed quality factors to reach values near a
billion at room temperature, resulting in exceptionally low dissipation. This
review aims to provide a pedagogical introduction to these new methods,
primarily targeted to readers who are new to the field, together with an
overview of the existing state-of-the-art, what may be possible in the future,
and a perspective on the future applications of these extreme-high quality

NODE-based discriminator performs a hidden vector evolution trajectory-based
classification rather than classifying with a hidden vector at the last layer
only. Our generator also adopts an ODE layer at the very beginning of its
architecture to transform its initial input vector (i.e., the concatenation of
a noisy vector and a condition vector in our case) onto another latent vector

infrared system. Therefore, many infrared small target detection methods have
been proposed, in which the low-rank model has been used as a powerful tool.
However, most low-rank-based methods assign the same weights for different
singular values, which will lead to inaccurate background estimation.
Considering that different singular values have different importance and should
be treated discriminatively, in this paper, we propose a non-convex tensor

different smoothness intensities for spatial and temporal regularization. We
design an efficient algorithm to find the optimal solution of our method.

which requires recommending to new users (items) based on attributes without
any historical interaction records. In these recommendation systems, warm users
(items) have privileged collaborative signals of interaction records compared
to cold start users (items), and these Collaborative Filtering (CF) signals are
shown to have competing performance for recommendation. Many researchers
proposed to learn the correlation between collaborative signal embedding space
and the attribute embedding space to improve the cold start recommendation, in
which user and item categorical attributes are available in many online
platforms. However, the cold start recommendation is still limited by two
embedding spaces modeling and simple assumptions of space transformation. As
user-item interaction behaviors and user (item) attributes naturally form a
heterogeneous graph structure, in this paper, we propose a privileged graph
distillation model~(PGD). The teacher model is composed of a heterogeneous
graph structure for warm users and items with privileged CF links. The student
model is composed of an entity-attribute graph without CF links. Specifically,
the teacher model can learn better embeddings of each entity by injecting
complex higher-order relationships from the constructed heterogeneous graph.
The student model can learn the distilled output with privileged CF embeddings
from the teacher embeddings. Our proposed model is generally applicable to
different cold start scenarios with new user, new item, or new user-new item.
Finally, extensive experimental results on the real-world datasets clearly show
the effectiveness of our proposed model on different types of cold start

solar system dates back to more than thirty years ago, the secular chaos of
their orbits still dares more analytical analyses. Apart from the
high-dimensional structure of the motion, this is probably related to the lack
of an adequately simple dynamical model. Here, we consider a new secular
dynamics for the inner planets, with the aim of retaining a fundamental set of
interactions responsible for their chaotic behaviour, while being consistent
with the predictions of the most precise orbital solutions currently available.
We exploit the regularity in the secular motion of the outer planets, to
predetermine a quasi-periodic solution for their orbits. This reduces the
secular phase space to the degrees of freedom dominated by the inner planets.
On top of that, the smallness of the inner planet masses and the absence of
strong mean-motion resonances permits to restrict ourselves to first-order
secular averaging. The resulting dynamics can be integrated numerically in a
very efficient way through Gauss's method, while computer algebra allows for
analytical inspection of planet interactions, once the Hamiltonian is truncated
at a given total degree in eccentricities and inclinations. The new model
matches very satisfactorily reference orbital solutions of the solar system
over timescales shorter than or comparable to the Lyapunov time. It correctly
reproduces the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the inner system and the statistics
of the high eccentricities of Mercury over the next five billion years. The
destabilizing role of the $g_1-g_5$ secular resonance also arises. A numerical
experiment, consisting of a thousand orbital solutions over one hundred billion
years, reveals the essential properties of the stochastic process driving the
destabilization of the inner solar system and clarifies its current metastable

identification of disease, structure, and function of the brain in its healthy
and disease states. Literature shows that there are advantages of multitasking
with some deep learning (DL) schemes in challenging neuroimaging applications.
This study examines the feasibility of using multitasking in three different
applications, including tissue segmentation, cross-modality conversion, and
bias-field correction. These applications reflect five different scenarios in
which multitasking is explored and 280 training and testing sessions conducted
for empirical evaluations. Two well-known networks, U-Net as a well-known
convolutional neural network architecture, and a closed architecture based on
the conditional generative adversarial network are implemented. Different
metrics such as the normalized cross-correlation coefficient and Dice scores
are used for comparison of methods and results of the different experiments.
Statistical analysis is also provided by paired t-test. The present study
explores the pros and cons of these methods and their practical impacts on
multitasking in different implementation scenarios. This investigation shows
that bias correction and cross-modality conversion applications are
significantly easier than the segmentation application, and having multitasking
with segmentation is not reasonable if one of them is identified as the main
target application. However, when the main application is the segmentation of

importance of a quantity called diversity when generalizing from a set of

mapping shared representations to predictions is linear, for both source and
target tasks. In practice, researchers in deep learning use different numbers
of extra layers following the pretrained model based on the difficulty of the
new task. This motivates us to ask whether diversity can be achieved when
source tasks and the target task use different prediction function spaces
beyond linear functions. We show that diversity holds even if the target task
uses a neural network with multiple layers, as long as source tasks use linear
functions. If source tasks use nonlinear prediction functions, we provide a
negative result by showing that depth-1 neural networks with ReLu activation
function need exponentially many source tasks to achieve diversity. For a
general function class, we find that eluder dimension gives a lower bound on
the number of tasks required for diversity. Our theoretical results imply that
simpler tasks generalize better. Though our theoretical results are shown for

hold true for gradient-based optimization algorithms as verified by our

turning maneuvers. UTS then tracks the vehicles using a 3D bounding box
representation and a physically reasonable 3D motion model relying on an
unscented Kalman filter based approach. Since UTS recovers positions, shape and
motion information in a three-dimensional world coordinate system, it can be
employed to recognize diverse traffic violations or to supply intelligent
vehicles with valuable traffic information. We build on YOLOv3 as a detector
yielding 2D bounding boxes and class labels for each vehicle. A 2D detector
renders our system much more independent to different camera perspectives as a
variety of labeled training data is available. This allows for a good
generalization while also being more hardware efficient. The task of 3D
tracking based on 2D detections is supported by integrating class specific
prior knowledge about the vehicle shape. We quantitatively evaluate UTS using
self generated synthetic data and ground truth from the CARLA simulator, due to
the non-existence of datasets with an urban vehicle surveillance setting and
labeled 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, we give a qualitative impression of
how UTS performs on real-world data. Our implementation is capable of operating
in real time on a reasonably modern workstation. To the best of our knowledge,
UTS is to date the only 3D vehicle tracking system in a surveillance scenario

for increasing agricultural production among family farms, such as the National
Program for Strengthening Family Farming (Pronaf), the technical assistance and
rural extension programmes (ATER), and seeds distribution. Despite the
importance of these policies for the development of family farming, there is a
lack of empirical studies investigating their impact on commercialization of
food products. By considering household-level data from the 2014 Brazilian
National Household Sample Survey, we use propensity score matching techniques
accounting for the interaction effects between policies to compare the
commercialisation behaviour of recipients with non recipients. We find that
Pronaf has a significant positive impact on family farmers propensity to engage
in commercialisation, and this effect increases if farmers have also access to
ATER. Receiving technical assistance alone has a positive effect, but this is
mostly limited to smaller farms. In turn, seed distribution appears not to
increase commercialization significantly. A well balanced policy mix could
ensure that, in a country subject to the pressure of international food
markets, increased commercialisation does not result in reduced food security
for rural dwellers.

choice of action. Motivated by the significant social inefficiency of standard
contracts for such settings (which we formally quantify using a price of
anarchy/stability analysis), we investigate whether and how a recent toolbox

inherent tradeoff between two important properties required to ensure

limited liability (for the agent). We design a polynomial-time algorithm for
determining whether a setting has an IIVCG contract with both properties. As
our main result we design a polynomial-time ""algorithmic IIVCG"" contract: given
valuation reports from the principals it returns, if possible for the setting,
a payment scheme for the agent that constitutes an IIVCG contract with all
desired properties. We also give a sufficient graph-theoretic condition on the
population of principals that ensures the existence of such an IIVCG contract.

appropriate boundary conditions, i.e., slip velocity at the body surface and
the ambient velocity field at the far-field, we calculate the migration

compare the velocity with some previously known results in appropriate limits.
The continuous unsteady motion of the swimmer affects its tactic movement. A
relevant example of this situation is chemotaxis, where the presence of
chemical stimulus alters the swimmer's surface slip velocity. As a result, the
swimmer either steers towards the chemical target or moves away from it,
depending on the system parameters. Here, the rotation rate controls the
success of the chemotaxis. In addition to the successful and unsuccessful
cases, we observe a unique orbiting state where the swimmer keeps revolving

  Approximation and Near-Optimal Additive Error","61 pages",,,,"cs.DS cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Given a data set of size $n$ in $d'$-dimensional Euclidean space, the
$k$-means problem asks for a set of $k$ points (called centers) so that the sum
of the $\ell_2^2$-distances between points of a given data set of size $n$ and
the set of $k$ centers is minimized. Recent work on this problem in the locally
private setting achieves constant multiplicative approximation with additive
error $\tilde{O} (n^{1/2 + a} \cdot k \cdot \max \{\sqrt{d}, \sqrt{k} \})$ and
proves a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ on the additive error for any
solution with a constant number of rounds. In this work we bridge the gap
between the exponents of $n$ in the upper and lower bounds on the additive
error with two new algorithms. Given any $\alpha>0$, our first algorithm
achieves a multiplicative approximation guarantee which is at most a
$(1+\alpha)$ factor greater than that of any non-private $k$-means clustering
algorithm with $k^{\tilde{O}(1/\alpha^2)} \sqrt{d' n} \mbox{poly}\log n$
additive error. Given any $c>\sqrt{2}$, our second algorithm achieves $O(k^{1 +
\tilde{O}(1/(2c^2-1))} \sqrt{d' n} \mbox{poly} \log n)$ additive error with
constant multiplicative approximation. Both algorithms go beyond the
$\Omega(n^{1/2 + a})$ factor that occurs in the additive error for arbitrarily
small parameters $a$ in previous work, and the second algorithm in particular
shows for the first time that it is possible to solve the locally private
$k$-means problem in a constant number of rounds with constant factor
multiplicative approximation and polynomial dependence on $k$ in the additive
error arbitrarily close to linear.

  the Newtonian $n$-body problem","30 Pages, comments welcome",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the Newtonian (gravitational) $n$-body problem in the Euclidean
$d$-dimensional space, $d\ge 2$, the simplest possible periodic solutions are
provided by circular relative equilibria, (RE) for short, namely solutions in
which each body rigidly rotates about the center of mass and the configuration
of the whole system is constant in time and central (or, more generally,
balanced) configuration. For $d\le 3$, the only possible (RE) are planar, but
in dimension four it is possible to get truly four dimensional (RE).
  A classical problem in celestial mechanics aims at relating the
(in-)stability properties of a (RE) to the index properties of the central (or,
more generally, balanced) configuration generating it. In this paper, we
provide sufficient conditions that imply the spectral instability of planar and
non-planar (RE) in $\mathbb R^4$ generated by a central configuration, thus
answering some of the questions raised in \cite[Page 63]{Moe14}. As a
corollary, we retrieve a classical result of Hu and Sun \cite{HS09} on the
linear instability of planar (RE) whose generating central configuration is
non-degenerate and has odd Morse index, and fix a gap in the statement of
\cite[Theorem 1]{BJP14} about the spectral instability of planar (RE) whose
(possibly degenerate) generating central configuration has odd Morse index.
  The key ingredients are a new formula of independent interest that allows to
compute the spectral flow of a path of symmetric matrices having degenerate
starting point, and a symplectic decomposition of the phase space of the
linearized Hamiltonian system along a given (RE) which is inspired by Meyer and
Schmidt's planar decomposition \cite{MS05} and which allows us to rule out the
uninteresting part of the dynamics corresponding to the translational and
(partially) to the rotational symmetry of the problem.

gradients are similar to the victim's ones. However, it is generally neglected
to exploit their similarity on outputs, namely the Prediction Similarity (PS),
to filter out inefficient queries by surrogates without querying the victim. To
jointly utilize and also optimize surrogates' GS and PS, we develop QueryNet, a
unified attack framework that can significantly reduce queries. QueryNet
creatively attacks by multi-identity surrogates, i.e., crafts several AEs for
one sample by different surrogates, and also uses surrogates to decide on the
most promising AE for the query. After that, the victim's query feedback is
accumulated to optimize not only surrogates' parameters but also their

access to pre-trained surrogates' prior, it reduces queries by averagely about
an order of magnitude compared to alternatives within an acceptable time,

  The thesis offers a systematic study of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) on non-compact spaces. In particular we solve the open problem on strong
completeness. An SDE is strongly complete if its solution can be chosen to
depend continuously in space and in time for all time. The question is whether
non-explosion, with possibly additional assumptions, implies strong
completeness. Strong completeness of an SDE implies that its solution depends
continuously on the initial condition, opening up possibility for numerical
solutions, and the existence of a perfect Cocycle (a basic assumption on random
dynamical systems). This was known only for compact manifolds and for linear
state spaces, methods for either are not applicable to a general space. We also
obtain existence of the global smooth solution flow of SDEs on $R^n$ (sometimes
allowing substantial growth of the derivative of the coefficients, removing the
global Lipschitz continuity condition). Non-explosion, the $C_0$-property, and
the derivative flow are studied.
  We showed Bismut-Witten Laplacians are essentially self-adjojnt, paving the
way for studying theirs semigroups acting on functions and on differential
forms. We relate the Markovian semi-group on differential one forms with the

integration formulas for $dP_tf$, path integration formula for semi-group on

very young, solar-like star of 0.1 Gyr to a 5.0 Gyr star. For each star-planet
configuration, we show that the morphology of extended Earth-like hydrogen
exospheres is strongly dependent of the incident stellar winds and the produced
ions present in these gaseous envelopes, showing that the ionized component of
Earth-like exospheres is quickly swept by the stellar winds of young stars,
leading to large bow shock formation for later stellar ages.

devoted to compiling high-level quantum algorithms into lower-level circuits of

unitary transformation that describes the quantum computation, as a sequence of
elements selected from a finite base of universal quantum gates. The existence
of an approximating sequence of one qubit quantum gates is guaranteed by the
Solovay-Kitaev theorem, which implies sub-optimal algorithms to establish it
explicitly. Since a unitary transformation may require significantly different
gate sequences, depending on the base considered, such a problem is of great
complexity and does not admit an efficient approximating algorithm. Therefore,
traditional approaches are time-consuming tasks, unsuitable to be employed
during quantum computation. We exploit the deep reinforcement learning method
as an alternative strategy, which has a significantly different trade-off
between search time and exploitation time. Deep reinforcement learning allows
creating single-qubit operations in real time, after an arbitrary long training
period during which a strategy for creating sequences to approximate unitary
operators is built. The deep reinforcement learning based compiling method
allows for fast computation times, which could in principle be exploited for
real-time quantum compiling.

polynomials. The numbers $\mathcal{B}_{r,s}$ can be recursively expressed by
iterated sums and differences, so it is not obvious that these numbers do not
vanish in general. As a main result among other properties, we show the
non-vanishing of these numbers, apart from exceptional cases. We further derive
an explicit product formula for their denominators, which follows from a von
Staudt--Clausen type relation.

gauge field is created by simultaneous modulations of the optical lattice

by measuring the Fermi momenta (kF) from energy and angular distribution of

for a natural image, if we add the dominant pattern of a DNN to it, the output
of this DNN is determined by the dominant pattern instead of the original

design an algorithm to find such patterns by pursuing the insensitivity in the

Adversarial Perturbations(UAPs). Numerical experiments show that the found
dominant patterns defeat state-of-the-art UAP methods, especially in label-free

attack downstream tasks in which DNNs share the same backbone. We claim that
DNN-specific dominant patterns reveal some essential properties of a DNN and
are of great importance for its feature analysis and robustness enhancement.

Unfortunately, this problem is NP-hard, forcing relaxations that lose

solves the optimal fusion of estimates under unknown correlations by a

certify, locally and in real time, if the relaxed solution is the actual
optimum. In that case, we prove optimality in the Mean Square Error (MSE)

extensively observed to study the formation history of galaxies. However, the
origin of their extended Ly-alpha emission, especially of LABs, remains
controversial. Polarization signals from some LABs have been discovered, and
this is commonly interpreted as strong evidence supporting that the extended
Ly-alpha emission originates from the resonance scattering. The Monte Carlo
Ly-alpha radiative transfer code LaRT is updated to investigate the
polarization of Ly-alpha using the Stokes vector formalism. We apply LaRT to a
few models to explore the fundamental polarization properties of Ly-alpha.
Interestingly, individual Ly-alpha photon packets are found to be almost
completely polarized by a sufficient number of scatterings (N_scatt > 10^4-10^5
in a static medium) or Doppler shifts induced by gas motion, even starting from
unpolarized light. It is also found that the polarization pattern can exhibit a
non-monotonically increasing pattern in some cases, besides the commonly-known
trend that the polarization monotonically increases with radius. The
polarization properties are primarily determined by the degree of polarization
of individual photon packets and the anisotropy of the Ly-alpha radiation
field, which are eventually controlled by the medium's optical depth and
velocity field. If once Ly-alpha photon packets achieve ~100% polarization, the
radial profile of polarization appears to correlate with the surface brightness
profile. A steep surface brightness profile tends to yield a rapid increase of
the linear polarization near the Ly-alpha source location. In contrast, a
shallow surface brightness profile gives rise to a slowly increasing
polarization pattern.

determined to be 28 eV for Zr3a primary knock-on atom along [111] direction, 40
eV for Zr18f atoms along [111] direction and 50 eV for Y recoils along [110]

respectively. The displacement energies of anions are much smaller compared to
cations, thus suggesting that anion disorder is more probable than cation
disorder. All directions except the direction in which inherent structural
vacancies are aligned, cations tend to occupy another cation site. The
threshold displacement energies are larger than that of Y2Ti2O7, the
conventional precipitates in Ti containing ODS steels. Due to the partial
occupancy of Y and Zr in the 18f position, the antisite formation energy is
negligibly small, and it may help the structure to withstand more disorder upon

fits into the mission, and the importance of having a trained DNN model instead
of the usual GN&C functionality. This paper shows how the controller
demonstration is carried out by having the spacecraft follow a desired path,
specified in the referenced model. Increases can be made by examining the route
used to construct a DNN and understanding the effects of various activating
functions on system efficiency. The obstacle avoidance algorithm is built into
the control features to respond spontaneously using inputs from the neural
network for collision avoidance while optimizing the modified trajectory. The
action of a neural network to control the adaptive nature of the nonlinear
mechanisms in the controller will make the control system capable of handling
multiple nonlinear events and also uncertainties that have not been induced in
the control algorithm. Multiple algorithms for optimizing flight controls and
fuel consumption can be implemented using knowledge of flight dynamics in
trajectory and also in the event of obstacle avoidance. This paper also
explains how a DNN can learn to control the flight path and make the system
more reliable with each launch, thereby improving the chances of predicting
collisions of space objects. The data released from this research is used to
design more advanced DNN model capable of predicting other orbital events as
well.

considerable development in recent years. Several aspects of problems have been
resolved by sparse regression-based and neural network-based methods. However,
the performances of existing methods lack stability when dealing with complex
situations, including sparse data with high noise, high-order derivatives and
shock waves, which bring obstacles to calculating derivatives accurately.
Therefore, a robust PDE discovery framework, called the robust deep
learning-genetic algorithm (R-DLGA), that incorporates the physics-informed
neural network (PINN), is proposed in this work. In the framework, a
preliminary result of potential terms provided by the deep learning-genetic
algorithm is added into the loss function of the PINN as physical constraints
to improve the accuracy of derivative calculation. It assists to optimize the
preliminary result and obtain the ultimately discovered PDE by eliminating the
error compensation terms. The stability and accuracy of the proposed R-DLGA in
several complex situations are examined for proof-and-concept, and the results
prove that the proposed framework is able to calculate derivatives accurately
with the optimization of PINN and possesses surprising robustness to complex
situations, including sparse data with high noise, high-order derivatives, and

which validates the proposed framework. Unknown macroscopic equations are then
obtained for describing short-term behaviors, and additional deep-learned

shows that the deep-learning based PDEs actually perform better than the
theoretically derived PDEs in predicting evolving viscous gravity currents for
both long-term and short-term regimes. Moreover, the proposed framework is
proven to be very robust against non-biased data noise for training, which is
up to 20%. Consequently, the presented deep-learning framework shows
considerable potential for discovering unrevealed intrinsic laws in scientific

suppressing the echo received at microphone introduced by acoustic
reverberations from loudspeakers. Since the performance of linear adaptive

noises, and microphone clipping in real scenarios, deep learning has been
employed for AEC for its good nonlinear modelling ability. In this paper, we
constructed an end-to-end multi-scale attention neural network for AEC.
Temporal convolution is first used to transform waveform into spectrogram. The
spectrograms of the far-end reference and the near-end mixture are
concatenated, and fed to a temporal convolution network (TCN) with stacked
dilated convolution layers. Attention mechanism is performed among these
representations from different layers to adaptively extract relevant features
by referring to the previous hidden state in the encoder long short-term memory

are decomposed into virtualized components that can be hosted at the
centralized unit or distributed units through functional splits. Such
flexibility has many benefits; however, it also requires solving the problem of
finding the optimal splits of functions of the BSs in such a way that minimizes
the total network cost. The underlying vRAN system is complex and precise
modelling of it is not trivial. Formulating the functional split problem to
minimize the cost results in a combinatorial problem that is provably NP-hard,
and solving it is computationally expensive. In this paper, a constrained deep
reinforcement learning (RL) approach is proposed to solve the problem with
minimal assumptions about the underlying system. Since in deep RL, the action
selection is the outcome of inference of a neural network, it can be done in
real-time while training to update the neural networks can be done in the
background. However, since the problem is combinatorial, even for a small
number of functions, the action space of the RL problem becomes large.
Therefore, to deal with such a large action space, a chain rule-based
stochastic policy is exploited in which a long short-term memory (LSTM)
network-based sequence-to-sequence model is applied to estimate the policy that
is selecting the functional split actions. However, the utilized policy is
still limited to an unconstrained problem, and each split decision is bounded
by vRAN's constraint requirements. Hence, a constrained policy gradient method
is leveraged to train and guide the policy toward constraint satisfaction.
Further, a search strategy by greedy decoding or temperature sampling is
utilized to improve the optimality performance at the test time. Simulations
are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution using
synthetic and real network datasets.

can influence the time evolution of free particles in the nonrelativistic and
relativistic domains. For this goal, we consider a system of either two
distinguishable or indistinguishable (bosons and fermions) particles. Two
classes of initial conditions have been studied: different initial locations
with the same momenta, and the same locations with different momenta. The
flight time distribution of particles arriving at a `screen' is calculated in
each case. Fermions display broader distributions as compared with either
distinguishable particles or bosons, leading to earlier and later arrivals for
all the cases analyzed here. The symmetry of the wave function seems to speed
up or slow down propagation of particles. Due to the cross terms, certain
initial conditions lead to bimodality in the fermionic case. Within the
nonrelativistic domain and when the short-time survival probability is
analyzed, if the cross term becomes important, one finds that the decay of the
overlap of fermions is faster than for distinguishable particles which in turn
is faster than for bosons. These results are of interest in the short time
limit since they imply that the well-known quantum Zeno effect would be
stronger for bosons than for fermions.Fermions also arrive earlier than bosons
when they are scattered by a delta barrier. Furthermore, the particle symmetry
does not affect the mean tunneling flight time and it is given by the phase
time for the distinguishable particle.

gradient aggregation, and propose an energy-aware dynamic device scheduling
algorithm to optimize the training performance under energy constraints of
devices, where both communication energy for gradient aggregation and
computation energy for local training are included. The consideration of
computation energy makes dynamic scheduling challenging, as devices are
scheduled before local training, but the communication energy for over-the-air
aggregation depends on the l2-norm of local gradient, which is known after
local training. We thus incorporate estimation methods into scheduling to
predict the gradient norm. Taking the estimation error into account, we
characterize the performance gap between the proposed algorithm and its offline
counterpart. Experimental results show that, under a highly unbalanced local

aspect of the input data that an analyst thinks shouldn't matter. In machine
learning, these have a know-it-when-you-see-it character; e.g., changing the
gender of a sentence's subject changes a sentiment predictor's output. To check
for spurious correlations, we can 'stress test' models by perturbing irrelevant
parts of input data and seeing if model predictions change. In this paper, we
study stress testing using the tools of causal inference. We introduce
counterfactual invariance as a formalization of the requirement that changing
irrelevant parts of the input shouldn't change model predictions. We connect
counterfactual invariance to out-of-domain model performance, and provide
practical schemes for learning (approximately) counterfactual invariant
predictors (without access to counterfactual examples). It turns out that both
the means and implications of counterfactual invariance depend fundamentally on
the true underlying causal structure of the data -- in particular, whether the
label causes the features or the features cause the label. Distinct causal
structures require distinct regularization schemes to induce counterfactual
invariance. Similarly, counterfactual invariance implies different domain shift
guarantees depending on the underlying causal structure. This theory is
supported by empirical results on text classification.

role in ubiquitous computing. However, the rise of data regulatory constraints
precludes collecting private and labeled signal data from personal devices at
scale. Federated learning has emerged as a decentralized alternative solution
to model training, which iteratively aggregates locally updated models into a
shared global model, therefore being able to leverage decentralized, private
data without central collection. However, the effectiveness of federated
learning for HAR is affected by the fact that each user has different activity
types and even a different signal distribution for the same activity type.
Furthermore, it is uncertain if a single global model trained can generalize
well to individual users or new users with heterogeneous data. In this paper,
we propose Meta-HAR, a federated representation learning framework, in which a
signal embedding network is meta-learned in a federated manner, while the
learned signal representations are further fed into a personalized
classification network at each user for activity prediction. In order to boost
the representation ability of the embedding network, we treat the HAR problem
at each user as a different task and train the shared embedding network through
a Model-Agnostic Meta-learning framework, such that the embedding network can
generalize to any individual user. Personalization is further achieved on top
of the robustly learned representations in an adaptation procedure. We
conducted extensive experiments based on two publicly available HAR datasets as
well as a newly created HAR dataset. Results verify that Meta-HAR is effective
at maintaining high test accuracies for individual users, including new users,
and significantly outperforms several baselines, including Federated Averaging,
Reptile and even centralized learning in certain cases.

developing various effective optimizers. However, a prominent issue that all
these optimizers need to take care of is how to avoid the search being trapped
in local optima -- a hard nut to crack for software configuration tuning due to
its rugged and sparse landscape, and neighboring configurations tending to
behave very differently. Overcoming such in an expensive measurement setting is
even more challenging. In this paper, we take a different perspective to tackle
this issue. Instead of focusing on improving the optimizer, we work on the
level of optimization model. We do this by proposing a meta

objective (e.g., throughput in addition to latency). What makes this model
unique is that we do not optimize the auxiliary performance objective, but
rather use it to make similarly-performing while different configurations less
comparable (i.e. Pareto nondominated to each other), thus preventing the search
from being trapped in local optima.
  Experiments on eight real-world software systems/environments with diverse
performance attributes reveal that our MMO model is statistically more

Bilson-Thompson, the leptons and quarks of a single generation, together with
the electroweak gauge bosons, are represented as elements of the framed braid
group of three ribbons. By identifying these braids with emergent topological
excitations of ribbon networks, it has been possible to encode this braid model
into the framework of quantum geometry provided by loop quantum gravity. In the
case of trivalent networks, it has not been possible to generate particle
interactions, because the braids correspond to noiseless subsystems, meaning
they commute with the evolution algebra generated by the local Pachner moves.
In the case of tetravalent networks, interactions are only possible when the
model's original simplicity, in which interactions take place via the
composition of braids, is sacrificed. We demonstrate that it possible to
preserve both the original classification of fermions, as well as their
interaction via the braid product, if we embed the braid in a trivalent scheme,
and supplement the local Pachner moves, with a non-local and graph changing
1-handle attachment. Moreover, we use Kauffman-Lins recoupling theory to obtain
invariants of braided networks that distinguish topological configurations
associated to particles in the Bilson-Thompson model.

  two-phase flow in a unified low-Mach framework",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a comparison of four popular interface capturing methods
: the volume of fluid (VOF), the standard level set (SLS), the accurate
conservative level set (ACLS) and the coupled level set and volume of fluid
(CLSVOF). All methods are embedded into a unified low-Mach framework based on a
Cartesian-grid finite-volume discretization. This framework includes a sharp
transport of the interface, a wellbalanced surface tension discretization and a
consistent mass and momentum transport which allows capillary-driven
simulations with high density ratio. The comparison relies on shared metrics
for geometrical accuracy, mass and momentum conservation which exposes the
weakness and strengths of each method. Finally, the versatility and
capabilities of the proposed solver are demonstrated on the simulation of a 3D
head-on collision of two water droplets. Overall, all methods manage to
retrieve reasonable results for all test cases presented. VOF, CLSVOF and ACLS
tend to artificially create little structures while SLS suffers from
conservation issues in the mesh resolution limit. This study leads us to the
conclusion that CLSVOF is the most promising method for two-phase flow
simulations in our specific framework because of its inherent conservation
properties and topology accuracy.

adapted to work with spatial data. We consider the Ordinal Graph-based

OGO-SP is proposed, the OGO-SP-$\beta$ algorithm, which applies the beta

better suited distribution when compared to gamma. The evaluation of the
different methods is based on a novel 3D image dataset provided by the Hospital

automatic classification of smart contracts can provide blockchain users with
keyword-based contract searching and helps to manage smart contracts
effectively. Current research on smart contract classification focuses on
Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source
code. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the
application scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models
are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification
model based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve
these problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize
the model. Our experimental studies on over 3,300 real-world Ethereum smart
contracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code
and has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good
resistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models. In addition,
our analysis reveals that account features used in many smart contract
classification models have little effect on classification and can be excluded.

indoor positioning using radio frequency (RF) channel state information (CSI).
WiCluster can predict both a zone-level position and a precise 2D or 3D
position, without using any precise position labels during training. Prior
CSI-based indoor positioning work has relied on non-parametric approaches using
digital signal-processing (DSP) and, more recently, parametric approaches
(e.g., fully supervised ML methods). However these do not handle the complexity
of real-world environments well and do not meet requirements for large-scale
commercial deployments: the accuracy of DSP-based method deteriorates
significantly in non-line-of-sight conditions, while supervised ML methods need
large amounts of hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. In
contrast, WiCluster is precise, requires weaker label-information that can be
easily collected, and works well in non-line-of-sight conditions. Our first
contribution is a novel dimensionality reduction method for charting. It
combines a triplet-loss with a multi-scale clustering-loss to map the
high-dimensional CSI representation to a 2D/3D latent space. Our second
contribution is two weakly supervised losses that map this latent space into a
Cartesian map, resulting in meter-accuracy position results. These losses only
require simple to acquire priors: a sketch of the floorplan, approximate
access-point locations and a few CSI packets that are labelled with the
corresponding zone in the floorplan. Thirdly, we report results and a
robustness study for 2D positioning in two single-floor office buildings and 3D
