purely data-driven and in general does not require physics. This is the
strength of DL but also one of its key limitations when applied to science and
engineering problems in which underlying physical properties and desired
accuracy need to be achieved. DL methods in their original forms are not
capable of respecting the underlying mathematical models or achieving desired
accuracy even in big-data regimes. However, many data-driven science and
engineering problems, such as inverse problems, typically have limited
experimental or observational data, and DL would overfit the data in this case.
Leveraging information encoded in the underlying mathematical models, we argue,
not only compensates missing information in low data regimes but also provides
opportunities to equip DL methods with the underlying physics, hence promoting
better generalization. This paper develops a model-constrained deep learning
approach and its variant TNet that are capable of learning information hidden
in both the training data and the underlying mathematical models to solve
inverse problems governed by partial differential equations. We provide the
constructions and some theoretical results for the proposed approaches. We show
that data randomization can enhance the smoothness of the networks and their
generalizations. Comprehensive numerical results not only confirm the
theoretical findings but also show that with even as little as 20 training data
samples for 1D deconvolution, 50 for inverse 2D heat conductivity problem, 100
and 50 for inverse initial conditions for time-dependent 2D Burgers' equation
and 2D Navier-Stokes equations, respectively. TNet solutions can be as accurate
as Tikhonov solutions while being several orders of magnitude faster. This is
possible owing to the model-constrained term, replications, and randomization.

processes in order to mitigate the fact that they are often observed discretely
and noisily, occasionally irregularly and sparsely. The smoothness assumption
is imposed to allow for the use of smoothing techniques that annihilate the
noise. At the same time, imposing the smoothness assumption excludes a
considerable range of stochastic processes, most notably diffusion processes.
Under perfect observation of the sample paths, such processes would not need to
be excluded from the realm of functional data analysis. In this paper, we
introduce a careful modification of existing methods, dubbed the ""reflected
triangle estimator"", and show that this allows for the functional data analysis
of processes with nowhere differentiable sample paths, even when these are
discretely and noisily observed, including under irregular and sparse designs.
Our estimator matches the established rates of convergence for processes with
smooth paths, and furthermore attains the same optimal rates as one would get
under perfect observation. Thus, with reflected triangle estimation, the scope
of applicability of much of the methodology developed for
discretely/irregularly/noisily/sparsely sampled functional data is considerably
extended. By way of simulation it is shown that the advantages furnished are
reflected in practice, hinting at potential closer links with the field of

resolution; these maps need to be enhanced to be used in many applications.
State-of-the-art data-driven methods of depth map super-resolution rely on
registered pairs of low- and high-resolution depth maps of the same scenes.
Acquisition of real-world paired data requires specialized setups. Another
alternative, generating low-resolution maps from high-resolution maps by
subsampling, adding noise and other artificial degradation methods, does not
fully capture the characteristics of real-world low-resolution images. As a
consequence, supervised learning methods trained on such artificial paired data
may not perform well on real-world low-resolution inputs. We consider an
approach to depth super-resolution based on learning from unpaired data. While
many techniques for unpaired image-to-image translation have been proposed,
most fail to deliver effective hole-filling or reconstruct accurate surfaces
using depth maps. We propose an unpaired learning method for depth
super-resolution, which is based on a learnable degradation model, enhancement
component and surface normal estimates as features to produce more accurate
depth maps. We propose a benchmark for unpaired depth SR and demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing unpaired methods and performs on par with
paired.

missions like CHEOPS aim to characterize previously detected exoplanets, and
potentially to discover exomoons. In order to optimize search strategies, we
need to determine those planets which are the most likely to host moons. We
investigate the tidal evolution of hypothetical moon orbits in systems
consisting of a star, one planet and one test moon. We study a few specific
cases with ten billion years integration time where the evolution of moon
orbits follows one of these three scenarios: (1) ""locking"", in which the moon
has a stable orbit on a long time scale ($\gtrsim$ 10$^9$ years); (2) ""escape
scenario"" where the moon leaves the planet's gravitational domain; and (3)
""disruption scenario"", in which the moon migrates inwards until it reaches the
Roche lobe and becomes disrupted by strong tidal forces. Applying the model to
real cases from an exoplanet catalogue, we study the long-term stability of
moon orbits around known exoplanets. We calculate the survival rate which is
the fraction of the investigated cases when the moon survived around the planet
for the full integration time (which is the age of the star, or if not known,
then the age of the Sun).The most important factor determining the long term
survival of an exomoon is the orbital period of the planet. For the majority of
the close-in planets (<10 days orbital periods) there is no stable orbit for
moons. Between 10 and 300 days we find a transition in survival rate from about
zero to 70\%. Our results give a possible explanation to the lack of successful
exomoon discoveries for close-in planets. Tidal instability causes moons to
escape or being tidally disrupted around close-in planets which are mostly
favoured by current detection techniques.

both related to the need to expose individuals to potentially harmful
compounds. Computational modeling is a complementary useful and predictive tool
that overcomes these limitations. Considering the increasing interest in the
effects of pesticides on behavioral traits, the aim of this study was to
evaluate the effects of chlorpyrifos (CPF) on intra- and inter-specific
interactions of anuran tadpoles, complementing traditional ecotoxicological
tools with a theoretical analysis verified by computational simulations.
Experiments were developed under two consecutive phases: a first phase of
exposure, and a second phase of interactions. The second phase consisted of
evaluating the effects of CPF on intra- and inter-specific interactions of
exposed C. ornata (Co) tadpoles acting as predators and unexposed Rhinella
fernandezae (Rf) tadpoles acting as prey, under different predator-prey
proportions. Also, intraspecific interactions of three Co tadpoles under
different conditions of exposure were evaluated. During the exposure phase,
chlorpyrifos induced significant mortality from 48h, irregular swimming, tail
flexure, and the presence of subcutaneous air. Also, it induced effects on the
sounds emitted after 96h of exposure, registering less number of pulses and
higher dominant frequencies, and altered intra- and inter-specific
interactions. During the interaction phase, the larvae continued to show sound
effects, however, the antipredator mechanism continued to be operating and
efficient. Finally, it was possible to model the behavior of the larvae under
the effects of chlorpyrifos. We conclude that experimental data and
computational modeling matched within errors. Therefore, computational
simulation is a valuable ecotoxicological tool that provides new information
and allows predicting natural processes.

combining a Michelson interferometer with optical cavities, suspended masses,
and now, squeezed quantum states of light. These states modify the measurement
process of the LIGO, VIRGO and GEO600 interferometers to reduce the quantum
noise that masks astrophysical signals; thus, improvements to squeezing are
essential to further expand our gravitational view of the universe. Further
reducing quantum noise will require both lowering decoherence from losses as
well more sophisticated manipulations to counter the quantum back-action from
radiation pressure. Both tasks require fully understanding the physical
interactions between squeezed light and the many components of km-scale
interferometers. To this end, data from both LIGO observatories in observing
run three are expressed using frequency-dependent metrics to analyze each
detector's quantum response to squeezed states. The response metrics are
derived and used to concisely describe physical mechanisms behind squeezing's
simultaneous interaction with transverse-mode selective optical cavities and
the quantum radiation pressure noise of suspended mirrors. These metrics and
related analysis are broadly applicable for cavity-enhanced optomechanics
experiments that incorporate external squeezing, and -- for the first time --
give physical descriptions of every feature so far observed in the quantum

this end, we systematically explore the design space of a relative depth

and ablation studies, even an existing architecture can reach highly
competitive performance to the state of the art, with a fraction of the
complexity. Our study spans an in-depth backbone model selection process,

(SDO) records line-of-sight Dopplergram images of convective flows on the

We design a pipeline to process the raw images to remove large-scale features
like differential rotation, meridional circulation, limb shift and imaging
artefacts. The Hierarchical Equal Area Pixelization scheme (HEALPix) is used to
perform spherical harmonic transforms on the cleaned image. Because we only
have access to line-of-sight velocities on half the solar surface, we define a
""mixing matrix"" to relate the observed and true spectra. This enables the
inference of poloidal and toroidal flow spectra in a single step through the
inversion of the mixing matrix. Performing inversions on a number of flow
profiles, we find that the poloidal flow recovery is most reliable among all
the components. We also find that the poloidal spectrum is in qualitative
agreement with inferences from Local Correlation Tracking (LCT) of granules.
The fraction of power in vertical motions increases as a function of wavenumber
and is at 8% level for $\ell = 1500$. In contrast to seismic results and LCT,
the flows show nearly no temporal-frequency dependence. Poloidal flow power
peaks in the range of $\ell - |m| \approx 150-250$ which may potentially hint
at a latitudinal preference for convective flows.

the potential of wake steering as a strategy for mitigating power reduction and
unsteady loading of downstream turbines in wind farms. We first estimate the
distribution of the shed vorticity at the wake edge due to both yaw offset and
rotating blades. By considering the wake edge as an ideally thin vortex sheet,
we describe its evolution in time moving with the flow. Vortex sheet equations
are solved using a power series expansion method, and an approximate solution
for the wake shape is obtained. The vortex sheet time evolution is then mapped
into a spatial evolution by using a convection velocity. Apart from the wake
shape, the lateral deflection of the wake including ground effects is modelled.
Our results show that there exists a universal solution for the shape of curled
wakes if suitable dimensionless variables are employed. For the case of
turbulent boundary layer inflow, the decay of vortex sheet circulation due to
turbulent diffusion is included. Finally, we modify the Gaussian wake model by
incorporating the predicted shape and deflection of the curled wake, so that we
can calculate the wake profiles behind yawed turbines. Model predictions are
validated against large-eddy simulations and laboratory experiments for

the experimental tool of choice for probing correlation and interaction effects
in one-dimensional (1D) electron systems. We start by introducing the
Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid (TLL) model, showing how it marks a clear departure
from Fermi-liquid theory. We then present some early experimental results
obtained using tunnelling devices and how they contributed to the decisive
observation of both spin-charge separation and power-law behaviour. Other
experimental techniques, such as photoemission and transport measurements, are
also discussed. In the second half of the chapter we introduce two nonlinear
models that are counterparts to the TLL theory, known as the mobile-impurity

the critical case $\alpha=1$ and establish a couple of global existence results
of smooth solutions, together with a full description of their long time

initial entropy condition and the other is a small data result. In fact, using
Duhamel's approach we get that any solution is almost Lipschitz-continuous in
space. We extend the notion of weak solution for $\alpha\in[1,2)$ and prove the
existence of global Leray-Hopf solutions. Furthermore, we give an anisotropic
Onsager-type criteria for the validity of the natural energy law for weak
solutions of the system. Finally, we provide a series of quantitative estimates
that show how far the density of the limiting flock is from a uniform
distribution depending solely on the size of the initial entropy.

performance using a fair, reproducible and reliable method. The Collaboratory
for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) conducts such prospective
earthquake forecasting experiments around the globe. One metric that has been
proposed to rank competing models is the Parimutuel Gambling score, which has
the advantage of allowing alarm-based (categorical) forecasts to be compared
with probabilistic ones. Here we examine the suitability of this score for
ranking competing earthquake forecasts. First, we prove analytically that this
score is in general improper, meaning that, on average, it does not prefer the
model that generated the data. Even in the special case where it is proper, we
show it can still be used in an improper way. Then, we compare its performance
with two commonly-used proper scores (the Brier and logarithmic scores), taking
into account the uncertainty around the observed average score. We estimate the
confidence intervals for the expected score difference which allows us to
define if and when a model can be preferred. Our findings suggest the
Parimutuel Gambling score should not be used to distinguishing between multiple
competing forecasts. They also enable a more rigorous approach to distinguish
between the predictive skills of candidate forecasts in addition to their
rankings.

lead researchers to develop hybrid satellite-terrestrial (HST) networks as a
substitution to the conventional cellular terrestrial systems. Since an HST
network suffers from a masking effect which can be mitigated by adopting the
terrestrial relaying strategy, in this work, we focus on wireless multicasting
through an HST relaying net-work (HSTRN) in which a satellite sends messages to
multiple terrestrial nodes via multiple relays under the wiretapping efforts of
multiple eavesdroppers. Our concern is to protect the multicast messages from
being eavesdropped taking advantage of the well-known opportunistic relaying
technique. We consider the satellite links follow Shadowed Rician fading
whereas the terrestrial links undergo alpha-mu fading. The secrecy performance
of the proposed HSTRN model is accomplished by deriving expressions for the
probability of nonzero secrecy multicast capacity, ergodic secrecy multicast
capacity, and secure outage probability for multicasting in closed-form.
Capitalizing on the derived expressions, we analyze how a perfect secrecy level
can be preserved in spite of harsh channel conditions and also present a
secrecy trade-off in terms of the number of relays, multicast users, and
multiple eavesdroppers. Finally, the numerical analyses are corroborated via
Monte-Carlo simulations.

classical due to the fact that the original vector space of portfolio payoffs
is not a vector lattice. In contrast to a classical stochastic setting, where
price processes are associated to conditional expectations (with respect to

questionable when there is no identifiable coordinate associated with the
barrier. The model consists of two Gaussian Orthogonal Ensembles (GOE) of
internal levels coupled to each other and to the wave functions in the entrance

from the model under some easily justifiable approximations. In particular, the
assumption in transition-state theory that the reaction rates are insensitive
to the decay widths of the internal states on the far side of the barrier is
fulfilled for broad range of Hamiltonian parameters. More doubtful is the
common assumption that the transmission factor $T$ across the barrier is unity
or can be modeled by a one-dimensional Hamiltonian giving $T$ close to unity
above the barrier. This is not the case in the model; we find that the
transmission factor only approaches one under special conditions that are not

continuation of the AdS partition function is seen to define the no-boundary
wave function (in dS) uniquely in the simplest minisuperspace model. A
consideration of the AdS gravitational path integral implies that on the dS
side, saddle points with Hawking-Moss/Coleman-De Luccia-type tunnelling
geometries are irrelevant. This implies that simple topology changing
geometries do not contribute to the nucleation of the universe. The analytic
AdS/dS equivalence holds up once tensor fluctuations are added. It also works,
at the level of the saddle point approximation, when a scalar field with a mass
term is included, though in the latter case, it is the mass that must be
analytically continued. Our results illustrate the emergence of time from space
by means of a Stokes phenomenon, in the case of positive vacuum energy.
Furthermore, we arrive at a new characterisation of the no-boundary condition,

down without a successful agreement in 2018; in this time, around 200 German

Elsevier to restrict journal access at those institutions from July 2018
onwards. We investigated the effect of these access restrictions on
researchers' publishing and citing behaviours from a bibliometric perspective,
using a dataset of ~410,000 articles published by researchers at the affected
DEAL institutions between 2012-2020. We further investigated these effects with
respect to the timing of contract cancellations with Elsevier, research

evidence for a decrease in Elsevier's market share of articles from DEAL

than changes in publishing volume. We conclude that Elsevier access
restrictions have led to some reduced willingness of researchers at DEAL
institutions to publish their research in Elsevier journals, but that
researchers are not strongly affected in their ability to cite Elsevier
articles, with the implication that researchers use a variety of other methods

the probabilistic model of population protocols. Our protocols operate under
the assumption that the size $n$ of the population is embedded in the
transition function. Our labeling protocols are silent w.h.p., i.e., eventually
each agent reaches its final state and remains in it forever w.h.p., as well as
safe, i.e., never update the label assigned to any single agent. We first
present a fast, silent w.h.p.and safe labeling protocol for which the required
number of interactions is asymptotically optimal, i.e., $O(n \log n/\epsilon)$
w.h.p. It uses $(2+\epsilon)n+O(n^c)$ states, for any $c<1,$ and the label
range $1,\dots,(1+\epsilon)n.$ Furthermore, we consider the so-called pool
labeling protocols that include our fast protocol. We show that the expected
number of interactions required by any pool protocol is $\ge \frac{n^2}{r+1}$,
when the labels range is $1,\dots, n+r<2n.$ Next, we provide a protocol which
is silent and safe once a unique leader is provided, and uses only $n+5\sqrt n
+O(n^c)$ states, for any $c<1,$ and draws labels from the range $1,\dots,n.$
The expected number of interactions required by the protocol is $O(n^3).$ On
the other hand, we show that (even if a unique leader is given in advance) any
silent protocol that produces a valid labeling and is safe with probability
$>1-\frac 1n$, uses $\ge n+\sqrt {n-1} -1$ states. Hence, our protocol is
almost state-optimal. We also present a generalization of the protocol to
include a trade-off between the number of states and the expected number of
interactions. Furthermore, we show that for any silent and safe labeling
protocol utilizing $n+t<2n$ states the expected number of interactions required
to achieve a valid labeling is $\ge \frac{n^2}{t+1}$.

interlayer twist angle ranging from 0 to 60 degrees using Raman scattering and
photoluminescence spectroscopies. It is found that the strength of the
interlayer coupling in the studied BLs can be estimated using the energy
dependence of indirect emission versus the A$_\textrm{1g}$-E$_\textrm{2g}^1$
energy separation. Due to the hybridization of electronic states in the valence
band, the emission line related to the interlayer exciton is apparent in both
the natural (2H) and artificial (62$^\circ$) MoS$_2$ BLs, while it is absent in
the structures with other twist angles. The interlayer coupling energy is
estimated to be of about 50 meV. The effect of temperature on energies and
intensities of the direct and indirect emission lines in MoS$_2$ bilayers is
also quantified.

revolves around the possible occurrence of droplets that could get secluded by

$X[{\bf n}]$ - which contains $n_x$ copies of each point $x$ - by computing the
determinant of the distance matrix of $X[{\bf n}]$ and removing an exponential
factor. We prove that as a function of the sizes $n_x$, $p_X({\bf n})$ is a
polynomial, is multi-affine, and is real-stable. This naturally associates a
hitherto unstudied delta-matroid to each metric space $X$; we produce another
novel delta-matroid for each tree, which interestingly does not generalize to
all graphs.
  We next specialize to the case of $X = G$ a connected unweighted graph - so
$p_G$ is ""partially symmetric"" in $\{ n_v : v \in V(G) \}$ - and show three
further results: (a) We show that the polynomial $p_G$ is indeed a graph

$u_G(x) := p_G(x,\dots,x)$ is a transform of the characteristic polynomial of
the distance matrix $D_G$; this connects the blowup-polynomial of $G$ to the
well-studied ""distance spectrum"" of $G$. (c) We obtain a novel characterization

while allowing for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Massive neutrino and baryonic
physics are two of the most relevant such effects. We present an integration of
the halo model reaction frameworks for massive neutrinos and
beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies. The integrated halo model reaction, combined
with a pseudo power spectrum modelled by HMCode2020 is then compared against
$N$-body simulations that include both massive neutrinos and an $f(R)$
modification to gravity. We find that the framework is 4% accurate down to at
least $k\approx 3 \, h/{\rm Mpc}$ for a modification to gravity of $|f_{\rm

0.15$ eV. We also find that the framework is 4% consistent with EuclidEmulator2
as well as the Bacco emulator for \B{most of the considered} $\nu w$CDM

against hydrodynamical simulations employing HMCode2020's baryonic feedback
modelling on top of the halo model reaction. For $\nu \Lambda$CDM cosmologies
we find 2% accuracy for $M_\nu \leq 0.48$eV down to at least $k\approx 5h$/Mpc.
Similar accuracy is found when comparing to $\nu w$CDM hydrodynamical
simulations with $M_\nu = 0.06$eV. This offers the first non-linear,
theoretically general means of accurately including massive neutrinos for
beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, and further suggests that baryonic, massive
neutrino and dark energy physics can be reliably modelled independently.

popular Deep Learning-based models are often miscalibrated, and due to their

predictions. We compare three different approaches to obtaining probabilistic
models based on convolutional neural networks in a Bayesian formalism, namely
Deep Ensembles, Concrete Dropout, and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian
(SWAG). These methods are consistently applied to fault detection case studies
where Deep Ensembles use independently trained models to provide fault

technique to approximate Bayesian neural networks, and finally, we apply SWAG,
a recent method that is based on the Bayesian inference equivalence of
mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent. We provide quantitative results in

qualitative results on synthetic and real seismic datasets. Our results show
that the approximate Bayesian methods, Concrete Dropout and SWAG, both provide

(NH) surface air temperature trends it is important to have reliable estimates
of both quantities. 16 different TSI estimates were compiled from the
literature. 1/2 of these estimates are low variability and 1/2 are high
variability. 5 largely-independent methods for estimating NH temperature trends
were evaluated using: 1) only rural weather stations; 2) all available stations
whether urban or rural (the standard approach); 3) only sea surface
temperatures; 4) tree-ring temperature proxies; 5) glacier length temperature
proxies. The standard estimates using urban as well as rural stations were
anomalous as they implied a much greater warming in recent decades than the
other estimates. This suggests urbanization bias might still be a problem in
current global temperature datasets despite the conclusions of some earlier
studies. Still, all 5 estimates confirm it is currently warmer than the late
19th century, i.e., there has been some global warming since 1850. For the 5
estimates of NH temperatures, the contribution from direct solar forcing for
all 16 estimates of TSI was evaluated using simple linear least-squares
fitting. The role of human activity in recent warming was then calculated by
fitting the residuals to the UN IPCC's recommended anthropogenic forcings time
series. For all 5 NH temperature series, different TSI estimates implied
everything from recent global warming being mostly human-caused to it being
mostly natural. It seems previous studies (including the most recent IPCC
reports) that had prematurely concluded the former failed to adequately
consider all the relevant estimates of TSI and/or to satisfactorily address the
uncertainties still associated with NH temperature trend estimates. Several
recommendations are provided on how future research could more satisfactorily
resolve these issues.

analyse the time dependence of correlation functions of operators. We study
them in the ergodic limit as well as their approach to the ergodic limit which
is controlled by non-universal massive modes. An effective field theory (EFT)
corresponding to the causal symmetry and its breaking describes the ergodic

topological expansion, analogous to the one described in arXiv:2008.02271 with
added operator sources, whose leading non-trivial topologies give rise to the
universal ramp seen in correlation functions. The ergodic behaviour of
operators in our EFT is seen to result from a combination of RMT-like spectral
statistics and Haar averaging over wave-functions. Furthermore we analytically
capture the plateau behaviour by taking into account the contribution of a
second saddle point. Our main interest are quantum many-body systems with
holographic duals and we explicitly establish the validity of the EFT
description in the SYK-class of models, starting from their microscopic
description. By studying the tower of massive modes above the Goldstone sector

diffusive transport. We show that gravitational collapse of the proto-galaxy

small-scale magnetic dynamo. As the shock propagates outwards and the
associated turbulence decays, the large velocity shear between the
supersonically rotating cool disc with respect to the (partially)
pressure-supported hot circumgalactic medium excites Kelvin-Helmholtz surface
and body modes. Those inject turbulence and drive multiple small-scale dynamos,
which exponentially amplify magnetic fields. They grow in scale to reach
equipartition with thermal and CR energies in Milky Way-mass galaxies. In small
galaxies, the magnetic energy saturates at the turbulent energy while it fails
to reach equipartition with thermal and CR energies. We solve for steady-state
spectra of CR protons, secondary electrons/positrons from hadronic CR-proton
interactions with the interstellar medium, and primary shock-accelerated
electrons at supernovae. The radio-synchrotron emission is dominated by primary
electrons, irradiates the magnetised disc, bulge, and bubble-shaped
magnetically-loaded outflows of our simulated Milky Way-mass galaxy. Our
star-forming and star-bursting galaxies with saturated magnetic fields match
the global FIR-radio correlation (FRC) across four orders of magnitude. Its
intrinsic scatter arises due to (i) different magnetic saturation levels that
result from different seed magnetic fields, (ii) different radio synchrotron

critical for understanding the high-redshift universe. To this end, the nearly
linear, tight correlation of far-infrared (FIR) and radio luminosity of
star-forming galaxies is widely used. While the FIR is linked to massive star
formation, which also generates shock-accelerated cosmic ray (CR) electrons and
radio synchrotron emission, a detailed understanding of the underlying physics
is still lacking. Hence, we perform three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical
(MHD) simulations of isolated galaxies over a broad range of halo masses and
SFRs using the moving-mesh code AREPO, and evolve the CR proton energy density
self-consistently. In post-processing, we calculate the steady-state spectra of
primary, shock-accelerated and secondary CR electrons, which result from
hadronic CR proton interactions with the interstellar medium. The resulting
total radio luminosities correlate with the FIR luminosities as observed and
are dominated by primary CR electrons if we account for anisotropic CR
diffusion. The increasing contribution of secondary emission up to 30 per cent
in starbursts is compensated by the larger bremsstrahlung and Coulomb losses.
CR electrons are in the calorimetric limit and lose most of their energy
through inverse Compton interactions with star-light and cosmic microwave
background (CMB) photons while less energy is converted to synchrotron
emission. This implies steep steady-state synchrotron spectra in starbursts.
Interestingly, we find that thermal free-free emission hardens the total radio
spectra at high radio frequencies and reconciles calorimetric theory with
observations while free-free absorption explains the observed low-frequency
flattening towards the central regions of starbursts.

barrier reappearance, Hubble friction alone may be insufficient to retrap the
relaxion in a large portion of the parameter space. Thus, an additional source
of friction is required, which might be provided by coupling to a dark

rolls, which slows down the relaxion by backreacting to its motion, and
efficiently creates anisotropies in the dark photon energy-momentum tensor,
sourcing gravitational waves. We calculate the spectrum of the resulting

their strong outflows determine their final fates. In this study, we calculate
grids of stellar models for a wide range of initial masses at five
metallicities (ranging from solar down to just 2% solar). We compare a recent
hydrodynamically-consistent wind prescription with two earlier frequently-used
wind recipes in stellar evolution and population synthesis modelling, and we
present the ranges of maximum final masses at core He-exhaustion for each wind
prescription and metallicity Z. Our model grids reveal qualitative differences
in mass-loss behaviour of the wind prescriptions in terms of ""convergence"".
Using the prescription from Nugis & Lamers the maximum stellar black hole is
found to converge to a value of 20-30Msun, independent of host metallicity,
however when utilising the new physically-motivated prescription from Sander &
Vink there is no convergence to a maximum black hole mass value. The final mass
is simply larger for larger initial He-star mass, which implies that the upper
black hole limit for He-stars below the pair-instability gap is set by prior
evolution with mass loss, or the pair instability itself. Quantitatively, we
find the critical Z for pair-instability (Z_PI) to be as high as 50% Zsolar,
corresponding to the host metallicity of the LMC. Moreover, while the Nugis &
Lamers prescription would not predict any black holes above the approx 130Msun
pair-instability limit, with Sander & Vink winds included, we demonstrate a
potential channel for very massive helium stars to form such massive black
holes at ~2% Zsolar or below.

measured by gravitational-wave interferometers to tell if the binary components
are of hierarchical origin, i.e. if they are themselves remnants of previous
mergers? If so, can we determine at least some of the properties of their

hierarchical mergers occupy a characteristic region in the plane composed of
the effective spin parameters $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\chi_{\rm p}$, and
therefore a measurement of these parameters can add weight to the
hierarchical-merger interpretation of some gravitational-wave events, including
GW190521. If one of the binary components has hierarchical origin and its spin
magnitude is well measured, we derive exclusion regions on the properties of
its parents: for example we infer that the parents of GW190412 (if
hierarchical) must have had unequal masses and low spins. Our formalism is
quite general, and it can be used to infer constraints on the astrophysical

GSE has a single sequence in [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] consistent with the onset of SN
Ia Fe contributions and uniformly low [Al/Fe] of $\sim -0.25$ dex. The derived
properties of the Sequoia population are strongly dependent on the kinematic
selection. We argue the selection with the least contamination is
$J_{\phi}/J_{\mbox{tot}} < -0.6$ and $(J_z - J_R)/J_{\mbox{tot}} < 0.1$. This
results in a mean [Fe/H] $\sim -1.3$ and a mean age of $12-14$ Gyr. The Sequoia
population has a complex elemental abundance distribution with mainly high
[Mg/Fe] stars. We use the GSE [Al/Fe] vs [Mg/H] abundance distribution to
inform a chemically-based selection of accreted stars, which is used to remove
possible contaminant stars from the GSE and Sequoia samples.

may be on the verge of detection by multiple current experimental avenues. The
idea is based on a large split in scales between the electroweak scale and
decoupled scalars, with relatively light higgsinos between the two. Such models
enjoy the merit of depending on very few parameters while still explaining
gauge coupling unification, dark matter, and most of the hierarchy between the
Planck and electroweak scales, and they remain undetected by past experiments.
We analyze split higgsinos in view of current and next generation experiments.
We discuss the direct and indirect detection prospects and further demonstrate

(MPS) provide valuable insights into phases of matter. While MPS-solvable
models are typically studied as isolated points in a phase diagram, they can
belong to a connected network of MPS-solvable models, which we call the MPS
skeleton. As a case study where we can completely unearth this skeleton, we
focus on the one-dimensional BDI class -- non-interacting spinless fermions
with time-reversal symmetry. This class, labelled by a topological winding
number, contains the Kitaev chain and is Jordan-Wigner-dual to various
symmetry-breaking and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) spin chains. We show
that one can read off from the Hamiltonian whether its ground state is an MPS:
defining a polynomial whose coefficients are the Hamiltonian parameters,
MPS-solvability corresponds to this polynomial being a perfect square. We
provide an explicit construction of the ground state MPS, its bond dimension
growing exponentially with the range of the Hamiltonian. This complete
characterization of the MPS skeleton in parameter space has three significant
consequences: (i) any two topologically distinct phases in this class admit a
path of MPS-solvable models between them, including the phase transition which
obeys an area law for its entanglement entropy; (ii) we illustrate that the
subset of MPS-solvable models is dense in this class by constructing a sequence
of MPS-solvable models which converge to the Kitaev chain (equivalently, the
quantum Ising chain in a transverse field); (iii) a subset of these MPS states
can be particularly efficiently processed on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum
computer.

(CANDELS) data to study the relationship between quenching and the stellar mass
surface density within the central radius of 1 kpc ($\Sigma_1$) of low-mass
galaxies (stellar mass $M_* \lesssim 10^{9.5} M_\odot$) at $0.5 \leq z < 1.5$.
Our sample is mass complete down to $\sim 10^9 M_\odot$ at $0.5 \leq z < 1.0$.
We compare the mean $\Sigma_1$ of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and quenched
galaxies (QGs) at the same redshift and $M_*$. We find that low-mass QGs have
higher $\Sigma_1$ than low-mass SFGs, similar to galaxies above $10^{10}
M_\odot$. The difference of $\Sigma_1$ between QGs and SFGs increases slightly
with $M_*$ at $M_* \lesssim 10^{10} M_\odot$ and decreases with $M_*$ at $M_*
\gtrsim 10^{10} M_\odot$. The turnover mass is consistent with the mass where
quenching mechanisms transition from internal to environmental quenching. At
$0.5 \leq z < 1.0$, we find that the $\Sigma_1$ of galaxies increases by about
0.25 dex in the green valley (i.e., the transitioning region from star forming
to fully quenched), regardless of their $M_*$. Using the observed specific star
formation rate (sSFR) gradient in the literature as a constraint, we estimate
that the quenching timescale (i.e., time spent in the transition) of low-mass
galaxies is a few ($\sim4$) Gyrs at $0.5 \leq z < 1.0$. The mechanisms
responsible for quenching need to gradually quench star formation in an
outside-in way, i.e., preferentially ceasing star formation in outskirts of
galaxies while maintaining their central star formation to increase $\Sigma_1$.
An interesting and intriguing result is the similarity of the growth of
$\Sigma_1$ in the green valley between low-mass and massive galaxies, which
suggests that the role of internal processes in quenching low-mass galaxies is
a question worthy of further investigation.

tend to live in early-formed haloes which naively leads to an opposite trend.
Here, we show that the {\sc Simba} simulation quantitatively reproduces the
colour bimodality in SHMR and reveals an inverse relationship between halo
formation time and galaxy transition time. It suggests that the origin of this
bimodality is rooted in the intrinsic variations of the cold gas content due to
halo assembly bias. {\sc Simba}'s SHMR bimodality quantitatively relies on two
aspects of its input physics: (1) Jet-mode AGN feedback, which quenches
galaxies and sets the qualitative trend; and (2) X-ray AGN feedback, which
fully quenches galaxies and yields better agreement with observations. The
interplay between the growth of cold gas and the AGN quenching in {\sc Simba}
results in the observed SHMR bimodality.

continuum quantum field theories. Unlike most such frameworks, the one offered
here is finitary: continuum theories are defined by reducing large but finite
quantum systems to subsystems with conserved entanglement patterns at short
distances. This makes it possible to start from a lattice theory and use rather
elementary mathematics to isolate the entire algebraic structure of the
corresponding low-energy continuum theory.
  The first half of this paper illustrates this approach through a persnickety
study of (1 + 1)D continuum theories that emerge from the $\mathbb{Z}_K$ clock
model at large $K$. This leads to a direct lattice derivation of many known
continuum results, such as the operator product expansion of vertex operators
in the free scalar CFT. Many new results are obtained too. For example,
self-consistency of the lattice-continuum correspondence leads to a rich, novel
proposal for the symmetry breaking structure of the clock model at weak
coupling, deep in the BKT regime. This also makes precise what one means by
""continuous"" when saying that continuous symmetries cannot be broken in (1+1)D.
  The second half of this paper is devoted to path integrals for continuum
theories of bosons and fermions defined in this finitary formalism. The path
integrals constructed here have both nonperturbative lattice definitions and
manifest continuum properties, such as symmetries under infinitesimal rotations
or dilatations. Remarkably, this setup also makes it possible to generalize
Noether's theorem to discrete symmetries.

  We answer positively to this question for median graphs $G$ with constant

propose a combinatorial algorithm computing all eccentricities of median graphs
with running time $O(2^{O(d\log d)}n)$. As a consequence, this provides us with
a linear-time algorithm determining both the diameter and the radius of median
graphs with $d = O(1)$, such as cube-free median graphs. As the hypercube of
dimension 4 is not planar, it shows also that all eccentricities of planar
median graphs can be computed in $O(n)$.

these low-energy modes in low-dimensional materials may enable nontrivial
transport phenomena. By applying lowest-order anharmonic perturbation theory to
an atomistic model of a carbon nanotube, we investigate numerically and
analytically the spectrum of three-phonon scattering channels in which at least
one phonon is of low energy. Our calculations show that acoustic longitudinal
(LA), flexural (FA), and twisting (TW) modes in nanotubes exhibit a distinct
dissipative behavior in the long-wavelength limit, $|k| \rightarrow 0$, which
manifests itself in scattering rates that scale as $\Gamma_{\rm{LA}}\sim
|k|^{-1/2}$, $\Gamma_{\rm{FA}}\sim k^0$, and $\Gamma_{\rm{TW}}\sim |k|^{1/2}$.
These scaling relations are a consequence of the harmonic lattice approximation
and critically depend on the condition that tubes are free of mechanical
strain. In this regard, we show that small amounts of tensile lattice strain
$\epsilon$ reduce the strength of anharmonic scattering, resulting in
strain-modulated rates that, in the long-wavelength limit, obey $\Gamma \sim
\epsilon^{r} |k|^{s}$ with $r\leq 0$ and $s\geq 1$, irrespectively of acoustic
mode polarization. Under the single-mode relaxation time approximation of the
linearized Peierls-Boltzmann equation (PBE), the long-tube limit of lattice
thermal conductivity in stress-free and stretched tube configurations can be
unambiguously characterized. Going beyond relaxation time approximations,
analytical results obtained in the present study may help to benchmark

campaigns (MDVC). However, in some regions, ideal vaccination coverage in dogs
is not obtained due to low participation in the MDVC. Travel distance to the
vaccination sites has been identified as an important barrier to participation.
We aim to increase MDVC participation by optimally placing fixed point
vaccination locations to minimize walking distance to the nearest vaccination
location. We quantified participation probability based on walking distance to
the nearest vaccination point using a Poisson regression model. The regression
was fit with survey data collected from 2016-2019. We then used a computational
recursive interchange technique to solve the facility location problem to find
a set of optimal placements of fixed point vaccination locations. Finally, we
compared predicted participation of optimally placed vaccination sites to
historical participation data from surveys collected from 2016-2019. We
identified the p-median algorithm to solve the facility location problem as
ideal for fixed point vaccination placement. We found a predicted increase in
MDVC participation if vaccination locations are placed optimally. We also found
a more even vaccination coverage with optimized vaccination sites; however, the
workload in some optimized locations increased significantly. We developed a
data-driven computational algorithm to combat an ongoing rabies epidemic by
optimally using limited resources to maximize vaccination coverage. The main
positive effects we expect if this algorithm is to be implemented would be
increased overall vaccination coverage and increased spatial evenness of
coverage. A potential negative effect could be the presence of long waiting

transport materials. Super-zethrenes are also considered to exhibit an
open-shell ground state. Zethrenes may thus serve as model compounds to
investigate nanoscale pi-magnetism. However, their synthesis is extremely
challenging due to their high reactivity. We report here a combined in-solution

super-nonazethrene - on Au(111). Using single-molecule scanning tunneling
microscopy and spectroscopy, we show that super-nonazethrene exhibits an
open-shell singlet ground state featuring a large spin polarization-driven
electronic gap of 1 eV. We obtain real-space maps of the frontier molecular
orbitals, and find that they correspond to singly occupied molecular orbitals.
In consistence with the emergence of an open-shell ground state,
high-resolution tunneling spectroscopy reveals inelastic singlet-triplet spin
excitations in super-nonazethrene, characterized by a strong intramolecular
magnetic exchange coupling of 51 meV. Further insights are gained by mean-field

ice species to simulate the observations. We present models reflecting both
molecular inheritance and chemical reset initial conditions. We find that
near-to-mid-IR absorption features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CH$_3$OH are readily

exhibit the greatest change over disk lifetime, decreasing and increasing for

ideal for constraining the vertical distribution of ices and may be able to
isolate features from ices closer to the midplane (e.g., CO) given sufficient

the quality of diamond hydrogenation has not yet been established, nor has the
specific orientation that would provide the optimum hydrogen coverage. In
addition, most theoretical work in the literature use models with 100%
hydrogenated diamond surfaces to study electronic properties, which is far from
the experimentally observed hydrogen coverage. In this work, we have carried
out a detailed study using fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations on low indices diamond surfaces i.e. (001), (013), (110), (113) and
(111) to evaluate the quality and hydrogenation thresholds on different diamond
surfaces and their possible effects on electronic properties. Our simulation
results indicate that the 100% surface hydrogenation in these surfaces is hard
to achieve because of the steric repulsion between the terminated hydrogen
atoms. Among all the considered surfaces, the (001), (110), and (113) surfaces
incorporate a larger number of hydrogen atoms and passivate the surface
dangling bonds. Our results on hydrogen stability also suggest that these
surfaces with optimum hydrogen coverage are robust under extreme conditions and
could provide homogeneous p-type surface conductivity in the diamond surfaces,

challenge in terms of meeting the high ramp rate requirements of those loads.
It might be demanding for the generators to meet the ramp rates of these loads.
Failure to meet so, might lead to stability issues. This is addressed by
conglomeration of generators and energy storage elements to handle the required
power demand posed by loads. This paper proposes an energy management strategy
based on model predictive control that incorporates the uncertainty in the load
prediction. The proposed controller optimally coordinates the power split
between the generators and energy storage elements to guarantee that the power
demand is met taking into considerations the ramp rate limitations and the load
uncertainty. A low bandwidth model consisting of a single generator and a
single energy storage element is used to validate the results of the proposed
energy management strategy. The results demonstrate the robustness of the
controller under load prediction uncertainty and demonstrate the effect of load
uncertainty on battery capacity loss.

of chiral propulsion. For the case of a rotating helix moving through a fluid
at a low Reynolds number, the method amounts to replacing the original helix
(in the limit of small pitch) by a cylinder, but with a special kind of partial
slip boundary conditions replacing the non-slip boundary conditions on the
original helix. These boundary conditions are constructed to reproduce
far-field velocities of the original problem, and are defined by a few
parameters (slipping lengths) that can be extracted from a problem in planar
rather than cylindrical geometry. We derive the chiral propulsion coefficients
for spirals, helicoids, helically modulated cylinders, and some of their
generalizations using the introduced method. In the case of spirals, we compare
our results with the ones derived by Lighthill and find a very good agreement.
The proposed method is general and can be applied to any helical shape in the
limit of a small pitch. We have established that for a broad class of helical
surfaces the dependence of the chiral propulsion on the helical angle $\theta$
is universal, $\chi\sim \cos\theta\sin 2\theta$ with the maximal propulsion
achieved at the universal angle $\theta_m = \tan^{-1}(1/\sqrt{2})\approx

traffic lights to achieve localization, but these are usually not continuously

in the gaps. However, due to elapsed time between mapping and localization, the
live GPS frame can be offset from the semantic map frame, requiring
calibration. In this paper, we propose a robust semantic localization algorithm
that self-calibrates for the offset between the live GPS and semantic map
frames by exploiting common semantic cues, including traffic lights and lane

in order to test our models against recent HST STIS observations of [O III]
emission-line kinematics since these AGNs possess more energetic outflows than
found in Seyfert galaxies. We find that the outflows within 500 pc are
consistent with radiative acceleration of dusty gas, however, the outflows in
Mrk 34 are significantly more extended and may not be directly accelerated by
radiation. We characterize the properties of X-ray winds found from the
expansion of [O III]-emitting gas close to the black hole. We show that such
winds possess the kinetic energy density to disturb [O III] gas at 1.8 kpc, and
have sufficient energy to entrain the [O III] clouds at 1.2 kpc. Assuming that
the X-ray wind possesses the same radial mass distribution as the [O III] gas,
we find that the peak kinetic luminosity for this wind is 2% of Mrk 34's

Commonly, the optimal policy overfits to the approximate model and the

underlying distributional shifts. In this paper, we present Robust Fitted Value
Iteration, which uses dynamic programming to compute the optimal value function
on the compact state domain and incorporates adversarial perturbations of the
system dynamics. The adversarial perturbations encourage a optimal policy that
is robust to changes in the dynamics. Utilizing the continuous-time perspective
of reinforcement learning, we derive the optimal perturbations for the states,
actions, observations and model parameters in closed-form. Notably, the
resulting algorithm does not require discretization of states or actions.
Therefore, the optimal adversarial perturbations can be efficiently
incorporated in the min-max value function update. We apply the resulting
algorithm to the physical Furuta pendulum and cartpole. By changing the masses
of the systems we evaluate the quantitative and qualitative performance across
different model parameters. We show that robust value iteration is more robust

levels of abstraction. In a sequence of stages, players first learn to control
a fully articulated body to perform realistic, human-like movements such as
running and turning; they then acquire mid-level football skills such as
dribbling and shooting; finally, they develop awareness of others and play as a
team, bridging the gap between low-level motor control at a timescale of
milliseconds, and coordinated goal-directed behaviour as a team at the
timescale of tens of seconds. We investigate the emergence of behaviours at
different levels of abstraction, as well as the representations that underlie
these behaviours using several analysis techniques, including statistics from
real-world sports analytics. Our work constitutes a complete demonstration of

photometry, angular diameter, stellar effective temperature, and RV
measurements in a global modelling of the pulsation. We obtained new
photometric measurements at mid-IR with the VLT/VISIR complemented with
literature data. We then compared the mean magnitude from 0.5$\mu$m to 70$\mu$m
with stellar atmosphere models to infer the IR excess, which we attribute to
the presence of a CSE. We report that at least 29% of our sample have a
detected IR excess. We estimated a mean excess of 0.08mag in K and 0.13mag in
N. Other Cepheids possibly have IR excess, but they were rejected due to their
low detection level compared to a single-star model. We do not see any
correlation between the IR excess and the pulsation period as previously
suspected for MW Cepheids, but a rather constant trend. We also do not find any
correlation between the CO absorption and the presence of a CSE, but rather
with the stellar effective temperature, which confirms that the CO features
previously reported are mostly photospheric. No bias caused by the presence of
the CSE is detected on the average distance estimates from a SPIPS analysis
with a fitted colour excess. We also do not find correlation between the
presence of IR excess and the evolution stage. We report a fraction of 29% of
Cepheids with an IR excess likely produced by the CSE. Longer period Cepheids
do not exhibit greater excess than short periods as previously suspected from
observations and theoretical dusty-wind models. Other mechanisms such as
free-free emission, among others, may be at the origin of their formation. We
also show that not fitting the colour excess leads to a bias on the distance

establish the first link between microscopic, particle-based material models

well-known damage and fragmentation energy phases, then we show that the former
is split into the abrasion phase with infinite sample lifetime, analogous to
Sternberg's Law, at finite asymptotic mass and the cleavage phase with finite
sample lifetime, decreasing as a power law of the impact velocity, analogous to
Basquin's Law. We demonstrate that only in the abrasion phase does shape
evolution emerging in microscopic material models reproduce with startling
accuracy the spatio-temporal patterns predicted by macroscopic mean field
approaches. Our results substantially extend the phase diagram of impact
phenomena and set the boundaries of the applicability of geometric mean field
theories for geological shape evolution. Additionally, the scaling laws
obtained can be exploited for quantitative predictions of evolution histories.

not harm optimality. Although it is often not possible to compute the minimum

essential for the further advancement of FEBID-based nanofabrication. The
developed computational methodology is general and applicable to different

In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a
binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast
computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial
network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning
process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into
binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training
of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from
synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is
directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the
model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better
maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other
vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to
the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of
our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of

function. Choosing a neural network architecture for any task is as complex as
searching the space of those functions. For the last few years, 'neural
architecture design' has been largely synonymous with 'neural architecture
search' (NAS), i.e. brute-force, large-scale search. NAS has yielded
significant gains on practical tasks. However, NAS methods end up searching for
a local optimum in architecture space in a small neighborhood around
architectures that often go back decades, based on CNN or LSTM.
  In this work, we present a different and complementary approach to
architecture design, which we term 'zero-shot architecture design' (ZSAD). We
develop methods that can predict, without any training, whether an architecture
will achieve a relatively high test or training error on a task after training.
We then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition
itself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this
explanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep
learning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first
line of code is written, even for tasks for which no prior art exists.
  Our first major contribution is to show that the 'degree of nonlinearity' of
a neural architecture is a key causal driver behind its performance, and a
primary aspect of the architecture's model complexity. We introduce the
'nonlinearity coefficient' (NLC), a scalar metric for measuring nonlinearity.
Via extensive empirical study, we show that the value of the NLC in the
architecture's randomly initialized state before training is a powerful
predictor of test error after training and that attaining a right-sized NLC is
essential for attaining an optimal test error. The NLC is also conceptually
simple, well-defined for any feedforward network, easy and cheap to compute,
has extensive theoretical, empirical and conceptual grounding, follows
instructively from the architecture definition, and can be easily controlled
via our 'nonlinearity normalization' algorithm. We argue that the NLC is the
most powerful scalar statistic for architecture design specifically and neural
network analysis in general. Our analysis is fueled by mean field theory, which
we use to uncover the 'meta-distribution' of layers.
  Beyond the NLC, we uncover and flesh out a range of metrics and properties
that have a significant explanatory influence on test and training error. We go
on to explain the majority of the error variation across a wide range of
randomly generated architectures with these metrics and properties. We compile
our insights into a practical guide for architecture designers, which we argue
can significantly shorten the trial-and-error phase of deep learning
deployment.
  Our results are grounded in an experimental protocol that exceeds that of the
vast majority of other deep learning studies in terms of carefulness and rigor.
We study the impact of e.g. dataset, learning rate, floating-point precision,
loss function, statistical estimation error and batch inter-dependency on
performance and other key properties. We promote research practices that we
believe can significantly accelerate progress in architecture design research.

plasma is determined by the balance between the hydrostatic pressure in the
fluid and the magnetic forces generated by an array of external coils and the
plasma itself. The location of the plasma is not known a priori and must be
obtained as the solution to a free boundary problem. The partial differential
equation that determines the behavior of the combined magnetic field depends on
a set of physical parameters (location of the coils, intensity of the electric
currents going through them, magnetic permeability, etc.) that are subject to
uncertainty and variability. The confinement region is in turn a function of
these stochastic parameters as well. In this work, we consider variations on
the current intensities running through the external coils as the dominant
source of uncertainty. This leads to a parameter space of dimension equal to
the number of coils in the reactor. With the aid of a surrogate function built
on a sparse grid in parameter space, a Monte Carlo strategy is used to explore
the effect that stochasticity in the parameters has on important features of
the plasma boundary such as the location of the x-point, the strike points, and
shaping attributes such as triangularity and elongation. The use of the
surrogate function reduces the time required for the Monte Carlo simulations by
factors that range between 7 and over 30.

through the Micro-Instruction Translation Engine (MITE), through the Decode

contouring and ringing effects on the reconstructed frames and introduce
various blocking artifacts at block boundaries. To suppress those visual
artifacts, the VVC framework supports four post-processing filter operations.
The interoperation of these filters introduces extra signaling bits and
eventually becomes overhead at higher resolution video processing. In this
paper, a novel deep learning-based model is proposed for sample adaptive offset
(SAO) nonlinear filtering operation and substantiated the merits of intra-inter
frame quality enhancement. We introduced a variable filter size multi-scale CNN
(MSCNN) to improve the denoising operation and incorporated strided
deconvolution for further computation improvement. We demonstrated that our
deconvolution model can effectively be trained by leveraging the high-frequency
edge features learned in a parallel fashion using feature fusion and residual

outperforms the baseline VVC method in BD-BR, BD-PSNR measurements and achieves

stars display brightness fluctuations with a decreasing power-law continuous
spectrum. K2 and Kepler observations show that the RMS flicker due to this
Mid-Frequency Continuum (MFC) can reach almost 1%, approaching the modulation
amplitude from active regions. The MFC amplitude varies by a factor up to 40
among Pleiades members with similar Teff, depending mainly on the stellar
Rossby number Ro. For Ro<0.04, the mean amplitude is roughly constant at about
0.4%; at larger Ro the amplitude decreases rapidly, shrinking by about two
orders of magnitude for Ro~1. Among stars, the MFC amplitude correlates poorly
with that of modulation from rotating active regions. Among field stars
observed for 3 years by Kepler, the quarterly average modulation amplitudes
from active regions are much more time-variable than the quarterly MFC
amplitudes. We argue that the process causing the MFC is largely magnetic in
nature, and that its power-law spectrum comes from magnetic processes distinct
from the star's global dynamo, with shorter timescales. By analogy with solar
phenomena, we hypothesize that the MFC arises from a (sometimes energetic)
variant of the solar magnetic network, perhaps combined with rotation-related
changes in the morphology of supergranules.

turbulent ocean. To do this efficiently, the plankton can use a gyrotactic
mechanism, aligning them with gravity to swim downwards, or against gravity to
swim upwards. Many species show passive mechanisms for gyrotactic stability.
For example, bottom-heavy plankton tend to align upwards. This is efficient for
upward migration in quiescent flows, but it is often sensitive to turbulence
which upsets the alignment. Here we suggest a simple, robust active mechanism
for gyrotactic stability, which is only lightly affected by turbulence and
allows alignment both along and against gravity. We use a model for a plankton
that swims with a constant speed and can actively steer in response to
hydrodynamic signals encountered in simulations of a turbulent flow. Using
reinforcement learning, we identify the optimal steering strategy. By using its
setae to sense its settling velocity transversal to its swimming direction, the
swimmer can deduce information about the direction of gravity, allowing it to
actively align upwards. The mechanism leads to a rate of upward migration in a
turbulent flow that is of the same order as in quiescent flows, unless the
turbulence is very vigorous. In contrast, passive swimmers with typical
parameters of copepods show much smaller upward velocity in turbulence.
Settling may even cause them to migrate downwards in vigorous turbulence.

current research of assembly based modeling is not directly applicable to
modern CAD systems because it eschews the dominant data structure of modern
CAD: parametric boundary representations (BREPs). CAD assembly modeling defines
assemblies as a system of pairwise constraints, called mates, between parts,
which are defined relative to BREP topology rather than in world coordinates
common to existing work. We propose SB-GCN, a representation learning scheme on
BREPs that retains the topological structure of parts, and use these learned
representations to predict CAD type mates. To train our system, we compiled the
first large scale dataset of BREP CAD assemblies, which we are releasing along
with benchmark mate prediction tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility
of our model with an existing commercial CAD system by building a tool that
assists users in mate creation by suggesting mate completions, with 72.2%

detector to achieve an acceptable false alarm rate. However, tuning the
threshold is often a non-trivial task due to unknown detector output
distributions. A detector threshold that provides an acceptable false alarm
rate is equivalent to a specific quantile of the detector output distribution.
Therefore, we use quantile estimators based on order statistics to estimate the
detector threshold. The estimation of quantiles from sample data has a more
than a century long tradition and we provide three different distribution-free
finite sample guarantees for a class of quantile estimators. The first is based
on the Dworetzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality, the second utilizes the
Vysochanskij-Petunin inequality, and the third is based on exact confidence
intervals for a beta distribution. These guarantees are then compared and used
in the detector threshold tuning problem. We use both simulated data as well as
data obtained from an experimental setup with the Temperature Control Lab to
validate the guarantees provided.

DiSECt: the first differentiable simulator for cutting soft materials. The
simulator augments the finite element method (FEM) with a continuous contact
model based on signed distance fields (SDF), as well as a continuous damage
model that inserts springs on opposite sides of the cutting plane and allows
them to weaken until zero stiffness, enabling crack formation. Through various
experiments, we evaluate the performance of the simulator. We first show that
the simulator can be calibrated to match resultant forces and deformation
fields from a state-of-the-art commercial solver and real-world cutting
datasets, with generality across cutting velocities and object instances. We
then show that Bayesian inference can be performed efficiently by leveraging
the differentiability of the simulator, estimating posteriors over hundreds of

illustrate that control parameters in the simulation can be optimized to
minimize cutting forces via lateral slicing motions.

number of new applications like internet of things, autonomous car, and drone
is crowding the unlicensed spectrum. Licensed network such as the long-term
evolution (LTE) also comes to the unlicensed spectrum for better providing
high-capacity contents with low cost. However, LTE was not designed for sharing
spectrum with others. A cooperation center for these networks is costly because
they possess heterogeneous properties and everyone can enter and leave the
spectrum unrestrictedly, so the design will be challenging. Since it is
infeasible to incorporate potentially infinite scenarios with one unified
design, an alternative solution is to let each network learn its own
coexistence policy. Previous solutions only work on fixed scenarios. In this
work a reinforcement learning algorithm is presented to cope with the
coexistence between Wi-Fi and LTE agents in 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum. The
coexistence problem was modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov
decision process (Dec-POMDP) and Bayesian approach was adopted for policy
learning with nonparametric prior to accommodate the uncertainty of policy for
different agents. A fairness measure was introduced in the reward function to
encourage fair sharing between agents. The reinforcement learning was turned
into an optimization problem by transforming the value function as likelihood
and variational inference for posterior approximation. Simulation results
demonstrate that this algorithm can reach high value with compact policy
representations, and stay computationally efficient when applying to agent set.

dynamic Marginal Structural Models (MSMs). These models represent the expected
outcome under adherence to a DTR for DTRs in a family indexed by a parameter $
\psi $; the function mapping regimes in the family to the expected outcome
under adherence to a DTR is known as the value function. Models that allow for
the straightforward identification of an optimal DTR may lead to biased
estimates. If such a model is computationally tractable, common wisdom says
that a grid-search for the optimal DTR may obviate this difficulty. In a
Bayesian context, computational difficulties may be compounded if a posterior
mean must be calculated at each grid point. We seek to alleviate these
inferential challenges by implementing Gaussian Process ($ \mathcal{GP} $)
optimization methods for estimators for the causal effect of adherence to a
specified DTR. We examine how to identify optimal DTRs in settings where the
value function is multi-modal, which are often not addressed in the DTR
literature. We conclude that a $ \mathcal{GP} $ modeling approach that
acknowledges noise in the estimated response surface leads to improved results.
Additionally, we find that a grid-search may not always yield a robust solution
and that it is often less efficient than a $ \mathcal{GP} $ approach. We
illustrate the use of the proposed methods by analyzing a clinical dataset with
the aim of quantifying the effect of different patterns of HIV therapy.

protocols. We consider a population protocol model where an adaptive adversary
dictates the interactions between agents, but with probability $p$ every such
interaction may change into an interaction between two agents chosen uniformly
at random. That is, $p$-fraction of the interactions are random, while
$(1-p)$-fraction are adversarial. The aim of our model is to bridge the gap
between a uniformly random scheduler (which is too idealistic) and an
adversarial scheduler (which is too strict).
  We focus on the fundamental problem of leader election in population
protocols. We show that, for a population of size $n$, the leader election
problem can be solved in $O(p^{-2}n \log^3 n)$ steps with high probability,
using $O((\log^2 n) \cdot (\log (n/p)))$ states per agent, for \emph{all}
values of $p\leq 1$. Although our result does not match the best known running
time of $O(n \log n)$ for the uniformly random scheduler ($p=1$), we are able
to present a \emph{smooth transition} between a running time of $O(n \cdot
\mathrm{polylog} n)$ for $p=1$ and an infinite running time for the adversarial
scheduler ($p=0$), where the problem cannot be solved. The key technical
contribution of our work is a novel \emph{phase clock} algorithm for our model.
This is a key primitive for much-studied fundamental population protocol
algorithms (leader election, majority), and we believe it is of independent
interest.

to impart humanlike qualities on its movement. In this work we present a
reinforcement learning based method for teaching a real world bipedal robot to
perform movements directly from human motion capture data. Our method
seamlessly transitions from training in a simulation environment to executing
on a physical robot without requiring any real world training iterations or
offline steps. To overcome the disparity in joint configurations between the
robot and the motion capture actor, our method incorporates motion re-targeting
into the training process. Domain randomization techniques are used to
compensate for the differences between the simulated and physical systems. We
demonstrate our method on an internally developed humanoid robot with movements
ranging from a dynamic walk cycle to complex balancing and waving. Our
controller preserves the style imparted by the motion capture data and exhibits
graceful failure modes resulting in safe operation for the robot. This work was

whether for these quantities $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD simulations provide results
that can be compared with experiments or whether $N_f=2+1+1$ QCD including the
charm quark in the sea needs to be simulated. We consider two theories, $N_f=0$
QCD and QCD with $N_f=2$ charm quarks in the sea. The charm sea effects (due to
two charm quarks) are estimated comparing the results obtained in these two
theories, after matching them and taking the continuum limit. The absence of
light quarks allows us to simulate the $N_f=2$ theory at lattice spacings down
to $0.023$ fm that are crucial for reliable continuum extrapolations. We find
that sea charm quark effects are below $1\%$ for the decay constants of
charmonium. Our results show that decoupling of charm works well up to energies
of about $500$ MeV. We also compute the derivatives of the decay constants and
meson masses with respect to the charm mass. For these quantities we again do
not see a significant dynamical charm quark effect, albeit with a lower
precision. For mesons made of a charm quark and a heavy antiquark, whose mass
is twice that of the charm quark, sea effects are only about $0.1\%$ in the
ratio of vector to pseudoscalar masses.

  Blockchain",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Blockchain has received tremendous attention as a secure, distributed, and
anonymous framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). As a distributed system,
blockchain trades off scalability for distribution, which limits the
technologys adaptation for large scale networks such as IoT. All transactions
and blocks must be broadcast and verified by all participants which limits
scalability and incurs computational and communication overheads. The existing
solutions to scale blockchains have so far led to partial recentralization,
limiting the technologys original appeal. In this paper, we introduce a
distributed yet scalable Verification and Communication architecture for
blockchain referred to as Vericom. Vericom concurrently achieves high
scalability and distribution using hash function outputs to shift blockchains
from broadcast to multicast communication. Unlike conventional blockchains
where all nodes must verify new transactions/blocks, Vericom uses the hash of
IoT traffic to randomly select a set of nodes to verify transactions/blocks
which in turn reduces the processing overhead. Vericom incorporates two layers:
i) transmission layer where a randomized multicasting method is introduced
along with a backbone network to route traffic, i.e., transactions and blocks,
from the source to the destination, and ii) verification layer where a set of
randomly selected nodes are allocated to verify each transaction or block. The
performance evaluation shows that Vericom reduces the packet and processing
overhead as compared with conventional blockchains. In the worst case, packet
overhead in Vericom scales linearly with the number of nodes while the
processing overhead remains scale-independent.

why the semi-local scaling fails but the resulting eddy conductivity works
well. We conduct DNSs of Couette flows at Mach numbers from $M=1.4$ to 6. We
add a source term in the energy equation to get a cold, a close-to-adiabatic

aerodynamic heating is the answer to our question: aerodynamic heating is not
accounted for in Patel et al.'s semi-local scaling but is modeled in the
equilibrium wall model. We incorporate aerodynamic heating in semi-local

However, in high dimensional data, this identification is challenging.
Classical and recently-developed methods often perform poorly when there are
multiple influential observations in the same dataset. In particular, current
methods can fail when there is masking several influential observations with
similar characteristics, or swamping when the influential observations are near
the boundary of the space spanned by well-behaved observations. Therefore, we
propose an algorithm-based, multi-step, multiple detection procedure to
identify influential observations that addresses current limitations. Our
three-step algorithm to identify and capture undesirable variability in the
data, $\asymMIP,$ is based on two complementary statistics, inspired by
asymmetric correlations, and built on expectiles. Simulations demonstrate
higher detection power than competing methods. Use of the resulting asymptotic
distribution leads to detection of influential observations without the need

harvesting, biomedical devices, flexible electronics and sensors are some other
applications enabled by electro-active soft materials. The phenomenon of
flexoelectricity is an enticing alternative that refers to the development of
electric polarization in dielectrics when subjected to strain gradients. In
particular, flexoelectricity offers a direct linear coupling between a highly
desirable deformation mode (flexure) and electric stimulus. Unfortunately,
barring some exceptions, the flexoelectric effect is quite weak and rather
substantial bending curvatures are required for an appreciable
electro-mechanical response. Most experiments in the literature appear to
confirm modest flexoelectricity in polymers although perplexingly, a singular
work has measured a ""giant"" effect in elastomers under some specific
conditions. Due to the lack of an understanding of the microscopic
underpinnings of flexoelectricity in elastomers and a commensurate theory, it
is not currently possible to either explain the contradictory experimental
results on elastomers or pursue avenues for possible design of large
flexoelectricity. In this work, we present a statistical-mechanics theory for
the emergent flexoelectricity of elastomers consisting of polar monomers. The
theory is shown to be valid in broad generality and leads to key insights
regarding both giant flexoelectricity and material design. In particular, the
theory shows that, in standard elastomer networks, combining stretching and
bending is a mechanism for obtaining giant flexoelectricity, which also
explains the aforementioned, surprising experimental discovery.

at $\sim 1.3$ days after explosion, the object showed narrow (FWHM
$<250\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$) recombination lines of ionized helium,
nitrogen, and carbon, as typically seen in flash-spectroscopy events. Using the
non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN to model our first high resolution
spectrum, we infer a progenitor mass-loss rate of
$\dot{M}=(3.5-5.3)\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (assuming a wind
velocity of $v_w=200\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$), estimated at a radius of
$R_{\rm in}=2.5\times10^{14}\,\rm{cm}$. In addition, we find that the
progenitor of SN 2020pni was enriched in helium and nitrogen (relative
abundances in mass fractions of 0.30$-$0.40, and $8.2\times10^{-3}$,
respectively). Radio upper limits are also consistent with a dense CSM, and a
mass-loss rate of $\dot M>5 \times 10^{-4}\,\rm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$. During
the first 4 days after first light, we also observe an increase in velocity of
the hydrogen lines (from $\sim 250\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$ to $\sim
1000\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$), which suggests a complex CSM. The
presence of dense and confined CSM, as well as its inhomogeneous structure,
suggest a phase of enhanced mass loss of the progenitor of SN 2020pni during
the last year before explosion. Finally, we compare SN 2020pni to a sample of
other shock-photoionization events. We find no evidence of correlations among
the physical parameters of the explosions and the characteristics of the CSM
surrounding the progenitors of these events. This favors the idea that the
mass-loss experienced by massive stars during their final years could be
governed by stochastic phenomena, and that, at the same time, the physical
mechanisms responsible for this mass-loss must be common to a variety of
different progenitors.

the use of regression to infer a machine-learned point estimate of an unknown

repeated esitmates to build up statistics - we clarify that this
machine-learned estimator converges to the Bayesian maximum a-posterori
estimator (subject to some regularity conditions). When the number of training
measurements are large, this is identical to the well-known maximum-likelihood
estimator (MLE), and using this fact, we argue that the Cram{\'e}r-Rao
sensitivity bound applies to the mean-square error cost function and can
therefore be used to select optimal model and training parameters. We show that
the machine-learned estimator inherits the desirable asymptotic properties of
the MLE, up to a limit imposed by the resolution of the training grid.
Furthermore, we investigate the role of quantum noise the training process, and
show that this noise imposes a fundamental limit on number of grid points. This
manuscript paves the way for machine-learning to assist the calibration of
quantum sensors, thereby allowing maximum-likelihood inference to play a more
prominent role in the design and operation of the next generation of

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential

  Conventional black-box PINNs solvers have been found to suffer from a host of
issues: spectral bias in fully-connected architectures, unstable gradient
pathologies, as well as difficulties with convergence and accuracy.
  Current network training strategies are agnostic to dimension sizes and rely
on the availability of powerful computing resources to optimize through a large
number of collocation points.
  This is particularly challenging when studying stochastic dynamical systems
with the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov Equation (FPKE), a second-order PDE which is
typically solved in high-dimensional state space.
  While we focus exclusively on the stationary form of the FPKE, positivity and
normalization constraints on its solution make it all the more unfavorable to
solve directly using standard PINNs approaches.
  To mitigate the above challenges, we present a novel training strategy for
solving the FPKE using OT-based sampling to supplement the existing PINNs
framework.
  It is an iterative approach that induces a network trained on a small dataset
to add samples to its training dataset from regions where it nominally makes
the most error.
  The new samples are found by solving a linear programming problem at every
iteration.
  The paper is complemented by an experimental evaluation of the proposed
method showing its applicability on a variety of stochastic systems with

the surface of the ECO, which lies right above the Kerr horizon. The
trajectories of the infalling objects are modified from Kerr geodesics, such
that the gravitational waves propagating toward future null infinity match
those from merging black holes with comparable masses. In this way, the
corresponding echoes approximate to those from comparable-mass mergers. For

paper, we propose two improvements to train SE systems on noisy speech data.
First, we propose several modifications of the loss functions, which make them
robust against noisy speech targets. In particular, computing the median over
the sample axis before averaging over time-frequency bins allows to use such
data. Furthermore, we propose a noise augmentation scheme for mixture-invariant
training (MixIT), which allows using it also in such scenarios. For our
experiments, we use the Mozilla Common Voice dataset and we show that using our
robust loss function improves PESQ by up to 0.19 compared to a system trained
in the traditional way. Similarly, for MixIT we can see an improvement of up to
0.27 in PESQ when using our proposed noise augmentation.

simultaneously, which aim to transfer the makeup from a reference image to a
source image and remove the makeup from the with-makeup image respectively.
Existing methods have achieved much advancement in constrained scenarios, but
it is still very challenging for them to transfer makeup between images with
large pose and expression differences, or handle makeup details like blush on
cheeks or highlight on the nose. In addition, they are hardly able to control
the degree of makeup during transferring or to transfer a specified part in the
input face. In this work, we propose the PSGAN++, which is capable of
performing both detail-preserving makeup transfer and effective makeup removal.
For makeup transfer, PSGAN++ uses a Makeup Distill Network to extract makeup
information, which is embedded into spatial-aware makeup matrices. We also
devise an Attentive Makeup Morphing module that specifies how the makeup in the
source image is morphed from the reference image, and a makeup detail loss to
supervise the model within the selected makeup detail area. On the other hand,
for makeup removal, PSGAN++ applies an Identity Distill Network to embed the
identity information from with-makeup images into identity matrices. Finally,
the obtained makeup/identity matrices are fed to a Style Transfer Network that
is able to edit the feature maps to achieve makeup transfer or removal. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our PSGAN++, we collect a Makeup Transfer In the
Wild dataset that contains images with diverse poses and expressions and a
Makeup Transfer High-Resolution dataset that contains high-resolution images.
Experiments demonstrate that PSGAN++ not only achieves state-of-the-art results
with fine makeup details even in cases of large pose/expression differences but
also can perform partial or degree-controllable makeup transfer.

approximate Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games with imperfect

which limits its scalability in larger games. When applying CFR to solve
large-scale games in previously, large-scale games are abstracted into
small-scale games firstly. Secondly, CFR is used to solve the abstract game.
And finally, the solution strategy is mapped back to the original large-scale
game. However, this process requires considerable expert knowledge, and the
accuracy of abstraction is closely related to expert knowledge. In addition,
the abstraction also loses certain information, which will eventually affect
the accuracy of the solution strategy. Towards this problem, a recent method,
\textit{Deep CFR} alleviates the need for abstraction and expert knowledge by
applying deep neural networks directly to CFR in full games. In this paper, we
introduces \textit{Neural Network Counterfactual Regret Minimization (NNCFR)},
an improved variant of \textit{Deep CFR} that has a faster convergence by
constructing a dueling netwok as the value network. Moreover, an evaluation

reduces the approximation error of the value network. In addition, a new loss

  (ICRA2021)",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We investigate what grade of sensor data is required for training an
imitation-learning-based AV planner on human expert demonstration.
Machine-learned planners are very hungry for training data, which is usually
collected using vehicles equipped with the same sensors used for autonomous
operation. This is costly and non-scalable. If cheaper sensors could be used
for collection instead, data availability would go up, which is crucial in a
field where data volume requirements are large and availability is small. We
present experiments using up to 1000 hours worth of expert demonstration and
find that training with 10x lower-quality data outperforms 1x AV-grade data in
terms of planner performance. The important implication of this is that cheaper
sensors can indeed be used. This serves to improve data access and democratize
the field of imitation-based motion planning. Alongside this, we perform a
sensitivity analysis of planner performance as a function of perception range,
field-of-view, accuracy, and data volume, and the reason why lower-quality data
still provide good planning results.

in four NICER observations of MAXI J1348-630. By comparing the spectra of the
period with and without the type-B QPO, we found that the main difference
appears at energy bands above ~2 keV, suggesting that the QPO emission is
dominated by the hard Comptonised component. During the transition, a change in
the relative contribution of the disk and Comptonised emission was observed.
The disk flux decreased while the Comptonised flux increased from non-QPO to
type-B QPO. However, the total flux did not change too much in the NICER band.
Our results reveal that the type-B QPO is associated with a redistribution of
accretion power between the disk and Comptonised emission. When the type-B QPO
appears, more accretion power is dissipated into the Comptonised region than in
the disk. Our spectral fits give a hint that the increased Comptonised emission
may come from an additional component that is related to the base of the jet.

graphene-like clusters on the SiC wafers is done by annealing the wafers in a

evaluating the quality of the growth method, the Raman spectra and infrared
intensities of graphene-like clusters are studied theoretically and
experimentally. For doing the theoretical study, three types of graphene
clusters are considered and their Raman spectrum and infrared intensities are
found using the Hartree-Fock method. The results show that the geometry of the
cluster, and in consequence the geometry-dependent high (low) non-uniformity of
charge distribution on the cluster surfaces causes the high (low) infrared
intensities. The experimental spectrums are measured and compared with the
theoretical ones. An agreement was seen between the experimental and

shown that more accurate temperature control and higher vacuum level of the

spectra of light mesons and glueballs satisfying linear Regge trajectories. It
is also an interesting tool to represent the confinement/deconfinement
transition of a gauge theory, that is pictured as a Hawking-Page transition
from a dual geometry with no horizon to a black hole space. A very interesting
tool to analyze stability of general physical systems that are localized in
space is the configuration (or complexity) entropy (CE). This quantity,
inspired in Shannon information entropy, is defined in terms of the energy
density of the system in momentum space. The purpose of this work is to use the
CE to investigate the stability of the soft wall background as a function of
the temperature. A nontrivial aspect is that the geometry is an anti-de Sitter
black hole, that has a singular energy density. In order to make it possible to
calculate the CE, we first propose a regularized form for the black hole energy
density. Then, calculating the CE, it is observed that its behavior is
consistently related to the black hole instability in anti-de Sitter space.
Another interesting result that emerges from this analysis is that the
regularized energy density shows a behavior similar to the Wien law, satisfied
by black body radiation. That means: the momentum $ k_{max} $ where the energy
density is maximum, varies with the temperature $T$ obeying the relation: $ T /
k_{max} = constant $ in the deconfined phase.

SLAM, which in general exhibits a tight coupling between classification, metric
SLAM and planning under uncertainty. We contribute a unified framework for
inference and belief space planning (BSP) that addresses prominent sources of
uncertainty in this context: classification aliasing (classier cannot
distinguish between candidate classes from certain viewpoints), classifier
epistemic uncertainty (classifier receives data ""far"" from its training set),
and localization uncertainty (camera and object poses are uncertain).
Specifically, we develop two methods for maintaining a joint distribution over
robot and object poses, and over posterior class probability vector that
considers epistemic uncertainty in a Bayesian fashion. The first approach is
Multi-Hybrid (MH), where multiple hybrid beliefs over poses and classes are
maintained to approximate the joint belief over poses and posterior class
probability. The second approach is Joint Lambda Pose (JLP), where the joint
belief is maintained directly using a novel JLP factor. Furthermore, we extend
both methods to BSP, planning while reasoning about future posterior epistemic
uncertainty indirectly, or directly via a novel information-theoretic reward
function. Both inference methods utilize a novel viewpoint-dependent classifier
uncertainty model that leverages the coupling between poses and classification
scores and predicts the epistemic uncertainty from certain viewpoints. In
addition, this model is used to generate predicted measurements during
planning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reasons
about classifier epistemic uncertainty within semantic SLAM and BSP.

ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) system, in which an IRS is
dedicatedly deployed to assist a base station (BS) to send individual
short-packet messages to multiple users. To enhance the URLLC performance, the
users are divided into different groups and the messages for users in each
group are encoded into a single codeword. By considering the time division
multiple access (TDMA) protocol among different groups, our objective is to
minimize the total latency for all users subject to their individual
reliability requirements, via jointly optimizing the user grouping and
block-length allocation at the BS together with the reflective beamforming at
the IRS. We solve the latency minimization problem via the alternating
optimization, in which the blocklengths and the reflective beamforming are
optimized by using the techniques of successive convex approximation (SCA) and
semi-definite relaxation (SDR), while the user grouping is updated by K-means
and greedy-based methods. Numerical results show that the proposed designs can
significantly reduce the communication latency, as compared to various
benchmark schemes, which unveil the importance of user grouping and reflective
beamforming optimization for exploiting the joint encoding gain and enhancing

surfactant decreases the dynamic receding contact angle even at a concentration
much lower than the critical micelle concentration (CMC). To better understand
why surfactants have such a drastic effect on drop dynamics, we constructed a
dedicated a setup on an inverted microscope, in which an aqueous drop is held
stationary while the transparent substrate is moved horizontally. Using
astigmatism particle tracking velocimetry, we track the 3D displacement of the
tracer particles in the flow. We study how surfactants alter the flow dynamics
near the receding contact line of a moving drop for capillary numbers in the
order of $10^{-6}$. Even for surfactant concentrations $c$ far below the
critical micelle concentration ($c \ll$ CMC) Marangoni stresses change the flow
drastically. We discuss our results first in a 2D model that considers
advective and diffusive surfactant transport and deduce estimates of the

Marangoni stress with the distance from the contact line suggests that the 2D
advection-diffusion model has to be extended to a full 3D model. The effect is
ubiquitous, since surfactant is present in many technical and natural dewetting
processes either deliberately or as contamination.

element g of G. It turns out [Gurevich-Howe15, Gurevich-Howe17] that for
classical groups G over finite fields there are several (compatible) invariants
of representations that provide strong information on the character ratios. We
call these invariants collectively rank. Rank suggests a new way to organize
the representations of classical groups over finite and local fields - a way in
which the building blocks are the ""smallest"" representations. This is in
contrast to Harish-Chandra's philosophy of cusp forms that is the main
organizational principle since the 60s, and in it the building blocks are the
cuspidal representations which are, in some sense, the ""LARGEST"". The
philosophy of cusp forms is well adapted to establishing the Plancherel formula
for reductive groups over local fields, and led to Lusztig's classification of
the irreducible representations of such groups over finite fields. However,
analysis of character ratios might benefit from a different approach. In this
note we discuss further the notion of tensor rank for GL_n over a finite field
F_q and demonstrate how to get information on representations of a given tensor
rank using tools coming from the recently studied eta correspondence, as well
as the well known philosophy of cusp forms, mentioned just above. A significant
discovery so far is that although the dimensions of the irreducible
representations of a given tensor rank vary by quite a lot (they can differ by
large powers of q), for certain group elements of interest the character ratios
of these irreps are nearly equal to each other.

compress the synonymous keywords into one representative, and the corresponding

that with our quotient space-based retrieval method, the synonymous keyword

defect data from the history of projects. If this data is noisy, the resulting
defect prediction model could result to be unreliable. One of the causes of
noise for defect datasets is the presence of ""dormant defects"", i.e., of
defects discovered several releases after their introduction. This can cause a
class to be labeled as defect-free while it is not, and is, therefore
""snoring"". In this paper, we investigate the impact of snoring on classifiers'
accuracy and the effectiveness of a possible countermeasure, i.e., dropping too
recent data from a training set. We analyze the accuracy of 15 machine learning
defect prediction classifiers, on data from more than 4,000 defects and 600

that on average across projects: (i) the presence of dormant defects decreases
the recall of defect prediction classifiers, and (ii) removing from the
training set the classes that in the last release are labeled as not defective
significantly improves the accuracy of the classifiers. In summary, this paper
provides insights on how to create defects datasets by mitigating the negative

algorithm with P1 P1 stabilized finite elements for the fluid problem; for this
alghorithm we prove well-posedness, unconditional stability and convergence in
the case of linearized problem (see Propositions 2.4.2, 2.4.3 and Theorem
3.3.7, respectively). The analysis optimal convergence rates as expected from
the Euler scheme, and the supposed regularity of the solution to the continuous
problem. Moreover we introduce two algorithms that allow for a partitioning of
the coupled problem by exploiting an explicit-implicit treatment of the
transmission conditions. Algorithm 2 represents, essentially, a simplification
of Algorithm 1 since it simply treat the solid elastic forces in explicit form
using the displacement and velocities of the structure evaluated in the
previous time steps. Instead, Algorithm 3, is really a splitting algorithm that
involves the solution of two staggered problems. It splits the forces that
solid transfers to fluid in two contributions: the inertial contribution that
is treated in implicit form and the elastic contribution that is treated in
explicit form. We perform the stability analysis for both the schemes in
Theorems 4.3.1 and 4.3.3. Algorithm 2 results conditionally stable for all the
extrapolations considered, instead Algorithm 3 is unconditionally stable, for
extrapolations of order zero and one, and conditionally stable for the
extrapolation of order two. Since Algorithm 3 is the most promising, we perform
the convergence analysis in the linearized case (see Theorem 4.4.2) obtaining
results in line with those of the monolithic case, in particular the splitting
introduced preserves optimal conevegence rates.

phase between O stars on the main-sequence and the Wolf-Rayet stage. Recent
studies suggest that they might be formed through binary interaction. Only a
few are known in binary systems but their multiplicity fraction is uncertain.
Aims. This study aims at deriving the binary fraction among the Galactic
(confirmed and candidate) LBV population. We combine multi-epoch spectroscopy
and long-baseline interferometry. Methods. We use cross-correlation to measure
their radial velocities. We identify spectroscopic binaries through significant
RV variability (larger than 35 km/s). We investigate the observational biases
to establish the intrinsic binary fraction. We use CANDID to detect
interferometric companions, derive their parameters and positions. Results. We
derive an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of 26 %. Considering period
and mass ratio ranges from Porb=1 to 1000 days, and q = 0.1-1.0, and a
representative set of orbital parameter distributions, we find a bias-corrected
binary fraction of 62%. From interferometry, we detect 14 companions out of 18
objects, providing a binary fraction of 78% at projected separations between 1
and 120 mas. From the derived primary diameters, and the distances of these
objects, we measure for the first time the exact radii of Galactic LBVs to be
between 100 and 650 Rsun, making unlikely to have short-period systems.
Conclusions. This analysis shows that the binary fraction among the Galactic
LBV population is large. If they form through single-star evolution, their
orbit must be initially large. If they form through binary channel that implies
that either massive stars in short binary systems must undergo a phase of fully
non-conservative mass transfer to be able to sufficiently widen the orbit or
that LBVs form through merging in initially binary or triple systems.

concurrently with video recording of the crystal under the microscope, were
followed by R(T) measurements during three slow heating-cooling cycles between

of I-V measurements and video recordings. The results show that the slow
cycling through the transition using external heat had a healing effect on the
reproducibility of R(T) while increasing the activation energy of conduction in
the insulating state and in reducing the damping term in the domains' sliding
velocity. The intriguing result of this set of measurements was that the energy
cost of the domain emission, was higher after healing than prior to it.

spectroscopy of the nebula shows a fast shock with extreme velocities of
approx. 1,100kms. The derived expansion age of the nebula implies an explosive
event approx 1,000 years ago which agrees with the 1181 AD event. The on sky

3.5degrees. Pa 30 and Parkers star have previously been proposed to be the

Complexity and Bitrate Adaptive Network (CBANet), which aims to learn one
single network to support variable bitrate coding under different computational
complexity constraints. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art learning
based image compression frameworks that only consider the rate-distortion
trade-off without introducing any constraint related to the computational
complexity, our CBANet considers the trade-off between the rate and distortion
under dynamic computational complexity constraints. Specifically, to decode the
images with one single decoder under various computational complexity
constraints, we propose a new multi-branch complexity adaptive module, in which
each branch only takes a small portion of the computational budget of the
decoder. The reconstructed images with different visual qualities can be
readily generated by using different numbers of branches. Furthermore, to
achieve variable bitrate decoding with one single decoder, we propose a bitrate
adaptive module to project the representation from a base bitrate to the
expected representation at a target bitrate for transmission. Then it will
project the transmitted representation at the target bitrate back to that at
the base bitrate for the decoding process. The proposed bit adaptive module can
significantly reduce the storage requirement for deployment platforms. As a
result, our CBANet enables one single codec to support multiple bitrate
decoding under various computational complexity constraints. Comprehensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
CBANet for deep image compression.

difference-of-convex (DC) regularization strategy was employed, then the
RCLSSDP is transferred into a series of least squares semidefinite programming
with DC regularization (DCLSSDP). An inexact proximal DC algorithm with sieving
strategy (s-iPDCA) is proposed for solving the DCLSSDP, whose subproblems are
solved by the accelerated block coordinate descent (ABCD) method. Convergence
analysis shows that the generated sequence of s-iPDCA globally converges to
stationary points of the corresponding DC problem. To show the efficiency of
our proposed algorithm for solving the RCLSSDP, the s-iPDCA is compared with

However, methods that saturate these resolution limits, usually require the
full measurement statistics, which can be challenging to access. In this work,
we introduce a simple superresolution protocol to estimate the separation
between two thermal sources which relies only on the average value of a single
accessible observable. We show how optimal observables for this technique may
be constructed for arbitrary thermal sources, and we study their sensitivities
when one has access to spatially resolved intensity measurements (direct
imaging) and photon counting after spatial mode demultiplexing. For
demultiplexing, our method is optimal, i.e. it saturates the quantum
Cram\'er-Rao bound. We also investigate the impact of noise on the optimal
observables, their measurement sensitivity and on the scaling with the number
of detected photons of the smallest resolvable separation. For low signals in
the image plane, we demonstrate that our method saturates the Cram\'er-Rao
bound even in the presence of noise.

back-translation (SignBT) approach, which incorporates massive spoken language

back-translate the monolingual text to its gloss sequence. Then, the paired
sign sequence is generated by splicing pieces from an estimated gloss-to-sign
bank at the feature level. Finally, the synthetic parallel data serves as a
strong supplement for the end-to-end training of the encoder-decoder SLT
framework.
  To promote the SLT research, we further contribute CSL-Daily, a large-scale
continuous SLT dataset. It provides both spoken language translations and
gloss-level annotations. The topic revolves around people's daily lives (e.g.,
travel, shopping, medical care), the most likely SLT application scenario.
Extensive experimental results and analysis of SLT methods are reported on
CSL-Daily. With the proposed sign back-translation method, we obtain a
substantial improvement over previous state-of-the-art SLT methods.

separating the nodes in the spatial domain. In addition, we give an outlook on

Recent unsupervised methods have greatly relaxed the dependency on annotated

further improve the part segmentation performance, we develop a novel approach
by disentangling the appearance and shape representations of object parts

areas, the robustness of graph embedding against adversarial attack inevitably
becomes a crucial problem in graph learning. Existing works usually perform the
attack in a white-box fashion: they need to access the predictions/labels to
construct their adversarial loss. However, the inaccessibility of
predictions/labels makes the white-box attack impractical to a real graph
learning system. This paper promotes current frameworks in a more general and
flexible sense -- we demand to attack various kinds of graph embedding models
with black-box driven. We investigate the theoretical connections between graph
signal processing and graph embedding models and formulate the graph embedding
model as a general graph signal process with a corresponding graph filter.
Therefore, we design a generalized adversarial attacker: GF-Attack. Without
accessing any labels and model predictions, GF-Attack can perform the attack
directly on the graph filter in a black-box fashion. We further prove that
GF-Attack can perform an effective attack without knowing the number of layers
of graph embedding models. To validate the generalization of GF-Attack, we
construct the attacker on four popular graph embedding models. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of GF-Attack on several benchmark
datasets.

charge transport and electronic ground state in a wide variety of different
materials. This is due to its capability to induce large modulations of the
surface charge density by means of the electric-double-layer field-effect
transistor (EDL-FET) architecture, and has been proven to be capable of tuning
even the properties of metallic systems. In this short review, I summarize the
main results which have been achieved so far in controlling the superconducting
(SC) properties of thin films of conventional metallic superconductors by means
of the ionic gating technique. I discuss how the gate-induced charge doping,
despite being confined to a thin surface layer by electrostatic screening,
results in a long-range ""bulk"" modulation of the SC properties by the coherent
nature of the SC condensate, as evidenced by the observation of suppressions in
the critical temperature of films much thicker than the electrostatic screening
length, and by the pronounced thickness-dependence of their magnitude. I review
how this behavior can be modelled in terms of proximity effect between the
charge-doped surface layer and the unperturbed bulk with different degrees of
approximation, and how first-principles calculations have been employed to
determine the origin of an anomalous increase in the electrostatic screening
length at ultrahigh electric fields, thus fully confirming the validity of the
proximity effect model. Finally, I discuss a general framework - based on the
combination of ab-initio Density Functional Theory and the Migdal-Eliashberg
theory of superconductivity - by which the properties of any gated thin film of
a conventional metallic superconductor can be determined purely from first
principles.

robust machine learning models is still an open problem. The most compelling
defence to date is adversarial training and consists of complementing the

impacts training time and depends on finding representative adversarial
samples. In this paper we propose to train models on output spaces with large
class separation in order to gain robustness without adversarial training. We
introduce a method to partition the output space into class prototypes with
large separation and train models to preserve it. Experimental results shows
that models trained with these prototypes -- which we call deep repulsive
prototypes -- gain robustness competitive with adversarial training, while also
preserving more accuracy on natural samples. Moreover, the models are more
resilient to large perturbation sizes. For example, we obtained over 50%
robustness for CIFAR-10, with 92% accuracy on natural samples and over 20%
robustness for CIFAR-100, with 71% accuracy on natural samples without
adversarial training. For both data sets, the models preserved robustness

examination for screening thoracic diseases. According to the domain knowledge
of screening chest X-rays, the pathological information usually lay on the lung
and heart regions. However, it is costly to acquire region-level annotation in
practice, and model training mainly relies on image-level class labels in a
weakly supervised manner, which is highly challenging for computer-aided chest
X-ray screening. To address this issue, some methods have been proposed
recently to identify local regions containing pathological information, which
is vital for thoracic disease classification. Inspired by this, we propose a
novel deep learning framework to explore discriminative information from lung
and heart regions. We design a feature extractor equipped with a multi-scale
attention module to learn global attention maps from global images. To exploit
disease-specific cues effectively, we locate lung and heart regions containing
pathological information by a well-trained pixel-wise segmentation model to
generate binarization masks. By introducing element-wise logical AND operator
on the learned global attention maps and the binarization masks, we obtain
local attention maps in which pixels are $1$ for lung and heart region and $0$
for other regions. By zeroing features of non-lung and heart regions in
attention maps, we can effectively exploit their disease-specific cues in lung
and heart regions. Compared to existing methods fusing global and local
features, we adopt feature weighting to avoid weakening visual cues unique to
lung and heart regions. Evaluated by the benchmark split on the publicly
available chest X-ray14 dataset, the comprehensive experiments show that our
method achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

model that describes the social distancing behaviors during an epidemic,
assuming a continuum of players and individual infection dynamics. The
evolution of the players' infection states follows a variant of the well-known
SIR dynamics. We assume that the players are not sure about their infection
state, and thus they choose their actions based on their individually perceived
probabilities of being susceptible, infected or removed. The cost of each
player depends both on her infection state and on the contact with others. We
prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium and characterize Nash equilibria
using nonlinear complementarity problems. We then exploit some monotonicity
properties of the optimal policies to obtain a reduced-order characterization
for Nash equilibrium and reduce its computation to the solution of a
low-dimensional optimization problem. It turns out that, even in the symmetric
case, where all the players have the same parameters, players may have very
different behaviors. We finally present some numerical studies that illustrate
this interesting phenomenon and investigate the effects of several parameters,
including the players' vulnerability, the time horizon, and the maximum allowed
actions, on the optimal policies and the players' costs.

compare these estimators by their error in pairwise prediction (which
generation system is better?) using the bootstrap. Measuring this error is
complicated: predictions are evaluated against noisy, human predicted labels
instead of the ground truth, and metric predictions fluctuate based on the test

we adjust this error to a noise-free, infinite test set setting. Our analysis
compares the adjusted error of metrics to humans and a derived, perfect

outperform humans due to a statistical advantage in variance: when the number

First, we induced a theoretical model from thirteen exploratory field studies.
Our model proposes that the effectiveness of Scrum teams depends on five
high-level factors - responsiveness, stakeholder concern, continuous
improvement, team autonomy, and management support - and thirteen lower-level
factors. In the second phase of our study, we validated our model with a
Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis using data from
about 5,000 developers and 2,000 Scrum teams that we gathered with a
custom-built survey. Results suggest a very good fit of the empirical data in
our theoretical model (CFI = 0.959, RMSEA = 0.038, SRMR = 0.035). Accordingly,
this research allowed us to (1) propose and validate a generalizable theory for
effective Scrum teams and (2) formulate clear recommendations for how
organizations can better support Scrum teams.

abruptly (flash effect), the transient transmission signal is reinforced by
cooperativity, showing enhanced sensitivity to the two-photon frequency
detuning. If the probe laser is periodically switched on and off, the amplitude
of the transmission signal varies and remains large even for high modulation
frequency. This technique has potential applications in sensing, such as
magnetometry and velocimetry, and in coherent population trapping clocks.

into account Stokes phenomena of WKB solutions, we obtain wavefunctions that
systematically include the repetitive dynamics of production and acceleration
of electron-hole pairs and quantum interference due to phase accumulation
between different pair production times (St\""{u}ckelberg phase). Using the
obtained wavefunctions without relying on any phenomenological assumptions, we
explicitly compute electric current (including intra- and inter-band
contributions) as the source of HHG for a massive Dirac system in
(1+1)-dimensions under an ac electric field. We demonstrate that the WKB
approximation agrees well with numerical results obtained by solving the
time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation and point out that the quantum
interference is important in HHG. We also predict in the deep nonperturbative
regime that (1) harmonic intensities oscillate with respect to electric-field
amplitude $E_0$ and frequency $\Omega$, with a period determined by the
St\""{u}ckelberg phase; (2) the cutoff order of HHG is determined by
$2eE_0/\hbar \Omega^2$, with $e$ being the electron charge; and that (3)
non-integer harmonics, controlled by the St\""{u}ckelberg phase, appear as a
transient effect. Our WKB theory is particularly suited for a parameter regime,
where the Keldysh parameter $\gamma=(\Delta/2)\Omega/eE_0$, with $\Delta$ being
the gap size, is small. This parameter regime corresponds to intense lasers in
the terahertz regime for realistic massive Dirac materials. Our analysis
implies that the so-called HHG plateau can be observed at the terahertz
frequency within the current technology.

Natural Language Processing, with surprising connections to human meaning

capable of producing contextual word representations that reliably convey
sense-specific information, simply as a product of self-supervision. Prior work
has shown that these contextual representations can be used to accurately
represent large sense inventories as sense embeddings, to the extent that a

In this work we introduce a more principled approach to leverage information

also emphasize the versatility of these sense embeddings in contrast to
task-specific models, applying them on several sense-related tasks, besides
WSD, while demonstrating improved performance using our proposed approach over
prior work focused on sense embeddings. Finally, we discuss unexpected findings
regarding layer and model performance variations, and potential applications

others that form the basic structural component of a signed network. These
signed networks picture a dynamic characteristic of the graph so formed
allowing only few combinations of signs that brings the structural balance
theorem in picture. Structural balance theory affirms that signed social
networks tend to be organized so as to avoid conflictual situations,
corresponding to cycles of unstable relations. The aim of structural balance in
networks is to find proper partitions of nodes that guarantee equilibrium in
the system allowing only few combination triangles with signed edges to be
permitted in graph. Most of the works in this field of networking have either
explained the importance of signed graph or have applied the balance theorem
and tried to solve problems. Following the recent time trends with each nation
emerging to be superior and competing to be the best, the probable doubt of
happening of WW-III(World War-III) comes into every individuals mind.
Nevertheless, our paper aims at answering some of the interesting questions on
World War-III. In this project we have worked with the creation of a signed
graph picturing the World War-III participating countries as nodes and have
predicted the best possible coalition of countries that will be formed during
war. Also, we have visually depicted the number of communities that will be
formed in this war and the participating countries in each communities.

the ""low"" Fermi energy effect, and the other is the ""strong"" impurity effect.

elucidate their observed variability and the underlying physical mechanisms.
Indeed, global oscillations and bending modes of accretion discs or tori may be
relevant to quasi-periodicity and warped structures around compact objects.
While most studies rely on linear theory, observationally significant,
nonlinear dynamics is still poorly understood, especially in Keplerian discs
for which resonances typically demand a separate treatment. In this work we
introduce a novel analytical model which exactly solves the ideal, compressible
fluid equations for a non-self-gravitating elliptical cylinder within a local
shearing sheet. The aspect ratio of the ring is an adjustable parameter,
allowing a continuum of models ranging from a torus of circular cross-section
to a thin ring. We restrict attention to flow fields which are a linear
function of the coordinates, capturing the lowest order global motions and
reducing the dynamics to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations
(ODEs). This system acts as a framework for exploring a rich range of
hydrodynamic phenomena in both the large amplitude and Keplerian regimes. We
demonstrate the connection between tilting tori and warped discs within this
model, showing that the linear modes of the ring correspond to oppositely
precessing global bending modes. These are further confirmed within a numerical
grid based simulation. Crucially, the ODE system developed here allows for a
more tractable investigation of nonlinear dynamics. This will be demonstrated
in a subsequent paper which evidences mode coupling between warping and
vertical motions in thin tilted rings.

if in the presence of battery's local Hamiltonian. Then we demonstrate for a
non-unitary charging protocol, the indefinite causal order version charger
yields a charged battery with higher energy over its classical counterpart
under any conditions. We also have a finding that runs counter to our intuition
which, roughly speaking, has the implication that a relatively less powerful
charger guarantees a charged battery with higher energy. Finally, to reduce the
cost imposed by a measurement-based protection scheme, indefinite causal order
shows its potential to fulfill this goal.

nodes, as a group, maximize a non-parametric measure of divergence away from
the expected distribution of activations created from real data. This enable us
to identify synthesised images without prior knowledge of their distribution.
SubsetGAN efficiently scores subsets of nodes and returns the group of nodes
within the pre-trained classifier that contributed to the maximum score. The
classifier can be a general fake classifier trained over samples from multiple
sources or the discriminator network from different GANs. Our approach shows
consistently higher detection power than existing detection methods across
several state-of-the-art GANs (PGGAN, StarGAN, and CycleGAN) and over different
proportions of generated content.

still remain difficult to reproduce. We have developed a versatile radiative
code, based on a time-dependent treatment of particle acceleration, escape and
radiative cooling, allowing us to test different scenarios to connect the
continuous low-state emission self-consistently with that during flaring
states. We consider flares as weak perturbations of the quiescent state and
apply this description to the February 2010 MWL flare of Mrk 421, the brightest
Very High Energy (VHE) flare ever detected from this archetypal blazar,
focusing on interpretations with a minimum number of free parameters. A general
criterion is obtained, which disfavours a one-zone model connecting low and
high state under our assumptions. A two-zone model combining physically
connected acceleration and emission regions yields a satisfactory
interpretation of the available time-dependent MWL light curves and spectra of
Mrk 421, although certain details remain difficult to reproduce. The two-zone
scenario finally proposed for the complex quiescent and flaring VHE emitting
region involves both Fermi-I and Fermi-II acceleration mechanisms, respectively
at the origin of the quiescent and flaring emission.

dramatic reduction in efficiency as the system being studied is driven towards
a critical point. Recently, a series of seminal studies suggested that
normalizing flows - a class of deep generative models - can form the basis of a
sampling strategy that does not suffer from this 'critical slowing down'. The
central idea is to use machine learning techniques to build (approximate)
trivializing maps, i.e. field transformations that map the theory of interest
into a 'simpler' theory in which the degrees of freedom decouple, and where the
statistical weight in the path integral is given by a distribution from which
sampling is easy. No separate process is required to generate training data for
such models, and convergence to the desired distribution is guaranteed through
a reweighting procedure such as a Metropolis test. In a proof-of-principle
demonstration on two-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory, Albergo et al.
(arXiv:1904.12072) modelled the trivializing map as a sequence of pointwise
affine transformations. We pick up this thread, with the aim of quantifying how
well we can expect this approach to scale as we increase the number of degrees
of freedom in the system. We make several modifications to the original design
that allow our models learn more efficient representations of trivializing maps
using much smaller neural networks, which leads to a large reduction in the
computational cost required to train models of equivalent quality. After making
these changes, we find that sampling efficiency is almost entirely dictated by
how extensively a model has been trained, while being unresponsive to further
alterations that increase model flexibility. However, as we move towards the
continuum limit the training costs scale extremely quickly, which urgently
requires further work to fully understand and mitigate.

with a median stellar mass of $10^{9.1}$ M$_{\odot}$, from the MUSE Hubble

H-band magnitude, the galaxies show an average EW $\approx 20$ angstrom, below
the typical selection threshold for Lyman Alpha Emitters (EW $> 25$ angstrom),
and a rest-frame UV spectrum similar to Lyman Break Galaxies. We use rest-frame
optical spectroscopy from KMOS and MOSFIRE, and the UV features observed with
MUSE, to determine the systemic redshifts, which are offset from Lyman alpha by
346 km s$^{-1}$, with a 100 to 600 km s$^{-1}$ range. Stacking CO(4-3) and
[CI](1-0) (and higher-$J$ CO lines) from the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey of the
HUDF (ASPECS), we determine $3\sigma$ upper limits on the line luminosities of
$4.0\times10^{8}$ K km s$^{-1}$pc$^{2}$ and $5.6\times10^{8}$ K km
s$^{-1}$pc$^{2}$, respectively (for a 300 km s$^{-1}$ linewidth). Stacking the
1.2 mm and 3 mm dust continuum flux densities, we find a $3\sigma$ upper limits
of 9 $\mu$Jy and $1.2$ $\mu$Jy, respectively. The inferred gas fractions, under
the assumption of a 'Galactic' CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor and gas-to-dust
ratio, are in tension with previously determined scaling relations. This
implies a substantially higher $\alpha_{\rm CO} \ge 10$ and $\delta_{\rm GDR}
\ge 1200$, consistent with the sub-solar metallicity estimated for these
galaxies ($12 + \log(O/H) \approx 7.8 \pm 0.2$). The low metallicity of $z \ge
3$ star-forming galaxies may thus make it very challenging to unveil their cold
gas through CO or dust emission, warranting further exploration of alternative
tracers, such as [CII].

this range, two competing mechanisms can efficiently produce gamma rays: the
inverse Compton scattering of accelerated electrons, and interactions of
accelerated protons with nuclei of the ISM. In addition to the acceleration of
particles from the thermal pool, the reacceleration of pre-existing CRs is
often overlooked, and shall in fact also been taken into account. Especially,
because of the distance to the SNR ($\sim 1$ kpc), and the low density in which
the shock is currently expanding ($\sim 10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$), the
re-acceleration of CR electrons pre-existing in the ISM, can account for a
significant fraction of the observed gamma-ray emission, and contribute to the
shaping of the spectrum in the GeV-TeV range. Remarkably, this emission of
leptonic origin is found to be close to the level of the gamma-ray signal in
the TeV range, provided that the spectrum of pre-exisiting cosmic ray electrons
is similar to the one observed in the local interstellar medium. The overall
gamma-ray spectrum of RX J1713.7-3946 is naturally produced as the sum of a
leptonic emission from reaccelerated CR electrons, and a subdominant hadronic
emission from accelerated protons. We also argue that neutrino observations

lepto-hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission.

multi-stranded loop model to better approximate the numerically challenging
transition region, this paper examines synthetic NASA Solar Dynamics
Observatory's (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) emission simulated in
response to a series of prescribed spatially and temporally random, impulsive
and localised heating events across numerous sub-loop elements with a strong
weighting towards the base of the structure; the nanoflare heating scenario.
The total number of strands and nanoflare repetition times are varied
systematically in such a way that the total energy content remains
approximately constant across all the cases analysed. Repeated time lag
detection during an emission time series provides a good approximation for the
nanoflare repetition time for low-frequency heating. Furthermore, using a
combination of AIA 171/193 and 193/211 channel ratios in combination with
spectroscopic determination of the standard deviation of the loop apex
temperature over several hours alongside simulations from the outlined
multi-stranded loop model, it is demonstrated that both the imposed heating
rate and number of strands can be realised.

smart cities. In particular, on-demand ridesharing services, which group
together passengers with similar itineraries, are already operating in several
metropolitan areas. These services can be of significant social and
environmental benefit, by reducing travel costs, road congestion and CO2
emissions.
  Unfortunately, despite their advantages, not many people opt to use these
ridesharing services. We believe that increasing the user satisfaction from the
service will cause more people to utilize it, which, in turn, will improve the
quality of the service, such as the waiting time, cost, travel time, and
service availability. One possible way for increasing user satisfaction is by
providing appropriate explanations comparing the alternative modes of
transportation, such as a private taxi ride and public transportation. For
example, a passenger may be more satisfied from a shared-ride if she is told
that a private taxi ride would have cost her 50% more. Therefore, the problem
is to develop an agent that provides explanations that will increase the user
satisfaction.
  We model our environment as a signaling game and show that a rational agent,
which follows the perfect Bayesian equilibrium, must reveal all of the
information regarding the possible alternatives to the passenger. In addition,
we develop a machine learning based agent that, when given a shared-ride along
with its possible alternatives, selects the explanations that are most likely
to increase user satisfaction. Using feedback from humans we show that our
machine learning based agent outperforms the rational agent and an agent that
randomly chooses explanations, in terms of user satisfaction.

compensating class imbalance for deep-learning based automatic detection of

background and target calls. Such imbalances can have negative effects on
classifier performances. We employed a state-of-the-art detection approach
based on convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). We extended the
detection pipeline through various stages for compensating class imbalance.
These included (1) spectrogram denoising, (2) alternative loss functions, and
(3) resampling. Our key findings are: (1) spectrogram denoising operations
significantly improved performance for both target classes, (2) standard binary
cross entropy reached the highest performance, and (3) manipulating relative
class imbalance through resampling either decreased or maintained performance
depending on the target class. Finally, we reached detection performances of
33% for drumming and 5% for vocalization, which is a >7 fold increase compared

of high-lift configurations pose substantial difficulties to current turbulence
models. In this paper, a three-equation k-(v^2)-{\omega} turbulence model for
the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations is used to compute the stall
behavior of high-lift configurations. A separated shear layer fixed function is
implemented in the turbulence model to better capture the nonequilibrium
characteristics of turbulence. Different high-lift configurations, including
the two-dimensional multielement NLR7301 and Omar airfoils and a complex
full-configuration model (JAXA Standard Model), are numerically tested. The
results indicate that the effect of the nonequilibrium characteristics of
turbulence is significant in the free shear layer, which is key to accurately
predicting the stall behavior of high-lift devices. The modified SPF k-(v^2

Spalart-Allmaras, shear stress transport, and original k-(v^2)-{\omega} models

only a few benchmarks. As benchmarks are crucial for the fair comparison of
algorithms, ensuring their quality is tantamount to providing a solid ground
for developing better solutions to link prediction and ipso facto embedding
knowledge graphs. First studies of benchmarks pointed to limitations pertaining
to information leaking from the development to the test fragments of some
benchmark datasets. We spotted a further common limitation of three of the
benchmarks commonly used for evaluating link prediction approaches:
out-of-vocabulary entities in the test and validation sets. We provide an

use an unbounded color palette and aim to use the smallest colors and,
consequently, the smallest number of colors.
  We identify classes of bipartite graphs where reoptimization is as hard as or
even harder than optimization from scratch, i.e., starting with a random
initialization. Even adding a single edge can lead to hard symmetry problems.
However, graph classes that are hard for one algorithm turn out to be easy for
others. In most cases our bounds show that reoptimization is faster than
optimizing from scratch. We further show that tailoring mutation operators to
parts of the graph where changes have occurred can significantly reduce the
expected reoptimization time. In most settings the expected reoptimization time
for such tailored algorithms is linear in the number of added edges. However,
tailored algorithms cannot prevent exponential times in settings where the

A
possible way is via the Coulomb interaction, which then defines the Mott

disorder, the so-called Anderson MIT. Here we analyze interacting particles in
disordered Hubbard chains $-$ thus comprising the Mott-Anderson physics $-$ by
investigating the ground-state entanglement with density functional theory. The
localization signature on entanglement is found to be a local minimum at a
certain critical density. Individually, the Mott (Anderson) MIT has a single
critical density whose minimum entanglement decreases as the interaction
(disorder) enhances. While in the Mott MIT entanglement saturates at finite
values, characterizing partial localization, in the Anderson MIT the system
reaches full localization, with zero entanglement, for sufficiently strong
disorder. In the combined Mott-Anderson MIT, we find three critical densities
referring to local minima on entanglement. One of them is the same as for the
Anderson MIT, but now the presence of interaction requires a stronger disorder
potential to induce localization. A second critical density is related to the
Mott MIT, but due to disorder it is displaced by a factor proportional to the
concentration of impurities. The third local minimum on entanglement is unique
to the concomitant presence of disorder and interaction, found to be related to
an effective density phenomenon, thus referred to as a Mott-like MIT. Since
entanglement has been intrinsically connected to the magnetic susceptibility
$-$ a quantity promptly available in cold atoms experiments $-$ our detailed
numerical description might be useful for the experimental investigation of

expression of sentiment in deceptive language. The results of this work show
that the automatic deception detection across cultures and languages cannot be

sheet music query, and vice versa, working directly with audio and scanned
sheet music images. The fundamental approach to this is to learn a cross-modal
embedding space with a suitable similarity structure for audio and sheet image
snippets, using a deep neural network, and identifying candidate pieces by
cross-modal near neighbour search in this space. However, this method is
oblivious of temporal aspects of music. In this paper, we introduce two
strategies that address this shortcoming. First, we present a strategy that
aligns sequences of embeddings learned from sheet music scans and audio
snippets. A series of experiments on whole piece and fragment-level retrieval
on 24 hours worth of classical piano recordings demonstrates significant
improvement. Second, we show that the retrieval can be further improved by
introducing an attention mechanism to the embedding learning model that reduces
the effects of tempo variations in music. To conclude, we assess the
scalability of our method and discuss potential measures to make it suitable
for truly large-scale applications.

(ICF), making the collective stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) with shared
ion acoustic wave (IAW) potentially important because of the effectively larger
laser intensities to drive the instability. In this work, based on a linear
kinetic model, an exact analytic solution for the convective amplification of
SBS with the shared IAW modes stimulated by two overlapped beams is presented.
From this solution, effects of the wavelength difference, crossing angle,
polarization states, and finite beam overlapping volume of the two laser beams
on the shared IAW modes are studied. It is found that a wavelength difference
of several nanometers between the laser beams has negligible effects, except
for a very small crossing angle about one degree. However, the crossing angle,
beam polarization states, and finite beam overlapping volume can have
significant influences on the shared IAW modes. Furthermore, the out-of-plane
modes, in which the wavevectors of daughter waves lie in the different planes
from the two overlapped beams, are found to be important for certain
polarization states and crossing angles of the laser beams with the finite beam
overlapping volume. This work is helpful to comprehend and estimate the
collective SBS with shared IAW in ICF experiments.

observational constraints (XUV and bolometric luminosity) from multi-epoch
X-ray/UV photometry. Following the formalism presented in Fleming et al.

3.14_{-1.46}^{+2.22}$ Gyr. After the saturation phase, we find L$_{\rm XUV}$
decayed over time by an exponential rate of $\beta_{\rm XUV} =
-1.17_{-0.28}^{+0.27}$. Compared to our inferred age of the system, ${\rm age}
= 7.96_{-1.87}^{+1.78}$ Gyr, our result for $t_{sat}$ suggests that there is
only a $\sim4\%$~chance that TRAPPIST-1 still remains in the saturated phase
today, which is significantly lower than the previous estimate of 40\%. Despite
this reduction in $t_{sat}$, our results remain consistent in the conclusion
that the TRAPPIST-1 planets likely received an extreme amount XUV energy -- an
estimated integrated XUV energy of $\sim10^{30}-10^{32}$ erg over the star's
lifetime.

(noisy intermediate-scale quantum) devices, and fault-tolerant quantum
computation. Characterizing these errors is important for improving the
performance of these devices, via calibration and error correction, and to
ensure correct interpretation of the results. We propose a compressed sensing
method for detecting two-qubit correlated dephasing errors, assuming only that
the correlations are sparse (i.e., at most s pairs of qubits have correlated
errors, where s << n(n-1)/2, and n is the total number of qubits). In
particular, our method can detect long-range correlations between any two
qubits in the system (i.e., the correlations are not restricted to be
geometrically local).
  Our method is highly scalable: it requires as few as m = O(s log n)
measurement settings, and efficient classical postprocessing based on convex
optimization. In addition, when m = O(s log^4(n)), our method is highly robust
to noise, and has sample complexity O(max(n,s)^2 log^4(n)), which can be
compared to conventional methods that have sample complexity O(n^3). Thus, our
method is advantageous when the correlations are sufficiently sparse, that is,
when s < O(n^(3/2) / log^2(n)). Our method also performs well in numerical
simulations on small system sizes, and has some resistance to
state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors. The key ingredient in our
method is a new type of compressed sensing measurement, which works by
preparing entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states (GHZ states) on random
subsets of qubits, and measuring their decay rates with high precision.

which utilizes quantum physical photonic features; and the
Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) system that is based on classical
statistical physics (fluctuation-dissipation theorem). The focus topic of this
paper is the thermodynamical situation of the KLJN system. In all the original
works, the proposed KLJN schemes required thermal equilibrium between the
devices of the communicating parties to achieve perfect security. However,
Vadai, et al, in (Nature) Science Reports 5 (2015) 13653 shows a modified
scheme, where there is a non-zero thermal noise energy flow between the
parties, yet the system seems to resist all the known attack types. We
introduce a new attack type against their system. The new attack utilizes
coincidence events between the line current and voltages. We show that there is
non-zero information leak toward the Eavesdropper, even under idealized
conditions. As soon as the thermal equilibrium is restored, the system becomes
perfectly secure again. In conclusion, perfect unconditional security requires
thermal equilibrium.

distribution asymptotically. In high-dimensional settings with multiple
relevant metastable basins, local approaches require either immense
computational effort or intricately designed importance sampling strategies to

nonlocal transition kernels parameterized with generative models known as
normalizing flows. We focus on a setting where there is no preexisting data, as
is commonly the case for problems in which MCMC is used. Our method uses: (i) a
MCMC strategy that blends local moves obtained from any standard transition

the data generated this way to adapt the generative model and improve its

contrast to the previously used approximation where the basis-set correction
density functional was a posteriori added to the energy from a wave-function
calculation, here the energy minimization is performed including the basis-set
correction. Compared to the non-self-consistent approximation, this allows one
to lower the total energy and change the wave function under the effect of the
basis-set correction. This work addresses two main questions: i) What is the
change in total energy compared to the non-self-consistent approximation, and
ii) can we obtain better properties, namely dipole moments, with the basis-set
corrected wave functions? We implement the present formalism with two different
basis-set correction functionals and test it on different molecular systems.
The main results of the study are that i) the total energy lowering obtained by
the self-consistent approach is extremely small, which justifies the use of the
non-self-consistent approximation, and ii) the dipole moments obtained from the
basis-set corrected wave functions are improved, being already close to their
complete-basis-set values with triple-zeta basis sets. Thus, the present study
further confirms the soundness of the density-based basis-set correction

this work puts forth a novel framework for learning dynamics after small-signal
disturbances by leveraging Gaussian processes (GPs). We extend results on
learning of a linear time-invariant system using GPs to the multi-input
multi-output setup. This is accomplished by decomposing power system swing
dynamics into a set of single-input single-output linear systems with narrow
frequency pass bands. The proposed learning technique captures time derivatives
in continuous time, accommodates data streams sampled at different rates, and
can cope with missing data and heterogeneous levels of accuracy. While Kalman
filter-based approaches require knowing all system inputs, the proposed
framework handles readings of system inputs, outputs, their derivatives, and
combinations thereof collected from an arbitrary subset of buses. Relying on
minimal system information, it further provides uncertainty quantification in
addition to point estimates of system dynamics. Numerical tests verify that
this technique can infer dynamics at non-metered buses, impute and predict
synchrophasors, and locate faults under linear and non-linear system models
under ambient and fault disturbances.

of the level sets of solutions of monostable reaction-diusion equations, with
respect to the traveling front with minimal speed. On the one hand, it is a
celebrated result of Bramson that such a logarithmic drift occurs when the
reaction is of the KPP (or sublinear) type. On the other hand, it is also known
that this drift phenomenon disappears when the minimal front speed is
nonlinearly determined. However, some monostable reaction-diusion equations
fall in neither of those cases and our aim is to fill that gap. We prove that a
logarithmic drift always occurs when the speed is linearly determined, but
surprisingly we find that the factor in front of the logarithmic term may be
different from the KPP case.

has explored the muon pair production close to its kinematic threshold by
annihilating 45 GeV positrons with electrons in a low Z material target. In
this configuration, muons are emerging from the target with a naturally
low-emittance. In this paper we describe the performance of a system, to study
this production mechanism, that consists in several segmented absorbers with
alternating active layers composed of fast Cherenkov detectors together with a
muon identification technique based on this detector. Passive layers were made
of tungsten. We collected data corresponding to muon and electron beams

previously for the proofs of (stationary) black hole uniqueness results, we
construct a positive-definite energy functional for these perturbations and
establish its conservation for a class of (coupled, gravitational and

utilizes the familiar (Hamiltonian) reduction of the field equations (for
axisymmetric geometries) to a system of wave map fields coupled to a
2+1-dimensional Lorentzian metric on the relevant quotient 3-manifold. The
propagating `dynamical degrees of freedom' of this system are entirely captured
by the wave map fields, which take their values in a four dimensional,
negatively curved (complex hyperbolic) Riemannian target space whereas the
base-space Lorentzian metric is entirely determined, in our setup, by elliptic

likely irradiated by intense H$_2$-photodissociating radiation from nearby
star-forming galaxies and heat the interior gas by successive mergers. The
kinetic energy of the gas originating from mergers as well as baryonic
streaming motion prevents gas collapse and delays prior star formation. With a
streaming velocity higher than the root-mean-square value, gas clouds in nearly
all $10^4$ realizations of merger trees enter the atomic-cooling stage and
begin to collapse isothermally with $T \simeq 8000 K$ via Ly$\alpha$ cooling.
The fraction of trees which host isothermal gas collapse is $14\%$ and
increases with streaming velocity, while the rest form H$_2$-cooled cores after
short isothermal phases. If the collapsing gas is enriched to $Z_{crit}\sim
2\times 10^{-3} Z_\odot$, requiring efficient metal mixing, this fraction could
be reduced by additional cooling via metal fine-structure lines. In the massive
collapsing gas, the accretion rate onto a newly-born protostar ranges between
$3 \times 10^{-3}-5 M_\odot yr^{-1}$, among which a large fraction exceeds the
critical rate suppressing stellar radiative feedback. As a result, we expect a

success in the areas of uncertainty estimation and robustness. However, a
crucial challenge prohibits their use in practice. BNNs require a large number
of predictions to produce reliable results, leading to a significant increase
in computational cost. To alleviate this issue, we propose spatial smoothing, a
method that spatially ensembles neighboring feature map points of convolutional
neural networks. By simply adding a few blur layers to the models, we
empirically show that spatial smoothing improves accuracy, uncertainty
estimation, and robustness of BNNs across a whole range of ensemble sizes. In
particular, BNNs incorporating spatial smoothing achieve high predictive
performance merely with a handful of ensembles. Moreover, this method also can
be applied to canonical deterministic neural networks to improve the
performances. A number of evidences suggest that the improvements can be
attributed to the stabilized feature maps and the smoothing of the loss
landscape. In addition, we provide a fundamental explanation for prior works -
namely, global average pooling, pre-activation, and ReLU6 - by addressing them
as special cases of spatial smoothing. These not only enhance accuracy, but
also improve uncertainty estimation and robustness by making the loss landscape
smoother in the same manner as spatial smoothing. The code is available at

slightly depending on the purifier configuration. The aerosol decay rate was in

reduction in steady-state concentrations resulting from air purifiers was less

related to the conductance saturation occurred when the molarity of AES is very

execute the same benchmark set and data collection is synchronised using

processed by the Robust Energy and Power Predictor Selection (REPPS) software

to an increase in their compressibility and hydraulic conductivity and hence
significant reduction of soil strength. The prediction of desiccation cracking
in soils is challenging due to the lack of insights into the complex coupled
hydro-mechanical process at the grain scale. In this paper, a new hybrid
discrete-continuum numerical framework, capable of capturing hydro-mechanical
behaviour of soil at both grain and macro scales, is proposed for predicting
desiccation cracking in clayey soil. In this framework, a soil layer is
represented by an assembly of DEM particles, each occupies an equivalent
continuum space and carries physical properties governing unsaturated flow.
These particles move freely in the computational space following the discrete
element method (DEM), while their contact network and the continuum mixture
theory are used to model the unsaturated flow. The dependence of
particle-to-particle contact behaviour on water content is represented by a
cohesive-frictional contact model, whose material properties are governed by
the water content. In parallel with the theoretical development is a series of
experiments on 3D soil desiccation cracking to determine essential properties
and provide data for the validation of mechanical and physical behaviour. Very
good agreement in both physical behaviour (e.g. evolution of water content) and
mechanical behaviour (e.g. occurrence and development of cracks, and
distribution of compressive and tensile strains) demonstrates that the proposed
framework is capable of capturing the hydro-mechanical behaviour of soil during
desiccation. The capability of the proposed framework facilitates numerical
experiments for insights into the hydro-mechanical behaviour of unsaturated
soils that have not been possible before.

  inositol triphosphate noise","26 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Epilepsy is a neurological disorder with recurrent seizures of complexity and
randomness. Until now, the mechanism of epileptic randomness has not been fully
elucidated. Inspired by the recent finding that astrocyte GTPase-activating
protein (G-protein)-coupled receptors could be involved in stochastic epileptic
seizures, we proposed a neuron-astrocyte network model, incorporating the noise
of the astrocytic second messager, inositol triphosphate (IP3) which is
modulated by the G-protein)-coupled receptor activation. Based on this model,
we have statistically analysed the transitions of epileptic seizures by
performing tens of simulation trials. Our simulation results show that the
increase of the IP3 noise intensity induces the depolarization-block epileptic
seizures together with an increase in neuronal firing frequency. Meanwhile, a
bistable state of neuronal firing emerges under certain noise intensity, during
which the neuronal firing pattern switches between regular sparse spiking and
epileptic seizure states. This random presence of epileptic seizures is absent
when the noise intensity continues to increase, accompanying with an increase
in the epileptic depolarization block duration. The simulation results also
shed light on the fact that calcium signals in astrocytes play significant
roles in the pattern formations of the epileptic seizure. Our results provide a
potential pathway for understanding the epileptic randomness.

  by Analyzing the Impact of Tweet Text and User Features for Retweet
  Prediction",,,,,"cs.SI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  COVID-19 has affected the world economy and the daily life routine of almost
everyone. It has been a hot topic on social media platforms such as Twitter,
Facebook, etc. These social media platforms enable users to share information
with other users who can reshare this information, thus causing this
information to spread. Twitter's retweet functionality allows users to share
the existing content with other users without altering the original content.
Analysis of social media platforms can help in detecting emergencies during
pandemics that lead to taking preventive measures. One such type of analysis is
predicting the number of retweets for a given COVID-19 related tweet. Recently,
CIKM organized a retweet prediction challenge for COVID-19 tweets focusing on
using numeric features only. However, our hypothesis is, tweet text may play a
vital role in an accurate retweet prediction. In this paper, we combine numeric
and text features for COVID-19 related retweet predictions. For this purpose,
we propose two CNN and RNN based models and evaluate the performance of these
models on a publicly available TweetsCOV19 dataset using seven different
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation results show that combining tweet text with
numeric features improves the performance of retweet prediction significantly.

nonassociative star product. However, it has been shown that this problem can
be avoided by adding to the spacetime coordinates new tensorial degrees of
freedom. The model so obtained, called extended Snyder model, can be subject to
a $\kappa$-deformation, giving rise to a unification of the Snyder and the
$\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebras in the formalism of extended spacetime. In this
paper we review this construction and consider the generic realizations of the
$\kappa$-deformed extended Snyder model, calculating the associated star
product, coproduct and twist in a perturbative setting. We also introduce a
representation of the Lorentz algebra in the extended space and speculate on
possible interpretations of the tensorial degrees of freedom.

computationally expensive by design. While, over the years, many techniques
have been developed to mitigate this issue, data vectorization, in particular,
is arguably still the most attractive strategy due to the parallel nature of
GP. In this work, we employ a series of benchmarks meant to compare both the
performance and evolution capabilities of different vectorized and iterative
implementation approaches across several existing frameworks. Namely, TensorGP,
a novel open-source engine written in Python, is shown to greatly benefit from
the TensorFlow library to accelerate the domain evaluation phase in GP. The
presented performance benchmarks demonstrate that the TensorGP engine manages
to pull ahead, with relative speedups above two orders of magnitude for
problems with a higher number of fitness cases. Additionally, as a consequence
of being able to compute larger domains, we argue that TensorGP performance
gains aid the discovery of more accurate candidate solutions.

  steam turbine exergy efficiency and destruction","25 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.CY cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper presents an exergy analysis of the whole turbine, turbine
cylinders and cylinder parts in four different operating regimes. Analyzed
turbine operates in nuclear power plant while three of four operating regimes
are obtained by using optimization algorithms - SA (Simplex Algorithm), GA
(Genetic Algorithm) and IGSA (Improved Genetic-Simplex Algorithm). IGSA
operating regime gives the highest developed mechanical power of the whole
turbine equal to 1022.48 MW, followed by GA (1020.06 MW) and SA (1017.16 MW),
while in Original operating regime whole turbine develop mechanical power equal
to 996.29 MW. In addition, IGSA causes the highest increase in developed
mechanical power of almost all cylinders and cylinder parts in comparison to
the Original operating regime. All observed optimization algorithms increases
the exergy destruction of the whole turbine in comparison to Original operating
regime - the lowest increase causes IGSA, followed by GA and finally SA. The
highest exergy efficiency of the whole turbine, equal to 85.92% is obtained by
IGSA, followed by GA (85.89%) and SA (85.82%), while the lowest exergy
efficiency is obtained in Original operating regime (85.70%). Analyzed turbine,
which operates by using wet steam is low influenced by the ambient temperature
change. IGSA, which shows dominant performance in exergy analysis parameters of
the analyzed turbine, in certain situations is overpowered by GA. Therefore, in
optimization of steam turbine performance, IGSA and GA can be recommended.
