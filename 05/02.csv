Hilbert-space formulation of classical mechanics in the context of
Vlasov-Maxwell kinetic theory. The celebrated Koopman-von Neumann construction
is provided with two different Hamiltonian structures: one is canonical and
recovers the usual Clebsch representation of the Vlasov density, the other is
noncanonical and appears to overcome certain issues emerging in the canonical
formalism. Furthermore, the canonical structure is restored for a variant of
the Koopman-von Neumann construction that carries a different phase dynamics.
Going back to van Hove's prequantum theory, the corresponding Koopman-van Hove
equation provides an alternative Clebsch representation which is then coupled
to the electromagnetic fields. Finally, the role of gauge transformations in
the new context is discussed in detail.

Koba-Nielsen amplitudes and local zeta functions (in the sense of Gel'fand,
Weil, Igusa, Sato, Bernstein, Denef, Loeser, etc.). Our research program is
motivated by the fact that the p-adic strings seem to be related in some
interesting ways with ordinary strings. For instance, connections through the
adelic relations and through the limit when p tends to 1. Gerasimov and
Shatashvili studied the limit p tends to 1 of the p-adic effective action
introduced by Brekke, Freund, Olson and Witten. They showed that this limit
gives rise to a boundary string field theory, which was previously proposed by
Witten in the context of background independent string theory. Explicit
computations in the cases of 4 and 5 points show that the Feynman amplitudes at
the tree level of the Gerasimov-Shatashvili Lagrangian are related with the
limit p tends to 1 of the p-adic Koba-Nielsen amplitudes. At a mathematical
level, this phenomenon is deeply connected with the topological zeta functions
introduced by Denef and Loeser. A Koba-Nielsen amplitude is just a new type of
local zeta function, which can be studied by using embedded resolution of
singularities. In this way, one shows the existence of a meromorphic
continuations for the Koba-Nielsen amplitudes as functions of the kinematic
parameters. The Koba-Nielsen local zeta functions are algebraic-geometric
integrals that can be defined over arbitrary local fields (for instance R, C,
Q_{p}, F_{p}((T)), and it is completely natural to expect connections between
these objects. The limit p tends to one of the Koba-Nielsen amplitudes give
rise to a new amplitudes which we have called Denef-Loeser amplitudes. Along

An algorithm is
required to guarantee competitiveness against an adversary that reveals the

about the entire neighborhood of the node (including those nodes that have not
yet been revealed). Furthermore, the adversary is required to keep the revealed
portion of the graph connected at all times. We present an algorithm that
achieves 2-competitiveness on trees and prove that this competitive ratio
cannot be improved by any other algorithm. We also present algorithms that
achieve 2.5-competitiveness on cactus graphs, $(t-1)$-competitiveness on
$K_{1,t}$-free graphs, and $\Theta(\sqrt{\Delta})$ for maximum degree $\Delta$
graphs. We show that all of those competitive ratios are tight. Then, we study
several more general classes of graphs, such as threshold, bipartite planar,

those neighbors that are among already revealed vertices. Thus, conceptually,

bound the generalization gap and then (after training) plug in the empirical
risk to obtain a bound on the true risk; or (ii) validate empirically on
holdout data. However, (i) typically yields vacuous guarantees for
overparameterized models. Furthermore, (ii) shrinks the training set and its
guarantee erodes with each re-use of the holdout set. In this paper, we
introduce a method that leverages unlabeled data to produce generalization
bounds. After augmenting our (labeled) training set with randomly labeled fresh
examples, we train in the standard fashion. Whenever classifiers achieve low
error on clean data and high error on noisy data, our bound provides a tight
upper bound on the true risk. We prove that our bound is valid for 0-1
empirical risk minimization and with linear classifiers trained by gradient
descent. Our approach is especially useful in conjunction with deep learning
due to the early learning phenomenon whereby networks fit true labels before
noisy labels but requires one intuitive assumption. Empirically, on canonical
computer vision and NLP tasks, our bound provides non-vacuous generalization
guarantees that track actual performance closely. This work provides
practitioners with an option for certifying the generalization of deep nets
even when unseen labeled data is unavailable and provides theoretical insights
into the relationship between random label noise and generalization.

deformed systems, which allows us to retain the effect of strain on the
vibrational density of states (VDOS). Starting from the nonaffine lattice
dynamics (NALD) description of elasticity and viscoelasticity of glasses, we
formulate the linear response theory up to large deformations by considering
the strain-dependent tangent modulus at finite values of shear strain. The
(nonaffine) tangent shear modulus is computed from the vibrational density of
states (VDOS) of affinely strained configurations at varying strain values. The
affine strain, found analytically on the static (undeformed) snapshot of the
glass, leads to configurations that are rich of soft low-energy modes as well
as unstable modes (negative eigenvalues) that are otherwise completely ""washed
out"" and lost, if one lets the system relax after strain. This procedure is
fully consistent with the structure of NALD. The INM spectrum of deformed
states allows for the analytical prediction of the stress-strain curve of a
model glass, including the prediction of the yield point. Good parameter-free
quantitative agreement is shown between the prediction and simulations of
athermal quasi-static shear of a coarse-grained polymer glass.

can become rigid when compressed or sheared. At low density, one can distort
the shape of a container of granular material without encountering any
resistance. Under isotropic compression, the material will reach a certain {\it
jamming} density and then resist further compression. {\em Shear jamming}
occurs when resistance to shear emerges in a system at a density lower than the
jamming density, and the elastic properties of such states have important
implications for industrial and geophysical processes. We report on
experimental observations of changes in the mechanical properties of a
shear-jammed granular material subjected to small-amplitude, quasi-static
cyclic shear. We study a layer of plastic discs confined to a shear cell, using
photoelasticimetry to measure all inter-particle vector forces. For
sufficiently small cyclic shear amplitudes and large enough initial shear, the
material evolves to an unexpected ""ultra-stable"" state in which all the
particle positions and inter-particle contact forces remain unchanged after
each complete shear cycle for thousands of cycles. The stress response of these
states to small imposed shear is nearly elastic, in contrast to the original
shear jammed state.

period. Aberration-free momentum distributions have been recorded at chopped
pulse periods of 5MHz (at MAX II) and 1.25MHz (at BESSY II). The approach is
benchmarked against the alternative way of implementing a dispersive element,
e.g. a hemispherical analyzer, in the electron optics. Both approaches,
chopping in the time domain as well as bandpass pre-selection in the energy
domain, can enable efficient ToF spectroscopy, spectroscopic real-space imaging

time-varying constraints over a network of agents. This is a sequential
decision making problem with two sequences of arbitrarily varying convex loss
and constraint functions. At each round, each agent selects a decision from the
decision set, and then only a portion of the loss function and a coordinate
block of the constraint function at this round are privately revealed to this
agent. The goal of the network is to minimize the network-wide loss accumulated
over time. Two distributed online algorithms with full-information and bandit
feedback are proposed. Both dynamic and static network regret bounds are
analyzed for the proposed algorithms, and network cumulative constraint
violation is used to measure constraint violation, which excludes the situation
that strictly feasible constraints can compensate the effects of violated
constraints. In particular, we show that the proposed algorithms achieve
$\mathcal{O}(T^{\max\{\kappa,1-\kappa\}})$ static network regret and
$\mathcal{O}(T^{1-\kappa/2})$ network cumulative constraint violation, where
$T$ is the time horizon and $\kappa\in(0,1)$ is a user-defined trade-off
parameter. Moreover, if the loss functions are strongly convex, then the static
network regret bound can be reduced to $\mathcal{O}(T^{\kappa})$. Finally,
numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the
theoretical results.

subject to repeated projective measurements to the initial state at random
times? A question of general interest is: How does the survival probability
$S_m$, namely, the probability that an initial state survives even after $m$
number of measurements, behave as a function of $m$? We address these issues in
the context of two paradigmatic quantum systems, one, the quantum random walk
evolving in discrete time, and the other, the tight-binding model evolving in
continuous time, with both defined on a one-dimensional periodic lattice with a
finite number of sites $N$. For these two models, we present several numerical
and analytical results that hint at the curious nature of quantum measurement
dynamics. In particular, we unveil that when evolution after every projective
measurement continues with the projected component of the instantaneous state,
the average and the typical survival probability decay as an exponential in $m$
for large $m$. By contrast, if the evolution continues with the leftover
component, namely, what remains of the instantaneous state after a measurement
has been performed, the survival probability exhibits two characteristic $m$
values, namely, $m_1^\star(N) \sim N$ and $m_2^\star(N) \sim N^\delta$ with
$\delta >1$. These scales are such that (i) for $m$ large and satisfying $m <
m_1^\star(N)$, the decay of the survival probability is as $m^{-2}$, (ii) for
$m$ satisfying $m_1^\star(N) \ll m < m_2^\star(N)$, the decay is as $m^{-3/2}$,
while (iii) for $m \gg m_2^\star(N)$, the decay is as an exponential. We find
that our results hold independently of the choice of the distribution of times
between successive measurements, as have been corroborated by our results for a
wide range of distributions. This fact hints at robustness and ubiquity of our
derived results.

transmission time, required to serve them all.
  We propose a queue-based hybrid digital-analog coding scheme that achieves
optimal performance for the duration of analog transmissions. We characterize
the number of analog transmissions that can be sent as the solution to a linear
program and furthermore give sufficient conditions for which optimal
performance can be achieved by all users. In some cases, we find that users can
be point-to-point optimal regardless of their distortion constraints.
  When the analog transmissions are insufficient in meeting user demands, we
propose two subsequent coding schemes. The first uses a queue preprocessing
strategy for channel coding. The second method is a novel chaining algorithm,
which involves the transmitter targeting point-to-point optimal performance for
two users as if they were the only users in the network. Meanwhile, the third
user simultaneously builds ""chains"" of symbols that he may at times be able to
decode based on the channel conditions, and the subsequent reception of
additional symbols.

achieve better spectrum and energy efficiency in 5G system. The channel state
information (CSI) needs to be fed back from the user equipment to the base
station in frequency division duplexing (FDD) mode. However, the overhead of
the direct feedback is unacceptable due to the large antenna array in massive
MIMO system. Recently, deep learning is widely adopted to the compressed CSI
feedback task and proved to be effective. In this paper, a novel network named
aggregated channel reconstruction network (ACRNet) is designed to boost the
feedback performance with network aggregation and parametric rectified linear
unit (PReLU) activation. The practical deployment of the feedback network in
the communication system is also considered. Specifically, the elastic feedback
scheme is proposed to flexibly adapt the network to meet different resource
limitations. Besides, the network binarization technique is combined with the
feature quantization for lightweight and practical deployment. Experiments show
that the proposed ACRNet outperforms loads of previous state-of-the-art
networks, providing a neat feedback solution with high performance, low cost
and impressive flexibility.

perturbation theory (CIPT), fixed-order perturbation theory (FOPT), and
Principal Value of the Borel resummation (PV). All the methods involve
truncations in the order of the coupling. In contrast to the truncated CIPT

perception performance of LiDARs on autonomous vehicles. While most of the
existing works focus on developing new deep learning algorithms or model
architectures, we study the problem from the physical design perspective, i.e.,
how different placements of multiple LiDARs influence the learning-based
perception. To this end, we introduce an easy-to-compute information-theoretic
surrogate metric to quantitatively and fast evaluate LiDAR placement for 3D
detection of different types of objects. We also present a new data collection,
detection model training and evaluation framework in the realistic CARLA
simulator to evaluate disparate multi-LiDAR configurations. Using several
prevalent placements inspired by the designs of self-driving companies, we show
the correlation between our surrogate metric and object detection performance
of different representative algorithms on KITTI through extensive experiments,
validating the effectiveness of our LiDAR placement evaluation approach. Our
results show that sensor placement is non-negligible in 3D point cloud-based
object detection, which will contribute up to 10% performance discrepancy in
terms of average precision in challenging 3D object detection settings. We
believe that this is one of the first studies to quantitatively investigate the
influence of LiDAR placement on perception performance. The code is available

model, Faster R-CNN, localizes the lesions within the 2D domain. These detected
skin lesions are mapped back to the 3D surface of the subject and, for subjects
imaged multiple times, we construct a graph-based matching procedure to
longitudinally track lesions that considers the anatomical correspondences
among pairs of meshes and the geodesic proximity of corresponding lesions and
the inter-lesion geodesic distances.
  We evaluated the proposed approach using 3DBodyTex, a publicly available
dataset composed of 3D scans imaging the coloured skin (textured meshes) of 200
human subjects. We manually annotated locations that appeared to the human eye
to contain a pigmented skin lesion as well as tracked a subset of lesions
occurring on the same subject imaged in different poses. Our results, when
compared to three human annotators, suggest that the trained Faster R-CNN
detects lesions at a similar performance level as the human annotators. Our
lesion tracking algorithm achieves an average matching accuracy of 88% on a set
of detected corresponding pairs of prominent lesions of subjects imaged in
different poses, and an average longitudinal accuracy of 71% when encompassing
additional errors due to lesion detection. As there currently is no other
large-scale publicly available dataset of 3D total-body skin lesions, we
publicly release over 25,000 3DBodyTex manual annotations, which we hope will

common phenomenon that undermines the reliability and efficiency of bus
services. Despite recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
on traffic control, little research has focused on bus fleet control due to the
tricky asynchronous characteristic -- control actions only happen when a bus
arrives at a bus stop and thus agents do not act simultaneously. In this study,
we formulate route-level bus fleet control as an asynchronous multi-agent

architecture to handle the asynchronous issue. Specifically, we design a novel
critic network to effectively approximate the marginal contribution for other

optimize its policy more efficiently. We evaluate the proposed framework on

canal therapy evaluation dataset with 245 root canal therapy X-ray images, and
the experiment results show that our AGMB-Transformer can improve the diagnosis
accuracy from 57.96% to 90.20% compared with the baseline network. The proposed
AGMB-Transformer can achieve a highly accurate evaluation of root canal

equation, which is composed of the Lagrangian integration of the equilibrium
and the free particle transport of the nonequilibrium state. With the implicit
evaluation of the macroscopic variables in the first iterative step, the
integration of the equilibrium can be directly used in the flux calculation of
macroscopic flow variables in the second iterative step. This is equivalent to
include the viscous flux in the implicit scheme to accelerate the convergence
of the solution instead of using the Euler flux in the iterative process of the
original IUGKS. In the present IUGKS, the update of macroscopic flow variables
are closely coupled with the implicit evolution of the gas distribution
function. At the same time, in order to get the more accurate solution, the
full Boltzmann collision term is incorporated into the current scheme through
the penalty method. Different iterative techniques, such as LU-SGS and
multi-grid, are used for solving the linear algebraic system of coupled
macroscopic and microscopic equations. The efficiency of the IUGKS has reached
a favorable level among all implicit schemes for the kinetic equations in the
literature. Several numerical examples are used to validate the performance of
the IUGKS. Accurate solutions have been obtained efficiently in all flow
regimes from low speed to hypersonic ones.

setting that the number of samples and the dimension of variables are large,
and even the dimension of variables grows faster than the number of samples.
False discovery rate (FDR) control aims to identify some small number of
statistically significantly nonzero results after getting the sparse penalized
estimation of GLMs. Using the CLIME method for precision matrix estimations, we
construct the debiased-Lasso estimator and prove the asymptotical normality by
minimax-rate oracle inequalities for sparse GLMs. In practice, it is often
needed to accurately judge each regression coefficient's positivity and
negativity, which determines whether the predictor variable is positively or
negatively related to the response variable conditionally on the rest
variables. Using the debiased estimator, we establish multiple testing
procedures. Under mild conditions, we show that the proposed debiased
statistics can asymptotically control the directional (sign) FDR and
directional false discovery variables at a pre-specified significance level.
Moreover, it can be shown that our multiple testing procedure can approximately
achieve a statistical power of 1. We also extend our methods to the two-sample
problems and propose the two-sample test statistics. Under suitable conditions,
we can asymptotically achieve directional FDR control and directional FDV
control at the specified significance level for two-sample problems. Some
numerical simulations have successfully verified the FDR control effects of our
proposed testing procedures, which sometimes outperforms the classical knockoff
method.

framework at the network edge, coined over-the-air mixup ML (AirMixML). In
AirMixML, multiple workers transmit analog-modulated signals of their private
data samples to an edge server who trains an ML model using the received
noisy-and superpositioned samples. AirMixML coincides with model training using
mixup data augmentation achieving comparable accuracy to that with raw data
samples. From a privacy perspective, AirMixML is a differentially private (DP)
mechanism limiting the disclosure of each worker's private sample information
at the server, while the worker's transmit power determines the privacy
disclosure level. To this end, we develop a fractional channel-inversion power
control (PC) method, {\alpha}-Dirichlet mixup PC (DirMix({\alpha})-PC), wherein
for a given global power scaling factor after channel inversion, each worker's
local power contribution to the superpositioned signal is controlled by the
Dirichlet dispersion ratio {\alpha}. Mathematically, we derive a closed-form
expression clarifying the relationship between the local and global PC factors
to guarantee a target DP level. By simulations, we provide DirMix({\alpha})-PC
design guidelines to improve accuracy, privacy, and energy-efficiency. Finally,
AirMixML with DirMix({\alpha})-PC is shown to achieve reasonable accuracy

large-scale datasets which limits their applicability. However, in the actual
systems with limitations such as measurement error and data acquisition
problems, people usually obtain incomplete data. Although data completion has
attracted wide attention, the underlying data pattern and relativity are still
under-developed. Currently, the family of latent variable models allows
learning deep latent variables over observed variables by fitting the marginal
distribution. As far as we know, current methods fail to perceive the data
relativity under partial observation. Aiming at modeling incomplete data, this
work uses relational inference to fill in the incomplete data. Specifically, we
expect to approximate the real joint distribution over the partial observation
and latent variables, thus infer the unseen targets respectively. To this end,
we propose Omni-Relational Network (OR-Net) to model the pointwise relativity
in two aspects: (i) On one hand, the inner relationship is built among the
context points in the partial observation; (ii) On the other hand, the unseen
targets are inferred by learning the cross-relationship with the observed data
points. It is further discovered that the proposed method can be generalized to
different scenarios regardless of whether the physical structure can be
observed or not. It is demonstrated that the proposed OR-Net can be well
generalized for data completion tasks of various modalities, including function
regression, image completion on MNIST and CelebA datasets, and also sequential

less complex scenarios autonomous driving may have the potentiality to reliably
outperform humans. For example, humans are good at interactive tasks (while
autonomous driving systems usually do not), but we are often incompetent for
tasks with strict precision demands. In this paper, we introduce a real-world,
industrial scenario of which human drivers are not capable. The task required
the ego vehicle to keep a stationary lateral distance (i.e. 3? <= 5
centimeters) with respect to a reference. To address this challenge, we
redesigned the control module from Baidu Apollo open-source autonomous driving
system. A precise (3? <= 2 centimeters) Error Feedback System was first built
to partly replace the localization module. Then we investigated the control
module thoroughly and added a real-time calibration algorithm to gain extra
precision. We also built a simulation to fine-tune the control parameters.
After all those works, the results are encouraging, showing that an end-to-end
lateral precision with 3? <= 5 centimeters has been achieved. Further, we show
that the results not only outperformed original Apollo modules but also beat

basic idea is to predefine the class centers, which are evenly-distributed on
the unit hypersphere in feature space, to maximize the inter-class distance.
The previous method of generating PEDCC uses an iterative algorithm based on a
charge model, that is, the initial values of various centers (charge positions)
are randomly set from the normal distribution, and the charge positions are
updated iteratively with the help of the repulsive force between charges of the
same polarity. The class centers generated by the algorithm will produce some
errors with the theoretically evenly-distributed points, and the generation
time will be longer. This paper takes advantage of regular polyhedron in
high-dimensional space and the evenly distribution of points on the n
dimensional hypersphere to generate PEDCC mathematically. Then, we discussed
the basic and extensive characteristics of the frames formed by PEDCC. Finally,
experiments show that new algorithm is not only faster than the iterative
method, but also more accurate in position. The mathematical analysis and

years. Despite the progress, efficient and accurate end-to-end spotting of
arbitrarily-shaped text remains challenging. In this work, we propose an
end-to-end text spotting framework, termed PAN++, which can efficiently detect
and recognize text of arbitrary shapes in natural scenes. PAN++ is based on the
kernel representation that reformulates a text line as a text kernel (central
region) surrounded by peripheral pixels. By systematically comparing with
existing scene text representations, we show that our kernel representation can
not only describe arbitrarily-shaped text but also well distinguish adjacent
text. Moreover, as a pixel-based representation, the kernel representation can
be predicted by a single fully convolutional network, which is very friendly to
real-time applications. Taking the advantages of the kernel representation, we
design a series of components as follows: 1) a computationally efficient
feature enhancement network composed of stacked Feature Pyramid Enhancement
Modules (FPEMs); 2) a lightweight detection head cooperating with Pixel
Aggregation (PA); and 3) an efficient attention-based recognition head with
Masked RoI. Benefiting from the kernel representation and the tailored
components, our method achieves high inference speed while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method.
For example, the proposed PAN++ achieves an end-to-end text spotting F-measure
of 64.9 at 29.2 FPS on the Total-Text dataset, which significantly outperforms
the previous best method. Code will be available at: https://git.io/PAN.

sigmoid from the active region (AR) NOAA 11909 on 07 December 2013, by
analyzing multi-wavelength and multi-instrument observations. Our analysis
suggests that the formation of `transient' sigmoid initiated $\approx$1 hour
before its eruption through a coupling between two twisted coronal loop
systems. A comparison between coronal and photospheric images suggests that the
coronal sigmoid was formed over a simple $\beta$-type AR which also possessed
dispersed magnetic field structure in the photosphere. The line-of-sight
photospheric magnetograms also reveal moving magnetic features, small-scale
flux cancellation events near the PIL, and overall flux cancellation during the
extended pre-eruption phase which suggest the role of tether-cutting
reconnection toward the build-up of the flux rope. The disruption of the
sigmoid proceeded with a two-ribbon eruptive M1.2 flare (SOL2013-12-07T07:29).
In radio frequencies, we observe type III and type II bursts in meter
wavelengths during the impulsive phase of the flare. The successful eruption of
the flux rope leads to a fast coronal mass ejection (with a linear speed of
$\approx$1085 km s -1 ) in SOHO/LASCO field-of-view. During the evolution of
the flare, we clearly observe typical ""sigmoid-to-arcade"" transformation. Prior
to the onset of the impulsive phase of the flare, flux rope undergoes a slow
rise ($\approx$15 km s -1 ) which subsequently transitions into a fast eruption
($\approx$110 km s -1 ). The two-phase evolution of the flux rope shows
temporal associations with the soft X-ray precursor and impulsive phase
emissions of the M-class flare, respectively, thus pointing toward a feedback
relationship between magnetic reconnection and early CME dynamics.

in the real-world applications. For more accurate prediction, the methods had
better grasp more data characteristics. Different from ordinary time series,
ISTS is characterised with irregular time intervals of intra-series and
different sampling rates of inter-series. However, existing methods have
suboptimal predictions due to artificially introducing new dependencies in a
time series and biasedly learning relations among time series when modeling
these two characteristics. In this work, we propose a novel Time Encoding (TE)
mechanism. TE can embed the time information as time vectors in the complex
domain. It has the the properties of absolute distance and relative distance
under different sampling rates, which helps to represent both two
irregularities of ISTS. Meanwhile, we create a new model structure named Time
Encoding Echo State Network (TE-ESN). It is the first ESNs-based model that can
process ISTS data. Besides, TE-ESN can incorporate long short-term memories and
series fusion to grasp horizontal and vertical relations. Experiments on one
chaos system and three real-world datasets show that TE-ESN performs better
than all baselines and has better reservoir property.

strong reducing properties. Recently, hydride ion migration in
SrTiO$_{3-x}$H$_{x}$ oxyhydride crystals has been investigated, showing that
hydride ion migration is blocked by slow oxygen diffusion. In this study, we
investigate the hydride-ion migration mechanism using a kinetic Monte Carlo
approach to understanding the relationship between the hydride and oxygen ions.
The difficulties in applying the method to hydride and oxygen ion migration
involve complex changes in the ionic migration barrier, which shifts
dynamically depending on the characteristics of the surrounding hydride and
oxygen ions. We can predict these complex changes using a machine-learning
neural network model. The simulation can then be performed using this model to
predict the temperature-dependent ionic-migration behavior. We found that our
simulation results with respect to the activation barrier for hydride ion
diffusion accorded well with those obtained by experiment. We also found that
hydride ion migration is affected by slow oxygen diffusion and that oxygen
diffusion is accelerated by changes in the ionic migration barriers. The
parallel-processing efficiency of our proposed method was 84.92 \% for our
1,000-CPU implementation, suggesting that the approach should be widely
applicable to simulations of ionic migration in crystals at a reasonable
computational cost.

attracted much attention in recent years in the fields of statistics and

conditions the event that the model was selected. In this paper, we develop
selective inference in propensity score analysis with a semiparametric
approach, which has become a standard tool in causal inference. Specifically,
for the most basic causal inference model in which the causal effect can be
written as a linear sum of confounding variables, we conduct Lasso-type
variable selection by adding an $\ell_1$ penalty term to the loss function that
gives a semiparametric estimator. Confidence intervals are then given for the
coefficients of the selected confounding variables, conditional on the event of
variable selection, with asymptotic guarantees. An important property of this
method is that it does not require modeling of nonparametric regression
functions for the outcome variables, as is usually the case with semiparametric
propensity score analysis.

hardware mechanisms for protecting stack memory. Unlike ""the heap,"" the
ISA-level stack does not correspond to a single high-level language concept:
different compilers use it in different ways to support procedural and
functional abstraction mechanisms from a wide range of languages. This protean
nature makes it difficult to nail down what it means to correctly enforce stack
safety.
  We propose a formal characterization of stack safety using concepts from
language-based security. Rather than packaging all aspects of stack safety into
a monolithic property, we decompose it into an integrity property and a
confidentiality property for each of the caller and the callee, plus a
control-flow property -- five properties in all.
  This formulation is motivated by a particular class of enforcement
mechanisms, the ``lazy'' stack safety micro-policies studied by Roessler and
DeHon~\cite{DBLP:conf/sp/RoesslerD18}, which permit functions to write into one
another's frames, but which taint the changed locations so that the frame's
owner cannot access it. No existing characterization of stack safety captures
this style of safety. We capture it here by stating our properties in terms of
the observable behavior of the system.
  Our properties go further than previous formal definitions of stack safety,
supporting caller- and callee-saved registers, arguments passed on the stack,
and tail-call elimination.
  We validate our properties by using them to distinguish between correct and
incorrect implementations of Roessler and DeHon's micro-policies using
property-based random testing. Our test harness successfully identifies several
broken variants, including Roessler and DeHon's lazy policy; a repaired version
of their policy does pass our tests.

because of the complex nature of non-Euclidean graph data. In this paper, we
propose the first-ever deep graph super-resolution (GSR) framework that
attempts to automatically generate high-resolution (HR) brain graphs with N'
nodes (i.e., anatomical regions of interest (ROIs)) from low-resolution (LR)
graphs with N nodes where N < N'. First, we formalize our GSR problem as a node
feature embedding learning task. Once the HR nodes' embeddings are learned, the
pairwise connectivity strength between brain ROIs can be derived through an
aggregation rule based on a novel Graph U-Net architecture. While typically the
Graph U-Net is a node-focused architecture where graph embedding depends mainly
on node attributes, we propose a graph-focused architecture where the node
feature embedding is based on the graph topology. Second, inspired by graph
spectral theory, we break the symmetry of the U-Net architecture by
super-resolving the low-resolution brain graph structure and node content with
a GSR layer and two graph convolutional network layers to further learn the
node embeddings in the HR graph. Third, to handle the domain shift between the
ground-truth and the predicted HR brain graphs, we incorporate adversarial
regularization to align their respective distributions. Our proposed AGSR-Net
framework outperformed its variants for predicting high-resolution functional
brain graphs from low-resolution ones. Our AGSR-Net code is available on GitHub

attention and provide a new possibility to directly probe the early Universe.
In the preheating process at the end of inflation, parametric resonance can
generate large energy density perturbations and efficiently produce
gravitational waves (GWs) which carry unique information about inflation. Since
the peak frequency of such GWs is approximately proportional to the
inflationary energy scale, $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$, GWs from preheating are
expected to be observed by interferometer GW detectors in low-scale
inflationary models. We investigate the dependence of the amplitude of such GWs
on $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$, and find that the present energy spectrum of these
GWs does not depend on $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$ only in the case of
$\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$ is above a critical value $\Lambda_{c}$, a parameter
depending on the resonance strength. We numerically obtain $\Lambda_{c}$ in
terms of the model parameters in linear approximation and then conduct lattice
simulations to verify this result. For
$\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}\lesssim\Lambda_{c}$, the amplitude of GWs quickly
decreases with $\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$ and becomes challenging to observe. In
turn, observing such GWs in interferometer detectors also helps to determine
$\Lambda_{\mathrm{inf}}$ and the resonance strength during the preheating.

  DNN-based Approach","To appear in IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid",,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coordinating inverters at scale under uncertainty is the desideratum for
integrating renewables in distribution grids. Unless load demands and solar
generation are telemetered frequently, controlling inverters given approximate
grid conditions or proxies thereof becomes a key specification. Although deep
neural networks (DNNs) can learn optimal inverter schedules, guaranteeing
feasibility is largely elusive. Rather than training DNNs to imitate already
computed optimal power flow (OPF) solutions, this work integrates DNN-based
inverter policies into the OPF. The proposed DNNs are trained through two OPF
alternatives that confine voltage deviations on the average and as a convex
restriction of chance constraints. The trained DNNs can be driven by partial,
noisy, or proxy descriptors of the current grid conditions. This is important
when OPF has to be solved for an unobservable feeder. DNN weights are trained
via back-propagation and upon differentiating the AC power flow equations
assuming the network model is known. Otherwise, a gradient-free variant is put
forth. The latter is relevant when inverters are controlled by an aggregator
having access only to a power flow solver or a digital twin of the feeder.
Numerical tests compare the DNN-based inverter control schemes with the optimal
inverter setpoints in terms of optimality and feasibility.

$\mathfrak F$ be a class of groups. Then $\sigma (G)=\{\sigma_i\mid
\sigma_i\cap \pi (G)\ne \emptyset\} $ and $\sigma (\mathfrak F)=\cup_{G\in
\mathfrak F}\sigma (G).$ A function $f$ of the form $f:\sigma
\to\{\text{formations of groups}\}$ is called a formation $\sigma$-function.
For any formation $\sigma$-function $f$ the class $LF_\sigma(f)$ is defined as
follows: $$ LF_\sigma(f)=(G \text{ is a group } \mid G=1 \text{ or } G\ne 1\
\text{ and }\ G/O_{\sigma_i', \sigma_i}(G) \in f(\sigma_i) \text{ for all }

$\mathfrak F=LF_\sigma(f),$ then $\mathfrak F$ is called $\sigma$-local, $f$ is
called a $\sigma$-local definition of $\mathfrak F.$
  Every formation is called 0-multiply $\sigma$-local. For $n > 0,$ a formation
$\mathfrak F$ is called $n$-multiply $\sigma$-local provided either $\mathfrak
F=(1)$ or $\mathfrak F=LF_\sigma(f),$ where $f(\sigma_i)$ is $(n-1)$-multiply
$\sigma$-local for all $\sigma_i\in \sigma(\mathfrak F).$
  Let $\tau(G)$ be a set of subgroups of $G$ such that $G\in \tau(G)$. Then
$\tau$ is called a subgroup functor if for every epimorphism $\varphi$ : $A

$H^{\varphi}\in\tau(B)$ and $T^{{\varphi}^{-1}}\in\tau(A)$. A class $\mathfrak

  We describe some properties of $\tau$-closed $n$-multiply $\sigma$-local
formations, as well as we prove that the set $l^{\tau}_{\sigma_n}$ of all
$\tau$-closed $n$-multiply $\sigma$-local formations forms a complete modular
algebraic lattice. In addition, we proof that $l^{\tau}_{\sigma_n}$ is

to simultaneously fool multiple learning models, has long been the ""big bad
wolf"" of adversarial machine learning. Successful transferability-based attacks
requiring no prior knowledge of the attacked model's parameters or training
data have been demonstrated numerous times in the past, implying that machine
learning models pose an inherent security threat to real-life systems. However,
all of the research performed in this area regarded transferability as a
probabilistic property and attempted to estimate the percentage of adversarial
examples that are likely to mislead a target model given some predefined
evaluation set. As a result, those studies ignored the fact that real-life
adversaries are often highly sensitive to the cost of a failed attack. We argue
that overlooking this sensitivity has led to an exaggerated perception of the
transferability threat, when in fact real-life transferability-based attacks
are quite unlikely. By combining theoretical reasoning with a series of
empirical results, we show that it is practically impossible to predict whether
a given adversarial example is transferable to a specific target model in a
black-box setting, hence questioning the validity of adversarial
transferability as a real-life attack tool for adversaries that are sensitive
to the cost of a failed attack.

However, in the absence of considering drivers' preferences, current route
planning algorithms are developed under ideal situations where all drivers are
expected to behave rationally and properly. Especially, for jumbled urban road
networks, drivers' actual routing strategies deteriorated to a series of
empirical and selfish decisions that result in congestion. Self-evidently, if
minimum mobility can be kept, traffic congestion is avoidable by traffic load
dispersing. In this paper, we establish a novel dynamic routing method catering
drivers' preferences and retaining maximum traffic mobility simultaneously
through multi-agent systems (MAS). Modeling human-drivers' behavior through
agents' dynamics, MAS can analyze the global behavior of the entire traffic
flow. Therefore, regarding agents as particles in smoothed particles
hydrodynamics (SPH), we can enforce the traffic flow to behave like a real
flow. Thereby, with the characteristic of distributing itself uniformly in road
networks, our dynamic routing method realizes traffic load balancing without
violating the individual time-saving motivation. Moreover, as a discrete
control mechanism, our method is robust to chaos meaning driver's disobedience
can be tolerated. As controlled by SPH based density, the only intelligent
transportation system (ITS) we require is the location-based service (LBS). A
mathematical proof is accomplished to scrutinize the stability of the proposed
control law. Also, multiple testing cases are built to verify the effectiveness
of the proposed dynamic routing algorithm.

should decide if this graph satisfies a certain property $\Phi$. What happens
if this question is modified in a way that we get a possibly infinite family of
graphs as an input, and the question is if there is a graph satisfying $\Phi$
in the family? We approach this question by using formal languages for
specifying families of graphs, in particular by regular sets of words. We show
that certain graph properties can be decided by studying the syntactic monoid
of the specification language $L$ if a certain torsion condition is satisfied.
This condition holds trivially if $L$ is regular. More specifically, we use a
natural binary encoding of finite graphs over a binary alphabet $\Sigma$, and
we define a regular set $\mathbb{G}\subseteq \Sigma^*$ such that every nonempty
word $w\in \mathbb{G}$ defines a finite and nonempty graph. Also, graph
properties can then be syntactically defined as languages over $\Sigma$. Then,
we ask whether the automaton $\mathcal{A}$ specifies some graph satisfying a
certain property~$\Phi$. Our structural results show that we can answer this
question for all ""typical"" graph properties.
  In order to show our results, we split $L$ into a finite union of subsets and
every subset of this union defines in a natural way a single finite graph $F$
where some edges and vertices are marked. The marked graph in turn defines an
infinite graph $F^\infty$ and therefore the family of finite subgraphs of
$F^\infty$ where $F$ appears as an induced subgraph. This yields a geometric
description of all graphs specified by $L$ based on splitting $L$ into finitely
many pieces; then using the notion of graph retraction, we obtain an easily
understandable description of the graphs in each piece.

prioritizes the jobs with the smallest volume-by-weight ratio. We bound its
approximation ratio with a decreasing function of the ratio between the highest
resource demand of any job to the server's capacity.
  Then, we use the algorithm for scheduling jobs with resource demands equal to

weighted shortest processing time algorithm for jobs with resource demands
higher than 0.5. We thus create a hybrid, constant approximation algorithm for
two or more machines. We also develop a constant approximation algorithm for
the case with a single machine. This research is the first, to the best of our

communication between processes that share cellular automata neighborhood
values while also allowing for reproducibility during stochastic updates. We
demonstrated the potential of our solution on a complex hybrid cellular

problem size, whereas weak parallel scaling showed moderate growth in solving
time relative to increase in problem size. Finally we applied the algorithm to
a problem that is 500 times larger than previous work, allowing us to run

trapped because of the local absence of pressure gradient. These regions could
be ideal places to form planetesimals or to isolate isotopic reservoirs.
Observations of protoplanetary disks show that dusty rings structures are
common, and pressure maxima are sometime invoked as a possible explanation. In
our Solar System, pressure bumps have been suggested as a possible mechanism
for separating reservoirs with different nucleosynthetic compositions. In this
letter we detail a mechanism by which pressure maxima form just inward the
snow-line in stratified disks. This mechanism does not need the presence of a
planet. Using a combination of analytical and numerical investigation we
explore the range of conditions for a pressure maximum to form inside the
dead-zone and just inward the snow-line. When the vertically averaged $\alpha$
is a decreasing function of surface density then the release of water vapor at
the snow-line lowers the sound velocity, and in turn, a pressure bump appears.
This requires a constant inflow of icy pebbles with pebbles influx to gas
influx $>0.6$ for a power law disk with $1\%$ ice/gas ratio, and $>1.8$ for a
disk with ice/gas ratio $\sim 0.3\%$. If these conditions are met, then a
Pressure-maximum appears just inward the snow-line due to a process coupling
the dead and active layers at the evaporation front. The pressure bump survives
as long as the icy pebble flux is high enough. The formation of the pressure
bump is triggered by the drop of sound velocity inward the snow-line, due to
the release of water vapor. This mechanism is promising for isolating early
reservoirs carrying different isotopic signatures in the Solar System and for
promoting dry planetesimal formation inward the snow-line, provided the
vertically averaged description of a dead-zone is valid.

area of research. We address this challenge using an equilibrium framework
where firms' decisions to form links with other firms are modeled as a
strategic game. In this game, firms weigh the costs and benefits of
establishing a relationship with other firms and form ties if their net payoffs
are positive. We characterize the equilibrium networks as exponential random
graphs (ERGM), and we estimate the firms' payoffs using a Bayesian approach. To
demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we apply the framework to a
co-investment network of venture capital firms in the medical device industry.
The equilibrium framework allows researchers to draw economic interpretation
from parameter estimates of the ERGM Model. We learn that firms rely on their
joint partners (transitivity) and prefer to form ties with firms similar to
themselves (homophily). These results hold after controlling for the
interdependence among ties. Another, critical advantage of a structural
approach is that it allows us to simulate the effects of economic shocks or
policy counterfactuals. We test two such policy shocks, namely, firm entry and
regulatory change. We show how new firms' entry or a regulatory shock of

through the learning of contrast-to-contrast translation that effectively

is collaboratively used with another feature that is the low-dimensional

capillary tube connecting two reservoirs. Usually, one component is
preferentially adsorbed onto the tube wall, and the adsorption becomes
significant owing to large osmotic susceptibility. The mixture flowing out of
the tube is rich in the preferred component when flow is driven by the pressure
difference between the reservoirs. When flow is driven by the mass-fraction
difference, the total mass flow occurs in the presence of the preferential
adsorption, which means that diffusioosmosis emerges. These phenomena can be
regarded as cross effects linked by the reciprocal relation. We also study
these phenomena numerically by using the hydrodynamics based on the
coarse-grained free-energy functional, which was previously obtained in terms
of the renormalized local functional theory. It is shown in particular that the

devices. To engineer skyrmions in vdW magnets by transforming Bloch-type
magnetic bubbles into N\'eel-type skyrmions, the heterostructure of heavy

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, the unambiguous
identification of the magnetic textures inherent to vdW magnets, e.g., whether
the magnetic twists (skyrmions/domain walls) are N\'eel- or Bloch-type, is
unclear. Here we demonstrate that the N\'eel- or Bloch-type magnetic twists can
be tuned in the vdW magnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) with/without interfacial DMI. We use
an in-plane magnetic field to align the modulation wavevector q of the
magnetizations in order to distinguish the N\'eel- or Bloch-type magnetic
twists. We observe that q is perpendicular to the in-plane field in the
heterostructure (Pt/oxidized-FGT/FGT/oxidized-FGT), while q aligns at a rotated
angle with respect to the field direction in the thin plate by thinning bulk
FGT. We find that the aligned domain wall twists hold fan-like modulations,
coinciding qualitatively with our computational results.

and motivated by reducing communication resource overhead, we propose a new
multi-level over-the-air (OTA) aggregation scheme for the destination WD to
collect the individual partially aggregated intermediate values (IVAs) for
reduction from multiple source WDs in the data shuffling phase. For OTA
aggregation per level, the source WDs employ a channel inverse structure
multiplied by their individual transmit coefficients in transmission over the
same time frequency resource blocks, and the destination WD finally uses a
receive filtering factor to construct the aggregated IVA. Under this setup, we
develop a unified transceiver design framework that minimizes the mean squared
error (MSE) of the aggregated IVA at the destination WD subject to the source
WDs' individual power constraints, by jointly optimizing the source WDs'
individual transmit coefficients and the destination WD's receive filtering
factor. First, based on the primal decomposition method, we derive the
closed-form solution under the special case of a common transmit coefficient.
It shows that all the source WDs' common transmit is determined by the minimal
transmit power budget among the source WDs. Next, for the general case, we
transform the original problem into a quadratic fractional programming problem,
and then develop a low-complexity algorithm to obtain the (near-) optimal
solution by leveraging Dinkelbach's algorithm along with the Gaussian
randomization method.

$A^{}_r=L^{}_y/L^{}_x$, and temperature $T$. In the case of weak dipolar
interaction ($h^{}_d\approx0$) and substantial temperature, the magnetic
relaxation follows the N\'eel Brown model as expected. Interestingly, the
dipolar interaction of enough strength is found to induce antiferromagnetic
coupling in the square arrangement of MNPs ($A^{}_r=1.0$), resulting in the
fastening of magnetic relaxation with $h^{}_d$. There is also a rapid increase
in relaxation even with $A^{}_r<100$ above a particular dipolar interaction
strength $h^{\star}_d$, which gets enhanced with $A^{}_r$. Remarkably, there is
a slowing down of magnetic relaxation with $h^{}_d$ for the highly anisotropic
system such as linear chain of MNPs. It is because the dipolar interaction
induces ferromagnetic interaction in such a case. The thermal fluctuations also
affect the relaxation properties drastically. In the case of weak dipolar
limit, magnetization relaxes rapidly with $T$ because of enhancement in thermal
fluctuations. The effect of dipolar interaction and aspect ratio on the
magnetic relaxation is also clearly indicated in the variation of N\'eel
relaxation time $\tau^{}_N$. In the presence of strong dipolar interaction
($h^{}_d>0.3$) and $A^{}_r=1.0$, $\tau^{}_N$ decreases with $h^{}_d$ for a
given temperature. On the other hand, there is an increase in $\tau^{}_N$ with

information from unstructured text for a particular event of interest. The
existing works exhibit poor capabilities to extract causal event arguments like
Reason and After Effects. Furthermore, most of the existing works model this
task at a sentence level, restricting the context to a local scope. While it
may be effective for short spans of text, for longer bodies of text such as
news articles, it has often been observed that the arguments for an event do
not necessarily occur in the same sentence as that containing an event trigger.
To tackle the issue of argument scattering across sentences, the use of global
context becomes imperative in this task. In our work, we propose an external
knowledge aided approach to infuse document-level event information to aid the
extraction of complex event arguments. We develop a causal network for our
event-annotated dataset by extracting relevant event causal structures from
ConceptNet and phrases from Wikipedia. We use the extracted event causal
features in a bi-directional transformer encoder to effectively capture
long-range inter-sentence dependencies. We report the effectiveness of our
proposed approach through both qualitative and quantitative analysis. In this
task, we establish our findings on an event annotated dataset in 5 Indian
languages. This dataset adds further complexity to the task by labelling
arguments of entity type (like Time, Place) as well as more complex argument
types (like Reason, After-Effect). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across all the five languages. Since our work does not rely on any
language-specific features, it can be easily extended to other languages.

impedes applying many conventional computer vision techniques to event streams,
and specific algorithms should be designed to leverage the information provided
by event cameras. We propose a corner detection algorithm, eSUSAN, inspired by
the conventional SUSAN (smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus)
algorithm for corner detection. The proposed eSUSAN extracts the univalue
segment assimilating nucleus from the circle kernel based on the similarity
across timestamps and distinguishes corner events by the number of pixels in
the nucleus area. Moreover, eSUSAN is fast enough to be applied to CeleX-V, the
event camera with the highest resolution available. Based on eSUSAN, we also
propose the SE-Harris corner detector, which uses adaptive normalization based
on exponential decay to quickly construct a local surface of active events and
the event-based Harris detector to refine the corners identified by eSUSAN. We
evaluated the proposed algorithms on a public dataset and CeleX-V data. Both
eSUSAN and SE-Harris exhibit higher real-time performance than existing

otherwise). When the dependent variable $Y$ represents a rare event, the
logistic regression model shows relevant drawbacks. In order to overcome these
drawbacks we propose the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) regression model. In
particular, we suggest the quantile function of the GEV distribution as link

investigate the identifiability of the resulting model. Then, we conduct a

logistic model, many authors believe that there is little theoretical
justification in choosing one formulation over the other in most circumstances
involving binary responses. The logit model is considered to be computationally
simpler but it is based on a more restrictive assumption of error independence,
although many other generalizations have dealt with that assumption as well. By
contrast, the probit model assumes that random errors have a multivariate
normal distribution. This assumption makes the probit model attractive because
the normal distribution provides a good approximation to many other

single-electron tunneling through an edge-fused porphyrin oligomer and
demonstrate that its transport behavior is well described by the Hubbard dimer

the transport setting. In particular, we empirically determine the molecule's
on-site and inter-site electron-electron repulsion energies, which are in good
agreement with density functional calculations, and establish the molecular
electronic structure within various charge states. The gate-dependent
rectification behavior is used to further confirm the selection rules and state
degeneracies resulting from the Hubbard model. We therefore demonstrate that

de-facto method for hypergraph representation learning. However, HGNN aims at
single hypergraph learning and uses a pre-concatenation approach when
confronting multi-modal datasets, which leads to sub-optimal exploitation of
the inter-correlations of multi-modal hypergraphs. HGNN also suffers the
over-smoothing issue, that is, its performance drops significantly when layers
are stacked up. To resolve these issues, we propose the Residual enhanced
Multi-Hypergraph Neural Network, which can not only fuse multi-modal

over-smoothing issue associated with HGNN. We conduct experiments on two 3D

for small-large black hole phase transition, we investigate the kinetic process
of phase transition for the Kerr-AdS (anti-de Sitter) black holes on free
energy landscape. We find that the extremal points of the off shell Gibbs free
energy correspond to physical black holes. For small-large black hole phase
transition, the off shell Gibbs free energy exhibits a double well behavior
with the same depth. Contrary to previous research for the kinetics of phase
transition for the Kerr-Newman-AdS family black holes on a free energy
landscape, we find that there is a lower bound for the order parameter and the
lower bound corresponds to extremal black holes. In particular, the off shell
Gibbs free energy is zero instead of divergent as previous work suggested for
vanishing black hole horizon radius, which corresponds to the Gibbs free energy
of a thermal AdS space. The investigation for the evolution of the probability
distribution for the phase transition indicates that the initial stable small
(large) black hole tends to switch to stable large (small) black hole.
Increasing the temperature along the coexistence curve, the switching process
becomes faster and the probability distribution reaches the final stationary
Boltzmann distribution at a shorter time. The distribution of the first passage
time indicates the time scale of the small-large black hole phase transition,
and the peak of the distribution becomes sharper and shifts to the left with
the increase of temperature along the coexistence curve. This suggests that a
considerable first passage process occurs at a shorter time for higher
temperature. The investigation of the kinetics of phase transition might
provide us new insight into the underlying microscopic interactions.

of linear and nonlinear effects. This definition encompasses the interplay of
nonlinear gain and loss, leading to the concept of dissipative solitons that
has been instrumental in understanding the wide variety of mode locking
phenomena in ultrafast optics. To date, most studies have involved the group
velocity dispersion as a key ingredient for soliton generation. Here, we report
on a novel kind of soliton, both theoretically and experimentally, which builds
up in spectrally confined cavities when dispersion is practically absent.
Precisely, the interplay between the Kerr nonlinearity and spectral filtering
results in an infinite hierarchy of eigenfunctions which, combined with optical
gain, allow for the generation of stable dispersion-less dissipative solitons
in a previously uncharted regime. When the filter order tends to be infinite,
we find an unexpected link between dissipative and conservative solitons, in
the form of Nyquist-pulse-like solitons endowed with an ultra-flat spectrum. In
contrast to the dispersion-enabled solitons, these dispersion-less Nyquist
solitons build on a fully confined spectrum and their energy scaling is not
constrained by the pulse duration. This study broadens the fundamental scope of
dissipative soliton physics and opens new avenues for engineering optical
solitons endowed with superior temporal and spectral features.

challenge: none of the robust models is utterly immune to adversarial examples
to date. Different defences have been proposed; however, most of them are
tailored to particular ML models and adversarial attacks, therefore their
effectiveness and applicability are strongly limited. A similar problem plagues
cheminformatics: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models
struggle to predict biological activity for the entire chemical space because
they are trained on a very limited amount of compounds with known effects. This
problem is relieved with a technique called Applicability Domain (AD), which
rejects the unsuitable compounds for the model. Adversarial examples are
intentionally crafted inputs that exploit the blind spots which the model has
not learned to classify, and adversarial defences try to make the classifier
more robust by covering these blind spots. There is an apparent similarity
between AD and adversarial defences. Inspired by the concept of AD, we propose
a multi-stage data-driven defence that is testing for: Applicability: abnormal
values, namely inputs not compliant with the intended use case of the model;
Reliability: samples far from the training data; and Decidability: samples
whose predictions contradict the predictions of their neighbours.It can be
applied to any classification model and is not limited to specific types of
adversarial attacks. With an empirical analysis, this paper demonstrates how
Applicability Domain can effectively reduce the vulnerability of ML models to
adversarial examples.

semi-regular continued fraction $[0;x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ with partial quotients
$x_i\in A$ and where each $a_i$ occurs exactly $n_i$ times in $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.
In 1983, G. Ramharter gave an explicit description of the extremal arrangements
of the regular continued fraction and the minimizing arrangement for the
semi-regular continued fraction and showed that in each case the arrangement is
unique up to reversal and independent of the actual values of the integers
$a_i$. However, an explicit determination of a maximizing arrangement for the
semi-regular continuant turned out to be more difficult. Ramharter conjectured
that as in the other three cases, the maximizing arrangement is unique up to
reversal and depends only on the partition $P$ and not on the values of the
$a_i$. He further verified the conjecture in the case of a binary $A$. In this
paper we confirm Ramharter's conjecture for sets $A$ with $|A|=3$ and give an
algorithmic construction for the unique maximizing arrangement. We also show
that Ramharter's conjecture fails for sets with $|A|\geq 4$, as the maximizing
arrangement is in general neither unique nor independent of the values of the
digits in $A$. The central idea is that the extremal arrangements satisfy a
strong combinatorial condition, which may also be stated in the context of
infinite sequences on an ordered set. We show that for bi-infinite binary
words, this condition coincides with the Markoff property, discovered by A.A.
Markoff in 1879 in his study of minima of binary quadratic forms. We further
show that this same combinatorial condition is the fundamental property which
describes the orbit structure of the natural codings of points under a
symmetric $k$-interval exchange transformation.

investigated for its uniqueness and potential to discriminate between
individuals. This paper discusses how this discriminatory information can help
in continuous user authentication by a wearable chest strap which uses dry
electrodes to obtain a single lead ECG signal. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, this is the first such work which deals with continuous
authentication using a genuine wearable device as most prior works have either
used medical equipment employing gel electrodes to obtain an ECG signal or have
obtained an ECG signal through electrode positions that would not be feasible
using a wearable device. Prior works have also mainly dealt with using the ECG
signal for identification rather than verification, or dealt with using the ECG
signal for discrete authentication. This paper presents a novel algorithm which
uses QRS detection, weighted averaging, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and a
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to determine whether the wearer of the
device should be positively verified or not. Zero intrusion attempts were
successful when tested on a database consisting of 33 subjects.

  International Conference on Learning Representations, 2021",,,,"cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, we propose a data-driven scheme to initialize the parameters of
a deep neural network. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which
randomly initialize parameters by sampling from transformed standard
distributions. Such methods do not use the training data to produce a more
informed initialization. Our method uses a sequential layer-wise approach where
each layer is initialized using its input activations. The initialization is
cast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and
decoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a
user-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into
the well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free
solutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to
random initialization methods, both before start of training and after training
is over. We show that our proposed method is especially effective in few-shot
and fine-tuning settings. We conclude this paper with analyses on time
complexity and the effect of different latent codes on the recognition
performance.

the Mulliken visual analysis in Multiwfn to showcase our findings. We discuss
the possibility to use these electrons orbit population diagrams, in
conjunction with the more intuitive MOD diagrams to teach the Quantum Mechanics
