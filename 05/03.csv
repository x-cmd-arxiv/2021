  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reward engineering and designing an incentive reward function are non-trivial
tasks to train agents in complex environments. Furthermore, an inaccurate
reward function may lead to a biased behaviour which is far from an efficient
and optimised behaviour. In this paper, we focus on training a single agent to
score goals with binary success/failure reward function in Half Field Offense
domain. As the major advantage of this research, the agent has no presumption
about the environment which means it only follows the original formulation of
reinforcement learning agents. The main challenge of using such a reward
function is the high sparsity of positive reward signals. To address this
problem, we use a simple prediction-based exploration strategy (called Curious
Exploration) along with a Return-based Memory Restoration (RMR) technique which
tends to remember more valuable memories. The proposed method can be utilized
to train agents in environments with fairly complex state and action spaces.
Our experimental results show that many recent solutions including our baseline
method fail to learn and perform in complex soccer domain. However, the
proposed method can converge easily to the nearly optimal behaviour. The video

error-handling code from regular code, seeking to enhance software
comprehensibility and maintainability. Nevertheless, the way exception handling
(EH) code is structured in such languages may lead to multiple, different, and
complex control flows, which may affect the software testability. Previous
studies have reported that EH code is typically neglected, not well tested, and
its misuse can lead to reliability degradation and catastrophic failures.
However, little is known about the relationship between testing practices and
EH testing effectiveness. In this exploratory study, we (i) measured the
adequacy degree of EH testing concerning code coverage (instruction, branch,
and method) criteria; and (ii) evaluated the effectiveness of the EH testing by
measuring its capability to detect artificially injected faults (i.e., mutants)
using 7 EH mutation operators. Our study was performed using test suites of 27
long-lived Java libraries from open-source ecosystems. Our results show that
instructions and branches within $\mathtt{catch}$ blocks and $\mathtt{throw}$
instructions are less covered, with statistical significance than the overall
instructions and branches. Nevertheless, most of the studied libraries
presented test suites capable of detecting more than 70% of the injected
faults. From a total of 12,331 mutants created in this study, the test suites
were able to detect 68% of them.

agents acting out of individual self-interest and promoting a common good.

Networked public goods games capture this tension, with networks encoding
strategic interdependence among agents. Conventional models of public goods
games posit solely individual self-interest as a motivation, even though
altruistic motivations have long been known to play a significant role in
agents' decisions. We introduce a novel extension of public goods games to
account for altruistic motivations by adding a term in the utility function
that incorporates the perceived benefits an agent obtains from the welfare of
others, mediated by an altruism graph. Most importantly, we view altruism not
as immutable, but rather as a lever for promoting the common good. Our central
algorithmic question then revolves around the computational complexity of
modifying the altruism network to achieve desired public goods game investment

when a principal can fractionally modify the altruism network. While the
problem becomes in general intractable if the principal's actions are
all-or-nothing, we exhibit several tractable special cases.

persistence interval (bar) associates the bar with a concrete topological
representative, which provides means to effectively navigate back from the
barcode to the topological space. Among the possibly many, optimal persistent
cycles bring forth further information due to having guaranteed quality.
However, topological features usually go through variations in the lifecycle of
a bar which a single persistent cycle may not capture. Hence, for persistent
homology induced from PL functions, we propose levelset persistent cycles
consisting of a sequence of cycles that depict the evolution of homological
features from birth to death. Our definition is based on levelset zigzag
persistence which involves four types of persistence intervals as opposed to
the two types in standard persistence. For each of the four types, we present a
polynomial-time algorithm computing an optimal sequence of levelset persistent
$p$-cycles for the so-called weak $(p+1)$-pseudomanifolds. Given that optimal
cycle problems for homology are NP-hard in general, our results are useful in
practice because weak pseudomanifolds do appear in applications. Our algorithms
draw upon an idea of relating optimal cycles to min-cuts in a graph that we
exploited earlier for standard persistent cycles. Note that levelset zigzag
poses non-trivial challenges for the approach because a sequence of optimal
cycles instead of a single one needs to be computed in this case.

the system of distant qubits and the YIG strip to get SSE. Furthermore,
parameter regimes for which the shared displaced magnon bath can sustain
significant SSE against the local dephasing and decoherence of NV centers to

investigate the steady-state coherence (SSC) and explain the physical mechanism
of how delayed SSE appears following a rapid generation and sudden death of
entanglement using the interplay of decoherence-free subspace states, system

Therefore, we propose to augment short sequences while still preserving
original sequential correlations. We introduce a new framework for
\textbf{A}ugmenting \textbf{S}equential \textbf{Re}commendation with
\textbf{P}seudo-prior items~(ASReP). We firstly pre-train a transformer with
sequences in a reverse direction to predict prior items. Then, we use this

that has recently been used to obtain approximation algorithms for spin systems
on classes of bounded-degree graphs; examples include the ferromagnetic Potts
model on expanders and on the grid. One of the key ingredients in the analysis
of polymer models is controlling the growth rate of the number of polymers,
which has been typically achieved so far by invoking the bounded-degree
assumption. Nevertheless, this assumption is often restrictive and obstructs
the applicability of the method to more general graphs. For example, sparse
random graphs typically have bounded average degree and good expansion
properties, but they include vertices with unbounded degree, and therefore are
excluded from the current polymer-model framework.
  We develop a less restrictive framework for polymer models that relaxes the
standard bounded-degree assumption, by reworking the relevant polymer models
from the edge perspective. The edge perspective allows us to bound the growth
rate of the number of polymers in terms of the total degree of polymers, which
in turn can be related more easily to the expansion properties of the
underlying graph. To apply our methods, we consider random graphs with
unbounded degrees from a fixed degree sequence (with minimum degree at least 3)
and obtain approximation algorithms for the ferromagnetic Potts model, which is
a standard benchmark for polymer models. Our techniques also extend to more
general spin systems.

fermions and bosons, are gravitationally bound, regular, and static
configurations described within the coupled Einstein-Klein-Gordon-Euler
theoretical framework. The excited configurations are characterized by the
presence in the radial profile of the (complex, massive) scalar field -- the
bosonic piece -- of at least one node across the star. The dynamical emergence
of one such configuration from the accretion of a cloud of scalar field onto an
already-formed neutron star, was numerically revealed in our previous
investigation. Prompted by that finding we construct here equilibrium
configurations of excited fermion-boson stars and study their stability
properties using numerical-relativity simulations. In addition, we also analyze
their dynamical formation from generic, constraint-satisfying initial data.
Contrary to purely boson stars in the excited state, which are known to be
generically unstable, our study reveals the appearance of a cooperative
stabilization mechanism between the fermionic and bosonic constituents of those
excited-state mixed stars. While similar examples of stabilization mechanisms
have been recently discussed in the context of $\ell-$boson stars and
multi-field, multi-frequency boson stars, our results seem to indicate that the
stabilization mechanism is a purely gravitational effect and does not depend on
the type of matter of the companion star.

polynomial-time algorithms for solving them. An approach developed in computer
science for dealing with such problems is to devise approximation algorithms
that run in polynomial time, and provide solutions with provable guarantees on
their quality in terms of the optimal unknown solution. Recently, several
algorithms for the Ising-spin glass problem on a graph that provide different
approximation guarantees were introduced albeit without implementation. Also
recently, D-wave company constructed a physical realization of an adiabatic
quantum computer, and enabled researchers to access it. D-wave is particularly
suited for computing an approximation for the ground state of an Ising spin
glass on its chimera graph -- a graph with bounded degree. In this work, we
compare the performance of a recently developed approximation algorithm for
solving the Ising spin glass problem on graphs of bounded degree against the
D-wave computer. We also compared a heuristic tailored specifically to handle
the fixed D-wave chimera graph. D-wave computer was able to find better
approximations to all the random instances we studied. Furthermore the
convergence times of D-wave were also significantly better. These results
indicate the merit of D-wave computer under certain specific instances. More
broadly, our method is relevant to other performance comparison studies. We
suggest that it is important to compare the performance of quantum computers
not only against exact classical algorithms with exponential run-time scaling,

Wronskian isomorphism, namely $\mathrm{Sym}_m \mathrm{Sym}^\ell E \cong

proved by King, by showing that if $\nabla^\lambda$ is the Schur functor for
the partition $\lambda$ and $\lambda^\circ$ is the complement of $\lambda$ in a
rectangle with $\ell+1$ rows, then $\nabla^\lambda \mathrm{Sym}^\ell E \cong
\nabla^{\lambda^\circ} \mathrm{Sym}_\ell E$. To illustrate that the existence
of such `plethystic isomorphisms' is far from obvious, we end by proving that
the generalisation $\nabla^\lambda \mathrm{Sym}^\ell E \cong \nabla^{\lambda'}
\mathrm{Sym}^{\ell + \ell(\lambda') - \ell(\lambda)}E$ of the Wronskian
isomorphism, known to hold for a large class of partitions over the complex
field, does not generalise to fields of prime characteristic, even after
considering all possible dualities.

noetherian integral domain $\Lambda$ by a Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}$ (or, more
generally, by a coideal subalgebra of a Hopf algebra). They are generalizations
of Webster's principal flag orders. Examples include Cherednik algebras, as
well as examples from Hopf Galois theory. We also define spherical Galois
orders, which are the corresponding generalizations of principal Galois orders
introduced by the author.
  The main results are (1) for every maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $\Lambda$
of finite codimension, there exists a simple Harish-Chandra $F$-module in the
fiber of $\mathfrak{m}$; (2) for every character of $\Lambda$ we construct a
canonical simple Harish-Chandra module as a subquotient of the module of local

then the corresponding fiber of simple Harish-Chandra modules is finite; (4)
centralizers of symmetrizing idempotents are spherical Galois orders and every

However, those routing algorithms are design based upon specific assumptions.
The assumption makes existing algorithms suitable for specific environment

criteria to select the replication node. Too Frequently forwarding messages can
result in excessive packet loss and large buffer and network overhead. On the
other hand, less frequent transmission leads to a lower delivery ratio. In DTN
there is a trade-off off between delivery ratio and overhead. In this study, we
proposed context-adaptive reinforcement learning based routing(CARL-DTN)

social-tie strength, and real-time message context using fuzzy logic in the

simultaneously consider multiple sources of quantifiable uncertainties: (1)
parameter uncertainty due to randomness or lack of knowledge; (2) experimental
uncertainty due to measurement noise; (3) model uncertainty caused by
missing/incomplete physics and numerical approximation errors, and (4) code
uncertainty when surrogate models are used. In this paper, we propose a

  Inverse UQ quantifies the parameter uncertainties based on experimental data

model predictions will be able to integrate the results from inverse UQ and

collected to infer unknown parameters in the PDE. In order to obtain accurate
inferences, the collected data must be informative about the unknown
parameters. How to decide which data is most informative and how to efficiently
sample it, is the notoriously challenging task of optimal experimental design
(OED). In this context, the best, and often infeasible, scenario is when the
full input-to-output (ItO) map, i.e., an infinite amount of data, is available:
This is the typical setting in many theoretical inverse problems, which is used
to guarantee the unique parameter reconstruction. These two different settings
have created a gap between computational and theoretical inverse problems. In
this manuscript we aim to bridge this gap while circumventing the OED task.
This is achieved by exploiting the structures of the ItO data from the
underlying inverse problem, using the electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
problem as an example. We leverage the rank-structure of the EIT model, and
formulate the discretized ItO map, as an H-matrix. This suggests that one can
recover the full ItO matrix, with high probability, from a subset of its
entries sampled following the rank structure: The data in the diagonal blocks
is informative thus fully sampled, while data in the off-diagonal blocks can be
sub-sampled. This recovered ItO matrix is then utilized to represent the full
ItO map, allowing us to connect with the problem in the theoretical setting
where the unique reconstruction is guaranteed. This strategy achieves two
goals: I) it bridges the gap between the settings for the numerical and
theoretical inverse problems and II) it improves the quality of computational
inverse solutions. We detail the theory for the EIT model, and provide
numerical verification to both EIT and optical tomography problems

the complex relationships between these factors, and we put forward the idea of
neo-humanism, a cultural movement grounded on evidence from quality-of-life
studies. The movement proposes a new culture leading towards a socially and
environmentally sustainable future. Specifically, neo-humanism suggests that
prioritizing well-being by, for instance, promoting social relations, would
benefit the environment, enable collective action to address public issues,
which in turn positively affects productivity and health, among other
behavioral outcomes, and thereby instills a virtuous cycle. Arguably, such a
society would have been better endowed to cope with COVID-19, and possibly even
prevented the pandemic. Neo-humanism proposes a world in which the well-being
of people comes before the well-being of markets, in which promoting
cooperation and social relations represents the starting point for better

explores learning embedding functions that map a human's low-dimensional inputs

high-dimensional actions than available low-dimensional inputs. To extract the
correct action and maximally assist their human controller, robots must reason
over their context: for example, pressing a joystick down when interacting with
a coffee cup indicates a different action than when interacting with knife. In
this work, we develop assistive robots that condition their latent embeddings
on visual inputs. We explore a spectrum of visual encoders and show that
incorporating object detectors pretrained on small amounts of cheap,
easy-to-collect structured data enables i) accurately and robustly recognizing
the current context and ii) generalizing control embeddings to new objects and

  Learning for a Target Population",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning individualized treatment rules (ITRs) is an important topic in
precision medicine. Current literature mainly focuses on deriving ITRs from a
single source population. We consider the observational data setting when the
source population differs from a target population of interest. We assume
subject covariates are available from both populations, but treatment and
outcome data are only available from the source population. Although adjusting
for differences between source and target populations can potentially lead to
an improved ITR for the target population, it can substantially increase the
variability in ITR estimation. To address this dilemma, we develop a weighting
framework that aims to tailor an ITR for a given target population and protect
against high variability due to superfluous covariate shift adjustments. Our
method seeks covariate balance over a nonparametric function class
characterized by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and can improve many ITR
learning methods that rely on weights. We show that the proposed method
encompasses importance weights and the so-called overlap weights as two extreme
cases, allowing for a better bias-variance trade-off in between. Numerical
examples demonstrate that the use of our weighting method can greatly improve
ITR estimation for the target population compared with other weighting methods.

10^7 M_{\odot}$ at lens redshift about half that of the GRB, with a time delay
in the order of $10$ seconds. Current GRB observatories are capable of
resolving and constraining this lensing scenario if the above conditions are

with previous work in a lower mass range ($10^2 - 10^3 M_{\odot}$), which gave

new H{\alpha} and archival broad-band images of UGC 8839 to similar data for
four other spiral galaxies. We conclude that the extreme off-axis star
formation in UGC 8839 is likely due to a hyper-stable disc that is dark matter
dominated at all radii, with the Toomre parameter reaching a minimum only in
the extreme outer disc. Using analysis strategies designed to be particularly
insensitive to the pitfalls of low-surface brightness objects and small number
statistics, we determine that the presence of this complex in UGC 8839 is not
exceptional when the HII region luminosity function is modelled by a power law,
suggesting that it is a native structure and not a merging satellite. However,
we find that the entire population of HII regions in UGC 8839 shows a
preference for larger galactocentric radii when compared to HII regions in the
other galaxies in our sample. UGC 8839 dramatically highlights the relationship
between the baryonic/dark matter ratio and disk stability. A three-body
interaction, similar to a scaled-down version of the interaction suspected to
be responsible for Malin 1, is consistent with the extreme outer disk star
formation that we see in the extended disk of UGC 8839.

directions. Other sight-lines are visible to us through studies of the
Homunculus reflection nebula. The coronagraph appears to be vanishing,
decreasing the extinction towards the central star, and causing the star's
secular brightening. In contrast, the Homunculus remains at an almost constant
brightness. The coronagraph primarily suppresses the stellar continuum, to a
lesser extent the wind lines, and not the circumstellar emission lines. This
explains why the absolute values of equivalent widths (EWs) of the emission
lines in our direct view are larger than those seen in reflected by the
Homunculus, why the direct view absolute EWs are decreasing with time, and why
lower-excitation spectral wind lines formed at larger radii (e.g. FeII 4585A)
decrease in intensity at a faster pace than higher excitation lines that form
closer to the star (e.g. H\delta). Our main result is that the star, despite
its 10-fold brightening over two decades, is relatively stable. A vanishing

law of large numbers and central limit theorem by restricting the inhomogeneous
solution process to periodic times. The results are independent of the strength
of the noise and hold true for any value of viscosity with a lower bound
$\nu_1$ characterized by the Grashof number $G_1$ associated with the
deterministic forcing. In the laminar case, there is a larger lower bound
$\nu_2$ of the viscosity characterized by the Grashof number $G_2$ associated
with both the deterministic and random forcing. We prove that in this laminar
case, the system has trivial dynamics for any viscosity larger than $\nu_2$ by
demonstrating the existence of a unique globally exponentially stable random
periodic solution that supports the unique periodic invariant measure.

one. In this paper, we propose recommendations for presenting dark matter
direct detection results particularly suited for weak-scale dark matter
searches, although we believe the spirit of the recommendations can apply more
broadly to searches for other dark matter candidates, such as very light dark
matter or axions. To translate experimental data into a final published result,
direct detection collaborations must make a series of choices in their
analysis, ranging from how to model astrophysical parameters to how to make
statistical inferences based on observed data. While many collaborations follow
a standard set of recommendations in some areas, for example the expected flux
of dark matter particles (to a large degree based on a paper from Lewin and
Smith in 1995), in other areas, particularly in statistical inference, they
have taken different approaches, often from result to result by the same
collaboration. We set out a number of recommendations on how to apply the now
commonly used Profile Likelihood Ratio method to direct detection data. In
addition, updated recommendations for the Standard Halo Model astrophysical
parameters and relevant neutrino fluxes are provided. The authors of this note
include members of the DAMIC, DarkSide, DARWIN, DEAP, LZ, NEWS-G, PandaX, PICO,

and variance) of excavated material during excavation by aggregating the prior
moments of the grade blocks around the given bucket dig location. By modelling
the moments as random probability density functions (pdf) at sampled locations,
a formulation of the sums of Gaussian based uncertainty estimation is presented
that jointly estimates the location pdfs, as well as the prior values for
uncertainty coming from ore body knowledge (obk) sub block models. The moments
calculated at each random location is a single Gaussian and they are the
components of Gaussian mixture distribution. The overall uncertainty of the
excavated material at the given bucket location is represented by the Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM) and therefore moment matching method is proposed to
estimate the moments of the reduced GMM. The method was tested in a region at a
Pilbara iron ore deposit situated in the Brockman Iron Formation of the
Hamersley Province, Western Australia, and suggests a frame work to quantify
the uncertainty in the excavated material that hasn't been studied anywhere in
the literature yet.

distributed participants to collaboratively learn a commonly-shared model while
holding data locally. However, it is also faced with expensive communication

of access to global data. In this paper, we investigate a practical distributed
learning scenario where multiple downstream tasks (e.g., classifiers) could be
efficiently learned from dynamically-updated and non-iid distributed data
sources while providing local data privatization. We introduce a new
distributed/collaborative learning scheme to address communication overhead via
latent compression, leveraging global data while providing privatization of
local data without additional cost due to encryption or perturbation. This
scheme divides learning into (1) informative feature encoding, and transmitting
the latent representation of local data to address communication overhead; (2)
downstream tasks centralized at the server using the encoded codes gathered
from each node to address computing overhead. Besides, a disentanglement
strategy is applied to address the privatization of sensitive components of
local data. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and speech datasets.
The results demonstrate that downstream tasks on the compact latent
representations with the privatization of local data can achieve comparable
accuracy to centralized learning.

  In this paper, we consider the case where any constant fraction of the qubits

a computational problem that can be solved in constant depth by a quantum

requires logarithmic depth with bounded fan-in classical circuits. This gives
another compelling evidence of the computational power of quantum shallow
circuits.

resonant spin echo technique which allows one to measure time correlation
scattering functions in materials by implementing radio-frequency (RF)
intensity modulation at the sample and detector. The technique avoids neutron
spin manipulation between the sample and the detector, and thus could find
applications in cases where the sample depolarizes the neutron beam. However,
the finite sample size creates a variance in path length between the locations
where scattering and detection happens, which limits the contrast in intensity
modulation that one can detect, in particular towards long correlation times or
large scattering angles. We propose a modification to the MIEZE setup that will
enable one to extend those detection limits to longer times and larger angles.
We use Monte Carlo simulations of a neutron scattering beam line to show that,
by tilting the RF flippers in the primary spectrometer with respect to the beam
direction, one can shape the wave front of the intensity modulation at the
sample to compensate for the path variance from the sample and the detector.
The simulation results indicate that this change enables one to operate a MIEZE
instrument at much increased RF frequencies, thus improving the effective
energy resolution of the technique. The simulations show that for an incident
beam with maximum divergence of 0.33$^\circ$, the maximum Fourier time can be
increased by a factor of 3.

Here, we show that this weaker assumption is not sufficient for stability by
constructing a family of examples where the number of jobs in the network
increases to infinity over time.
  This behavior contrasts with that for the other classical disciplines:
processor sharing (PS), infinite server (IS), and first-in, first-out (FIFO),
which are stable under general conditions on the renewals of external arrivals.
Together with LIFO, PS and IS constitute the classical symmetric disciplines;
with the inclusion of FIFO, these disciplines constitute the classical
homogeneous disciplines. Our examples show that a general theory for stability

implementation phases of the system development life cycle. Such a model
requires a firm grasp of the abstract principles on which a system is based, as
well as an understanding of the high-level nature of the representation of
entities and processes. In this context, models can have distinct architectural
characteristics. This paper discusses model multiplicity (e.g., unified
modeling language [UML]), model singularity (e.g., object-process methodology
[OPM], thinging machine [TM]), and a heterogeneous model that involves
multiplicity and singularity. The basic idea of model multiplicity is that it
is not possible to present all views in a single representation, so a number of
models are used, with each model representing a different view. The model
singularity approach uses only a single unified model that assimilates its
subsystems into one system. This paper is concerned with current approaches,
especially in software engineering texts, where multimodal UML is introduced as
the general-purpose modeling language (i.e., UML is modeling). In such a
situation, we suggest raising the issue of multiplicity versus singularity in
modeling. This would foster a basic appreciation of the UML advantages and
difficulties that may be faced during modeling, especially in the educational
setting. Furthermore, we advocate the claim that a multiplicity of views does
not necessitate a multiplicity of models. The model singularity approach can
represent multiple views (static, behavior) without resorting to a collection
of multiple models with various notations. We present an example of such a
model where the static representation is developed first. Then, the dynamic
view and behavioral representations are built by incorporating a decomposition
strategy interleaved with the notion of time.

infected patient in the last week""), and the corresponding users notified.
However, there are significant performance issues associated with existing
protocols. The underlying searchable encryption primitives required to perform
the matching on ciphertexts are expensive, and without a proper encoding of
locations and search predicates, the performance can degrade a lot. In this
paper, we propose a novel method for variable-length location encoding based on
Huffman codes. By controlling the length required to represent encrypted
locations and the corresponding matching predicates, we are able to
significantly speed up performance. We provide a theoretical analysis of the
gain achieved by using Huffman codes, and we show through extensive experiments
that the improvement compared with fixed-length encoding methods is
substantial.

in a replication probability that is proportional to the absorbed work from the

our auction scheme is more efficient with lower cost, making it feasible in

to develop recommendation systems to assist people targeting better songs with
fewer efforts. As the interactions between users and songs naturally construct
a complex network, community detection approaches can be applied to reveal
users' potential interests on songs by grouping relevant users & songs to the
same community. However, as the types of interaction could be heterogeneous, it
challenges conventional community detection methods designed originally for
homogeneous networks. Although there are existing works on heterogeneous
community detection, they are mostly task-driven approaches and not feasible
for specific music recommendation. In this paper, we propose a genetic based
approach to learn an edge-type usefulness distribution (ETUD) for all
edge-types in heterogeneous music networks. ETUD can be regarded as a linear
function to project all edges to the same latent space and make them
comparable. Therefore a heterogeneous network can be converted to a homogeneous
one where those conventional methods are eligible to use. We validate the
proposed model on a heterogeneous music network constructed from an online
music streaming service. Results show that for conventional methods, ETUD can
help to detect communities significantly improving music recommendation

current with a finite length of the junction for all the singlet-triplet

detection have been upgraded by replacing non-end-to-end components, such as
removing non-maximum suppression by training with a set loss based on bipartite

due to its significantly higher output dimensions compared to object detection.
In this paper, we propose an instance segmentation Transformer, termed ISTR,

low-dimensional mask embeddings, and matches them with ground truth mask
embeddings for the set loss. Besides, ISTR concurrently conducts detection and

lens of counting and show that framing $F_0$ estimation as a special case of
#DNF counting allows us to obtain a general recipe for a rich class of
streaming problems, which had been subjected to case-specific analysis in prior
works. In particular, our view yields a state-of-the art algorithm for

aqueous methane system. We estimate the vibrational density of states and also
the infrared spectral density. We compare the methane-water data with the bulk

automation in the form of IoT apps. IoT apps subscribe to events and upon
receipt, transmit actuation commands which trigger a set of actuators. Events
and actuation commands follow paths in the IoT ecosystem such as
sensor-to-edge, edge-to-cloud, and cloud-to-actuator, with different network
and processing delays between these connections. Significant delays may occur
especially when an IoT system cloud interacts with other clouds. Due to this
variation in delays, the cloud may receive events in an incorrect order, and in
turn, devices may receive and actuate misordered commands. In this paper, we
first study eight major IoT platforms and show that they do not make strong
guarantees on event orderings to address these issues. We then analyze the
end-to-end interactions among IoT components, from the creation of an event to
the invocation of a command. From this, we identify and formalize the root
causes of misorderings in events and commands leading to undesired states. We
deploy 23 apps in a simulated smart home containing 35 IoT devices to evaluate
the misordering problem. Our experiments demonstrate a high number of
misordered events and commands that occur through different interaction paths.
Through this effort, we reveal the root and extent of the misordering problem

shopping. The algorithm is based on the perspective that, since the grocery
items are usually bought in bulk, a grocery recommender system should be
capable of recommending the items in bulk. The algorithm figures out the
possible dishes a user may cook based on the items added to the basket and
recommends the ingredients accordingly. Our algorithm does not depend on the
user ratings. Customers usually do not have the patience to rate the groceries
they purchase. Therefore, algorithms that are not dependent on user ratings
need to be designed. Instead of using a brute force search, this algorithm
limits the search space to a set of only a few probably food categories. Each
food category consists of several food subcategories. For example, ""fried rice""
and ""biryani"" are food subcategories that belong to the food category ""rice"".
For each food category, items are ranked according to how well they can
differentiate a food subcategory. To each food subcategory in the activated
search space, this algorithm attaches a score. The score is calculated based on
the rank of the items added to the basket. Once the score exceeds a threshold
value, its corresponding subcategory gets activated. The algorithm then uses a
basket-to-recipe similarity measure to identify the best recipe matches within
the activated subcategories only. This reduces the search space to a great
extent. We may argue that this algorithm is similar to the content-based
recommender system in some sense, but it does not suffer from the limitations
like limited content, over-specialization, or the new user problem.

reason for this may be that the sources are located in different environments
resolved by the interferometric observations: B35A$-$2, B35A$-$3 and in
particular B35A$-$5 are situated in a shocked region plausibly affected by
sputtering and heating impacting the submillimeter dust emission pattern, while

the radius of the circumcircle of every triangular element are asymptotically

ensuring that every triangular element on a facet satisfies Gabriel's

multiple facets intersect, Gabriel's condition is satisfied by a modified

distributionally robust risk map (DR-risk map), for a mobile robot operating in
a learning-enabled environment. Given the robot's position, the map aims to
reliably assess the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of collision with
obstacles whose movements are inferred by Gaussian process regression (GPR).
Unfortunately, the inferred distribution is subject to errors, making it
difficult to accurately evaluate the CVaR of collision. To overcome this
challenge, this tool measures the risk under the worst-case distribution in a
so-called ambiguity set that characterizes allowable distribution errors. To
resolve the infinite-dimensionality issue inherent in the construction of the
DR-risk map, we derive a tractable semidefinite programming formulation that
provides an upper bound of the risk, exploiting techniques from modern
distributionally robust optimization. As a concrete application for motion
planning, a distributionally robust RRT* algorithm is considered using the risk
map that addresses distribution errors caused by GPR. Furthermore, a motion
control method is devised using the DR-risk map in a learning-based model

frequency domain where a network of discontinuities is illuminated by a set of
total body forces and fluid volumetric sources, while monitoring the induced
(acoustic and elastic) scattered waves in an arbitrary near-field
configuration. A thin-layer approximation is deployed to capture the rough and
multiphase nature of interfaces whose spatially varying hydro-mechanical
properties are a priori unknown. In this setting, the well-posedness analysis
of the forward problem yields the admissibility conditions for the contact
parameters. In light of which, the poroelastic scattering operator and its
first and second factorizations are introduced and their mathematical
properties are carefully examined. It is shown that the non-selfadjoint nature
of the Biot system leads to an intrinsically asymmetric factorization of the
scattering operator which may be symmetrized at certain limits. These results
furnish a robust framework for systematic design of regularized and convex cost

demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the location-of-recording to a
certain geographical resolution using power signal recordings containing strong
ENF traces. To this purpose, a high-passed version of an ENF signal is
extracted and it is demonstrated that the correlation between two such signals,
extracted from recordings made in different geographical locations within the
same grid, decreases as the distance between the recording locations increases.
We harness this property of correlation in the ENF signals to propose
trilateration based localization methods, which pinpoint the unknown location
of a recording while using some known recording locations as anchor locations.
We also discuss the challenges that need to be overcome in order to extend this

utilize the existing framework for Hermitian systems into the classification of

a general class of geometric structures, which we call (weighted) shape graphs,
that allows for shape registration with partial matching constraints and
topological inconsistencies. Weighted shape graphs are the union of an
arbitrary number of component curves in Euclidean space with potential
connectivity constraints between some of their boundary points, together with a
weight function defined on each component curve. The framework of higher order
invariant Sobolev metrics is particularly well suited for constructing notions
of distances and geodesics between unparametrized curves. The main difficulty
in adapting this framework to the setting of shape graphs is the absence of
topological consistency, which typically results in an inadequate search for an
exact matching between two shape graphs. We overcome this hurdle by defining an
inexact variational formulation of the matching problem between (weighted)
shape graphs of any underlying topology, relying on the convenient measure
representation given by varifolds to relax the exact matching constraint. We
then prove the existence of minimizers to this variational problem when we
choose Sobolev metrics of sufficient regularity and a total variation (TV)
regularization on the weight function. We propose a numerical optimization
approach which adapts the smoothed fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding

can be solved in many different ways, such as complex reinforcement learning or
robotics tasks. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the choice of
feature descriptors (FDs) quantifying the similarity in behaviour of the
solutions. While FDs usually needs to be hand-designed, recent studies have
proposed ways to define them automatically by using feature extraction
techniques, such as PCA or Auto-Encoders, to learn a representation of the
problem from previously explored solutions. Here, we extend these approaches to
more complex problems which cannot be efficiently explored by relying only on a
single representation but require instead a set of diverse and complementary
representations. We describe MC-AURORA, a Quality-Diversity approach that
optimises simultaneously several collections of solutions, each with a

observed in a variety of sources. The ubiquitous presence of pulsations clearly
indicates that thermal photons either come from a limited area, possibly heated
by some external mechanism, or from the entire (cooling) surface but with an
inhomogeneous temperature distribution. In a NS the thermal map is shaped by
the magnetic field topology, since heat flows in the crust mostly along the
magnetic field lines. Self-consistent surface thermal maps can hence be
produced by simulating the coupled magnetic and thermal evolution of the star.
We compute the evolution of the neutron star crust in three dimensions for
different initial configurations of the magnetic field and use the ensuing
thermal surface maps to derive the spectrum and the pulse profile as seen by an
observer at infinity, accounting for general-relativistic effects. In
particular, we compare cases with a high degree of symmetry with inherently 3D
ones, obtained by adding a quadrupole to the initial dipolar field. Axially
symmetric fields result in rather small pulsed fractions ($\lesssim 5\%$),
while more complex configurations produce higher pulsed fractions, up to
$\sim25\%$. We find that the spectral properties of our axisymmetric model are
close to those of the bright isolated NS RX~J1856.5-3754 at an evolutionary
time comparable with the inferred dynamical age of the source.

deep-learning algorithms (Goodfellow et al. 2016), or combining various methods
of computational intelligence, such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and
case-based reasoning (Medsker 2012). One of the implicit promises that underlie
these advancements is that machines will 1 day be capable of performing complex
tasks or may even supersede humans in performing these tasks. This triggers new
heated debates of when machines will ultimately replace humans (McAfee and
Brynjolfsson 2017). While previous research has proved that AI performs well in
some clearly defined tasks such as playing chess, playing Go or identifying
objects on images, it is doubted that the development of an artificial general
intelligence (AGI) which is able to solve multiple tasks at the same time can
be achieved in the near future (e.g., Russell and Norvig 2016). Moreover, the
use of AI to solve complex business problems in organizational contexts occurs
scarcely, and applications for AI that solve complex problems remain mainly in
laboratory settings instead of being implemented in practice. Since the road to
AGI is still a long one, we argue that the most likely paradigm for the
division of labor between humans and machines in the next decades is Hybrid
Intelligence. This concept aims at using the complementary strengths of human
intelligence and AI, so that they can perform better than each of the two could

parallel concatenated codes (PCCs) with a fraction of information bits repeated
before the PCC encoding. GSC-PCCs can be seen as a generalization of the
original spatially coupled parallel concatenated convolutional codes (SC-PCCs)
proposed by Moloudi et al. [1]. To characterize the asymptotic performance of
GSC-PCCs, we derive the corresponding density evolution equations and compute
their decoding thresholds. We show that the proposed codes have some nice
properties such as threshold saturation and that their decoding thresholds
improve with the repetition factor $q$. Most notably, our analysis suggests
that the proposed codes asymptotically approach the capacity as $q$ tends to
infinity with any given constituent convolutional code.

immediate surroundings of the post-giant and most likely post-common-envelope
star HD101584 using high-angular-resolution ALMA observations. The
circumstellar environment of this object is rich in different molecular
species, but we find no viable identifications in terms of molecular lines.
  We aim to determine whether or not these lines can be attributed to the
Rydberg transitions -- X30alpha and X26alpha -- of neutral atoms of elements
heavier than carbon.
  A simple model in strict local thermodynamic equilibrium for a warm-gas
environment of the moderate-temperature star (T_eff about 8500 K) was
constructed to corroborate our findings. A geometrically thin, disc-like
geometry seen face-on was chosen and a distance of 1 kpc.
  The observed flux densities of the lines and the continuum at 232 and 354 GHz
can be reproduced using 10^(-3) M_sun of gas at a temperature of about 2800 K
and a hydrogen density of about 10^(12) cm(-3), assuming solar abundances for
the elements. The gas lies within a distance of about 5 au from the star
(assuming a distance of 1 kpc). The ionisation fraction is low, about
3x10^(-5). The origin of such a region is not clear, but it may be related to a
common-envelope-evolution phase. With these conditions, the line emissions are
dominated by Rydberg transitions within the stable isotopes of Mg. A turbulent
velocity field in the range 5.5 - 7.5 km s^(-1) is required to fit the Gaussian
line shapes. An upper limit to the average magnetic field in the line-emitting
region of 1G is set using the Zeeman effect in these lines.
  We speculate that Rydberg transitions of heavy elements may be an interesting
probe for the close-in environments of other moderate-temperature objects like
AGB stars, red supergiants, yellow hypergiants, and binaries of various types.

The generated samples can act as a recommendation for end-users to achieve

decision process (MDP) problems. Clipped Double Q-learning, as an effective
variant of Double Q-learning, employs the clipped double estimator to
approximate the maximum expected action value. Due to the underestimation bias
of the clipped double estimator, performance of clipped Double Q-learning may
be degraded in some stochastic environments. In this paper, in order to reduce
the underestimation bias, we propose an action candidate based clipped double
estimator for Double Q-learning. Specifically, we first select a set of elite
action candidates with the high action values from one set of estimators. Then,
among these candidates, we choose the highest valued action from the other set
of estimators. Finally, we use the maximum value in the second set of
estimators to clip the action value of the chosen action in the first set of
estimators and the clipped value is used for approximating the maximum expected
action value. Theoretically, the underestimation bias in our clipped Double
Q-learning decays monotonically as the number of the action candidates
decreases. Moreover, the number of action candidates controls the trade-off
between the overestimation and underestimation biases. In addition, we also
extend our clipped Double Q-learning to continuous action tasks via
approximating the elite continuous action candidates. We empirically verify
that our algorithm can more accurately estimate the maximum expected action
value on some toy environments and yield good performance on several benchmark
problems.

primarily on making aspects of intangible software product artefacts more
evident. While undoubtedly useful, this focus has meant that software process
visualisation has received far less attention. Objective: This paper presents
Conceptual Visualisation, a novel SV approach that builds on the well-known
CodeCity metaphor by situating software code artefacts alongside their software
development processes, in order to link and synchronise these typically
separate components. Method: While the majority of prior SV research has
focused on representing what is already available in the code (i.e., the
implementation) or information derived from it (i.e., various metrics), the
presented approach instead makes the design concepts and original developers'
intentions -- both significant sources of information in terms of software
development and maintenance -- readily and contextually available in a
visualisation environment that tightly integrates the code artefacts with their
original functional requirements and development activity. Results: Our
approach has been implemented in a prototype tool called ScrumCity with the
proof of concept being demonstrated using six real-world open source systems. A
preliminary case study has further been carried out with real world data.
Conclusion: Conceptual Visualisation, as implemented in ScrumCity, shows early
promise in enabling developers and managers (and potentially other
stakeholders) to traverse and explore multiple aspects of software product and
process artefacts in a synchronised manner, achieving traceability between the
two.

challenges with its tremendous potential returns accompanying high risks. The
high volatility of Bitcoin and the complex factors affecting them make the
study of effective price forecasting methods of great practical importance to
financial investors and researchers worldwide. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach called MRC-LSTM, which combines a Multi-scale Residual
Convolutional neural network (MRC) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to
implement Bitcoin closing price prediction. Specifically, the Multi-scale
residual module is based on one-dimensional convolution, which is not only
capable of adaptive detecting features of different time scales in multivariate
time series, but also enables the fusion of these features. LSTM has the
ability to learn long-term dependencies in series, which is widely used in
financial time series forecasting. By mixing these two methods, the model is
able to obtain highly expressive features and efficiently learn trends and
interactions of multivariate time series. In the study, the impact of external
factors such as macroeconomic variables and investor attention on the Bitcoin
price is considered in addition to the trading information of the Bitcoin
market. We performed experiments to predict the daily closing price of Bitcoin
(USD), and the experimental results show that MRC-LSTM significantly
outperforms a variety of other network structures. Furthermore, we conduct
additional experiments on two other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Litecoin, to
further confirm the effectiveness of the MRC-LSTM in short-term forecasting for
multivariate time series of cryptocurrencies.

that only requires that it is hard to sample a collision $(x,y)$ where $x$ is
uniformly random and $y$ is uniformly random conditioned on colliding with $x$.
The notion lies between one-wayness and collision resistance, but its exact
power is still not well-understood. On one hand, distributional collision
resistant hash functions cannot be built from one-way functions in a black-box
way, which may suggest that they are stronger. On the other hand, so far, they
have not yielded any applications beyond one-way functions.
  Assuming distributional collision resistant hash functions, we construct
\emph{constant-round} statistically hiding commitment scheme. Such commitments
are not known based on one-way functions and are impossible to obtain from
one-way functions in a black-box way. Our construction relies on the reduction
from inaccessible entropy generators to statistically hiding commitments by
Haitner et al.\ (STOC '09). In the converse direction, we show that two-message
statistically hiding commitments imply distributional collision resistance,
thereby establishing a loose equivalence between the two notions.
  A corollary of the first result is that constant-round statistically hiding
commitments are implied by average-case hardness in the class $SZK$ (which is
known to imply distributional collision resistance). This implication seems to
be folklore, but to the best of our knowledge has not been proven explicitly.
We provide yet another proof of this implication, which is arguably more direct
than the one going through distributional collision resistance.

and the spin-valley coupling as a function of the electromagnetic fields in a
Si/SiGe quantum dot spin qubit. We demonstrate that our theory can
quantitatively reproduce and explain the result of experimental measurements

  Investigating the sample dependence of spin relaxation, we find that at
certain conditions for a disordered quantum dot, the spin-valley coupling
vanishes. This, in turn, completely blocks the valley-induced qubit decay. We
show that the presence of interface steps can in general give rise to a
strongly anisotropic behavior of the spin relaxation time. Remarkably, by
properly tuning the gate-induced out-of-plane electric field, it is possible to
turn the spin-valley hotspot into a ``coldspot"" at which the relaxation time is
significantly prolonged and where the spin relaxation time is additionally
first-order insensitive to the fluctuations of the magnetic field. This
electrical tunability enables on-demand fast qubit reset and initialization

  its extremal properties",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effects like selection in evolution as well as fertility inheritance in the
development of populations can lead to a higher degree of asymmetry in
evolutionary trees than expected under a null hypothesis. To identify and
quantify such influences, various balance indices were proposed in the
phylogenetic literature and have been in use for decades.
  However, so far no balance index was based on the number of \emph{symmetry
nodes}, even though symmetry nodes play an important role in other areas of
mathematical phylogenetics and despite the fact that symmetry nodes are a quite
natural way to measure balance or symmetry of a given tree.
  The aim of this manuscript is thus twofold: First, we will introduce the
\emph{symmetry nodes index} as an index for measuring balance of phylogenetic
trees and analyze its extremal properties. We also show that this index can be
calculated in linear time. This new index turns out to be a generalization of a
simple and well-known balance index, namely the \emph{cherry index}, as well as
a specialization of another, less established, balance index, namely
\emph{Rogers' $J$ index}. Thus, it is the second objective of the present
manuscript to compare the new symmetry nodes index to these two indices and to
underline its advantages. In order to do so, we will derive some extremal
properties of the cherry index and Rogers' $J$ index along the way and thus
complement existing studies on these indices. Moreover, we used the programming
language \textsf{R} to implement all three indices in the software package
\textsf{symmeTree}, which has been made publicly available.

which we name higher-order tensor ICA (HOT-ICA). HOT-ICA is a tensor ICA that
makes effective use of the signal categories represented by the axes of a
separating tensor. Conventional tensor ICAs, such as multilinear ICA (MICA)
based on Tucker decomposition, do not fully utilize the high dimensionality of
tensors because the matricization in MICA nullifies the tensor axial
categorization. In this paper, we deal with multiple-target signal separation
in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system to detect respiration
and heartbeat. HOT-ICA realizes high robustness in learning by incorporating
path information, i.e., the physical-measurement categories on which
transmitting/receiving antennas were used. In numerical-physical experiments,
our HOT-ICA system effectively separate the bio-signals successfully even in an
obstacle-affecting environment, which is usually a difficult task. The results
demonstrate the significance of the HOT-ICA, which keeps the tensor
categorization unchanged for full utilization of the high-dimensionality of the
separation tensor.

the first one, the load aggregate provides synthetic inertia by varying its
active power demand proportionally to the frequency rate of change; in the
second one, the load aggregate provides primary frequency regulation by varying
its power demand proportionally to frequency; in the third one, the two
services are combined. The performances of the proposed control solutions are
analyzed in the forecasted scenario of the electric power system of Sardinia in
2030, characterized by a huge installation of wind and photovoltaic generation
and no coil and combustible oil power plants. The considered load aggregate is
composed by domestic refrigerators and water heaters. Results prove the
effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that, in the particular case of
refrigerators and water heaters, the contribution to the frequency regulation
is more significant in the case of positive frequency variations. Finally, the
correlation between the regulation performances and the level of penetration of
the load aggregate with respect to the system total load is evaluated.

discrete numerical models often suffer from excessive computing expenses when
used for application-scale considerations. More efficient multiscale simulation
procedures are thus called for, capable of capturing the most significant
microscopic phenomena while being computationally tractable. Two broad classes
of methods are available in the literature. The first class considers the
fully-resolved discrete system, which is subsequently reduced through suitable
mathematical tools such as projection and reduced integration. The second class
first homogenizes the discrete system into an equivalent continuum formulation,
into which the main phenomena are added through specific enrichments. This
paper provides a thorough comparison of the two different modeling philosophies
in terms of their theory, accuracy, and performance. To this goal, two typical
representatives are adopted: the Quasicontinuum method for the first class, and
an effective continuum with an embedded cohesive zone model for the second
class. Two examples are employed to demonstrate capabilities and limitations of
both approaches: dislocation propagation and pile-up against a coherent phase
boundary, and a three-point bending test of a concrete specimen with crack
propagation. In both cases, the accuracy of the two methods is compared against
the fully-resolved discrete reference model. It is shown that whereas continuum
models with embedded cohesive zones offer good performance to accuracy ratios,
they might fail to capture unexpected mechanical behavior. The Quasicontinuum
method offers more flexibility at a higher computational cost.

receive the same output) when one third of the parties, or more, might be
corrupted. Assuming all parties are connected via a peer-to-peer network, but
no broadcast channel (nor a secure setup phase) is available, we prove the
following characterization:
  1) A symmetric $n$-party functionality can be securely computed facing
$n/3\le t<n/2$ corruptions (\ie honest majority), if and only if it is
\emph{$(n-2t)$-dominated}; a functionality is $k$-dominated, if \emph{any}

  2) Assuming the existence of one-way functions, a symmetric $n$-party
functionality can be securely computed facing $t\ge n/2$ corruptions (\ie no
honest majority), if and only if it is $1$-dominated and can be securely
computed with broadcast.
  It follows that, in case a third of the parties might be corrupted, broadcast
is necessary for securely computing non-dominated functionalities (in which
""small"" subsets of the inputs cannot determine the output), including, as
interesting special cases, the Boolean XOR and coin-flipping functionalities.

non-overlapping composite bosons in the strong coupling limit has been a
long-standing issue of interacting many-body fermion systems. Recently, FeSe
semimetal with hole and electron bands emerged as a high-$T_{\rm c}$
superconductor located in the BCS-BEC crossover regime, owing to its very small
Fermi energies. In FeSe, however, an ordinary BCS-like heat-capacity jump is
observed at $T_{\rm c}$, posing a fundamental question on the characteristics
of the BCS-BEC crossover. Here we report on high-resolution heat capacity,
magnetic torque, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements in
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$. Upon entering the tetragonal phase at $x>0.17$, where
nematic order is suppressed, $T_{\rm c}$ discontinuously decreases. In this
phase, highly non-mean-field behaviors consistent with BEC-like pairing are
found in the thermodynamic quantities with giant superconducting fluctuations
extending far above $T_{\rm c}$, implying the change of pairing nature.
Moreover, the pseudogap formation, which is expected in BCS-BEC crossover of
single-band superconductors, is not observed in the tunneling spectra. These
results illuminate highly unusual features of the superconducting states in the
crossover regime with multiband electronic structure and competing electronic
instabilities.

many-body systems: Entanglement measures not only quantify the possible use of
these systems in quantum information protocols, but also shed light on their
physics. However, exact analytical results remain scarce, especially for
systems out of equilibrium. In this work we examine a paradigmatic
one-dimensional fermionic system that consists of a uniform tight-binding chain
with an arbitrary scattering region near its center, which is subject to a DC
bias voltage at zero temperature. The system is thus held in a current-carrying
nonequilibrium steady state, which can nevertheless be described by a pure
quantum state. Using a generalization of the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture, we
present an exact calculation of the bipartite entanglement entropy of a
subsystem with its complement, and show that the scaling of entanglement with
the length of the subsystem is highly unusual, containing both a volume-law
linear term and a logarithmic term. The linear term is related to imperfect
transmission due to scattering, and provides a generalization of the
Levitov-Lesovik full counting statistics formula. The logarithmic term arises
from the Fermi discontinuities in the distribution function. Our analysis also
produces an exact expression for the particle-number-resolved entanglement. We
find that although to leading order entanglement equipartition applies, the
first term breaking it grows with the size of the subsystem, a novel behavior
not observed in previously studied systems. We apply our general results to a
concrete model of a tight-binding chain with a single impurity site, and show
that the analytical expressions are in good agreement with numerical
calculations. The analytical results are further generalized to accommodate the
case of multiple scattering regions.

of neglecting short-term relaxation modes of the body. However, the authors
still do not solve the governing equations in full, because they make
approximations to the Liouville equation (LE). In this paper I use a time
domain approach and for previously studied test loads I solve both the
relaxation of the body and the LE in full. I also compute the energy balance of
true polar wander (TPW) in order to analyze the existing LE approximations. For
fast rotating bodies such as the Earth, I show that the rotation axis is always
aligned with the maximum principal axis of inertia (w||MMOI) once free
oscillations are damped. The w||MMOI assumption is also re-derived
theoretically. Contrary to previous beliefs, I demonstrate that it is not
necessarily linked to the quasi-fluid simplification of the body's viscoelastic
response to loading and rotation, but that it is an expression of neglecting
the Coriolis and Euler forces in the equation of motion. For slowly rotating
bodies such as Venus, the full LE together with energy analysis indicate that
previous estimates of TPW in the normal direction need to be revisited. The

is described by its spin period and two angles: spin inclination $\alpha$ with
respect to the orbital momentum and magnetic angle $\chi$ between the spin and
the magnetic moment. Magnetospheric accretion spins the NS up and adjusts its
rotation axis, decreasing $\alpha$ to nearly perfect alignment. Its effect upon
the magnetic angle is more subtle and relatively unstudied. In this work, we
model the magnetic angle evolution of a rigid spherical accreting NS. We find
that the torque spinning the NS up may affect the magnetic angle while both
$\alpha$ and $\chi$ significantly deviate from zero, and the spin-up torque
varies with the phase of the spin period. As the rotation axis of the NS is
being aligned with the spin-up torque, the magnetic axis becomes misaligned
with the rotation axis. Under favourable conditions, magnetic angle may
increase by $\Delta \chi \sim 15^\circ-20^\circ$. This orthogonalisation may be
an important factor in the evolution of millisecond pulsars, as it partially
compensates the $\chi$ decrease potentially caused by pulsar torques. If the
direction of the spin-up torque changes randomly with time, as in wind-fed
high-mass X-ray binaries, both the rotation axis of the NS and its magnetic
axis become involved in a non-linear random-walk evolution. The ultimate
attractor of this process is a bimodal distribution in $\chi$ peaking at $\chi
=0^\circ$ and $\chi = 90^\circ$.

is often considered important for tidal evolution in close binary and
extrasolar planetary systems. Its efficiency for fast tides has however long
been controversial, when the tidal frequency exceeds the turnover frequency of
convective eddies. Recent numerical simulations indicate that convection can
act like an effective viscosity which decays quadratically with tidal frequency
for fast tides, resulting in inefficient dissipation in many applications
involving pre- and main-sequence stars and giant planets. A new idea was
however recently proposed by Terquem (2021), who suggested Reynolds stresses
involving correlations between tidal flow components dominate the interaction
instead of correlations between convective flow components as usually assumed.
They further showed that this can potentially significantly enhance tidal
dissipation for fast tides in many applications. Motivated by the importance of
this problem for tidal dissipation in stars and planets, we directly compute
this new term using analytical arguments and global spherical simulations using
Boussinesq and anelastic hydrodynamic models. We demonstrate that the new term
proposed by Terquem vanishes identically for equilibrium tides interacting with
convection in both Boussinesq and anelastic models; it is therefore unlikely to
contribute to tidal dissipation in stars and planets.

to elementary cellular automata that evolve according to threshold rules.
  Our main result is the identification of a set of conditions on local rules,
and a meta-algorithm that tests evolution according to local rules that satisfy
the conditions. The meta-algorithm has query complexity poly$ (1/\epsilon) $,
is non-adaptive and has one-sided error. We show that all the threshold rules

decision-making under uncertainty where the uncertain parameters are only known
to reside in an uncertainty set or are governed by any probability distribution

minimizes a cost function under the most adverse outcome of the uncertainty. In
this paper, we develop a rigorous and general theory of robust and
distributionally robust nonlinear optimization using the language of convex
analysis. Our framework is based on a generalized
`primal-worst-equals-dual-best' principle that establishes strong duality
between a semi-infinite primal worst and a non-convex dual best formulation,
both of which admit finite convex reformulations. This principle offers an
alternative formulation for robust optimization problems that may be
computationally advantageous, and it obviates the need to mobilize the
machinery of abstract semi-infinite duality theory to prove strong duality in
distributionally robust optimization. We illustrate the modeling power of our
approach through convex reformulations for distributionally robust optimization
problems whose ambiguity sets are defined through general optimal transport
distances, which generalize earlier results for Wasserstein ambiguity sets.

output $y$ of $f$, i.e., to find $x\in f^{-1}(y)$. Much progress was done
regarding adaptive function inversion - the inverter is allowed to make
adaptive oracle queries. Hellman [IEEE transactions on Information Theory 80]
presented an adaptive inverter that inverts with high probability a random $f$.
Fiat and Naor [SICOMP 00] proved that for any $s$, $q$ with $s^3q = n$
(ignoring low-order terms), an $s$-advice, $q$-query variant of Hellmans
algorithm inverts a constant fraction of the image points of any function. Yao
[STOC 90] proved a lower bound of $sq \geq n$ for this problem. Closing the gap
between the above lower and upper bounds is a long-standing open question. Very
little is known for the non-adaptive variant of the question. The only known
upper bounds, i.e., inverters, are the trivial ones (with $s+q = n$), and the
only lower bound is the above bound of Yao. In a recent work, Corrigan-Gibbs
and Kogan [TCC 19] partially justified the difficulty of finding lower bounds
on non-adaptive inverters, showing that a lower bound on the time/memory
tradeoff of non-adaptive inverters implies a lower bound on low-depth Boolean
circuits. Bounds that, for a strong enough choice of parameters, are
notoriously hard to prove. We make progress on the above intriguing question,
both for the adaptive and the non-adaptive case, proving the following lower
bounds on restricted families of inverters.

provide 24 interactive tasks, which represent (but are not limited to) four
essential aspects in early human development: joint-level locomotion and

server, as well as task processing via device-to-device (D2D) collaboration.
Existing works mainly focus on centralized network-assisted offloading
solutions, which are unscalable to scenarios involving collaboration among
massive users. In this paper, we propose a joint framework of decentralized D2D
collaboration and efficient task offloading for a large-population MEC system.
Specifically, we utilize the power of two choices for D2D collaboration, which
enables users to beneficially assist each other in a decentralized manner. Due
to short-range D2D communication and user movements, we formulate a mean field
model on a finite-degree and dynamic graph to analyze the state evolution of
D2D collaboration. We derive the existence, uniqueness and convergence of the
state stationary point so as to provide a tractable collaboration performance.
Complementing this D2D collaboration, we further build a Stackelberg game to
model users' task offloading, where edge server is the leader to determine a
service price, while users are followers to make offloading decisions. By
embedding the Stackelberg game into Lyapunov optimization, we develop an online
offloading and pricing scheme, which could optimize server's service utility
and users' system cost simultaneously. Extensive evaluations show that our D2D
collaboration can mitigate users' workloads by $73.8\%$ and task offloading can
achieve high energy efficiency.

number of agents by approximating their interactions with an average effect.
Existing mean field models for multi-agent MAB mostly assume a binary reward
function, which leads to tractable analysis but is usually not applicable in
practical scenarios. In this paper, we study the mean field bandit game with a
continuous reward function. Specifically, we focus on deriving the existence
and uniqueness of mean field equilibrium (MFE), thereby guaranteeing the
asymptotic stability of the multi-agent system. To accommodate the continuous
reward function, we encode the learned reward into an agent state, which is in
turn mapped to its stochastic arm playing policy and updated using realized
observations. We show that the state evolution is upper semi-continuous, based
on which the existence of MFE is obtained. As the Markov analysis is mainly for
the case of discrete state, we transform the stochastic continuous state
evolution into a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE). On this
basis, we can characterize a contraction mapping for the ODE to ensure a unique
MFE for the bandit game. Extensive evaluations validate our MFE
characterization, and exhibit tight empirical regret of the MAB problem.

information components. These components are a function of the joint
distribution of the three variables, and are typically defined using an
optimization over the space of all possible joint distributions. This makes it
computationally challenging to compute PIDs in practice and restricts their use
to low-dimensional random vectors. To ease this burden, we consider the case of
jointly Gaussian random vectors in this paper. This case was previously
examined by Barrett (2015), who showed that certain operationally
well-motivated PIDs reduce to a closed form expression for scalar messages.
Here, we show that Barrett's result does not extend to vector messages in

reduce to closed-form. Then, for all other multivariate Gaussian distributions,
we propose a convex optimization framework for approximately computing a
specific PID definition based on the statistical concept of deficiency. Using
simplifying assumptions specific to the Gaussian case, we provide an efficient
algorithm to approximately compute the bivariate PID for multivariate Gaussian

or, in the computational setting, in computational indistinguishability. For
this choice, Wullschleger [TCC 09] showed that if $\alpha>>\epsilon$ then the

  We consider measuring the protocol leakage by the log-ratio distance (which
was popularized by its use in the differential privacy framework). The
log-ratio distance between X,Y over domain \Omega is the minimal $\epsilon>0$

complete the picture, in this respect, showing that a protocol with $\alpha\in

literature, OBIs store a lot of information that can help us understand the
world history, character evaluations, and more. However, as OBIs were found
only discovered about 120 years ago, few studies have described them, and the
aging process has made the inscriptions less legible. Hence, automatic
character detection and recognition has become an important issue. This paper
aims to design a online OBI recognition system for helping preservation and
organization the cultural heritage. We evaluated two deep learning models for
OBI recognition, and have designed an API that can be accessed online for OBI
recognition. In the first stage, you only look once (YOLO) is applied for
detecting and recognizing OBIs. However, not all of the OBIs can be detected
correctly by YOLO, so we next utilize MobileNet to recognize the undetected
OBIs by manually cropping the undetected OBI in the image. MobileNet is used
for this second stage of recognition as our evaluation of ten state-of-the-art

superior performance in terms of accuracy, loss and time consumption. We
installed our system on an application programming interface (API) and opened

  We consider classic and randomized stopping times represented by linear and

stopping times, in fact, solves the original optimal stopping problem. Using
the algebraic properties of the signature, we can then recast the problem as a

deep neural network approach to approximate the non-linear signature

random rough path. Hence, the theory encompasses processes such as fractional
Brownian motion, which fail to be either semi-martingales or Markov processes,

Awerbuch, Blum, Chor, Goldwasser, and Micali[Manuscript '85] constructed a
$\Theta(1/\sqrt{r})$-fair coin-flipping protocol, assuming the existence of
one-way functions. Moran, Naor, and Segev [Journal of Cryptology '16]
constructed an $r$-round coin-flipping protocol that is $\Theta(1/r)$-fair

the existence of oblivious transfer.
  The above gives rise to the intriguing question of whether oblivious

$o(1/\sqrt r)$-fair coin flipping protocol. We make a different progress
towards answering the question by showing that, for any constant $r\in \N$, the
existence of an $1/(c\cdot \sqrt{r})$-fair, $r$-round coin-flipping protocol
implies the existence of an infinitely-often key-agreement protocol, where $c$

selection scores computed by graph neural networks. For learning the score
functions, we also propose a novel contrastive training scheme with hard

studies, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of active peer effects
in residential photovoltaic (PV) diffusion. Empirical evidence indicates that
the impacts of inter-subjective exchanges are dependent on the subjective
mutual evaluation of the interlocutors. This paper aims to quantify, how
subjective evaluations of peers affect peer effects across different stages of
PV adoption decision-making. The findings of a survey among potential and
current adopters in Germany(N=1,165)confirm two hypotheses. First, peer effects
play a role in residential PV adoption: the number of peer adopters in the
decision-maker's social circle has a positive effect on the decision-maker's
belief that their social network supports PV adoption; their ascription of
credibility on PV-related topics to their peers; and their interest in actively
seeking information from their peers in all decision-making stages. Second,
there is a correlation between the perceived positive attributes of a given
peer and the reported influence of said peer within the decision-making
process, suggesting that decision-makers' subjective evaluations of peers play
an important role in active peer effects. Decision-makers are significantly
more likely to engage in and be influenced by interactions with peers who they
perceive as competent, trustworthy, and likeable. In contrast, attributes such
as physical closeness and availability have a less significant effect. From a
policymaking perspective, this study suggests that the density and quality of
peer connections empower potential adopters. Accordingly, peer consultation and
community-led outreach initiatives should be promoted to accelerate residential
PV adoption.

state-of-the-art specialised symplectic and non-symplectic integrators in both
speed and accuracy. In particular, we show how Taylor methods are capable of
satisfying Brouwer's law for the conservation of energy in long-term
integrations of planetary systems over billions of dynamical timescales. We
also show how close encounters are modelled accurately during simulations of
the formation of the Kirkwood gaps and of Apophis' 2029 close encounter with
the Earth (where heyoka surpasses the speed and accuracy of domain-specific
methods). heyoka can be used from both C++ and Python, and it is publicly

  Interactive Arguments via Smooth KL-Divergence","A preliminary version appeared in Crypto 2020",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hardness amplification is a central problem in the study of interactive
protocols. While ``natural'' parallel repetition transformation is known to
reduce the soundness error of some special cases of interactive arguments:
three-message protocols and public-coin protocols, it fails to do so in the
general case.
  The only known round-preserving approach that applies to all interactive
arguments is Haitner's random-terminating transformation [SICOMP '13], who
showed that the parallel repetition of the transformed protocol reduces the
soundness error at a weak exponential rate: if the original $m$-round protocol
has soundness error $1-p$, then the $n$-parallel repetition of its
random-terminating variant has soundness error $(1-p)^{p n / m^4}$ (omitting
constant factors). Hastad et al. [TCC '10] have generalized this result to
partially simulatable interactive arguments, showing that the $n$-fold
repetition of an $m$-round $\delta$-simulatable argument of soundness error
$1-p$ has soundness error $(1-p)^{p \delta^2 n / m^2}$. When applied to
random-terminating arguments, the Hastad et al. bound matches that of Haitner.
  In this work we prove that parallel repetition of random-terminating
arguments reduces the soundness error at a much stronger exponential rate: the
soundness error of the $n$ parallel repetition is $(1-p)^{n / m}$, only an $m$
factor from the optimal rate of $(1-p)^n$ achievable in public-coin and
three-message arguments. The result generalizes to $\delta$-simulatable
arguments, for which we prove a bound of $(1-p)^{\delta n / m}$. This is
achieved by presenting a tight bound on a relaxed variant of the KL-divergence
between the distribution induced by our reduction and its ideal variant, a
result whose scope extends beyond parallel repetition proofs. We prove the
tightness of the above bound for random-terminating arguments, by presenting a
matching protocol.

background of the 5-dimensional locally anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime with a
compact dimension and in the presence of a cosmic string carrying a magnetic
flux. The FC is decomposed into two contributions. The first one corresponds to
the geometry without compactification and the second one is induced by the
compactification. Depending on the values of the parameters, the total FC can
be either positive or negative. As a limiting case, the expression for the FC
on locally Minkowski spacetime is derived. It vanishes for a massless fermion
field and the nonzero FC on the AdS bulk in the massless case is an effect
induced by gravitation. This shows that the gravitational field may essentially
influence the parameters space for phase transitions. For a massive field the
FC diverges on the string as the inverse cube of the proper distance from the
string. In the case of a massless field, depending on the magnetic flux along
the string and planar angle deficit, the limiting value of the FC on the string
can be either finite or infinite. At large distances, the decay of the FC as a
function of the distance from the string is power law for both cases of massive
and massless fields. For a cosmic string on the Minkowski bulk and for a
massive field the decay is exponential. The topological part in the FC vanishes
on the AdS boundary. We show that the FCs coincide for the fields realizing two
inequivalent irreducible representations of the Clifford algebra. In the
special case of the zero planar angle deficit, the results presented in this

(close to) unbiased bit, even when some corrupted parties try to bias the
output. Cleve [STOC 1986] has shown that in the case of dishonest majority
(i.e., at least half of the parties can be corrupted), in any $m$-round
coin-flipping protocol the corrupted parties can bias the honest parties'
common output bit by $\Omega(\frac1{m})$. For more than two decades the best
known coin-flipping protocols against dishonest majority had bias
$\Theta(\frac{\ell}{\sqrt{m}})$, where $\ell$ is the number of corrupted
parties. This was changed by a recent breakthrough result of Moran et al. [TCC
2009], who constructed an $m$-round, two-party coin-flipping protocol with
optimal bias $\Theta(\frac1{m})$. In a subsequent work, Beimel et al. [Crypto
2010] extended this result to the multiparty case in which less than $\frac23$
of the parties can be corrupted. Still for the case of $\frac23$ (or more)
corrupted parties, the best known protocol had bias
$\Theta(\frac{\ell}{\sqrt{m}})$. In particular, this was the state of affairs
for the natural three-party case.
  We make a step towards eliminating the above gap, presenting an $m$-round,
three-party coin-flipping protocol, with bias $\frac{O(\log^3 m)}m$. Our
approach (which we also apply for the two-party case) does not follow the
""threshold round"" paradigm used in the work of Moran et al. and Beimel et al.,

  for Relevance and Fairness","full paper in the SIGIR 2021 conference proceedings",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent work has proposed stochastic Plackett-Luce (PL) ranking models as a
robust choice for optimizing relevance and fairness metrics. Unlike their
deterministic counterparts that require heuristic optimization algorithms, PL
models are fully differentiable. Theoretically, they can be used to optimize
ranking metrics via stochastic gradient descent. However, in practice, the
computation of the gradient is infeasible because it requires one to iterate
over all possible permutations of items. Consequently, actual applications rely
on approximating the gradient via sampling techniques. In this paper, we
introduce a novel algorithm: PL-Rank, that estimates the gradient of a PL
ranking model w.r.t. both relevance and fairness metrics. Unlike existing
approaches that are based on policy gradients, PL-Rank makes use of the
specific structure of PL models and ranking metrics. Our experimental analysis
shows that PL-Rank has a greater sample-efficiency and is computationally less
costly than existing policy gradients, resulting in faster convergence at
higher performance. PL-Rank further enables the industry to apply PL models for
more relevant and fairer real-world ranking systems.

$\mathcal{F}$-{\sc Vertex Deletion}. Only three cases of minor-closed ${\cal

the problem for the class ${\cal F}$ of $\theta_c$-minor-free graphs, under the
equivalent setting of the \textsc{Weighted $c$-Bond Cover} problem, and present
a constant-factor approximation algorithm using the primal-dual method. For
this, we leverage a structure theorem implicit in [Joret et al., SIDMA'14]
which states the following: any graph $G$ containing a $\theta_c$-minor-model
either contains a large two-terminal {\sl protrusion}, or contains a
constant-size $\theta_c$-minor-model, or a collection of pairwise disjoint {\sl
constant-sized} connected sets that can be contracted simultaneously to yield a
dense graph. In the first case, we tame the graph by replacing the protrusion
with a special-purpose weighted gadget. For the second and third case, we
provide a weighting scheme which guarantees a local approximation ratio.
Besides making an important step in the quest of (dis)proving a constant-factor
approximation for \textsc{Weighted} $\mathcal{F}$-\textsc{Vertex Deletion}, our
result may be useful as a template for algorithms for other minor-closed

  descriptors might be surprisingly good!","Accepted at Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL) 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Standard losses for training deep segmentation networks could be seen as
individual classifications of pixels, instead of supervising the global shape
of the predicted segmentations. While effective, they require exact knowledge
of the label of each pixel in an image.
  This study investigates how effective global geometric shape descriptors
could be, when used on their own as segmentation losses for training deep
networks. Not only interesting theoretically, there exist deeper motivations to
posing segmentation problems as a reconstruction of shape descriptors:
Annotations to obtain approximations of low-order shape moments could be much
less cumbersome than their full-mask counterparts, and anatomical priors could
be readily encoded into invariant shape descriptions, which might alleviate the
annotation burden. Also, and most importantly, we hypothesize that, given a
task, certain shape descriptions might be invariant across image acquisition
protocols/modalities and subject populations, which might open interesting
research avenues for generalization in medical image segmentation.
  We introduce and formulate a few shape descriptors in the context of deep
segmentation, and evaluate their potential as standalone losses on two
different challenging tasks. Inspired by recent works in constrained
optimization for deep networks, we propose a way to use those descriptors to
supervise segmentation, without any pixel-level label. Very surprisingly, as
little as 4 descriptors values per class can approach the performance of a
segmentation mask with 65k individual discrete labels. We also found that shape
descriptors can be a valid way to encode anatomical priors about the task,
enabling to leverage expert knowledge without additional annotations. Our
implementation is publicly available and can be easily extended to other tasks
and descriptors: https://github.com/hkervadec/shape_descriptors

this paper. We introduce the Gibbs free energy landscape and calculate the
corresponding $G_L$ for the dilaton black hole. On the one hand, we numerically
solve the Fokker-Planck equation constrained by only the reflecting boundary
condition. The effects of dilaton gravity on the probabilistic evolution of
dilaton black holes are quite obvious. Firstly, the horizon radius difference
between the large dilaton black hole and small dilaton black hole increases
with the parameter $\alpha$. Secondly, with the increasing of $\alpha$, the
system needs much more time to achieve a stationary distribution. Thirdly, the
value which $\rho(r_l,t)$ and $\rho(r_s,t)$ finally attain varies with the
parameter $\alpha$. On the other hand, resolving Fokker-Planck equation
constrained by both the reflecting boundary condition and absorbing boundary
condition, we investigate the first passage process of dilaton black holes. The
initial peak decays more slowly with the increase of $\alpha$, which can also
be witnessed from the slow down of the decay of $\Sigma(t)$ (the sum of the
probability that the black hole system having not finished a first passage by
time $t$). Moreover, the time corresponding to the single peak of the first
passage time distribution is also found to increase with the parameter
$\alpha$. Considering all the observations mentioned above, the dilaton field
does slow down the dynamic phase transition process between the large black
hole and small black hole.

choose inferior site(s). But, the collective decision that emerges from the
sequential and decentralized decision making process is often far better. We
develop a model for this multi-stage decision making process. A stochastic

computationally expensive task. Computing the reachable states for linear
systems, in contrast, can often be done efficiently in high dimensions. In this
paper, we explore verification methods that leverage a connection between these
two classes of systems based on the concept of the Koopman operator. The
Koopman operator links the behaviors of a nonlinear system to a linear system
embedded in a higher dimensional space, with an additional set of so-called
observable variables. Although, the new dynamical system has linear
differential equations, the set of initial states is defined with nonlinear
constraints. For this reason, existing approaches for linear systems
reachability cannot be used directly. In this paper, we propose the first
reachability algorithm that deals with this unexplored type of reachability
problem. Our evaluation examines several optimizations, and shows the proposed
workflow is a promising avenue for verifying behaviors of nonlinear systems.

aftershock sequence (ETAS) model based on expectation maximization (EM) while
accounting for temporal variation of catalog completeness. The first method
allows for model calibration on long-term earthquake catalogs with temporal
variation of the completeness magnitude, $m_c$. This calibration technique is
beneficial for long-term probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA), which
is often based on a mixture of instrumental and historical catalogs. The second
method generalizes the concept of $m_c$, considering rate- and
magnitude-dependent detection probability, and allows for self-consistent
estimation of ETAS parameters and high-frequency detection incompleteness. With
this approach, we aim to address the potential biases in parameter calibration
due to short-term aftershock incompleteness, embracing incompleteness instead
of avoiding it. Using synthetic tests, we show that both methods can accurately
invert the parameters of simulated catalogs. We then use them to estimate ETAS
parameters for California using the earthquake catalog since 1932. To explore
how model calibration, inclusion of small events, and accounting for short-term
incompleteness affect earthquakes' predictability, we systematically compare
variants of ETAS models based on the second approach in pseudo-prospective
forecasting experiments for California. Our proposed model significantly
outperforms the ETAS null model, with decreasing information gain for
increasing target magnitude threshold. We find that the ability to include
small earthquakes for simulation of future scenarios is the primary driver of
the improvement and that accounting for incompleteness is necessary. Our
results have significant implications for our understanding of earthquake
interaction mechanisms and the future of seismicity forecasting.

can separate different particles according their electromagnetic charges. This
phenomenon can be used to distinguish leptoquarks of different gauge

these two colliders are complementary to each other and both of them are
required for an exhaustive analysis of leptoquark models. The analyses are
carried out for different leptoquark masses and centre of mass energies of the

the best performance in the noise-free setting, with much less difference

to over-exploration with UCB, but is not detrimental with EI. Therefore, we
recommend that FBBO using EI with an ARD kernel as the default choice for BO.

metrics as flare precursors, the unsigned flux R, tested on MDI/SOHO data and
one of the most used parameters for flare forecasting applications, and a novel
topological parameter D representing the complexity of a solar active region.
More in detail, we propose an algorithm for the computation of the R value
which exploits the higher spatial resolution of HMI maps. This algorithm leads
to a differently computed R value, whose functionality is tested on a set of
cycle 24th solar flares. Furthermore, we introduce a topological parameter
based on the automatic recognition of magnetic polarity-inversion lines in
identified active regions, and able to evaluate its magnetic topological
complexity. We use both a heuristic approach and a supervised machine learning
method to validate the effectiveness of these two descriptors to predict the
occurrence of X- or M- class flares in a given solar active region during the
following 24 hours period. Our feature ranking analysis shows that both
parameters play a significant role in prediction performances. Moreover, the
analysis demonstrates that the new topological parameter D is the only one,
among 173 overall predictors, which is always present for all test subsets and
is systematically ranked within the top-ten positions in all tests concerning
the computation of the weighs with which each predictor impacts the flare

properties of the fast discrete wavelet transformation (FDWT) such as (1) the
cascade algorithm, (2) the conjugate quadrature filter property that links
together the wavelet, the scaling and transposed filter functions, and (3) the
coefficient denoising. Using deep learning, we make this architecture fully
learnable: both the wavelet bases and the wavelet coefficient denoising are
learnable. To achieve this objective, we propose a new activation function that
performs a learnable hard-thresholding of the wavelet coefficients. With our
framework, the denoising FDWT becomes a fully learnable unsupervised tool that
does neither require any type of pre- nor post-processing, nor any prior

The action of the transport operator on such space-velocity dependent weight

first-order phase transition, as there are two different competing order
parameters. On the other hand, it is known that the theory has the property of
self-duality which has been connected to the existence of a deconfined quantum
critical point (DQCP). The latter regime suggests that order parameters are not
the elementary building blocks of the theory, but rather consist of
fractionalized particles that are confined in both phases of the transition and
only appear - deconfine - at the critical point. Nevertheless, many numerical
Monte Carlo simulations disagree with the claim of a DQCP in the system,
indicating instead a first-order phase transition. Here we establish from exact
lattice duality transformations and renormalization group analysis that the
easy-plane CP1 antiferromagnet does feature a DQCP. We uncover the criticality
starting from a regime analogous to the zero temperature limit of a certain
classical statistical mechanics system which we therefore dub ""frozen"". At
criticality our bosonic theory is dual to a fermionic one with two massless
Dirac fermions, which thus undergoes a second-order phase transition as well.

parameters that arise in the expansion of several geometric quantities in
powers of the stress-energy tensor of the matter fields. We discuss the
relevance of this result for the phenomenology of non-relativistic stars, such
as main-sequence stars as well as several substellar objects.

other six frequencies have more ambiguous identifications. The photometric mode
identification provided also some constraints on the atmospheric metallicity
[m/H]$\approx$+0.5 and microturbulent velocity $\xi_t\approx 4~\kms$.\\ For
models reproducing the dominant frequency, we show that only the fundamental
mode is possible and the first overtone is excluded. However, the location of
$\delta$ Scuti near the terminal age main sequence requires the consideration
of three stages of stellar evolution. For the star to be on the main sequence,
it is necessary to include overshooting from the convective core with a
parameter of at least $\alpha_{\rm ov}=0.25$ at the metallicity greater than
$Z=0.019$. It turned out that the value of the relative amplitude of the
bolometric flux variations (the nonadiabatic parameter $f$) is mainly
determined by the position of the star in the HR diagram, i.e., by its
effective temperature and luminosity, whereas the effect of the evolutionary
stage is minor. On the other hand, the convective efficiency in the
subphotospheric layers has a dominant effect on the value of the parameter $f$.
%in the $\delta$ Sct star models. Comparing the theoretical and empirical
values of $f$ for the radial dominant mode, we obtain constraints on the mixing
length parameter $\alpha_{\rm MLT}$ which is less than about 1.0, independently
of the adopted opacity data and chemical mixture. This value of $\alpha_{\rm
MLT}$ is substantially smaller than for a calibrated solar model indicating
rather low to moderately efficient convection in the envelope of $\delta$

abundant momentum-space crossings and narrow energy-gap openings are the
primary sources of the anomalous Hall conductivity. An important observation is
the existence of quasi-dispersionless bands in LaCrSb3 which is now known to
increase the anomalous Hall conductivity. After introducing f-electrons,
anomalous Hall conductivity experiences more than two-fold increase and reaches
2900 S/cm in NdCrSb3.

with unique precision. A recent concern appeared with the progress in the solar
surface abundances derivation that has led to a decrease of the solar
metallicity. While the ancient high-metallicity models were in fair agreement
with other solar observational indicators, it is no longer the case for
low-metallicity models. Recent collection of data are however promising to shed
a new light on it. For instance, the Borexino collaboration released in 2020
the first-ever complete estimate of neutrinos emitted in the CNO cycle. It has
reaffirmed the role of the neutrino constraints in the solar modelling process
and its associated issues. In parallel, newly claimed detection of solar
gravity modes of oscillations offers another opportunity of probing the
stratification in the Sun's central layers. Aims: We propose to combine the
diagnoses from neutrinos and helioseismology, both from pressure and gravity
modes, for assessing the predictions of solar models. We compare in detail the
different physical prescriptions currently at disposal for stellar model
computations. Results: The CNO neutrino flux confirms a preference for
high-metallicity models. Nevertheless, we found that mild modification of the
nuclear screening factors can re-match low-metallicity model predictions to
observed fluxes, although it does not restore the agreement with the
helioseismic frequency ratios. Neither the high-metallicity or low-metallicity
models are able to reproduce the gravity-mode period spacing. The disagreement
is huge, more than 100$\sigma$ to the reported value. Reversely, the family of
standard models narrows the expected range of the Sun's period spacing: between
$\sim$2150 to $\sim$2190~s. Moreover, we show this indicator can constrain the
chemical mixture, opacity, and to a lower extent nuclear reactions in solar
models.

to generic graphs of the Earth system to identify where causal inference may be
most tractable and useful to address problems in Earth Science, and avoid

when: (1) the effect of interest is only causally affected by the observed

independent of the evolution of the system's state; or: (3) the state space of
the system is reconstructable from lagged observations of the system. However,

face-based scheme can be embedded into the framework of hybrid mixed mimetic
schemes and gradient schemes, and has close links to the lowest-order version
of hybrid high-order methods devised for the steady incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. The AC timestepping uncouples at each time step the
velocity update from the pressure update. The performances of this approach are
compared against those of the more traditional monolithic approach which
maintains the velocity-pressure coupling at each time step. We consider both
first-order and second-order time schemes and either an implicit or an explicit
treatment of the nonlinear convection term. We investigate numerically the CFL
stability restriction resulting from an explicit treatment, both on Cartesian

lifted by these ways can be viewed as multiple QMBSs. In this work, we focus on
the study of the perturbation-induced QMBS. Perturbed states, which are
connected to the exact QMBSs in the unperturbed limit, indicate common
properties of conventional QMBS systems, that is, a subspace with sub-volume or
area law scaling entanglement entropy, which indicates the violation of the
strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Also for a specific initial
state, slow-thermalization dynamics appears. We numerically demonstrate these
subjects. The flat-band model with interactions is a characteristic example in
non-integrable systems with the violation of the strong ETH and the QMBS.

effect on the spin state of a nearby nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond.
Thin permalloy disks fabricated on a diamond sample are magnetized in a vortex
state in which the magnetization curls around a central core. The magnetization
dynamics of this configuration are described by a discrete spectrum of confined
magnon modes, as well as a low-frequency gyrotropic mode in which the vortex
core precesses about its equilibrium position. Despite the spin transition
frequencies being far-detuned from the modes of the ferromagnet, we observe
enhanced relaxation of the NV spin when driving the gyrotropic mode. Moreover,
we map the spatial dependence of the interaction between the vortex and the
spin by translating the vortex core within the disk with an applied magnetic
field, resulting in steplike motion as the vortex is pinned and de-pinned. The
strong spin relaxation is observed when the vortex core is within approximately
250 nm of the NV center defect. We attribute this effect to the higher
frequencies in the spectrum of the magnetic fringe field arising from the
soliton-like nature of the gyrotropic mode when driven with sufficiently large
amplitude.

due to differences in data preparation, segmentation, encoding strategies, and
performance metrics, results are hard to compare, which makes building upon
that knowledge difficult. Thus, the main goal of this work is to perform a
systematic assessment of the HD computing framework for the detection of
epileptic seizures, comparing different feature approaches mapped to HD
vectors. More precisely, we test two previously implemented features as well as
several novel approaches with HD computing on epileptic seizure detection. We
evaluate them in a comparable way, i.e., with the same preprocessing setup, and
with the identical performance measures. We use two different datasets in order
to assess the generalizability of our conclusions. The systematic assessment
involved three primary aspects relevant for potential wearable implementations:
1) detection performance, 2) memory requirements, and 3) computational
complexity. Our analysis shows a significant difference in detection
performance between approaches, but also that the ones with the highest
performance might not be ideal for wearable applications due to their high
memory or computational requirements. Furthermore, we evaluate a
post-processing strategy to adjust the predictions to the dynamics of epileptic
seizures, showing that performance is significantly improved in all the

Recently, there have been attempts not only to generate better visual

this paper, we propose a novel architecture, LFI-CAM, which is trainable for

generates an attention map for visual explanation during forward propagation,
at the same time, leverages the attention map to improve the classification

the attention map to obtain a more reliable and consistent attention map. We
confirmed that LFI-CAM model is optimized not only by learning the feature
importance but also by enhancing the backbone feature representation to focus
more on important features of the input image. Experimental results show that
LFI-CAM outperforms the baseline models's accuracy on the classification tasks

propose SmoothI, a smooth approximation of rank indicators that serves as a
basic building block to devise differentiable approximations of IR metrics. We
further provide theoretical guarantees on SmoothI and derived approximations,
showing in particular that the approximation errors decrease exponentially with
an inverse temperature-like hyperparameter that controls the quality of the
approximations. Extensive experiments conducted on four standard

spectral dimensions of the simplicial complex Laplacians that are responsible
for changing the phase diagram of the Kuramoto model. In particular, simplicial
complexes displaying a non-trivial simplicial network geometry cannot sustain a
synchronized state in the infinite network limit if their spectral dimension is
smaller or equal to four. This theoretical result is here verified on the
Network Geometry with Flavor simplicial complex generative model displaying
emergent hyperbolic geometry. On its turn simplicial topology is shown to
determine the dynamical properties of the higher-order Kuramoto model. The
higher-orderKuramoto model describes synchronization of topological signals,
i.e. phases not only associated to the nodes of a simplicial complexes but
associated also to higher-order simplices, including links, triangles and so

maximize the channel capacity of the multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
system. Specifically, considering the limitations of each UAV in accessing the
global information of the network, we focus on a decentralized control strategy
by noting that each UAV in the swarm can only utilize the local information to
achieve the optimal 3-D deployment. In this case, the optimization problem can
be divided into several optimization sub-problems with respect to the rank
function. Due to the non-convex nature of the rank function and the fact that
the optimization sub-problems are coupled, the original problem is NP-hard and,
thus, cannot be solved with standard convex optimization solvers.
Interestingly, we can relax the constraint condition of each sub-problem and
solve the optimization problem by a formulated UAVs channel capacity
maximization game. We analyze such game according to the designed reward
function and the potential function. Then, we discuss the existence of the pure
Nash equilibrium in the game. To achieve the best Nash equilibrium of the MIMO
system, we develop a decentralized learning algorithm, namely decentralized
UAVs channel capacity learning. The details of the algorithm are provided, and
then, the convergence, the effectiveness and the computational complexity are

Because of the radiation zero, the NLO QCD contribution from the $gq$ channel

higher-order correlations among entities, has recently attracted increasing
attention from various research domains. Despite the success of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for graph representation learning, how to adapt the powerful
GNN-variants directly into hypergraphs remains a challenging problem. In this
paper, we propose UniGNN, a unified framework for interpreting the message
passing process in graph and hypergraph neural networks, which can generalize
general GNN models into hypergraphs. In this framework, meticulously-designed
architectures aiming to deepen GNNs can also be incorporated into hypergraphs
with the least effort. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate
the effectiveness of UniGNN on multiple real-world datasets, which outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches with a large margin. Especially for the DBLP
dataset, we increase the accuracy from 77.4\% to 88.8\% in the semi-supervised
hypernode classification task. We further prove that the proposed
message-passing based UniGNN models are at most as powerful as the
1-dimensional Generalized Weisfeiler-Leman (1-GWL) algorithm in terms of
distinguishing non-isomorphic hypergraphs. Our code is available at

based on training instances with partial annotations such as image-level tags,
object bounding boxes, labeled points and scribbles. This task is challenging,
as coarse annotations (tags, boxes) lack precise pixel localization whereas
sparse annotations (points, scribbles) lack broad region coverage. Existing
methods tackle these two types of weak supervision differently: Class
activation maps are used to localize coarse labels and iteratively refine the
segmentation model, whereas conditional random fields are used to propagate
sparse labels to the entire image.
  We formulate weakly supervised segmentation as a semi-supervised metric
learning problem, where pixels of the same (different) semantics need to be
mapped to the same (distinctive) features. We propose 4 types of contrastive
relationships between pixels and segments in the feature space, capturing
low-level image similarity, semantic annotation, co-occurrence, and feature
affinity They act as priors; the pixel-wise feature can be learned from
training images with any partial annotations in a data-driven fashion. In
particular, unlabeled pixels in training images participate not only in
data-driven grouping within each image, but also in discriminative feature
learning within and across images. We deliver a universal weakly supervised

equation with a gap in its quasi-energy spectrum. This quasi-energy gap is
typical of many reduced models of time-periodic (Floquet) materials and plays a
role in conclusions drawn about the full system: conduction vs. insulation,
topological vs. non-topological bands. Much is unknown about nature of the
quasi-energy spectrum of original time-periodic Schroedinger equation, and it
is believed that no such quasi-energy gap occurs. In this paper, we explain how
to transfer quasi-energy gap information about the effective Dirac dynamics to
conclusions about the full Schroedinger dynamics. We introduce the notion of an
{\it effective quasi-energy gap}, and establish its existence in the
Schroedinger model. In the current setting, an effective quasi-energy gap is an
interval of quasi-energies which does not support modes with large spectral
projection onto band-limited Dirac wave-packets. The notion of effective
quasi-energy gap is a physically relevant relaxation of the strict notion of
quasi-energy spectral gap; if a system is tuned to drive or measure at momenta

effective quasi-energy gap will only be weakly excited and detected.

in both compressively (irrotationally) and vortically (solenoidally) forced
turbulence. Vortically and compressively forced flows are driven stochastically
either by solenoidal waves or by circular expansion waves, respectively. For
compressively forced flows, the power spectrum of the density of inertial
particles is a useful tool for displaying particle clustering relative to the
fluid density enhancement. Power spectra are shown to be particularly sensitive
for studying large-scale particle clustering, while conventional tools such as
radial distribution functions are more suitable for studying small-scale
clustering. Our primary finding is that particle clustering through shock
interaction is particularly prominent in turbulence driven by spherical
expansion waves. It manifests itself through a double-peaked distribution of
spectral power as a function of Stokes number. The two peaks are associated
with two distinct clustering mechanisms; shock interaction for smaller Stokes
numbers and the centrifugal sling effect for larger values. The clustering of
inertial particles is associated with the formation of caustics. Such caustics
can only be captured in the Lagrangian description, which allows us to assess
the relative importance of caustics in vortically and compressively forced
turbulence. We show that the statistical noise resulting from the limited
number of particles in the Lagrangian description can be removed from the
particle power spectra, allowing us a more detailed comparison of the residual
spectra. We focus on the Epstein drag law relevant for rarefied gases, but show
that our findings apply also to the usual Stokes drag.

inference time for deep neural networks in real-world deployments. However,
since magnitudes and relative importance of weights are very different for
different layers of a neural network, existing methods rely on either manual
tuning or handcrafted heuristic rules to find appropriate pruning rates
individually for each layer. This approach generally leads to suboptimal
performance. In this paper, by directly working on the probability space, we
propose an effective network sparsification method called {\it probabilistic
masking} (ProbMask), which solves a natural sparsification formulation under
global sparsity constraint. The key idea is to use probability as a global
criterion for all layers to measure the weight importance. An appealing feature
of ProbMask is that the amounts of weight redundancy can be learned
automatically via our constraint and thus we avoid the problem of tuning
pruning rates individually for different layers in a network. Extensive
experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
is highly effective, and can outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a
significant margin, especially in the high pruning rate situation. Notably, the
gap of Top-1 accuracy between our ProbMask and existing methods can be up to
10\%. As a by-product, we show ProbMask is also highly effective in identifying
supermasks, which are subnetworks with high performance in a randomly weighted

sampling. Starting from a known probability distribution, the homotopy
procedure generates the unknown normalization of a target distribution. In the
context of stationary distributions that are associated with physical systems
the method is an alternative way to estimate an unknown microcanonical
ensemble. The process is iterative and also generates samples from the target
distribution. In practice, the homotopy procedure does not circumvent using
sample averages in the estimation of the normalization constant. The error in
the procedure depends on the errors incurred in sample averaging and the number
of stages used in the computational implementation of the process. However, we
show that it is possible to exchange the number of homotopy stages and the
total number of samples needed at each stage in order to enhance the
computational efficiency of the implemented algorithm. Estimates of the error
as a function of stages and sample averages are derived. These could guide
computational efficiency decisions on how the calculation would be mapped to a
given computer architecture. Consideration is given to how the procedure can be
adapted to Bayesian estimation problems, both stationary and non-stationary.
Emphasis is placed on the non-stationary problems, and in particular, on a
sequential estimation technique known as particle filtering. It is shown that a
modification of the particle filter framework to include the homotopy process
can improve the computational robustness of particle filters. The homotopy
process can ameliorate particle filter collapse, a common challenge to using
particle filters when the sample dimension is small compared with the state

less computational efforts, less resources for acquiring channel state

to learn in a dynamic environment.
  This work develops a new approach that enables data-driven methods to
continuously learn and optimize resource allocation strategies in a dynamic

the environment statistics change in ``episodes"", and in each episode the
environment is stationary. We propose to build the notion of continual learning

formulation which ensures certain ``fairness"" across different data samples. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the CL approach by integrating it with two
popular DNN based models for power control and beamforming, respectively, and
testing using both synthetic and ray-tracing based data sets. These numerical
results show that the proposed CL approach is not only able to adapt to the new

= 0.046) and faster than usual during cognitive tasks (p = 2 x 10^-5). Then, we
group together the experimental segments associated with fast, slow, and normal
POTP, and train a ML model to classify between these states based on a person's
biomarkers. The classifier had a weighted average F-1 score of 79%, with the
fast-passing time class having the highest F-1 score of 93%. Next, we classify
each individual's POTP regardless of the task at hand, achieving an F-1 score
of 77.1% when distinguishing time passing faster rather than slower than usual.
In the two classifiers, biomarkers derived from the respiration,
electrocardiogram, skin conductance, and skin temperature signals contributed
most to the classifier output, thus enabling real-time POTP monitoring using
noninvasive, wearable biosensors.

  Inhibitory Inputs for Energy-Efficient Photonic Spiking Neural Networks","24 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.NE physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We designed, prototyped, and experimentally demonstrated, for the first time
to our knowledge, an optoelectronic spiking neuron inspired by the Izhikevich
model incorporating both excitatory and inhibitory optical spiking inputs and
producing optical spiking outputs accordingly. The optoelectronic neurons
consist of three transistors acting as electrical spiking circuits, a
vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) for optical spiking outputs, and
two photodetectors for excitatory and inhibitory optical spiking inputs.
Additional inclusion of capacitors and resistors complete the
Izhikevich-inspired optoelectronic neurons, which receive excitatory and
inhibitory optical spikes as inputs from other optoelectronic neurons. We
developed a detailed optoelectronic neuron model in Verilog-A and simulated the
circuit-level operation of various cases with excitatory input and inhibitory
input signals. The experimental results closely resemble the simulated results
and demonstrate how the excitatory inputs trigger the optical spiking outputs
while the inhibitory inputs suppress the outputs. Utilizing the simulated
neuron model, we conducted simulations using fully connected (FC) and
convolutional neural networks (CNN). The simulation results using MNIST
handwritten digits recognition show 90% accuracy on unsupervised learning and
97% accuracy on a supervised modified FC neural network. We further designed a
nanoscale optoelectronic neuron utilizing quantum impedance conversion where a
200 aJ/spike input can trigger the output from on-chip nanolasers with 10
fJ/spike. The nanoscale neuron can support a fanout of ~80 or overcome 19 dB
excess optical loss while running at 10 GSpikes/second in the neural network,
which corresponds to 100x throughput and 1000x energy-efficiency improvement
compared to state-of-art electrical neuromorphic hardware such as Loihi and
NeuroGrid.

detecting and observing the spread of misinformation about this disease within
texts. CMTA proposes a data science (DS) pipeline that applies machine learning
models for processing, classifying (Dense-CNN) and analyzing (MBERT)
multilingual (micro)-texts. DS pipeline data preparation tasks extract features
from multilingual textual data and categorize it into specific information
classes (i.e., 'false', 'partly false', 'misleading'). The CMTA pipeline has
been experimented with multilingual micro-texts (tweets), showing
misinformation spread across different languages. To assess the performance of
CMTA and put it in perspective, we performed a comparative analysis of CMTA
with eight monolingual models used for detecting misinformation. The comparison
shows that CMTA has surpassed various monolingual models and suggests that it
can be used as a general method for detecting misinformation in multilingual
micro-texts. CMTA experimental results show misinformation trends about
COVID-19 in different languages during the first pandemic months.

  Ray-Tracing",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter wave (mmWave) is a practical solution to provide high data rate
for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. This enables the future
autonomous vehicles to exchange big data with the base stations (BSs) such as
the velocity, and the location to enhance the safety for the advanced driving
assistance system (ADAS). To achieve this goal, we propose to develop a
situational rate map to characterize the distribution of the rates achieved
between the BSs and a uniform grid of vehicles. In this context, we consider a
mmWave 5G cellular system with two physical structures which are the
analog-only beamforming and hybrid precoding with limited feedback to
investigate the rate distribution for single and multiuser scenarios. We will
use the Ray-Tracing tool to construct the simulation environment and generate
the channels between the BSs and the grid of vehicles. Finally, we will study
the effects of the carrier frequency, the bandwidth, the BSs deployment, the
blockage, the codebook, the physical architectures and the number of served
users on the rate distribution maps. Moreover, we will present the rate
statistics to evaluate the coverage of served users for certain services
requirements and for various road shapes such as corners, intersections and
straightways.

small-world phenomena, it also has great relevance for practical problems
involving networked dynamical systems. To study the impact of the clustering
coefficient on dynamical processes taking place on networks, some authors have
focused on the construction of graphs with tunable clustering coefficients.
These constructions are usually realized through a stochastic process, either
by growing a network through the preferential attachment procedure, or by
applying a random rewiring process. In contrast, we consider here several
families of static graphs whose clustering coefficients can be determined
explicitly. The basis for these families is formed by the $k$-regular graphs on
$N$ nodes, that belong to the family of so-called circulant graphs denoted by
$C_{N,k}$. We show that the expression for the clustering coefficient of
$C_{N,k}$ reported in literature, only holds for sufficiently large $N$. Next,
we consider three generalizations of the circulant graphs, either by adding
some pendant links to $C_{N,k}$, or by connecting, in two different ways, an
additional node to some nodes of $C_{N,k}$. For all three generalizations, we
derive explicit expressions for the clustering coefficient. Finally, we
construct a family of pairs of generalized circulant graphs, with the same
number of nodes and links, but with different clustering coefficients.

schemes. Photonic crystal slabs (PCS) offer a miniaturized platform for
wideband, sensitive ultrasound detection by exploiting the photoelastic effect
in water. However, poor modal overlap with the sensing medium and
non-negligible absorption loss of the aqueous medium have previously limited
PCS sensor performance. In this study, we detail the development and
optimization of a PCS-based acoustic sensor, by adding to it a low-loss
high-index polymer cladding layer. Exploiting a mode-optimized TM-like optical
resonance present in a PCS, with high bulk index sensitivity (>600 nm/RIU) and
quality factor Q (>8000), we demonstrate real-time ultrasound-sensing at a
noise equivalent pressure (NEP) of 170 Pa (1.9 Pa/rt Hz). The PCS sensor is
backside-coupled to optical fiber which, along with its intensity-based
ultrasound-sensing architecture, will allow us to scale up easily to a 2D
array. This work paves the way to a sensitive compact ultrasound detector for
photoacoustic-based diagnostics and monitoring of tissue.
