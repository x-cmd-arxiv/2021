introduce EiGLasso, a highly scalable method for sparse Kronecker-sum inverse

eigendecomposition of the two graphs for exploiting the structure of Kronecker

achieves quadratic convergence with the exact Hessian and linear convergence
with the approximate Hessian. We describe a simple new approach to estimating

due to the use of frame-mounted motors that reduce the moving mass of the
printer while allowing for the use of (heavy) higher torque motors. However,
the H-frame's dynamic accuracy is limited during high-acceleration and
high-speed motion due to racking -- i.e., parasitic torsional motions of the
printer's gantry due to a force couple. Mechanical solutions to the racking
problem are either costly or detract from the simplicity of the H-frame. In
this paper, we introduce a feedforward software compensation algorithm, based
on the filtered B-splines (FBS) method, that rectifies errors due to racking.
The FBS approach expresses the motion command to the machine as a linear
combination of B-splines. The B-splines are filtered through an identified
model of the machine dynamics and the control points of the B-spline based
motion command are optimized such that the tracking error is minimized. To
compensate racking using the FBS algorithm, an accurate frequency response
function of the racking motion is obtained and coupled to the H-frame's x- and
y-axis dynamics with a kinematic model. The result is a coupled linear
parameter varying model of the H-frame that is utilized in the FBS framework to
compensate racking. An approximation of the proposed racking compensation
algorithm, that decouples the x- and y-axis compensation, is developed to
significantly improve its computational efficiency with almost no loss of
compensation accuracy. Experiments on an H-frame 3D printer demonstrate a 43

a more accessible low-cost solution, we present a new approach to keypoint
detection and apply it to predict dart scores from a single image taken from
any camera angle. This problem involves detecting multiple keypoints that may
be of the same class and positioned in close proximity to one another. The
widely adopted framework for regressing keypoints using heatmaps is not
well-suited for this task. To address this issue, we instead propose to model
keypoints as objects. We develop a deep convolutional neural network around
this idea and use it to predict dart locations and dartboard calibration points
within an overall pipeline for automatic dart scoring, which we call DeepDarts.
Additionally, we propose several task-specific data augmentation strategies to
improve the generalization of our method. As a proof of concept, two datasets
comprising 16k images originating from two different dartboard setups were
manually collected and annotated to evaluate the system. In the primary dataset
containing 15k images captured from a face-on view of the dartboard using a
smartphone, DeepDarts predicted the total score correctly in 94.7% of the test
images. In a second more challenging dataset containing limited training data
(830 images) and various camera angles, we utilize transfer learning and
extensive data augmentation to achieve a test accuracy of 84.0%. Because
DeepDarts relies only on single images, it has the potential to be deployed on
edge devices, giving anyone with a smartphone access to an automatic dart
scoring system for steel-tip darts. The code and datasets are available.

popular professional sports leagues in the world, but also one of the toughest
competitions to predict. The first purpose of this research was to verify the
consistency between goal scoring in the English Premier League and the Poisson
process; specifically, the relationships between the number of goals scored in
a match and the Poisson distribution, the time between goals throughout the
course of a season and the exponential distribution, and the time location of
goals during football games and the continuous uniform distribution. We found
that the Poisson process and the three probability distributions accurately
describe Premier League goal scoring. In addition, Poisson regression was
utilized to predict outcomes for a Premier League season, using different sets
of season data and with a large number of simulations being involved. We
examined and compared various soccer metrics from our simulation results,
including an English club's chances of being the champions, finishing in the
top four and bottom three, and relegation points.

neutral acoustic waves in a magnetic arcade in the lower solar atmosphere. By
means of numerical simulations, we aim to: (a) study two-fluid waves
propagating in a magnetic arcade embedded in the partially-ionized, lower solar
atmosphere; and (b) investigate the impact of the background magnetic field
configuration on the observed wave-periods. We consider a 2D approximation of
the gravitationally stratified and partially-ionized lower solar atmosphere
consisting of ion+electron and neutral fluids that are coupled by ion-neutral
collisions. In this model, the convection below the photosphere is responsible
for the excitation of ion magnetoacoustic-gravity and neutral acoustic-gravity
waves. We find that in the solar photosphere, where ions and neutrals are
strongly coupled by collisions, ion magnetoacoustic-gravity and neutral
acoustic-gravity waves have periods ranging from 250 s to 350 s. In the
chromosphere, where the collisional coupling is weak, the wave characteristics
strongly depend on the magnetic field configuration. Above the foot-points of
the considered arcade, the plasma is dominated by a vertical magnetic field
along which ion magnetoacoustic-gravity waves propagate. These waves exhibit a
broad range of periods with the most prominent periods of 180 s, 220 s, and 300
s. Above the main loop of the solar arcade, where mostly horizontal magnetic
field lines guide ion magnetoacoustic-gravity waves, the main spectral power
reduces to the period of about 180 s and longer wave-periods do not exist. Our
results are in agreement with the recent observational data reported by
Wi\'sniewska et al. (2016) and Kayshap et al. (2018).

  Sub-Weibull Errors",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a stochastic operator framework to analyze the
convergence of iterative algorithms for both static and online optimization
with: (i) stochastic errors in the algorithmic steps, and (ii) random
coordinate updates. To this end, the paper focuses on operators of the form $\T
\x = (\T_1 \x, \ldots, \T_n \x)$, defined over the direct sum of possibly
infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and investigates the convergence of the
associated stochastic Banach-Picard iteration. Results in terms of convergence
in mean and in high-probability are presented when the errors affecting the
operator follow a sub-Weibull distribution, and when updates $\T_i \x$ are
performed based on a Bernoulli random variable. In particular, the results are
derived for the cases where $\T$ is component-wise contractive and averaged,
with results in terms of convergence to the unique fixed point and cumulative
fixed-point residual, respectively. Links with exiting results in terms of
almost sure convergence are provided. In the online optimization context, the
operator changes at each iteration to reflect changes in the underlying
optimization problem. This leads to an online Banach-Picard iteration, and
similar results are derived where the bounds for the convergence in mean and
high-probability further depend on the evolution of fixed points (\emph{i.e.},
optimal solutions of the time-varying optimization problem).

Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets (2D bismuth oxycarbonate, 2D bismutite) are fabricated via
sonochemically-assisted template-free synthesis. Key to the synthesis of the
freestanding, laterally large 2D Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets from bulk Bi powder is
choice of suspension medium, controlled reaction temperatures and several hours
processing time. Lateral sizes of 2D Bi2O2CO3 can be controlled between
micrometer-sized nanosheets and tens of nm sized nanoflakes solely based on the
choice of suspension medium. The here introduced 2D Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets/-flakes
are then hybridized by a simple mix-and-match approach with TiO2 nanoparticles
for testing in suspension-type photocatalytic hydrogen production via water
splitting. This introduces the 2D Bi2O2CO3 with TiO2 as a promising
noble-metal-free co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Our results
enrich the fabrication toolbox of emerging 2D pnictogen oxycarbonates towards
large 2D nanosheets and demonstrate the promising potential of 2D Bi2O2CO3 as
an advantageous (co-)catalyst for hydrogen evolution in photocatalytic water
splitting.

retrieval techniques. Most phase retrieval algorithms make the solution
well-posed by relying on the constraints imposed by the overlapping region

that the object can be faithfully reconstructed at low overlap ratios by
regularizing the phase retrieval algorithm with image priors such as
Total-Variation and Structure Tensor Prior. We also show the effectiveness of

solution to this problem is to offload data-reducing processing and filtering

However, identifying early radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) and confirming
this scenario has been hard to accomplish, with studies of samples of radio AGN
hosts at z>2 becoming routinely possible only recently. With the above in mind,
we have carried out a survey with the Atacama Compact Array (ACA, or Morita

within 3.9deg2 in the ELAIS-S1 field. The work presented here describes the
survey and showcases a preliminary set of results. The selection of the sample
was based on three criteria making use of infrared (IR) and radio fluxes only.
The criterion providing the highest selection rate of high-redshift sources
(86% at z>0.8) is one combining an IR colour cut and radio flux cut
(S(5.8um)/S(3.6um)>1.3 and S(1.4GHz)>1mJy). Among the sample of 36 sources, 16

origin, shows a clear spatial offset between the jet-dominated mm continuum
emission and that of the host's molecular gas, as traced by serendipitously

the connection? We offer the following answer: In a previous paper we have
shown that the gap condition arises from an iterative construction on
transformations of partial orders. Here we show that the parallel construction
for linear orders yields familiar collapsing functions. The iteration step in
the linear case is an instance of a general construction that we call
`Bachmann-Howard derivative'. In the present paper, we focus on the unary case,
i.e., on the gap condition for sequences rather than trees and,
correspondingly, on addition-free ordinal notation systems. This is partly for
convenience, but it also allows us to clarify a phenomenon that is specific to
the unary setting: As shown by van der Meeren, Rathjen and Weiermann, the gap
condition on sequences admits two linearizations with rather different
properties. We will see that these correspond to different recursive

that it results in a polynomial-time algorithm for curves in 1D with intervals

finding the optimal placement of vertices seems more difficult than the regular
Fr\'echet distance -- and indeed we can easily prove that the problem is
NP-hard in 2D -- the optimal placement of vertices in 1D can be computed in
polynomial time. Finally, we investigate the discrete weak Fr\'echet distance,
for which, somewhat surprisingly, the problem is NP-hard already in 1D.

for the simultaneous unfolding of all observables in a given phase space
region, there is a new opportunity to blur these traditional boundaries by
performing searches on unfolded data. This could facilitate a research program
where data are explored in their natural high dimensionality with as little
model bias as possible. We study how the information about physics beyond the
Standard Model is preserved by full phase space unfolding using an important
physics target at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC): exotic Higgs boson decays
involving hadronic final states. We find that if the signal cross section is
high enough, information about the new physics is visible in the unfolded data.
We will show that in some cases, quantifiably all of the information about the
new physics is encoded in the unfolded data. Finally, we show that there are
still many cases when the unfolding does not work fully or precisely, such as
when the signal cross section is small. This study will serve as an important
benchmark for enhancing unfolding methods for the LHC and beyond.

been studied in great depth. However, many systems in the real-world do not
result in all agents eventually reaching consensus, but rather in the opposite:
they converge to a state of rich diversity. Consider for example task
allocation in ants. If eventually all ants perform the same task, then the
colony will perish (lack of food, no brood care, etc.). Then, it is vital for
the survival of the colony to have a diverse set of tasks and enough ants
working on each task. What complicates matters is that ants need to switch
tasks periodically to adjust the needs of the colony; e.g., when too many
foragers fell victim to other ant colonies. Moreover, all tasks are equally
important and maybe they need to keep certain proportions in the distribution
of the task. How can ants keep a healthy and balanced allocation of tasks?
  To answer this question, we propose a simple population protocol for $n$
agents on a complete graph and an arbitrary initial distribution of $k$ colours
(tasks). We assume that each colour $i$ has an associated weight (importance)
$w_i \geq 1$. By denoting $w$ as the sum of the weights of different colours,
we show that the protocol converges in $O(w^2 n \log n)$ rounds to a
configuration where the number of agents supporting each colour $i$ is
concentrated on the fair share $w_in/w$ and will stay concentrated for a large
number of rounds, w.h.p.
  Our protocol has many interesting properties: agents do not need to know
other colours and weights in the system, and our protocol requires very little
memory per agent. Furthermore, the protocol guarantees fairness meaning that
over a long period each agent has each colour roughly a number of times
proportional to the weight of the colour. Finally, our protocol also fulfils
sustainability meaning that no colour ever vanishes.

reconstruct the relative phases between different measurement locations at all

  Experiment","26 pages, 6 figures, 2 Tables",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Learned systems in the domain of visual recognition and cognition impress in
part because even though they are trained with datasets many orders of
magnitude smaller than the full population of possible images, they exhibit
sufficient generalization to be applicable to new and previously unseen data.
Since training data sets typically represent small sampling of a domain, the
possibility of bias in their composition is very real. But what are the limits
of generalization given such bias, and up to what point might it be sufficient
for a real problem task? Although many have examined issues regarding
generalization, this question may require examining the data itself. Here, we
focus on the characteristics of the training data that may play a role. Other
disciplines have grappled with these problems, most interestingly epidemiology,
where experimental bias is a critical concern. The range and nature of data
biases seen clinically are really quite relatable to learned vision systems.
One obvious way to deal with bias is to ensure a large enough training set, but
this might be infeasible for many domains. Another approach might be to perform
a statistical analysis of the actual training set, to determine if all aspects
of the domain are fairly captured. This too is difficult, in part because the
full set of variables might not be known, or perhaps not even knowable. Here,
we try a different approach in the tradition of the Thought Experiment, whose
most famous instance may be Schr\""odinger's Cat. There are many types of bias
as will be seen, but we focus only on one, selection bias. The point of the
thought experiment is not to demonstrate problems with all learned systems.
Rather, this might be a simple theoretical tool to probe into bias during data
collection to highlight deficiencies that might then deserve extra attention
either in data collection or system development.

consistency checks, we argue that this axion potential vanishes in the presence

luminosities may exceed $10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and last from hours to days. The
brightest explosions occur in regions of reduced density; either off-plane, or
in discs around low-mass central black holes ($\sim 10^6\ M_\odot$), or in
starved subluminous AGNs. Explosions in the latter two sites are easier to
observe due to a reduced AGN background luminosity. We perform suites of 1D
Lagrangian radiative hydrodynamics SNEC code simulations to validate our
results and obtain the luminosity in different bands, and 2D axisymmetric
Eulerian hydrodynamics code HORMONE simulations to study the morphology of the
ejecta and its deviation from spherical symmetry. The observed signature is
expected to be a bright blue, UV, or X-ray flare on top of the AGN luminosity
from the initial shock breakout, while the subsequent red part of the
lightcurve will largely be unobservable. We estimate the upper limit for the
total event rate to be $\mathcal{R}\lesssim 100\ \rm yr^{-1}\ Gpc^{-3}$ for
optimal conditions and discuss the large uncertainties in this estimate. Future
high-cadence transient searches may reveal these events. Some existing tidal
disruption event candidates may originate from AGN supernovae.

the cores.
  Majority of galaxies in our sample are more morphologically disturbed than
regular galaxies (88%, corresponding to >3$\sigma$ significance) when observed
with HST, with asymmetry and S\'ersic residual flux fraction being the most
successful measures of disturbance. Most disturbances are undetected at the
lower resolution of SDSS imaging. Although ~27% galaxies are clear merger

internal, caused by small-scale perturbations or dust substructures rather than
tidal features, and require high-resolution imaging to detect. We found a
2.8$\sigma$ evidence that asymmetry features fade on timescales ~200 Myr, and

the low-order photon rings, can break this degeneracy and produce mass and spin
measurements independent of the shape of the rings. We describe two potential

different emission locations. This method is conceptually similar to spacetime

breaks the near-perfect degeneracy between emission location, mass, and spin

conceivably refractories coming from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
  In this work, we extend the investigation to the second COPS gauge, the nude

particles, along with a search for possible dependencies between the nude gauge
detection rate (i.e. the rate at which icy particles are detected by the nude
gauge) and the position of the Rosetta spacecraft. We also investigate the
correlations of the nude gauge detection rate with the quantities associated
with cometary activity.
  Although it was not originally designed for such a purpose, the COPS nude
gauge has been able to detect $\sim$67000 features generated by the sublimation
of the volatile content of icy particles. The nude gauge detection rate follows
a trend that is inversely proportional to the heliocentric distance. This
result is interpreted as a confirmation of a possible relation between the nude
gauge detection rate and cometary activity. Thus, we compared the former with
parameters related to cometary activity and obtained significant correlations,
indicating that the frequency of icy particle detection is driven by cometary
activity. Furthermore, by representing the volatile part of the icy particles
as equivalent spheres with a density of 1 g cm$^{-3}$, we obtained a range of
diameters between 60 and 793 nanometres, with the smaller ones

Long-period, double-lined spectroscopic binaries that are also resolved
astrometrically offer an alternative for obtaining absolute masses of stellar
objects. 9 Sgr is one such long-period, high-mass binary. Unfortunately, a
large amount of tension exists between its total dynamical mass inferred from
radial velocity measurements and that from astrometric data. We obtained the
astrometric orbit from VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric
measurements. Using archival and new spectroscopy, we performed a grid-based
spectral disentangling search to constrain the semi-amplitudes of the radial
velocity curves. We computed atmospheric parameters and surface abundances by
adjusting \textsc{fastwind} atmosphere models and we compared our results with
evolutionary tracks computed with the Bonn Evolutionary Code (BEC). Grid
spectral disentangling of 9 Sgr supports the presence of a 53 M${}_\odot$
primary and a 39 M${}_\odot$ secondary. Comparison with BEC evolutionary tracks
shows the components of 9 Sgr are most likely coeval with an age of roughly 1
Myr. Our analysis clears up the contradiction between mass and orbital
inclination estimates reported in previous studies. We detect the presence of
significant CNO-processed material at the surface of the primary, suggesting
enhanced internal mixing compared to currently implemented in the BEC models.
The present measurements provide a high-quality high-mass anchor to validate
stellar evolution models and to test the efficiency of internal mixing
processes.

individual galaxies (via, e.g., mergers and/or AGN feedback) or from the
inclusion of larger galaxies entering the selection at later epochs (progenitor
bias). We here build a data-driven, flexible theoretical framework to probe the
structural evolution of MGs. We assign galaxies to dark matter haloes via
stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relations with varying high-mass slopes and
scatters $\sigma_{\rm SMHM}$ in stellar mass at fixed halo mass, and assign
sizes to galaxies using an empirically-motivated, constant and linear
relationship between $R_e$ and the host dark matter halo radius $R_h$. We find
that: 1) the fast mean size growth of MGs is well reproduced independently of
the shape of the input SMHM relation; 2) the numbers of compact MGs grow
steadily until $z\gtrsim2$ and fall off at lower redshifts, suggesting a lesser
role of progenitor bias at later epochs; 3) a time-independent scatter
$\sigma_{\rm SMHM}$ is consistent with a scenario in which compact starforming
MGs transition into quiescent MGs in a few $10^8$yr with a negligible
structural evolution during the compact phase, while a scatter increasing at
high redshift implies significant size growth during the starforming phase. A
robust measurement of the size function of MGs at high redshift can set strong
constraints on the scatter of the SMHM relation and, by extension, on models of
galaxy evolution.

leading to differences in galaxy gas content and star formation. We use
hydrodynamic cosmological simulations including in situ multifrequency
radiative transfer to evaluate the effects of a high binary fraction in
reionization-era galaxies on traits of the early intergalactic medium and the
abundance of H I and He II ionizing photons. We further extend this to analyze
the traits of enriched gas. In comparing metrics generated using a fiducial
simulation assuming single stars with one incorporating a high binary fraction,
we find that binary stars cause H I reionization to complete earlier and at an
accelerated pace, while also increasing the abundances of high-ionization
metals (C IV and Si IV) in simulated absorption spectra while reducing the
abundance of low-ionization states (O I, Si II, and C II). However, through
increased photoheating of galactic and circumgalactic gas, they simultaneously
reduce the rate of star formation in low-mass galaxies, slowing the ongoing
process of enrichment and suppressing their own ionizing background. This
potentially contributes to a slower He II reionization process at $z\geq5$, and
further indicates that self-regulation of galaxies could be underestimated when

thins down and eventually pinches off. Adding solid particles to the liquid
phase leads to a more complex dynamic, notably by increasing the shear
viscosity. Moreover, it introduces an additional length scale to the system,
the diameter of the particles, which eventually becomes comparable to the
diameter of the ligament. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the
thinning and pinch-off of drops of suspensions with two different sizes of
particles. We characterize the thinning for different particle size ratios and
different proportions of small particles. Long before the pinch-off, the
thinning rate is that of an equivalent liquid whose viscosity is that of the
suspension. Later, when the ligament thickness approaches the size of the large
particles, the thinning accelerates and leads to an early pinch-off. We explain
how the bidisperse particle size distribution lowers the viscosity by making
the packing more efficient, which speeds up the thinning. This result can be
used to predict the dynamics of droplet formation with bidisperse suspensions.

learning model under noisy information. Focusing on group fairness metrics, we
investigate the particular but common situation when the evaluation requires
controlling for the confounding effect of covariate variables. In a practical
setting, we might not be able to jointly observe the covariate and group
information, and a standard workaround is to then use proxies for one or more
of these variables. Prior works have demonstrated the challenges with using a
proxy for sensitive attributes, and strong independence assumptions are needed
to provide guarantees on the accuracy of the noisy estimates. In contrast, in
this work we study using a proxy for the covariate variable and present a
theoretical analysis that aims to characterize weaker conditions under which
accurate fairness evaluation is possible.
  Furthermore, our theory identifies potential sources of errors and decouples
them into two interpretable parts $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$. The first part
$\gamma$ depends solely on the performance of the proxy such as precision and
recall, whereas the second part $\epsilon$ captures correlations between all
the variables of interest. We show that in many scenarios the error in the
estimates is dominated by $\gamma$ via a linear dependence, whereas the
dependence on the correlations $\epsilon$ only constitutes a lower order term.
As a result we expand the understanding of scenarios where measuring model
fairness via proxies can be an effective approach. Finally, we compare, via
simulations, the theoretical upper-bounds to the distribution of simulated
estimation errors and show that assuming some structure on the data, even weak,
is key to significantly improve both theoretical guarantees and empirical
results.

widespread monitoring elusive. Here, we investigate temporal prediction of
VO$_2$ from wearable sensors during cycle ergometer exercise using a temporal
convolutional network (TCN). Cardiorespiratory signals were acquired from a
smart shirt with integrated textile sensors alongside ground-truth VO$_2$ from
a metabolic system on twenty-two young healthy adults. Participants performed
one ramp-incremental and three pseudorandom binary sequence exercise protocols
to assess a range of VO$_2$ dynamics. A TCN model was developed using causal
convolutions across an effective history length to model the time-dependent
nature of VO$_2$. Optimal history length was determined through minimum
validation loss across hyperparameter values. The best performing model encoded
218 s history length (TCN-VO$_2$ A), with 187 s, 97 s, and 76 s yielding less
than 3% deviation from the optimal validation loss. TCN-VO$_2$ A showed strong
prediction accuracy (mean, 95% CI) across all exercise intensities (-22
ml.min$^{-1}$, [-262, 218]), spanning transitions from low-moderate (-23
ml.min$^{-1}$, [-250, 204]), low-high (14 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-252, 280]),
ventilatory threshold-high (-49 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-274, 176]), and maximal (-32
ml.min$^{-1}$, [-261, 197]) exercise. Second-by-second classification of
physical activity across 16090 s of predicted VO$_2$ was able to discern
between vigorous, moderate, and light activity with high accuracy (94.1%). This
system enables quantitative aerobic activity monitoring in non-laboratory

monitoring exercise prescription adherence and personal fitness.

planets around M-dwarfs close to the Sun would show detectable signals at

reconstruction methods tailored for diffuse surfaces fail disgracefully. In
this paper, we introduce a fixed viewpoint approach to dense surface
reconstruction of transparent objects based on refraction of light. We present
a simple setup that allows us to alter the incident light paths before light
rays enter the object by immersing the object partially in a liquid, and
develop a method for recovering the object surface through reconstructing and
triangulating such incident light paths. Our proposed approach does not need to
model the complex interactions of light as it travels through the object,
neither does it assume any parametric form for the object shape nor the exact
number of refractions and reflections taken place along the light paths. It can
therefore handle transparent objects with a relatively complex shape and
structure, with unknown and inhomogeneous refractive index. We also show that
for thin transparent objects, our proposed acquisition setup can be further
simplified by adopting a single refraction approximation. Experimental results
on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our
proposed approach.

composition, and there was no effect on the number of trees cut. Species
richness increased in areas where canopy cover was higher and it decreases as
it becomes more distant from the watercourse. The occurrences of preferred

periods. Most USP planets have radii $<$ 2 $R_{\oplus}$, while planets that
orbit further from their star extend to Jupiter size ($>$ 10 $R_{\oplus}$).
Several theories attempt to explain the formation and composition of USP
planets: they could be remnant cores of larger gas giants that lost their
atmospheres due to photo-evaporation or Roche lobe overflow, or they could have
developed through mass accretion in the innermost part of the protoplanetary
disk. The radius and mass distribution of USP planets could provide important
clues to distinguish between potential formation mechanisms. In this study, we
first verify and update the Kepler catalog of USP planet host star properties,
incorporating new data collected by the Gaia mission where applicable. We then
use the transit depths measured by Kepler to derive a radius distribution and
present occurrence rates for USP planets. Using spherical and tidally distorted
planet models, we then derive a mass distribution for USP planets. Comparisons
between the updated USP planet mass distribution and simulated planetary
systems offer further insights into the formation and evolutionary processes

Specifically, the Mo-$d_{xy}$ orbitals form robust molecular-orbital states

remain delocalized and itinerant. Our study shows that MoOCl$_2$ is globally
metallic, with the Mo-$d_{xy}$ orbital bonding-antibonding splittings opening a

graphs and rooted product graphs. Specifically, we give several tight lower and
upper bounds for the Roman domination number of direct product graphs involving
some parameters of the factors, which include the domination, (total) Roman
domination, and packing numbers among others. On the other hand, we prove that
the Roman domination number of rooted product graphs can attain only three
possible values, which depend on the order, the domination, and the Roman

understanding of light-matter interaction and ultrafast optoelectronic
applications. For visible light the bandwidth of photoconductive sampling of
fields and field-induced dynamics can be extended to the petahertz domain.
Despite the growing importance of ultrafast photoconductive measurements, a
rigorous model for connecting the microscopic electron dynamics to the
macroscopic external signal is lacking. This has caused conflicting
interpretations about the origin of macroscopic currents. Here, we present
systematic experimental studies on the macroscopic signal formation of
ultrafast currents in gases. We developed a theoretical model based on the
Ramo-Shockley-theorem that overcomes the previously introduced artificial
separation into dipole and current contributions. Extensive numerical
particle-in-cell (PIC)-type simulations based on this model permit a
quantitative comparison with experimental results and help to identify the
roles of electron scattering and Coulomb interactions. The results imply that
most of the heuristic models utilized so far will need to be amended. Our
approach can aid in the design of more sensitive and more efficient
photoconductive devices. We demonstrate for the case of gases that over an
order of magnitude increase in signal is achievable, paving the way towards
petahertz field measurements with the highest sensitivity.

optimize machine learning models that can interpolate the training data. The
main algorithmic differences are that (1) SPS employs a multiplicative constant
in the denominator of the learning-rate while ALI-G uses an additive constant,
and (2) SPS uses an iteration-dependent maximal learning-rate while ALI-G uses
a constant one. There are also differences in the analysis provided by the two
works, with less restrictive assumptions proposed in (Loizou et al., 2021). In
their experiments, (Loizou et al., 2021) did not use momentum for ALI-G (which
is a standard part of the algorithm) or standard hyper-parameter tuning (for
e.g. learning-rate and regularization). Hence this note as a reference for the
improved performance that ALI-G can obtain with well-chosen hyper-parameters.
In particular, we show that when training a ResNet-34 on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, the performance of ALI-G can reach respectively 93.5% (+6%) and 76%

affect the response time of a database system and can therefore affect the

tractable and fully frequentist framework to characterize and implement

dimensional model with dynamic mean vectors over multi-dimensional change axes.
Our theoretical analysis is carried out under a single two dimensional change
point setting. An optimal rate of convergence of the proposed estimator is
obtained, which in turn allows existence of limiting distributions.
Distributional behavior of change point estimates are split into two distinct
regimes, the limiting distributions under each regime is then characterized, in
turn allowing construction of asymptotically valid confidence intervals for
$2d$-location of change. All results are obtained under a high dimensional
scaling $s\log^2 p=o(T_wT_h),$ where $p$ is the response dimension, $s$ is a
sparsity parameter, and $T_w,T_h$ are sampling periods along change axes. We
characterize full regression trees by defining a multiple multi-dimensional

accurately ranking instruments prior to portfolio construction. While this
ranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting the
outputs produced by pointwise regression or classification techniques,
strategies using Learning to Rank algorithms have recently presented themselves
as competitive and viable alternatives. Although the rankers at the core of
these strategies are learned globally and improve ranking accuracy on average,
they ignore the differences between the distributions of asset features over
the times when the portfolio is rebalanced. This flaw renders them susceptible
to producing sub-optimal rankings, possibly at important periods when accuracy
is actually needed the most. For example, this might happen during critical
risk-off episodes, which consequently exposes the portfolio to substantial,
unwanted drawdowns. We tackle this shortcoming with an analogous idea from
information retrieval: that a query's top retrieved documents or the local
ranking context provide vital information about the query's own
characteristics, which can then be used to refine the initial ranked list. In
this work, we use a context-aware Learning-to-rank model that is based on the
Transformer architecture to encode top/bottom ranked assets, learn the context
and exploit this information to re-rank the initial results. Backtesting on a
slate of 31 currencies, our proposed methodology increases the Sharpe ratio by
around 30% and significantly enhances various performance metrics.
Additionally, this approach also improves the Sharpe ratio when separately

Recovering unobserved state variables is an important topic for the data
assimilation of turbulent systems. In this article, an efficient continuous in
time data assimilation scheme is developed, which exploits closed analytic
formulae for updating the unobserved state variables. Therefore, it is
computationally efficient and accurate. The new data assimilation scheme is
combined with a simple reduced order modeling technique that involves a cheap
closure approximation and a noise inflation. In such a way, many complicated
turbulent dynamical systems can satisfy the requirements of the mathematical
structures for the proposed efficient data assimilation scheme. The new data
assimilation scheme is then applied to the Sabra shell model, which is a
conceptual model for nonlinear turbulence. The goal is to recover the
unobserved shell velocities across different spatial scales. It has been shown
that the new data assimilation scheme is skillful in capturing the nonlinear
features of turbulence including the intermittency and extreme events in both
the chaotic and the turbulent dynamical regimes. It has also been shown that
the new data assimilation scheme is more accurate and computationally cheaper
than the standard ensemble Kalman filter and nudging data assimilation schemes

drop in brightness in the V photometric band in 2001 and a brightening in the
near-IR in 2002. Because the star possesses Herbig-Haro objects travelling in
outflowing bipolar jets, it was suggested that the drop in brightness was due
to a clump of dust entrained in a disk wind, blocking the line-on-sight toward
the star. In order to quantify this hypothesis, we investigated the brightness
drop at visible wavelengths and the brightening at near-IR wavelengths of HD
163296 using the Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer Code, HOCHUNK3D. We created
three models to understand the events. Model 1 describes the quiescent state of
the system. Model 2 describes the change in structure that led to the drop in
brightness in 2001. Model 3 describes the structure needed to produce the
observed 2002 brightening of the near-IR wavelengths. Models 2 and 3 utilize a
combination of a disk wind and central bipolar flow. By introducing a filled
bipolar cavity in Models 2 and 3, we were able to successfully simulate a
jet-like structure for the star with a disk wind and created the drop and
subsequent increase in brightness of the system. On the other hand, when the
bipolar cavity is not filled, Model 1 replicates the quiescent state of the
system.

of many important research directions in both computer vision and natural
language processing. In this task, given a series of natural language captions
which compose a story, an agent must generate a sequence of images that
correspond to the captions. Prior work has introduced recurrent generative
models which outperform text-to-image synthesis models on this task. However,
there is room for improvement of generated images in terms of visual quality,
coherence and relevance. We present a number of improvements to prior modeling
approaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that
utilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story
and generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for
sequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to
model complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to
demonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of
the model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.
Furthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard
evaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance. Therefore, we also
provide an exploration of evaluation metrics for the model, focused on aspects
of the generated frames such as the presence/quality of generated characters,
the relevance to captions, and the diversity of the generated images. We also
present correlation experiments of our proposed automated metrics with human
evaluations. Code and data available at:

it is accepted that intrinsic phonons change near boundaries $^{9,10}$, the
physical mechanisms and length-scales through which interfacial effects
influence materials remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrate the localized
vibrational response associated with the interfaces in SrTiO$_3$-CaTiO$_3$
superlattices by combining advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy
imaging and spectroscopy and density-functional-theory calculations. Symmetries
atypical of either constituent material are observed within a few atomic planes
near the interface. The local symmetries create local phonon modes that
determine the global response of the superlattice once the spacing of the
interfaces approaches the phonon spatial extent. The results provide direct
visualization and quantification, illustrating the progression of the local
symmetries and interface vibrations as they come to determine the vibrational
response of an entire superlattice; stated differently, the progression from a
material with interfaces, to a material dominated by interfaces, to a material
of interfaces as the period decreases. Direct observation of such local atomic
and vibrational phenomena demonstrates that their spatial extent needs to be
quantified to understand macroscopic behavior. Tailoring interfaces, and
knowing their local vibrational response, provides a means of pursuing designer
solids having emergent infrared and thermal responses.

generalized section-section interaction potentials (SSIP) within the
geometrically exact beam theory. By exploiting the fundamental kinematic
assumption of undeformable cross-sections, an objective (i.e., frame-invariant)
description of SSIPs via a minimal set of six (translational and rotational)
relative coordinates, either in spatial or in material form, is proposed. Based
on work-pairing, work-conjugated section-section interaction forces and
moments, either in spatial or in material form, are identified that can be
consistently derived from a variational principle. Interestingly, it is shown
that hyperelastic stored-energy functions relating the deformation measures and
stress-resultants of the well-known geometrically exact Simo-Reissner beam
theory can also be identified as SSIPs when considering the asymptotic limit of
small relative distances and rotations between the interacting cross-sections.
Moreover, the proposed variational problem formulation is demonstrated to be of
a very general nature, thus allowing for the formulation of translational and
rotational constraints between arbitrarily oriented cross-sections based on
either a penalty or a Lagrange multiplier potential. Possible applications
include fiber-based structures and materials in technical and biological
systems, where the proposed approach allows to model short- or long-ranged
inter-molecular (e.g., electrostatic, van der Waals or repulsive steric)
interactions between fibers in geometrically complex arrangements and to
formulate translational and rotational coupling constraints between different
fibers (e.g., cross-linked polymer chains) or between fibers and a matrix phase
(e.g., fiber-reinforced composites).

be learned. In this paper, we study the problem of how to imitate tasks when
there exist discrepancies between the expert and agent MDP. These discrepancies
across domains could include differing dynamics, viewpoint, or morphology; we
present a novel framework to learn correspondences across such domains.
Importantly, in contrast to prior works, we use unpaired and unaligned
trajectories containing only states in the expert domain, to learn this
correspondence. We utilize a cycle-consistency constraint on both the state
space and a domain agnostic latent space to do this. In addition, we enforce
consistency on the temporal position of states via a normalized position
estimator function, to align the trajectories across the two domains. Once this
correspondence is found, we can directly transfer the demonstrations on one
domain to the other and use it for imitation. Experiments across a wide variety
of challenging domains demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

connectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an
intention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and
multiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on
the Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is
about 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the
performance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an

handle a wide variety of tasks by forming a customized robot for each new task.
However, reconfiguring just the mechanism is not sufficient: each design also
requires its own unique control policy. One could craft a policy from scratch
for each new design, but such an approach is not scalable, especially given the
large number of designs that can be generated from even a small set of modules.
Instead, we create a modular policy framework where the policy structure is
conditioned on the hardware arrangement, and use just one training process to
create a policy that controls a wide variety of designs. Our approach leverages
the fact that the kinematics of a modular robot can be represented as a design
graph, with nodes as modules and edges as connections between them. Given a
robot, its design graph is used to create a policy graph with the same
structure, where each node contains a deep neural network, and modules of the
same type share knowledge via shared parameters (e.g., all legs on a hexapod
share the same network parameters). We developed a model-based reinforcement
learning algorithm, interleaving model learning and trajectory optimization to
train the policy. We show the modular policy generalizes to a large number of
designs that were not seen during training without any additional learning.
Finally, we demonstrate the policy controlling a variety of designs to locomote
with both simulated and real robots.

attacks. To address this problem, some researchers have proposed both offline

algorithms to identify such attacks. In this work, we take a different approach
to preventing data poisoning attacks which relies on cryptographically-based
authentication and provenance to ensure the integrity of the data used to train
a machine learning model. The same approach is also used to prevent software
poisoning and model poisoning attacks. A software poisoning attack maliciously
alters one or more software components used to train a model. Once the model
has been trained it can also be protected against model poisoning attacks which
seek to alter a model's predictions by modifying its underlying parameters or
structure. Finally, an evaluation set or test set can also be protected to
provide evidence if they have been modified by a second data poisoning attack.
To achieve these goals, we propose VAMP which extends the previously proposed
AMP system, that was designed to protect media objects such as images, video
files or audio clips, to the machine learning setting. We first provide
requirements for authentication and provenance for a secure machine learning
system. Next, we demonstrate how VAMP's manifest meets these requirements to
protect a machine learning system's datasets, software components, and models.

which a global server iteratively averages the model parameters of local users
without accessing their data. User heterogeneity has imposed significant
challenges to FL, which can incur drifted global models that are slow to
converge. Knowledge Distillation has recently emerged to tackle this issue, by
refining the server model using aggregated knowledge from heterogeneous users,
other than directly averaging their model parameters. This approach, however,
depends on a proxy dataset, making it impractical unless such a prerequisite is
satisfied. Moreover, the ensemble knowledge is not fully utilized to guide
local model learning, which may in turn affect the quality of the aggregated
model. Inspired by the prior art, we propose a data-free knowledge
distillation} approach to address heterogeneous FL, where the server learns a
lightweight generator to ensemble user information in a data-free manner, which
is then broadcasted to users, regulating local training using the learned
knowledge as an inductive bias. Empirical studies powered by theoretical
implications show that, our approach facilitates FL with better generalization
performance using fewer communication rounds, compared with the
state-of-the-art.

knowledge of the world through causal relationships. In addition to
observations, they can rely on experimenting and counterfactual reasoning --
i.e. referring to an alternative course of events -- to identify causal
relations and explain atypical situations. Different instances of control
systems, such as smart homes, would benefit from having a similar causal model,
as it would help the user understand the logic of the system and better react
when needed. However, while data-driven methods achieve high levels of
correlation detection, they mainly fall short of finding causal relations,
notably being limited to observations only. Notably, they struggle to identify
the cause from the effect when detecting a correlation between two variables.
This paper introduces a new way to learn causal models from a mixture of
experiments on the environment and observational data. The core of our method
is the use of selected interventions, especially our learning takes into
account the variables where it is impossible to intervene, unlike other
approaches. The causal model we obtain is then used to generate Causal Bayesian
Networks, which can be later used to perform diagnostic and predictive
inference. We use our method on a smart home simulation, a use case where
knowing causal relations pave the way towards explainable systems. Our
algorithm succeeds in generating a Causal Bayesian Network close to the
simulation's ground truth causal interactions, showing encouraging prospects
for application in real-life systems.

experiments and observational studies that finds the largest possible
unweighted samples across multiple treatment groups that are balanced relative
to a covariate profile. This covariate profile can represent a specific
population or a target individual, facilitating the generalization and
personalization of causal inferences. For generalization, because the profile
often amounts to summary statistics for a target population, profile matching
does not always require accessing individual-level data, which may be
unavailable for confidentiality reasons. For personalization, the profile
comprises the characteristics of a single individual. Profile matching achieves
covariate balance by construction, but unlike existing approaches to matching,
it does not require specifying a matching ratio, as this is implicitly
optimized for the data. The method can also be used for the selection of units
for study follow-up, and it readily applies to multi-valued treatments with
many treatment categories. We evaluate the performance of profile matching in a
simulation study of the generalization of a randomized trial to a target
population. We further illustrate this method in an exploratory observational
study of the relationship between opioid use and mental health outcomes. We
analyze these relationships for three covariate profiles representing: (i)
sexual minorities, (ii) the Appalachian United States, and (iii) the
characteristics of a hypothetical vulnerable patient. The method can be

without manually designing and fine tuning a reward function; 2) directly
controls the character without having to track any target reference pose
explicitly or implicitly through a phase state; and 3) supports interactive
policy switching without requiring any motion generation or motion matching
mechanism. We highlight the applicability of our approach in a range of
imitation and interactive control tasks, while also demonstrating its ability
to withstand external perturbations as well as to recover balance. Overall, our
approach generates high-fidelity motion, has low runtime cost, and can be
easily integrated into interactive applications and games.

individuals that can be utilized by designers as idealized sizing models. The
algorithm is based around a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Point-Net

identify a specified number of sizing groups. We demonstrate this technique on

hydrology, neuroscience and population dynamics. Although many chaotic systems
can be described by relatively simple dynamical equations, characterizing these
systems can be challenging, due to sensitivity to initial conditions and
difficulties in differentiating chaotic behavior from noise. Ideally, one
wishes to find a parsimonious set of equations that describe a dynamical
system. However, model selection is more challenging when only a subset of the
variables are experimentally accessible. Manifold learning methods using
time-delay embeddings can successfully reconstruct the underlying structure of
the system from data with hidden variables, but not the equations. Recent work
in sparse-optimization based model selection has enabled model discovery given
a library of possible terms, but regression-based methods require measurements
of all state variables. We present a method combining variational annealing --
a technique previously used for parameter estimation in chaotic systems with
hidden variables -- with sparse optimization methods to perform model
identification for chaotic systems with unmeasured variables. We applied the
method to experimental data from an electrical circuit with Lorenz-system like
behavior to successfully recover the circuit equations with two measured and
one hidden variable. We discuss the robustness of our method to varying noise

late phase in some solar flares, which is seen as a second peak in warm coronal
emissions ($\sim3$ MK) several tens of minutes to a few hours after the soft
X-ray (SXR) peak. The origin of the EUV late phase (ELP) is explained by either
a long-lasting cooling process in the long ELP loops, or a delayed energy
ejection into the ELP loops well after the main flare heating. Using the
observations with the \emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (\emph{SDO}), we
investigate the production of the ELP in six homologous flares (F1--F6)
originating from a complex active region (AR) NOAA 11283, with an emphasis on
the emission characteristics of the flares. It is found that the main
production mechanism of the ELP changes from additional heating in flare F1 to
long-lasting cooling in flares F3--F6, with both mechanisms playing a role in
flare F2. The transition is evidenced by an abrupt decrease of the time lag of
the ELP peak, and the long-lasting cooling process in the majority of the
flares is validated by a positive correlation between the flare ribbon fluence
and the ELP peak intensity. We attribute the change in ELP production mechanism
to an enhancement of the envelope magnetic field above the AR, which
facilitates a more prompt and energetic heating of the ELP loops. In addition,
the last and the only confined flare F6 exhibits an extremely large ELP. The
different emission pattern revealed in this flare may reflect a different
energy partitioning inside the ELP loops, which is due to a different magnetic
reconnection process.

and offline reinforcement learning problems for high-dimensional systems. This
work is motivated by the ongoing challenges of safety, computation, and
optimality in high-dimensional optimal control. We address these key questions
with the following approach. First, we identify a sequence-modeling surrogate
methodology which takes as input the initial state and a time series of control
inputs, and outputs an approximation of the objective function and trajectories
of constraint functions. Importantly this approach entirely absorbs the
individual state transition dynamics. The sole dependence on the initial state
means we can apply dimensionality reduction to compress the model input while
retaining most of its information. Uncertainty in the surrogate objective will
affect the result optimality. Critically, however, uncertainty in the surrogate
constraint functions will lead to infeasibility, i.e. unsafe actions. When
considering offline reinforcement learning, the most significant modeling error
will be encountered on out-of-distribution data. Therefore, we apply
Wasserstein ambiguity sets to ``robustify'' our surrogate modeling approach
subject to worst-case out-of-sample modeling error based on the distribution of
test data residuals. We demonstrate the efficacy of this combined approach
through a case study of safe optimal fast charging of a high-dimensional
lithium-ion battery model at low temperatures.

and improving web search quality and have been widely used as part of current
state-of-the-art Learning-To-Rank(LTR) models. With a large volume of search
logs available for major search engines, effective models of searcher click
behavior have emerged to evaluate and train LTR models. However, when modeling
the users' click behavior, considering the bias of the behavior is imperative.
In particular, when a search result is not clicked, it is not necessarily
chosen as not relevant by the user, but instead could have been simply missed,
especially for lower-ranked results. These kinds of biases in the click log
data can be incorporated into the click models, propagating the errors to the
resulting LTR ranking models or evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose
the De-biased Reinforcement Learning Click model (DRLC). The DRLC model relaxes
previously made assumptions about the users' examination behavior and resulting
latent states. To implement the DRLC model, convolutional neural networks are
used as the value networks for reinforcement learning, trained to learn a
policy to reduce bias in the click logs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
the DRLC model, we first compare performance with the previous state-of-art
approaches using established click prediction metrics, including log-likelihood

imaging is explored with the same system, and the result is rather satisfactory
with a synthetic point object. Because of the inherent compatibility between
the compression in spectral and axial dimensions, the proposed mechanism has
the potential to be a unified framework for multi-dimensional compressed

  In the natural virus replication process via cell infection, the nonsense
genomes are corrected by the proofreading enzymes of the virus, strongly
penalized by natural selection and condemned to a very short life by the host
cell's mRNA watching mechanisms. However, for the very long spike genome of
1273 codons, a truncated non-functional spike protein may potentially still
occur with a high frequency, even in presence of a low mutation rate per single

operator. While machine learning (ML), especially deep learning can assist in

$$y=x-\int_{x}^{\infty}\left( (u-u_{xx}+1)^{2/3} -1\right) ds.$$ In different
space-time solitonic regions of $\xi=y/t\in (-\infty,-1/8)\cup(1,+\infty) $ and
$\xi \in(-1/8,1)$, we apply $\overline\partial$ steepest descent method to
obtain the different long time asymptotic expansions of the solution $u(y,t)$.
The corresponding residual error order is $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1+\rho})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$ respectively from a $\overline\partial$-equation. Our
result implies that soliton resolution can be characterized with an
$N(\Lambda)$-soliton whose parameters are modulated by a sum of localized
soliton-soliton interactions as one moves through the regions.

$\gamma_{H}$ was obtained by measuring the upper critical fields under high
magnetic fields over 50 T for both $H\parallel ab$ and $H\parallel c$. On the
other hand, the normal state anisotropy $\gamma_{\rho}$ was obtained by
measuring the resistivity with current flowing in the $ab$ plane ($\rho_{ab}$)
and along the $c$ axis ($\rho_c$). To precisely measure $\rho_{ab}$ and
$\rho_c$ in the same part of a specimen avoiding the variation dependent on
pieces or parts, we adopt a new method using a micro-fabricated bridge with an
additional neck part along $c$ axis. The $\gamma_{H}$ decreases from a value
dependent on the amount of excess Fe at $T_{\rm{c}}$ to a common value $\sim$ 1
at 2 K. The different $\gamma_{H}$ at $T_{\rm{c}}$ ($\sim$1.5 for $y$ = 0, and
2.5 for $y$ = 0.14) suggests that the anisotropy of effective mass
$m_c^*/m_{ab}^*$ increases from $\sim$ 2.25 ($y$ = 0) to 6.25 ($y$ = 0.14) with
the excess Fe. The almost isotropic $\gamma_{H}$ at low temperatures is due to
the strong spin paramagnetic effect at $H\parallel ab$. By contrast, the
$\gamma_{\rho}$ shows a much larger value of $\sim$ 17 ($y$ = 0) to $\sim$ 50
($y$ = 0.14) at the temperature just above $T_{\rm{c}}$. Combined the results
of $\gamma_{H}$ and $\gamma_{\rho}$ near $T_{\rm{c}}$, we found out that the
discrepant anisotropies between the SC and normal states originates from a
large anisotropy of scattering time $\tau_{ab}$/$\tau_c$ $\sim$ 7.8. The
$\tau_{ab}$/$\tau_c$ is found to be independent of the excess Fe.

McMillan models. We use alternatively the Sonnet-Virga-Durand (SVD) and
geometric mean approximations (GMA) to characterize molecular biaxiality by a
single parameter. For non-zero smecticity and biaxiality, the model always
predicts a ground state biaxial smectic A phase. For a low degree of smectic
order, the phase diagram is very rich, predicting uniaxial and biaxial nematic
and smectic phases, with in addition a variety of tricritical and tetracritical
points. For higher degrees of smecticity, the region of stability of the
biaxial nematic phase is restricted and eventually disappears, yielding to the
biaxial smectic phase. Phase diagrams from the two alternative approximations
for molecular biaxiality are similar, except inasmuch that SVD allows for a
first order isotropic-nematic biaxial transition, whereas GMA predicts a Landau

decision-making process using an actor-critic structure in the literature of
artificial intelligence. It is motivated by the psychology literature of
learning through reinforcing good or bad decisions. In a model of an
environment, to learn to make decisions, this AI agent needs to interact with
its environment and make explorative actions. Each action in a given state
brings a reward signal to the agent. These interactive experience is saved in
the agent's memory, which is then used to update its subjective belief of the
world. The agent's decision-making strategy is formed and adjusted based on
this evolving subjective belief. This agent does not only take an action that
it knows would bring a high reward, it also explores other possibilities. This
is the process of taking explorative actions, and it ensures that the agent
notices changes in its environment and adapt its subjective belief and
decisions accordingly. Through a model of stochastic optimal growth, I
illustrate that the economic agent under this proposed learning structure is
adaptive to changes in an underlying stochastic process of the economy. AI
agents can differ in their levels of exploration, which leads to different
experience in the same environment. This reflects on to their different
learning behaviours and welfare obtained. The chosen economic structure
possesses the fundamental decision making problems of macroeconomic models,
i.e., how to make consumption-saving decisions in a lifetime, and it can be
generalised to other decision-making processes and economic models.

to provide a decentralized and secure infrastructure for the LoRa system.
However, there are significant challenges in deploying blockchain at LoRa
gateways with limited edge computing abilities. This article proposes a design
and implementation of the blockchain-enabled LoRa system with edge computing by
using the open-source Hyperledger Fabric, which is called as HyperLoRa.
According to different features of LoRa data, a blockchain network with
multiple ledgers is designed, each of which stores a specific kind of LoRa
data. LoRa gateways can participate in the operations of the blockchain and
share the ledger that keep the time-critical network data with small size.
Then, the edge computing abilities of LoRa gateways are utilized to handle the
join procedure and application packages processing. Furthermore, a HyperLoRa
prototype is implemented on embedded hardware, which demonstrates the
feasibility of deploying the blockchain into LoRa gateways with limited
computing and storage resources. Finally, various experiments are conducted to
evaluate the performances of the proposed LoRa system.

collisions during the formation of planetary systems by introducing random
material loss. In this method the mass and water content lost by the sole
outcome from every merger vary randomly within a range dependent on the total
mass and water content of colliding bodies. The application of the random loss
method to the planet formation in the solar system shows a good consistency
with existing SPH results. We also apply this method to the extrasolar
planetary system 55 Cancri which hosts (at least) five planets and study the
formation of terrestrial planets between the outermost two planets. A disk with
500 Mars mass embryos in dynamically cold orbits before the late-stage
accretion phase is assumed. Scenarios with different amounts of planetary
embryos and different loss parameters are adopted in our simulations. The
statistical result from hundreds of simulations shows that an Earth-like planet
with water inventory of roughly 6 Earth ocean could form between 55 Cnc f and
d. It may reside between 1.0 and 2.6 AU but the most likely region extends from
1.5 to 2.1 AU. Thus the probability of this planet being in the potentially
habitable zone (0.59--1.43 AU) is relatively low, only around 10\%. Planets 55
Cnc f and d could also be shaped and gain some water from giant impacts and
consequently the orbits of them may also change accordingly.

For multi-dimensional finite volume (FV) schemes, we need to perform the
characteristic decomposition several times in different normal directions of
the target cell, which is very time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a
rotated characteristic decomposition technique which requires only one-time
decomposition for multi-dimensional reconstructions. The rotated direction
depends only on the gradient of a specific physical quantity which is cheap to
calculate. This technique not only reduces the computational cost remarkably,
but also controls spurious oscillations effectively. We take a third-order

the Euler equations as an example to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed

$\theta_{\textrm{obs}} = 10^{\circ}\pm3^{\circ}$ and the core of the
ultra-relativistic jet to be $\theta_{\textrm{core}} =
4.4^{\circ}\pm0.9^{\circ}$, where the uncertainties are the $68\%$ credible
interval. The inferred properties and host galaxy combined with Hubble, radio,

afterglow of a binary neutron star merger. We find that other previously
suggested hypotheses are unable to explain all properties of CDF-S XT1. At a
redshift of $z=2.23$, this is potentially the most distant observed neutron
star merger to date and the first orphan afterglow of a short gamma-ray burst.
We discuss the implications of a binary neutron star merger at such a high

Generally speaking, it is relatively easy to collect a massive amount of test

  In this paper, we propose a novel test prioritization technique that brings

capabilities, namely TestRank. Different from existing solutions, TestRank
leverages both intrinsic attributes and contextual attributes of test instances
when prioritizing them. To be specific, we first build a similarity graph on
test instances and training samples, and we conduct graph-based semi-supervised
learning to extract contextual features. Then, for a particular test instance,
the contextual features extracted from the graph neural network (GNN) and the
intrinsic features obtained with the DL model itself are combined to predict
its bug-revealing probability. Finally, TestRank prioritizes unlabeled test
instances in descending order of the above probability value. We evaluate the
performance of TestRank on a variety of image classification datasets.
Experimental results show that the debugging efficiency of our method

self-supervised methods for learning representations from images (e.g., MoCo,

of an image should produce similar embeddings. We show that such methods are
vulnerable to backdoor attacks - where an attacker poisons a small part of the
unlabeled data by adding a trigger (image patch chosen by the attacker) to the
images. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the attacker
can manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time.
Backdoor attacks have been studied extensively in supervised learning and to
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study them for self-supervised
learning. Backdoor attacks are more practical in self-supervised learning,
since the use of large unlabeled data makes data inspection to remove poisons
prohibitive. We show that in our targeted attack, the attacker can produce many

estimation (MHE) which uses most recent measurements of a limited length to
perform the estimation. Due to the theoretical ideal, conditions for robust
stability of FIE are relatively easier to establish than those for MHE, and
various sufficient conditions have been developed in literature. This work
reveals a generic link from robust stability of FIE to that of MHE, showing
that the former implies at least a weaker robust stability of MHE which
implements a long enough horizon. The implication strengthens to strict robust
stability of MHE if the corresponding FIE satisfies a mild Lipschitz continuity
condition. The revealed implications are then applied to derive new sufficient
conditions for robust stability of MHE, which further reveal an intrinsic
relation between the existence of a robustly stable FIE/MHE and the system
being incrementally input/output-to-state stable.

negation without any aid of sequences (multiple panels) or conventional devices

Parameters in the KIDS functional are adjusted to nuclear matter equation of
state, energy and radius of selected nuclei, and effective mass of nucleons.
Hartree-Fock equation is solved to obtain the wave functions of the nucleon in
target nuclei, and they are plugged in the calculation of electron-nucleus
scattering cross sections at the energies of incident electrons 300 MeV ~ 2.5
GeV. Theoretical prediction agrees well with measurement. Dependence on the
effective mass is evident: cross section tends to increase with small isoscalar
effective masses. However, effect of isovector effective mass is negligible.
Spectroscopic factors are estimated for the protons in the outermost shells of
$^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb. Results are consistent with the values in

perform a momentum-independent spin measurement, showing the inadequacy of the
spin reduced density matrix as a legitimate information resource. This is
because there is an unavoidable ambiguity in the definition of the spin of a
moving particle. In this paper, by introducing a vector bundle theoretic way to
view the single-particle state space, we try to rule out this ambiguity. The
discrete degree of freedom of the resulting representation space contains
information about the Pauli-Lubansky four-vector of the particle instead of the
ambiguous spin. Comparing this representation with the standard one used in the
RQI literature, we show that the discrete degree of freedom of the standard
representation space attains the meaning of the Newton-Wigner spin. Also using
this viewpoint, we give a mathematical proof of why the spin reduced density
matrix is meaningless, which is stronger than the previous claims in that it
asserts that the matrix is void of any meaning at all, not just in terms of the
impossibility of measurement or Lorentz non-covariance. We give a way (which
turns out to be the only way) to modify it to obtain the Pauli-Lubansky reduced
density matrix, which is covariant under Lorentz transformations.

the state-action value (Q-function) by minimizing the mean squared Bellman
error leads to a regression problem with confounding, the inputs and output
noise being correlated. Hence, direct minimization of the Bellman error can
result in significantly biased Q-function estimates. We explain why fixing the
target Q-network in Deep Q-Networks and Fitted Q Evaluation provides a way of
overcoming this confounding, thus shedding new light on this popular but not
well understood trick in the deep RL literature. An alternative approach to
address confounding is to leverage techniques developed in the causality
literature, notably instrumental variables (IV). We bring together here the
literature on IV and RL by investigating whether IV approaches can lead to
improved Q-function estimates. This paper analyzes and compares a wide range of
recent IV methods in the context of offline policy evaluation (OPE), where the
goal is to estimate the value of a policy using logged data only. By applying
different IV techniques to OPE, we are not only able to recover previously
proposed OPE methods such as model-based techniques but also to obtain
competitive new techniques. We find empirically that state-of-the-art OPE
methods are closely matched in performance by some IV methods such as AGMM,
which were not developed for OPE. We open-source all our code and datasets at

nature and human society, such as gonorrhea propagation and meme spreading.
Identifying influential spreaders is an important issue in the reversible
spreading dynamics on complex networks, which has been given much attention.
Except for structural centrality, the nodes' dynamical states play a
significant role in their spreading influence in the reversible spreading
processes. By integrating the number of outgoing edges and infection risks of
node's neighbors into structural centrality, a new measure for identifying
influential spreaders is articulated which considers the relative importance of
structure and dynamics on node influence. The number of outgoing edges and
infection risks of neighbors represent the positive effect of the local
structural characteristic and the negative effect of the dynamical states of
nodes in identifying influential spreaders, respectively. We find that an
appropriate combination of these two characteristics can greatly improve the
accuracy of the proposed measure in identifying the most influential spreaders.
Notably, compared with the positive effect of the local structural
characteristic, slightly weakening the negative effect of dynamical states of
nodes can make the proposed measure play the best performance. Quantitatively
understanding the relative importance of structure and dynamics on node
influence provides a significant insight into identifying influential nodes in
the reversible spreading processes.

cancers in clinical practice. The complementary effect of multi-view mammogram
images provides valuable information about the breast anatomical prior
structure and is of great significance in digital mammography interpretation.
However, unlike radiologists who can utilize the natural reasoning ability to
identify masses based on multiple mammographic views, how to endow the existing
object detection models with the capability of multi-view reasoning is vital
for decision-making in clinical diagnosis but remains the boundary to explore.
In this paper, we propose an Anatomy-aware Graph convolutional Network (AGN),
which is tailored for mammogram mass detection and endows existing detection
methods with multi-view reasoning ability. The proposed AGN consists of three
steps. Firstly, we introduce a Bipartite Graph convolutional Network (BGN) to
model the intrinsic geometric and semantic relations of ipsilateral views.
Secondly, considering that the visual asymmetry of bilateral views is widely
adopted in clinical practice to assist the diagnosis of breast lesions, we
propose an Inception Graph convolutional Network (IGN) to model the structural
similarities of bilateral views. Finally, based on the constructed graphs, the
multi-view information is propagated through nodes methodically, which equips
the features learned from the examined view with multi-view reasoning ability.
Experiments on two standard benchmarks reveal that AGN significantly exceeds
the state-of-the-art performance. Visualization results show that AGN provides
interpretable visual cues for clinical diagnosis.

highest redshift ($z=3.1$) quasar pair with a separation $<$ 10 kpc. Based on
the sample acquired to date, the success rate of identifying physically
associated dual quasars is $19\%$ when excluding stars based on their HSC
colors. Using the full sample of six spectroscopically confirmed dual quasars,
we find that the black holes in these systems have black hole masses ($M_{BH}
\sim 10^{8-9}M_{\odot}$) similar to single SDSS quasars as well as their
bolometric luminosities and Eddington ratios. We measure the stellar mass of
their host galaxies based on 2D image decomposition of the five-band ($grizy$)
optical emission and assess the mass relation between supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) and their hosts. Dual SMBHs appear to have elevated masses relative to

the tip of the osteotome arrives in frontal bone, which corresponds to the end
of the osteotomy pathway. Seven New Zealand White rabbit heads were collected,
and two osteotomies were performed on their left and right nasal bones using
the instrumented hammer to record the variation of the force as a function of

osteotome through the measurement of $\tau$. The values of $\tau$ measured in
the frontal bone were significantly lower than in the nasal bone (p < 10-10),

results should be validated clinically, this technology could be used by

approach to describe rhythmic patterns in oscillatory signals. The frequency
modulated M\""obius (FMM) model is defined as a parametric signal plus a
gaussian noise, where the signal can be described as a single or a sum of
waves. The FMM approach is flexible enough to describe a great variety of
rhythmic patterns. The FMM package includes all required functions to fit and
explore single and multi-wave FMM models, as well as a restricted version that
allows equality constraints between parameters representing a priori knowledge
about the shape to be included. Moreover, the FMM package can generate
synthetic data and visualize the results of the fitting process. The potential
of this methodology is illustrated with examples of such biological
oscillations as the circadian rhythm in gene expression, the electrical
activity of the heartbeat and neuronal activity.

the total population size for a standard logistic-diffusive model. This
optimisation problem stems from the study of spatial ecology and amounts to the
following question: assuming a species evolves in a domain, what is the best
way to spread resources in order to ensure a maximal population size at
equilibrium? {In recent years, many authors contributed to this topic.} We
settle here the proof of two fundamental properties of optimisers: the
bang-bang one which had so far only been proved under several strong
assumptions, and the other one is the fragmentation of maximisers. Here, we
prove the bang-bang property in all generality using a new spectral method. The
technique introduced to demonstrate the bang-bang character of optimizers can
be adapted and generalized to many optimization problems with other classes of
bilinear optimal control problems where the state equation is semilinear and
elliptic. We comment on it in a conclusion section.Regarding the geometry of
maximisers, we exhibit a blow-up rate for the $BV$-norm of maximisers as the
diffusivity gets smaller: if $\O$ is an orthotope and if $m_\mu$ is an optimal
control, then $\Vert m_\mu\Vert_{BV}\gtrsim \sqrt{\mu}$. The proof of this
results relies on a very fine energy argument.

models to infer the importance of disc fading in the transition of spirals into
lenticular (S0) galaxies. The local S0 population has both higher photometric
concentration and lower stellar spin than spiral galaxies of comparable mass
and we test whether this separation can be accounted for by passive aging
alone. We construct a suite of dynamically self--consistent galaxy models, with
a bulge, disc and halo using the GalactICS code. The dispersion-dominated bulge
is given a uniformly old stellar population, while the disc is given a current
star formation rate putting it on the main sequence, followed by sudden
instantaneous quenching. We then generate mock observables (r-band images,
stellar velocity and dispersion maps) as a function of time since quenching for
a range of bulge/total (B/T) mass ratios. The disc fading leads to a decline in
measured spin as the bulge contribution becomes more dominant, and also leads
to increased concentration. However, the quantitative changes observed after 5
Gyr of disc fading cannot account for all of the observed difference. We see
similar results if we instead subdivide our SAMI Galaxy Survey sample by star
formation (relative to the main sequence). We use EAGLE simulations to also
take into account progenitor bias, using size evolution to infer quenching
time. The EAGLE simulations suggest that the progenitors of current passive
galaxies typically have slightly higher spin than present day star-forming disc
galaxies of the same mass. As a result, progenitor bias moves the data further
from the disc fading model scenario, implying that intrinsic dynamical
evolution must be important in the transition from star-forming discs to
passive discs.

via price adjustment can be viewed as a Walrasian tatonnement process.
Specifically, prosumers and consumers compete to adjust their energy exchange
with other agents to maximize their profit gained by renewable emission
reduction benefits while minimizing the associated cost of energy. To this end,
we have adopted a peer-to-peer energy trading mechanism based on continuous
double auction that can be viewed as a multi-parametric quadratic problem.

researchers and have since been successfully employed for several problems
traditionally addressed with convolutional neural networks. At the same time,
image synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has drastically
improved over the last few years. The recently proposed TransGAN is the first
GAN using only transformer-based architectures and achieves competitive results
when compared to convolutional GANs. However, since transformers are
data-hungry architectures, TransGAN requires data augmentation, an auxiliary
super-resolution task during training, and a masking prior to guide the
self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we study the combination of a
transformer-based generator and convolutional discriminator and successfully
remove the need of the aforementioned required design choices. We evaluate our
approach by conducting a benchmark of well-known CNN discriminators, ablate the
size of the transformer-based generator, and show that combining both
architectural elements into a hybrid model leads to better results.
Furthermore, we investigate the frequency spectrum properties of generated
images and observe that our model retains the benefits of an attention based
generator.

  Convolutional Neural Networks","Submitted in IEEE",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using stochastic gradient
descent (SGD)-based optimizers. Recently, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam)
optimizer has become very popular due to its adaptive momentum, which tackles
the dying gradient problem of SGD. Nevertheless, existing optimizers are still
unable to exploit the optimization curvature information efficiently. This
paper proposes a new AngularGrad optimizer that considers the behavior of the
direction/angle of consecutive gradients. This is the first attempt in the
literature to exploit the gradient angular information apart from its
magnitude. The proposed AngularGrad generates a score to control the step size
based on the gradient angular information of previous iterations. Thus, the
optimization steps become smoother as a more accurate step size of immediate
past gradients is captured through the angular information. Two variants of
AngularGrad are developed based on the use of Tangent or Cosine functions for
computing the gradient angular information. Theoretically, AngularGrad exhibits
the same regret bound as Adam for convergence purposes. Nevertheless, extensive
experiments conducted on benchmark data sets against state-of-the-art methods
reveal a superior performance of AngularGrad. The source code will be made

elements for creating quantum networks as not only constituting the nodes of

study deterministic preparation of arbitrary size $W$ states with spin systems.
We present an efficient operation on three qubits, two being the logical qubits
and one being the ancillary qubit, where no interaction between the logical
qubits are required. The proposed operation can create a $W$-type
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair from two separable qubits, and expand that
EPR pair or an arbitrary size $W$ state by one, creating a $W$-like state.
Taking this operation as the fundamental building block, we show how to create
a large scale $W$ state out of separable qubits, or double the size of a $W$
state. Based on this operation and focusing on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in
diamond as an exemplary spin system, we propose a setup for preparing $W$
states of circularly polarized photons, assisted by a single spin qubit, where
no photon-photon interactions are required. Next, we propose a setup for
preparing $W$ states of spin qubits of spatially separated systems, assisted by
a single photon. We also analyze the effects of possible imperfections in
implementing the gates on the fidelity of the generated $W$ states. In our
setups, neither post-measurement, nor post-processing on the states of spin or
photonic qubit is required. Our setups can be implemented with current

extracted from the hyperspectral imagery, called endmember-guided unmixing

two-stream Siamese deep network, which learns an additional network from the
pure or nearly-pure endmembers to correct the weights of another unmixing
network by sharing network parameters and adding spectrally meaningful
constraints (e.g., non-negativity and sum-to-one) towards a more accurate and
interpretable unmixing solution. Furthermore, the resulting general framework
is not only limited to pixel-wise spectral unmixing but also applicable to
spatial information modeling with convolutional operators for spatial-spectral
unmixing. Experimental results conducted on three different datasets with the

currents in superconductors is to incorporate dispersed, non-superconducting

interlaying superconducting matrix, which can detrimentally reduce $T_c$.
Consequently, an optimal balance must be achieved between the nanoparticle
density $n_p$ and size $d$. Determining this balance requires garnering a
better understanding of vortex-nanoparticle interactions, described by strong
pinning theory. Here, we map the dependence of the critical current on
nanoparticle size and density in
(Y$_{0.77}$,Gd$_{0.23}$)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films in magnetic fields up
to 35 T, and compare the trends to recent results from time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau simulations. We identify consistencies between the
field-dependent critical current $J_c(B)$ and expectations from strong pinning
theory. Specifically, we find that that $J_c \propto B^{-\alpha}$, where
$\alpha$ decreases from $0.66$ to $0.2$ with increasing density of
nanoparticles and increases roughly linearly with nanoparticle size $d/\xi$
(normalized to the coherence length). At high fields, the critical current
decays faster ($\sim B^{-1}$), suggestive that each nanoparticle has captured a
vortex. When nanoparticles capture more than one vortex, a small, high-field
peak is expected in $J_c(B)$. Due to a spread in defect sizes, this novel peak
effect remains unresolved here. Lastly, we reveal that the dependence of the
vortex creep rate $S$ on nanoparticle size and density roughly mirrors that of
$\alpha$, and compare our results to low-$T$ nonlinearities in $S(T)$ that are
predicted by strong pinning theory.

customers during on-peak hours in lieu of financial gains to reduce stress on
distribution systems. Existing dynamic price models have not provided adequate
success to price-based demand response (PBDR) programs. It happened as these
models have raised typical socio-economic problems pertaining to cross-subsidy,
free-riders, social inequity, assured profit of utilities, financial gains and
comfort of customers, etc. This paper presents a new dynamic price model for
PBDR in distribution systems which aims to overcome some of the above mentioned
problems of the existing price models. The main aim of the developed price
model is to overcome the problems of cross-subsidy and free-riders of the
existing price models for widespread acceptance, deployment and efficient
utilization of PBDR programs in contemporary distribution systems. Proposed
price model generates demand-linked price signal that imposes different price
signals to different customers during on-peak hours and remains static
otherwise. This makes proposed model a class apart from other existing models.
The novelty of the proposed model lies in the fact that the financial benefits
and penalties pertaining to DR are self-adjusted among customers while
preserving social equity and profit of the utility. Such an ideology has not
been yet addressed in the literature. Detailed investigation of application
results on a standard test bench reveals that the proposed model equally cares
regarding the interests of both customers and utility. For economic assessment,
a comparison of the proposed price model with the existing pricing models is
also performed.

the field window of the SkX appearance to lower values. The Metropolis dynamics

migrating cell that is repelled from the diffusive chemotactic signal that it
secrets on its way, denoted as auto-chemotactic searcher. To analyze the
efficiency of this class of non-Markovian search processes we present a general
formalism that allows to compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a given

probabilities decreases the MFPT systematically and substantially with an
increasing number of steps. It turns out that the optimal search strategies can
be reduced to simple cycles defined by a small parameter set and that
mirror-asymmetric walks are more efficient. For the auto-chemotactic searcher
we show that an optimal coupling between the searcher and the chemical reduces
the MFPT to 1/3 of the one for a Markovian random walk.

asymptotically best possible (although the minimum $d$-degree condition forcing
a perfect matching in a $k$-graph is in general unknown). For (1) we also
discuss two directed versions and a multipartite version. Finally, to establish

SCCs are used in solving the 2-satisfiability problem, which has applications

atmosphere of highly irradiated gas giant planets. Recent observations have
identified these inversion layers. However, the role of different chemical
species in their formation remains unclear. We search for the signature of the
thermal inversion agents TiO and Fe in the dayside emission spectrum of the
ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33b. The spectra were obtained with CARMENES and
HARPS-N, covering different wavelength ranges. Telluric and stellar absorption
lines were removed with SYSREM. We cross-correlated the residual spectra with
model spectra to retrieve the signals from the planetary atmosphere. We find
evidence for TiO at a significance of 4.9$\mathrm{\sigma}$ with CARMENES. The
strength of the TiO signal drops close to the secondary eclipse. No TiO signal
is found with HARPS-N. An injection-recovery test suggests that the TiO signal
is below the detection level at the wavelengths covered by HARPS-N. The
emission signature of Fe is detected with both instruments at significance
levels of 5.7$\mathrm{\sigma}$ and 4.5$\mathrm{\sigma}$, respectively. By
combining all observations, we obtain a significance level of
7.3$\mathrm{\sigma}$ for Fe. We find the TiO signal at $K_\mathrm{p}$ =
$248.0_{-2.5}^{+2.0}$ km s$^{-1}$, which is in disagreement with the Fe
detection at $K_\mathrm{p}$ = $225.0_{-3.5}^{+4.0}$ km s$^{-1}$. The
$K_\mathrm{p}$ value for Fe is in agreement with prior investigations. The
model spectra require different temperature profiles for TiO and Fe to match
the observations. We observe a broader line profile for Fe than for TiO. Our
results confirm the existence of a temperature inversion layer in the planetary
atmosphere. The observed $K_\mathrm{p}$ offset and different strengths of
broadening in the line profiles suggest the existence of a TiO-depleted hot

a complex manifold of bright and dark exciton states. While dark excitons are
known to dominate the relaxation dynamics and low-temperature

remained elusive. In our joint theory-experiment study, we address this
intriguing regime of dark state transport by resolving the spatio-temporal
exciton dynamics in hBN-encapsulated WSe$_2$ monolayers after resonant
excitation. We find clear evidence of an unconventional, time-dependent
diffusion during the first tens of picoseconds, exhibiting strong deviation
from the steady-state propagation. Dark exciton states are initially populated
by phonon emission from the bright states, resulting in creation of hot
excitons whose rapid expansion leads to a transient increase of the diffusion
coefficient by more than one order of magnitude. These findings are relevant
for both fundamental understanding of the spatio-temporal exciton dynamics in
atomically thin materials as well as their technological application by
enabling rapid diffusion.

of unconventional antibiotics classes that are drawing increasing research
attention. In response, we developed an antimicrobial activity prediction model

lacks extensive prior structure-activity relationship studies. Our approach
enables us to predict minimum inhibitory concentration for E. coli K12, with 21
molecular descriptors selected by recursive elimination from a set of 5,305
descriptors. This predictive model achieves an R2 of 0.65 with no prior
knowledge of the underlying mechanism. We find the molecular representation
optimum for the domain is the key to good predictions of antimicrobial
activity. In the case of conjugated oligoelectrolytes, a representation
reflecting the 3-dimensional shape of the molecules is most critical. Although
it is demonstrated with a specific example of conjugated oligoelectrolytes, our
proposed approach for creating the predictive model can be readily adapted to
other novel antibiotic candidate domains.

found in patients with multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity
in trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is
frequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in
busy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide
substantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending
trauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform
grading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to
enable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering
insights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an
automated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist
radiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method
operates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects
distinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model
that are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical
best practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and
finally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures
that may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating
point of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and
corresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides
finding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on
important counterfactuals that would invalidate the system's recommendation and
achieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.
Despite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not
compromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.

safety for all future time steps. The theoretical guarantees of such predictive
safety filters rely on the model assumptions and minor deviations can lead to
failure of the filter putting the system at risk. This paper introduces an
auxiliary soft-constrained predictive control problem that is always feasible
at each time step and asymptotically stabilizes the feasible set of the
original safety filter, thereby providing a recovery mechanism in
safety-critical situations. This is achieved by a simple constraint tightening
in combination with a terminal control barrier function. By extending
discrete-time control barrier function theory, we establish that the proposed
auxiliary problem provides a `predictive' control barrier function. The
resulting algorithm is demonstrated using numerical examples.

laser lithography is a promising approach, which is not extensively applied
yet, as fabrication speed, surface quality, and stability of the resulting

We introduce a theoretical model which captures diffusion of particles and heat
as well as the fluid dynamics of the photo-resist. Chemical reactions are
excluded from the model but particle production is calibrated using
experimental data. We find that optical forces generally surmount those due to
convection of the photo-resist. Simulations predict overheating of the
photo-resist at laser powers similar to those found in experiments. The thermal
sensitivity of the system is essentially determined by the largest particles
present in the laser focus. Our results suggest that to improve particle
deposition and to achieve higher writing speeds in metal direct laser writing,
strong optical trapping of the emerging particles is desirable. Furthermore,
precise control of the particle size reduces the risk of spontaneous

research while crawling these data from Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs). Further, the data that comprises of over 86 million tweets have been
analysed from various perspective including the most used languages, most
frequent words, most frequent users, countries with most and least tweets and
re-tweets, etc. The analysis reveals that the users' data associated with
Twitter has a high affinity for researches in the various domain that includes
politics, social science, economics, and linguistics, etc. In addition, the
relation between Twitter users of a country and its human development index has
been identified. It is observed that countries with very high human development
indices have a relatively higher number of tweets compared to low human
development indices countries. It is envisaged that the present study shall
open many doors of researches in information processing and data science.

by the introduction of dispersion-encoding. The extension facilitates the
measurement of surface height profiles with sub-nm resolution. The selection of
a dispersive element for encoding allows for tuning of the axial measurement
range and resolution of the setup. The approach is theoretically designed and
implemented for applications such as surface profilometry, the characterization
of polymeric cross-linking and as a tool for the determination of layer
thicknesses in thin-film processing. During the characterization of the
implemented setup, it was shown that an axial measurement range of 79.91 $\mu
m$ with a resolution of 0.1 nm was achievable in the evaluation of surface
profiles. Simultaneously, profiles of up to 1.5 mm length could be obtained
without the need for mechanical scanning. This marked a significant improvement
in relation to state-of-the-art technologies in terms of dynamic range. It was
also shown that axial and lateral measurement range can be decoupled partially.
Additionally, functional parameters such as surface roughness were
characterized with the same tool. The characterization of the degree of
polymeric cross-linking was performed as a function of the refractive index.
Here, the refractive index could be acquired in a spatially-resolved manner
with an index resolution of down to $3.36 \pm 10^{-5}$. This was achieved by
the development of a novel mathematical analysis approach. For the acquisition
of layer thicknesses of thin-films, an advanced setup was developed which could
be used to characterize the thickness thin-films and its (flexible) substrate
simultaneously.

based on two silver mirrors coated on a thin single crystal diamond membrane,
forming a planar Fabry-P\'erot cavity that improves the photon extraction from
single tin vacancy (SnV) centers as well as their coupling to an excitation
laser. Upon numerical optimization of the structure, we find theoretical
enhancements in the collectible photon rate by a factor of 60 as compared to
the bulk case. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we fabricate single
crystal diamond membranes with sub-$\mu$m thickness and create SnV centers by
ion implantation. Employing off-resonant excitation, we show a 6-fold
enhancement of the collectible photon rate, yielding up to half a million
photons per second from a single SnV center. At the same time, we observe a
significant reduction of the required excitation power in accordance with
theory, demonstrating the functionality of the cavity as an optical antenna.
Due to its planar design, the antenna simultaneously provides similar
enhancements for a large number of emitters inside the membrane. Furthermore,
the monolithic structure provides high mechanical stability and

smooth and accurate motion with considering the constraints of kinematics
constraints such as angular position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk. The
problem of using the combination of n-order polynomials is that there is no
ideally match between the segments of trajectory path at the via point in terms
of the number of kinematic constraints. It leads to generate undesirable
trajectory path at the via point that connects between two segments of the
trajectory path. In this paper, we aim to investigate the effect of increasing
to higher order polynomial blends on the accuracy of the via points with
considering different kinematics constraints. Based on that, the methodology
that was used in this paper is based on the polynomial segment with the higher
polynomial blend (PSPB). Three techniques implemented which are 4-3-4 PSPB,
5-4-5 PSPB, and 6-5-6 PSPB. Each technique implemented based on applying
different kinematic constraints. The three techniques validated using a
modeling design in SemiMechanics. According to the methodology, the result
analyzed and discussed in terms of angular position, angular velocity, angular
acceleration, and angular jerk based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and
Average Difference Error (ADE). The result shows that RMSE of angular position
for 4-3-4 PSPB-1, 4-3-4 PSPB-2, 5-4-5 PSPB-1, 5-4-5 PSPB-2, 6-5-6 PSPB-1, and

0.0612, and 0.0311 degrees respectively. Thus, the error is increased obviously
when there is no ideal match at the via point in terms of a number of kinematic
constraints.

three degrees of freedom. We analytically construct a symmetric critical point
for all admissible values of $L_2$, which is necessarily globally stable for
small domains i.e., when the square edge length, $\lambda$, is small enough. We
perform asymptotic analyses and numerical studies to discover at least $5$
classes of these symmetric critical points - the $WORS$, $Ring^{\pm}$,
$Constant$ and $pWORS$ solutions, of which the $WORS$, $Ring^+$ and $Constant$

solution is energetically preferable for large $\lambda$ and large $L_2$, and
prove associated stability results that corroborate the stabilising effects of
$L_2$ for reduced Landau-de Gennes critical points. We complement our analysis

Vanadium films of similar thickness, we obtain a reduction in oxidation
duration by more than one order. Synthesized VO2 thin film shows resistance
switching of ~3 orders of magnitude. We demonstrate optical reflectance
switching in long-wave infrared wavelengths in VO2 films synthesized using
atmospheric oxidation of Vanadium. The extracted refractive index of VO2 in the
insulating and in the metallic phase is in good agreement with VO2 synthesized
using other methods. The considerable reduction in oxidation time of VO2
synthesis while retaining good resistance and optical switching properties will
help in integration of VO2 in limited thermal budget processes, enabling
further applications of this phase-transition material.

autonomous driving. However, previous approaches provide only black-box
solutions, which do not offer information on how confident the agent is about
its decisions. An estimate of both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of
the agent's decisions is fundamental for real-world applications of autonomous
driving. Therefore, this paper introduces the Ensemble Quantile Networks (EQN)
method, which combines distributional RL with an ensemble approach, to obtain a
complete uncertainty estimate. The distribution over returns is estimated by
learning its quantile function implicitly, which gives the aleatoric
uncertainty, whereas an ensemble of agents is trained on bootstrapped data to
provide a Bayesian estimation of the epistemic uncertainty. A criterion for
classifying which decisions that have an unacceptable uncertainty is also
introduced. The results show that the EQN method can balance risk and time
efficiency in different occluded intersection scenarios, by considering the
estimated aleatoric uncertainty. Furthermore, it is shown that the trained
agent can use the epistemic uncertainty information to identify situations that
the agent has not been trained for and thereby avoid making unfounded,
potentially dangerous, decisions outside of the training distribution.

Therefore, in the current work, nanomaterials having drug releasing and
antibacterial properties is coated onto the cotton gauze bandage to minimize
the local pain and post-dressing infections at a wound site. We fabricated
diclofenac sodium (an anti-inflammatory drug) loaded biodegradable,
polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers mat through electrospinning and deposited it
over the surface of a CGB that was initially coated by chitosan and decorated
with ZnO nanoparticles. Chitosan coating over the CGB provides the
antibacterial properties while the drug loaded nanofibers mat releases
diclofenac sodium under a simulated drug release condition. In addition, the
decorated ZnO nanoparticles have ultra violet radiation blocking properties.
The modified bandage was characterised by SEM, EDAX, DSC, UV spectroscopy, and
FTIR. The antibacterial property of the bandage was evaluated through zone of
inhibition test during the anti-bacterial study. Thereafter, drug release and
degradation studies revealed the modified bandage could provide sustained drug
release for 15 days, perhaps through surface erosion and later bulk degradation
mechanism. Thus, the nanomaterials decorated CGB can be a better alternative to

quantitative study of photochemical reactions, but their accurate computation
on classical computers is plagued by prohibitive scaling. The Variational
Quantum Deflation (VQD) is an extension of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
(VQE) for calculating electronic excited state energies, and has the potential
to address some of these scaling challenges using quantum computers. However,
quantum computers available in the near term can only support a limited number
of circuit operations, so reducing the quantum computational cost in VQD
methods is critical to their realisation. In this work, we investigate the use
of adaptive quantum circuit growth (ADAPT-VQE) in excited state VQD
calculations, a strategy that has been successful previously in reducing the
resource for ground state energy VQE calculations. We also invoke spin
restrictions to separate the recovery of eigenstates with different spin
symmetry to reduce the number of calculations and accumulation of errors. We
created a quantum eigensolver emulation package - Quantum Eigensolver Building
on Achievements of Both quantum computing and quantum chemistry (QEBAB) - for
testing the proposed adaptive procedure against two VQD methods that use
fixed-length quantum circuits. For a lithium hydride test case we found that
the spin-restricted adaptive growth variant of VQD uses the most compact
circuits by far, consistently recovers adequate electron correlation energy for
different nuclear geometries and eigenstates while isolating the singlet and
triplet manifold. This work is a further step towards developing techniques
which improve the efficiency of hybrid quantum algorithms for excited state

transition between the photosphere where the gas motion is determined by the
gas pressure and the corona dominated by the magnetic field. We study the
effect of partial ionization for 2D wave propagation in a gravitationally
stratified, magnetized atmosphere with properties similar to the solar
chromosphere. We adopt an oblique uniform magnetic field in the plane of
propagation with strength suitable for a quiet sun region. The theoretical
model used is a single fluid magnetohydrodynamic approximation, where
ion-neutral interaction is modeled by the ambipolar diffusion term. Magnetic
energy can be converted into internal energy through the dissipation of the
electric current produced by the drift between ions and neutrals. We use
numerical simulations where we continuously drive fast waves at the bottom of
the atmosphere. The collisional coupling between ions and neutrals decreases
with the decrease of the density and the ambipolar effect becomes important.
Fast waves excited at the base of the atmosphere reach the equipartition layer
and reflect or transmit as slow waves. While the waves propagate through the
atmosphere and the density drops, the waves steepen into shocks. The main
effect of ambipolar diffusion is damping of the waves. We find that for the
parameters chosen in this work, the ambipolar diffusion affects the fast wave
before it is reflected, with damping being more pronounced for waves which are
launched in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. Slow waves are
less affected by ambipolar effects. The damping increases for shorter periods
and larger magnetic field strengths. Small scales produced by the nonlinear
effects and the superposition of different types of waves created at the
equipartition height are efficiently damped by ambipolar diffusion.

bi-stability. Interestingly, the obtained pressure distribution shows that the
maximal pressure on the chamber's surface is greater than the pressure at the
entrance to the chamber. The calculated series solution of the velocity and

two-dimensional lipid membrane immersed in a simple fluid between two parallel
flat and porous walls under shear. The nonlinear dynamics of the membrane gives
rise to a rich dynamical behavior depending on the shear velocity. In quiescent
conditions (i.e., absence of shear), the membrane freezes into a disordered
labyrinthine wrinkle pattern. In the presence of shear, we find four different
regimes depending on the shear rate. Regime I. For small shear, the
labyrinthine pattern is still frozen, but exhibits a small drift which is
mainly along the shear direction. In this regime, the tangential forces on the
walls due to the presence of the membrane increase linearly with the shear
rate. Regime II. When the shear rate is increased above a critical value, the
membrane rearranges, and wrinkles start to align along the shear direction.
This regime is accompanied by a sharp drop of the tangential forces on the
wall. Regime III. For larger shear rates, the wrinkles align strongly along the
shear direction, with a set of dislocation defects which assemble in pairs. The
tangential forces are then controlled by the number of dislocations, and by the
number of wrinkles between the two dislocations within each dislocation pairs.
In this dislocation-dominated regime, the tangential forces in the transverse
direction most often exceed those in the shear direction. Regime IV. For even
larger shear, the membrane organizes into a perfect array of parallel stripes
with no defects. The wavelength of the wrinkles is still identical to the
wavelength in the absence of shear. In this final regime, the tangential forces
due to the membrane vanish. These behaviors give rise to a non-linear
rheological behavior of lubricated contacts containing membranes.

The method relies on making an ansatz on the cloud shape along the unresolved

This paper addresses the optimization of the feature spaces as well as the

\mu^-)/\mathcal{B}(B^+ \rightarrow K^+ e^+ e^-)$. This observable is measured
using proton-proton collision data recorded with the LHCb detector at CERN's
Large Hadron Collider corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9
\rm{~fb}^{-1}$. For a dilepton invariant mass range of $q^{2} \in
[1.1,6.0]~\rm{Ge}\kern -0.1em \rm{V}^{2}$, the measured value of
$R_{K}=0.846\,^{+\,0.042}_{-\,0.039}\,^{+\,0.013}_{-\,0.012}$, where the first
uncertainty is statistic and the second systematic, is in tension with the
Standard Model predicted value at the $3.1\sigma$ level raising evidence for
lepton flavour universality violation in $B^+ \rightarrow K^+ \ell^+ \ell^-$
decays.

used in this work to explore the influences of capillary number (Ca) and flow
rate ratio (Qr) of dispersed and continuous phases on hydrodynamics of droplet
generation in two-phase flow through T-junction cross-flow microfluidic device.
A mathematical model based on a mass continuity, Navier-Stokes, and level set
equations are solved computationally using the Eulerian framework for Ca = 1e-4
- 1 and Qr =0.1 - 10. Both immiscible phases, having equal density and unequal
viscosity, flow (Re=0.1) through equal-sized channels. In particular,
instantaneous phase flow field, droplet size, droplet detachment time and
generation frequency are presented and discussed as a function of governing
parameters (Ca and Qr). Considered parametric space is characterized as
squeezing, first transition, dripping, second transition, parallel, and jet
flow regimes. In contrast to threshold Ca ~ 0.01 in earlier studies, squeezing
regime exists for all Ca and Qr = 2- 10. Flow regimes are also mapped into
droplets and non-droplet zones. Threshold interfacial Ca, defining the boundary
between droplet and non-droplet zones, scales quadratically with Qr. Droplet
dynamics shows a complex dependence on Ca and Qr. Droplet length varies
linearly with Qr in squeezing regime whereas power-law variation with Ca and Qr
in dripping regime. Droplet frequency shows a power-law function of Ca and Qr
in droplet zone. Present results compare excellently with earlier limited
experimental and numerical studies. Finally, present results and predictive
correlations can guide engineering and design of droplet microfluidics devices.

recent Deep Learning-based solutions achieve satisfactory performance, their
high computational cost renders their application in real-life settings in
which computations need to be performed on embedded platforms intractable. In
this paper, we analyze the efficiency of two popular voxel-based 3D object
detection methods providing a good compromise between high performance and
speed based on two aspects, their ability to detect objects located at large
distances from the agent and their ability to operate in real time on embedded
platforms equipped with high-performance GPUs. Our experiments show that these
methods mostly fail to detect distant small objects due to the sparsity of the
input point clouds at large distances. Moreover, models trained on near objects
achieve similar or better performance compared to those trained on all objects
in the scene. This means that the models learn object appearance
representations mostly from near objects. Our findings suggest that a
considerable part of the computations of existing methods is focused on
locations of the scene that do not contribute with successful detection. This
means that the methods can achieve a speed-up of $40$-$60\%$ by restricting
operation to near objects while not sacrificing much in performance.

(ii) the linear transformation of base-features is generalised to a
feature-map, a function of the base-features parametrised by the meta-genotype;
and (iii) the mutation rate of the QD algorithm and the number of generations

nanodosimeter device has been carried out in order to investigate to what
extent measured ionisation cluster size distributions can serve as benchmark
data for modelling approaches, with particular focus on the target size in
terms of liquid H2O. To this end, measurements with alpha particles from a
241Am source were carried out using three different target gases, H2O, C3H8 and
C4H8O. For each of the three target gases, three different drift-time windows
were applied to realise three different target sizes. A method has been
developed to determine the dimensions of the simulated nanometric target volume
in liquid H2O for cylindrical and spherical shape, as often used in approaches
to model radiation effects to DNA. Simulations with nanometric targets of
dimensions determined with this method agree very well with the corresponding
measurements. Scaling of the spatial distribution of the extraction efficiency
for different target gases and drift-time windows, which corresponds to the
nanodosimeter's target volume, in terms of liquid H2O using
($\rho\lambda_{ion}$)-ratios has also been investigated and proved to yield an
estimate of the target volume in liquid H2O. Thus, it can be concluded that
ionisation cluster size distributions measured with a nanodosimeter device are
suited as benchmark data for approaches that model radiation induced damage to
DNA in nanometric volumes of liquid H2O in simple geometries such as cylinders
or spheres, provided that the nanodosimeter's target volume is characterised
accordingly. By proper selection of drift-time window length as well as target
gas and density a wide range of target volume dimensions in terms of liquid H2O
can be realised with the PTB Ion Counter nanodosimeter according to specific
requirements of modelling approaches.

traditional adversarial adaptation with two novel discriminator tasks that
learns a common subspace shared by all domains. Furthermore, we propose to
divide the target domain into the easy-to-adapt and hard-to-adapt domain, which

insulators, and has the defining characteristic that it hosts helical edge
channels at zero magnetic field, leading to a finite spin Hall conductivity.
The spin Hall conductivity is understood as the difference of the contributions
of two spin states. In the effective four-band BHZ model, these two spin states
appear as two uncoupled blocks in the Hamiltonian matrix. However, this idea
breaks down if additional degrees of freedom are considered. The two blocks
cannot be identified by proper spin $S_z$ or total angular momentum $J_z$, both
not conserved quantum numbers. In this work, we discuss a notion of block
structure for the more general k.p model, defined by a conserved quantum number
that we call isoparity, a combination of parity $z\to-z$ and spin. Isoparity
remains a conserved quantity under a wide range of conditions, in particular in
presence of a perpendicular external magnetic field. From point-group
considerations, isoparity is fundamentally defined as the action of $z\to-z$ on
the spatial and spinorial degrees of freedom. Since time reversal anticommutes
with isoparity, the two blocks act as Kramers partners. The combination of
conductivity and isoparity defines spin conductivity. This generalized notion
of spin Hall conductivity uncovers the meaning of 'spin': It is not the proper
spin $S_z$, but a crystal symmetry that is realized by a spinorial
representation.

models, either in computational statistics or more recently in the context of
Bayesian Neural Networks. The computational cost of usual Monte Carlo methods
for sampling posterior laws in Bayesian inference scales linearly with the
number of data points. One option to reduce it to a fraction of this cost is to
resort to mini-batching in conjunction with unadjusted discretizations of
Langevin dynamics, in which case only a random fraction of the data is used to
estimate the gradient. However, this leads to an additional noise in the
dynamics and hence a bias on the invariant measure which is sampled by the
Markov chain. We advocate using the so-called Adaptive Langevin dynamics, which
is a modification of standard inertial Langevin dynamics with a dynamical
friction which automatically corrects for the increased noise arising from
mini-batching. We investigate the practical relevance of the assumptions
underpinning Adaptive Langevin (constant covariance for the estimation of the
gradient, Gaussian minibatching noise), which are not satisfied in typical
models of Bayesian inference, and quantify the bias induced by minibatching in
this case. We also suggest a possible extension of AdL to further reduce the
bias on the posterior distribution, by considering a dynamical friction

development and evaluation of an explainable prediction model that would

development is based on a data management pipeline that detects the best

Therefore, the most balanced explainable predictive model implements an extreme

cross-validation technique and with new unseen data respectively. In addition,
an analysis of the model's explainability shows that the packed cell value is
the most relevant feature that influences the prediction results of the model,
followed by specific gravity and hypertension. This small number of feature

classic Bregman proximal point algorithm (BPPA) and introduce a new inexact
stopping condition for solving the subproblems, which can circumvent the
underlying feasibility difficulty often appearing in existing inexact
conditions when the problem has a complex feasible set. Our inexact condition
also covers several existing inexact conditions as special cases and hence
makes our inexact BPPA (iBPPA) more flexible to fit different scenarios in
practice. Moreover, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration technique, we develop
an inertial variant of our iBPPA, denoted by V-iBPPA, and establish the
iteration complexity of $O(1/k^{\lambda})$, where $\lambda\geq1$ is a
quadrangle scaling exponent of the kernel function. In particular, when the
proximal parameter is a constant and the kernel function is strongly convex
with Lipschitz continuous gradient (hence $\lambda=2$), our V-iBPPA achieves a
faster rate of $O(1/k^2)$ just as existing accelerated inexact proximal point
algorithms. Some preliminary numerical experiments for solving the standard OT
problem are conducted to show the convergence behaviors of our iBPPA and
V-iBPPA under different inexactness settings. The experiments also empirically
verify the potential of our V-iBPPA on improving the convergence speed.

results show that the tails of its degree distributions exhibits a distinct
power law feature, providing robust theoretical support for the ubiquity of the

factors, network size and node disappearance probability, point to the
existence of the power law feature in the observed networks. As network size
reduces, or as the probability of node disappearance increases, then the power
law feature becomes increasingly difficult to observe. Finally, we suggest that
an effective way of detecting the power law property is to observe the
asymptotic (limiting) behaviour of the degree distribution within its effective

Therefore, designing an efficient training approach is indispensable. The heavy

transformations, such as scale and rotation, robust to occlusions and clutter,
and capable of generalising to different application domains. We present a
simple yet effective method to learn general and distinctive 3D local
descriptors that can be used to register point clouds that are captured in
different domains. Point cloud patches are extracted, canonicalised with
respect to their local reference frame, and encoded into scale and
rotation-invariant compact descriptors by a deep neural network that is
invariant to permutations of the input points. This design is what enables our
descriptors to generalise across domains. We evaluate and compare our
descriptors with alternative handcrafted and deep learning-based descriptors on
several indoor and outdoor datasets that are reconstructed by using both RGBD
sensors and laser scanners. Our descriptors outperform most recent descriptors
by a large margin in terms of generalisation, and also become the state of the
art in benchmarks where training and testing are performed in the same domain.

  essentially the same",,,,"cs.DM math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The subject of this textbook is the analysis of Boolean functions. Roughly
speaking, this refers to studying Boolean functions $f : \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$
via their Fourier expansion and other analytic means. Boolean functions are
perhaps the most basic object of study in theoretical computer science, and
Fourier analysis has become an indispensable tool in the field. The topic has
also played a key role in several other areas of mathematics, from
combinatorics, random graph theory, and statistical physics, to Gaussian
geometry, metric/Banach spaces, and social choice theory.
  The intent of this book is both to develop the foundations of the field and
to give a wide (though far from exhaustive) overview of its applications. Each
chapter ends with a ""highlight"" showing the power of analysis of Boolean
functions in different subject areas: property testing, social choice,
cryptography, circuit complexity, learning theory, pseudorandomness, hardness
of approximation, concrete complexity, and random graph theory.
  The book can be used as a reference for working researchers or as the basis
of a one-semester graduate-level course. The author has twice taught such a
course at Carnegie Mellon University, attended mainly by graduate students in
computer science and mathematics but also by advanced undergraduates, postdocs,
and researchers in adjacent fields. In both years most of Chapters 1-5 and 7
were covered, along with parts of Chapters 6, 8, 9, and 11, and some additional
material on additive combinatorics. Nearly 500 exercises are provided at the
ends of the book's chapters.

the well-studied peak set of pi where one considers values rather than
positions. The pinnacle set was introduced by Davis, Nelson, Petersen, and
Tenner who showed that it has many interesting properties. In particular, they
proved that the number of subsets of [n] = {1, 2, ..., n} which can be the
pinnacle set of some permutation is a binomial coefficient. Their proof
involved a bijection with lattice paths and was somewhat involved. We give a
simpler demonstration of this result which does not need lattice paths.
Moreover, we show that our map and theirs are different descriptions of the
same function. Davis et al. also studied the number of pinnacle sets with
maximum m and cardinality d which they denoted by p(m,d). We show that these
integers are ballot numbers and give two proofs of this fact: one using finite
differences and one bijective. Diaz-Lopez, Harris, Huang, Insko, and Nilsen
found a summation formula for calculating the number of permutations in S_n

is faster to calculate in many cases. We also show how this method can be
adapted to find the number of orderings of a pinnacle set which can be realized

a pixel-based dynamics model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose
to learn a particle-based dynamics model from a partial point cloud
observation. To overcome the challenges of partial observability, we infer
which visible points are connected on the underlying cloth mesh. We then learn
a dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared to previous
learning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with its
particle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it is
invariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily
visualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in

deploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model

has demonstrated the susceptibility of CPS to False Data Injection Attacks
(False Data Injection Attacks (fdias), which can cause significant damage. We
identify a new category of attacks on these systems. In this paper, we
demonstrate that DNN based CPS are also subject to these attacks. These
attacks, which we call Ripple False Data Injection Attacks (rfdia), use minimal
input perturbations to stealthily change the dnn output. The input
perturbations propagate as ripples through multiple dnn layers to affect the
output in a targeted manner. We develop an automated technique to synthesize
rfdias against DNN-based CPS. Our technique models the attack as an
optimization problem using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (Mixed Integer

us to automatically: 1) identify the critical inputs, and 2) find the smallest

flexible medium through which humans can communicate with collaborative robots.
Natural language provides one such medium, and through significant progress in
statistical methods for natural-language understanding, robots are now able to
interpret a diverse array of free-form commands. However, most contemporary
approaches require a detailed, prior spatial-semantic map of the robot's
environment that models the space of possible referents of an utterance.
Consequently, these methods fail when robots are deployed in new, previously
unknown, or partially-observed environments, particularly when mental models of
the environment differ between the human operator and the robot. This paper
provides a comprehensive description of a novel learning framework that allows
field and service robots to interpret and correctly execute natural-language
instructions in a priori unknown, unstructured environments. Integral to our
approach is its use of language as a ""sensor"" -- inferring spatial,
topological, and semantic information implicit in the utterance and then
exploiting this information to learn a distribution over a latent environment
model. We incorporate this distribution in a probabilistic, language grounding
model and infer a distribution over a symbolic representation of the robot's
action space. We use imitation learning to identify a belief-space policy that
reasons over the environment and behavior distributions. We evaluate our

areas. On one hand, most of the theoretically-justified methods are
investigated in an ideal setting without model violations, or merely robust
against identical heavy-tailed noise distribution across time and/or against
isolate outliers; on the other hand, we are aware that there have been
exponentially growing attacks from adversaries, who may pose systematic
contamination on data to purposely create spurious change points or disguise
true change points. In light of the timely need for a change point detection
method that is robust against adversaries, we start with, arguably, the
simplest univariate mean change point detection problem. The adversarial
attacks are formulated through the Huber $\varepsilon$-contamination framework,
which in particular allows the contamination distributions to be different at
each time point. In this paper, we demonstrate a phase transition phenomenon in
change point detection. This detection boundary is a function of the
contamination proportion $\varepsilon$ and is the first time shown in the
literature. In addition, we derive the minimax-rate optimal localisation error
rate, quantifying the cost of accuracy in terms of the contamination
proportion. We propose a computationally feasible method, matching the minimax
lower bound under certain conditions, saving for logarithmic factors. Extensive
numerical experiments are conducted with comparisons to robust change point
detection methods in the existing literature.

standard for diagnosis and prognosis is the Gleason grading system. In this

computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as a promising tool that
could support pathologists in the daily clinical practice. Nevertheless, these
systems are usually trained using tedious and prone-to-error pixel-level
annotations of Gleason grades in the tissue. To alleviate the need of manual

deep-learning model, based on self-learning CNNs, that leverages only the
global Gleason score of gigapixel whole slide images during training to
accurately perform both, grading of patch-level patterns and biopsy-level

extensive experiments on three different external datasets for the patch-level
Gleason grading, and on two different test sets for global Grade Group

the proposed model brings an average improvement on the Cohen's quadratic kappa

combination of galaxies imaged from the CANDELS program and various high-$z$

iteratively through a process of generating new strategies based on learning

is how to direct this process so to construct effective models with minimal
iteration. A variety of approaches have been proposed in the literature,
including methods based on classic techniques and novel concepts. Comparing the
performance of these alternatives can be surprisingly subtle, depending
sensitively on criteria adopted and measures employed. We investigate some of
the methodological considerations in evaluating strategy exploration, defining
key distinctions and identifying a few general principles based on examples and
experimental observations. In particular, we emphasize the fact that empirical
games create a space of strategies that should be evaluated as a whole. Based
on this fact, we suggest that the minimum regret constrained profile (MRCP)
provides a particularly robust basis for evaluating a space of strategies, and
propose a local search method for MRCP that outperforms previous approaches.
However, the computation of MRCP is not always feasible especially in large
games. In this scenario, we highlight consistency considerations for comparing
across different approaches. Surprisingly, we find that recent works violate
these considerations that are necessary for evaluation, which may result in
misleading conclusions on the performance of different approaches. For proper
evaluation, we propose a new evaluation scheme and demonstrate that our scheme

we propose the low-memory implementations for the recently proposed recursive

among the least unlikely solutions to the Hubble tension, and would be expected
to leave an important signature in the early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (eISW)
effect, a source of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies arising from
the time-variation of gravitational potentials when the Universe was not
completely matter dominated. Why, then, is there no clear evidence for new
physics from the CMB alone, and why does the $\Lambda$CDM model fit CMB data so
well? These questions and the vastness of the Hubble tension theory model space
motivate general consistency tests of $\Lambda$CDM. I perform an eISW-based
consistency test of $\Lambda$CDM introducing the parameter $A_{\rm eISW}$,
which rescales the eISW contribution to the CMB power spectra. A fit to Planck
CMB data yields $A_{\rm eISW}=0.988 \pm 0.027$, in perfect agreement with the
$\Lambda$CDM expectation $A_{\rm eISW}=1$, and posing an important challenge
for early-time new physics, which I illustrate in a case study focused on early
dark energy (EDE). I explicitly show that the increase in $\omega_c$ needed for
EDE to preserve the fit to the CMB, which has been argued to worsen the fit to
weak lensing and galaxy clustering measurements, is specifically required to
lower the amplitude of the eISW effect, which would otherwise exceed
$\Lambda$CDM's prediction by $\approx 20\%$: this is a generic problem beyond
EDE and likely applying to most models enhancing the expansion rate around
recombination. Early-time new physics models invoked to address the Hubble
tension are therefore faced with the significant challenge of making a similar
prediction to $\Lambda$CDM for the eISW effect, while not degrading the fit to
other measurements in doing so.

flows of around $20$ to $30$ m/s are first visible one day prior to emergence,

mean (GM) of the per-cell max-min SE. To solve this new optimization problem,
we prove that it can be rewritten in a convex optimization form and then solved
using standard tools. The simulation results highlight the benefits of our
model which is balancing between NW-PF and NW-MMF.

costing over 1 billion USD on average per drug and taking 10-15 years. To
reduce the high levels of attrition throughout the process, there has been a
growing interest in applying machine learning methodologies to various stages
of drug discovery and development in the recent decade, especially at the
earliest stage identification of druggable disease genes. In this paper, we
have developed a new tensor factorisation model to predict potential drug
targets (genes or proteins) for treating diseases. We created a three
dimensional data tensor consisting of 1,048 gene targets, 860 diseases and
230,011 evidence attributes and clinical outcomes connecting them, using data
extracted from the Open Targets and PharmaProjects databases. We enriched the
data with gene target representations learned from a drug discovery oriented
knowledge graph and applied our proposed method to predict the clinical
outcomes for unseen gene target and disease pairs. We designed three evaluation
strategies to measure the prediction performance and benchmarked several
commonly used machine learning classifiers together with Bayesian matrix and
tensor factorisation methods. The result shows that incorporating knowledge
graph embeddings significantly improves the prediction accuracy and that
training tensor factorisation alongside a dense neural network outperforms all
other baselines. In summary, our framework combines two actively studied
machine learning approaches to disease target identification, namely tensor
factorisation and knowledge graph representation learning, which could be a
promising avenue for further exploration in data driven drug discovery.

foundries continuously shrink the technology nodes and electronic design
automation (EDA) vendors offer hierarchical design flows to decompose systems
into smaller blocks. However, such a staged design methodology consists of
various levels of abstraction, where margins will be accumulated and result in
degradation of the overall design quality. This limits the full use of
capabilities of both the process technology and EDA tools. In this work, a
study of drive granularity of standard cells is performed and an interpolation
method is proposed for drive option expansion within original cell libraries.
These aim to investigate how industrial synthesis tools deal with the drive
strength selection using different granularity sets. In addition, a
fully-automated, multi-objective (MO) EDA digital flow is introduced for power,
performance, area (PPA) optimisation based on drive strength refinement. This
population-based search method better handles the increased difficulty of cell
selection when using larger logic libraries, producing better optimised
solutions than standard tool flow in this case. The achieved experimental
results demonstrate how the improved drive granularity cells overall enhance
the quality of designs and how a significant improvement in trading off PPA is
achieved by the MOEDA flow.

availability of large annotated datasets. To alleviate the annotation cost, the
research community has explored a number of ways to exploit unlabeled or weakly
labeled data. However, such efforts have met with limited success so far. In
this work, we revisit the problem with a pragmatic standpoint, trying to
explore a new balance between detection performance and annotation cost by
jointly exploiting fully and weakly annotated data. Specifically, we propose a
weakly- and semi-supervised object detection framework (WSSOD), which involves
a two-stage learning procedure. An agent detector is first trained on a joint
dataset and then used to predict pseudo bounding boxes on weakly-annotated
images. The underlying assumptions in the current as well as common
semi-supervised pipelines are also carefully examined under a unified EM
formulation. On top of this framework, weakly-supervised loss (WSL), label
attention and random pseudo-label sampling (RPS) strategies are introduced to
relax these assumptions, bringing additional improvement on the efficacy of the
detection pipeline. The proposed framework demonstrates remarkable performance
on PASCAL-VOC and MSCOCO benchmark, achieving a high performance comparable to
those obtained in fully-supervised settings, with only one third of the
annotations.

this paper. We consider the TSE as a spatiotemporal matrix
completion/interpolation problem, and apply spatiotemporal delay embedding to
transform the original incomplete matrix into a fourth-order Hankel structured
tensor. By imposing a low-rank assumption on this tensor structure, we can
approximate and characterize both global and local spatiotemporal patterns in a
data-driven manner. We use the truncated nuclear norm of a balanced
spatiotemporal unfolding -- in which each column represents the vectorization
of a small patch in the original matrix -- to approximate the tensor rank. An
efficient solution algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) is developed for model learning. The proposed framework only
involves two hyperparameters, spatial and temporal window lengths, which are
easy to set given the degree of data sparsity. We conduct numerical experiments

taken into account. It is shown that the collision integral associated with
impurity scattering as well as the usual drift term is derived on an equal

Wigner function scheme is inconsistent in the sense that the collision integral
is introduced in an ad hoc way and, thus, the short-range part of the impurity

without imposing an assumption of random impurity configurations over the

small bio-particles: extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosomes and viruses of
nanometer scale in flow cytometry. By introducing a new laser configuration in
place of conventional optical system of the flow cytometry, the interference
fringe (periodic intensity modulation) is created inside the flow which
provides a calibrated scale for the size measurement. The fringe pitch is
precisely determined by the crossing angle of laser beams and the wavelength.
The transverse size of the beam spot can be much larger than wavelength, for
example, 30 micro-meters, where the flow cell design in conventional system can
be used with moderated dimensional tolerance. The interaction length of sample
with laser becomes longer: ~30 micro-meter and thus the scattering light and
fluorescent light in case of labeled particle becomes much higher. Importantly,
those signals are modulated in MHz frequency range associated with the periodic
intensity modulation of the interference fringe. By measuring modulation depth,
we can determine the particle size. We may utilize a bandpass filter or the
digital signal processing of FFT, and thus we can drastically improve S/N
ratio. This is because of the narrow spectrum of signal and thus effectively
eliminates noise from various debris contained in the sample, and also low
frequency shot noise in the photo detector signal. Thanks to the
above-mentioned merits, it will be possible to measure the size of EVs and
exosomes in particle-by-particle basis in reliable dimensional scale at
nano-meter resolution. It will be also possible to realize the fast virus
detection system for screening passengers in the airport at the current

detrimental effect. Finally, network models still achieved high test accuracy
when correct labels are diluted towards confusing labels; this behavior hold
across several classes.

  of the Neuronal Design","40 pages, 6 figures; added a section",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Understanding the basic operational logics of the nervous system is essential
to advancing neuroscientific research. However, theoretical efforts to tackle
this fundamental problem are lacking, despite the abundant empirical data about
the brain that has been collected in the past few decades. To address this
shortcoming, this document introduces a hypothetical framework for the
functional nature of primitive neural networks. It analyzes the idea that the
activity of neurons and synapses can symbolically reenact the dynamic changes
in the world and thus enable an adaptive system of behavior. More
significantly, the network achieves this without participating in an
algorithmic structure. When a neuron's activation represents some symbolic
element in the environment, each of its synapses can indicate a potential
change to the element and its future state. The efficacy of a synaptic
connection further specifies the element's particular probability for, or
contribution to, such a change. As it fires, a neuron's activation is
transformed to its postsynaptic targets, resulting in a chronological shift of
the represented elements. As the inherent function of summation in a neuron
integrates the various presynaptic contributions, the neural network mimics the
collective causal relationship of events in the observed environment.

  Next-Generation Benchmarking",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce Dynaboard, an evaluation-as-a-service framework for hosting
benchmarks and conducting holistic model comparison, integrated with the
Dynabench platform. Our platform evaluates NLP models directly instead of
relying on self-reported metrics or predictions on a single dataset. Under this
paradigm, models are submitted to be evaluated in the cloud, circumventing the
issues of reproducibility, accessibility, and backwards compatibility that
often hinder benchmarking in NLP. This allows users to interact with uploaded
models in real time to assess their quality, and permits the collection of
additional metrics such as memory use, throughput, and robustness, which --
despite their importance to practitioners -- have traditionally been absent
from leaderboards. On each task, models are ranked according to the Dynascore,
a novel utility-based aggregation of these statistics, which users can
customize to better reflect their preferences, placing more/less weight on a
particular axis of evaluation or dataset. As state-of-the-art NLP models push
the limits of traditional benchmarks, Dynaboard offers a standardized solution
for a more diverse and comprehensive evaluation of model quality.

  Photogrammetry to Identify ""Icing"" Variability and Processes","18 pages, 9 figures, minor revisions following review by MDPI Remote
  Sensing",,,,"physics.geo-ph physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Current climate shift has significant impacts on both quality and quantity of
snow precipitation. This directly influences spatial variability of the
snowpack as well as cumulative snow height. Contemporary glacier retreat
reorganizes periglacial morphology: while the glacier area decreases, the
moraine area increases. The latter is becoming a new water storage potential
almost as important as the glacier itself, but with a much more complex
topography. This work hence fills one of the missing variables of the
hydrological budget equation of an arctic glacier basin by providing an
estimate of the snow water equivalent (SWE) of the moraine contribution. Such a
result is achieved by investigating Structure from Motion (SfM) image
processing applied to pictures collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
as a method to produce snow depth maps over the proglacial moraine area.
Several UAV campaigns were carried out on a small glacial basin in Spitsbergen
(Arctic): measurements were made at the maximum snow accumulation season (late
April) while reference topography maps were acquired at the end of hydrological
year (late September) when the moraine is mostly free of snow. Snow depth is
determined from Digital Surface Model (DSM) subtraction. Using dedicated and
natural ground control points for relative positioning of the DSMs, the
relative DSM georeferencing with sub-meter accuracy removes the main source of
uncertainty when assessing snow depth. For areas where snow is deposited on
bare rock surfaces, the correlation between avalanche probe in-situ snow depth
measurements and DSM differences is excellent. Differences in ice covered areas
between the two measurement techniques are attributed to the different
quantities measured.

clinical indicators such as cell density, coefficient of variation,and
hexagonality. However, the corneal endothelium's uneven reflectionand the
subject's tremor and movement cause blurred cell edges in theimage, which is
difficult to segment, and need more details and contextinformation to release
this problem. Due to the limited receptive field oflocal convolution and
continuous downsampling, the existing deep learn-ing segmentation methods
cannot make full use of global context andmiss many details. This paper
proposes a Multi-Branch hybrid Trans-former Network (MBT-Net) based on the
transformer and body-edgebranch. Firstly, We use the convolutional block to
focus on local tex-ture feature extraction and establish long-range
dependencies over space,channel, and layer by the transformer and residual
connection. Besides,We use the body-edge branch to promote local consistency
and to provideedge position information. On the self-collected dataset
TM-EM3000 andpublic Alisarine dataset, compared with other State-Of-The-Art

miniature pressure sensor based on the whispering gallery modes (WGMs)
optically excited in a dielectric microsphere placed near a flexible reflective
membrane which acts as an ambient pressure sensing element. WGMs excitation is
carried out by free-space coupling of optical radiation to a microsphere. The
distinctive feature of proposed sensor design is double excitation of optical
eigenmodes by forward and backward propagating radiation reflected from a
membrane that causes WGMs interference in particle volume. The optical
intensity of resulting resonant field established in the microsphere carries
information about the exact position of the pressure-loaded reflecting
membrane. The sensitivity of the proposed sensor strongly depends on the
quality factor of the excited resonant mode, as well as geometrical and
mechanical parameters of the flexible membrane. Important advantages of the
proposed sensor are miniature design (linear sensor dimensions depends only on
the membrane diameter) and the absence of a mechanical contact of
pressure-sensitive element with WGM resonator.
