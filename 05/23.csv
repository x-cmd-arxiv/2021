a limited amount of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Recent works
build deep neural networks for anomaly detection by discriminatively mapping
the normal samples and abnormal samples to different regions in the feature
space or fitting different distributions. However, due to the limited number of
annotated anomaly samples, directly training networks with the discriminative
loss may not be sufficient. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel
strategy to transform the input data into a more meaningful representation that
could be used for anomaly detection. Specifically, we leverage an autoencoder
to encode the input data and utilize three factors, hidden representation,
reconstruction residual vector, and reconstruction error, as the new
representation for the input data. This representation amounts to encode a test
sample with its projection on the training data manifold, its direction to its
projection and its distance to its projection. In addition to this encoding, we
also propose a novel network architecture to seamlessly incorporate those three
factors. From our extensive experiments, the benefits of the proposed strategy
are clearly demonstrated by its superior performance over the competitive
methods.

classification framework (MF2SCF) by fusing local, global, and color features
of HSR images. Specifically, we first extract the local features with the help
of image slicing and densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet), where
the outputs of dense blocks in the fine-tuned DenseNet-121 model are jointly
averaged and concatenated to describe local features. Second, from the
perspective of complex networks (CN), we model a HSR image as an undirected
graph based on pixel distance, intensity, and gradient, and obtain a gray-scale
image (GSI), a gradient of image (GoI), and three CN-based feature images to
delineate global features. To make the global feature descriptor resist to the
impact of rotation and illumination, we apply uniform local binary patterns
(LBP) on GSI, GoI, and feature images, respectively, and generate the final
global feature representation by concatenating spatial histograms. Third, the
color features are determined based on the normalized HSV histogram, where HSV
stands for hue, saturation, and value, respectively. Finally, three feature
vectors are jointly concatenated for scene classification. Experiment results
show that MF2SCF significantly improves the classification accuracy compared
with state-of-the-art LBP-based methods and deep learning-based methods.

  the Fly","Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The learning rate (LR) schedule is one of the most important hyper-parameters
needing careful tuning in training DNNs. However, it is also one of the least
automated parts of machine learning systems and usually costs significant
manual effort and computing. Though there are pre-defined LR schedules and
optimizers with adaptive LR, they introduce new hyperparameters that need to be
tuned separately for different tasks/datasets. In this paper, we consider the
question: Can we automatically tune the LR over the course of training without
human involvement? We propose an efficient method, AutoLRS, which automatically
optimizes the LR for each training stage by modeling training dynamics. AutoLRS
aims to find an LR applied to every $\tau$ steps that minimizes the resulted
validation loss. We solve this black-box optimization on the fly by Bayesian
optimization (BO). However, collecting training instances for BO requires a
system to evaluate each LR queried by BO's acquisition function for $\tau$
steps, which is prohibitively expensive in practice. Instead, we apply each
candidate LR for only $\tau'\ll\tau$ steps and train an exponential model to
predict the validation loss after $\tau$ steps. This mutual-training process
between BO and the loss-prediction model allows us to limit the training steps
invested in the BO search. We demonstrate the advantages and the generality of
AutoLRS through extensive experiments of training DNNs for tasks from diverse
domains using different optimizers. The LR schedules auto-generated by AutoLRS
lead to a speedup of $1.22\times$, $1.43\times$, and $1.5\times$ when training
ResNet-50, Transformer, and BERT, respectively, compared to the LR schedules in
their original papers, and an average speedup of $1.31\times$ over
state-of-the-art heavily-tuned LR schedules.

intergalactic medium (IGM) during reionization. At $z>6$, a typical galaxy
without an active galactic nucleus fails to form a proximity zone around itself
due to the overdensity of the surrounding IGM. The gravitational infall motion
in the IGM makes the resonance absorption extend to the red side of Ly$\alpha$,
suppressing the transmission up to roughly the circular velocity of the galaxy.
In some sight lines, an optically thin blob generated by a supernova in a
neighboring galaxy results in a peak feature, which can be mistaken for a blue
peak. Redward of the resonance absorption, the damping-wing opacity correlates
with the global IGM neutral fraction and the UV magnitude of the source galaxy.
Brighter galaxies tend to suffer lower opacity because they tend to reside in
larger HII regions, and the surrounding IGM transmits redder photons, which are
less susceptible to attenuation, owing to stronger infall velocity. The HII
regions are highly nonspherical, causing both sight-line-to-sight-line and
galaxy-to-galaxy variation in opacity. Also, self-shielded systems within HII
regions strongly attenuate the emission for certain sight lines. All these
factors add to the transmissivity variation, requiring a large sample size to
constrain the average transmission. The variation is largest for fainter
galaxies at higher redshift. The 68\% range of the transmissivity is similar to
or greater than the median for galaxies with $M_{\rm UV}\ge-21$ at $z\ge7$,

Many families of valid inequalities for the multilinear set are available in
the literature, though giving a polyhedral characterization of the convex hull

this paper, we study the cardinality constrained multilinear set in the special

this approach to arbitrary nonconvex polyhedra by generalizing strip flattening
to nonorthogonal corners and slicing along a countably infinite number of

this ratio during training. By stochastically masking labels during loss
computation, the method balances this ratio for each class, leading to improved
recall on minority classes and improved precision on frequent classes. The
ratio is estimated adaptively based on the network's performance by minimizing
the KL divergence between predicted and ground-truth distributions. Whereas
most existing approaches addressing data imbalance are mainly focused on
single-label classification and do not generalize well to the multi-label case,
this work proposes a general approach to solve the long-tail data imbalance
issue for multi-label classification. PLM is versatile: it can be applied to
most objective functions and it can be used alongside other strategies for
class imbalance. Our method achieves strong performance when compared to
existing methods on both multi-label (MultiMNIST and MSCOCO) and single-label
(imbalanced CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) image classification datasets.

non-entangled three-level atoms (2,3) and (6,7) in two-mode cavities with
photon leakage rates in the presence of spontaneous emission leads to producing
entanglement between atoms (1,4) and (5,8), separately. Finally, the
entanglement between atoms (1,8) is successfully produced by performing
interaction between atoms (4,5) while spontaneous emission is considered in a
dissipative cavity. In the continuation, the effects of detuning, dissipation
and initial interaction time are considered on negativity and success
probability of the processes. The maxima of negativity are decreased by
increasing the detuning, in most cases. Also, the time evolution of negativity
is non-periodic in the presence of dissipation. Increasing the initial
interaction time has a constructive effect on negativity in all considered
cases. The oscillations of negativity are destroyed as time goes on and the
produced entanglement is stabled. The success probability of entangled state of
atoms (1,8) is tunable by controlling the detuning and dissipation. We show
that via justifying the involved parameters one can arrive at conditions in

Higgs bosons originating from cascade decays of pair-produced new quarks.
Decays of vectorlike quarks through heavy Higgses can easily dominate in the
two Higgs doublet model of type-II, and the studied signatures are common to
many possible decay chains. We design search strategies for these final states
and discuss the mass ranges of heavy Higgs bosons and new quarks that can be
explored at the Large Hadron Collider as functions of branching ratios in a
model independent way. We further combine the results with a similar study
focusing on decays which lead to a $6b$ final state and interpret the
sensitivity to charged and neutral Higgs bosons and vectorlike quarks in the
type-II two Higgs doublet model. We find that the LHC reach for their masses
extends to well above 2 TeV in the case of an SU(2) doublet quark and to at
least 1.8 TeV for a bottom-like SU(2) singlet quark in the whole range of
$\tan\beta$ between 1 and 50.

AOT. AOT comprises three levels of nodes, where nodes at each level perform a

messages ready to be retrieved. Each receiver checks the bulletin board,
identifies tags, and receives the associated messages using OT. A receiver can
receive their messages even if the receiver is offline when messages are ready.

challenging problem, because learning on mislabeled examples deteriorates the

randomly modifying the labels of training examples of clean datasets. However,
no final conclusions can be derived by just using this random noise, since it
excludes feature-dependent noise. Thus, it is imperative to generate
feature-dependent noisy datasets that additionally provide ground truth.
Therefore, we propose an intuitive approach to creating feature-dependent noisy
datasets by utilizing the training predictions of DNNs on clean datasets that
also retain true label information. We refer to these datasets as ""Pseudo Noisy

We further randomly generate synthetic noisy datasets with the same noise

empirically show that i) learning is easier with feature-dependent label noise
compared to random noise, ii) irrespective of noise distribution, Pseudo noisy
datasets mimic feature-dependent label noise and iii) current training methods
are not generalizable to feature-dependent label noise. Therefore, we believe
that Pseudo noisy datasets will be quite helpful to study and develop robust

quantum gravity, propose areas instead of lengths as fundamental variables. The
Area Regge action, which can be defined for general 4D triangulations, is a
natural choice for an action based on areas. It does indeed appear in the
semi-classical limit of spin foam models. The Area Regge action does however
only lead to a discrete version of the gravitational equations of motion, if
one implements constraints, that ensure that the areas are compatible with a
consistent length assignment to the edges of the triangulation. The constrained
version is then classically equivalent to the Length Regge action, which
provides a discretization of the Einstein-Hilbert action.
  Here we perform the first systematic analysis of the Area Regge dynamics on a

action on a hyper-cubical lattice does single out the Length Regge action by
its scaling behaviour in the lattice constant. That is, integrating out the

Contractile stress suppresses the flows perpendicular to the layer and favours
in-plane orientations of the director. By contrast, extensile stress promotes
instabilities that can turn the director out of the plane, leaving behind a
population of distinct, in-plane regions that continually elongate and divide.
This supports extensile forces as a mechanism for the initial stages of layer
formation in living systems, and we show that a planar drop with extensile
(contractile) activity grows into three dimensions (remains in two dimensions).
The results also explain the propensity of disclination lines in three

contain water-bearing minerals, attesting that both water-ice and dust were
accreted on their parent asteroids. Nonetheless, the hydrogen isotopic
composition (D/H) of water in the different chondrite groups remains poorly
constrained, due to the intimate mixture of hydrated minerals and organic
compounds, the other main H-bearing phase in chondrites. Building on our recent
works using in situ secondary ion mass spectrometry analyses, we determined the
H isotopic composition of water in a large set of chondritic samples (CI, CM,
CO, CR, and C-ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites) and report that water in each
group shows a distinct and unique D/H signature. Based on a comparison with
literature data on bulk chondrites and their water and organics, our data do
not support a preponderant role of parent-body processes in controlling the D/H
variations among chondrites. Instead, we propose that the water and organic D/H
signatures were mostly shaped by interactions between the protoplanetary disk
and the molecular cloud that episodically fed the disk over several million
years. Because the preservation of D-rich interstellar water and/or organics in
chondritic materials is only possible below their respective sublimation
temperatures (160 and 350-450 K), the H isotopic signatures of chondritic
materials depend on both the timing and location at which their parent body
formed.

implement photonic molecules using high quality factor photonic integrated ring
resonators due to their narrow atom-like spectral resonance, tunability, and
the ability to scale the number of resonators on a photonic circuit. However,
to take full advantage of molecule spectral complexity and tuning degree of
freedom, resonator structures should have full symmetry in terms of
inter-resonator coupling and resonator-waveguide coupling as well as
independent resonance tuning, and low power dissipation operation, in a
scalable integration platform. To date, photonic molecule symmetry has been
limited to dual- and triple-cavity geometries coupled to single- or
dual-busses, and resonance tuning limited to dual resonator molecules. In this
paper, we demonstrate a three-resonator photonic molecule, consisting of
symmetrically coupled 8.11 million intrinsic Q silicon nitride rings, where
each ring is coupled to the other two rings. The resonance of each ring, and
that of the collective molecule, is controlled using low power dissipation,
monolithically integrated thin-film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuators
that are integrated with the ultra-low loss silicon nitride resonators. This
performance is achieved without undercut waveguides, yielding the highest Q to
date for a PZT controlled resonator. This advance leads to full control of
complex photonic molecule resonance spectra and splitting in a wafer-scale
integration platform. The resulting six tunable supermodes can be fully
controlled, including degeneracy, location and splitting as well as designed by
a model that can accurately predict the energy modes and transmission spectrum
and tunable resonance splitting.

  embeddings through reflection",,,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Dependently-typed host languages empower users to verify a wide range of
properties of embedded languages and programs written in them. Designers of
such embedded languages are faced with a difficult choice between using a
shallow or a deep embedding. The former is easier to use because the entire
infrastructure of the host langauge is immediately available. Meanwhile, the
latter gives full access to the structure of embedded programs, but is
difficult to use in practice, especially when the embedded language is itself
dependently typed.
  The main insight presented in this paper is that the choice between shallow
and deep embedding can be eliminated by working in a host language with
reflection capabilities: we start from a shallow embedding that can use all
libraries and tools of the host language, and later use reflection to expose
the deep structure of the embedded programs.
  Concretely, we apply this technique to embed three programming languages --
Kaleidoscope, SaC, and (a subset of) APL -- into the dependently typed theorem
prover Agda, using dependent types to statically enforce several properties of
interest. We then use Agda's reflection capabilities to extract the embedded
programs back into the original language, so that the existing toolchain can be
leveraged.
  In this process, statically verified properties of the host language are
mapped onto runtime checks in the target language, allowing extracted programs
to interact safely with existing code.
  Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with the
implementation and extraction of a convolutional neural network in our
embedding of APL.\@

able to detect tracks over focal distances of about tens of centimeters. From

We are interested in the hypothesis $P^* \in H_0$ for a target distribution

$P^*$ is related to $Q^*$ through a known shift $\tau$ and formally introduce
hypothesis testing in this setting. We propose a general testing procedure that
first resamples from the observed data to construct an auxiliary data set and
then applies an existing test in the target domain. We prove that if the size
of the resample is at most $o(\sqrt{n})$ and the resampling weights are
well-behaved, this procedure inherits the pointwise asymptotic level and power
from the target test. If the map $\tau$ is estimated from data, we can maintain
the above guarantees under mild conditions if the estimation works sufficiently
well. We further extend our results to finite sample level, uniform asymptotic
level and a different resampling scheme. Testing under distributional shifts
allows us to tackle a diverse set of problems. We argue that it may prove
useful in reinforcement learning and covariate shift, we show how it reduces
conditional to unconditional independence testing and we provide example
applications in causal inference.

individual models but also reduce their miscalibration by averaging independent
predictions. In this scenario, model diversity has become a key factor, which
facilitates individual models converging to different functional solutions. In
this work, we introduce Orthogonal Ensemble Networks (OEN), a novel framework
to explicitly enforce model diversity by means of orthogonal constraints. The
proposed method is based on the hypothesis that inducing orthogonality among
the constituents of the ensemble will increase the overall model diversity. We
resort to a new pairwise orthogonality constraint which can be used to
regularize a sequential ensemble training process, resulting on improved
predictive performance and better calibrated model outputs. We benchmark the
proposed framework in two challenging brain lesion segmentation tasks --brain

  arXiv:2103.10808",,,,"math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, we have introduced and modified two graph-decomposition theorems
based on a new graph product, motivated by applications in the context of
synchronising periodic real-time processes. This vertex-removing synchronised
product (VRSP), is based on modifications of the well-known Cartesian product,
and is closely related to the synchronised product due to Wohrle and Thomas.
Here, we recall the definition of the VRSP and the two modified
graph-decompositions and introduce three new graph-decomposition theorems. The
first new theorem decomposes a graph with respect to the semicomplete bipartite
subgraphs of the graph. For the second new theorem, we introduce a matrix
graph, which is used to decompose a graph in a manner similar to the
decomposition of graphs using the Cartesian product. In the third new theorem,
we combine these two types of decomposition. Ultimately, the goal of these
graph-decomposition theorems is to come to a prime-graph decomposition.

  New Results",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently Bonet and Geffner have shown that first-order representations for
planning domains can be learned from the structure of the state space without
any prior knowledge about the action schemas or domain predicates. For this,
the learning problem is formulated as the search for a simplest first-order
domain description D that along with information about instances I_i (number of
objects and initial state) determine state space graphs G(P_i) that match the
observed state graphs G_i where P_i = (D, I_i). The search is cast and solved
approximately by means of a SAT solver that is called over a large family of
propositional theories that differ just in the parameters encoding the possible
number of action schemas and domain predicates, their arities, and the number
of objects. In this work, we push the limits of these learners by moving to an
answer set programming (ASP) encoding using the CLINGO system. The new
encodings are more transparent and concise, extending the range of possible
models while facilitating their exploration. We show that the domains
introduced by Bonet and Geffner can be solved more efficiently in the new
approach, often optimally, and furthermore, that the approach can be easily
extended to handle partial information about the state graphs as well as noise
that prevents some states from being distinguished.

archive and exhibition project aiming to document and reflect individual
experiences of the COVID-19 lockdowns in Berlin, Germany. What began as an
observational effort in spring 2020became a year-long archive, exhibition, and
broadcasting platform that generated various hyper-local interfaces. The paper
articulates an improvisational approach to media architecture in the form of
self-reflection by the project initiators. Necessitated by the limitations
imposed by the lockdowns on cultural production and public discourse, the paper
presents an alternative conceptual approach to media architecture that is not
based on a fully-specified technological infrastructure for discourse and
interaction but instead on improvisational practices that manifest themselves
in different technical interfaces. This improvisational approach is not merely
a mode of production, but raises questions of about the discourse of media
architecture and its underlying assumptions of methodological rigor. In
traditional HCI, systems and artifacts are often presented as stable and fully
specified, while their users are considered interchangeable. In contrast, we
consider urban media interfaces as improvisation-driven infrastructures (or
improstructures) in which the actors and their relationships are stable, while
the technologies they create are provisional and in flux. As a consequence, the
defining property of media architecture is no longer the structural integration
of media into architecture but the embodiment of mediated communication in
objects and performances at concrete places. In an environment where many
physical spaces are longer accessible and human contact among strangers
diminished, the project explores the restorative function and capacities of
media architecture for shared reflection and discourse in physical public
space.

electricity supply lines for evaluating the number of required repair teams. To
this end, the economic value of distribution system lines has been considered
as a criterion representing the sensitivity of the network to hurricanes. The
modeling is based on value, in which the load value, failure probability of the
poles, fragility curve, duration of line repair by the maintenance team, and
the topology factor have been considered. This is so that the significance of
the demand side, the failure extent and accessibility of the lines, the
importance of time, and the network configuration are considered. The results
provide a list of line priority for fault resolution, in which the topology
factor has a larger effect. The number of repair teams required to restore
critical and important loads is determined from this model. This modeling has

the sense that they react in the presence of the particles in an attractive
manner: when the particle collides with an obstacle, it is attached during a
random time (adsorption time), i.e., it gets adsorbed by an obstacle;
thereafter the particle is detached from the obstacle and continues its motion
in a random direction. We give an analytical formula for the effective
diffusion coefficient when the mean adsorption time is finite. When the mean
adsorption time is infinite, we show that the system undergoes a transition
from a normal to anomalous diffusion regime. We also show that another
transition takes place in the mean number of adsorbed particles: in the
anomalous diffusion phase all the particles become adsorbed in the average. We
show that the fraction of adsorbed particles, seen as an order parameter of the
system, undergoes a second-order-like phase transition, because the fraction of
adsorbed particles is not differentiable but changes continuously as a function
of a parameter of the model.

the dimerized Toda lattice by introducing alternating bondings specified by a
certain parameter $\lambda $, where it is reduced to the Toda lattice at
$\lambda =0$. In this work, we investigate the topological dynamics of the
voltage along the transmission line. It is demonstrated numerically that the
system is topological for $\lambda <0$, while it is trivial for $\lambda >0$

familiar in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The topological phase transition is
observable by a significant difference between the dynamics of voltages in the
two phases, which is explained by the emergence of the topological edge states.
This is a bulk-edge correspondence in nonlinear systems. The dimerized Toda

unlicensed with licensed LPWANs can overcome these limitations and harness
their benefits. However, a concatenated LPWAN architecture will inevitably
result in excess latency which may impact users' quality-of-experience (QoE).
To evaluate the real-life feasibility of this system, we first propose a

end-to-end (E2E) latencies. The concatenated delay margin is determined by
benchmarking the latencies with different LPWAN architecture schemes, namely
with unlicensed IoT (standalone LoRa), cellular IoT (standalone LTE-M), and
concatenated IoT (LoRa interfaced with LTE-M). Through extensive experimental
measurement campaigns of 30,000 data points of E2E latencies, we show that the
excess delay due to LPWAN interfacing introduces on average less than 300
milliseconds. The proof-of-concept results suggest that the latency for
concatenating unlicensed LPWAN with cellular IoT is negligible for smart city
use cases where human perception and decision making is in the loop.

is well acknowledged that in such applications the underlying chaotic systems
should be carefully chosen. However, the requirements imposed on the chaotic
systems are usually heuristic, without theoretic guarantee for the resultant
communication scheme. Among all the primitives for secure communications, it is
well-accepted that (pseudo) random numbers are most essential. Taking the
well-studied two-dimensional coupled map lattice (2D CML) as an example, this
paper performs a theoretical study towards pseudo-random number generation with
the 2D CML. In so doing, an analytical expression of the Lyapunov exponent (LE)
spectrum of the 2D CML is first derived. Using the LEs, one can configure
system parameters to ensure the 2D CML only exhibits complex dynamic behavior,
and then collect pseudo-random numbers from the system orbits. Moreover, based
on the observation that least significant bit distributes more evenly in the
(pseudo) random distribution, an extraction algorithm E is developed with the
property that, when applied to the orbits of the 2D CML, it can squeeze uniform
bits. In implementation, if fixed-point arithmetic is used in binary format
with a precision of $z$ bits after the radix point, E can ensure that the
deviation of the squeezed bits is bounded by $2^{-z}$ . Further simulation
results demonstrate that the new method not only guide the 2D CML model to
exhibit complex dynamic behavior, but also generate uniformly distributed
independent bits. In particular, the squeezed pseudo random bits can pass both
NIST 800-22 and TestU01 test suites in various settings. This study thereby
provides a theoretical basis for effectively applying the 2D CML to secure
communications.

advantages. First, it is capable of ingesting the labeling information when

handled the Covid-19 pandemic crisis better or worse than authoritarian
countries. However, it is important to consider the issues of democracy versus
authoritarianism, and state fragility, when examining official Covid-19 death
counts in research, because these factors can influence the accurate reporting
of pandemic deaths by governments. In contrast, excess deaths are less prone to
variability in differences in definitions of Covid-19 deaths and testing
capacities across countries. Here we use excess pandemic deaths to explore
potential relationships between political systems and public health outcomes.
  Methods: We address these issues by comparing the official government
Covid-19 death counts in a well-established John Hopkins database to the
generally more reliable excess mortality measure of Covid-19 deaths, taken from
the recently released World Mortality Dataset. We put the comparison in the
context of the political and fragile state dimensions.
  Findings: We find (1) significant potential underreporting of Covid-19 deaths
by authoritarian governments and governments with high state fragility and (2)
substantial geographic variation among countries and regions with regard to
standard democracy indices. Additionally, we find that more authoritarian
governments are (weakly) associated with more excess deaths during the pandemic
than democratic governments.
  Interpretations: The inhibition and censorship of information flows, inherent
to authoritarian states, likely results in major inaccuracies in pandemic
statistics that confound global public health analyses. Thus, both excess
pandemic deaths and official Covid-19 death counts should be examined in
studies using death as an outcome variable.

recommendations fitting their current preferences by handling dynamic user
preferences over time. Previous studies have focused on modeling sequential
dynamics without much regard to which of the best-selling products (i.e., head
items) or niche products (i.e., tail items) should be recommended. We
scrutinize the structural reason for why tail items are barely served in the
current sequential recommendation model, which consists of an item-embedding
layer, a sequence-modeling layer, and a recommendation layer. Well-designed
sequence-modeling and recommendation layers are expected to naturally learn
suitable item embeddings. However, tail items are likely to fall short of this
expectation because the current model structure is not suitable for learning
high-quality embeddings with insufficient data. Thus, tail items are rarely
recommended. To eliminate this issue, we propose a framework called CITIES,
which aims to enhance the quality of the tail-item embeddings by training an
embedding-inference function using multiple contextual head items so that the
recommendation performance improves for not only the tail items but also for
the head items. Moreover, our framework can infer new-item embeddings without
an additional learning process. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets show that applying CITIES to the state-of-the-art methods improves
recommendation performance for both tail and head items. We conduct an
additional experiment to verify that CITIES can infer suitable new-item

to individuals' reputation and security. To mitigate these threats, recent
studies have proposed adversarial watermarks to combat deepfake models, leading
them to generate distorted outputs. Despite achieving impressive results, these
adversarial watermarks have low image-level and model-level transferability,
meaning that they can protect only one facial image from one specific deepfake
model. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution that can generate a
Cross-Model Universal Adversarial Watermark (CMUA-Watermark), protecting a
large number of facial images from multiple deepfake models. Specifically, we
begin by proposing a cross-model universal attack pipeline that attacks
multiple deepfake models iteratively. Then, we design a two-level perturbation
fusion strategy to alleviate the conflict between the adversarial watermarks
generated by different facial images and models. Moreover, we address the key
problem in cross-model optimization with a heuristic approach to automatically
find the suitable attack step sizes for different models, further weakening the
model-level conflict. Finally, we introduce a more reasonable and comprehensive
evaluation method to fully test the proposed method and compare it with
existing ones. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
CMUA-Watermark can effectively distort the fake facial images generated by
multiple deepfake models while achieving a better performance than existing

parameter $H_0$, with some analyses suggesting a tension with early-type probes

to the mass modelling of lens galaxies. In particular, a core component in the
lens density profile would form an approximate local mass sheet degeneracy and
could bias $H_0$ in the right direction to solve the lensing tension. We
consider ultralight dark matter as a possible mechanism to generate such
galactic cores. We show that cores of roughly the required properties could
arise naturally if an ultralight axion of mass $m\sim10^{-25}$ eV makes up a
fraction of order ten percent of the total cosmological dark matter density. A
relic abundance of this order of magnitude could come from vacuum misalignment.
Stellar kinematics measurements of well-resolved massive galaxies (including
the Milky Way) may offer a way to test the scenario. Kinematics analyses aiming
to test the core hypothesis in massive elliptical lens galaxies should not, in
general, adopt the perfect mass sheet limit, as ignoring the finite extent of
an actual physical core could lead to significant systematic errors.

focuses on PPML using word-wise fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). In order to
implement deep learning on word-wise homomorphic encryption (HE), the ReLU and
max-pooling functions should be approximated by some polynomials for
homomorphic operations. Most of the previous studies focus on HE-friendly
networks, where the ReLU and max-pooling functions are approximated using
low-degree polynomials. However, for the classification of the CIFAR-10

model and training. In addition, this approximation by low-degree polynomials
cannot support deeper neural networks due to large approximation errors. Thus,
we propose a precise polynomial approximation technique for the ReLU and
max-pooling functions. Precise approximation using a single polynomial requires
an exponentially high-degree polynomial, which results in a significant number
of non-scalar multiplications. Thus, we propose a method to approximate the
ReLU and max-pooling functions accurately using a composition of minimax
approximate polynomials of small degrees. If we replace the ReLU and
max-pooling functions with the proposed approximate polynomials, well-studied
deep learning models such as ResNet and VGGNet can still be used without

without retraining. We approximate the ReLU and max-pooling functions in the
ResNet-152 using the composition of minimax approximate polynomials of degrees
15, 27, and 29. Then, we succeed in classifying the plaintext ImageNet dataset

$\gamma{d}${$\to$}$\pi^0\eta{d}$ reaction at incident photon energies ranging
from the reaction threshold to 1.15 GeV. A strong enhancement is observed near
the $\eta d$ threshold over the three-body phase-space contribution in the
$\eta d$ invariant-mass distribution. An analysis incorporating the known
isovector resonance $\mathcal{D}_{12}$ with a spin-parity of $2^+$ in the
$\pi^0d$ channel reveals the existence of a narrow isoscalar resonance-like
structure with $1^-$ in the $\eta d$ system. Using a Flatt\'e parametrization,
the mass is found to be $2.427_{-0.006}^{+0.013}$ GeV, close to the $\eta d$
threshold, and the width is $\left(0.029_{-0.029}^{+0.006}{\rm\

the $\eta$ momentum in the rest frame of the $\eta d$ system. The observed

state from $\eta NN$ and $\pi NN$ coupled-channel calculation, or an $\eta d$
virtual state owing to strong $\eta d$ attraction.

Automatic spatial and temporal differentiation is applied to the partial

possibility to understand which predictors affect air pollution in which
functional form; and are not able to regress on exceedances over certain
thresholds imposed by authorities directly. The latter naturally induce
conditional quantiles and reflect the seriousness of particular events. In the
present paper we focus on this important aspect by developing quantile
regression models further. We propose a general Bayesian effect selection
approach for additive quantile regression within a highly interpretable
framework. We place separate normal beta prime spike and slab priors on the
scalar importance parameters of effect parts and implement a fast Gibbs
sampling scheme. Specifically, it enables to study quantile-specific covariate
effects, allows these covariates to be of general functional form using
additive predictors, and facilitates the analysts' decision whether an effect
should be included linearly, non-linearly or not at all in the quantiles of
interest. In a detailed analysis on air pollution data in Madrid (Spain) we
find the added value of modelling extreme nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations
and how thresholds are driven differently by several climatological variables
and traffic as a spatial proxy. Our results underpin the need of enhanced
statistical models to support short-term decisions and enable local authorities
to mitigate or even prevent exceedances of NO2 concentration limits.

investigate the reporting of three potentially influential elements of data
quality in ESE studies: data collection, data pre-processing, and the
identification of data quality issues. This enables us to establish how
researchers view the topic of data quality and the mechanisms that are being
used to address it. Greater awareness of data quality should inform both the
sound conduct of ESE research and the robust practice of ESE data collection
and processing. Method: We performed a targeted literature review of empirical
software engineering studies covering the period January 2007 to September
2012. A total of 221 relevant studies met our inclusion criteria and were
characterized in terms of their consideration and treatment of data quality.
Results: We obtained useful insights as to how the ESE community considers

all three elements of data quality considered in this paper. Conclusion: The
reporting of data collection procedures is not documented consistently in ESE
studies. It will be useful if data collection challenges are reported in order
to improve our understanding of why there are problems with software
engineering data sets and the models developed from them. More generally, data
quality should be given far greater attention by the community. The improvement
of data sets through enhanced data collection, pre-processing and quality
assessment should lead to more reliable prediction models, thus improving the

generalize the tools that have been so efficient in understanding, classifying
and reasoning about word languages. In particular, we introduce an asynchronous
version of the wreath product operation and we describe the trace languages
recognized by such products (the so-called asynchronous wreath product
principle). We then propose a decomposition result for recognizable trace
languages, analogous to the Krohn-Rhodes theorem, and we prove this
decomposition result in the special case of acyclic architectures. Finally, we
introduce and analyze two distributed automata-theoretic operations. One, the
local cascade product, is a direct implementation of the asynchronous wreath
product operation. The other, global cascade sequences, although conceptually
and operationally similar to the local cascade product, translates to a more
complex asynchronous implementation which uses the gossip automaton of Mukund
and Sohoni. This leads to interesting applications to the characterization of
trace languages definable in first-order logic: they are accepted by a
restricted local cascade product of the gossip automaton and 2-state
asynchronous reset automata, and also by a global cascade sequence of 2-state
asynchronous reset automata. Over distributed alphabets for which the
asynchronous Krohn-Rhodes theorem holds, a local cascade product of such
automata is sufficient and this, in turn, leads to the identification of a
simple temporal logic which is expressively complete for such alphabets.

a Multi-input-Single-output (MISO) identification problem that requires
identification of a parametric model for all the modules constituting the MISO
setup including (possibly) the noise model, and determine their model order.
This requirement leads to model order selection steps for modules that are of
no interest to the experimenter which increases the computational complexity
for large-sized networks. Also, identification using a parametric noise model
(like BJ method) can suffer from local minima, however neglecting the noise
model has its impact on the variance of the estimates. In this paper, we
provide a two-step identification approach to avoid these problems. The first
step involves performing a non-parametric indirect approach for a MISO
identification problem to get the non-parametric frequency response function
(FRF) estimates and its variance as a function of frequency. In the second
step, the estimated non-parametric FRF of the target module is smoothed using a
parametric frequency domain estimator with the estimated variance from the
previous step as the non-parametric noise model. The developed approach is
practical with weak assumptions on noise, uses the available toolbox, requires
a parametric model only for the target module of interest, and uses a
non-parametric noise model to reduce the variance of the estimates. Numerical
simulations illustrate the potentials of the introduced method in comparison

and human-computer interaction applications. Predicting the 3D hand pose from a
single RGB image is challenging due to occlusion and depth ambiguities.
GCN-based (Graph Convolutional Networks) methods exploit the structural
relationship similarity between graphs and hand joints to model kinematic
dependencies between joints. These techniques use predefined or globally
learned joint relationships, which may fail to capture pose-dependent
constraints. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage GCN-based
framework that learns per-pose relationship constraints. Specifically, the
first phase quantizes the 2D/3D space to classify the joints into 2D/3D blocks
based on their locality. This spatial dependency information guides this phase
to estimate reliable 2D and 3D poses. The second stage further improves the 3D
estimation through a GCN-based module that uses an adaptative nearest neighbor
algorithm to determine joint relationships. Extensive experiments show that our
multi-stage GCN approach yields an efficient model that produces accurate 2D/3D
hand poses and outperforms the state-of-the-art on two public datasets.

performance of modern natural language processing tasks, ranging from text
classification to text generation. This allows corporations to provide machine
learning as a service (MLaaS) by encapsulating fine-tuned BERT-based models as
APIs. However, BERT-based APIs have exhibited a series of security and privacy
vulnerabilities. For example, prior work has exploited the security issues of
the BERT-based APIs through the adversarial examples crafted by the extracted
model. However, the privacy leakage problems of the BERT-based APIs through the
extracted model have not been well studied. On the other hand, due to the high
capacity of BERT-based APIs, the fine-tuned model is easy to be overlearned,
but what kind of information can be leaked from the extracted model remains
unknown. In this work, we bridge this gap by first presenting an effective
model extraction attack, where the adversary can practically steal a BERT-based
API (the target/victim model) by only querying a limited number of queries. We
further develop an effective attribute inference attack which can infer the
sensitive attribute of the training data used by the BERT-based APIs. Our
extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various realistic settings
validate the potential vulnerabilities of BERT-based APIs. Moreover, we
demonstrate that two promising defense methods become ineffective against our

pronounced when the leads are strongly confined low dimensional systems, such
as in a nanowire (NW) where transport is one-dimensional and quasi-zero
dimensional lead-states can emerge. In this paper we study such lead-states in
InAs NWs. We use a QD integrated directly into the NW during the epitaxial
growth as an energetically and spatially well-defined tunnel probe to perform
$dI/dV$ spectroscopy of discrete bound states in the `left' and `right' NW lead
segments. By tuning a sidegate in close proximity of one lead segment, we can
distinguish transport features related to the modulation in the lead DOS and to
excited states in the QD. We implement a non-interacting capacitance model and
derive expressions for the slopes of QD and lead resonances that appear in
two-dimensional plots of $dI/dV$ as a function of source-drain bias and gate
voltage in terms of the different lever arms determined by the capacitive
couplings. We discuss how the interplay between the lever arms affect the
slopes. We verify our model by numerically calculating the $dI/dV$ using a
resonant tunneling model with three non-interacting quantum dots in series.
Finally, we used the model to describe the measured $dI/dV$ spectra and extract

making the selection of appropriate learning rates challenging. The sampling
errors can manifest either as a bias or variances in a line search. Dynamic
MBSS re-samples a mini-batch at every function evaluation. Hence, dynamic MBSS
results in point-wise discontinuous loss functions with smaller bias but larger
variance than static sampled loss functions. However, dynamic MBSS has the
advantage of having larger data throughput during training but requires the
complexity regarding discontinuities to be resolved. This study extends the
gradient-only surrogate (GOS), a line search method using quadratic
approximation models built with only directional derivative information, for
dynamic MBSS loss functions. We propose a gradient-only approximation line
search (GOALS) with strong convergence characteristics with defined optimality
criterion. We investigate GOALS's performance by applying it on various
optimizers that include SGD, RMSprop and Adam on ResNet-18 and EfficientNetB0.
We also compare GOALS's against the other existing learning rate methods. We
quantify both the best performing and most robust algorithms. For the latter,
we introduce a relative robust criterion that allows us to quantify the
difference between an algorithm and the best performing algorithm for a given

pre-processing and post-processing operations or user guidance that require
domain-specific knowledge.
  Methods: In this paper, we propose a convolution in transformer (COTR)
network for end-to-end polyp detection. Motivated by the detection transformer
(DETR), COTR is constituted by a CNN for feature extraction, transformer
encoder layers interleaved with convolutional layers for feature encoding and
recalibration, transformer decoder layers for object querying, and a
feed-forward network for detection prediction. Considering the slow convergence
of DETR, COTR embeds convolution layers into transformer encoder for feature
reconstruction and convergence acceleration.
  Results: Experimental results on two public polyp datasets show that COTR
achieved 91.49\% precision, 82.69% sensitivity, and 86.87% F1-score on the
ETIS-LARIB, and 91.67% precision, 93.54% sensitivity, and 92.60% F1-score on
the CVC-ColonDB.
  Conclusion: This study proposed an end to end detection method based on
detection transformer for colorectal polyp detection. Experimental results on
ETIS-LARIB and CVC-ColonDB dataset demonstrated that the proposed model
achieved comparable performance against state-of-the-art methods.

integrating larger context into convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This
indicates that global scene context is essential, despite the seemingly
bottom-up nature of the problem. This may be explained by the fact that context
knowledge can adapt and improve local feature extraction to a given scene. In
this paper, we therefore investigate the role of global context for crowd
counting. Specifically, a pure transformer is used to extract features with
global information from overlapping image patches. Inspired by classification,
we add a context token to the input sequence, to facilitate information
exchange with tokens corresponding to image patches throughout transformer
layers. Due to the fact that transformers do not explicitly model the
tried-and-true channel-wise interactions, we propose a token-attention module
(TAM) to recalibrate encoded features through channel-wise attention informed
by the context token. Beyond that, it is adopted to predict the total person
count of the image through regression-token module (RTM). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various

large-scale JHU-CROWD++ dataset, our method improves over the previous best

valley interference and dopant placement on the Heisenberg spin exchange

by engineering in-plane dopant placement along specific crystallographic
directions. A vacuum-like behaviour is recovered, where the exchange is
maximised to the overlap between the donor orbitals, and pair-to-pair
variations limited to a factor of less than 10 considering the accuracy in
dopant positioning. This robustness remains over a large range of distances,

proposed. Such a framework has emerged from the study of relativistic dynamics
of fluids out of equilibrium in a curved background and is characterised by the
presence of deviations from the equilibrium pressure in the energy-momentum
tensor which are due to linear terms in the Ricci scalar and the Ricci tensor.
The coefficients in front of such terms are called the second order transport
coefficients and they parametrise the fluid response to the pressure terms
arising from the spacetime curvature.
  Under the preliminary assumption that the second order transport coefficients
are constant, we find the simplest solution of Ricci cosmology in which the
presence of pressure terms causes a departure from the perfect fluid redshift
scaling for matter components filling the Universe. In order to test the
viability of this solution, we make four different ans\""{a}tze on the transport
coefficients, giving rise to four different cases of our model. On the physical
ground of the second law of thermodynamics for fluids with non-equilibrium

models. Our main concern is then the check of each of the case against the
standard set of cosmological data in order to obtain the observational bounds
on the second order transport coefficients. We find those bounds also realising
that Ricci cosmology model is compatible with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology for all

W^{1,p}-functions on randomly perforated domains, where the geometry is assumed
to be stationary ergodic. Such extension and trace operators are important for
compactness in stochastic homogenization. In contrast to former approaches and
results, we use very weak assumptions on the geometry which we call local
(\delta,M)-regularity, isotropic cone mixing and bounded average connectivity.
The first concept measures local Lipschitz regularity of the domain while the
second measures the mesoscopic distribution of void space. The third is the
most tricky part and measures the ""mesoscopic"" connectivity of the geometry.
  In contrast to former approaches we do not require a minimal distance between
the inclusions and we allow for globally unbounded Lipschitz constants and
percolating holes. We will illustrate our method by applying it to the Boolean
model based on a Poisson point process and to a Delaunay pipe process.

two boundary conditions in each formalism. The Maxwell equations are then
solved analytically in pure anti-de Sitter spacetimes with a global monopole,

field-effect transistors involving SrTiO$_3$ (STO) based two-dimensional
electron gases. Such peculiar behavior is associated with the electron trapping
under an external electric field. However, the microscopic nature of trapping
centers remains an open question. In this paper, we investigate electric
field-induced charge trapping/detrapping phenomena at the conducting interface
between band insulators $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ and STO. Our transport
measurements reveal that the charge trapping under +ve back gate voltage
($V_g$) above the tetragonal to cubic structural transition temperature ($T_c$)
of STO is contributed by the electric field-assisted thermal escape of
electrons from the quantum well, and the clustering of oxygen vacancies (OVs)
as well. We observe an additional source of trapping below the $T_c$, which
arises from the trapping of free carriers at the ferroelastic twin walls of
STO. Application of -ve $V_g$ results in a charge detrapping, which vanishes
above $T_c$ also. This feature demonstrates the crucial role of structural
domain walls in the electrical transport properties of STO based
heterostructures. The number of trapped (detrapped) charges at (from) the twin
wall is controlled by the net polarity of the wall and is completely reversible
with the sweep of $V_g$.

repair actions. To this end, the economic value of distribution system lines
has been considered as a criterion representing the sensitivity of the network
to hurricanes. The modeling is based on value, in which the load value,
lifetime-based failure probability of the poles, fragility curve, duration of
line repair by the maintenance team, and the topology factor have been
considered. This is so that the significance of the demand side, the failure
extent and accessibility of the lines, the importance of time, and the network
configuration are considered. The results provide an order of line priority for
fault resolution, in which the topology factor has a larger effect. This
modeling has been tested on an IEEE 33-bus network.

multivariate polynomial equations is presented. The algorithm is exponential in
complexity, but the well-known algorithms, such as the extended Euclidean
algorithm and Buchberger's algorithm, are superexponential. The
superexponential complexity of the well-known algorithms is due to their not
being ""minimal"" in a certain sense. Buchberger's algorithm produces a Groebner
basis. The proposed original reduction algorithm achieves the required task,
via computation of determinants of parametric Sylvester matrices, and produces
a Rabin basis, which is shown to be minimal, when two multivariate polynomials
are reduced at a time. The minimality of Rabin basis allows us to prove
exponential lower bounds for the space complexity of an algebraic proof of
certification, for a specific computational problem in the computational
complexity class PSPACE, showing that the complexity classes PSPACE and P
cannot be the same. By the same reasoning, it follows that Co-NP is not the
same as either of the complexity classes NP and P, and that the polynomial time
hierarchy does not collapse. It is also shown that the class BPP of languages
decidable by bounded error probabilistic algorithms with (probabilistic)
polynomial time proofs for the membership of input words is not the same as any
one of the complexity classes P, NP and Co-NP. It follows again, from the
discussions, that the complexity classes NP and P are not the same, by
relativization of BPP, with respect to P and NP.

associated with Newtonian point mass approximation of gravity models is removed
using the analytical extensions. The regularized and finite partition function
is obtained for the system of galaxies in the brane world model and is used to
evaluate the regularized thermodynamic properties of the system in the form of

doping. Herein, we used InAs nanocrystals thin films as a model system to
address the relative contributions of these doping mechanisms by comparative
analysis of as-synthesized and Cu-doped nanocrystal based field-effect
transistor (FET) characteristics. By applying FET simulation methods used in
conventional semiconductor FETs, we elucidate surface and impurity-doping
contributions to the overall performance of InAs NCs based FETs. As-synthesized
InAs nanocrystal-based FETs show n-type characteristics assigned to the
contribution of surface electrons accumulation layer that can be considered as
an actual electron donating doping level with specific doping density and is
energetically located just below the conduction band. The Cu-doped InAs NCs
FETs show enhanced n-type conduction as expected from the Cu impurities
location as an interstitial n-dopant in InAs nanocrystals. The simulated curves
reveal the additional contribution from electrons within an impurity sub-band
close to the conduction band onset of the InAs NCs. The work therefore
demonstrates the utility of the bulk FET simulation methodology also to
NC-based FETs. It provides guidelines for control of doping of nanocrystal
arrays separately from surface contributions and impurity doping in colloidal
semiconductor NCs towards their future utilization as building blocks in
bottom-up prepared optoelectronic devices.

itself to create a specific native structure, also called the minimum energy
conformation. It is the native structure that determines the functionality of
each protein. The protein folding problem (PFP) remains one of the more
difficult problems in computational and chemical biology. The principal
challenge of PFP is to predict the optimal conformation of a given protein by
considering only its amino acid sequence. As the conformational space contains
a very large number of conformations, even when addressing short sequences,
different simplified models have been developed and applied to make the PFP
less complex. In the last few years, many computational approaches have been
proposed to solve the PFP. They are based on simplified lattice models such as
the hydrophobic-polar model. In this paper, we present a new Hybrid Cuckoo
Search Algorithm (HCSA) to solve the 3D-HP protein folding optimization
problem. Our proposed algorithm consists of combining the Cuckoo Search
Algorithm (CSA) with the Hill Climbing (HC) algorithm. Simulation results on
different benchmark sequences are presented and compared to the

Suppose that $E=\cup_{i\in I} E_i$ is a partition, where each $E_i$ is
infinite. Suppose also that, in each $E_i$, the number of elements satisfying
$(\bf P)$ is finite. Then, clearly the density of the elements satisfying $(\bf
P)$ is 0 in every $E_i$. Is it possible that the density of the subset of $E$
containing all the elements satisfying $(\bf P)$ will be at least equal to $
1/2$?}
  We were first confronted with this situation while reading the paper of Arno
et al. [1]. In fact, it is in the paper [1] where it is shown that the density
of certain algebraic numbers in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, which we will call
Arno et al. numbers in section 5, is equal to $1/\zeta(3)$. We have partitioned
$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ in a way that suggests these Arno et al. numbers are
rare. This phenomenom struck us as contradictory, which lead us to consider the
situation in greater detail. We will show in the sequel, through two examples,
that the answer to the above question may be positive. At first glance, this
problem resembles to the so called Simpson paradox in probability and
statistics. In this paper, when we say the density, we mean the natural
density.

their likelihood of adoption by marketing scholars. Our paradigm of analysis,
the Transparent Model of Unabridged Data (TMUD), enables researchers to
investigate the inner workings of such black box models by incorporating an ex
ante filtration module and an ex post experimentation module. We empirically
demonstrate the TMUD by investigating the role of facial components and sexual
dimorphism in face perceptions, which have implications for four marketing
contexts: advertisement (perceptions of approachability, trustworthiness, and
competence), brand (perceptions of whether a face represents a brand's typical
customer), category (perceptions of whether a face represents a category's
typical customer), and customer persona (perceptions of whether a face
represents the persona of a brand's customer segment). Our results reveal new
and useful findings that enrich the existing literature on face perception,
most of which is based on abridged attributes (e.g., width of mouth). The TMUD
has great potential to be a useful paradigm for generating theoretical insights
and may encourage more marketing researchers and practitioners to use
unabridged data.

field source and the test body used to measure it at a given point? What does
propagate between two physical bodies when they interact? These are the
fundamental questions we answer in the present work for electromagnetic and
gravitational interactions. We come to the conclusion that gravitational fields
as well as spacetime curvature cannot depend on the passive-gravitational to
inertial mass ratio of the test bodies, because this would lead to energy
conservation and causality violation except when this ratio is universally
exactly equal to one. For what concerns the hypothetical dependence of
electromagnetic fields on the charge to inertial-mass ratio of test bodies,
this would call for the propagation of an operationally ill defined quantity
(Coulomb . Meter$^2$ / Second$^2$) that would replace energy (Joule = Kilogram
. Meter$^2$ / Second$^2$) transfer in the interaction between two electrically
charged bodies. Hence electromagnetic fields cannot depend on the charge to
inertial-mass ratio of test bodies. A consequence of these results is also the
disqualification of Murat Ozer's unification theory of gravitation and
electromagnetism.
