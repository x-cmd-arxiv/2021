increasing availability of geo-spatial open-data, high-resolution satellite

small set of known waste dumping sites in Buenos Aires, and then predict the
location of other sites over vast areas at high speed and low cost. This case

phase-retrieval where the measurements consist of only the magnitude of linear
function of the unknown signal, and the noise in the measurements follow
Poisson distribution. The proposed algorithm is based on the principle of
majorization-minimization (MM); however, the application of MM here is very
novel and distinct from the way MM has been usually used to solve optimization
problems in the literature. More precisely, we reformulate the original
minimization problem into a saddle point problem by invoking Fenchel dual
representation of the log (.) term in the Poisson likelihood function. We then
propose tighter surrogate functions over both primal and dual variables
resulting in a double-loop MM algorithm, which we have named as Primal-Dual
Majorization-Minimization (PDMM) algorithm. The iterative steps of the
resulting algorithm are simple to implement and involve only computing matrix
vector products. We also extend our algorithm to handle various L1 regularized
Poisson phase-retrieval problems (which exploit sparsity). The proposed
algorithm is compared with previously proposed algorithms such as wirtinger
flow (WF), MM (conventional), and alternating direction methods of multipliers
(ADMM) for the Poisson data model. The simulation results under different
experimental settings show that PDMM is faster than the competing methods, and
its performance in recovering the original signal is at par with the
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Physics-guided Deep Markov Model (PgDMM). The framework targets the inference
of the characteristics and latent structure of nonlinear dynamical systems from

intractable. A recently surfaced option pertains to leveraging variational
inference to perform approximate inference. In such a scheme, transition and
emission functions of the system are parameterized via feed-forward neural
networks (deep generative models). However, due to the generalized and highly
versatile formulation of neural network functions, the learned latent space
often lacks physical interpretation and structured representation. To address
this, we bridge physics-based state space models with Deep Markov Models, thus
delivering a hybrid modeling framework for unsupervised learning and
identification of nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed framework takes
advantage of the expressive power of deep learning, while retaining the driving
physics of the dynamical system by imposing physics-driven restrictions on the
side of the latent space. We demonstrate the benefits of such a fusion in terms
of achieving improved performance on illustrative simulation examples and
experimental case studies of nonlinear systems. Our results indicate that the
physics-based models involved in the employed transition and emission functions
essentially enforce a more structured and physically interpretable latent
space, which is essential for enhancing and generalizing the predictive
capabilities of deep learning-based models.

adversarial jamming device. Specifically, if the radar optimally adapts its
waveform based on adversarial target maneuvers (probes), how should the radar
choose its waveform parameters (response) so that its utility function cannot
be recovered by the adversary. This paper abstracts the radar's cognition
masking problem in terms of the spectra (eigenvalues) of the state and
observation noise covariance matrices, and embeds the algebraic Riccati
equation into an economics-based utility maximization setup. Given an observed
sequence of radar responses, the adversary tests for utility maximization
behavior of the radar and estimates its utility function that rationalizes the
radar's responses. In turn, the radar deliberately chooses sub-optimal
responses so that its utility function almost fails the utility maximization
test, and hence, its cognitive ability is masked from the adversary. We
illustrate the performance of our cognition masking scheme via simple numerical
examples. Our approach in this paper is based on revealed preference theory in
microeconomics for identifying rationality.

viable alternatives to traditional Bayer patterns. Despite the substantial
advantages, such non-Bayer CFA patterns are susceptible to produce visual
artefacts while reconstructing RGB images from noisy sensor data. This study
addresses the challenges of learning RGB image reconstruction from noisy
Nona-Bayer CFA comprehensively. We propose a novel spatial-asymmetric attention
module to jointly learn bi-direction transformation and large-kernel global
attention to reduce the visual artefacts. We combine our proposed module with
adversarial learning to produce plausible images from Nona-Bayer CFA. The
feasibility of the proposed method has been verified and compared with the
state-of-the-art image reconstruction method. The experiments reveal that the
proposed method can reconstruct RGB images from noisy Nona-Bayer CFA without
producing any visually disturbing artefacts. Also, it can outperform the
state-of-the-art image reconstruction method in both qualitative and

humans but which is highly challenging for autonomous robots to execute due to
the highly deformable nature of textiles; It is hard to engineer and learn
manipulation pipelines to efficiently execute it. In this paper, we propose a
new solution for robotic cloth folding (using a standard folding board) via
learning from demonstrations. Our demonstration video encoding is based on a
high-level abstraction, namely, a refined optical flow-based spatiotemporal
graph, as opposed to a low-level encoding such as image pixels. By constructing
a new spatiotemporal graph with an advanced visual corresponding descriptor,
the policy learning can focus on key points and relations with a 3D spatial
configuration, which allows to quickly generalize across different
environments. To further boost the policy searching, we combine optical flow
and static motion saliency maps to discriminate the dominant motions for better
handling the system dynamics in real-time, which aligns with the attentional
motion mechanism that dominates the human imitation process. To validate the
proposed approach, we analyze the manual folding procedure and developed a
custom-made end-effector to efficiently interact with the folding board.
Multiple experiments on a real robotic platform were conducted to validate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

nervous system (ANS) is well documented in scientific literature. Heart rate
variability (HRV) is a rich source of information for studying the dynamics of
this relation. Disturbed heart dynamics in depression seriously increases
mortality risk. Technical sciences help improve early detection and monitoring
and offer more accurate management of treatment. Based on advances in
computational power, information theory, complex systems dynamics, and
nonlinear analysis applied to physiological complexity, we can now turn to
novel biomarkers extracted from electrophysiological signals. This work is a
cross-sectional analysis with methodological commentary of application of
nonlinear measures of HRV related to depression. Methods: We systematically
searched online for papers exploring the connection of depression and HRV,
using both conventional and nonlinear analysis. We scrutinized chosen
publications and methodologically analyzed and compared them. Results:
Sixty-seven publications on the connection of HRV measures and depression
meeting our inclusion criteria are selected. The effectiveness of the applied
methods of electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis are compared and discussed in the
light of detection and prevention of depression-related cardiac diseases.
Conclusions: It is clear that aberrated ANS dynamics can be detected via ECG
analysis, where nonlinear measures show to be more sensitive and accurate than
standard time and spectral ones. With the portable ECG devices and cloud-based
telehealth applications, monitoring of outpatients could be done anytime
anywhere. We appeal for early screening for cardiovascular abnormalities in
depressive patients to prevent possible deleterious events.

companies, broader practical adoption of such large models among domain

selection needs further compound these resource challenges: users often need to
compare dozens of models with different hyper-parameters or neural
architectures to suit their specific task and dataset. In this paper, we
present Hydra, a system designed to tackle such challenges by enabling
out-of-the-box scaling for multi-large-model DL workloads on even commodity
GPUs in a resource-efficient manner. Hydra is the first approach to
holistically optimize the execution of multi-model workloads for large DL
models. We do this by adapting prior ""model-parallel"" execution schemes to work
with scalable parameter offloading across the memory hierarchy and further
hybridizing this approach with task-parallel job scheduling techniques. Hydra
decouples scalability of model parameters from parallelism of execution, thus
enabling DL users to train even a 6-billion parameter model on a single
commodity GPU. It also fully exploits the speedup potential of task parallelism
in multi-GPU setups, yielding near-linear strong scaling and making rigorous
model selection perhaps more practical for such models. We evaluate end-to-end
performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 for language modeling. We find that Hydra
offers between 50% and 100% higher training throughput than even the best
settings of state-of-the-art industrial frameworks such as DeepSpeed and GPipe

First, we characterize data augmentation theoretically as an instance of
vicinal risk minimization, which aims at improving risk estimates during
training by replacing the delta functions that define the empirical density
over the input space with an approximation of the marginal population density
in the vicinity of the training samples. More specifically, we assume that
local neighborhoods centered at training samples can be approximated using a
mixture of Gaussians, and demonstrate theoretically that this can incorporate
robust inductive bias into the learning process. We then specify the individual
mixture components implicitly via data augmentation schemes, designed to
address common sources of spurious correlations in acoustic models. To avoid
potential confounding effects on robustness due to information loss, which has
been associated with standard feature extraction techniques (e.g., FBANK and
MFCC features), we focus on the waveform-based setting. Our empirical results
show that the approach can generalize to unseen noise conditions, with 150%

second is a spatial approach that uses an encoder-decoder framework to regress
an ordered point cloud for the matching alignment from an irregular input.
Unfortunately, the decoder brings considerable disadvantages, as it requires a
large amount of training data and struggles to generalize well in cross-dataset
evaluations. DPC's novelty lies in its lack of a decoder component. Instead, we
use latent similarity and the input coordinates themselves to construct the
point cloud and determine correspondence, replacing the coordinate regression
done by the decoder. Extensive experiments show that our construction scheme

result, there is a need for a method that is not only capable of efficiently
solving the above two problems but also robust enough to solve a variety of
tasks. To this end, we propose a new multi-agent policy gradient method, called
Robust Local Advantage (ROLA) Actor-Critic. ROLA allows each agent to learn an
individual action-value function as a local critic as well as ameliorating
environment non-stationarity via a novel centralized training approach based on
a centralized critic. By using this local critic, each agent calculates a
baseline to reduce variance on its policy gradient estimation, which results in
an expected advantage action-value over other agents' choices that implicitly
improves credit assignment. We evaluate ROLA across diverse benchmarks and show
its robustness and effectiveness over a number of state-of-the-art multi-agent
policy gradient algorithms.

solar limb of the PSP spacecraft. We used a subarray of the Giant Ukrainian

frequency range of 8-80 MHz, as well as the PSP radio instruments with a
bandwidth of 10.5 kHz - 19.2 MHz, during solar observations on June 5, 2020. We
directly detected the radio events initiated by the active region behind the
solar limb of the PSP spacecraft, using special conditions in the solar corona,
due to the absence of active regions from the PSP side. Following the
generation mechanism of solar radio emission, we refined the density model for
the solar corona above the active region 12765 responsible for the radio
bursts. Based on the PSP spacecraft position near the Sun and delays of radio
waves between space- and ground-based records, we found the corresponding radio
responses on the PSP spectrogram. The absence of sunspots from the PSP side
contributes to the propagation of radio waves from a dense loop of the Sun to
quiet regions with low densities, through which PSP instruments can detect the
radiation.

the conditional odds-ratio from the mean and variance of predicted risks. Brief

observed data that can often be modeled as the natural symmetries that manifest
themselves through invariances and equivariances to certain transformation
laws. However, current approaches to representing these symmetries are couched
in the formalism of continuous normalizing flows that require the construction
of equivariant vector fields -- inhibiting their simple application to
conventional higher dimensional generative modelling domains like natural

discrete layers. We first theoretically prove the existence of an equivariant

introduce three new equivariant flows: $G$-Residual Flows, $G$-Coupling Flows,
and $G$-Inverse Autoregressive Flows that elevate classical Residual, Coupling,
and Inverse Autoregressive Flows with equivariant maps to a prescribed group
$G$. Our construction of $G$-Residual Flows are also universal, in the sense
that we prove an $G$-equivariant diffeomorphism can be exactly mapped by a
$G$-residual flow. Finally, we complement our theoretical insights with
demonstrative experiments -- for the first time -- on image datasets like
CIFAR-10 and show $G$-Equivariant Finite Normalizing flows lead to increased
data efficiency, faster convergence, and improved likelihood estimates.

mid-M type ($T_{eff}\approx$3100K) dwarf with a position, space motion, and
color-magnitude that support Taurus membership, and possible affiliation with a
$\sim$2.5 Myr-old sub-group. A comparison with stellar models suggests a 2-5
Myr age and a mass of 0.15-0.18M$_{\odot}$. Although K2 detected quasi-periodic
dimming from close-in circumstellar dust, the star lacks detectable excess
infrared emission from a circumstellar disk and its H$\alpha$ emission is not
commensurate with accretion. Astrometry based on three years of AO imaging
shows that the companion (2M0437b) is co-moving, while photometry of two other
sources at larger separation indicates they are likely heavily-reddened
background stars. A comparison of the luminosity of 2M0437b with models
suggests a mass of 3-5$M_{\rm jup}$, well below the deuterium burning limit,
and an effective temperature of 1400-1500K, characteristic of a late L spectral
type. The $H$-$K$ color is redder than the typical L dwarf, but comparable to
other directly detected young planets, e.g. those around HR 8799. The discovery
of a super-Jupiter around a very young, very low mass star challenges models of
planet formation by either core accretion (which requires time) or disk
instability (which requires mass). We also detected a second, co-moving,
widely-separated (75"") object which appears to be a heavily-extincted star.
This is certainly a fellow member of this Taurus sub-group and statistically
likely to be a bound companion.

challenging task that requires a lot of resources and time. This is especially
true when features in the environment are spatiotemporally changing with

evolve in a low-dimensional space, making it possible to capture their dynamics
sufficiently well with only one or several properly planned mobile sensors.
This paper investigates the problem of dynamic compressed sensing of an
unsteady flow field, which takes advantage of the inherently low dimensionality
of the underlying flow dynamics to reduce number of waypoints for a mobile
sensing robot. The optimal sensing waypoints are identified by an iterative
compressed sensing algorithm that optimizes the flow reconstruction based on
the proper orthogonal decomposition modes. An optimal sampling trajectory is
then found to traverse these waypoints while minimizing the energy consumption,
time, and flow reconstruction error. Simulation results in an unsteady double

algorithms. Experimental results with an indoor quadcopter are presented to

computers (QCs). In the era of quantum computing, Shor's algorithm running on
QCs can break asymmetric encryption algorithms that classical computers
practically cannot. Though the exact date when QCs will become ""dangerous"" for
practical problems is unknown, the consensus is that this future is near. Thus,
the software engineering community needs to start making software ready for
quantum attacks and ensure quantum safety proactively.
  We argue that the problem of evolving existing software to quantum-safe
software is very similar to the Y2K bug. Thus, we leverage some best practices
from the Y2K bug and propose our roadmap, called 7E, which gives developers a
structured way to prepare for quantum attacks. It is intended to help
developers start planning for the creation of new software and the evolution of
cryptography in existing software.
  In this paper, we use a case study to validate the viability of 7E. Our
software under study is the IBM Db2 database system. We upgrade the current
cryptographic schemes to post-quantum cryptographic ones (using Kyber and
Dilithium schemes) and report our findings and lessons learned.
  We show that the 7E roadmap effectively plans the evolution of existing
software security features towards quantum safety, but it does require minor
revisions. We incorporate our experience with IBM Db2 into the revised 7E
roadmap.
  The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and
Technology is finalizing the post-quantum cryptographic standard. The software
engineering community needs to start getting prepared for the quantum advantage
era. We hope that our experiential study with IBM Db2 and the 7E roadmap will
help the community prepare existing software for quantum attacks in a
structured manner.

Regression Trees (DCART) estimator from Donoho (1997) for (fixed design)

a fast dynamic programming based algorithm with computational complexity $O(N
\log N)$ exists for computing the QDCART estimator and b) an oracle risk bound
(trading off squared error and a complexity parameter of the true signal) holds
for the QDCART estimator. This oracle risk bound then allows us to demonstrate
that the QDCART estimator enjoys adaptively rate optimal estimation guarantees
for piecewise constant and bounded variation function classes. In contrast to
existing results for the DCART estimator which requires subgaussianity of the
error distribution, for our estimation guarantees to hold we do not need any
restrictive tail decay assumptions on the error distribution. For instance, our
results hold even when the error distribution has no first moment such as the
Cauchy distribution. Apart from the Dyadic CART method, we also consider other
variant methods such as the Optimal Regression Tree (ORT) estimator introduced
in Chatterjee and Goswami (2019). In particular, we also extend the ORT

usually the stable end-point of tidal despinning. Saturn's moon Hyperion is a
notable exception by having a chaotic rotation. Hyperion's dynamical state is a
consequence of its high eccentricity and its highly prolate shape (Wisdom et
al. 1984). As many binary asteroids also have elongated secondaries, chaotic
rotation is expected for moons in eccentric binaries (\'Cuk and Nesvorn\'y,
2010), and a minority of asteroidal secondaries may be in that state (Pravec et
al. 2016). The question of secondary rotation is also important for the action
of the BYORP effect, which can quickly evolve orbits of synchronous (but not
non-synchronous) secondaries (\'Cuk and Burns, 2005). Here we report results of
a large set of short numerical simulations which indicate that, apart from
synchronous and classic chaotic rotation, close-in irregularly-shaped
asteroidal secondaries can occupy an additional, intermediate rotational state.
In this ``barrel instability'' the secondary slowly rolls along its long axis,
while the longest axis is staying largely aligned with the primary-secondary
line. This behavior may be more difficult to detect through lightcurves than a
fully chaotic rotation, but would likewise shut down BYORP. We show that the
binary's eccentricity, separation measured in secondary's radii and the
secondary's shape are all important for determining whether the system settles
in synchronous rotation, chaotic tumbling, or barrel instability. We compare
our results for synthetic asteroids with known binary pairs to determine which
of these behaviors may be present in the Near-Earth Asteroid binary population.

evaluation datasets were built using two oversimplifying design choices. First,
the usual identity selection to form imposter pairs is not challenging enough
because, in practice, verification is needed to detect challenging imposters.
Second, the underlying demographics of existing datasets are often insufficient
to account for the wide diversity of facial characteristics of people from
across the world. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the $FaVCI2D$
dataset. Imposter pairs are challenging because they include visually similar
faces selected from a large pool of demographically diversified identities. The
dataset also includes metadata related to gender, country and age to facilitate
fine-grained analysis of results. $FaVCI2D$ is generated from freely
distributable resources. Experiments with state-of-the-art deep models that
provide nearly 100\% performance on existing datasets show a significant

tissue by monitoring tissue deformation due to internal or external forces.
Tissue deformations are estimated from ultrasound radio frequency (RF) signals
and are often referred to as time delay estimation (TDE). Given two RF frames
I1 and I2, we can compute a displacement image which shows the change in the
position of each sample in I1 to a new position in I2. Two important challenges
in TDE include high computational complexity and the difficulty in choosing
suitable RF frames. Selecting suitable frames is of high importance because
many pairs of RF frames either do not have acceptable deformation for
extracting informative strain images or are decorrelated and deformation cannot
be reliably estimated. Herein, we introduce a method that learns 12
displacement modes in quasi-static elastography by performing Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) on displacement fields of a large training database.
In the inference stage, we use dynamic programming (DP) to compute an initial
displacement estimate of around 1% of the samples, and then decompose this
sparse displacement into a linear combination of the 12 displacement modes. Our
method assumes that the displacement of the whole image could also be described
by this linear combination of principal components. We then use the GLobal
Ultrasound Elastography (GLUE) method to fine-tune the result yielding the
exact displacement image. Our method, which we call PCA-GLUE, is more than 10
times faster than DP in calculating the initial displacement map while giving
the same result. Our second contribution in this paper is determining the
suitability of the frame pair I1 and I2 for strain estimation, which we achieve
by using the weight vector that we calculated for PCA-GLUE as an input to a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier.

MCS learning framework leveraging on blockchain technology and the new concept
of edge intelligence based on federated learning (FL), which involves four
major entities, including requestors, blockchain, edge servers and mobile

MCS and blockchain-based FL, they cannot solve the essential challenges of MCS
with respect to accommodating resource-constrained requestors or deal with the
privacy concerns brought by the involvement of requestors and workers in the

payment settlement and allocation, are designed to address major challenges
brought by both internal and external threats, such as malicious edge servers

the employment of an l2 term to achieve strong convexity on top of the target

over-regularization by iteratively realizing target regularization through
appropriately designed augmented data and delivering strong convexity via a
single adaptively weighted dual-purpose l2 regularizer. When the target
regularization is for variable selection, we propose a new regularizer that
achieves both privacy and sparsity guarantees simultaneously. Finally, we
propose a strategy to retrieve privacy budget when the strong convexity
requirement is met, which can be returned to users such that the DP of ERM is
guaranteed at a lower privacy cost than originally planned, or be recycled to
the ERM optimization procedure to reduce the injected DP noise and improve the
utility of DP-ERM. From an implementation perspective, NAPP-ERM can be achieved
by optimizing a non-perturbed object function given noise-augmented data and
can thus leverage existing tools for non-private ERM optimization. We
illustrate through extensive experiments the mitigation effect of the

which achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. It has been observed that for many
applications, those attention heads learn redundant embedding, and most of them
can be removed without degrading the performance of the model. Inspired by this
observation, we propose Transformer with a Mixture of Gaussian Keys
(Transformer-MGK), a novel transformer architecture that replaces redundant
heads in transformers with a mixture of keys at each head. These mixtures of
keys follow a Gaussian mixture model and allow each attention head to focus on
different parts of the input sequence efficiently. Compared to its conventional
transformer counterpart, Transformer-MGK accelerates training and inference,
has fewer parameters, and requires fewer FLOPs to compute while achieving
comparable or better accuracy across tasks. Transformer-MGK can also be easily
extended to use with linear attention. We empirically demonstrate the advantage
of Transformer-MGK in a range of practical applications, including language
modeling and tasks that involve very long sequences. On the Wikitext-103 and
Long Range Arena benchmark, Transformer-MGKs with 4 heads attain comparable or
better performance to the baseline transformers with 8 heads.

computer vision systems are based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (deep
CNN) architectures. However, the high computational resource to run a CNN
algorithm is demanding. Therefore, the methods to speed up computation have
become a relevant research issue. Even though several works on architecture
reduction found in the literature have not yet been achieved satisfactory
results for embedded real-time system applications. This paper presents an
alternative approach based on the Multilinear Feature Space (MFS) method
resorting to transfer learning from large CNN architectures. The proposed
method uses CNNs to generate feature maps, although it does not work as
complexity reduction approach. After the training process, the generated
features maps are used to create vector feature space. We use this new vector
space to make projections of any new sample to classify them. Our method, named
AMFC, uses the transfer learning from pre-trained CNN to reduce the
classification time of new sample image, with minimal accuracy loss. Our method
uses the VGG-16 model as the base CNN architecture for experiments; however,
the method works with any similar CNN model. Using the well-known Vehicle Image
Database and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark, we compared the
classification time of the original VGG-16 model with the AMFC method, and our
method is, on average, 17 times faster. The fast classification time reduces
the computational and memory demands in embedded applications requiring a large
CNN architecture.

The imbalanced distribution will cause misclassification of nodes in the

on the performances of GNNs and proposes new methodologies to solve it. First,
a node-level index, namely, the label difference index ($LDI$), is defined to

to polarization rotation which is facilitated by the presence of various
crystal symmetries for compositions near a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB).
Relaxor-ferroelectric thin films, which are necessary for low-voltage
applications, suffer a reduction in their piezoelectric response due to
clamping by the passive substrate. To understand the microscopic behavior of
this adverse phenomenon, we employ AC electric field driven in-operando
synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) on patterned device structures to
investigate the piezoelectric domain behavior under an electric field for both
a clamped (001) PMN-PT thin film on Si and a (001) PMN-PT membrane released
from its substrate. In the clamped film, the substrate inhibits the field
induced rhombohedral (R) to tetragonal (T) phase transition resulting in a
reversible R to Monoclinic (M) transition with a reduced longitudinal
piezoelectric coefficient d33 < 100 pm/V. Releasing the film from the substrate
results in recovery of the R to T transition and results in a d33 > 1000 pm/V.
Using diffraction with spatial mapping, we find that lateral constraints
imposed by the boundary between active and inactive material also inhibits the
R to T transition. Phase-field calculations on both clamped and released PMN-PT
thin films simulate our experimental findings. Resolving the suppression of
thin film piezoelectric response is critical to their application in

collapse and node split operations of the QED and TED metrics. We demonstrate

goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy in an unknown Markov Decision
Process (MDP) using the data coming from a policy $\mu$. In particular, we
consider the sample complexity problems of offline RL for finite-horizon MDPs.
Prior works study this problem based on different data-coverage assumptions,
and their learning guarantees are expressed by the covering coefficients which
lack the explicit characterization of system quantities. In this work, we
analyze the Adaptive Pessimistic Value Iteration (APVI) algorithm and derive
the suboptimality upper bound that nearly matches \[
O\left(\sum_{h=1}^H\sum_{s_h,a_h}d^{\pi^\star}_h(s_h,a_h)\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{Var}_{P_{s_h,a_h}}{(V^\star_{h+1}+r_h)}}{d^\mu_h(s_h,a_h)}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}}\right).
\] In complementary, we also prove a per-instance information-theoretical lower
bound under the weak assumption that $d^\mu_h(s_h,a_h)>0$ if
$d^{\pi^\star}_h(s_h,a_h)>0$. Different from the previous minimax lower bounds,
the per-instance lower bound (via local minimaxity) is a much stronger
criterion as it applies to individual instances separately. Here $\pi^\star$ is
a optimal policy, $\mu$ is the behavior policy and $d_h^\mu$ is the marginal
state-action probability. We call the above equation the intrinsic offline
reinforcement learning bound since it directly implies all the existing optimal
results: minimax rate under uniform data-coverage assumption, horizon-free
setting, single policy concentrability, and the tight problem-dependent
results. Later, we extend the result to the assumption-free regime (where we
make no assumption on $ \mu$) and obtain the assumption-free intrinsic bound.
Due to its generic form, we believe the intrinsic bound could help illuminate

so OSN is a good platform for Steganography. But OSNs usually perform JPEG
compression on the uploaded image, which will invalidate most of the existing
steganography algorithms. Recently, some works try to design robust
steganography which can resist JPEG compression, such as Dither
Modulation-based robust Adaptive Steganography (DMAS) and Generalized dither
Modulation-based robust Adaptive Steganography (GMAS). They relieve the problem
that the receivers cannot extract the message correctly when the quality factor
of channel JPEG compression is larger than that of cover images. However, they
only can realize limited resistance to detection and compression due to robust
domain selection. To overcome this problem, we meticulously explore three lossy
operations in the JPEG recompression and discover that the key problem is
spatial overflow. Then two preprocessing methods Overall Scaling (OS) and
Specific Truncation (ST) are presented to remove overflow before message
embedding as well as generate a reference image. The reference image is
employed as the guidance to build asymmetric distortion for removing overflow
during embedding. Experimental results show that the proposed methods
significantly surpass GMAS in terms of security and achieve comparable
robustness.

certain structure elements on the basis of changes in displacements under

real-time remains a challenge. Displacement data provided by WSS in the field
undergoes additional processing and is seen at a different location by an
inspector and a sensor specialist. When the data is shared and streamed to the

bridges when the train is crossing the bridge for engineering decision making
of their assets. Measuring displacements under train crossing events is
difficult. If simplified reference-free methods would be accurate and
validated, owners would conduct objective performance assessment of their
bridge inventories under trains. Researchers have developed new sensing
technologies (reference-free) to overcome the limitations of reference
point-based displacement sensors. Reference-free methods use accelerometers to
estimate displacements, by decomposing the total displacement in two parts: a
high-frequency dynamic displacement component, and a low-frequency
pseudo-static displacement component. In the past, researchers have used the
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory formula to estimate the pseudo-static displacement
assuming railroad bridge piles and columns can be simplified as cantilever
beams. However, according to railroad bridge managers, railroad bridges have a
different degree of fixity for each pile of each bent. Displacements can be
estimated assuming a similar degree of fixity for deep foundations, but
inherent errors will affect the accuracy of displacement estimation. This paper
solves this problem expanding the 1 Degree of Freedom (1DOF) solution to a new
2 Degrees of Freedom (2DOF), to collect displacements under trains and enable
cost-effective condition-based information related to bridge safety.
Researchers developed a simplified beam to demonstrate the total displacement
estimation using 2DOF and further conducted experimental results in the
laboratory. The estimated displacement of the 2DOF model is more accurate than
that of the 1DOF model for ten train crossing events. With only one sensor
added to the ground of the pile, this method provides owners with approximately
40% more accurate displacements.

learning-based algorithms are two main streams in superpixel segmentation. The
former is non-differentiable and the latter needs a non-differentiable
post-processing step to enforce connectivity, which constraints the integration
of superpixels and downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning-based superpixel segmentation algorithm SIN which can be integrated
with downstream tasks in an end-to-end way. Owing to some downstream tasks such
as visual tracking require real-time speed, the speed of generating superpixels
is also important. To remove the post-processing step, our algorithm enforces
spatial connectivity from the start. Superpixels are initialized by sampled
pixels and other pixels are assigned to superpixels through multiple updating
steps. Each step consists of a horizontal and a vertical interpolation, which
is the key to enforcing spatial connectivity. Multi-layer outputs of a fully
convolutional network are utilized to predict association scores for
interpolations. Experimental results show that our approach runs at about 80fps
and performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we design
a simple but effective loss function which reduces much training time. The

functions that may conflict with each other. The notion of the Pareto set
allows us to focus on the set of (often infinite number of) models that cannot
be strictly improved. But it does not provide an actionable procedure for
picking one or a few special models to return to practical users. In this
paper, we consider \emph{optimization in Pareto set (OPT-in-Pareto)}, the
problem of finding Pareto models that optimize an extra reference criterion
function within the Pareto set. This function can either encode a specific
preference from the users, or represent a generic diversity measure for
obtaining a set of diversified Pareto models that are representative of the
whole Pareto set. Unfortunately, despite being a highly useful framework,
efficient algorithms for OPT-in-Pareto have been largely missing, especially
for large-scale, non-convex, and non-linear objectives in deep learning. A
naive approach is to apply Riemannian manifold gradient descent on the Pareto
set, which yields a high computational cost due to the need for
eigen-calculation of Hessian matrices. We propose a first-order algorithm that
approximately solves OPT-in-Pareto using only gradient information, with both
high practical efficiency and theoretically guaranteed convergence property.

metric to validate each training point's contribution to the model's

shown great results on wide node classification tasks. Yet, they are less
popular for practical deployments in the industry owing to their scalability
challenges incurred by data dependency. Namely, GNN inference depends on
neighbor nodes multiple hops away from the target, and fetching them burdens
latency-constrained applications. Existing inference acceleration methods like
pruning and quantization can speed up GNNs by reducing
Multiplication-and-ACcumulation (MAC) operations, but the improvements are
limited given the data dependency is not resolved. Conversely, multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) have no graph dependency and infer much faster than GNNs,
even though they are less accurate than GNNs for node classification in
general. Motivated by these complementary strengths and weaknesses, we bring
GNNs and MLPs together via knowledge distillation (KD). Our work shows that the
performance of MLPs can be improved by large margins with GNN KD. We call the
distilled MLPs Graph-less Neural Networks (GLNNs) as they have no inference
graph dependency. We show that GLNNs with competitive accuracy infer faster
than GNNs by 146X-273X and faster than other acceleration methods by 14X-27X.
Under a production setting involving both transductive and inductive
predictions across 7 datasets, GLNN accuracies improve over stand-alone MLPs by

novel occlusion-aware voting network that can first reliably produce visible
joint-level features from the input partial point clouds, and then complete the
joint-level features through the kinematic tree of the human skeleton. Compared
with holistic features used by previous works, the joint-level features can not
only effectively encode the human geometry information but also be robust to
noisy inputs with self-occlusions and missing areas. By exploiting the rich
complementary clues from the joint-level features and global features from the
input point clouds, the proposed method encourages reliable and disentangled
parameter predictions for statistical 3D human models, such as SMPL. The
proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on two large-scale

system exhibits much easier readout mechanism due to its real frequency
splitting. Generally, such systems need to be operated at exceptional points
(EPs) to obtain the best performance. However, strict conditons to locate APT
symmetric systems at their EPs precisely put restraints on their practical
applications. To overcome this problem, we propose a scheme to manipulate the
EPs in APT symmetric configuration by Kerr effect. It is demonstrated that
operating EPs by self-phase modulation alone will impede the frequency
splitting caused by external perturbations, while cross-phase modulation can
enhance the response to measurable perturbations. We also investigate the
thermal effect induced by high light intensity, which could reduce the power to
manipulate EPs. This proposed scheme can pave a new way in fabricating devices
based on APT symmetry.

and extinction of stoichiometric hydrogen/oxygen/argon detonations in ultrafine
water sprays. Three detonation propagation modes are found: (1) pulsating
propagation, (2) propagation followed by extinction, and (3) immediate
extinction. For pulsating detonation, within one cycle, the propagation speeds
and the distance between reaction front (RF) and shock front (SF) change
periodically. The pulsating phenomenon originates from the interactions between
gas dynamics, chemical kinetics, and droplet dynamics inside the induction
zone. Multiple pressure waves are emanated from the RF within one cycle, which
overtake and intensify the lead SF. An autoigniting spot arises in the shocked
gas after the contact surface. The relative locations of SF, RF, shock-frame
sonic point, and two-phase contact surface remain unchanged in a pulsating
cycle, but their distances have periodic variations. Moreover, the unsteady
behaviors of detonation extinction include continuously increased distance
between the RF and SF and quickly reduced pressure peaks, temperature, and
combustion heat release. The decoupling of RF and SF leads to significantly
increasing chemical timescale of the shocked mixture. The hydrodynamic
structure also changes considerably when detonation extinction occurs.
Moreover, the predicted map of detonation propagation and extinction
illustrates that the critical mass loading for detonation extinction reduces
significantly when the droplet size becomes smaller. It is also found that for
the same droplet size, the average detonation speed monotonically decreases
with water mass loading. However, detonation speed and pulsating frequency have
a non-monotonic dependence on droplet size under a constant water mass loading.

that this is a fundamental limitation, related to the fact that existing models

recognition stage leads to the initial activation of class candidates, which is

forgetting in neural networks. However, to obtain better performance, former
methods have higher demands for pseudo-data of the previous tasks. The
performance dramatically decreases when fewer pseudo-data are employed. In
addition, the distribution of pseudo-data gradually deviates from the real data
with the sequential learning of different tasks. The deviation will be greater
with more tasks learned, which results in more serious catastrophic forgetting.
To address these issues, we propose reminding incremental language model via
data-free self-distillation (DFSD), which includes self-distillation based on
the Earth Mover's Distance and hidden data augmentation. By estimating the
knowledge distribution in all layers of GPT-2 and transforming it from teacher
model to student model, the Self-distillation based on the Earth Mover's
Distance can significantly reduce the demand for pseudo-data. Hidden data
augmentation can greatly alleviate the catastrophic forgetting caused by
deviations via modeling the generation of pseudo-data as a hidden data
augmentation process, where each sample is a mixture of all trained task data.
The experimental results demonstrate that our DFSD can exceed the previous
state-of-the-art methods even if the maximum decrease in pseudo-data is 90%.

then derive the expression for the achievable sum SE. These expressions are
also derived for another well known OMA method where guard bands (GB) are used
to reduce MUI (called as the GB based MA methods) [19]. Through simulations, we
observe that with rectangular pulses the sum SE achieved by the method in [21]

require the full task information, but rather a specification of the utility of
the task, resulting in predictors that serve a wide range of downstream tasks.
We demonstrate our approach on two use cases of common decision making tasks

Our main result is a family of sharp Poincar\'e-type inequality on the circular

data, such as chemical networks, brain networks, and social networks, modelling
complex relationships and interdependency between objects. Recently, Membership
Inference Attack (MIA) against GNNs raises severe privacy concerns, where
training data can be leaked from trained GNN models. However, prior studies
focus on inferring the membership of only the components in a graph, e.g., an
individual node or edge. How to infer the membership of an entire graph record
is yet to be explored.
  In this paper, we take the first step in MIA against GNNs for graph-level
classification. Our objective is to infer whether a graph sample has been used
for training a GNN model. We present and implement two types of attacks, i.e.,
training-based attacks and threshold-based attacks from different adversarial
capabilities. We perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate our attacks in
seven real-world datasets using five representative GNN models. Both our
attacks are shown effective and can achieve high performance, i.e., reaching
over 0.7 attack F1 scores in most cases. Furthermore, we analyse the
implications behind the MIA against GNNs. Our findings confirm that GNNs can be
even more vulnerable to MIA than the models with non-graph structures. And
unlike the node-level classifier, MIAs on graph-level classification tasks are
more co-related with the overfitting level of GNNs rather than the statistic
property of their training graphs.

improve the performance of the ReLU-based network as it is iteratively pruned.
Our work and contribution consist of four parts: (i) We find that, as the
ReLU-based network is iteratively pruned, the distribution of weight gradients
tends to become narrower. This leads to the finding that as the network becomes
more sparse, a larger value of LR should be used to train the pruned network.
(ii) Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel LR schedule, called
S-Cyclical (S-Cyc) which adapts the conventional cyclical LR schedule by
gradually increasing the LR upper bound (max_lr) in an S-shape as the network
is iteratively pruned.We highlight that S-Cyc is a method agnostic LR schedule
that applies to many iterative pruning methods. (iii) We evaluate the
performance of the proposed S-Cyc and compare it to four LR schedule
benchmarks. Our experimental results on three state-of-the-art networks (e.g.,
VGG-19, ResNet-20, ResNet-50) and two popular datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10,

performing benchmark with an improvement of 2.1% - 3.4%, without substantial
increase in complexity. (iv) We evaluate S-Cyc against an oracle and show that
S-Cyc achieves comparable performance to the oracle, which carefully tunes
max_lr via grid search.

the history length. To alleviate the time dependence when reasoning future
missing facts, we propose a memory-triggered decision-making (MTDM) network,
which incorporates transient memories, long-short-term memories, and deep

memories as a static knowledge graph, and the time-aware recurrent evolution
network learns representations through a sequence of recurrent evolution units
from long-short-term memories. Each evolution unit consists of a structural
encoder to aggregate edge information, a time encoder with a gating unit to
update attribute representations of entities. MTDM utilizes the crafted
residual multi-relational aggregator as the structural encoder to solve the
multi-hop coverage problem. We also introduce the dissolution learning

experiments demonstrate the MTDM alleviates the history dependence and achieves

recently, an MHD turbulent heating model based on advection was shown to also
explain the temperature increase at Jupiter and Saturn. We further develop this

The combined model resolves the physical consistency requirement that diffusion
should dominate over advection when the radial flow velocity is small and vice
versa when it is large. Comparisons with observations show that previous
agreements, using the advection only model, are still valid for larger radial
distance. Moreover, the additional heating by diffusion results in a better
agreement with the temperature observations for smaller radial distance.

with delay and angle information of MPCs are based on the distance metric that
quantifies the similarity of two MPCs and determines the preferred cluster
shape, greatly impacting MPC clustering quality. In this paper, a general
framework of Mahalanobis-distance metric is proposed for MPC clustering in MIMO
channel analysis, without user-specified parameters. Remarkably, the popular
multipath component distance (MCD) is proved to be a special case of the
proposed distance metric framework. Furthermore, two machine learning
algorithms, namely, weak-supervised Mahalanobis metric for clustering and
supervised large margin nearest neighbor, are introduced to learn the distance
metric. To evaluate the effectiveness, a modified channel model is proposed
based on the 3GPP spatial channel model to generate clustered MPCs with delay
and angular information, since the original 3GPP spatial channel model (SCM) is
incapable to evaluate clustering quality. Experiment results show that the
proposed distance metric can significantly improve the clustering quality of
existing clustering algorithms, while the learning phase requires considerably
limited efforts of labeling MPCs.

low-rankness of frontal slices is not significant under linear transforms
family. To better pursue the low-rank approximation, we propose a nonlinear

is a composite transform consisting of the linear semi-orthogonal transform

representation learning, dictionary learning or sparse coding. We consider a
setting where the two factors are generated from known component-wise
independent prior distributions, and the statistician observes a (possibly
noisy) component-wise function of their matrix product. In the limit where the
dimensions of the matrices tend to infinity, but their ratios remain fixed, we
expect to be able to derive closed form expressions for the optimal mean
squared error on the estimation of the two factors. However, this remains a
very involved mathematical and algorithmic problem. A related, but simpler,
problem is extensive-rank matrix denoising, where one aims to reconstruct a
matrix with extensive but usually small rank from noisy measurements. In this
paper, we approach both these problems using high-temperature expansions at
fixed order parameters. This allows to clarify how previous attempts at solving
these problems failed at finding an asymptotically exact solution. We provide a
systematic way to derive the corrections to these existing approximations,
taking into account the structure of correlations particular to the problem.
Finally, we illustrate our approach in detail on the case of extensive-rank
matrix denoising. We compare our results with known optimal
rotationally-invariant estimators, and show how exact asymptotic calculations
of the minimal error can be performed using extensive-rank matrix integrals.

most common cause of cancer in the US. Development of colorectal polyps is one
of the earliest signs of cancer. Early detection and resection of polyps can
greatly increase survival rate to 90%. Manual inspection can cause
misdetections because polyps vary in color, shape, size and appearance. To this
end, Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems(CADx) has been proposed that detect
polyps by processing the colonoscopic videos. The system acts a secondary check
to help clinicians reduce misdetections so that polyps may be resected before
they transform to cancer. Polyps vary in color, shape, size, texture and
appearance. As a result, the miss rate of polyps is between 6% and 27% despite
the prominence of CADx solutions. Furthermore, sessile and flat polyps which
have diameter less than 10 mm are more likely to be undetected. Convolutional
Neural Networks(CNN) have shown promising results in polyp segmentation.
However, all of these works have a supervised approach and are limited by the
size of the dataset. It was observed that smaller datasets reduce the
segmentation accuracy of ResUNet++. We train a U-Net to inpaint randomly
dropped out pixels in the image as a proxy task. The dataset we use for

on the limited Kvasir-Sessile dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate
that with limited annotated dataset and a larger unlabeled dataset,
self-supervised approach is a better alternative than fully supervised

vessel, are used to absorb the energy of the two Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
intense proton beams during operation of the accelerator. Operational issues
started to appear in 2015 during LHC Run 2 (2014-2018) as a consequence of the
progressive increase of the LHC beam kinetic energy, necessitating technical
interventions in the highly radioactive areas around the dumps. Nitrogen gas
leaks appeared after highly energetic beam impacts and instrumentation

were that the amount of instantaneous energy deposited in the dump vessel leads
to a strong dynamic response of the whole dump and high accelerations (above
2000g). Based on these findings, an upgraded design, including a new support
system and beam windows, was implemented to ensure the dumps' compatibility

state of quantum many body systems and play an important role in the
simulations of them. Numerous TNS are proposed in the past few decades.
However, due to the high cost of TNS for two-dimensional systems, a balance
between the encoded entanglement and computational complexity of TNS is yet to
be reached. In this work we introduce a new Tree Tensor Network (TTN) based TNS
dubbed as Fully- Augmented Tree Tensor Network (FATTN) by releasing the
constraint in Augmented Tree Tensor Network (ATTN). When disentanglers are
augmented in the physical layer of TTN, FATTN can provide more entanglement
than TTN and ATTN. At the same time, FATTN maintains the scaling of
computational cost with bond dimension in TTN and ATTN. Benchmark results on
the ground state energy for the transverse Ising model are provided to
demonstrate the improvement of accuracy of FATTN over TTN and ATTN. Moreover,
FATTN is quite flexible which can be constructed as an interpolation between
Tree Tensor Network and Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA)
to reach a balance between the encoded entanglement and the computational cost.

has ever condensed on the surface of Venus because the planet - now completely
dry - has undergone global resurfacing events that obscure most of its history.
The conditions required for water to have initially condensed on the surface of
Solar System terrestrial planets are highly uncertain, as they have so far only
been studied with one-dimensional numerical climate models that cannot account
for the effects of atmospheric circulation and clouds, which are key climate
stabilizers. Here we show using three-dimensional global climate model
simulations of early Venus and Earth that water clouds - which preferentially
form on the nightside, owing to the strong subsolar water vapour absorption -
have a strong net warming effect that inhibits surface water condensation even
at modest insolations (down to 325 W/m2, that is, 0.95 times the Earth solar
constant). This shows that water never condensed and that, consequently, oceans
never formed on the surface of Venus. Furthermore, this shows that the
formation of Earth's oceans required much lower insolation than today, which
was made possible by the faint young Sun. This also implies the existence of
another stability state for present-day Earth: the 'Steam Earth', with all the
water from the oceans evaporated into the atmosphere.

drones can use trucks as temporary modes of transit en route to their own
destinations. Such coordination can yield significant savings in total vehicle
distance traveled, i.e., truck travel distance and drone flight distance,
compared to operating drones and trucks independently. But it comes at the
potentially prohibitive computational cost of deciding which trucks and drones
should coordinate and when and where it is most beneficial to do so. We tackle
this fundamental trade-off by decoupling our overall intractable problem into
tractable sub-problems that we solve stage-wise. The first stage solves only
for trucks, by computing paths that make them more likely to be useful transit
options for drones. The second stage solves only for drones, by routing them
over a composite of the road network and the transit network defined by truck
paths from the first stage. We design a comprehensive algorithmic framework
that frames each stage as a multi-agent path-finding problem and implement two
distinct methods for solving them. We evaluate our approach on extensive
simulations with up to $100$ agents on the real-world Manhattan road network

more than $50\%$ of vehicle distance traveled compared to independently solving

increasing divergence with the mode order severely limits the practically

three independent degrees of freedom (DoFs) including central OAM, sub-beam

center offset and coherent background noise. Our work provides a useful basis

the coupling between the magnetic field and Berry curvature. By fully
incorporating both the field-driven anisotropy and inherent anisotropy in the

in topological materials with a nonvanishing Berry curvature. We show that as a
solution to the Boltzmann transport equation the effective mean-free-path

arising from the coupling between the magnetic field, Berry curvature and
mobility. We also calculate the conductivity of Weyl semimetals with an
isotropic energy dispersion, and find that the coupling between the magnetic

substantial deviation from the result obtained assuming a constant relaxation

  Methods: we enrolled 400 patients who had either liver resection or a biopsy
and was diagnosed with either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, or secondary metastasis, from 2006 to 2019. Each patient
was scanned with T1WI, T2WI, T1WI venous phase (T2WI-V), T1WI arterial phase

that localizes lesions from 3D MRI studies using key-slice parsing and provides
a confidence measure for its diagnoses. We evaluate using five-fold cross
validation and compare performance against three radiologists, including a
senior hepatology radiologist, a junior hepatology radiologist and an abdominal

  Results: the proposed CAD solution achieves a mean F1 score of 0.62,
outperforming the abdominal radiologist (0.47), matching the junior hepatology
radiologist (0.61), and underperforming the senior hepatology radiologist
(0.68). The CAD system can informatively assess its diagnostic confidence,
i.e., when only evaluating on the 70% most confident cases the mean f1 score

observed in the WASP-148 system is consistent with the orderly-alignment
configuration of most compact multi-planet systems around cool stars with

occurred in isolation, with relatively little disturbance. By contrast,
previous results have indicated that high-mass and hot stars appear to more
commonly host a wide range of misaligned planets: not only single hot Jupiters,
but also compact systems with multiple super-Earths. We suggest that, to
account for the high rate of spin-orbit misalignments in both compact
multi-planet and isolated-hot-Jupiter systems orbiting high-mass and hot stars,
spin-orbit misalignments may be caused by distant giant planet perturbers,
which are most common around these stellar types.

rational CFTs have an extended chiral algebra generated by three currents. We
consider the modular average of the vacuum character in these theories, which
results in a weighted average over all modular invariants. In the simplest
case, when the chiral algebra is primitive (in a sense we explain), the weights
in this ensemble average are all equal. In the non-primitive case the ensemble
weights are governed by a semigroup structure on the space of modular
invariants.
  These observations can be viewed as evidence for a holographic duality
between the ensemble of CFTs and an exotic gravity theory based on a compact
$U(1) \times U(1)$ Chern-Simons action. In the bulk description, the extended

there has been some resurgence in relooking the way pooling is done in CNNs.
The fundamental building block of the anti-aliased CNN has been the application
of Gaussian smoothing before the pooling operation to reduce the distortion due
to aliasing thereby making CNNs shift invariant. Wavelet based approaches have
also been proposed as a possibility of additional noise removal capability and
gave interesting results for even segmentation tasks. However, all the
approaches proposed completely remove the high frequency components under the
assumption that they are noise. However, by removing high frequency components,
the edges in the feature maps are also smoothed. In this work, an exhaustive
analysis of the edge preserving pooling options for classification,
segmentation and autoencoders are presented. Two novel pooling approaches are
presented such as Laplacian-Gaussian Concatenation with Attention (LGCA)
pooling and Wavelet based approximate-detailed coefficient concatenation with
attention (WADCA) pooling. The results suggest that the proposed pooling
approaches outperform the conventional pooling as well as blur pooling for
classification, segmentation and autoencoders.

multiple documents. Most existing work approaches the task in a semi-supervised
manner due to the difficulty of obtaining high-quality annotation from

proxy for identifying opinions. In this work, we propose a new framework,
FineSum, which advances this frontier in three aspects: (1) minimal
supervision, where only aspect names and a few aspect/sentiment keywords are
available; (2) fine-grained opinion analysis, where sentiment analysis drills
down to the sub-aspect level; and (3) phrase-based summarization, where opinion
is summarized in the form of phrases. FineSum automatically identifies opinion
phrases from the raw corpus, classifies them into different aspects and
sentiments, and constructs multiple fine-grained opinion clusters under each
aspect/sentiment. Each cluster consists of semantically coherent phrases,
expressing uniform opinions towards certain sub-aspect or characteristics
(e.g., positive feelings for ``burgers'' in the ``food'' aspect). An
opinion-oriented spherical word embedding space is trained to provide weak
supervision for the phrase classifier, and phrase clustering is performed using
the aspect-aware contextualized embedding generated from the phrase classifier.
Both automatic evaluation on the benchmark and quantitative human evaluation
validate the effectiveness of our approach.

learning, through which the agent can provably extract endogenous, latent state

such approaches can fail in the presence of temporally correlated noise in the

highlighting failure cases of prior representation learning based approaches.
Then, we introduce the Predictive Path Elimination (PPE) algorithm, that learns
a generalization of inverse dynamics and is provably sample and computationally
efficient in EX-BMDPs when the endogenous state dynamics are near

adjust for ORB in MMA. We further propose a measure for quantifying the impact

to tackle the link prediction problem, most of them suppose that the network
structure is dominated by the Triadic Closure Principle. We still lack an
adaptive and comprehensive understanding of network formation patterns for
predicting potential links. In addition, it is valuable to investigate how
network local information can be better utilized. To this end, we proposed a
novel method named Link prediction using Multiple Order Local Information
(MOLI) that exploits the local information from the neighbors of different
distances, with parameters that can be a prior-driven based on prior knowledge,
or data-driven by solving an optimization problem on observed networks. MOLI
defined a local network diffusion process via random walks on the graph,
resulting in better use of network information. We show that MOLI outperforms
the other 11 widely used link prediction algorithms on 11 different types of
simulated and real-world networks. We also conclude that there are different
patterns of local information utilization for different networks, including
social networks, communication networks, biological networks, etc. In
particular, the classical common neighbor-based algorithm is not as adaptable

from data stream using each data only once for training, which is more
realistic than in offline mode assuming data from new task are all available.
However, this problem is still under-explored for the challenging
class-incremental setting in which the model classifies all classes seen so far
during inference. Particularly, performance struggles with increased number of
tasks or additional classes to learn for each task. In addition, most existing
methods require storing original data as exemplars for knowledge replay, which
may not be feasible for certain applications with limited memory budget or
privacy concerns. In this work, we introduce an effective and memory-efficient
method for online continual learning under class-incremental setting through
candidates selection from each learned task together with prior incorporation
using stored feature embeddings instead of original data as exemplars. Our
proposed method implemented for image classification task achieves the best
results under different benchmark datasets for online continual learning

Geminga and Monogem pulsars by HAWC collaboration implies that the halo-like
morphologies around middle-aged pulsars may be common. The $\gamma$-rays above
10 TeV are thought to arise from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of
relativistic electrons/positrons in the pulsar halos off cosmic microwave
background photons. In the meanwhile, these electrons and positrons can produce
X-ray synchrotron emission in the interstellar magnetic field, resulting in a
diffuse emission in the X-ray band (namely X-ray halos). Here, we study the
prospect of detecting X-ray halos with eROSITA from 10 middle-aged pulsars with
characteristic age larger than tens of thousands of years in the ATNF pulsar
catalog. Assuming a benchmark value (i.e., $B = 3 \rm \, \mu G$) for the
magnetic field, most of the X-ray halos are found to be bright enough to be
detectable by eROSITA in the energy range of 0.5-2 keV during its four-year
all-sky survey. Among these pulsar halos, three are supposed to produce X-ray
fluxes above the eROSITA sensitivity of the first all-sky survey. Given the
good angular resolution and the large field of view, eROSITA is expected to be
able to measure the spatial distribution of the X-ray halos from sub-pc scale
up to tens of pc scale. The intensity profiles of the X-ray halos are very
useful to constrain the magnetic field and the energy-dependence of the
diffusion coefficient in the pulsar halos.

in the human brain, represents and transmits information in spike trains
containing wealthy spatial and temporal information, and shows superior
performance on many cognitive tasks. In addition, the event-driven information
processing enables the energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic chips.
The success of deep learning is inseparable from backpropagation. Due to the
discrete information transmission, directly applying the backpropagation to the
training of the SNN still has a performance gap compared with the traditional
deep neural networks. Also, a large simulation time is required to achieve
better performance, which results in high latency. To address the problems, we
propose a biological plausible spatial adjustment, which rethinks the
relationship between membrane potential and spikes and realizes a reasonable
adjustment of gradients to different time steps. And it precisely controls the
backpropagation of the error along the spatial dimension. Secondly, we propose
a biologically plausible temporal adjustment making the error propagate across
the spikes in the temporal dimension, which overcomes the problem of the
temporal dependency within a single spike period of the traditional spiking
neurons. We have verified our algorithm on several datasets, and the
experimental results have shown that our algorithm greatly reduces the network
latency and energy consumption while also improving network performance. We
have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the neuromorphic datasets

of this approach is to preserve the content of the image and the watermark
simultaneously, this is achieved by synthesizing an encrypted watermark from

the image. To evaluate the proposed code the Least Significant Bit (LSB),
Bit2SB, and Bit3SB were used. The evaluation of the proposed code showed that
the LSB is of better quality but overall the Bit2SB is better in its ability
against the active attacks up to a size of 2*2 pixels, and it preserves the

where all the eigenstates have their amplitudes concentrating to the open
boundaries of the systems and decaying exponentially into the bulk. Later,
certain open systems obeying the quadratic Lindblad equation has also been
found to exhibit the skin effect, which is manifested in the ``chiral damping""
phenomenon as the particle populations, decaying from their initial uniform
unity values, show asymmetry with respect to the open boundaries. However, in
those open systems, each cell couples to the environment in an identical way.
It is natural to expect that the long time steady state of those open systems
shall have spatially uniform particle populations. Furthermore, particle
population variations due to the excitation of normal modes on top of the
steady state shall also not show asymmetry with respect to the open boundaries.
To reconcile the natural expectations with the skin effect, we employ an
adjoint fermion formalism to study the quadratic Lindbladian systems. We work
out the long time steady state and the normal modes on top of it, which exhibit
no asymmetry as expected. We show that it is the interference between the

  Gothenburg, Sweden, v2: references added",,,,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The landscape of possible four-dimensional low-energy effective theories
arising from compactifications of string/M-theory seems vast. This might lead
one to believe that any consistent-looking effective field theory coupled to
gravity can be obtained as a low-energy limit of string theory. However, a set
of ""swampland"" conjectures suggests that this is not true and that, in fact,
there is an even larger set of effective field theories that cannot be obtained
in this way. In particular, the AdS instability swampland conjecture asserts
that nonsupersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua are unstable. These swampland
criteria can have implications for, for instance, low-energy physics and
cosmology.
  M-theory is a nonperturbative unification of all superstring theories. Its
low-energy limit, eleven-dimensional supergravity, admits two compactifications
on the squashed seven-sphere. One of the solutions has one unbroken
supersymmetry ($\mathcal{N} = 1$) while the other has none ($\mathcal{N} = 0$).
Due to the AdS instability swampland conjecture, the latter should be unstable.
However, this has not been demonstrated explicitly. To study the stability of
the $\mathcal{N} = 0$ vacuum, we investigate the mass spectrum of the theory.
The main advancement compared to previous attempts is the realisation that all
mass operators in the Freund-Rubin compactification are related to a universal
Laplacian, allowing us to relate Weyl tensor terms to group invariants. One
limitation of the group-theoretical method we employ is that it can lead to
false roots. This is remedied, at least in part, by demanding that the fields
form supermultiplets in the $\mathcal{N} = 1$ case. Although we arrive at an
eigenvalue spectrum for all operators of interest, there is a hint that the
results may be incomplete. Thus, we do not reach a decisive conclusion
regarding the investigated type of instability.

algebras $\textit{C}\ell^{\texttt{R}}$(0,8)$, \textit{C}\ell^{\texttt{R}}$(1,7)
representations. Comparison with the corresponded algebras in the space of
standard 4-component Dirac spinors is demonstrated. The proposed mathematical
objects allow generalization of our results, obtained earlier for the standard
Dirac equation, for equations of higher spin and, especially, for equations,
describing particles with spin 3/2. The maximal 84-dimensional pure matrix
algebra of invariance of the 8-component Dirac equation in the
Foldy--Wouthuysen representation is found. The corresponding symmetry of the
Dirac equation in ordinary representation is found as well. The possible
generalizations of considered Lie algebras to the arbitrary dimensional SO(n)
and SO(m,n) are discussed briefly.

biophysical evidence. Recent pandemic emphasized the need to address the rising
number of mood disorders (in particular, depression) cases in a more efficient
way. We are proposing several already developed practices that can help improve
that diagnostic process: detection based on electrophysiological signals (both
electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram based) that were shown to be
accurate for clinical practice and several modalities of electromagnetic
stimulation that were proven to ameliorate symptoms of depression. In this
work, we are connecting the two with explanations coming from physiological
complexity studies (and our own work) as well as advanced statistical methods
like machine learning and the Bayesian inference approach. It is shown that
fractal and nonlinear measures can adequately quantify previously undetected
changes in intrinsic dynamics of physiological systems, providing the basis for
early detection of depression. We are also advocating for early screening of
cardiovascular risks in depression which is in connection to previously
described decomplexification of the autonomous nervous system resulting in
symptoms recognized clinically. All that said, additional information about the
level of complexity can help clinicians make a better decisions in the
therapeutic process, increase the overall effectiveness of the treatment, and
finally increase the quality of life of the patient.

a semi-metallic two-dimensional (2D) material that can be synthesized below

Si waveguides. The PDs operate at 1550 nm wavelength with a maximum

outperform PtSe$_2$ PDs manufactured by standard 2D layer transfer. The
combination of IR responsivity, chemical stability, selective and conformal

PtSe$_2$ an attractive 2D material for optoelectronics and PICs.

  Classification Problems",,,,,"cs.NE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The population-based optimization algorithms have provided promising results
in feature selection problems. However, the main challenges are high time
complexity. Moreover, the interaction between features is another big challenge
in FS problems that directly affects the classification performance. In this
paper, an estimation of distribution algorithm is proposed to meet three goals.
Firstly, as an extension of EDA, the proposed method generates only two
individuals in each iteration that compete based on a fitness function and
evolve during the algorithm, based on our proposed update procedure. Secondly,
we provide a guiding technique for determining the number of features for
individuals in each iteration. As a result, the number of selected features of
the final solution will be optimized during the evolution process. The two
mentioned advantages can increase the convergence speed of the algorithm.
Thirdly, as the main contribution of the paper, in addition to considering the
importance of each feature alone, the proposed method can consider the
interaction between features. Thus, it can deal with complementary features and
consequently increase classification performance. To do this, we provide a
conditional probability scheme that considers the joint probability
distribution of selecting two features. The introduced probabilities
successfully detect correlated features. Experimental results on a synthetic
dataset with correlated features prove the performance of our proposed approach
facing these types of features. Furthermore, the results on 13 real-world
datasets obtained from the UCI repository show the superiority of the proposed
method in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.

single target tracking task in recent years. Generally, training a deep CNN
model requires numerous labeled training samples, and the number and quality of
these samples directly affect the representational capability of the trained
model. However, this approach is restrictive in practice, because manually
labeling such a large number of training samples is time-consuming and
prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose an active learning method
for deep visual tracking, which selects and annotates the unlabeled samples to
train the deep CNNs model. Under the guidance of active learning, the tracker
based on the trained deep CNNs model can achieve competitive tracking
performance while reducing the labeling cost. More specifically, to ensure the
diversity of selected samples, we propose an active learning method based on
multi-frame collaboration to select those training samples that should be and
need to be annotated. Meanwhile, considering the representativeness of these
selected samples, we adopt a nearest neighbor discrimination method based on
the average nearest neighbor distance to screen isolated samples and
low-quality samples. Therefore, the training samples subset selected based on
our method requires only a given budget to maintain the diversity and
representativeness of the entire sample set. Furthermore, we adopt a Tversky
loss to improve the bounding box estimation of our tracker, which can ensure
that the tracker achieves more accurate target states. Extensive experimental
results confirm that our active learning-based tracker (ALT) achieves
competitive tracking accuracy and speed compared with state-of-the-art trackers
on the seven most challenging evaluation benchmarks.

making a driving decision based on these observations (steer, brake, coast,
etc.). In autonomous driving, all these tasks have to be automated. Autonomous
driving technology thus far has relied primarily on machine learning
techniques. We argue that appropriate technology should be used for the
appropriate task. That is, while machine learning technology is good for
observing and automatically understanding the surroundings of an automobile,
driving decisions are better automated via commonsense reasoning rather than
machine learning. In this paper, we discuss (i) how commonsense reasoning can
be automated using answer set programming (ASP) and the goal-directed s(CASP)
ASP system, and (ii) develop the AUTO-DISCERN system using this technology for
automating decision-making in driving. The goal of our research, described in
this paper, is to develop an autonomous driving system that works by simulating
the mind of a human driver. Since driving decisions are based on human-style
reasoning, they are explainable, their ethics can be ensured, and they will
always be correct, provided the system modeling and system inputs are correct.

what we see, is a specific space different from the purely physical one and
that its properties imply that it cannot be reduced to or deduced from physical
laws. Some biological points are also briefly considered. The arguments are of
logical, mathematical and physical character, and although elementary they
require a careful reading. A first shorter version of this paper appeared in a
hardly accessible Journal [1], and presented at the International Congress of
Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Sciences, in Beijing, August 2007. There
is no need to define consciousness; we only observe some of its properties,
namely geometric and topological properties of visual consciousness, and show
that these properties cannot be based on physics only. Now, if a part of
consciousness cannot be grounded on physics only, it is the same for
consciousness as a whole and we speak of the irreducibility of consciousness to
physical data. We do not consider philosophical questions or issues; in a
simple physical and mathematical frame we give a logical proof of this
irreducibility. Elements for a formal mathematical, logical proof are mentioned
at the end of the paper.
