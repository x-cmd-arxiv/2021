properties of turbulence across the coronal heights.Theoretical models have
shown that the apparent intensity and size of the burst sources evolve at
sub-second scales under the influence of local turbulence. The properties of
the evolution varies with observation frequency. However, observational studies
remained difficult due to the lack of high fidelity imaging capabilities at
these fine temporal scales simultaneously across wide spectral bands. I present
a spectroscopic snapshot imaging (0.5 s, 160 kHz resolution) study of a
type-III burst event across 80 - 200 MHz band. By modelling the temporal
variability of the source sizes and intensity at every observation frequency,
the characteristics of coronal turbulence is studied across a heliocentric
height range of ~1.54 - 1.75 $R_\odot$. To understand the morphological
evolution of the type-III source, a 2D Gaussian fitting procedure is used. The
observed trends in the source area and integrated flux density are analysed in
the framework of theoretical and data driven models.Results.The strength of
density fluctuations ($\delta N/N$) in the corona is derived as a function of
height (R). Combined with the archival low frequency data, $\delta N/N$ values
across ~1.5 - 2.2 $R_\odot$ agree within a few factors. The burst decay time
($\tau_{decay}$) and the FWHM of the source showed a power-law dependency with
frequency, roughly consistent with the results from data driven models.
However,the values of $\tau_{decay}$ across frequency are higher than expected.
The intrinsic sizes of the burst source were derived correcting for scatter
broadening. This roughly matched the expected size of flux tubes at the coronal
heights explored. I also report the observation of an intrinsic anti-phased
pulsation in area and flux density of the source.

  Leaf-Refinement","2 algorithms, 6 tables, 4 plots and a very long appendix",,,,"cs.LG cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Random Forests (RF) are among the state-of-the-art in many machine learning
applications. With the ongoing integration of ML models into everyday life, the
deployment and continuous application of models becomes more and more an
important issue. Hence, small models which offer good predictive performance
but use small amounts of memory are required. Ensemble pruning is a standard
technique to remove unnecessary classifiers from an ensemble to reduce the
overall resource consumption and sometimes even improve the performance of the
original ensemble. In this paper, we revisit ensemble pruning in the context of
`modernly' trained Random Forests where trees are very large. We show that the
improvement effects of pruning diminishes for ensembles of large trees but that
pruning has an overall better accuracy-memory trade-off than RF. However,
pruning does not offer fine-grained control over this trade-off because it
removes entire trees from the ensemble. To further improve the accuracy-memory
trade-off we present a simple, yet surprisingly effective algorithm that
refines the predictions in the leaf nodes in the forest via stochastic gradient
descent. We evaluate our method against 7 state-of-the-art pruning methods and
show that our method outperforms the other methods on 11 of 16 datasets with a
statistically significant better accuracy-memory trade-off compared to most
methods. We conclude our experimental evaluation with a case study showing that
our method can be applied in a real-world setting.

for the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical method to improve its
stability and accuracy for free surface flow simulations. We introduce a
general form of the Dynamic pair-wise Particle Collision (DPC) regularization
technique that we recently proposed in the context of the Moving Particle
Semi-implicit (MPS) method in [1]. The DPC coupled with the standard Particle
Shifting (PS) technique has given rise to a hybrid approach that we propose to
alleviate particle clustering issues in the free-surface and splashed regions.
We validate the proposed techniques to four benchmark cases: (i) the
oscillating droplet, (ii) the two-dimensional water dam-break, (iii) the
two-dimensional water sloshing, and (iv) the three-dimensional water dam break
against a rigid obstacle. We evaluate their impacts on the stability, accuracy
and the conservation properties of the test cases. The qualitative and
quantitative analysis of the results shows that despite its simplicity, the DPC
technique is more effective in reducing the spatial disorder and capturing the
impact events compared with the standard and the newly improved hybrid PS
methods. Although the hybrid PS technique improves particle distribution at the
free surface, it still suffers from the inconsistent implementation of the PS
equation which unphysically increases the fluid volume and violates the
conservation of potential energy in the long-term simulations. Overall, the
conservative DPC algorithm proves to be a simple and efficient alternative
regularization technique for simulating such highly dynamic free-surface flows.

structured class of Markov decision processes that arise from repeated
interactions with an exogenous sequence of arrivals with contexts, which
generate unknown individual-level responses to agent actions. This model can be
thought of as an offline generalization of contextual bandits with resource
constraints. We formalize the relevant causal structure of problems such as
dynamic personalized pricing and other operations management problems in the
presence of potentially high-dimensional user types. The key insight is that an
individual-level response is often not causally affected by the state variable
and can therefore easily be generalized across timesteps and states. When this
is true, we study implications for (doubly robust) off-policy evaluation and
learning by instead leveraging single time-step evaluation, estimating the
expectation over a single arrival via data from a population, for fitted-value
iteration in a marginal MDP. We study sample complexity and analyze error
amplification that leads to the persistence, rather than attenuation, of
confounding error over time. In simulations of dynamic and capacitated pricing,
we show improved out-of-sample policy performance in this class of relevant
problems.

  Processes","15 pages, 4 figures",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a nonparametric factorization approach for sparsely observed
tensors. The sparsity does not mean zero-valued entries are massive or
dominated. Rather, it implies the observed entries are very few, and even fewer
with the growth of the tensor; this is ubiquitous in practice. Compared with
the existent works, our model not only leverages the structural information
underlying the observed entry indices, but also provides extra interpretability
and flexibility -- it can simultaneously estimate a set of location factors
about the intrinsic properties of the tensor nodes, and another set of
sociability factors reflecting their extrovert activity in interacting with
others; users are free to choose a trade-off between the two types of factors.
Specifically, we use hierarchical Gamma processes and Poisson random measures
to construct a tensor-valued process, which can freely sample the two types of
factors to generate tensors and always guarantees an asymptotic sparsity. We
then normalize the tensor process to obtain hierarchical Dirichlet processes to
sample each observed entry index, and use a Gaussian process to sample the
entry value as a nonlinear function of the factors, so as to capture both the
sparse structure properties and complex node relationships. For efficient
inference, we use Dirichlet process properties over finite sample partitions,
density transformations, and random features to develop a stochastic
variational estimation algorithm. We demonstrate the advantage of our method in
several benchmark datasets.

the idea that the brain maintains an internal model of the world by minimizing
free energy. From a behavioral perspective, active inference agents can be seen
as self-evidencing beings that act to fulfill their optimistic predictions,
namely preferred outcomes or goals. In contrast, reinforcement learning
requires human-designed rewards to accomplish any desired outcome. Although
active inference could provide a more natural self-supervised objective for
control, its applicability has been limited because of the shortcomings in
scaling the approach to complex environments. In this work, we propose a
contrastive objective for active inference that strongly reduces the
computational burden in learning the agent's generative model and planning
future actions. Our method performs notably better than likelihood-based active
inference in image-based tasks, while also being computationally cheaper and
easier to train. We compare to reinforcement learning agents that have access
to human-designed reward functions, showing that our approach closely matches
their performance. Finally, we also show that contrastive methods perform
significantly better in the case of distractors in the environment and that our
method is able to generalize goals to variations in the background.

the lifting induced by the non-standard kinetic term, an asymptotic de

when dealing with high-resolution images in an extensive database. Quantum
algorithms have been shown to improve the efficiency and speed of many
computational tasks, and as such, they could also potentially improve the
complexity of the face recognition process. Here, we propose a quantum machine
learning algorithm for pattern recognition based on quantum principal component

quantum algorithm for finding dissimilarity in the faces based on the
computation of trace and determinant of a matrix (image) is also proposed. The
overall complexity of our pattern recognition algorithm is O(Nlog N) -- $N$ is
the image dimension. As an input to these pattern recognition algorithms, we
consider experimental images obtained from quantum imaging techniques with
correlated photons, e.g. ""interaction-free"" imaging or ""ghost"" imaging.
Interfacing these imaging techniques with our quantum pattern recognition

lower exposures, and higher resolution, thus speeding up the machine learning

These anti-motion techniques were considered to generate continuous dose
degradation to avoid drastic changes in the delivered doses that involve the
edge regions of the beams. A comparison was made between the delivered and
simulated doses, with and without the presence of motions simulations. This
study demonstrates that techniques without motion management can be affected by
motions that can lead to a difference equal to 19 % between the delivered and
the planned doses in a point located near to the beams collimators edges, and
to a difference up to 3 % on multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) edges (gamma pass
rates were 87.9 % for 3%/3mm). These differences were reduced to 11 % and to
less than 3 % (gamma pass rates were 100 % for 3%/3mm) when MMT were used. As a
conclusion, in tangential techniques motion can affect dose estimations on the
MLCs and beams collimators edges. The proposed MMT reduce this effect to
estimate the delivered dose accurately.

such jets is the subject of intense research, mainly based on the dichotomy
presented by the two main jet launching scenarios $-$ the one from Blandford &
Payne (1982), and the one from Blandford & Znajek (1977). In this work we study
the prominent and nearby radio galaxy 3C 84 (NGC 1275) with 15, 43, and 86 GHz
quasi-simultaneous VLBI observations. From these we determine the jet apex to
be located $83\pm7\,\mu$as ($0.028-0.11$pc) upstream of the 86 GHz VLBI core,
applying a two dimensional cross-correlation analysis. A byproduct of this
analysis are spectral index maps, in which we identify a robust spectral index
gradient in the north-south direction, for the first time at such high
resolution, for the 43-86 GHz pair. The magnetic field strength at distances
from the VLBI core comparable to measurements from the literature ($\sim10$
Schwarzschild radii) for other prominent AGN, like NGC 1052 and M 87, is
computed to be $70-600$G. Implications for the magnetic field topology are also
discussed.

imaging inverse problems. Conventional deep-unrolling methods require full
forward operator and its adjoint across each layer, and hence can be
significantly more expensive computationally as compared with other end-to-end
methods that are based on post-processing of model-based reconstructions,
especially for 3D image reconstruction tasks. We develop a stochastic
(ordered-subsets) variant of the classical learned primal-dual (LPD), which is
a state-of-the-art unrolling network for tomographic image reconstruction. The
proposed learned stochastic primal-dual (LSPD) network only uses subsets of the
forward and adjoint operators and offers considerable computational efficiency.
We provide theoretical analysis of a special case of our LSPD framework,
suggesting that it has the potential to achieve image reconstruction quality
competitive with the full-batch LPD while requiring only a fraction of the
computation. The numerical results for two different X-ray computed tomography
(CT) imaging tasks (namely, low-dose and sparse-view CT) corroborate this
theoretical finding, demonstrating the promise of LSPD networks for large-scale
imaging problems.

environment---is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, even more so than
centralized learning approaches. This is because malicious clients can collude
and send in carefully tailored model updates to make the global model
inaccurate. This motivated the development of Byzantine-resilient federated
learning algorithms, such as Krum, Bulyan, FABA, and FoolsGold. However, a
recently developed untargeted model poisoning attack showed that all prior
defenses can be bypassed. The attack uses the intuition that simply by changing
the sign of the gradient updates that the optimizer is computing, for a set of
malicious clients, a model can be diverted from the optima to increase the test
error rate. In this work, we develop TESSERACT---a defense against this
directed deviation attack, a state-of-the-art model poisoning attack. TESSERACT
is based on a simple intuition that in a federated learning setting, certain
patterns of gradient flips are indicative of an attack. This intuition is
remarkably stable across different learning algorithms, models, and datasets.
TESSERACT assigns reputation scores to the participating clients based on their
behavior during the training phase and then takes a weighted contribution of
the clients. We show that TESSERACT provides robustness against even a
white-box version of the attack.

outperforms the residual dense network (RDN) in terms of PSNR and
block-sensitive PSNR by a margin of +0.1 dB and +0.19 dB, respectively. The
proposed SR system consumes 48% less memory and 67% less peak instantaneous

  Group Testing",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the noisy group testing problem where among a large
population of items some are defective. The goal is to identify all defective
items by testing groups of items, with the minimum possible number of tests.
The focus of this work is on the practical settings with a limited number of
items rather than the asymptotic regime. In the current literature, belief
propagation has been shown to be effective in recovering defective items from
the test results. In this work, we adopt two variants of the belief propagation
algorithm for the noisy group testing problem. These algorithms have been used
successfully in the decoding of low-density parity-check codes. We perform an
experimental study and using extensive simulations we show that these
algorithms achieve higher success probability, lower false-negative, and
false-positive rates compared to the traditional belief propagation algorithm.
For instance, our results show that the proposed algorithms can reduce the
false-negative rate by about $50\%$ (or more) when compared to the traditional
BP algorithm, under the combinatorial model. Moreover, under the probabilistic
model, this reduction in the false-negative rate increases to about $80\%$ for
the tested cases.

analyzed using a filtering approach. Competing effects in the flow are
considered, along with the physical mechanisms governing the energy fluxes
between scales, and the budgets are used to analyze data from direct numerical
simulation (DNS) at buoyancy Reynolds number $Re_b=O(100)$. The mean TKE
exceeds TPE by an order of magnitude at the large scales, with the difference
reducing as $\ell$ is decreased. At larger scales, buoyancy is never observed
to be positive, with buoyancy always converting TKE to TPE. As $\ell$ is
decreased, the probability of locally convecting regions increases, though it
remains small at scales down to the Ozmidov scale. The TKE and TPE fluxes
between scales are both downscale on average and their instantaneous values are
positively correlated, but not strongly so, and this occurs due to the
different physical mechanisms that govern these fluxes. Moreover, the
contribution to these fluxes arising from the sub-grid fields are shown to be
significant, in addition to the filtered scale contributions associated with
the processes of strain-self amplification, vortex stretching, and density
gradient amplification. Probability density functions (PDFs) of the $Q,R$
invariants of the filtered velocity gradient are considered. Unlike isotropic
turbulence, as $\ell$ increases the sheared-drop shape of the PDF disappears
and the PDF becomes symmetric about $R=0$, meaning regions of vortex stretching

relationship whereby the design of the former directly impacts the economic

from opaque efficiency-equity trade-offs and are also agnostic of the

paper develops a justice-cognizant tariff design framework that improves the
economic efficiency of tariff without sacrificing its distributional equity,
and encompasses economic welfare, social costs of environmental and public
health impacts, and socio-economic and demographic characteristics of
electricity consumers. The proposed framework is based on a Single Leader
Single Follower (SLSF) game incorporating a multi-objective optimization
problem, and is evaluated on four different tariff structures. The SLSF game is
reformulated as a Multi-Objective Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (MOPEC)

We compare the economic efficiency and equity of the proposed framework using

to the low data quality observed in PMU measurements and event logs. To address
these challenges, we develop a novel machine learning framework for training
robust event classifiers, which consists of three main steps: data
preprocessing, fine-grained event data extraction, and feature engineering.
Specifically, the data preprocessing step addresses the data quality issues of
PMU measurements (e.g., bad data and missing data); in the fine-grained event
data extraction step, a model-free event detection method is developed to
accurately localize the events from the inaccurate event timestamps in the
event logs; and the feature engineering step constructs the event features
based on the patterns of different event types, in order to improve the
performance and the interpretability of the event classifiers. Based on the
proposed framework, we develop a workflow for event classification using the
real-world PMU data streaming into the system in real-time. Using the proposed
framework, robust event classifiers can be efficiently trained based on many
off-the-shelf lightweight machine learning models. Numerical experiments using

privacy and security of any application that uses browser fingerprinting. The
idea is that attacker A first makes the user U connect to his website (or to a
well-known site the attacker controls) and transparently collects the
information from U that is used for fingerprinting purposes. Then, A
orchestrates a browser on his own machine to replicate and transmit the same
fingerprinting information when connecting to W, fooling W to think that U is
the one requesting the service rather than A. This will allow the attacker to
profile U and compromise U's privacy. We design and implement the Gummy
Browsers attack using three orchestration methods based on script injection,
browser settings and debugging tools, and script modification, that can
successfully spoof a wide variety of fingerprinting features to mimic many
different browsers (including mobile browsers and the Tor browser). We then
evaluate the attack against two state-of-the-art browser fingerprinting
systems, FPStalker and Panopticlick. Our results show that A can accurately
match his own manipulated browser fingerprint with that of any targeted victim

positive rate) for the tracking of the attacker is also high, larger than 0.9
in all cases. We also argue that the attack can remain completely oblivious to

density fluctuations $\sigma_8$ within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with
shear peak statistics and angular convergence power spectra using mass maps
constructed from the first three years of data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES
Y3). We use tomographic shear peak statistics, including cross-peaks: peak
counts calculated on maps created by taking a harmonic space product of the
convergence of two tomographic redshift bins. Our analysis follows a
forward-modelling scheme to create a likelihood of these statistics using
N-body simulations, using a Gaussian process emulator. We include the following
lensing systematics: multiplicative shear bias, photometric redshift
uncertainty, and galaxy intrinsic alignment. Stringent scale cuts are applied
to avoid biases from unmodelled baryonic physics. We find that the additional
non-Gaussian information leads to a tightening of the constraints on the
structure growth parameter yielding
$S_8~\equiv~\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.3}~=~0.797_{-0.013}^{+0.015}$
(68% confidence limits), with a precision of 1.8%, an improvement of ~38%
compared to the angular power spectra only case. The results obtained with the
angular power spectra and peak counts are found to be in agreement with each
other and no significant difference in $S_8$ is recorded. We find a mild
tension of $1.5 \thinspace \sigma$ between our study and the results from
Planck 2018, with our analysis yielding a lower $S_8$. Furthermore, we observe
that the combination of angular power spectra and tomographic peak counts
breaks the degeneracy between galaxy intrinsic alignment $A_{\mathrm{IA}}$ and
$S_8$, improving cosmological constraints. We run a suite of tests concluding
that our results are robust and consistent with the results from other studies
using DES Y3 data.

equation possesses an additional mean field forcing term, which originates from

demonstrated that, in our model, a turbulent gas flow with a Kolmogorov kinetic
energy spectrum develops from an otherwise laminar initial jet. In the current
work, we investigate the possibility of a similar turbulent flow developing in
a large scale two-dimensional setting, where a strong external acceleration
compresses the gas into a relatively thin slab along the third dimension. The
main motivation behind the current work is the following. According to
observations, horizontal turbulent motions in the Earth atmosphere manifest in
a wide range of spatial scales, from hundreds of meters to thousands of
kilometers. Yet, the air density rapidly decays with altitude, roughly by an
order of magnitude each 15-20 kilometers. This naturally raises the question as
to whether or not there exists a dynamical mechanism which can produce large
scale turbulence within a purely two-dimensional gas flow. To our surprise, we
discover that our model indeed produces turbulent flows and the corresponding
Kolmogorov energy spectra in such a two-dimensional setting.

given conditioning such as text, mel-spectrograms, or MIDI. These systems
employ deep generative models that model the waveform via either sequential

adversarial networks (GANs) have become a common choice for non-autoregressive

demonstrate that these artifacts correspond with an inability for the generator
to learn accurate pitch and periodicity. We show that simple pitch and
periodicity conditioning is insufficient for reducing this error relative to
using autoregression. We discuss the inductive bias that autoregression
provides for learning the relationship between instantaneous frequency and
phase, and show that this inductive bias holds even when autoregressively
sampling large chunks of the waveform during each forward pass. Relative to
prior state-of-the-art GAN-based models, our proposed model, Chunked
Autoregressive GAN (CARGAN) reduces pitch error by 40-60%, reduces training

techniques borrowed from particle physics, such as reverse unitarity, reduction
to master integrals by integration-by-parts identities and canonical

data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The survey spans an effective area of
4139 square degrees and uses the images of over 100 million galaxies to
reconstruct the convergence field. The second moment of the convergence as a
function of smoothing scale contains information similar to standard shear
2-point statistics. The third moment, or the skewness, contains additional
non-Gaussian information. The data is analysed in the context of the
$\Lambda$CDM model, varying 5 cosmological parameters and 19 nuisance
parameters modelling astrophysical and measurement systematics. Our modelling
of the observables is completely analytical, and has been tested with
simulations in our previous methodology study. We obtain a 1.7\% measurement of
the amplitude of fluctuations parameter $S_8\equiv \sigma_8
(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.784\pm 0.013$. The measurements are shown to be
internally consistent across redshift bins, angular scales, and between second
and third moments. In particular, the measured third moment is consistent with
the expectation of gravitational clustering under the $\Lambda$CDM model. The
addition of the third moment improves the constraints on $S_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm
m}$ by $\sim$15\% and $\sim$25\% compared to an analysis that only uses second
moments. We compare our results with {\it Planck} constraints from the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB), finding a $2.2$ \textendash $2.8\sigma$ tension in
the full parameter space, depending on the combination of moments considered.
The third moment independently is in $2.8\sigma$ tension with {\it Planck}, and
thus provides a cross-check on analyses of 2-point correlations.

(AQuaDem). The proposed approach consists in learning a discretization of
continuous action spaces from human demonstrations. This discretization returns
a set of plausible actions (in light of the demonstrations) for each input
state, thus capturing the priors of the demonstrator and their multimodal
behavior. By discretizing the action space, any discrete action deep RL
technique can be readily applied to the continuous control problem. Experiments
show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as
SAC in the RL setup, and GAIL in the Imitation Learning setup. We provide a

white dwarf hosts. Because of these small orbital separations, the brown dwarfs
are irradiated at levels similar to hot Jupiters. Yet, they are easier to
observe than hot Jupiters because white dwarfs are fainter than main-sequence
stars at near-infrared wavelengths. Irradiated brown dwarfs are, therefore,
ideal hot Jupiter analogs for studying the atmospheric response under strong
irradiation and fast rotation. We present the 1.1--1.67$\rm \mu m$
spectroscopic phase curve of the irradiated brown dwarf (SDSS1411-B) in the
SDSS J141126.20+200911.1 brown-dwarf white-dwarf binary with the near-infrared
G141 grism of Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. SDSS1411-B is a
$50~\rm M_{\rm Jup}$ brown dwarf with an irradiation temperature of 1300K and
has an orbital period of 2.02864 hours. Our best-fit model suggests a
phase-curve amplitude of 1.4$\%$ and places an upper limit of 11 degrees for
the phase offset from the secondary eclipse. After fitting the white-dwarf
spectrum, we extract the phase-resolved brown-dwarf emission spectra. We report
a highly wavelength-dependent day-night spectral variation, with the water-band
flux variation of about $360\pm70\% $ and a comparatively small J-band flux
variation of $37\pm2\%$. By combining the atmospheric modeling results and the
day-night brightness-temperature variations, we derive a pressure-dependent
temperature contrast. We discuss the difference in the spectral features of
SDSS1411-B and hot Jupiter WASP-43b, and the lower-than-predicted day-night
temperature contrast of J4111-BD. Our study provides the high-precision

demonstrate rotational modulations with semi-amplitudes of $5.27\pm0.02$% and
$29.1\pm0.1$%; both can be well fit by multi-order Fourier series models. The
high-order Fourier components have the same phase as the first order and are
likely caused by hot spots located at the substellar points, suggesting
inefficient day/night heat transfer. Both brown dwarfs' phase-resolved spectra
can be accurately represented by linear combinations of their day- and
night-side spectra. Fitting the irradiated brown dwarf model grids to the
day-side spectra require a filling factor of ~50%, further supporting a hot
spot dominating the emission of the day-sides. The night-side spectrum of WD
0137-349B is reasonably well fit by non-irradiated substellar models and the
one of EPIC 212235321B can be approximated by a Planck function. We find strong
spectral variations in the brown dwarfs' day/night flux and brightness
temperature contrasts, which highlights the limitations of band-integrated
measurements in probing heat transfer in irradiated objects. On the
color-magnitude diagram, WD 0137-349B evolves along a cloudless model track
connecting the early-L and mid-T spectral types, demonstrating that clouds and
disequilibrium chemistry have a negligible effect on this object. A full
interpretation of these high-quality phase-resolved spectra calls for new
models that couple atmospheric circulation and radiative transfer under

weak lensing peak abundance. In this work, we study the clustering of weak
lensing peaks, and present parameter constraint forecasts for an LSST-like
survey. We use the cosmoslics $w$CDM simulations to measure the peak two-point

applied to generate likelihood contours and provide parameter constraint
forecasts from mock observations. We investigate the dependence of the peak
two-point correlation function on the peak height, and find that the clustering
of low amplitude peaks is complementary to that of high amplitude peaks.
Consequently, their combination gives significantly tighter constraints than
the clustering of high peaks alone. The peak two-point correlation function is
significantly more sensitive to the cosmological parameters $h$ and $w_0$ than
the peak abundance, and when the probes are combined, constraints on
$\Omega_{\rm m}$, $S_8$, $h$ and $w_0$ improve by at least a factor of two,
relative to the peak abundance alone. Finally, we compare the forecasts for
weak lensing peaks and weak lensing voids, and show that the two are also

how the presence of loss in repeater stations affect the maximum attainable

quantum networks. Extending the framework of node splitting, we model the loss
introduced at the repeater stations and then prove the corresponding limits. In
the linear chain scenario we show that, by increasing the number of repeater
stations, the maximum rate cannot overcome a quantity which solely depends on
the loss of a single station. We introduce a way of adapting the standard
machinery for obtaining bounds to this realistic scenario. The difference is
that whilst ultimate limits for any strategy can be derived given a fixed
channel, when the repeaters introduce additional decoherence, then the
effective overall channel is itself a function of the chosen repeater strategy
(e.g., one-way versus two-way classical communication). Classes of repeater
strategies can be analysed using additional modelling and the subsequent bounds
can be interpreted as the optimal rate within that class.

their confinement does not imply a trivial gapped vacuum. This paper will offer
three lessons about the confining phases of flux-attached $\mathbb Z_K$
theories in two spatial dimensions. First, on an arbitrary orientable lattice,
flux attachment that satisfies a simple, explicitly derived criterion leads to
a confining theory whose low-energy behavior is captured by an action of a
general Chern-Simons form. Second, on a square lattice, this criterion can be
solved, and all theories that satisfy it can be enumerated. The simplest such
theory has an action given by a difference of two Chern-Simons terms, and it
features a kind of subsystem symmetry that causes its topological entanglement
entropy to behave pathologically. Third, the simplest flux-attached theory on a
square lattice that does not satisfy the above criterion is exactly solvable
when the gauge group is $\mathbb Z_2$. On a torus, its confined phase possesses
a twofold topological degeneracy that stems from a sum over spin structures in
a dual fermionic theory. This makes this flux-attached $\mathbb Z_2$ theory an
appealing candidate for a microscopic description of a $\mathrm U(1)_2$

M_{\rm NS})$. The second, $\tilde{\kappa} = \kappa \dot{M} / \sqrt{G M_{\rm NS}
R_{\rm NS}}$, parameterizes the neutrino optical depth in the accreted matter
near the neutron-star surface. Over the years, many have proposed approximate
explosion conditions: the critical neutrino-luminosity, ante-sonic, and
timescale conditions. We are able to derive these other conditions from the
force explosion condition, which unifies them all. Using numerical,
steady-state and fully hydrodynamic solutions, we test the explosion condition.
The success of these tests is promising in two ways. One, the force explosion
condition helps to illuminate the underlying physics of explosions. Two, this
condition may be a useful explosion diagnostic for more realistic,
three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic core-collapse simulations.

this article we link three main topics: the channels of black hole seed
formation, the journey from seeds to massive black holes, the diagnostics on
the origins of MBHs. We highlight and critically discuss current unsolved

sources, with the current record holder at $z=7.642$. Here, we show how future
detections of $z>8$ quasars impact the constraints on the parameters for black
hole growth and seed models. Using broad flat priors on the growth parameters
(Eddington ratio $\,f_{\rm Edd}$, duty cycle ${\cal D}$, seed mass $M_{\rm
\bullet, seed}$ and radiative efficiency $\epsilon$), we show that the large
uncertainties in their determination decrease by a factor $\sim 5$ when a
quasar's detection redshift goes from $z=9$ to $z=12$. In this high-redshift
regime, $\epsilon$ tends to the lowest value allowed, and the distribution for
$M_{\rm \bullet, seed}$ peaks well inside the heavy seed domain. Remarkably,
two quasars detected at $z > 7$ with low accretion rates (J1243+0100 and
J0313-1806) already tighten the available parameter space, requiring $M_{\rm
\bullet, seed} > 10^{3.5} \,{\rm M_\odot}$ and $\epsilon < 0.1$. The radiative
efficiency is a crucial unknown, with factor $\sim 2$ changes able to modify
the predicted mass by $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude already at $z\sim 9$. The
competing roles of inefficient accretion (decreasing $\epsilon$) and black hole
spin-up (increasing $\epsilon$) significantly impact growth models. Finally, we
suggest that yields currently predicted by upcoming quasar surveys (e.g.,
Euclid) will be instrumental for determining the most-likely seed mass regime.
For example, assuming thin-disk accretion, a detection of a quasar with
$M_\bullet \sim 10^{10} \,{\rm M_\odot}$ by $z\sim 9-10$ would exclude the
entire parameter space available for light seeds and dramatically reduce the
one for heavy seeds.

solutions which are both superextremal and self-attractive. Furthermore, we
present examples where no choice of higher-derivative coefficients allows for
self-repulsive black hole states in all directions in charge space. This

reason for its asymmetry and the origin of this SNR, we performed a spatially
resolved X-ray spectroscopic analysis of XMM-Newton and Chandra observation
data. We divided the SNR into 13 regions and analyzed the spectra using
two-temperature models (0.2 keV + 1 keV). Compared to the southwestern regions,
the northeastern regions have higher metal abundances and a lower gas density.
This suggests that the asymmetric morphology results from the non-uniform
ambient environment. We found that neither Type Ia nor core-collapse SN models
can account for the abnormally high abundance ratios of Ar/Si, Ca/Si, or the
shape of the abundance curve. A comparison with the Ca-rich transient models
shows that G306.3$-$0.9 is likely to be the first identified Galactic ""Ca-rich

We also note that the conclusion for the SNR's origin relies on the measured
abundance ratios and existing nucleosynthesis models. Between two groups of

concentrate on pure angular systematics and describe an alternative approach
consisting in analysing the galaxy two-point correlation function where angular
modes are nulled. By construction, this procedure removes all possible known

angular positions are randomly drawn from the galaxy catalogue, and provide an
analytical model to describe this modified statistic. We test the model by
performing an analysis of the full anisotropic clustering in mock catalogues of
luminous red and emission-line galaxies at 0.43 < z < 1.1. We find that the
model fully accounts for the modified correlation function in redshift space,
without introducing new nuisance parameters. The derived cosmological

Spectral Library (XSL) from NUV to NIR wavelengths. The unmatched
characteristics of relatively high resolution and extended wavelength coverage
($350-2480$ nm, $R\sim10\,000$) of the XSL population models bring us closer to
bridging optical and NIR studies of intermediate and old stellar populations.
It is now common to find good agreement between observed and predicted NUV and
optical properties of stellar clusters due to our good understanding of the
main-sequence and early giant phases of stars. However, NIR spectra of
intermediate-age and old stellar populations are sensitive to cool K and M
giants. The asymptotic giant branch, especially the thermally pulsing
asymptotic giant branch, shapes the NIR spectra of $0.5-2$ Gyr old stellar
populations; the tip of the red giant branch defines the NIR spectra of
populations with ages larger than that. We construct sequences of the average
spectra of static giants, variable-rich giants, and C-rich giants to include in
the models separately. The models span the metallicity range $-2.2<[Fe/H]<+0.2$
and ages above 50 Myr, a broader range in the NIR than in other models based on
empirical spectral libraries. Our models can reproduce the integrated optical
colours of the Coma cluster galaxies at the same level as other semi-empirical
models found in the literature. In the NIR, there are notable differences
between the colours of the models and Coma cluster galaxies. The XSL models
expand the range of predicted values of NIR indices compared to other models
based on empirical libraries. Our models make it possible to perform in-depth
studies of colours and spectral features consistently throughout the optical
and the NIR range to clarify the role of evolved cool stars in stellar
populations.

immediately next to treatment (an inner-ring) to units just slightly further

average treatment effect among the affected units and illustrates pitfalls that
occur when these assumptions fail. Since one of these assumptions requires
knowledge of exactly how far treatment effects are experienced, I propose a new
method that relaxes this assumption and allows for nonparametric estimation
using partitioning-based least squares developed in Cattaneo et. al. (2019).
Since treatment effects typically decay/change over distance, this estimator
improves analysis by estimating a treatment effect curve as a function of
distance from treatment. This is contrast to the traditional method which, at
best, identifies the average effect of treatment. To illustrate the advantages
of this method, I show that Linden and Rockoff (2008) under estimate the
effects of increased crime risk on home values closest to the treatment and
overestimate how far the effects extend by selecting a treatment ring that is

iterative strategy, however, ICP-based method easily falls into local optima,
which in turn calls for a precise initialization. In this paper, we propose
CoFi, a Coarse-to-Fine ICP algorithm for LiDAR localization. Specifically, the
proposed algorithm down-samples the input point sets under multiple voxel
resolution, and gradually refines the transformation from the coarse point sets
to the fine-grained point sets. In addition, we propose a map based LiDAR
localization algorithm that extracts semantic feature points from the LiDAR

the proposed CoFi localization algorithm demonstrates the state-of-the-art

identify physicochemically meaningful descriptors, or materials genes, which
are engineered from primary variables and a set of elementary algebraic
operators through compositions. Standard practice directly analyzes the
high-dimensional candidate predictor space in a linear model; statistical
analyses are then substantially hampered by the daunting challenge posed by the
astronomically large number of correlated predictors with limited sample size.
We formulate this problem as variable selection with operator-induced structure
(OIS), and propose a new method to achieve unconventional dimension reduction
by utilizing the geometry embedded in OIS. Although the model remains linear,
we iterate nonparametric variable selection for effective dimension reduction.
This enables variable selection based on ab initio primary variables, leading
to a method that is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, with
improved accuracy. An OIS screening property for variable selection with OIS is
introduced; interestingly, finite sample assessment indicates that the employed
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)-based variable selection method
enjoys this property under the simulation settings. Numerical studies show the
superiority of the proposed method, which continues to exhibit robust
performance when the dimension of engineered features is out of reach of
existing methods. Our analysis to single-atom catalysis identifies physical
descriptors that explain the binding energy of metal-support pairs with high
explanatory power, leading to interpretable insights to guide the prevention of

discoveries and operations research as well as many commercial applications. A
commonly used metric to compare meta-heuristic solvers is the time required to

applications it is desirable to have a set of high-quality and diverse
solutions, instead of a single optimal one. For these applications, time to
solution may not be informative of the performance of a solver, and another
metric would be necessary. In particular, it is not known how well quantum
solvers sample the configuration space in comparison to their classical
counterparts. Here, we apply a recently introduced collective distance measure
in solution space to quantify diversity by Mohseni et. al. and, based on that,
we employ time-to-diversity as a metric for evaluation of meta-heuristics
solvers. We use this measure to compare the performance of the D-Wave quantum
annealing processor with a few classical heuristic solvers on a set of
synthetic problems and show that D-Wave quantum annealing processor is indeed a
competitive heuristic, and on many instances outperforms state-of-the-art
classical solvers, while it remains on par on other instances. This suggests
that a portfolio solver that combines quantum and classical solutions may win

electron-hole exchange interaction splits the exciton dispersion into a massive
transverse branch, and a longitudinal branch that has very light or even zero
mass depending on the form of screened Coulomb interaction. The group velocity
of the longitudinal branch is sensitive to the strength of electron-hole
exchange, which can be engineered through the dielectric environment. Here we
show that dielectric patterning of the substrate can be exploited to realize
waveguide of the exciton in the longitudinal branch in a homogeneous monolayer,
leaving the massive transverse branch unaffected. At a lateral interface of
different dielectric constant in the substrate, the transmission and reflection
of exciton in the longitudinal branch obey the Snell-Descartes law of optical
system, and total reflection can be exploited to realize excitonic waveguide
using two parallel interfaces. The same dielectric pattern of the substrate
appears to be completely transparent for the massive transverse branch exciton,
which has no interface scattering. When the monolayer is placed on a
one-dimensional dielectric superlattice, the dispersion of the longitudinal
branch is strongly renormalized, and the wavefunctions exhibit one-dimensional
features, confined to either the low-dielectric or high-dielectric regions. In
contrast, the massive transverse branch excitons are not affected by the
substrate dielectric pattern, exhibiting pristine properties as in a

respect the symmetries in the selected group, and lead to better generalization
when these symmetries appear in the data. If this is not the case, however,
equivariance leads to overly constrained models and worse performance.
Frequently, transformations occurring in data can be better represented by a
subset of a group than by a group as a whole, e.g., rotations in $[-90^{\circ},
90^{\circ}]$. In such cases, a model that respects equivariance
$\textit{partially}$ is better suited to represent the data. In addition,
relevant transformations may differ for low and high-level features. For
instance, full rotation equivariance is useful to describe edge orientations in
a face, but partial rotation equivariance is better suited to describe face
poses relative to the camera. In other words, the optimal level of equivariance
may differ per layer. In this work, we introduce $\textit{Partial G-CNNs}$:
G-CNNs able to learn layer-wise levels of partial and full equivariance to
discrete, continuous groups and combinations thereof as part of training.
Partial G-CNNs retain full equivariance when beneficial, e.g., for rotated
MNIST, but adjust it whenever it becomes harmful, e.g., for classification of 6
/ 9 digits or natural images. We empirically show that partial G-CNNs pair
G-CNNs when full equivariance is advantageous, and outperform them otherwise.

methodology extends existing causal frameworks and methods, specifically,
two-staged randomized experiments and the principal stratification framework.
In contrast to existing methods that invoke strong structural assumptions to
identify principal causal effects, our Bayesian approach uses flexible
distributional models that can accommodate the complexities of interference and
missing outcomes, and that ensure that principal causal effects are weakly
identifiable. We illustrate our methodology via simulation studies and a
re-analysis of real-life data from an evaluation of India's National Health

effects that were not identified in past analyses. Ultimately, our simulation
studies and case study demonstrate how our methodology can yield more

neural networks are often constrained by both latency and power consumption.
This places a limit on the devices, particularly low-power edge devices, that
can employ these methods. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be
the third generation of artificial neural networks which aim to address these
latency and power constraints by taking inspiration from biological neuronal
communication processes. Before data such as images can be input into an SNN,
however, they must be first encoded into spike trains. Herein, we propose a
method for encoding static images into temporal spike trains using edge
detection and an adaptive signal sampling method for use in SNNs. The edge
detection process consists of first performing Canny edge detection on the 2D
static images and then converting the edge detected images into two X and Y
signals using an image-to-signal conversion method. The adaptive signaling
approach consists of sampling the signals such that the signals maintain enough
detail and are sensitive to abrupt changes in the signal. Temporal encoding
mechanisms such as threshold-based representation (TBR) and step-forward (SF)
are then able to be used to convert the sampled signals into spike trains. We
use various error and indicator metrics to optimize and evaluate the efficiency
and precision of the proposed image encoding approach. Comparison results
between the original and reconstructed signals from spike trains generated
using edge-detection and adaptive temporal encoding mechanism exhibit 18x and
7x reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the
conventional SF and TBR encoding, respectively, while used for encoding MNIST
dataset.

paper, we develop a power line sensing technique that can detect various types
of cable anomalies without any prior domain knowledge. To this end, we design a

achieved using a variety of neural network architectures ranging from fully
connected neural networks (FCNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
general adversarial networks (GANs). However most of these approaches are
working with optimizations considering image level losses and hence require a
significant amount of dataset to ensure that the process of beamforming is

where the delay compensated radio frequency (RF) patch for a fixed region in
space (e.g. 32x32) is transformed through a U-Net architecture and multiplied
with DAS apodization weights and optimized for similarity with MVDR image of
the patch. Instead of framing the beamforming problem as a regression problem
to estimate the apodization weights, the proposed approach treats the
non-linear transformation of the RF data space that can account for the data
driven weight adaptation done by the MVDR approach in the parameters of the
network. In this way, it is also observed that by restricting the input to a
patch the model will learn the beamforming pipeline as an image non-linear
transformation problem.

between these quasi-periods are interpreted assuming that the variability
arises due to a helical structure of the jet, which is preserved from regions
near the jet base to at least 1 milliarcsecond from the core observed in radio
interferometric observations. The radiating jet components should display
radial motions with Lorentz factors of $\approx3$, and decelerate with distance

evolution raises major challenges, in particular related to the appropriate
distribution of computing elements along an edge-to-cloud continuum. About
this, Federated Learning has been recently proposed for distributed model
training in the edge. The principle of this approach is to aggregate models
learned on distributed clients in order to obtain a new, more general model.
The resulting model is then redistributed to clients for further training. To
date, the most popular federated learning algorithm uses coordinate-wise
averaging of the model parameters for aggregation. However, it has been shown
that this method is not adapted in heterogeneous environments where data is not
identically and independently distributed (non-iid). This corresponds directly
to some pervasive computing scenarios where heterogeneity of devices and users
challenges machine learning with the double objective of generalization and
personalization. In this paper, we propose a novel aggregation algorithm,
termed FedDist, which is able to modify its model architecture (here, deep
neural network) by identifying dissimilarities between specific neurons amongst
the clients. This permits to account for clients' specificity without impairing
generalization. Furthermore, we define a complete method to evaluate federated
learning in a realistic way taking generalization and personalization into
account.
  Using this method, FedDist is extensively tested and compared with three

Processing. Process Mining concerns discovering insights on business processes
from their execution data that are logged by supporting information systems.
The logged data (event log) is formed of event sequences (traces) that
correspond to executions of a process. Many Deep Learning techniques have been
successfully adapted for predictive Process Mining that aims to predict process
outcomes, remaining time, the next event, or even the suffix of running traces.
Traces in Process Mining are multimodal sequences and very differently
structured than natural language sentences or images. This may require a
different approach to processing. So far, there has been little focus on these
differences and the challenges introduced. Looking at suffix prediction as the
most challenging of these tasks, the performance of Deep Learning models was
evaluated only on average measures and for a small number of real-life event

pre-processing and evaluation strategies. Challenges that may be relevant are
the skewness of trace-length distribution and the skewness of the activity
distribution in real-life event logs. We provide an end-to-end framework which

intensity present in both compounds near $Q$ = 1.0 $\r{A}^{-1}$. The excitation
is nearly indistinguishable from another excitation observed in the
structurally related superconducting compound K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$, which has been
interpreted as magnetic in origin and related to Fermi surface nesting.
However, the calculated Fermi surface of K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ differs
substantially from the $A_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ compounds, and many consider them
distinct classes of materials. Nevertheless, the new observation is most
consistent with a magnetic origin, linking the physics of both classes. These
findings suggest that the selenide and arsenide compounds are more closely
related than originally thought, with properties falling on the same continuum.

the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease. The ability of STN cells to generate
bursting rhythms under either transient or sustained hyperpolarization may
underlie the excessively synchronous beta rhythms observed in Parkinson's
disease. In this study, we developed a conductance-based single compartment
model of an STN neuron, which is able to generate characteristic activity
patterns observed in experiments including hyperpolarization-induced bursts and
post-inhibitory rebound bursts. This study focused on the role of three
currents in rhythm generation: T-type calcium (CaT) current, L-type calcium
(CaL) current, and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN)
current. To investigate the effects of these currents in rhythm generation, we
performed a bifurcation analysis using slow variables in these currents.
Bifurcation analysis showed that the HCN current promotes single-spike activity
patterns rather than bursting in agreement with experimental results. It also
showed that the CaT current is necessary for characteristic bursting activity
patterns. In particular, the CaT current enables STN neurons to generate these
activity patterns under hyperpolarizing stimuli. The CaL current enriches and
reinforces these characteristic activity patterns. In hyperpolarization-induced
bursts or post-inhibitory rebound bursts, the CaL current allows STN neurons to
generate long bursting patterns. Thus, bifurcation analysis explained the
synergistic interaction of the CaT and CaL currents, which enables STN neurons
to respond to hyperpolarizing stimuli in a salient way. The results of this
study implicate the importance of CaT and CaL currents in the pathophysiology
of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease.

health over short-term wealth accumulation during a pandemic. Agents are
connected through a weighted undirected network of contacts, and the planner's
objective is to determine the policy that contains the spread of infection
below a tolerable incidence level, and that maximizes the present discounted
value of real income, in that order of priority. The optimal unique policy
depends both on the configuration of the contact network and the tolerable
infection incidence. Comparative statics analyses are conducted: (i) they
reveal the tradeoff between the economic cost of the pandemic and the infection
incidence allowed; and (ii) they suggest a correlation between different
measures of network centrality and individual lockdown probability with the
correlation increasing with the tolerable infection incidence level. Using
unique data on the networks of nursing and long-term homes in the U.S., we
calibrate our model at the state level and estimate the tolerable COVID-19
infection incidence level. We find that laissez-faire (more tolerance to the
virus spread) pandemic policy is associated with an increased number of deaths
in nursing homes and higher state GDP growth. In terms of the death count,
laissez-faire is more harmful to nursing homes than more peripheral in the
networks, those located in deprived counties, and those who work for a profit.
We also find that U.S. states with a Republican governor have a higher level of
tolerable incidence, but policies tend to converge with high death count.

devices show potential as the critical link between quantum information
contained at frequencies as disparate as those in the optical and microwave
domains, thus enabling applications such as long distance networking of
superconducting quantum computers. However, the requirements on the operating
parameters of the transducers necessary to achieve quantum operation have yet
to be characterized. In this work we find simple, explicit expressions for the
necessary and sufficient conditions under which doubly-parametric transducers
in the resolved-sideband, steady-state limit are capable of entangling optical
and microwave modes. Our analysis treats the transducer as a two-mode bosonic
Gaussian channel capable of both beamsplitter-type and two-mode squeezing-type
interactions between optical and microwave modes. For the beamsplitter-type
interaction, we find parameter thresholds which distinguish regions of the
channel's separability, capacity for bound entanglement, and capacity for
distillable entanglement. By contrast, the two-mode squeezing-type interaction
always produces distillable entanglement with no restrictions on temperature,
cooperativities, or losses. Finally, we find the entanglement breaking
conditions on the reduced one-mode upconversion and downconversion channels
obtained by initializing the unused input with vacuum while ignoring the unused
output. These differences between the entanglement thresholds of the
beamsplitter-type and two-mode squeezing-type interactions are then important
considerations in the construction of larger quantum networks that integrate

reasonable performance. The experimental results on both simulated and real

  Spatiotemporal Dynamics","Published at NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are the mathematical tool
of choice for modelling spatiotemporal PDE-dynamics under the influence of
randomness. Based on the notion of mild solution of an SPDE, we introduce a
novel neural architecture to learn solution operators of PDEs with (possibly
stochastic) forcing from partially observed data. The proposed Neural SPDE
model provides an extension to two popular classes of physics-inspired
architectures. On the one hand, it extends Neural CDEs and variants --
continuous-time analogues of RNNs -- in that it is capable of processing
incoming sequential information arriving at arbitrary spatial resolutions. On
the other hand, it extends Neural Operators -- generalizations of neural
networks to model mappings between spaces of functions -- in that it can
parameterize solution operators of SPDEs depending simultaneously on the
initial condition and a realization of the driving noise. By performing
operations in the spectral domain, we show how a Neural SPDE can be evaluated
in two ways, either by calling an ODE solver (emulating a spectral Galerkin
scheme), or by solving a fixed point problem. Experiments on various semilinear
SPDEs, including the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrate how the
Neural SPDE model is capable of learning complex spatiotemporal dynamics in a
resolution-invariant way, with better accuracy and lighter training data
requirements compared to alternative models, and up to 3 orders of magnitude
faster than traditional solvers.

carried out through the plenary roll call votes of this legislative chamber. In
addition, parliamentary electoral behavior is operationalized by implementing
the one-dimensional standard Bayesian ideal point estimator via the Markov

political space dimensionality and the identification of pivot legislators. The
pattern revealed by the estimated ideal points suggests a latent
non-ideological trait (opposition - non-opposition) underlying the vote of
deputies in the Senate. Thus, in addition to providing empirical evidence for a
better understanding of legislative policy in Colombia during the period under

the analysis of roll call vote data in contexts of unbalanced parliaments (as

robots not only will need to adapt their existing manipulation skills to new

great promise of continual learning is to endow robots with this ability, by
using their accumulated knowledge and experience from prior skills. We take a
fresh look at this problem, by considering a setting in which the robot is
limited to storing that knowledge and experience only in the form of learned
skill policies. We show that storing skill policies, careful pre-training, and
appropriately choosing when to transfer those skill policies is sufficient to
build a continual learner in the context of robotic manipulation. We analyze
which conditions are needed to transfer skills in the challenging Meta-World

relating skills that allows us to predict the effectiveness of skill transfer
between tasks, and use it to reduce the problem of continual learning to
curriculum selection. Given an appropriate curriculum, we show how to
continually acquire robotic manipulation skills without forgetting, and using
far fewer samples than needed to train them from scratch.

Hubble cosmic flow. In the two scalar field models we explore the possibility
of combining an axion and a Higgs-like field as well as a Higgs-like field and
the classical field, we show that in the first case there is no set of
parameters that allows us to be consistent with $N_\mathrm{eff}$, while in the
second case a strong restriction to the set of parameters is obtained. This
last restriction is given in terms of a maximum bound of the fraction of

Predicting the probability density function (pdf) of such classifiers in the
multivariate space covering the relevant experimental features is usually
challenging. The detailed simulation of the detector response from first
principles cannot provide the reliability needed for the most precise physics
measurements. Data-driven modelling is usually preferred, though sometimes
limited by the available data size and different coverage of the feature space
by the control channels. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach to the

Mixture Model, whose parameters are predicted by Multi Layer Perceptrons
trained on calibration data. As a proof of principle, the method is applied to
the data acquired by the LHCb experiment in its fixed-target configuration. The
model is trained on a data sample of proton-neon collisions and applied to
smaller data samples of proton-helium and proton-argon collisions collected at
different centre-of-mass energies. The method is shown to perform better than a
detailed simulation-based approach, to be fast and suitable to be applied to a

Clusters of cells can sense gradients more accurately than individual cells by

maximum likelihood estimation to study gradient sensing accuracy of a cluster
of cells with finite positional information. If cells must estimate their
location within the cluster, this lowers the accuracy of collective gradient
sensing. We compare our results with a tug-of-war model where cells respond to
the gradient by a mechanism of collective guidance without relying on their
positional information. As the cell positional uncertainty increases, there is
a trade-off where the tug-of-war model responds more accurately to the chemical
gradient. However, for sufficiently large cell clusters or shallow chemical
gradients, the tug-of-war model will always be suboptimal to one that
integrates information from all cells, even if positional uncertainty is high.

assumptions. One identifiability condition is the positivity assumption, which
requires the probability of treatment be bounded away from 0 and 1. That is,
for every covariate combination, it should be possible to observe both treated
and control subjects, i.e., the covariate distributions should overlap between
treatment arms. If the positivity assumption is violated, population-level
causal inference necessarily involves some extrapolation. Ideally, a greater
amount of uncertainty about the causal effect estimate should be reflected in
such situations. With that goal in mind, we construct a Gaussian process model
for estimating treatment effects in the presence of practical violations of
positivity. Advantages of our method include minimal distributional
assumptions, a cohesive model for estimating treatment effects, and more
uncertainty associated with areas in the covariate space where there is less

angular momentum to the star at the expense of the orbit, where friction within
the star converts the mechanical energy into heat. During the inspiral these
effects are potentially detectable. Different treatments have been used to
estimate the transfer of the mechanical energy and the size of the tidal
friction, leading to different conclusions about the importance of pre-merger
tidal effects. The present work is dedicated to the study of the effect of
temperature on the tidal deformability of neutron stars during the inspiral of
a neutron star system just before the merger. We applied a class of hot
equations of state originated from various nuclear models and found that even
for low values of temperature ($T<1$ MeV) the effects on the basic ingredients
of tidal deformability are not negligible. However, according to the main
finding, the effect of the temperature on the tidal deformability is
indistinguishable. The consequences of this unexpected result are discussed and
analyzed.

With the help of both the adiabatic-impulse model and Floquet numerical

both in fast- and slow-passage limit in the real experiment parameter regions.
In addition, the dephasing effect caused by the system temperature can be

to significantly lower the expensive cost associated with collecting ground

helpful to many pre-harvest decisions. In this study, we propose a new approach
that can effectively transfer knowledge about the topology (i.e. relative
position) of different crop types in the spectral feature space (e.g. the
histogram of SWIR1 vs RDEG1 bands) to generate labels, thereby support crop
classification in a different year. Importantly, our approach does not attempt
to transfer classification decision boundaries that are susceptible to
inter-annual variations of weather and management, but relies on the more
robust and shift-invariant topology information. We tested this approach for
mapping corn/soybeans in the US Midwest and paddy rice/corn/soybeans in
Northeast China using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data. Results show that our
approach automatically generates high-quality labels for crops in the target
year immediately after each image becomes available. Based on these generated
labels from our approach, the subsequent crop type mapping using a random
forest classifier reach the F1 score as high as 0.887 for corn as early as the
silking stage and 0.851 for soybean as early as the flowering stage and the
overall accuracy of 0.873 in Iowa. In Northeast China, F1 scores of paddy rice,
corn and soybeans and the overall accuracy can exceed 0.85 two and half months
ahead of harvest. Overall, these results highlight unique advantages of our
approach in transferring historical knowledge and maximizing the timeliness of
crop maps. Our approach supports a general paradigm shift towards learning
transferrable and generalizable knowledge to facilitate land cover
classification.

succeed on any low-rank matrix optimization problems with a low
information-theoretic complexity, i.e., polynomial-time solvable problems that

of low-rank matrix optimization problems without the RIP condition. We
construct an instance of polynomial-time solvable MC problems with
exponentially many spurious local minima, which leads to the failure of most

optimization problems based on the B-M factorization approach. In addition, we
show that more measurements of the ground truth matrix can deteriorate the

performance in these programs: redundant random variables -- variables with
repeated parameters and inconsistent path conditions. We develop a new program

Test time attacks, usually launched by adding adversarial noise to test

practice, one test input may be leveraged by different ML models. Test time
attacks targeting a single ML model often neglect their impact on other ML
models. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that naively attacking the
classifier learning one concept may negatively impact classifiers trained to
learn other concepts. For example, for the online image classification
scenario, when the Gender classifier is under attack, the (wearing) Glasses
classifier is simultaneously attacked with the accuracy dropped from 98.69 to
88.42. This raises an interesting question: is it possible to attack one set of
classifiers without impacting the other set that uses the same test instance?
Answers to the above research question have interesting implications for
protecting privacy against ML model misuse. Attacking ML models that pose
unnecessary risks of privacy invasion can be an important tool for protecting
individuals from harmful privacy exploitation. In this paper, we address the
above research question by developing novel attack techniques that can
simultaneously attack one set of ML models while preserving the accuracy of the
other. In the case of linear classifiers, we provide a theoretical framework

of a minimal measurable length and/or a maximum measurable momentum near the
Planck scale. When embedded into the framework of quantum mechanics, such
constraints induce a modification of the canonical commutation relations and
thus a generalization of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, commonly
referred to as generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). Different models of
quantum gravity imply different forms of the GUP. For instance, in the
framework of string theory the GUP is quadratic in the momentum operator, while
in the context of doubly special relativity it includes an additional linear
dependence. Among the possible physical consequences, it was recently shown
that the quadratic GUP induces a universal decoherence mechanism, provided one
assumes a foamy structure of quantum spacetime close to the Planck length.
Along this line, in the present work we investigate the gravitational
decoherence associated to the linear-quadratic GUP and we compare it with the
one associated to the quadratic GUP. We find that, despite their similarities,
the two generalizations of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle yield
decoherence times that are completely uncorrelated and significantly distinct.
Motivated by this result, we introduce a theoretical and experimental scheme
based on cavity optomechanics to measure the different time evolution of
nonlocal quantum correlations corresponding to the two aforementioned
decoherence mechanisms. We find that the deviation between the two predictions
occurs on time scales that are macroscopic and thus potentially amenable to
experimental verification. This scenario provides a possible setting to
discriminate between different forms of the GUP and therefore different models

(i.e., hammering) a DRAM row can cause bit flips in physically nearby rows. The
RowHammer vulnerability worsens as DRAM cell size and cell-to-cell spacing
shrink. Recent studies demonstrate that modern DRAM chips, including chips
previously marketed as RowHammer-safe, are even more vulnerable to RowHammer
than older chips such that the required hammer count to cause a bit flip has
reduced by more than 10X in the last decade. Therefore, it is essential to
develop a better understanding and in-depth insights into the RowHammer
vulnerability of modern DRAM chips to more effectively secure current and
future systems.
  Our goal in this paper is to provide insights into fundamental properties of
the RowHammer vulnerability that are not yet rigorously studied by prior works,
but can potentially be $i$) exploited to develop more effective RowHammer
attacks or $ii$) leveraged to design more effective and efficient defense
mechanisms. To this end, we present an experimental characterization using
248~DDR4 and 24~DDR3 modern DRAM chips from four major DRAM manufacturers
demonstrating how the RowHammer effects vary with three fundamental properties:
1)~DRAM chip temperature, 2)~aggressor row active time, and 3)~victim DRAM
cell's physical location. Among our 16 new observations, we highlight that a
RowHammer bit flip 1)~is very likely to occur in a bounded range, specific to
each DRAM cell (e.g., 5.4% of the vulnerable DRAM cells exhibit errors in the
range 70C to 90C), 2)~is more likely to occur if the aggressor row is active
for longer time (e.g., RowHammer vulnerability increases by 36% if we keep a
DRAM row active for 15 column accesses), and 3)~is more likely to occur in
certain physical regions of the DRAM module under attack (e.g., 5% of the rows
are 2x more vulnerable than the remaining 95% of the rows).

fault-tolerant quantum error-correcting codes the cost of implementing the

determine T-count of any $n$-qubit ($n\geq 1$) unitary $W$ of size $2^n\times
2^n$, over the Clifford+T gate set. The space and time complexity of our
algorithm are $O\left(2^{2n}\right)$ and
$O\left(2^{2n\mathcal{T}_{\epsilon}(W)+4n}\right)$ respectively.
$\mathcal{T}_{\epsilon}(W)$ ($\epsilon$-T-count) is the (minimum possible)

that $d(U,W)\leq\epsilon$ and $\mathcal{T}(U)\leq\mathcal{T}(U')$ where $U'$ is
any exactly implementable unitary with $d(U',W)\leq\epsilon$. $d(.,.)$ is the
global phase invariant distance. Our algorithm can also be used to determine
the (minimum possible) T-depth of any multi-qubit unitary and the complexity
has exponential dependence on $n$ and $\epsilon$-T-depth. This is the first
algorithm that gives T-count or T-depth of any multi-qubit ($n\geq 1$) unitary.
For small enough $\epsilon$, we can synthesize the T-count and T-depth-optimal
circuits. Our results can be used to determine the minimum count (or depth) of
non-Clifford gates required to implement any multi-qubit unitary with a
universal gate set consisting of Clifford and non-Clifford gates like
Clifford+CS, Clifford+V, etc. To the best of our knowledge, there were no such

approximate $f$? Recent works examine this basic question on neural network
\textit{expressivity} from the lens of dynamical systems and provide novel
``depth-vs-width'' tradeoffs for a large family of functions $f$. They suggest
that such tradeoffs are governed by the existence of \textit{periodic} points
or \emph{cycles} in $f$. Our work, by further deploying dynamical systems
concepts, illuminates a more subtle connection between periodicity and
expressivity: we prove that periodic points alone lead to suboptimal
depth-width tradeoffs and we improve upon them by demonstrating that certain
``chaotic itineraries'' give stronger exponential tradeoffs, even in regimes
where previous analyses only imply polynomial gaps. Contrary to prior works,
our bounds are nearly-optimal, tighten as the period increases, and handle
strong notions of inapproximability (e.g., constant $L_1$ error). More broadly,
we identify a phase transition to the \textit{chaotic regime} that exactly
coincides with an abrupt shift in other notions of function complexity,
including VC-dimension and topological entropy.

be carried out to the fullest possible extent. Some examples include the
Current Population Survey and National Crime Victimization Survey both
conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the National Survey of Family Growth
conducted by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research.
Clearly, the fine stratification survey has proved useful in many applications
as its point estimator is unbiased and efficient. A common practice to estimate
the variance in this context is collapsing the adjacent strata to create
pseudo-strata and then estimating the variance, but the attained estimator of
variance is not design-unbiased, and the bias increases as the population means
of the pseudo-strata become more variant. Additionally, the estimator may
suffer from a large mean squared error (MSE). In this paper, we propose a
hierarchical Bayesian estimator for the variance of collapsed strata and
compare the results with a nonparametric Bayes variance estimator.
Additionally, we make comparisons with a kernel-based variance estimator
recently proposed by Breidt et al. (2016). We show our proposed estimator is
superior compared to the alternatives given in the literature such that it has
a smaller frequentist MSE and bias. We verify this throughout multiple
simulation studies and data analysis from the 2007-8 National Health and

we investigate the time integration requirements that allow meaningful
reporting of the statistical error associated with finiteness of the temporal
domain. We address two key questions: 1) What is the appropriate range of
sampling frequency in large eddy time units? and 2) How long should a
simulation be performed in terms of large eddy time so that the statistical
error could be reliably reported. Our results indicate that proper sampling
frequency is on the order of 10 large eddy time scale. More importantly, we
find that reliable reporting of statistical errors requires simulation
durations orders of magnitude longer than typically performed. Our observations

Inspired by recent success of self-supervised learning (SSL), we develop a
non-contrastive representation learning method that can exploit additional
knowledge. This additional knowledge may come from annotated labels in the
supervised setting or an SSL model from another modality in the SSL setting.
Our main idea is to generalize the mean-shift algorithm by constraining the
search space of nearest neighbors, resulting in semantically purer
representations. Our method simply pulls the embedding of an instance closer to
its nearest neighbors in a search space that is constrained using the
additional knowledge. By leveraging this non-contrastive loss, we show that the
supervised ImageNet-1k pretraining with our method results in better transfer
performance as compared to the baselines. Further, we demonstrate that our
method is relatively robust to label noise. Finally, we show that it is
possible to use the noisy constraint across modalities to train self-supervised

direction is relevant to floating offshore wind turbines, kite-mounted airborne
wind turbines, and other non-traditional wind-energy systems. To study this
problem experimentally, measurements of torque, rotor speed, and power were
acquired for a horizontal-axis wind turbine actuated in periodic surge motions
in a fan-array wind tunnel at the Caltech Center for Autonomous Systems and
Technologies (CAST). Experiments were conducted at a diameter-based Reynolds
number of $Re_D=6.1\times10^5$ and at tip-speed ratios between 5.2 and 8.8.
Sinusoidal and trapezoidal surge-velocity waveforms with maximum surge
velocities up to 23% of the free-stream velocity were tested. A model in the
form of a linear ordinary differential equation (first-order in time) was
derived to capture the time-resolved dynamics of the surging turbine. Its
coefficients were obtained using torque measurements from a stationary turbine,
without the need for unsteady calibrations. Its predictions compared favorably
with the measured amplitude- and phase-response data. Furthermore, increases in
the period-averaged power of up to 6.4% above the steady reference case were
observed in the experiments at high tip-speed ratios and surge velocities,
potentially due to unsteady or nonlinear aerodynamic effects. Conversely,
decreases in mean power with increased surge velocity at low tip-speed ratios
were likely a result of the onset of stall on the turbine blades. These results
inform the development of strategies to optimize and control the unsteady power
generation of periodically surging wind turbines, and motivate further
investigations into the unsteady aerodynamics of wind-energy systems.

computational knowledge. It is motivated by the observation that most problems
in Computational Sciences and Engineering (CSE) can be formulated as that of
completing (from data) a computational graph (or hypergraph) representing
dependencies between functions and variables. Nodes represent variables, and
edges represent functions. Functions and variables may be known, unknown, or
random. Data comes in the form of observations of distinct values of a finite
number of subsets of the variables of the graph (satisfying its functional
dependencies). The underlying problem combines a regression problem
(approximating unknown functions) with a matrix completion problem (recovering
unobserved variables in the data). Replacing unknown functions by Gaussian
Processes (GPs) and conditioning on observed data provides a simple but
efficient approach to completing such graphs. Since this completion process can
be reduced to an algorithm, as one solves $\sqrt{2}$ on a pocket calculator
without thinking about it, one could, with the automation of the proposed
framework, solve a complex CSE problem by drawing a diagram. Compared to
traditional kriging, the proposed framework can be used to recover unknown
functions with much scarcer data by exploiting interdependencies between
multiple functions and variables. The underlying problem could therefore also
be interpreted as a generalization of that of solving linear systems of
equations to that of approximating unknown variables and functions with noisy,
incomplete, and nonlinear dependencies. Numerous examples illustrate the
flexibility, scope, efficacy, and robustness of the proposed framework and show
how it can be used as a pathway to identifying simple solutions to classical
CSE problems (digital twin modeling, dimension reduction, mode decomposition,
etc.).

European project, is designed to investigate in detail the capability of muon
radiography techniques applied to the imaging of a blast furnace's inner zone.
In particular, the geometry and size of the so called cohesive zone, i.e. the
spatial zone where the slowly downward moving material begins to soften and
melt, that plays an important role in the performance of the blast furnace
itself. Thanks to the high penetration power of the natural cosmic ray muon
radiation, muon transmission radiography represents an appropriate non-invasive
methodology for imaging large high-density structures such as blast furnaces,
whose linear size can be up to a few tens of meters. A state-of-the-art muon
tracking system, whose design profits from the long experience of our
collaboration in this field, is currently under development and will be
installed in 2022 at a blast furnace on the ArcelorMittal site in Bremen
(Germany) for many months. Collected data will be exploited to monitor temporal
variations of the average density distribution inside the furnace. Muon
radiography results will also be compared with measurements obtained through an
enhanced multipoint probe and standard blast furnace models.

fine-grained disagreement between two similar images. Viewpoint change is the
most typical distractor in this task, because it changes the scale and location
of the objects and overwhelms the representation of real change. In this paper,
we propose a Relation-embedded Representation Reconstruction Network (R$^3$Net)
to explicitly distinguish the real change from the large amount of clutter and
irrelevant changes. Specifically, a relation-embedded module is first devised
to explore potential changed objects in the large amount of clutter. Then,
based on the semantic similarities of corresponding locations in the two
images, a representation reconstruction module (RRM) is designed to learn the
reconstruction representation and further model the difference representation.
Besides, we introduce a syntactic skeleton predictor (SSP) to enhance the
semantic interaction between change localization and caption generation.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves the

unifying speech and text pre-training within a single model. We build a single

well understood within the framework of Landau's theory of Fermi liquids. The
low-energy physics of these systems is governed by interacting fermionic
quasiparticles with momenta and energies near a Fermi surface in momentum
space. Nonequilibrium properties are described by a kinetic equation for the
distribution function for quasiparticles proposed by Landau. Quasiparticle
interactions with other quasiparticles, phonons or impurities lead to internal
forces acting on a distribution of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, as well as
collision processes that ultimately limit the transport of mass, heat, charge
and magnetization, as well as limit the coherence times of quasiparticles. For
Fermi liquids that are close to a second order phase transition, e.g. Fermi
liquids that undergo a superfluid transition, \emph{incipient} Cooper pairs -
long-lived fluctuations of the ordered phase - provide a new channel for
scattering quasiparticles, as well as corrections to internal forces acting on
the distribution of nonequilibrium quasiparticles. We develop the theory of
quasiparticle transport for Fermi liquids in the vicinity of a BCS-type
superfluid transition starting from Keldysh's field theory for non-equilibrium,
strongly interacting fermions. The leading corrections to Fermi liquid theory
for non-equilibrium quasiparticle transport near a Cooper instability arise
from the virtual emission and absorption of incipient Cooper pairs. Our theory
is applicable to quasiparticle transport in superconductors, nuclear matter and
the low temperature phases of liquid $^3$He. As an implementation of the theory
we calculate the pairing fluctuation corrections to the attenuation of zero
sound in liquid $^3$He near the superfluid transition and demonstrate
quantitative agreement with experimental results.

saturated vapor pressure is applied to molten indium, such that the selenium
continuously dissolves into the indium solution until the solubility at the
growth temperature is reached; then a slow cooling process results in
crystallization. The selenium dose is matched to its solubility so that indium
selenide compounds can be selectively grown just by controlling the temperature
without the need to consider the chemical ratio in the solution. The pressure
of the vapor is controlled during the whole growth process so that any
deviation from a stoichiometric composition in the crystal can be controlled.

complex, leading to the heterogeneous edges with different semantic
information. In this paper, we focus on exploring the heterogeneous edges for
network representation learning. By considering each relationship as a view
that depicts a specific type of proximity between nodes, we propose a
multi-stage non-negative matrix factorization (MNMF) model, committed to
utilizing abundant information in multiple views to learn robust network
representations. In fact, most existing network embedding methods are closely
related to implicitly factorizing the complex proximity matrix. However, the
approximation error is usually quite large, since a single low-rank matrix is
insufficient to capture the original information. Through a multi-stage matrix
factorization process motivated by gradient boosting, our MNMF model achieves
lower approximation error. Meanwhile, the multi-stage structure of MNMF gives
the feasibility of designing two kinds of non-negative matrix factorization
(NMF) manners to preserve network information better. The united NMF aims to
preserve the consensus information between different views, and the independent
NMF aims to preserve unique information of each view. Concrete experimental
results on realistic datasets indicate that our model outperforms three types
of baselines in practical applications.

regularized policy optimizer, dual variable regularizer, and Nesterov's
accelerated gradient descent dual optimizer, all of which are critical to
achieve a faster convergence. The finite-time error bound of the proposed

subject to nonconcave constraints, the proposed approach is shown to converge
to the global optimum with a complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}(1/\epsilon)$ in

complexity of the existing primal-dual approach by a factor of $\mathcal

lower bound of $\mathcal O(1/\epsilon)$ for convex optimization subject to

agnostic to the RL optimizer used, and thus are more flexible for practical

major hindrance when building realistic models of light dilatons coupled to
matter. We propose a new mechanism for evading such bounds if matter also
couples to a light axion, that exploits nonlinear target-space curvature
interactions to qualitatively change how the fields respond to a gravitating
source. We find that dilaton-matter couplings that would be excluded in the
absence of an axion can become acceptable given an additional small
axion-matter coupling, and this is possible because the axion-dilaton
interactions end up converting the would-be dilaton profile into an axion
profile. The trajectories of matter test bodies are then controlled by the much
weaker axion-matter couplings and can easily be small enough to escape
detection. We call this mechanism Axion Homeopathy because the evasion of the
dilaton-coupling bounds persists for extremely small axion couplings provided
only that they are nonzero. We explore the mechanism using axio-dilaton
equations that are SL(2,R) invariant (as often appear in string
compactifications), since for these the general solutions exterior to a
spherically symmetric source can be found analytically. We use this solution to
compute the relevant PPN parameters, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, and verify that
their difference from unity can be much smaller than would have been true in
the absence of axion-matter couplings and so can therefore evade the

meta-learning algorithm that works well in various computer vision tasks, e.g.,

adapt to a new task in a few steps. However, since the gradient norm of a
classifier (head) is much bigger than those of backbone layers, the model
focuses on learning the decision boundary of the classifier with similar

than those of the other layers. So, the backbone of MAML usually learns
task-generic features, which results in deteriorated adaptation performance in
the inner-loop. To resolve or mitigate this problem, we propose contextual
gradient scaling (CxGrad), which scales gradient norms of the backbone to
facilitate learning task-specific knowledge in the inner-loop. Since the
scaling factors are generated from task-conditioned parameters, gradient norms
of the backbone can be scaled in a task-wise fashion. Experimental results show
that CxGrad effectively encourages the backbone to learn task-specific

simultaneous optimization of extrinsic camera parameters and human meshes from

a novel latent motion prior is proposed to simultaneously optimize extrinsic

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existing semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms typically assume
class-balanced datasets, although the class distributions of many real-world
datasets are imbalanced. In general, classifiers trained on a class-imbalanced
dataset are biased toward the majority classes. This issue becomes more
problematic for SSL algorithms because they utilize the biased prediction of
unlabeled data for training. However, traditional class-imbalanced learning
techniques, which are designed for labeled data, cannot be readily combined
with SSL algorithms. We propose a scalable class-imbalanced SSL algorithm that
can effectively use unlabeled data, while mitigating class imbalance by
introducing an auxiliary balanced classifier (ABC) of a single layer, which is
attached to a representation layer of an existing SSL algorithm. The ABC is
trained with a class-balanced loss of a minibatch, while using high-quality
representations learned from all data points in the minibatch using the
backbone SSL algorithm to avoid overfitting and information loss.Moreover, we
use consistency regularization, a recent SSL technique for utilizing unlabeled
data in a modified way, to train the ABC to be balanced among the classes by
selecting unlabeled data with the same probability for each class. The proposed
algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in various class-imbalanced SSL
experiments using four benchmark datasets.

marketplaces, we study a matching queue. Customers and servers that arrive into
a matching queue depart as soon as they are matched. It is known that a
state-dependent control is needed to ensure the stability of a matching queue.
However, analytically studying the steady-state behaviour of a matching queue,
in general, is challenging. Therefore, inspired by the heavy-traffic regime in
classical queueing theory, we study a matching queue in an asymptotic regime
where the state-dependent control decreases to zero. It turns out that there
are two different ways the control can be sent to zero, and we model these
using two parameters viz., $\epsilon$ is the magnitude scaling parameter that
goes to zero and $\tau$ is the time scaling parameter that goes to infinity.
Intuitively, $\epsilon$ scales the magnitude of the state-dependent control,
and $\tau$ is the threshold after which we modulate the control.
  We show that depending on the relative rates of $\epsilon$ and $\tau$, there
is a phase transition in the limiting regime. We christen the regime when
$\epsilon \tau \to 0$, the time dominates magnitude (TDM) regime, and the
limiting behaviour is a Laplace distribution. The phase transition starts in
the regime when, $\epsilon \tau $ goes to a nonzero constant when the limiting
distribution is a Gibbs distribution, and so we call it the hybrid regime. When
$\epsilon \tau \to \infty$, the limiting distribution converges to a uniform
distribution and we call this the magnitude dominates time (MDT) regime. These
results are established using two related proof techniques. Both the proof
techniques generalizes the characteristic function method. The first one
exploits the underlying structure by engineering complex exponential Lyapunov
functions, and the second is a novel inverse Fourier transform method.

then it tries to optimize the path by considering a possible shorter 3D path.
The point cloud planner is executed at a high frequency to generate the motion

frameworks. We design an experiment with 1865 elbow X-ray images for a

to that in the early Universe due to the Breit-Wigner enhancement, if the DM
particles annihilate through a narrow resonance. Although the $s$-wave
Breit-Wigner enhancement can provide a consistent explanation for both the
observed cosmic-ray (CR) positron excess and the DM thermal relic density, it
is severely constrained by the observations of gamma rays from dwarf spheroidal
satellite galaxies (dSphs) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which
have relatively lower allowed DM annihilation cross section and typical DM
velocities than that in the galactic halo. Furthermore, in the $s$-wave
Breit-Wigner enhancement, the case where the resonance mass is below a
threshold (twice the DM mass) is ruled out due to the monotonically increasing
annihilation cross section with decreasing DM velocity. In this work, we
consider Breit-Wigner enhanced $p$-wave DM annihilation. We explore the
parameter regions which can simultaneously account for the CR positron excess
and DM thermal relic density without violating the constraints from dSphs gamma
rays and CMB. We show that the velocity-dependent cross section in this
scenario can peak around the typical DM velocity in the galactic halo for the
resonance mass both above and below the threshold. Moreover, the highly
suppressed annihilation cross section at extremely low DM velocity can evade
the constraints from dSphs gamma rays and CMB easily, which results in larger
allowed parameter regions than that in the $s$-wave case.

learn better representations and improve accuracy. However, co-occurrence bias
in the training dataset may hamper a DNN model's generalizability to unseen
scenarios in the real world. For example, in COCO, many object categories have
a much higher co-occurrence with men compared to women, which can bias a DNN's
prediction in favor of men. Recent works have focused on task-specific training
strategies to handle bias in such scenarios, but fixing the available data is
often ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel and more generic solution to
address the contextual bias in the datasets by selecting a subset of the
samples, which is fair in terms of the co-occurrence with various classes for a
protected attribute. We introduce a data repair algorithm using the coefficient
of variation, which can curate fair and contextually balanced data for a
protected class(es). This helps in training a fair model irrespective of the
task, architecture or training methodology. Our proposed solution is simple,
effective, and can even be used in an active learning setting where the data
labels are not present or being generated incrementally. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm for the task of object detection and multi-label
image classification across different datasets. Through a series of
experiments, we validate that curating contextually fair data helps make model
predictions fair by balancing the true positive rate for the protected class
across groups without compromising on the model's overall performance.

implicitly account for geometric and photometric variations in facial shape and
appearance, such approaches result in unrealistic completions, especially under
large variations in pose, shape, illumination and mask sizes. To alleviate
these limitations, we introduce 3DFaceFill, an analysis-by-synthesis approach
for face completion that explicitly considers the image formation process. It
comprises three components, (1) an encoder that disentangles the face into its
constituent 3D mesh, 3D pose, illumination and albedo factors, (2) an
autoencoder that inpaints the UV representation of facial albedo, and (3) a
renderer that resynthesizes the completed face. By operating on the UV
representation, 3DFaceFill affords the power of correspondence and allows us to
naturally enforce geometrical priors (e.g. facial symmetry) more effectively.
Quantitatively, 3DFaceFill improves the state-of-the-art by up to 4dB higher
PSNR and 25% better LPIPS for large masks. And, qualitatively, it leads to
demonstrably more photorealistic face completions over a range of masks and

extra privacy threats, compared with traditional authentication mechanisms, as
(a) the IdP could track all RPs which a user is visiting, and (b) collusive RPs
could learn a user's online profile by linking his identities across these RPs.
This paper proposes a privacypreserving SSO system, called UPPRESSO, to protect
a user's login activities against both the curious IdP and collusive RPs. We
analyze the identity dilemma between the security requirements and these
privacy concerns, and convert the SSO privacy problems into an identity
transformation challenge. In each login instance, an ephemeral pseudo-identity
(denoted as PID_RP ) of the RP, is firstly negotiated between the user and the
RP. PID_RP is sent to the IdP and designated in the identity token, so the IdP
is not aware of the visited RP. Meanwhile, PID_RP is used by the IdP to
transform the permanent user identity ID_U into an ephemeral user
pseudo-identity (denoted as PID_U ) in the identity token. On receiving the
identity token, the RP transforms PID_U into a permanent account (denoted as
Acct) of the user, by an ephemeral trapdoor in the negotiation. Given a user,
the account at each RP is unique and different from ID_U, so collusive RPs
cannot link his identities across these RPs. We build the UPPRESSO prototype on
top of MITREid Connect, an open-source implementation of OIDC. The extensive
evaluation shows that UPPRESSO fulfills the requirements of both security and
privacy and introduces reasonable overheads.

decoding should be performed with some future information input (i.e., with

be able to achieve high recognition accuracy while keeping the latency low.

healthinformation such as cardio output and blood supplies to vital organs. The

linearly proportional to the blood speed and independent of the tube diameter.

the diffused light equation inthe regime where the convective flow is the
dominating factor for decorrelation. As a result, wehave demonstrated a

Recently, it has been found that with the FoV and eye movement data collected

works investigate the privacy protection for eye movement, but never address
how to protect the privacy in terms of FoV and how the privacy protection
affects the QoE. In this paper, we strive to characterize and satisfy the FoV
privacy requirement. We consider ""trading resources for privacy"". We first add
camouflaged tile requests around the real FoV and define spatial degree of
privacy (SDoP) as a normalized number of camouflaged tile requests. By
consuming more resources to ensure SDoP, the real FoVs can be hidden. Then, we
proceed to analyze the impacts of SDoP on the QoE by jointly optimizing the
durations for prediction, computing, and transmission that maximizes the QoE
given arbitrary predictor, configured resources, and SDoP. We find that a
larger SDoP requires more resources but degrades the performance of tile
prediction. Simulation with state-of-the-art predictors on a real dataset
verifies the analysis and shows that a user requiring a larger SDoP can be
served with better QoE.

levels of magnification bias ranging from s = 0 to s = 1.2, where s is the
logarithmic slope of the cumulative magnitude number counts, in three redshift
intervals within 1 < z < 1.95. We studied the two-point correlation function
multipole moments in the different cases in the same way as would be applied to
real data, and investigated how well the growth rate of structure parameter
could be recovered. In the analysis, we used an hybrid model that combines
non-linear redshift-space distortions and linear curved-sky lensing
magnification. We find that the growth rate is underestimated when
magnification bias is not accounted for in the modelling. This bias becomes
non-negligible for z > 1.3 and can reach 10% at z = 1.8, depending on the
properties of the target sample. In our data, adding the lensing linear
correction allowed us to recover an unbiased estimate of the growth rate in
most cases when the correction was small, even when the fiducial cosmology was
different from that of the data. For larger corrections (high redshifts, low
bias, and high s value), we find that the weak-lensing limit has to be treated
with caution as it may no longer be a good approximation . Our results also
show the importance of knowing s in advance instead of letting this parameter
free with flat priors because in this case, the error bars increase
significantly.

serious computational challenges which limit their scalability and practical
usefulness in applied settings. Here, we propose a novel, deep generative
modelling approach to tackle this challenge, termed PriorVAE: for a particular

subsequent fitting of a variational autoencoder (VAE). Given a trained VAE, the
resultant decoder allows spatial inference to become incredibly efficient due
to the low dimensional, independently distributed latent Gaussian space
representation of the VAE. Once trained, inference using the VAE decoder
replaces the GP within a Bayesian sampling framework. This approach provides
tractable and easy-to-implement means of approximately encoding spatial priors
and facilitates efficient statistical inference. We demonstrate the utility of
our VAE two stage approach on Bayesian, small-area estimation tasks.

history of our Solar System (SS). In particular, the isotopic fraction of
nitrogen (14N/15N) is lower in comets and other pristine SS bodies with respect
to the value measured for the protosolar nebula, suggesting a local chemical
enrichment of 15N during the SS formation. Therefore, interferometric studies
of nitrogen fractionation in SS precursors are imperative for us to obtain
clues about our astrochemical origins. In this work, we investigated the
variation of the 14N/15N ratio in one of the closest analogues of the
environment in which the SS was born: the protocluster OMC-2 FIR4. We present
the first comparison at high angular resolution between HCN and N2H+ using
interferometric data. We analysed observations of the HCN isotopologues H13CN
and HC15N in the OMC-2 FIR4 protocluster, specifically the transitions H13CN
(1-0) and HC15N (1-0), from NOEMA within the context of the IRAM Seeds Of Life
In Space Large Program. We combined our results with analysis of archival data
obtained with ALMA of N2H+ and its 15N isotopologues. Our results show a small
regional variation in the ratio for HCN from ~250 to 500. The ratios in the
central regions of FIR4, where the candidate protostars are located, are
largely consistent (~300). They also show little variation from the part of the
protocluster known to harbour a high cosmic-ray ionisation rate, to the portion
with lower rate. We also found a small variation in the ratio of N2H+ across
different regions from ~200 to ~400. These results suggest that local changes
in the physical parameters occurring on small linear scales probed by our
observations do not seem to affect the 14N/15N ratio in either HCN or N2H+ and
hence that this is independent of the molecule used. Moreover, the high level
of irradiation due to cosmic rays does not affect the N-fractionation either.

of accuracy, coverage and speed. To close the gap, we here extend the framework
of sequence-to-sequence models for constituent parsing, not only by providing a
more powerful neural architecture for improving their performance, but also by
enlarging their coverage to handle the most complex syntactic phenomena:
discontinuous structures. To that end, we design several novel linearizations
that can fully produce discontinuities and, for the first time, we test a
sequence-to-sequence model on the main discontinuous benchmarks, obtaining
competitive results on par with task-specific discontinuous constituent parsers

great interest in wireless sensor networks. However, the shadow fading term
caused by obstacles cannot be separated from the received signal, which leads
to severe error in location estimate. In this paper, we approximate the
log-normal sum distribution through Fenton-Wilkinson method to formulate a
non-convex maximum likelihood (ML) estimator with unknown shadow fading factor.
In order to overcome the difficulty in solving the non-convex problem, we
propose a novel algorithm to estimate the locations of sources. Specifically,
the region is divided into $N$ grids firstly, and the multi-source localization
is converted into a sparse recovery problem so that we can obtain the sparse
solution. Then we utilize the K-means clustering method to obtain the rough
locations of the off-grid sources as the initial feasible point of the ML
estimator. Finally, an iterative refinement of the estimated locations is
proposed by dynamic updating of the localization dictionary. The proposed
algorithm can efficiently approach a superior local optimal solution of the ML
estimator. It is shown from the simulation results that the proposed method has
a promising localization performance and improves the robustness for
multi-source localization in unknown shadow fading environments. Moreover, the
proposed method provides a better computational complexity from $O(K^3N^3)$ to
$O(N^3)$.

forced the public health authorities and pharmaceutical companies to develop
anti-COVID-19 vaccines in record time. Currently, almost 80% of the population
are vaccinated with the required number of doses in Spain. Thus, in this paper,
COVID-19 incidence and lethality rates are analyzed through a segmented
spatio-temporal regression model that allows studying if there is an
association between a certain vaccination level and a change (in mean) in
either the incidence or the lethality rates. Spatial dependency is included by
considering the Besag-York-Molli\'e model, whereas natural cubic splines are
used for capturing the temporal structure of the data. Lagged effects between
the exposure and the outcome are also taken into account. The results suggest
that COVID-19 vaccination has not allowed yet (as of September 2021) to observe
a consistent reduction in incidence levels at a regional scale in Spain. In
contrast, the lethality rates have displayed a declining tendency which has
associated with vaccination levels above 50%.

of SN 2018hfm reaches a peak with value of -18.69+/-0.64 mag, followed by a
fast decline(4.42+/-0.13 mag (100d)-1). After about 50 days, it is found to
experience a large flux drop (~3.0 mag in V), and then enters into an unusually
faint tail, which indicates a relatively small amount of 56Ni synthesized
during the explosion. From the bolometric light curve, SN 2018hfm is estimated
to have low ejecta mass (~1.3M) and low explosion energy(~10 50 erg) compared
with typical SNe II. The photospheric spectra of SN 2018hfm are similar to
those of other SNe II, with P Cygni profiles of the Balmer series and metal
lines, while at late phases the spectra are characterised by box-like profiles
of HU emission, suggesting significant interaction between the SN ejecta and
circumstellar matter. These box-like emission features are found to show
increasing asymmetry with time, with the red-side component becoming gradually
weaker, indicating that dust is continuously formed in the ejecta. Based on the

of superconductivity it has been expected to be close to a ferromagnetic
instability showing many similarities to the U-based ferromagnetic
superconductors, URhGe and UCoGe. The competition between different types of
magnetic interactions and the duality between the local and itinerant character

key parameters in the rich phase diagrams discovered recently under extreme

macroscopic and microscopic experiments at low temperature to clarify the
normal phase properties at ambient pressure. Special attention will be given to
the occurrence of a metamagnetic transition at Hm = 35 T for a magnetic field
applied along the hard magnetic axis b. Adding external pressure leads to
strong changes in the magnetic and electronic properties with a direct feedback
on superconductivity. Attention will be given on the possible evolution of the
Fermi surface as a function of magnetic field and pressure. Superconductivity
in UTe2 is extremely rich exhibiting various unconventional behaviors which
will be highlighted. It shows an exceptionally huge superconducting upper
critical field with a re-entrant behavior under magnetic field and the
occurrence of multiple superconducting phases in the temperature field,

by their high degeneracy, a small perturbation introduced in the system is able
to push the ground state in the direction of an ordered phase of interest.
Hence the flat band engineering in real materials attracts huge attention.
However, manufacturing a flat band represents a difficult task because its
appearance in a real system is connected to rigid mathematical conditions
relating a part of Hamiltonian parameters. Consequently, whenever a flat band
is desired to be manufactured, these Hamiltonian parameters must be tuned
exactly to the values fixed by these rigid mathematical conditions. Here we
demonstrate that taking the many-body spin-orbit interaction (SOI) into account
-- which can be continuously tuned e.g. by external electric fields --, these
rigid mathematical conditions can be substantially relaxed. On this line we
show that a $\sim 20-30 \%$ variation in the Hamiltonian parameters rigidly
fixed by the flat band conditions can also lead to flat bands in the same or in
a bit displaced position on the energy axis. This percentage can even increase
to $\sim 80 \%$ in the presence of an external magnetic field. The study is
made in the case of conducting polymers. These systems are relevant not only
because they have broad application possibilities, but also because they can be
used to present the mathematical background of the flat band conditions in full

changes with the external magnetic field, reflecting various physical origins
and microstructures of the substance. A large MR, namely a huge response to a
low external field, has always been a useful functional feature in industrial
technology and a core goal pursued by physicists and materials scientists.
Conventional large MR materials are mainly manganites, whose colossal MR (CMR)
can be as high as -90%. The dominant mechanism is attributed to spin
configuration aligned by the external field, which reduces magnetic scattering
and thus resistance. In recent years, some new systems have shown an extremely
large unsaturated MR (XMR). Unlike ordinary metals, the positive MR of these
systems can reach 103-108% and is persistent under super high magnetic fields.
The XMR materials are mainly metals or semimetals, distributed in high-mobility
topological or non-topological systems, and some are magnetic, which suggests a
wide range of application scenarios. Various mechanisms have been proposed for
the potential physical origin of XMR, including electron-hole compensation,
steep band, ultrahigh mobility, high residual resistance ratio, topological
fermions, etc. It turns out that some mechanisms play a leading role in certain
systems, while more are far from clearly defined. In addition, the researches
on XMR are largely overlapped or closely correlated with other recently rising
physics and materials researches, such as topological matters and
two-dimensional (2D) materials, which makes elucidating the mechanism of XMR
even more important. Moreover, the disclosed novel properties will lay a broad

demonstrate that knowledge graph-based representations already achieve

Furthermore, when combined with existing, contextual representations, knowledge
graph-based document representations can achieve state-of-the-art performance.
To our knowledge this is the first larger-scale evaluation of how knowledge
graph-based representations can be systematically incorporated into the process

architecture, POSEIDON consists of two major elements: a spacecraft with a
large set of instruments that would orbit Titan, preferably in a
low-eccentricity polar orbit, and a suite of in situ investigation components,
i.e. a lake lander, a ""heavy"" drone (possibly amphibious) and/or a fleet of
mini-drones, dedicated to the exploration of the polar regions. The ideal
arrival time at Titan would be slightly before the next northern Spring equinox
(2039), as equinoxes are the most active periods to monitor still largely
unknown atmospheric and surface seasonal changes. The exploration of Titan
northern latitudes with an orbiter and in situ element(s) would be highly
complementary with the upcoming NASA New Frontiers Dragonfly mission that will
provide in situ exploration of Titan equatorial regions in the mid-2030s.

nearly-on-axis. These kilonovae would be significantly polluted by the
associated afterglow emission. Only at large viewing angles with
$\sin\theta_{\rm v}\gtrsim 0.20$, the EM signals of most BNS mergers would be
kilonova-dominated and some off-axis afterglows may emerge at $\sim5-10$\,day
after the mergers.} At brightness dimmer than $\sim23-24$\,mag, according to
their luminosity functions, the number of afterglows is much larger than that
of kilonovae. Since the search depth of the present survey projects is
$<22$\,mag, the number of afterglow events detected via serendipitous
observations would be much higher than that of kilonova events, consistent with
the current observations. {For the foreseeable survey projects (e.g., Mephisto,
WFST, LSST) whose search depths can reach $\gtrsim23-24$\,mag, the detection
rate of kilonovae could have the same order of magnitude as that of
afterglows.} We also find that it may be difficult to use the fading rate in a
single band to directly identify kilonovae and afterglows among various
fast-evolving transients by serendipitous surveys. However, the color evolution
between optical and infrared bands can identify them, since their color
evolution patterns are unique compared with those of other fast-evolving

challenges for route recommendation are route representation and user
representation. Different from items that can be identified by unique IDs in
traditional recommendation, routes are combinations of links (i.e., a road
segment and its following action like turning left) and the number of
combinations could be close to infinite. Besides, the representation of a route
changes under different scenarios. These facts result in severe sparsity of
routes, which increases the difficulty of route representation. Moreover, link
attribute deficiencies and errors affect preciseness of route representation.
Because of the sparsity of routes, the interaction data between users and
routes are also sparse. This makes it not easy to acquire user representation
from historical user-item interactions as traditional recommendations do. To
address these issues, we propose a novel learning framework R4. In R4, we
design a sparse & dense network to obtain representations of routes. The sparse
unit learns link ID embeddings and aggregates them to represent a route, which
captures implicit route characteristics and subsequently alleviates problems
caused by link attribute deficiencies and errors. The dense unit extracts
implicit local features of routes from link attributes. For user
representation, we utilize a series of historical navigation to extract user
preference. R4 achieves remarkable performance in both offline and online
experiments.

  Methods: Electromagnetic and thermal simulations were performed to determine
the worst-case RF heating of 10 patient-derived FRL models during MRI at 1.5 T
and 3 T and at imaging landmarks corresponding to head, chest and abdomen. RF
heating measurements were performed in phantoms implanted with reconstructed
FRL models that produced highest heating in numerical simulations. The
potential for unintended tissue stimulation was assessed through a conservative
estimation of the electric field induced in the tissue due to gradient-induced
voltages developed along the length of FRLs.
  Results: In simulations under conservative approach, RF exposure at B1+<2 uT
generated CEM43<40 at all imaging landmarks at both 1.5 T and 3 T indicating no
thermal damage for acquisition times (TA) <10 minutes. In experiments, the
maximum temperature rise when FRLs were positioned at the location of maximum
electric field exposure was measured to be 2.4 degrees Celsius at 3 T and 2.1
degrees Celsius at 1.5 T. Electric fields induced in the tissue due to
gradient-induced voltages remained below the threshold for cardiac tissue
stimulation in all cases.
  Conclusions: Simulation and experimental results indicate that patients with
FRLs can be scanned safely at both 1.5 T and 3 T with majority of clinical
pulse sequences.

individual heterogeneous effects with cohort formation for their
time-variations, which allows common coefficients between nonadjacent time

Consistency and asymptotic normality for the proposed estimators are developed.
We show that the resulting estimators exhibit oracle properties, i.e., the

obtained using the known group and cohort structures. Furthermore, the
simulation studies provide supportive evidence that the proposed method has
good finite sample performance. A real data empirical application has been

Latent Replay-based Continual Learning (CL) techniques[1] enable online,
serverless adaptation in principle, but so farthey have still been too
computation and memory-hungry for ultra-low-power TinyML devices, which are
typically based on microcontrollers. In this work, we introduce a HW/SW

ultra-low-power (PULP) processor. We rethink the baseline Latent Replay CL
algorithm, leveraging quantization of the frozen stage of the model and Latent
Replays (LRs) to reduce their memory cost with minimal impact on accuracy. In
particular, 8-bit compression of the LR memory proves to be almost lossless
(-0.26% with 3000LR) compared to the full-precision baseline implementation,
but requires 4x less memory, while 7-bit can also be used with an additional
minimal accuracy degradation (up to 5%). We also introduce optimized primitives
for forward and backward propagation on the PULP processor. Our results show
that by combining these techniques, continual learning can be achieved in
practice using less than 64MB of memory an amount compatible with embedding in
TinyML devices. On an advanced 22nm prototype of our platform, called VEGA, the
proposed solution performs onaverage 65x faster than a low-power STM32 L4

and graphics. Current methods often show limited accuracy in predicting normals
at sharp features (e.g., edges and corners) and less robustness to noise. In
this paper, we propose a novel normal estimation method for point clouds. It
consists of two phases: (a) feature encoding which learns representations of
local patches, and (b) normal estimation that takes the learned representation
as input and regresses the normal vector. We are motivated that local patches
on isotropic and anisotropic surfaces have similar or distinct normals, and
that separable features or representations can be learned to facilitate normal
estimation. To realise this, we first construct triplets of local patches on 3D
point cloud data, and design a triplet network with a triplet loss for feature
encoding. We then design a simple network with several MLPs and a loss function
to regress the normal vector. Despite having a smaller network size compared to
most other methods, experimental results show that our method preserves sharp
features and achieves better normal estimation results on CAD-like shapes.

where an even-order nonlinear electrical conductivity can be nonzero, resulting
in nonreciprocity. Second-order nonlinear conductivities attract much attention
because of their sensitivity to detect inversion-symmetry breaking in materials
and their functionalities. However, while the nonlinear response has been
actively studied in noninteracting systems for a long time, the nonlinear
response in strongly correlated materials is still poorly understood. This
paper analyzes the nonlinear conductivity in a correlated noncentrosymmetric
system, namely a Kondo lattice system with Rashba type spin-orbit coupling. We
mainly focus on the ferromagnetic phase, in which the second-order nonlinear
conductivity becomes finite. Remarkably, we find that the second-order
conductivity becomes only finite perpendicular to the ferromagnetic
magnetization and has a strong spin dependence; due to a gap at the Fermi
energy for one spin direction, the linear and nonlinear conductivity is only
finite for the ungapped spin direction. Finally, we analyze sign changes in the
nonlinear conductivity, which can be explained by a combination of correlation
effects and the energetic shift due to the occurring ferromagnetism.

whole problem as a mathematical program, where all parties are required to
exchange information to obtain the optimal objective function value. This
information bears private data from each party in terms of coefficients used in
the mathematical program. Moreover, the parties also consider the individual
optimal solutions as private. In this setting, the concern for the parties is
the privacy of their data and their optimal allocations. We propose a two-step
approach to meet the privacy requirements of the parties. In the first step, we
obtain a reformulated model that is amenable to a decomposition scheme.
Although this scheme eliminates almost all data exchange, it does not provide a
formal privacy guarantee. In the second step, we provide this guarantee with a
differentially private algorithm at the expense of deviating slightly from the
optimality. We provide bounds on this deviation and discuss the consequences of
these theoretical results. We also propose a novel modification to increase the
efficiency of the algorithm in terms of reducing the theoretical optimality
gap. The study ends with a numerical experiment on a planning problem that
demonstrates an application of the proposed approach. As we work with a general

sample the depth of the entire scene uniformly at a fixed scan rate. This leads
to limited spatio-temporal resolution where redundant static information is
over-sampled and precious motion information might be under-sampled. In this
paper, we present an efficient bio-inspired event-camera-driven depth
estimation algorithm. In our approach, we dynamically illuminate areas of
interest densely, depending on the scene activity detected by the event camera,
and sparsely illuminate areas in the field of view with no motion. The depth
estimation is achieved by an event-based structured light system consisting of
a laser point projector coupled with a second event-based sensor tuned to
detect the reflection of the laser from the scene. We show the feasibility of
our approach in a simulated autonomous driving scenario and real indoor
sequences using our prototype. We show that, in natural scenes like autonomous
driving and indoor environments, moving edges correspond to less than 10% of
the scene on average. Thus our setup requires the sensor to scan only 10% of
the scene, which could lead to almost 90% less power consumption by the

such a constraint, we present in this paper a nonlinear up-conversion

into the visible SF wave. Based on a Stokes-Mueller formalism developed here,
the IR polarization is successfully retrieved from SF light with high

periodic ones are missing a formulation to learn the orientation. To address
this gap, we propose a novel DMP formulation that enables encoding of periodic

Riemannian metric-based projection approach and unit quaternion based periodic
DMP. Both formulations exploit unit quaternions to represent the orientation.
However, the first exploits the properties of Riemannian manifolds to work in
the tangent space of the unit sphere. The second encodes directly the unit
quaternion trajectory while guaranteeing the unitary norm of the generated

of instabilities. Important among them is the kink instability which plays a
central part in the nanoflare theory of coronal heating, and for this reason in
numerical simulations it is usually induced by tightly-controlled perturbations
and studied in isolation. In contrast, we find that when disturbances are
introduced in our magnetohydrodynamic flux tube simulations by dynamic twisting
of the flow at the boundaries fluting modes of instability are readily excited.
We also find that the flute instability, which has been theorised but rarely
observed in the coronal context, is strongly enhanced when plasma viscosity is
assumed anisotropic. We proceed to investigate the co-existence and competition
between flute and kink instabilities for a range of values of the resistivity
and of the parameters of the anisotropic and isotropic models of viscosity. We
conclude that while the flute instability cannot prevent the kink from
ultimately dominating, it can significantly delay its development especially at
strong viscous anisotropy induced by intense magnetic fields.

sliced divergences. We show that smoothing and slicing preserve the metric
property and the weak topology. We also provide results on the sample
complexity of such divergences. Since, the privacy level depends on the amount

divergence. We support our theoretical findings with empirical studies of
Gaussian smoothed and sliced version of Wassertein distance, Sinkhorn
divergence and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). In the context of
privacy-preserving domain adaptation, we confirm that those Gaussian smoothed
sliced Wasserstein and MMD divergences perform very well while ensuring data

Multiple mechanisms are known to give rise to turbulence in
protoplanetary disks, which facilitates the accretion onto the central star.
Small dust particles that are well coupled to the gas undergo diffusion due to
this turbulent motion. Aims. This paper investigates the influence of
turbulence induced dust diffusion on the equilibrium of protoplanetary disks.
Methods. The model accounts for dust sublimation, radiative transfer with the
flux-limited diffusion approximation and dust diffusion. It predicts the
density and temperature profiles as well as the dust-to-gas ratio of the disk.
Results. It is shown that dust diffusion can have a large impact: assuming the
dust survives for 104 seconds or longer before it can be evaporated, leads the
dust diffusion to widen the inner disk considerably. The latter effect is
generated through a feedback mechanism as the diffusion length is much smaller
than the disk width. With increasing dust diffusion, the inclination of the
inner rim towards the stellar radiation becomes steeper until it is almost
vertical. The temperature range of evaporation and condensation, which is
linked to the dust composition, has no influence on this effect. Conclusions.
For realistic parameters dust diffusion can not be neglected when determining
the equilibrium of the disk. Stronger turbulence inside the disk induces more
dust diffusion. Therefore, the dust density grows more gradually over a greater
distance and less radiation reaches the disk surface. The new equilibrium shape
of the disk is more inclined towards the star. This effect is universal and
independent of the specific dust composition.

the so-called qubit allocation, which is the step in a cloud service to relate
physical qubits in hardware to a circuit proposed by a user. Consequently, the
certification is valid no matter how unsuccessful qubit allocations may be in
cloud computing or how untrustful the service may be in qubit allocations. We
then demonstrate the certification of entanglement generation on two and three

successfully certified in the IonQ service that does not provide a command of
qubit allocations. The capabilities of entanglement generation in the circuits

incremental propensity score interventions is to estimate the effect of

from the average treatment effect, where the aim is to estimate the effect of
everyone deterministically receiving versus not receiving treatment. We first
present incremental causal effects for the case when there is a single binary
treatment, such that it can be compared to average treatment effects and thus
shed light on key concepts. In particular, a benefit of incremental effects is
that positivity - a common assumption in causal inference - is not needed to
identify causal effects. Then we discuss the more general case where treatment
is measured at multiple time points, where positivity is more likely to be
violated and thus incremental effects can be especially useful. Throughout, we
motivate incremental effects with real-world applications, present
nonparametric estimators for these effects, and discuss their efficiency
properties, while also briefly reviewing the role of influence functions in
functional estimation. Finally, we show how to interpret and analyze results
using these estimators in practice, and discuss extensions and future

on the Internet. Any deliberate discrimination of traffic of one application
while favoring others violates the principle of neutrality. Many countries have
enforced laws against such discrimination. To enforce such laws, one requires
tools to detect any net neutrality violations. However, detecting such
violations is challenging as it is hard to separate any degradation in quality
due to natural network effects and selective degradation. Also, legitimate
traffic management and deliberate discrimination methods can be technically the
same, making it further challenging to distinguish them.
  We developed an end-to-end measurement framework named FairNet to detect
discrimination of traffic. It compares the performance of similar services. Our
focus is on HTTPS streaming services which constitute a predominant portion of
the Internet traffic. The effect of confounding factors (congestion, traffic
management policy, dynamic rate adaptation) is made `similar' on the test
services to ensure a fair comparison. FairNet framework uses a ``replay
server'' and user-client that exchanges correctly identifiable traffic streams
over the Internet. The Server Name Indication (SNI) field in the TLS handshake,
which goes in plaintext, ensures that the traffic from the replay server
appears to network middle-boxes as that coming from its actual server. We
validated that appropriate SNIs results in the correct classification of
services using a commercial traffic shaper. FairNet uses two novel algorithms
based on application-level throughput and connection status to detect traffic
discrimination. We also validated the methodology's effectiveness by collecting
network logs through mobile apps over the live Internet and analyzing them.

reconnection of the vertical umbral field with the more horizontal field above
the light bridges. Because these jets are not fully opaque in chromospheric
lines, one cannot study their spectra without the highly complex considerations
of radiative transfer in spectral lines from the atmosphere behind the fan. We
get around this by taking advantage of a unique set of observations of the
H$\alpha$ line along with the Ca II 8542 and Ca II K lines obtained with the
Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope where a fan-shaped jet was backlit by an X9.3
flare. The H$\alpha$ flare ribbon emission profiles from behind the fan are
highly broadened and flattened, allowing us to investigate the fan as if it
were backlit by continuous emission. Using this model we derived the opacity
and velocity of the material in the jet and what we believe to be the first
observationally derived estimate of the mass and density of material in a
fan-shaped jet. Using inversions of Ca II 8542 emission via STiC, we were also
able to estimate the temperature in the jet. Finally, we use the masses and POS
and LOS velocities as functions of time to investigate the downward supply of
energy and momentum to the photosphere in the collapse of this jet, and
evaluate it as a potential driver for a sunquake beneath. We found that the
physical properties of the fan material are reasonably chromospheric in nature,

delivered to the base of the fan in its collapse was nearly two orders of

the sunquake driver, but cannot completely rule out larger fan jets as
potential drivers.

closely mimic a Kerr black hole, but have a quadrupole moment that differs from
Kerr. Recently, arXiv:2109.09814 studied the dynamical stability of the
stationary black shells against radial perturbations and accretion of matter,
and examined a two parameter family of fluxes required for stability. In this
paper, we re-examine the rotating black shells with particular attention to the
constraints imposed by this dynamical analysis for non-rotating shells.
Extrapolating these results to rotating shells, we find that they can indeed
support themselves at a critical point in the gravitational potential.
Additionally, requiring that they settle back to their new Buchdahl radius
after accreting matter, uniquely fixes the fluxes required for dynamical
stability. The flux parameters turn out to have an extremely simple form, and
fulfil one of the constraints for perturbative radial stability while exactly
saturating the other. The preferred quadrupole moment that we find, given some
physical assumptions, is 7% less than Kerr.

  Model Hubs","47 pages, camera-ready version for JMLR 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Model hubs with many pre-trained models (PTMs) have become a cornerstone of
deep learning. Although built at a high cost, they remain
\emph{under-exploited} -- practitioners usually pick one PTM from the provided
model hub by popularity and then fine-tune the PTM to solve the target task.
This na\""ive but common practice poses two obstacles to full exploitation of
pre-trained model hubs: first, the PTM selection by popularity has no
optimality guarantee, and second, only one PTM is used while the remaining PTMs
are ignored. An alternative might be to consider all possible combinations of
PTMs and extensively fine-tune each combination, but this would not only be
prohibitive computationally but may also lead to statistical over-fitting. In
this paper, we propose a new paradigm for exploiting model hubs that is
intermediate between these extremes. The paradigm is characterized by two
aspects: (1) We use an evidence maximization procedure to estimate the maximum
value of label evidence given features extracted by pre-trained models. This
procedure can rank all the PTMs in a model hub for various types of PTMs and
tasks \emph{before fine-tuning}. (2) The best ranked PTM can either be
fine-tuned and deployed if we have no preference for the model's architecture
or the target PTM can be tuned by the top $K$ ranked PTMs via a Bayesian
procedure that we propose. This procedure, which we refer to as
\emph{B-Tuning}, not only improves upon specialized methods designed for tuning
homogeneous PTMs, but also applies to the challenging problem of tuning
heterogeneous PTMs where it yields a new level of benchmark performance.

separation task, aims to recover two layers, $\textit{i.e.}$, transmission and
reflection, from one mixed observation, which is challenging due to the highly
ill-posed nature. Existing deep learning based solutions typically restore the
target layers individually, or with some concerns at the end of the output,
barely taking into account the interaction across the two streams/branches. In
order to utilize information more efficiently, this work presents a general yet
simple interactive strategy, namely $\textit{your trash is my treasure}$
(YTMT), for constructing dual-stream decomposition networks. To be specific, we
explicitly enforce the two streams to communicate with each other block-wisely.
Inspired by the additive property between the two components, the interactive
path can be easily built via transferring, instead of discarding, deactivated
information by the ReLU rectifier from one stream to the other. Both ablation
studies and experimental results on widely-used SIRS datasets are conducted to
demonstrate the efficacy of YTMT, and reveal its superiority over other

study accretion, as their relatively quick evolution allows us to monitor large
changes in the in-flowing and/or out-flowing material over human timescales.
However, the details of how the inflow-outflow coupling evolves during a BHXB
outburst remain an area of active debate. In this work we attempt to probe the
physical changes underlying the system evolution, by performing a systematic
analysis of the multi-wavelength data of three BHXB sources: XTE J1752-223,
MAXI J1659-152, and XTE J1650-500, during hard and hard-intermediate states.
Using the power spectral hue which characterises the X-ray variability
properties, we identify several clusters of BHXB epochs and perform the joint
multi-wavelength spectral modelling to test their commonality with a physical
jet model. Under the assumption that the corona is related to the base of the
jet, we find that the power spectral hue traces the variation of the coronal
radius(from ~10Rg - ~40Rg) in multiple BHXBs at hard and hard-intermediate
states, and that the data are consistent with moderately truncated accretion
discs (<25Rg) during hard-intermediate states. We also find that all epochs of
low disc reflection have high hue located near the hard-intermediate to
soft-intermediate state transition, indicating that in these states the
vertical extent of the corona and/or its bulk speed are increasing. Our results
link the geometrical similarity in the corona among multiple BHXB sources to
their timing characteristics, and probe the corona responding to the disc-jet
interactions at hard and intermediate states during outbursts.

to account for grid operational flexibility--the ability to reconfigure the
system safely. In essence, the generation hosting capacity is determined
against the set of limiting factors--voltage, thermal (conductor loading),
reverse flow (at the feeder head, station transformer, or substation), and
change in the voltage (due to sudden change in generation output)). Not that
long ago, California Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs) added a new criterion that
does not allow reverse flow at the supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) points that can change the system configuration, aiming to prevent the
potential transfer of reverse flow to an adjacent feeder. This new criterion
intended to capture operational constraints as part of hosting capacity-known
as hosting capacity with operational flexibility (OpFlex). This paper explores
the shortfalls of such an approach and proposes performing actual transfer
analysis when determining hosting capacity rather than implementing the OpFlex
approach. Furthermore, we discuss the need for transition to determining
hosting capacity profile (all intervals) rather than a flat line (one, worst
performing interval) hosting capacity. A hosting capacity profile would inform
the developers of interval-by-interval limits and opportunities, creating new
opportunities to reach higher penetration of DERs at a lower cost. With
technological and computational advancements, such an approach is neither out
of implementation reach nor that computationally expensive. In return, far more
DER can be interconnected once programmed not to violate certain generation
profiles as part of the interconnection requirement, and utilities would be
better informed of their actual operational flexibility, benefiting society
overall.

that they are tractable with respect to the number of decision-makers and can
be implemented in a distributed manner. In addition, the main results are

our universe. Given a power spectrum, the ensuing cosmic microwave background
is calculated and compared to the observed one. Thus, one focus of modern
cosmology is building well-motivated inflationary models that predict the
primordial power spectrum observables. The common practice uses analytic terms
for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the index running $\alpha$, forgoing
the effort required to evaluate the model numerically. However, the validity of
these terms has never been rigorously probed and relies on perturbative
methods, which may lose their efficacy for large perturbations. The requirement
for more accurate theoretical predictions becomes crucial with the advent of
highly sensitive measuring instruments. This paper probes the limits of the
perturbative treatment that connects inflationary potential parameters to
primordial power spectrum observables. We show that the validity of analytic
approximations of the scalar index roughly respects the large-field/small-field
dichotomy. We supply an easily calculated measure for relative perturbation
amplitude and show that, for large field models, the validity of analytical
terms extends to $\sim 3\%$ perturbation relative to a power-law inflation
model. Conversely, the analytical treatment loses its validity for small-field
models with as little as $0.1\%$ perturbation relative to the small-field
test-case. By employing the most general artificial neural networks and
multinomial functions up to the twentieth degree and demonstrating their
shortcomings, we show that no reasonable analytic expressions correlating small
field models to the observables the yield exists. Finally, we discuss the
possible implications of this work and supply the validity heuristic for large

characterise collision invariants only in the case of the so-called canonical

problems is of great practical relevance in many scientific disciplines and
applications, such as artificial intelligence and operations research. One of
the main open problems is the lack of ergodicity, or mode collapse, for typical
stochastic solvers based on Monte Carlo techniques leading to poor
generalization or lack of robustness to uncertainties. Currently, there is no
universal metric to quantify such performance deficiencies across various
solvers. Here, we introduce a new diversity measure for quantifying the number
of independent approximate solutions for NP-hard optimization problems. To test
this metric, we compare the sampling power of various quantum annealing
strategies. We show that the inhomogeneous quantum annealing schedules can
redistribute and suppress the emergence of topological defects by controlling
space-time separated critical fronts, leading to an advantage over standard
quantum annealing schedules with respect to both Time-To-Solution (TTS) and
Time-To-Diversity (TTD) for finding rare solutions. Using Path-Integral Monte
Carlo simulations for up to 1600 qubits, we demonstrate that non-equilibrium
driving of quantum fluctuations, guided by efficient approximate tensor network
contractions, can significantly reduce the fraction of hard instances for
random frustrated 2D spin-glasses with local fields. Specifically, we observe
that by creating a class of algorithmic quantum phase transitions the diversity
of solutions can be enhanced by up to 40% with the fraction of hard-to-sample
instances reducing by more than 25%.

observe today have reached their current mass via mergers with smaller galaxy
satellites (Moore et al.1999). This hierarchical process is expected to take
place on smaller scales for the satellites themselves, that should build-up
from the accretion of smaller building blocks (D'Onghia & Lake 2008). The best
chance we have to test this prediction is by looking at the most massive
satellite of the Milky Way (MW): the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Smaller
galaxies have been revealed to orbit around the LMC (Erkal & Belokurov 2020,
Patel et al. 2020), but so far the only evidence for mutual interactions is
related to the orbital interplay with the nearby Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC),
which is the most massive LMC satellite. In this work, we report the likely
discovery of a past merger event that the LMC experienced with a galaxy with a
low star formation efficiency and likely having a stellar mass similar to those
of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This former LMC satellite has now completely
dissolved, depositing the old globular cluster (GC) NGC 2005 as part of its
debris. This GC is the only surviving witness of this ancient merger event,
recognizable through its peculiar chemical composition. This discovery is the
observational evidence that the process of hierarchical assembly has worked
also in shaping our closest satellites.

perspective of sigma-max inference (probability-possibility inference), with a
focus on discovering whether some of the unknown quantities involved could be
more faithfully modeled as fuzzy uncertainty. Two related key issues are
addressed: 1) the random-fuzzy dual interpretation of unknown quantity being
estimated; 2) the principle of selecting sigma-max operator for practical
problems, such as estimation and recognition. Our perspective, conceived from
definitions of randomness and fuzziness, is that continuous unknown quantity
involved in estimation with inaccurate prior should be more appropriately
modeled as randomness and handled by sigma inference; whereas discrete unknown
quantity involved in recognition with insufficient (and inaccurate) prior could
be better modeled as fuzziness and handled by max inference. The philosophy was
demonstrated by an updated version of the well-known interacting multiple model
(IMM) filter, for which the jump Markovian System is reformulated as a hybrid
uncertainty system, with continuous state evolution modeled as usual as
model-conditioned stochastic system and discrete mode transitions modeled as
fuzzy system by a possibility (instead of probability) transition matrix, and
hypotheses mixing is conducted by using the operation of ""max"" instead of
""sigma"". For our example of maneuvering target tracking using simulated data
from both a short-range fire control radar and a long-range surveillance radar,
the updated IMM filter shows significant improvement over the classic IMM
filter, due to its peculiarity of hard decision of system model and a faster
response to the transition of discrete mode.

the system parameters as the measurement proceeds and our knowledge of the
rotation improves. We illustrate this with an example where the precision is
enhanced by a factor of more than 20 over the case without tuning, after 100

  Quasi-conformal Geometry applied to Imaging",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many imaging problems can be formulated as mapping problems. A general
mapping problem aims to obtain an optimal mapping that minimizes an energy
functional subject to the given constraints. Existing methods to solve the
mapping problems are often inefficient and can sometimes get trapped in local
minima. An extra challenge arises when the optimal mapping is required to be
diffeomorphic. In this work, we address the problem by proposing a
deep-learning framework based on the Quasiconformal (QC) Teichmuller theories.
The main strategy is to learn the Beltrami coefficient (BC) that represents a
mapping as the latent feature vector in the deep neural network. The BC
measures the local geometric distortion under the mapping, with which the
interpretability of the deep neural network can be enhanced. Under this
framework, the diffeomorphic property of the mapping can be controlled via a
simple activation function within the network. The optimal mapping can also be
easily regularized by integrating the BC into the loss function. A crucial
advantage of the proposed framework is that once the network is successfully
trained, the optimized mapping corresponding to each input data information can
be obtained in real time. To examine the efficacy of the proposed framework, we

BenDaniel-Duke setting and the same spectrum as the standard harmonic

network science applications. To efficiently manage learning over graphs,
variants of graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed recently. By
succinctly encoding local graph structures and features of nodes,
state-of-the-art GNNs can scale linearly with the size of graph. Despite their
success in practice, most of existing methods are unable to handle graphs with
uncertain nodal attributes. Specifically whenever mismatches between training
and testing data distribution exists, these models fail in practice. Challenges
also arise due to distributional uncertainties associated with data acquired by
noisy measurements. In this context, a distributionally robust learning
framework is developed, where the objective is to train models that exhibit
quantifiable robustness against perturbations. The data distribution is
considered unknown, but lies within a Wasserstein ball centered around
empirical data distribution. A robust model is obtained by minimizing the worst
expected loss over this ball. However, solving the emerging functional
optimization problem is challenging, if not impossible. Advocating a strong
duality condition, we develop a principled method that renders the problem
tractable and efficiently solvable. Experiments assess the performance of the
proposed method.

Instabilities of markedly different nature are found to dominate in different
flow velocity regimes. For moderate velocities where the two flows are
subsonic, the vortex lattice displays a quantized version of the hydrodynamic
Kelvin--Helmholtz instability (KHI), with the vortices rolling up and
co-rotating. For supersonic flow velocities, the oscillation involved in the
KHI can resonantly couple to acoustic excitations propagating away in the bulk
fluid on both sides. This makes the KHI rate to be effectively suppressed and
other mechanisms to dominate: For finite and relatively small systems along the
transverse direction, the instability involves a repeated superradiant
scattering of sound waves off the vortex lattice; for transversally unbound
systems, a radiative instability dominates, leading to the simultaneous growth
of a localized wave along the vortex lattice and of acoustic excitations
propagating away in the bulk. Finally, for slow velocities, where the KHI rate
is intrinsically slow, another instability associated to the rigid lateral
displacement of the vortex lattice due to the vicinity of the system's boundary
is found to dominate.

insulators. This molecular orbital interpretation of topology has been
enlightening and was recently extended to topological crystalline insulators
which include obstructions tied to space group symmetries. In this article, we
introduce a new class of two-dimensional topological materials known as optical
$N$-insulators that possess obstructions to constructing localized molecular

eigenvectors of the susceptibility tensor -- which constitutes the collection
of optical Bloch functions. The localized basis of these eigenvectors are
optical Wannier functions which represent the molecular polarizabilities at
different lattice sites. We prove that in a nontrivial optical phase $N\neq 0$,
such a localized polarization basis is impossible to construct. Utilizing the

coupled to a bath is, in general, an athermal state, we introduce and study a
cyclic battery-charger quantum device that is in thermal equilibrium, or in a
ground state, during the charge storing stage. The cycle has four stages: the
equilibrium storage stage is interrupted by disconnecting the battery from the
charger, then work is extracted from the battery, and then the battery is
reconnected with the charger; finally, the system is brought back to
equilibrium. At no point during the cycle are the battery-charger correlations
artificially erased. We study the case where the battery and charger together
comprise a spin-1/2 Ising chain, and show that the main figures of merit - the
extracted energy and the thermodynamic efficiency - can be enhanced by
operating the cycle close to the quantum phase transition point. When the
battery is just a single spin, we find that the output work and efficiency show
a scaling behavior at criticality and derive the corresponding critical
exponents. Due to always present correlations between the battery and the
charger, operations that are equivalent from the perspective of the battery can
entail different energetic costs for switching the battery-charger coupling.
This happens only when the coupling term does not commute with the battery's
bare Hamiltonian, and we use this purely quantum leverage to further optimize
the performance of the device.

To protect against RowHammer, vendors commit to security-through-obscurity:
modern DRAM chips rely on undocumented, proprietary, on-die mitigations,
commonly known as Target Row Refresh (TRR). At a high level, TRR detects and
refreshes potential RowHammer-victim rows, but its exact implementations are
not openly disclosed. Security guarantees of TRR mechanisms cannot be easily
studied due to their proprietary nature.
  To assess the security guarantees of recent DRAM chips, we present Uncovering
TRR (U-TRR), an experimental methodology to analyze in-DRAM TRR
implementations. U-TRR is based on the new observation that data retention
failures in DRAM enable a side channel that leaks information on how TRR
refreshes potential victim rows. U-TRR allows us to (i) understand how logical
DRAM rows are laid out physically in silicon; (ii) study undocumented on-die
TRR mechanisms; and (iii) combine (i) and (ii) to evaluate the RowHammer
security guarantees of modern DRAM chips. We show how U-TRR allows us to craft
RowHammer access patterns that successfully circumvent the TRR mechanisms
employed in 45 DRAM modules of the three major DRAM vendors. We find that the
DRAM modules we analyze are vulnerable to RowHammer, having bit flips in up to
99.9% of all DRAM rows. We make U-TRR source code openly and freely available

interest. They can (also) be understood as generalisations of the classical
spaces $A^s_{p,q} (\mathbb{R}^n)$, $A\in \{B,F\}$, in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where the
parameters satisfy $s\in \mathbb{R}$ (smoothness), $0<p \le \infty$
(integrability) and $0<q \le \infty$ (summability). In the case of Morrey
smoothness spaces additional parameters are involved. In our opinion, among the
various approaches at least two scales enjoy special attention, also in view of
applications: the scales $\mathcal{A}^s_{u,p,q} (\mathbb{R}^n)$, with
$\mathcal{A}\in \{\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}\}$, $u\geq p$, and $A^{s,
\tau}_{p,q} (\mathbb{R}^n)$, with $\tau\geq 0$.
  We reorganise these two prominent types of Morrey smoothness spaces by adding
to $(s,p,q)$ the so--called slope parameter $\varrho$, preferably (but not
exclusively) with $-n \le \varrho <0$. It comes out that $|\varrho|$ replaces
$n$, and $\min (|\varrho|,1)$ replaces 1 in slopes of (broken) lines in the $(
\frac{1}{p}, s)$--diagram characterising distinguished properties of the spaces
$A^s_{p,q} (\mathbb{R}^n)$ and their Morrey counterparts. Special attention
will be paid to low--slope spaces with $-1 <\varrho <0$, where corresponding
properties are quite often independent of $n\in \mathbb{N}$.
  Our aim is two--fold. On the one hand we reformulate some assertions already
available in the literature (many of them are quite recent). On the other hand
we establish on this basis new properties, a few of them became visible only in
the context of the offered new approach, governed, now, by the four parameters

dynamics of two superfluid helium nanodroplets hosting vortex lines in
different relative orientations, which are drawn towards each other by the Van
der Waals mutual attraction. We have found a rich phenomenology depending on
how the vortex lines are oriented. In particular, when a vortex and anti-vortex
lines are present in the merging droplets, a dark soliton develops at the
droplet contact region, which eventually decays into vortex rings. Reconnection
events are observed between the vortex lines or rings, leading to the creation
of more vortices. Our simulations show the interplay between vortex creation
and reconnections, as well as the effect of the droplet surface which pins the
vortex ends and, by reflecting short-wavelength excitations produced by the
interactions between vortices, strongly affects the droplet final state.
Additional vorticity is nucleated in the proximity of surface indentations
produced in the course of the dynamics, which in turn interact with other
vortices present in the droplets. These effects, obviously absent in the case
of bulk liquid helium, show that the droplet surface may act as a multiplier of
vortex reconnections. The analysis of the energy spectrum shows that
vortex-antivortex ring annihilation, as well as vortex-antivortex
reconnections, yields roton bursts of different intensity.

the fact that Markov Potential Games do not have unique optimal values (as

singlet. One of the best order parameter candidates in light of these new
experiments is a chiral d-wave state with $d_{xz}+id_{yz}$ symmetry. This order
parameter has been overlooked given the strong two-dimensional character of the
normal state electronic structure. Recently, a phenomenological proposal based
on local interactions with a three-dimensional electronic structure showed that
a chiral d-wave state can be stable in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ once momentum-dependent
spin-orbit coupling is properly taken into account. Here we discuss the origin
of the nodes and dips in this order parameter as inherited from the normal

The proposed methods are model-based regression trees (MOB), multivariate
adaptive regression splines (MARS), the patient rule-induction method (PRIM)

generalized Nash equilibrium problems are considered, in which the feasible set

realized via the existence of one (or more) state constraint(s) establishing a
link between the players. Special emphasis is put on the situation of a state
encoded in a possibly non-linear operator equation. First order optimality
conditions under a constraint qualification are derived. Aiming at a
practically meaningful method, an approximation scheme using a penalization
technique leading to a sequence of (Nash) equilibrium problems without
dependence of the constraint set on the other players' strategies is
established. An associated path-following strategy related to a value function
is then proposed. This happens at first on the most abstract level and is
subsequently established to a narrower framework geared to the presence of
partial differential equations in the constraint. Our findings are illustrated

vision-language (VL) transformers has outperformed existing methods for
text-image retrieval. However, when the same paradigm is used for inference,
the efficiency of the VL transformers is still too low to be applied in a real

method, the cross-model retrieval is separated into two stages: the VL
transformer learning stage, and the VL decomposition stage. The latter stage
plays the role of single modal indexing, which is to some extent like the term
indexing of a text SE. The model learns cross-modal knowledge from
early-interaction pre-training and is then decomposed into an individual
encoder. The decomposition requires only small target datasets for supervision
and achieves both $1000+$ times acceleration and less than $0.6$\% average

The model includes dust sublimation and radiative transfer with the

accretion heating can have a large impact: For accretion rates above 5*10^(-8)

sufficiently high temperature to sublimate the dust and form a gaseous cavity.
Assuming a Prandtl number ~ 0.7, it is furthermore shown that the turbulent

2010, Nikiforov proposed a Brualdi-Solheid-Tur\'{a}n type problem: what is the
maximum spectral radius of an $H$-free graph of order $n$? In this paper, we
consider the Brualdi-Solheid-Tur\'{a}n type problem for non-bipartite graphs.
Let $K_{a, b}\bullet K_3$ denote the graph obtained by identifying a vertex of
$K_{a,b}$ in the part of size $b$ and a vertex of $K_3$. We prove that if $G$
is a non-bipartite graph of order $n$ satisfying $\rho(G)\geq
\rho(K_{\lceil\frac{n-2}{2}\rceil, \lfloor\frac{n-2}{2}\rfloor}\bullet K_3)$,

components. Five components are linked to the games/design mechanics, and one
component, `Theory', that supports the design's cognitive principles, including
players' motivation. The model is used to design serious cyber games and goes
through five stages, from identifying and segmenting target players, steps to
creating game mechanics linked to pedagogy instruction and then to testing to
create a serious game that is designed to achieve the games learning

motion of many swimmers can appear smooth, with their trajectories appearing
almost ballistic in nature and slowly varying in character. These long-time
behaviours, however, often mask more complex dynamics, such as the side-to-side
snakelike motion exhibited by spermatozoa as they swim, propelled by the
frequent and periodic beating of their flagellum. Many models of motion neglect
these effects in favour of smoother long-term behaviours, which are often of
greater practical interest than the small-scale oscillatory motion. Whilst it
may be tempting to ignore any yawing motion, simply assuming that any effects
of rapid oscillations cancel out over a period, a precise quantification of the
impacts of high-frequency yawing is lacking. In this study, we systematically
evaluate the long-term effects of general high-frequency oscillations on
translational and angular motion, cast in the context of microswimmers but
applicable more generally. Via a multiple-scales asymptotic analysis, we show
that rapid oscillations can cause a long-term bias in the average direction of
progression. We identify sufficient conditions for an unbiased long-term effect
of yawing, and we quantify how yawing modifies the speed of propulsion and the
effective hydrodynamic shape when in shear flow. Furthermore, we investigate
and justify the long-time validity of the derived leading-order solutions and,
by direct computational simulation, we evidence the relevance of the presented
results to a canonical microswimmer.

model for interface debonding and a phase field model for matrix cracking. The
features of this framework are: (1) crack nucleation, propagation, and
branching can be easily tracked without the need of geometric programming; (2)
the interface debonding is determined merely by the CZM, but not interfered by
the phase field in the bulk; (3) the cohesive interface has zero thickness
instead of being regularized; (4) any reasonable cohesive law of interest is
readily incorporated with very few constraints; (5) elastoplasticity of the
matrix is conveniently taken into account, as strains in the model are all well
defined; (6) the competition of the two failure mechanisms, namely, matrix
cracking and interface debonding, is accurately captured. Accuracy of this
framework is verified with existing analytical and numerical results. The

shrinkage due to pooling, urban-scene image itself has intrinsic features like
positional patterns [3]. Our project seeks an advanced and integrated solution
that specifically targets urban-scene image semantic segmentation among the
most novel approaches in the current field. We re-implement the cutting edge

Based upon DeepLabv3+, we incorporate HANet [3] to account for the vertical

performance, we further explore the Atrous Spatial Pooling (ASP) layer in
DeepLabv3+ and infuse a computational efficient variation called ""Waterfall""

identifies height-driven patterns and improves per-class IoU of common class
labels in urban scenario like fence and bus. We also demonstrate the
improvement of model efficiency with help of WASP in terms of computational

novel dataset on internet display advertising auctions that exploits a
staggered adoption by different publishers (sellers) of first-price auctions
(FPAs), instead of the traditional second-price auctions (SPAs). Event study
regression estimates indicate that, immediately after the auction format
change, the revenue per sold impression (price) jumped considerably for the
treated publishers relative to the control publishers, ranging from 35% to 75%
of the pre-treatment price level of the treatment group. Further, we observe
that in later auction format changes the increase in the price levels under
FPAs relative to price levels under SPAs dissipates over time, reminiscent of
the celebrated revenue equivalence theorem. We take this as evidence of
initially insufficient bid shading after the format change rather than an
immediate shift to a new Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Prices then went down as
bidders learned to shade their bids. We also show that bidders' sophistication
impacted their response to the auction format change. Our work constitutes one
of the first field studies on bidders' responses to auction format changes,
providing an important complement to theoretical model predictions. As such, it

half a dozen anomalies relative to comets or asteroids in the Solar system. All
natural-origin interpretations of the Oumuamua anomalies contemplated objects
of a type never-seen-before, such as: a porous cloud of dust particles, a tidal
disruption fragment or exotic icebergs made of pure hydrogen or pure nitrogen.
Each of these natural-origin models has major quantitative shortcomings, and so
the possibility of an artificial origin for `Oumuamua must be considered. The
Galileo Project aims to collect new data that will identify the nature of
`Oumuamua-like objects in the coming years.

dynamic stochastic model with quasilinear payoffs and private values, using the
solution concept of perfect Bayesian equilibrium. We show that this
implementation is not robust in multiple senses, especially for at least 3
agents. For example, we will show a generic setup where all efficient strategy
profiles can be eliminated by iterative elimination of weakly dominated
strategies. Furthermore, this model used strong assumptions about the
information of the agents, and the mechanism was not robust to the relaxation
of these assumptions. In this paper, we will show a different mechanism that
implements efficiency under weaker assumptions and uses the stronger solution
concept of ``efficient Nash equilibrium with guaranteed expected payoffs''.

can provide a better understanding of the effects of urbanization on
psychological well-being in a country that has rapidly grown economically in
the last two decades. This paper studies linguistic differences in the
experiences and expressions of stress in urban-rural China from Weibo posts
from over 65,000 users across 329 counties using hierarchical mixed-effects
models. We analyzed phrases, topical themes, and psycho-linguistic word choices
in Weibo posts mentioning stress to better understand appraisal differences
surrounding psychological stress in urban and rural communities in China; we
then compared them with large-scale polls from Gallup. After controlling for
socioeconomic and gender differences, we found that rural communities tend to
express stress in emotional and personal themes such as relationships, health,
and opportunity while users in urban areas express stress using relative,
temporal, and external themes such as work, politics, and economics. These
differences exist beyond controlling for GDP and urbanization, indicating a
fundamentally different lifestyle between rural and urban residents in very
specific environments, arguably having different sources of stress. We found
corroborative trends in physical, financial, and social wellness with
urbanization in Gallup polls.

application to aid ambulance paramedics during CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary
Resuscitation). It must be able to work both on iOS and Android devices, which
are the leading platforms in the mobile industry. The goal of the application
is to guide paramedics in the different processes and expected medication to be
administered during a cardiac arrest, a scenario that is usually stressful and
fast-paced, thus prone to errors or distractions. The tool must provide timely
reminders of the different actions to be performed during a cardiac arrest, and
in an appropriate order, based on the results of the previous actions. A timer
function will also control the duration of each step of the CPR procedure. The
application is implemented in React Native which, using JavaScript as
programming language, allows to deploy applications that can run both in iOS
and Android native languages. Our solution could also serve as a record of
events that could be transmitted (even in real-time) to the hospital without
demanding explicit verbal communication of the procedures or medications
administered to the patient during the ambulance trip. This would provide even
higher efficiency in the process, and would allow automatic incorporation of
the events to the medical record of the patient as well.

managing various aspects of healthcare during global pandemics, as pandemics
can bring an immense strain on healthcare resources, during the pandemic. As
there is no proper study is done with regards to the proper use of IoT for
managing pandemics, in this regard, through our study we aim to review various
use cases of IoT towards managing pandemics especially in terms of COVID-19;
owing to what we are currently going through. In this regard, we are proposing
a conceptual framework synthesizing the current literature and resources, which
can be adopted when managing global pandemics to accelerate the battle pace
with these deadly pandemics and focusing on what the entire world is currently
going through where almost more than four (04) million people are diminished of

debated whether humans are able to create intelligence using technology. We
shed new light on this question from the point of view of themodynamics and
mathematics. First, we define what it is to be an agent (device) that could be
the bearer of AI. Then we show that the mainstream definitions of
`intelligence' proposed by Hutter and others and still accepted by the AI
community are too weak even to capture what is involved when we ascribe
intelligence to an insect. We then summarise the highly useful definition of
basic (arthropod) intelligence proposed by Rodney Brooks, and we identify the
properties that an AI agent would need to possess in order to be the bearer of
intelligence by this definition. Finally, we show that, from the perspective of
the disciplines needed to create such an agent, namely mathematics and physics,
these properties are realisable by neither implicit nor explicit mathematical
design nor by setting up an environment in which an AI could evolve
spontaneously.

message passing using MPI across nodes and using multithreading on the nodes
using OpenMP. The expression for communication latency and communication volume
is derived. Parallelism using work-span model is derived for shared memory
