(SSD) is widely applied in assembling telescopes to measure the charged
particles in heavy ion reactions. In this paper, we present a novel method to
achieve track recognition in the SSD telescopes of the Compact Spectrometer for
Heavy Ion Experiment (CSHINE). Each telescope consists of a single-sided
silicon strip detector (SSSSD) and a double-sided silicon strip detector
(DSSSD) backed by $3 \times 3$ CsI(Tl) crystals. Detector calibration and track
reconstruction are implemented. Special decoding algorithm is developed for the
multi-track recognition procedure to deal with the multi-hit effect convoluted
by charge sharing and the missing signals with certain probability. It is
demonstrated that the track recognition efficiency of the method is
approximately 90\% and 80\% for the DSSSD-CsI and SSSSD-DSSSD events,
respectively.

Math. Phys. 53, 022201 (2012)], we derive for a pure bipartite quantum state a
new upper bound on its maximal violation of general Bell inequalities. This new
bound indicates that, for an infinite dimensional pure bipartite state with a
finite sum of its Schmidt coefficients, violation of any general Bell
inequality is bounded from above by the value independent on a number of
settings and a type of outcomes, continuous or discrete, specific to this Bell
inequality. As an example, we apply our new general results to specifying upper
bounds on the maximal violation of general Bell inequalities by infinite
dimensional bipartite states having the Bell states like forms comprised of two
binary coherent states $|\alpha\rangle ,|-\alpha\rangle$, with $\alpha>0$. We
show that, for each of these bipartite coherent states, the maximal violation
of general Bell inequalities cannot exceed the value $3$ and analyse
numerically the dependence of the derived analytical upper bounds on a
parameter $\alpha>0$.

stone to determining the present-day Hubble constant Ho to the precision and

Cepheids in the LMC, one of the anchors of the local Distance Scale,
quadrupling the prior sample and including 68 of the 70 Cepheids used to
constrain Ho by the SH0ES program. The goal is to constrain the extent to which
the Cepheid luminosity is influenced by their chemical composition, an
important contributor to the uncertainty on the determination of the Ho itself
and a critical factor in the internal consistency of the distance ladder. We
have derived stellar parameters and abundances from a self-consistent
spectroscopic analysis based on Equivalent Width of absorption lines. The
[Fe/H] distribution of LMC Cepheids is a single Gaussian with a mean of
-0.4079+-0.003 dex (0.1 dex systematic uncertainty) and sigma 0.076+-0.003 dex.
The latter is fully compatible with the measurement error and supports the low
dispersion of 0.069 mag seen in the NIR HST LMC period-luminosity relation. The
uniformity of the abundance has the important consequence that the LMC Cepheids
alone cannot provide any meaningful constraint on the dependence of the Cepheid
Period-Luminosity relation on chemical composition at any wavelength. This
revises a prior claim based on a small sample of 22 LMC Cepheids that there was
little dependence (or uncertainty) between composition and NIR luminosity, a
conclusion which would produce a conflict between anchors of the distance
ladder with different mean abundance. The chemical homogeneity of the LMC
Cepheid population makes it an ideal environment to calibrate the metallicity
dependence between the more metal poor SMC and metal rich Milky Way and
NGC4258.

wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) based two-way
decode-and-forward (DF) relay network, where potential hardware impairments
(HIs) in all transceivers are considered. After harvesting energy and decoding
messages simultaneously via a power splitting scheme, the energy-limited relay
node forwards the decoded information to both terminals. Each terminal combines
the signals from the direct and relaying links via selection combining. We
derive the system outage probability under independent but non-identically
distributed Nakagami-m fading channels. It reveals an overall system ceiling
(OSC) effect, i.e., the system falls in outage if the target rate exceeds an
OSC threshold that is determined by the levels of HIs. Furthermore, we derive
the diversity gain of the considered network. The result reveals that when the
transmission rate is below the OSC threshold, the achieved diversity gain
equals the sum of the shape parameter of the direct link and the smaller shape
parameter of the terminal-to-relay links; otherwise, the diversity gain is
zero. This is different from the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy, under which
the relaying links have no contribution to the diversity gain. Simulation
results validate the analytical results and reveal that compared with the AF
strategy, the SWIPT based two-way relaying links under the DF strategy are more
robust to HIs and achieve a lower system outage probability.

  Transition Matrix",,"The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2021",,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep-learning-based image classification frameworks often suffer from the
noisy label problem caused by the inter-observer variation. Recent studies
employed learning-to-learn paradigms (e.g., Co-teaching and JoCoR) to filter
the samples with noisy labels from the training set. However, most of them use
a simple cross-entropy loss as the criterion for noisy label identification.
The hard samples, which are beneficial for classifier learning, are often
mistakenly treated as noises in such a setting since both the hard samples and
ones with noisy labels lead to a relatively larger loss value than the easy
cases. In this paper, we propose a plugin module, namely noise ignoring block
(NIB), consisting of a probability transition matrix and an inter-class
correlation (IC) loss, to separate the hard samples from the mislabeled ones,
and further boost the accuracy of image classification network trained with
noisy labels. Concretely, our IC loss is calculated as Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the network prediction and the accumulative soft label
generated by the probability transition matrix. Such that, with the lower value
of IC loss, the hard cases can be easily distinguished from mislabeled cases.
Extensive experiments are conducted on natural and medical image datasets

workhorse, displaying increasingly fluent generation capabilities and proving
to be an indispensable means of knowledge transfer downstream. Due to the

techniques (e.g., data augmentation, dropout) have shown much success on large

these techniques hurt the performance of tiny neural networks. We argue that
training tiny models are different from large models: rather than augmenting
the data, we should augment the model, since tiny models tend to suffer from
under-fitting rather than over-fitting due to limited capacity. To alleviate
this issue, NetAug augments the network (reverse dropout) instead of inserting
noise into the dataset or the network. It puts the tiny model into larger
models and encourages it to work as a sub-model of larger models to get extra
supervision, in addition to functioning as an independent model. At test time,
only the tiny model is used for inference, incurring zero inference overhead.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of NetAug on image classification and object
detection. NetAug consistently improves the performance of tiny models,
achieving up to 2.2% accuracy improvement on ImageNet. On object detection,
achieving the same level of performance, NetAug requires 41% fewer MACs on

$\sigma, \omega, \rho, \sigma^*$, and $\phi$ mesons. Quark matter is assumed to
be in either the CFL or the 2SC+s color superconducting phase. The possibility
of sequential (hadron-quark, quark-quark) transitions in ultra-dense matter is
investigated. Observed data related to massive pulsars, gravitational-wave

vertices of $G$ and, at each turn, the spy may move with speed $s$ (along at
most $s$ edges) and each guard may move along one edge. The spy and the guards
may occupy the same vertices. The spy wins if she reaches a vertex at distance
more than the surveilling distance $d$ from every guard. This game was
introduced by Cohen et al. in 2016 and is related to two well-studied games:
Cops and robber game and Eternal Dominating game. The guard number
$gn_{s,d}(G)$ is the minimum number of guards such that the guards have a
winning strategy (of controlling the spy) in the graph $G$. In 2018, it was
proved that deciding if the spy has a winning strategy is NP-hard for every
speed $s\geq 2$ and distance $d\geq 0$. In this paper, we initiate the
investigation of the guard number in grids and in graph products. We obtain a
strict upper bound on the strong product of two general graphs and obtain
examples with King grids that match this bound and other examples for which the
guard number is smaller. We also obtain the exact value of the guard number in
the lexicographical product of two general graphs for any distance $d\geq 2$.
From the algorithmic point of view, we prove a positive result: if the number
$k$ of guards is fixed, the spy game is solvable in polynomial XP time
$O(n^{3k+2})$ for every speed $s\geq 2$ and distance $d\geq 0$. In other words,
the spy game is XP when parameterized by the number of guards. This XP
algorithm is used to obtain an FPT algorithm on the $P_4$-fewness of the graph.
As a negative result, we prove that the spy game is W[2]-hard even in bipartite
graphs when parameterized by the number of guards, for every speed $s\geq 2$
and distance $d\geq 0$, extending the hardness result of Cohen et al. in 2018.

a function of day of the year for 1993-2015 and across a broad spectrum of
current speed. Regardless of the division of collocations, it is difficult to
claim that any synoptic assessment can be based on independent observations.
Instead, a measurement model that departs from ordinary linear regression by
accommodating error correlation is proposed. The interpretation of independence
is explored by applying Fuller's (1987) concept of equation and measurement
error to a division of error into shared (correlated) and unshared
(uncorrelated) components, respectively. The resulting division of variance in
the new model favours noise. Ocean current shared (equation) error is of
comparable magnitude to unshared (measurement) error and the latter is, for
GlobCurrent and drifters respectively, comparable to ordinary and reverse
linear regression. Although signal variance appears to be small, its utility as
a measure of agreement between two variates is highlighted.
  Sparse collocations that sample a dense grid permit a first order
autoregressive form of measurement model to be considered, including
parameterizations of analysis-in situ error cross-correlation and analysis
temporal error autocorrelation. The former (cross-correlation) is an equation
error term that accommodates error shared by both GlobCurrent and drifters. The
latter (autocorrelation) facilitates an identification and retrieval of all
model parameters. Solutions are sought using a prescribed calibration between
GlobCurrent and drifters (by variance matching). Because the true current
variance of GlobCurrent and drifters is small, signal to noise ratio is near
zero at best. This is particularly evident for moderate current speed and
meridional current component.

9.6x, and 4.2x lower Failures-In-Time (FIT) rate on average for the same amount
of protected memory compared to uniform, bit-position, and

statistical FI. Finally, we use the CEF to formulate guidelines for designing
soft-error resilient MPAs.

environment implemented in most networks, and their results give an exact
expression for the mean of the aggregate loss but only a rough upper bound for
the variance. In this paper, we consider a bidirectional version of their
percolation model in which the contagion spreads through the edges of the

neutron-star matter below nuclear saturation density, a coupling potential
between the $\omega$ and $\rho$ meson fields is introduced. This approach is
inspired by the baryon density and isospin density-dependent repulsive Skyrme
force of asymmetric nuclear matter. In isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter, the
system shows nucleation, as nucleons are arranged into shapes resembling
nuclear pasta. The dependence of clusterization in the system on the isospin
properties is also explored by calculating two-point correlation functions. We
show that, as compared to previous results that did not involve the
$\omega$-$\rho$ potential, the energy symmetry slope $L$ is successfully
controlled by varying the $\omega$-$\rho$ coupling strength. Nevertheless, the
effect of changing the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy $L$ on the
crust-core transition density does not seem significant. To the knowledge of
the authors, This is the first implementation of a $\omega$-$\rho$ coupling in
a QMD model for the inner crust of neutron stars.

However, in the healthcare domain, drug representations have been underused

complexity of high dimensional drug representations and the lack of proper
pipeline that will allow to convert clinical drugs to their representations.
Time-varying vital signs, laboratory measurements, and related time-series
signals are commonly used to predict clinical outcomes. In this work, we
demonstrated that using clinical drug representations in addition to other
clinical features has significant potential to increase the performance of
mortality and length of stay (LOS) models. We evaluate the two different drug
representation methods (Extended-Connectivity Fingerprint-ECFP and
SMILES-Transformer embedding) on clinical outcome predictions. The results have
shown that the proposed multimodal approach achieves substantial enhancement on
clinical tasks over baseline models. Using clinical drug representations as
additional features improve the LOS prediction for Area Under the Receiver

Curve (AUPRC) by around %5. Furthermore, for the mortality prediction task,
there is an improvement of around %2 over the time series baseline in terms of
AUROC and %3.5 in terms of AUPRC. The code for the proposed method is available

theory: why do deep networks generalize well even while being
overparameterized, unregularized and fitting the training data to zero error?
  In the first part of the thesis, we will empirically study how training deep
networks via stochastic gradient descent implicitly controls the networks'
capacity. Subsequently, to show how this leads to better generalization, we
will derive {\em data-dependent} {\em uniform-convergence-based} generalization
bounds with improved dependencies on the parameter count.
  Uniform convergence has in fact been the most widely used tool in deep
learning literature, thanks to its simplicity and generality. Given its
popularity, in this thesis, we will also take a step back to identify the
fundamental limits of uniform convergence as a tool to explain generalization.
In particular, we will show that in some example overparameterized settings,
{\em any} uniform convergence bound will provide only a vacuous generalization
bound.
  With this realization in mind, in the last part of the thesis, we will change
course and introduce an {\em empirical} technique to estimate generalization
using unlabeled data. Our technique does not rely on any notion of
uniform-convergece-based complexity and is remarkably precise. We will
theoretically show why our technique enjoys such precision.
  We will conclude by discussing how future work could explore novel ways to
incorporate distributional assumptions in generalization bounds (such as in the
form of unlabeled data) and explore other tools to derive bounds, perhaps by
modifying uniform convergence or by developing completely new tools altogether.

valence electron is emitted into the ionization continuum. Because of this
coupling to the continuum, core-vacant states represent electronic resonances
that can be tackled with standard quantum-chemical methods only if they are
approximated as bound states, meaning that Auger decay is neglected. Here, we
present an approach to compute Auger decay rates of core-vacant states from

with complex scaling of the Hamiltonian or, alternatively, complex-scaled basis
functions. Through energy decomposition analysis, we illustrate how
complex-scaled methods are capable of describing the coupling to the ionization

explicitly. In addition, we introduce in this work several approaches for the
determination of partial decay widths and Auger branching ratios from
complex-scaled coupled-cluster wave functions. We demonstrate the capabilities
of our new approach by computations on core-ionized states of neon, water,
dinitrogen, and benzene. Coupled-cluster and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster
theory in the singles and doubles approximation both deliver excellent results

evaluate with the former method. We also observe that the requirements towards
the basis set are less arduous for Auger decay than for other types of
resonances so that extensions to larger molecules are readily possible.

this measure. In addition, there is the need for a scalable way to estimate

of energy smart meters and WiFi infrastructure in commercial buildings. We
estimate the schedules by clustering WiFi-derived occupancy profiles and,
energy savings by shifting ramp-up and setback times observed in
typical/measured load profiles obtained by clustering smart meter energy
profiles. Our case-study results with five buildings over seven months show an

they can distort or modify biometric features, severely affecting the
capability of recognizing individuals' identity or even detecting the face.
Accordingly, we address the effect of such filters on the accuracy of automated
face detection and recognition. The social media image filters studied either
modify the image contrast or illumination or occlude parts of the face with for
example artificial glasses or animal noses. We observe that the effect of some
of these filters is harmful both to face detection and identity recognition,
specially if they obfuscate the eye or (to a lesser extent) the nose. To
counteract such effect, we develop a method to reconstruct the applied
manipulation with a modified version of the U-NET segmentation network. This is
observed to contribute to a better face detection and recognition accuracy.
From a recognition perspective, we employ distance measures and trained machine
learning algorithms applied to features extracted using a ResNet-34 network
trained to recognize faces. We also evaluate if incorporating filtered images
to the training set of machine learning approaches are beneficial for identity
recognition. Our results show good recognition when filters do not occlude
important landmarks, specially the eyes (identification accuracy >99%, EER<2%).
The combined effect of the proposed approaches also allow to mitigate the
effect produced by filters that occlude parts of the face, achieving an

the assumptions and sources of variation for consideration in these two papers

some data from the testing distribution available at the training stage. We
show that under the assumption that the sample sizes from training and testing
are growing in the same order, efficient value function estimates can deliver
competitive performance. We further show some connections of these estimates
with existing literature. However, when the growth of testing sample size
available for training is in a slower order, efficient value function estimates
may not perform well anymore. In contrast, the requirement of the testing
sample size for DRITR is not as strong as that of efficient policy evaluation
using the combined data. Finally, we highlight the general applicability and
usefulness of DRITR in Section 3.

Do these materials have appreciable oxygen charge-transfer character akin to
the cuprates, or are they in a distinct Mott-Hubbard regime where oxygen plays
a minimal role? Here, we resolve this question using O $K$-edge resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of the low valence nickelate
La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{8}$ and a prototypical cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$

the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen scheme. The nickelate, however, is not well described
by either limit of the ZSA scheme and is found to be of mixed
charge-transfer/Mott-Hubbard character with the Coulomb repulsion $U$ of
similar size to the charge-transfer energy $\Delta$. Nevertheless, the
transition-metal-oxygen hopping is larger in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{8}$ than in

to handle all noisy images in a pre-defined static network architecture, which
inevitably leads to high computational complexity for good denoising quality.
Here, we present dynamic slimmable denoising network (DDS-Net), a general
method to achieve good denoising quality with less computational complexity,
via dynamically adjusting the channel configurations of networks at test time
with respect to different noisy images. Our DDS-Net is empowered with the
ability of dynamic inference by a dynamic gate, which can predictively adjust
the channel configuration of networks with negligible extra computation cost.
To ensure the performance of each candidate sub-network and the fairness of the
dynamic gate, we propose a three-stage optimization scheme. In the first stage,
we train a weight-shared slimmable super network. In the second stage, we
evaluate the trained slimmable super network in an iterative way and
progressively tailor the channel numbers of each layer with minimal denoising
quality drop. By a single pass, we can obtain several sub-networks with good
performance under different channel configurations. In the last stage, we
identify easy and hard samples in an online way and train a dynamic gate to
predictively select the corresponding sub-network with respect to different
noisy images. Extensive experiments demonstrate our DDS-Net consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art individually trained static denoising

property is presented, assuming that the statistical fluctuations in the number
of infection and recovered cases are disregarded. This effective SIR model
shows a reduced population number and a constant $\beta$ parameter. The effects
of also including the retardation between recovery and infection process is
also considered. Next, it is shown that any solution of the effective SIR also
solves the linear problem to which the SIR equations reduce when the total
population is much larger than the number of the infected cases. Then, it is
also argued that this equivalence follows for a specific contagious parameter
$\beta(t)$ which time dependence is analytically derived here. Then, two
equivalent predictive calculational methods for the infection dynamics under
stationary isolation measures are proposed. The results represent a solutions
for the known and challenging problem of defining the time dependence of the
contagion parameter, when the SIR parameter $N$ is assumed to be the whole
population number. Finally, the model is applied to describe the known

under strict stationary isolation measures. The cases of Iceland, New Zealand,
Korea and Cuba were considered. Although, non subject to stationary isolation

mining and machine learning, because it is unsupervised, can be employed in a
generic metric space, and does not have any assumptions of data distributions.
Data mining and machine learning applications face a challenge of dealing with
large datasets, which requires efficient distance-based outlier detection
algorithms. Due to the popularization of computational environments with large
memory, it is possible to build a main-memory index and detect outliers based
on it, which is a promising solution for fast distance-based outlier detection.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel approach that exploits a
proximity graph. Our approach can employ an arbitrary proximity graph and
obtains a significant speed-up against state-of-the-art. However, designing an
effective proximity graph raises a challenge, because existing proximity graphs
do not consider efficient traversal for distance-based outlier detection. To
overcome this challenge, we propose a novel proximity graph, MRPG. Our
empirical study using real datasets demonstrates that MRPG detects outliers
significantly faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

infection to its neighbors independently with probability $p$. This is also
known as the independent cascade or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model
with fixed recovery time. The size of an outbreak in this model is closely
related to that of the giant connected component in ``edge percolation'', where
each edge of the graph is kept independently with probability $p$, studied for
a large class of networks including configuration model
\cite{molloy2011critical} and preferential attachment
\cite{bollobas2003,Riordan2005}. Even though these models capture the effects
of degree inhomogeneity and the role of super-spreaders in the spread of an
epidemic, they only consider graphs that are locally tree like i.e. have a few
or no short cycles. Some generalizations of the configuration model were
suggested to capture local communities, known as household models
\cite{ball2009threshold}, or hierarchical configuration model
\cite{Hofstad2015hierarchical}.
  Here, we ask a different question: what information is needed for general

(also known as Benjamini-Schramm limits). In particular, we show that there is
an algorithm which gives a $(1-\epsilon)$ approximation of the probability and
the final size of an outbreak by accessing a constant-size neighborhood of a

learn to rearrange the configuration of the DLO based on the detected

problem in a coarse-to-fine manner (with high-level task planning and low-level

deformation properties is avoided since the algorithm replans its motion after
each bimanual execution. The conducted experimental results reveal that our

they are plagued with instability in their training dynamics. In this work, we
address this issue by introducing a novel self-supervised loss that encourages

centralized policy, conditioned on a learned latent interaction graph. We show
that our method (SS-MAIL) outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on

enable the detection of several large redshift GW sources by third-generation
GW detectors. These advancements provide an independent method to probe the
large-scale structure of the universe by using the clustering of the binary
black holes. The black hole catalogs are complementary to the galaxy catalogs
because of large redshifts of GW events, which may imply that binary black
holes (BBHs) are a better choice than galaxies to probe the large-scale
structure of the universe and cosmic evolution over a large redshift range. To
probe the large-scale structure, we used the sky position of the binary black
holes observed by third-generation GW detectors to calculate the angular
correlation function (ACF) and the bias factor of the population of binary
black holes. This method is also statistically significant as 5000 BBHs are
simulated. Moreover, for the third-generation GW detectors, we found that the
bias factor can be recovered to within 33$\%$ with an observational time of ten
years. This method only depends on the GW source-location posteriors; hence, it
can be an independent method to reveal the formation mechanisms and origin of
the BBH mergers compared to the electromagnetic method.

its performance over history. We show that for a variety of MGs, players in our
learning scheme will provably converge to a point that is an approximation to
Nash equilibrium. Combined with neural networks, we develop the \emph{empirical

location information assisted beamforming design without the requirement of the

relation between the channel model and the user location, based on which we
derive an approximate CSI error bound based on the user location error by means
of Taylor approximation, triangle and power mean inequalities, and semidefinite
relaxation (SDR). Second, for combating the uncertainty of the location error,
we formulate a worst-case robust beamforming optimization problem. To solve the
problem efficiently, we develop a novel iterative algorithm by utilizing
various optimization tools such as Lagrange multiplier, matrix inversion lemma,
SDR, as well as branch-and-bound (BnB). Additionally, we provide sufficient
conditions for the SDR to output rank-one solutions, and modify the BnB
algorithm to acquire the phase shift solution under an arbitrary constraint of
possible phase shift values. Finally, we analyse the algorithm convergence and
complexity, and carry out simulations to validate the theoretical derivation of
the CSI error bound and the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with
the existing non-robust approach and the robust beamforming techniques based on
S-procedure and penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP), our method can converge
more quickly and achieve better performance in terms of the worst-case

extremely short intrinsic duration. Until now, the physical origins of them
still remain elusive especially for the non-repeating FRBs. Strongly inspired
by recent progress on possible evidence of Earth-mass primordial black holes,
we revisit the model of Earth-mass primordial black holes mergers as sources
for non-repeating FRBs. Under the null hypothesis that the observed
non-repeating FRBs are originated from the mergers of Earth-mass primordial
black holes, we analyzed four independent samples of non-repeating FRBs to
study the model parameters i.e. the typical charge value $q_{\rm{c}}$ and the
power index $\alpha$ of the charge distribution function of the primordial
black hole population $\phi(q) \propto (q/q_{\rm{c}})^{-\alpha}$ which describe
how the charge was distributed in the population. $q$ is the charge of
  the hole in the unit of $\sqrt{G} M$, where $M$ is the mass of the hole. It
turns out that this model can explain the observed data well. {Assuming the
monochromatic mass spectrum for primordial black holes}, we get the average
value of typical charge $\bar{q}_{\rm{c}}/10^{-5}=1.59^{+0.08}_{-0.18}$ and the
power index $\bar{\alpha}=4.53^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$ by combining the fitting
results given by four non-repeating FRB samples. The event rate of the
non-repeating FRBs can be explained in the context of this model, if the
abundance of the primordial black hole populations with charge $q \gtrsim
10^{-6}$ is larger than $10^{-5}$ which is far below the upper limit given by
current observations for the abundance of Earth-mass primordial black holes. In
the future, simultaneous detection of FRBs and high frequency gravitational
waves produced by mergers of Earth-mass primordial black holes may directly
confirm or deny this model.

also enables control of camera poses and different levels of styles, which can
generalize to unseen views. It also supports challenging tasks, including
zoom-in and-out, style mixing, inversion, and semantic editing.

static types, which paradoxically require more schema change but also provide a
mechanism to express and execute those changes. To determine those changes we
turn to structure editing, so that we can capture changes in type definitions

satisfy the linear superposition principle (LSP). Since the presentation of the
special theory of relativity, it has been commonly accepted that a famous
formula E = mc^2 = m_0c^2 /(1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2) expresses the energy of a free
particle only. However, while studying the experiment for the annihilation of
particle and antiparticle and the production of the photon in terms of the law
of energy conservation of particle and field, we obtain a conclusion that E
includes not only the energy of a free particle but also the energy of its self
-fields (electromagnetic field and gravitational field). Hence, a formula for
the energy in the special theory of relativity comes to have a more inclusive
meaning than Einstein had thought of it. Based upon such an idea and the
correspondence principle, through introducing a new non-Euclidean
four-dimensional space, so-called KR space in which the metric is the function
of coordinates and 4-velocity, we reformulate the action function to be a
function defined in the nonlinear version and from it find equation system for
a charge and the field with a modified version, which is reduced to that in the
Maxwell theory under the weak field condition: here, weak field condition is
given by |U/m_0c^2|<<1, U; interactional energy. With the equation system, we
show that the divergence problem arising from the Maxwell theory, without
invoking renormalization, is very naturally solved by sensible mathematics and
then demonstrate that the total energy of a free charge and its field equals
mc^2 and so the energy of an electrostatic field leads to the finite. In this
course are derived the modified version of Coulomb potential and of radiation
reaction without renormalization which contains an interference effect (a
nonlinear effect that does not obey LSP).

Such issues become even more challenging when considering time-bound

soft constraints to enable task relaxation. The metric interval temporal logic
(MITL) specifications are employed to deal with time-bound constraints. By
constructing a relaxed timed product automaton, an online motion planning
strategy is synthesized with a receding horizon controller to generate
policies, achieving multiple objectives in decreasing order of priority 1)
formally guarantee the satisfaction of hard safety constraints; 2) mostly
fulfill soft timed tasks; and 3) collect time-varying rewards as much as

both time and tasks for infeasible cases. Simulation results are provided to
validate the proposed approach.

viewed as a porous viscoelastic medium. In the present paper, extensive tests
against both laboratory experiments and field observations are performed to
assess this model's ability at describing wave attenuation in various types of
sea ice. The theoretical predictions are fitted to data on attenuation rate via
error minimization and numerical solution of the corresponding dispersion
relation. Detailed comparison with other existing viscoelastic theories is also
presented. Estimates for effective rheological parameters such as shear modulus
and kinematic viscosity are obtained from the fits and are found to vary
significantly among the models. For this poroelastic system, the range of
estimated values turns out to be relatively narrow in orders of magnitude over
all the cases considered. Against field measurements from the Arctic Ocean,
this model is able to reasonably reproduce the roll-over of attenuation rate as
a function of frequency. Given the rather large number of physical parameters
in such a formulation, a sensitivity analysis is also conducted to gauge the

implications for in-ice radio detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos.
Previous investigations of the effects of birefringence on the propagation of
radio-frequency signals in ice have found that it can cause time delays between
pulses in different polarizations in in-ice neutrino experiments, and can have
polarization-dependent effects on power in radar echoes at oblique angles in
polar ice. I report, for the first time, on implications for the received power
in different polarizations in high energy neutrino experiments, where the
source of the emitted signal is in the ice, a biaxial treatment at radio
wavelengths is used, and the signals propagate at oblique angles. I describe a
model for this and compare with published results from the SPICE in-ice
calibration pulser system at South Pole, where unexpectedly high
cross-polarization power has been reported for some geometries. The data shows
behaviors indicative of the need for a biaxial treatment of birefringence
inducing non-trivial rotations of the signal polarization. The behaviors
include, but are not limited to, a time delay that would leave an imprint in
the power spectrum. I explain why this time delay has the potential to serve as
both an in-ice neutrino signature and a measurement of the distance to the
interaction. While further work is needed, I expect that proper handling of the
effects presented here will increase the science potential of ultra-high energy
neutrino experiments, and may impact the optimal designs of next-generation

structural complexity in living animals: that of the mechanical self-assembly
of groups of distinct multicellular organisms into dynamical, functional
structures. One of the most striking examples of such structures is the army
ant bivouac, a nest which self-assembles solely from the interconnected bodies
of hundreds of thousands of individuals. These bivouacs are difficult to study
because they rapidly disassemble when disturbed, and hence little is known
about the structure and rules that individuals follow during their formation.
Here we use a custom-built Computed Tomography scanner to investigate the
details of the internal structure and growth process of army ant bivouacs. We
show that bivouacs are heterogeneous structures, which throughout their growth
maintain a thick shell surrounding a less dense interior that contains empty
spaces akin to nest chambers. We find that ants within the bivouac do not carry
more than approximately eight times their weight regardless of the size of the
structure or their position within it. This observation suggests that bivouac
size is not limited by physical constraints of the ants' morphology. This study
brings us closer to understanding the rules used by individuals to govern the
formation of these exceptional superorganismal structures, and provides insight
into how to create engineered self-assembling systems with, for instance,
swarms of robots or active matter.

describes a method for target source extraction, called the

target source using a rough magnitude spectrogram as the reference signal. The
advantage of the SIBF is that it can obtain a more accurate signal than the
spectrogram generated by target-enhancing methods such as speech enhancement
based on deep neural networks. For the extraction, we extend the framework of
deflationary independent component analysis (ICA) by considering the
similarities between the reference and extracted target sources, in addition to
the mutual independence of all the potential sources. To solve the extraction
problem by maximum-likelihood estimation, we introduce three source models that
can reflect the similarities. The major contributions of this study are as
follows. First, the extraction performance is improved using two methods,
namely boost start for faster convergence and iterative casting for generating
a more accurate reference. The effectiveness of these methods is verified
through experiments using the CHiME3 dataset. Second, a concept of a fixed
point pertaining to accuracy is developed. This concept facilitates
understanding the relationship between the reference and SIBF output in terms
of accuracy. Third, a unified formulation of the SIBF and mask-based beamformer
is realized to apply the expertise of conventional BFs to the SIBF. The
findings of this study can also improve the performance of the SIBF and promote

based on the same datasets. Compared with GSA method, the FTSEM method obtained
more complete tree skeletons. And the time cost of the FTSEM method is
evaluated using the runtime and time per million points (TPMP). The runtime of
FTSEM is from 1.0 s to 13.0 s, and the runtime of GSA is from 6.4 s to 309.3 s.
The average value of TPMP is 1.8 s for FTSEM, and 22.3 s for GSA respectively.

the power distribution system, other challenges are the nonlinearity of the

the scale of the system. To overcome the above challenges, this paper proposes
a Bayesian-inference framework that allows us to simultaneously estimate the

Specifically, by using the very limited number of measurements available that

transductive. Inductively solving graph-related tasks with sequential actions
is accomplished by adopting graph neural networks (GNNs) coupled with
reinforcement learning under the scenario with rich graph features. However,
such frameworks cannot be directly applied to resilience tasks where only pure
topological structure is available. In this case, GNNs can barely learn useful

successively rewiring edges under a reinforcement learning context. In this

Sidorenkov (2005). This rate is lower than the mean rate of 1.78 ms/cy derived
by Stephenson et al. (2016) on the basis of eclipses in the Antiquity and

major change in the data accuracy with telescopic observations. The observed
lunar recession appears too large when compared to the tidal slowing down of
the Earth determined from eclipses in the Antiquity and Middle Age and even
much more when determined from lunar occultations and IERS data from 1680 to
2020. With a proper account of the tidal effects and of the detailed studies on
the atmospheric effects, the melting from icefields, the changes of the sea

challenging task in the field of remote sensing image analysis. The task is
non-trivial due to the following challenges: Firstly, intrinsic speckle noise
of SAR images inevitably degrades the neural network because of error gradient
accumulation. Furthermore, the correlation among various levels or scales of
feature maps is difficult to be achieved through summation or concatenation.
Toward this end, we proposed a siamese adaptive fusion network for SAR image
change detection. To be more specific, two-branch CNN is utilized to extract
high-level semantic features of multitemporal SAR images. Besides, an adaptive
fusion module is designed to adaptively combine multiscale responses in
convolutional layers. Therefore, the complementary information is exploited,
and feature learning in change detection is further improved. Moreover, a
correlation layer is designed to further explore the correlation between
multitemporal images. Thereafter, robust feature representation is utilized for
classification through a fully-connected layer with softmax. Experimental
results on four real SAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits
superior performance against several state-of-the-art methods. Our codes are

in the mass range of $\sim (6.9,7.1)$/$(19.7,19.9)$ GeV, apart for the highest
$0^{++}$ state $T_{(cc\bar{c}\bar{c})0^{++}}(7185)$/

$2S$-, or $1D$-wave $T_{cc\bar{c}\bar{c}}$ states. The vague structure
$X(7200)$ may be caused by the highest $2S$-wave state
$T_{(cc\bar{c}\bar{c})0^{++}}(7185)$, two low-lying $3S$-wave states

and/or the high-lying $1D$-wave states with masses around 7.2 GeV and
$J^{PC}=0^{++},1^{++},2^{++},3^{++}$, or $4^{++}$. While it is apparent that
the potential quark model calculations predict more states than the structures

superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ forming two domes upon
pressure-tuning. The first dome arises from the competition between
superconductivity and a charge-density-wave, whereas the origin for the second
dome remains unclear. Herein, we show that the appearance of the second
superconducting dome in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ is associated with
transitions from hexagonal $P6$/$mmm$ to monoclinic $P2$/$m$ structures,
evidenced by splitting of structural peaks from synchrotron powder X-ray
diffraction experiments and imaginary phonon frequencies in first-principles
calculations. In KV$_3$Sb$_5$, transition to an orthorhombic $Pmmm$ structure
is further observed for pressure $p\gtrsim20$ GPa, and is correlated with the
strong suppression of $T_{\rm c}$ in the second superconducting dome. Our
findings indicate distortions of the crystal structure modulates
superconductivity in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ under pressure, providing a platform to
study the emergence of superconductivity in the presence of multiple structural
instabilities.

find the most suitable position for each item by swapping misplaced item pairs.

simultaneously learn object classifiers and estimate object locations under the

multiple instance learning which regards images as bags of instances and
selects positive instances from each bag to learn the detector. However, a
grand challenge emerges when the detector inclines to converge to
discriminative parts of objects rather than the whole objects. In this paper,
under the hypothesis that optimal solutions are included in local minima, we
propose a discovery-and-selection approach fused with multiple instance

from multiple local minima. To implement DS-MIL, an attention module is
proposed so that more context information can be captured by feature maps and
more valuable proposals can be collected during training. With proposal

A natural scenario where this problem arises is in hypothesis testing on social

respectively, graphs with near-regular degree intervals, in which every node
$i$ has a degree from an interval not too far away from a given $d \in \N$. In

Markov chain theory and combinatorics. In particular, we provide the first
non-trivial algorithmic application of a breakthrough result of Liebenau and
Wormald (2017) regarding an asymptotic formula for the number of graphs with a

hinge flips, and additions/deletions of a single edge. We obtain the first
theoretical results for this Markov chain by showing it is rapidly mixing for

remarkable success, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples that are
generated by adding human-imperceptible perturbations on clean video samples.
As indicated in recent studies, adversarial examples are transferable, which
makes it feasible for black-box attacks in real-world applications.
Nevertheless, most existing adversarial attack methods have poor
transferability when attacking other video models and transfer-based attacks on
video models are still unexplored. To this end, we propose to boost the
transferability of video adversarial examples for black-box attacks on video
recognition models. Through extensive analysis, we discover that different
video recognition models rely on different discriminative temporal patterns,
leading to the poor transferability of video adversarial examples. This
motivates us to introduce a temporal translation attack method, which optimizes
the adversarial perturbations over a set of temporal translated video clips. By
generating adversarial examples over translated videos, the resulting
adversarial examples are less sensitive to temporal patterns existed in the
white-box model being attacked and thus can be better transferred. Extensive
experiments on the Kinetics-400 dataset and the UCF-101 dataset demonstrate
that our method can significantly boost the transferability of video

solve the problem. We adopt an actor-critic scheme, where the action taken by
the agent is influenced by policy considerations on the state-value function.
The procedures are adapted to take into account the challenging nature of JSSP,
where the state and the action space change not only for every instance but
also after each decision. To tackle the variability in the number of jobs and
operations in the input, we modeled the agent using two incident LSTM models, a
special type of deep neural network. Experiments show the algorithm reaches
good solutions in a short time, proving that is possible to generate new greedy
heuristics just from learning-based methodologies. Benchmarks have been
generated in comparison with the commercial solver CPLEX. As expected, the
model can generalize, to some extent, to larger problems or instances
originated by a different distribution from the one used in training.

double-integrator agents are explored. The existing methods require that agents
communicate with their neighbors in real time. In this paper, we propose two
discrete-time communication schemes based on the designed continuous-time
strategy-updating rule for the efficient use of communication resources. First,
the property of the designed continuous-time rule is analyzed to ensure that
all agents' strategies can converge to the Nash equilibrium. Then, we propose
periodic and event-triggered communication schemes for the implementation of
the designed rule with discrete-time communication. The rule in the periodic
case is implemented synchronously and easily. The rule in the event-triggered
case is executed asynchronously without Zeno behaviors. All agents in both
cases can asymptotically reach to the Nash equilibrium by interacting with
neighbors at discrete times. Simulations are performed in networks of Cournot
competition to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Their atmospheres have a large scale height implying a high signal to noise
ratio. As these planets orbit close to their stars, they often present strong
thermal and chemical hetereogeneities between the day and the night side of
their atmosphere. For the hottest ones, the thermal dissociation of several
species occurs in their atmospheres which leads to a stronger chemical
dichotomy between the two hemispheres. It has already been shown that the
current retrieval algorithms, which are using 1D forward models, find biased
molecular abundances in ultra hot Jupiters. Here, we quantify the effective
temperature domain over which these biases are present. We use a set of 12
simulations of typical Hot Jupiters from Teq = 1000 K to Teq = 2100 K performed
with the Substellar and Planetary Atmospheric Radiation and Circulation global
climate model and generate transmission spectra that fully account for the 3D
structure of the atmosphere with Pytmosph3R. These spectra are then analyzed
using the 1D TauREx retrieval code. We find that for JWST-like data, accounting
for non-isothermal vertical temperature profiles is required over the whole
temperature range. We further find that 1D retrieval codes start to estimate
wrong parameter values for planets with equilibrium temperatures greater than
1400 K if there are absorbers in the visible able to create a hot stratosphere.
The high temperatures at low pressures indeed entail a thermal dissociation of
species which creates a strong chemical day-night dichotomy. As a by-product,
we demonstrate that when using synthetic observations to assess the
detectability of a given feature or process using a Bayesian framework, it is
valid to use non-randomized input data, as long as the anticipated
observational uncertainties are correctly taken into account.

varies with their thermal history a proton radiation campaign has been carried
out using a CCD280. The CCD is irradiated at 153 K and gradually warmed to 188
K in 5 K increments with Fe55 X-ray, dark current and trap pumping images taken
at 153 K after each anneal step.
  The results show that despite the trap landscape changing throughout the
anneal it has little impact on parallel charge transfer inefficiency. This is
thought to be because most traps are unaffected and a lot of those that do
anneal only move from the continuum between distinct trap species and into a
nearby divacancy trap 'peak' whose emission time constant is similar enough to
still impact the CTI.
  In terms of using a CCD280 or similar devices in a mission the CTI being
unaffected by thermal annealing up to 188 K means that any CTI correction
needed as the radiation damage builds up does not have to take into account the
thermal history of the focal plane. However, it is possible that a significant
amount of annealing will occur at temperatures greater than 188 K and care
should be taken when a mission is operating in this range to gather accurate
pre-flight data.

for capturing temporal dependencies of behavior sequences; Meta Learner for
extracting and propagating transferable knowledge of prior users and learning a
good initialization for new users. metaCSR holds the ability to learn the
common patterns from regular users' behaviors and optimize the initialization
so that the model can quickly adapt to new users after one or a few gradient

on three widely-used datasets show the remarkable performance of metaCSR in
dealing with user cold-start problem. Meanwhile, a series of qualitative
analysis demonstrates that the proposed metaCSR has good generalization.

of density field fluctuations in star-forming clouds and thus of the
correlation length $l_c(\rho)$ of these fluctuations, which can be identified
as the average size of the most correlated structures within the cloud.
Generalizing the transport equation derived by Chandrasekhar (1951) for static,
homogeneous turbulence, we show that the mass contained within these structures
is an invariant, i.e. that the average mass contained in the most correlated
structures remains constant during the evolution of the cloud, whatever
dominates the global dynamics (gravity or turbulence).
  We show that the growing impact of gravity on the turbulent flow yields an
increase of the variance of the density fluctuations and thus a drastic
decrease of the correlation length. Theoretical relations are successfully
compared to numerical simulations. This picture brings a robust support to star
formation paradigms where the mass concentration in turbulent star-forming
clouds evolves from initially large, weakly correlated filamentary structures
to smaller, denser more correlated ones, and eventually to small, tightly
correlated prestellar cores. We stress that the present results rely on a pure
statistical approach of density fluctuations and do not involve any specific
condition for the formation of prestellar cores. Interestingly enough, we show
that, under average conditions typical of Milky Way molecular clouds, this
invariant average mass is about a solar mass, providing an appealing
explanation for the apparent universality of the IMF under such environments.

the concrete and abstract networks. These characteristics are consistent with a
small-world structure. Comparisons between local node statistics and global
structural topology showed that abstract and concrete concepts present a
similar local connectivity but different overall patterns of structural
organisation with concrete concepts presenting an organisation in densely
connected communities compared to abstract concepts. These patterns confirm
previously acquired knowledge about the dichotomy of abstract and concrete
concepts on a larger scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to confirm the generalisability of these properties to the French
language and with an emphasis on abstract and concrete concepts.

intermediate and extreme mass ratios. We show that gas-driven fluctuations
imprint additional harmonic content in the GWs of the binary system, which we
dub dirty waveforms(DWs). We find three interesting observational prospects for
DWs, provided that torque fluctuations do indeed persist beyond the resolution
limit of current hydrodynamical simulations. Firstly, DWs can produce a
significant stochastic GW background, comparable to other GW noise sources.
Secondly, the energy flux implied by the additional harmonics can cause a
detectable secular phase shift in Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
sources, even if the net torque fluctuations vanish when averaged over orbital
time-scales. Lastly, the DWs of moderate-redshift nHz supermassive binaries
detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) could be detectable in the mHz range,
producing a new type of PTA-LISA multiband gravitational source. Our results
suggest that searching for DWs and their effects can potentially be a novel way
to probe the heaviest of black holes and the physics of the accretion discs
surrounding them. We find these results to be a further confirmation of the
many exciting prospects of actively searching for environmental effects within

formal or informal nature of interactions that can sometimes take place within
traditional innovation networks (Djellal \& Gallouj, 2018). For this, our
article mobilizes a public-private partnerships approach (PPPs) and the
resource-based view theory. These perspectives emphasize the complementary role
of disciplinary and incentive mechanisms as well as the exchange of specific
resources as levers for value creation. Moreover, these orientations crossed
with the perspective of a hybrid form of co-investment allow us to build a
coherent and explanatory framework of the mixed syndication phenomenon. Our
methodology is based on a qualitative approach with an interpretative aim,
which includes twenty-seven semi-structured interviews. These data were
subjected to a thematic content analysis using Nvivo software. The results
suggest that the relationships between public and private Venture capitalists
(VCs) of a formal or informal nature, more specifically in a syndication
context, at a national or regional level, are representative of an
''economico-cognitive'' (Farrugia, 2014, page 6) approach to networking and
innovation. Moreover, the phenomenon of mixed syndication reveals a context of
hybridization of public and private actors that would allow the private VCs to
benefit from the distribution of wealth when the company develops its
innovation. We can also identify a process related to a quest for legitimacy on
the part of the public actor characterized by its controlling role within the
public-private partnership (Beuve and Saussier, 2019). Finally, our study has
some limitations. One example is the measurement of the effects of
relationships on ''visible'' or ''invisible'' innovation (Djellal \& Gallouj,

to their complex geometry. Vibrational test-ing such as Process Compensated
Resonance Testing (PCRT) has shown an efficient approach, which first measures
the vibrational response of the turbine blades, and then employs a classifier
to determine if the quality of the turbine blades are good or bad. Our previous
work mainly concentrated on the development of Mahalanobis distance-based
classifiers which are fed by the measured vibrational features (such as
resonant frequencies). In practice, however, measurement errors could lead to a
biased trained classifier, potentially resulting in the wrong quality
classifications of the turbine blade. In this study, we investigate the
classification problem of turbine blades under measurement uncertainty. For
this, the concept of Interval Mahalanobis Space is employed, leading to the
Integrated Interval Mahalanobis Classification system (IIMCS) classifier which
has high robustness against measurement uncertainty. The IIMCS employs Binary
Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) to filter out those resonant frequencies
which contrib-ute most to the information in the system. A Monte Carlo
Simulation scheme is employed to analyze the sensitivity of the resonant
frequencies to the measurement uncertainty. This yields an indicator of
reliability, indicating the confidence level of the final classification
results. The developed IIMCS methodology is applied to an experimental case
study of equiaxed nickel alloy first-stage turbine blades, showing good and
robust classification performance.

estimate a column density of (2.5 +/-0.4)e12 cm-2. We derived abundances for
the corresponding cyano derivatives of cyclopentadiene and benzene and found
values significantly lower than previously reported. The rotational temperature
of the ethynyl and cyano derivatives of these cycles is about 9 K, that is,
very close to the gas kinetic temperature of the cloud. The abundance ratio of
the 1- and 2- isomers of ethynyl cyclopentadiene is 1.4 +/-0.5, while for the
two isomers of cyano cyclopentadiene it is 2.4 +/- 0.6. The relative abundances
of CCH over CN derivatives is 7.7 +/- 2.2 for cyclopentadiene, which probably
reflects the abundance ratio of the radicals CCH and CN; this ratio is only 2.1
+/- 0.5 for benzene, which suggests that additional reactions besides cyano
radicals with benzene are involved in the formation of benzonitrile. The
formation of these cycles is reasonably well accounted for through a chemical
scheme based on neutral-neutral reactions. It is predicted that benzene should
be as abundant as cyclopentadiene in TMC-1.

hydrodynamic simulations. Through a MCMC scheme, we retrieved the posterior
PDFs of all considered parameters. For ages older than about 2 Gyr, we find a
median spin-down (i.e. $P(t)\propto t^y$) of $\bar{y}=0.38_{-0.27}^{+0.38}$,
indicating a rotation decay slightly slower than classical literature values
($\approx$0.5), though still within $1\sigma$. At younger ages, we find a
median spin-down (i.e. $P(t)\propto t^x$) of $\bar{x}=0.26_{-0.19}^{+0.42}$,
which is below what is observed in young open clusters, though within
$1\sigma$. However, these two results are likely due to a selection bias as the
systems suitable to be analysed by Pasta contain at least one planet with a
hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, implying that the host star has more likely
evolved as a slow rotator. We further look for correlations between the initial
atmospheric mass fraction of the considered planets and system parameters, but
without finding any. The TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO missions are going to be
instrumental in identifying and precisely measuring systems amenable to Pasta's

problems in computer vision. Solutions to this inverse and ill-posed problem
typically involve a search for models that best explain observed image data.
Notably, images depend both on the properties of observed scenes and on the
process of image formation. Hence, if optimization techniques should be used to
explain images, it is crucial to design differentiable functions for the
projection of 3D scenes into images, also known as differentiable rendering.
Previous approaches to differentiable rendering typically replace
non-differentiable operations by smooth approximations, impacting the
subsequent 3D estimation. In this paper, we take a more general approach and
study differentiable renderers through the prism of randomized optimization and
the related notion of perturbed optimizers. In particular, our work highlights
the link between some well-known differentiable renderer formulations and
randomly smoothed optimizers, and introduces differentiable perturbed
renderers. We also propose a variance reduction mechanism to alleviate the
computational burden inherent to perturbed optimizers and introduce an adaptive
scheme to automatically adjust the smoothing parameters of the rendering
process. We apply our method to 3D scene reconstruction and demonstrate its
advantages on the tasks of 6D pose estimation and 3D mesh reconstruction. By
providing informative gradients that can be used as a strong supervisory

accurate solutions when compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives using

The training of the translator is supervised by an asymmetric modality
translation loss. Besides, an illumination normalization module based on

  transform with non-convex sparsity regularization",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Salt and pepper noise removal is a common inverse problem in image
processing. Traditional denoising methods have two limitations. First, noise
characteristics are often not described accurately. For example, the noise
location information is often ignored and the sparsity of the salt and pepper
noise is often described by L1 norm, which cannot illustrate the sparse
variables clearly. Second, conventional methods separate the contaminated image
into a recovered image and a noise part, thus resulting in recovering an image
with unsatisfied smooth parts and detail parts. In this study, we introduce a
noise detection strategy to determine the position of the noise, and a
non-convex sparsity regularization depicted by Lp quasi-norm is employed to
describe the sparsity of the noise, thereby addressing the first limitation.
The morphological component analysis framework with stationary Framelet
transform is adopted to decompose the processed image into cartoon, texture,
and noise parts to resolve the second limitation. Then, the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed to solve the proposed model.
Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the proposed method and compare it
with some current state-of-the-art denoising methods. The experimental results
show that the proposed method can remove salt and pepper noise while preserving
the details of the processed image.

  OAM Wireless Backhaul",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Orbital angular momentum (OAM) at radio frequency (RF) provides a novel
approach of multiplexing a set of orthogonal modes on the same frequency
channel to achieve high spectral efficiencies (SEs). However, the existing
research on OAM wireless communications is mainly focused on pointto-point
transmission in the line-of-sight (LoS) scenario. In this paper, we propose an
overall scheme of the downlink multi-user OAM (MU-OAM) wireless backhaul based
on uniform circular arrays (UCAs) for broadcasting networks, which can achieve
the joint spatial division and coaxial multiplexing (JSDCM). A salient feature
of the proposed downlink MU-OAM wireless backhaul systems is that the channel
matrices are completely characterized by the position of each small base
station (SBS), independent of the numbers of subcarriers and antennas, which
avoids estimating large channel matrices required by the traditional downlink
multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless backhaul systems.
Thereafter, we propose an OAM-based multiuser distance and angle of arrival
(AoA) estimation method, which is able to simultaneously estimate the positions
of multiple SBSs with a flexible number of training symbols. With the estimated
distances and AoAs, a MU-OAM preprocessing scheme is applied to eliminate the
co-mode and inter-mode interferences in the downlink MU-OAM channel. At last,
the proposed methods are extended to the downlink MU-OAM-MIMO wireless backhaul
system equipped with uniform concentric circular arrays (UCCAs), for which much
higher spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) than traditional
MU-MIMO systems can be achieved. Both mathematical analysis and simulation
results validate that the proposed scheme can effectively eliminate both
interferences of the practical downlink MU-OAM channel and approaches the
performance of the ideal MU-OAM channel.

abrupt drops in the optical luminosity of the accreting white dwarf binary
system TW Pictoris by factors up to 3.5 on time-scales as short as 30 minutes.
The optical light curve of this binary system obtained by the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) clearly displays fast switches between two
distinct intensity modes that likely track the changing mass accretion rate
onto the white dwarf. In the low mode, the system also displays
magnetically-gated accretion bursts, which implies that a weak magnetic field
of the white dwarf truncates the inner disk at the co-rotation radius in this
mode. The properties of the mode switching observed in TW Pictoris appear
analogous to those observed in transitional millisecond pulsars, where similar
transitions occur, although on timescales of ~tens of seconds. Our discovery
establishes a previously unrecognised phenomenon in accreting white dwarfs and
suggests a tight link to the physics governing magnetic accretion onto neutron

backward and forward computation, EmbRace further designs a 2D Communication
Scheduling approach which optimizes the model computation procedure, relaxes
the dependency of embeddings, and schedules the sparse communications of each

2D configurations host various type-I closed nodal lines (NLs) around the Fermi

in-plane mirror symmetries. The most intriguing NL in Al$_2$B$_2$ encloses the
K point and crosses the Fermi level with a considerable dispersion, thus
providing a fresh playground to explore exotic properties in dispersive Dirac

exhibits a high transition temperature, we provide the first evidence for a set
of 2D nonmagnetic open type-II NLs in weak spin-orbit coupling limit,
coinciding with closed type-I NLs near the Fermi level. The coexistence of
superconductivity and nontrivial band topology in AlB$_4$ not only makes it a
promising material to exhibit novel topological superconducting phases, but
also the rather large energy dispersion of type-II nodal lines in this

  Horizon Problems","International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),
  2021",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  For autonomous service robots to successfully perform long horizon tasks in
the real world, they must act intelligently in partially observable
environments. Most Task and Motion Planning approaches assume full
observability of their state space, making them ineffective in stochastic and
partially observable domains that reflect the uncertainties in the real world.
We propose an online planning and execution approach for performing long
horizon tasks in partially observable domains. Given the robot's belief and a
plan skeleton composed of symbolic actions, our approach grounds each symbolic
action by inferring continuous action parameters needed to execute the plan
successfully. To achieve this, we formulate the problem of joint inference of
action parameters as a Hybrid Constraint Satisfaction Problem (H-CSP) and solve
the H-CSP using Belief Propagation. The robot executes the resulting
parameterized actions, updates its belief of the world and replans when
necessary. Our approach is able to efficiently solve partially observable tasks
in a realistic kitchen simulation environment. Our approach outperformed an
adaptation of the state-of-the-art method across our experiments.

can be related to the consistency and connectivity of the belief network and
that the influence of specific beliefs (e.g. Satisfaction with Democracy) on a
country level has a significant negative correlation with external indicators
from the same domain (e.g. Liberal Democracy index), which suggests that highly
influential beliefs are related to pressing political issues. These findings
suggest that network-based belief influence metrics estimated from large-scale

research, which opens new avenues for integrating psychometric network analysis

a dynamical system as a sum of (spatial) basis evolving linearly in time,
allowing for a better understanding of the physical phenomena or for a future
forecasting.
  We propose in this contribution an extension of the DMD to parametrized
dynamical systems, focusing on the future forecasting of the output of interest
in a parametric context. Initially, all the snapshots -- for different
parameters and different time instants -- are projected to the reduced space,
employing the DMD (or one of its variants) to approximate the reduced snapshots
for a future instants. Still exploiting the low dimension of the reduced space,
the predicted reduced snapshots are then combined using a regression technique,
enabling the possibility to approximate any untested parametric configuration
in any future instant.
  We are going to present here the algorithmic core of the aforementioned
method, presenting at the end three different test cases with incremental
complexity: a simple dynamical system with a linear parameter dependency, a
heat problem with nonlinear parameter dependency and a fluid dynamics problem
with nonlinear parameter dependency.

incredibly accurate branch prediction. However, this comes at cost of the
increased area and complexity which is needed for modern high accuracy branch
predictors.
  The key idea described in this work is to use hyperdimensional computing and
sparse distributed memory principles to create a novel branch predictor that
can deliver complex predictions for a fraction of the current area. Sparse
distributed memories can store vast amounts of data in a compressed manner,
theoretically enabling branch histories larger and more precise than the branch
predictors used today to be stored with equal or smaller area footprint.
Furthermore, as all the data is in a hashed format and due to the nature of the
hashing scheme used, it is inherently harder to manipulate with known
side-channel attacks.

projected model counting. Despite significant advancements, however,
performance scaling remains the Achilles' heel of this field. A key idea used
in modern counters is to count models projected on an \emph{independent
support} that is often a small subset of the projection set, i.e. original set
of variables on which we wanted to project. While this idea has been effective
in scaling performance, the question of whether it can benefit to count models
projected on variables beyond the projection set, has not been explored. In
this paper, we study this question and show that contrary to intuition, it can
be beneficial to project on variables beyond the projection set. In
applications such as verification of binarized neural networks, quantification
of information flow, reliability of power grids etc., a good upper bound of the
projected model count often suffices. We show that in several such cases, we
can identify a set of variables, called upper bound support (UBS), that is not
necessarily a subset of the projection set, and yet counting models projected
on UBS guarantees an upper bound of the true projected model count.
Theoretically, a UBS can be exponentially smaller than the smallest independent
support. Our experiments show that even otherwise, UBS-based projected counting
can be more efficient than independent support-based projected counting, while
yielding bounds of very high quality. Based on extensive experiments, we find
that UBS-based projected counting can solve many problem instances that are
beyond the reach of a state-of-the-art independent support-based projected

a systematic analysis of the problem in the accurate classification of accents.
We use traditional machine learning techniques and convolutional neural

seems to hint at the possibility of a dilation of the GZK predicted opacity
sphere. It is well-known that kinematical perturbations caused by supposed
quantum gravity (QG) effects can modify the foreseen GZK opacity horizon. The
introduction of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) can indeed reduce, in some
cases making negligible, the CMB-UHECRs interaction probability. In this work
we explore the effects induced by modified kinematics in the UHECRs
phenomenology from the QG perspective. We explore the possibility of a
geometrical description of the massive fermions interaction with the supposed
quantum structure of spacetime in order to introduce a Lorentz covariance
modifification. The kinematics is amended modifying the Dispersion Relations
(DRs) of free particles in the context of a covariance-preserving framework.
This spacetime description requires a more general geometry than the usual
Riemannian one, indicating for instance the Finsler construction and the
related generalized Finsler spacetime as ideal candidates. Finally we
investigate the correlation between the magnitude of Lorentz covariance
modification and the attenuation length of the photopion production process
related to the GZK cut-off, demonstrating that the predicted opacity horizon
can be dilated even in the context of a theory that does not require any

search for new ""exotic"" physics, since the oscillation phenomenon is not
included in the original formulation of the minimal Standard Model (SM) of
particles. The confirmed observation of the neutrino oscillation phenomenon is,
therefore, the first example of physics beyond the SM and can indicate the
necessity to resort to new theoretical models. In this work, the hypothesis
that the supposed Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) perturbations can
influence the oscillation pattern is investigated. LIV theories are indeed
constructed assuming modified kinematics, caused by the interaction of massive
particles with the spacetime background. This means that the dispersion
relations are modified, so it appears natural to search for effects caused by
LIV in physical phenomena governed by masses, as in the case of neutrino
oscillations. In addition, the neutrino oscillation phenomenon is interesting
since there are three different mass eigenstates and in a LIV scenario, which
preserves isotropy, at least two different species of particle must interact.

In particular, AGN jets inflate cosmic-ray lobes, which can rise buoyantly as
light `bubbles' in the surrounding medium, displacing and heating the
encountered thermal gas and thus halting its spontaneous cooling. These bubbles
have been identified in a wide range of systems. However, due to the short
synchrotron lifetime of electrons, the most advanced phases of their evolution
have remained observationally unconstrained, preventing us to fully understand
their coupling with the external medium, and thus AGN feedback. Simple subsonic
hydrodynamic models predict that the pressure gradients, naturally present
around the buoyantly rising bubbles, transform them into toroidal structures,
resembling mushroom clouds in a stratified atmosphere. The way and timescales
on which these tori will eventually disrupt depend on various factors including
magnetic fields and plasma viscosity. Here we report LOFAR observations below

Conformal prediction (CP) addresses these issues by using the classifier's
predictions, e.g., its probability estimates, to predict confidence sets
containing the true class with a user-specified probability. However, using CP
as a separate processing step after training prevents the underlying model from
adapting to the prediction of confidence sets. Thus, this paper explores
strategies to differentiate through CP during training with the goal of
training model with the conformal wrapper end-to-end. In our approach,
conformal training (ConfTr), we specifically ""simulate"" conformalization on

average confidence set size (inefficiency) of state-of-the-art CP methods
applied after training. Moreover, it allows to ""shape"" the confidence sets

capture the structure of complex data. For tasks for which prior expert
topological knowledge is available, incorporating this into the learned
representation may lead to higher quality embeddings. For example, this may
help one to embed the data into a given number of clusters, or to accommodate
for noise that prevents one from deriving the distribution of the data over the
model directly, which can then be learned more effectively. However, a general
tool for integrating different prior topological knowledge into embeddings is
lacking. Although differentiable topology layers have been recently developed
that can (re)shape embeddings into prespecified topological models, they have
two important limitations for representation learning, which we address in this
paper. First, the currently suggested topological losses fail to represent
simple models such as clusters and flares in a natural manner. Second, these
losses neglect all original structural (such as neighborhood) information in
the data that is useful for learning. We overcome these limitations by
introducing a new set of topological losses, and proposing their usage as a way
for topologically regularizing data embeddings to naturally represent a

  Neural Networks","ICCV 2021. Code and models: https://github.com/yikaiw/SNN",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the low-bit quantization field, training Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) is
the extreme solution to ease the deployment of deep models on
resource-constrained devices, having the lowest storage cost and significantly
cheaper bit-wise operations compared to 32-bit floating-point counterparts. In
this paper, we introduce Sub-bit Neural Networks (SNNs), a new type of binary
quantization design tailored to compress and accelerate BNNs. SNNs are inspired
by an empirical observation, showing that binary kernels learnt at
convolutional layers of a BNN model are likely to be distributed over kernel
subsets. As a result, unlike existing methods that binarize weights one by one,
SNNs are trained with a kernel-aware optimization framework, which exploits
binary quantization in the fine-grained convolutional kernel space.
Specifically, our method includes a random sampling step generating
layer-specific subsets of the kernel space, and a refinement step learning to
adjust these subsets of binary kernels via optimization. Experiments on visual
recognition benchmarks and the hardware deployment on FPGA validate the great
potentials of SNNs. For instance, on ImageNet, SNNs of ResNet-18/ResNet-34 with
0.56-bit weights achieve 3.13/3.33 times runtime speed-up and 1.8 times
compression over conventional BNNs with moderate drops in recognition accuracy.
Promising results are also obtained when applying SNNs to binarize both weights
and activations. Our code is available at https://github.com/yikaiw/SNN.

Previous theory in the literature is advanced by the effects of the terrestrial
inhomogeneous magnetic field embedded in weakly ionized ionospheric layers
ranging in altitude from about $50$ to $500$ km. It is shown that the
ionospheric conducting fluids can support the formation of solitary dipolar
vortices (or modons). Both analytical and numerical solutions of the latter are
obtained and analyzed. It is found that in absence of the Pedersen
conductivity, different vortex structures with different space localization can
be formed which can move with the supersonic velocity without any energy loss.
However, its presence can cause the amplitude of the solitary vortices to decay
with time and the vortex structure can completely disappear owing to the energy
loss. Such energy loss can be delayed, i.e., the vortex structure can prevail
for relatively a longer time if the nonlinear effects associated with either
the stream function or the density variation become significantly higher than
the dissipation due to the Pedersen conductivity. The main characteristic
dynamic parameters are also defined which are in good correlation with the

100,000 images. We used four different metrics for evaluation: classification
accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), the
TPR$_0$ score and the TPR$_{10}$ score. The performances of
self-attention-based encoder models and CNNs participating in the challenge are
compared. They were able to surpass the CNN models that participated in the
Bologna Lens Challenge by a high margin for the TPR$_0$ and TPR_${10}$.
Self-Attention based models have clear advantages compared to simpler CNNs.
They have highly competing performance in comparison to the currently used
residual neural networks. Compared to CNNs, self-attention based models can

potential candidates from real data. Moreover, introducing the encoder layers

examined, namely, plane strain and plane stress, both under pure mode I and
pure mode II loading conditions. The constitutive relations are based on
Taylor's dislocation model, which enables gaining insights into the role of the
increased dislocation density associated with large gradients in plastic strain
near cracks. The material model is implemented in a commercial finite element

intensity factors (SIF) are evaluated as a function of the intrinsic material
length, characterising the scale at which gradient effects become significant.
As a result of the FE calculations of dislocation density distributions, the
effects of both the fracture mode and the stress-strain state are determined.
In pure mode I, the geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density is
located symmetrically with respect to the blunted crack tip. On the contrary,
under pure mode II, the GND density becomes concentrated in the blunted and
sharp parts of the crack tip. In this case, fracture initiation is shown to be
likely to occur near the blunted region of the crack tip, where both the stress
triaxiality and the GND density are at their maximum. The relation between the
equilibrium state of dislocation densities and the intrinsic material length as

this paper, we propose a noise-resilient ensemble classification method, which
helps to improve accuracy and correct random errors. The approach is inspired
by Evidence Accumulation Clustering , adapted to classification ensembles. We
compared it to the naive voter model over four multi-class datasets. Our model
showed a greater resilience, allowing us to recover prediction under a very
high noise level. In addition as the method is based on the evidence
accumulation clustering, our method is highly flexible as it can combines
classifiers with different label definitions.

abilities make opportunities to design more accurate, stable, and comprehensive
methods for color image segmentation. This paper presents a new way for
unsupervised image segmentation by combining histogram thresholding methods
(Kapur's entropy and Otsu's method) and different multi-objective swarm
intelligence algorithms (MOPSO, MOGWO, MSSA, and MOALO) to thresholding 3D
histogram of a color image. More precisely, this method first combines the
objective function of traditional thresholding algorithms to design
comprehensive objective functions then uses multi-objective optimizers to find
the best thresholds during the optimization of designed objective functions.
Also, our method uses a vector objective function in 3D space that could
simultaneously handle the segmentation of entire image color channels with the
same thresholds. To optimize this vector objective function, we employ
multiobjective swarm optimizers that can optimize multiple objective functions
at the same time. Therefore, our method considers dependencies between channels
to find the thresholds that satisfy objective functions of color channels
(which we name as vector objective function) simultaneously. Segmenting entire
color channels with the same thresholds also benefits from the fact that our
proposed method needs fewer thresholds to segment the image than other
thresholding algorithms; thus, it requires less memory space to save
thresholds. It helps a lot when we want to segment many images to many regions.
The subjective and objective results show the superiority of this method to
traditional thresholding methods that separately threshold histograms of a
color image.

the data from a high-dimensional representation to a lower dimensional one by
constructing the SPOD latent space; in the second, we build the time-dependent

demonstrated on two different test cases, namely, a compressible jet flow, and
a geophysical problem known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation. An extensive

fundamental problem in communication networks. As a sequential decision-making
under uncertainty problem, it is promising to approach ONRA via Reinforcement
Learning (RL). But, RL solutions suffer from the sample complexity issue; i.e.,
a large number of interactions with the environment needed to find an efficient
policy. This is a barrier to utilize RL for ONRA as on one hand, it is not
practical to train the RL agent offline due to lack of information about future
requests, and on the other hand, online training in the real network leads to
significant performance loss because of the sub-optimal policy during the
prolonged learning time. This performance degradation is even higher in
non-stationary ONRA where the agent should continually adapt the policy with
the changes in service requests. To deal with this issue, we develop a general
resource allocation framework, named RADAR, using model-based RL for a class of
ONRA problems with the known immediate reward of each action. RADAR improves
sample efficiency via exploring the state space in the background and
exploiting the policy in the decision-time using synthetic samples by the model
of the environment, which is trained by real interactions. Applying RADAR on
the multi-domain service federation problem, to maximize profit via selecting
proper domains for service requests deployment, shows its continual learning
capability and up to 44% performance improvement w.r.t. the standard model-free

this paper, we summarize VCM methodology and philosophy based on existing
academia and industrial efforts. The development of VCM follows a general
rate-distortion optimization, and the categorization of key modules or
techniques is established. From previous works, it is demonstrated that,
although existing works attempt to reveal the nature of scalable representation
in bits when dealing with machine and human vision tasks, there remains a rare
study in the generality of low bit rate representation, and accordingly how to
support a variety of visual analytic tasks. Therefore, we investigate a novel
visual information compression for the analytics taxonomy problem to strengthen
the capability of compact visual representations extracted from multiple tasks
for visual analytics. A new perspective of task relationships versus
compression is revisited. By keeping in mind the transferability among
different machine vision tasks (e.g. high-level semantic and mid-level
geometry-related), we aim to support multiple tasks jointly at low bit rates.
In particular, to narrow the dimensionality gap between neural network
generated features extracted from pixels and a variety of machine vision
features/labels (e.g. scene class, segmentation labels), a codebook hyperprior
is designed to compress the neural network-generated features. As demonstrated
in our experiments, this new hyperprior model is expected to improve feature
compression efficiency by estimating the signal entropy more accurately, which

unconventional spin Hall effect can be induced by controllable breaking the

learning based models for critical safety systems. Common approaches for OOD
detection assume access to some OOD samples during training which may not be
available in a real-life scenario. Instead, we utilize the {\em predictive
normalized maximum likelihood} (pNML) learner, in which no assumptions are made
on the tested input. We derive an explicit expression of the pNML and its
generalization error, denoted as the {\em regret}, for a single layer neural
network (NN). We show that this learner generalizes well when (i) the test
vector resides in a subspace spanned by the eigenvectors associated with the
large eigenvalues of the empirical correlation matrix of the training data, or
(ii) the test sample is far from the decision boundary. Furthermore, we
describe how to efficiently apply the derived pNML regret to any pretrained
deep NN, by employing the explicit pNML for the last layer, followed by the
softmax function. Applying the derived regret to deep NN requires neither
additional tunable parameters nor extra data. We extensively evaluate our
approach on 74 OOD detection benchmarks using DenseNet-100, ResNet-34, and
WideResNet-40 models trained with CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet-30

neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs often need big amounts of data and
annotations for training, both of which can be difficult and costly to obtain.
In this work, we propose a unified framework for generalized low-shot (one- and
few-shot) medical image segmentation based on distance metric learning (DML).
Unlike most existing methods which only deal with the lack of annotations while
assuming abundance of data, our framework works with extreme scarcity of both,
which is ideal for rare diseases. Via DML, the framework learns a multimodal
mixture representation for each category, and performs dense predictions based
on cosine distances between the pixels' deep embeddings and the category
representations. The multimodal representations effectively utilize the
inter-subject similarities and intraclass variations to overcome overfitting
due to extremely limited data. In addition, we propose adaptive mixing
coefficients for the multimodal mixture distributions to adaptively emphasize
the modes better suited to the current input. The representations are
implicitly embedded as weights of the fc layer, such that the cosine distances
can be computed efficiently via forward propagation. In our experiments on
brain MRI and abdominal CT datasets, the proposed framework achieves superior
performances for low-shot segmentation towards standard DNN-based (3D U-Net)
and classical registration-based (ANTs) methods, e.g., achieving mean Dice
coefficients of 81%/69% for brain tissue/abdominal multiorgan segmentation
using a single training sample, as compared to 52%/31% and 72%/35% by the U-Net
and ANTs, respectively.

certain elements in each of these Weyl group conjugacy classes to construct
strictly transverse slices to the conjugacy classes in these strata,
generalising the classical Steinberg slice, and similar cross sections were
built out of different Weyl group elements by He-Lusztig.
  In this paper we observe that He-Lusztig's and Sevostyanov's Weyl group
elements share a certain geometric property, which we call minimally dominant;
for example, we show that this property characterises involutions of maximal
length. Generalising He-Nie's work on twisted conjugacy classes in finite
Coxeter groups, we explain for various geometrically defined subsets that their
elements are conjugate by simple shifts, cyclic shifts and strong conjugations.
We furthermore derive for a large class of elements that the principal
Deligne-Garside factors of their powers in the braid monoid are maximal in some
sense. This includes those that are used in He-Lusztig's and Sevostyanov's
cross sections, and explains their appearance there; in particular, all
minimally dominant elements in the aforementioned conjugacy classes yield
strictly transverse slices. These elements are conjugate by cyclic shifts,
their Artin-Tits braids are never pseudo-Anosov in the conjectural

balance scores instead of covariates to reduce the dimension of the distance
metric and thus to achieve a faster convergence rate. DSM mass-imputation and
population inference are consistent if one of two balance score models is
correctly specified. Simulation results show that the DSM performs better than
recently developed double robust estimators when the data generating process
has nonlinear confounders. The nonlinearity of the DGP is a major concern
because it cannot be tested, and it leads to a violation of the assumptions
required to achieve consistency. Even if the consistency of the DSM relies on
the two modeling assumptions, it prevents bias from inflating under such cases
because DSM is a semiparametric estimator. The confidence intervals are
constructed using a wild bootstrapping approach. The proposed bootstrapping
method generates valid confidence intervals as long as DSM is consistent.

  from Formal Requirements","Submitted to AeroConf 2022",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Verification of complex, safety-critical systems is a significant challenge.
Manual testing and simulations are often used, but are only capable of
exploring a subset of the system's reachable states. Formal methods are
mathematically-based techniques for the specification and development of
software, which can provide proofs of properties and exhaustive checks over a
system's state space. In this paper, we present a formal requirements-driven
methodology, applied to a model of an aircraft engine controller that has been
provided by our industrial partner. Our methodology begins by formalising the
controller's natural-language requirements using the (pre-existing) Formal
Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET), iteratively, in consultation with our
industry partner. Once formalised, FRET can automatically translate the
requirements to enable their verification alongside a Simulink model of the
aircraft engine controller; the requirements can also guide formal verification
using other approaches. These two parallel streams in our methodology seek to
combine the results from formal requirements elicitation, classical
verification approaches, and runtime verification; to support the verification
of aerospace systems modelled in Simulink, from the requirements phase through
to execution. Our methodology harnesses the power of formal methods in a way
that complements existing verification techniques, and supports the
traceability of requirements throughout the verification process. This
methodology streamlines the process of developing verifiable aircraft engine
controllers, by ensuring that the requirements are formalised up-front and
useable during development. In this paper we give an overview of (FRET),
describe our methodology and work to-date on the formalisation and verification
of the requirements, and outline future work using our methodology.

weights for each feature source. Based on SCE module, a narrow network is
designed for final weld information recognition. To enhance the practicability
of our framework, we carefully design the architecture of framework with a few

we study RIS-enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)

on frequency-flat channels. Firstly, we introduce the delay adjustable
metasurface (DAM) relying on varactor diodes. In contrast to existing
reflecting elements, each one in DAM is capable of storing and retrieving the
impinging electromagnetic waves upon dynamically controlling its
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) properties, thus additionally
imposing an extra delay onto the reflected incident signals. Secondly, we
formulate the rate-maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit
power allocation and the RIS reflection coefficients as well as the RIS delays.
Furthermore, to address the coupling among optimization variables, we propose
an efficient algorithm to achieve a high-quality solution for the formulated
non-convex design problem by alternately optimizing the transmit power
allocation and the RIS reflection pattern, including the reflection
coefficients and the delays. Thirdly, to circumvent the high complexity for
optimizing the RIS reflection coefficients, we conceive a low-complexity scheme
upon aligning the strongest taps of all reflected channels, while ensuring that
the maximum delay spread after introducing extra RIS delays does not exceed the
length of the cyclic prefix (CP). Finally, simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed design significantly improves the OFDM rate performance as well as
the RIS's adaptability to wideband signals compared to baseline schemes without

complexity, prohibiting the real-time inference on resource-constrained
edge-computing platforms.
  To tackle this challenge, we propose Energon, an algorithm-architecture
co-design approach that accelerates various transformers using dynamic sparse
attention. With the observation that attention results only depend on a few
important query-key pairs, we propose a Mix-Precision Multi-Round Filtering
(MP-MRF) algorithm to dynamically identify such pairs at runtime. We adopt low
bitwidth in each filtering round and only use high-precision tensors in the
attention stage to reduce overall complexity. By this means, we significantly
mitigate the computational cost with negligible accuracy loss. To enable such
an algorithm with lower latency and better energy efficiency, we also propose
an Energon co-processor architecture. Elaborated pipelines and specialized
optimizations jointly boost the performance and reduce power consumption.
Extensive experiments on both NLP and CV benchmarks demonstrate that Energon

recently developed by the author, to capture the algebraic counterparts of
Jacobi manifolds as dimensioned Poisson algebras. Particularly, we give a
generalisation of the functor $\text{C}^\infty:\textsf{Smooth}\to
\textsf{Ring}$ for line bundles and Jacobi manifolds, we show that coisotropic
reduction of Jacobi manifolds provides an example of algebraic reduction of
dimensioned Poisson algebras and we discuss the relation between products of
Jacobi manifolds and the tensor products of their associated dimensioned
Poisson algebras. These results motivate the definition of the category of
poly-line bundles, defined as collections of line bundles over the same base
manifold, and the corresponding generalisation of Jacobi structures into this
context, the so-called poly-Jacobi manifolds. We present some preliminary
results about these generalisations and discuss potential future lines of
research. An interesting outcome of this research is a somewhat surprising

  Massive-Scale Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With a growing demand for quasi-instantaneous communication services such as
real-time video streaming, cloud gaming, and industry 4.0 applications,
multi-constraint Traffic Engineering (TE) becomes increasingly important. While
legacy TE management planes have proven laborious to deploy, Segment Routing
(SR) drastically eases the deployment of TE paths and is thus increasingly
adopted by Internet Service Providers (ISP). There is a clear need in computing
and deploying Delay-Constrained Least-Cost paths (DCLC) with SR for real-time
interactive services. However, most current DCLC solutions are not tailored for
SR. They also often lack efficiency or guarantees. Similarly to approximation
schemes, we argue that the challenge is to design an algorithm providing both
performances and guarantees. However, conversely to most of these schemes, we
also consider operational constraints to provide a practical, high-performance
implementation.
  We leverage the inherent limitations of delay measurements and account for
the operational constraint added by SR to design a new algorithm, best2cop,
providing guarantees and performance in all cases. Best2cop outperforms a
state-of-the-art algorithm on both random and real networks of up to 1000
nodes. Relying on commodity hardware with a single thread, our algorithm
retrieves all non-superfluous 3-dimensional routes in only 250ms and 100ms
respectively. This execution time is further reduced using multiple threads, as
the design of best2cop enables a speedup almost linear in the number of cores.
Finally, we extend best2cop to deal with massive scale ISP by leveraging the
multi-area partitioning of these deployments. Thanks to our new topology
generator specifically designed to model the realistic patterns of such massive
IP networks, we show that best2cop solves DCLC-SR in approximately 1 second
even for ISP having more than 100000 routers.

$\mathbb{R}^d$ can be partitioned into $r$ subsets whose convex hulls have
non-empty $r$-fold intersection. Moreover, generic collections of fewer points
cannot be so divided. Extending earlier work of the first author, we show that
one can nonetheless guarantee inscribed ``polytopal partitions"" with specified
symmetry conditions in many such circumstances. Namely, for any faithful and
full--dimensional orthogonal representation $\rho\colon G\rightarrow O(d)$ of
any order $r$ group $G$, we show that a generic set of $t(r,d)-d$ points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ can be partitioned into $r$ subsets so that there are $r$
points, one from each of the resulting convex hulls, which are the vertices of
a convex $d$--polytope whose isometry group contains $G$ via the regular action
afforded by the representation. As with Tverberg's theorem, the number of
points is optimal for this. At one extreme, this gives polytopal partitions for
all regular $r$--gons in the plane, as well as for three of the six regular
4--polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^4$. At the other extreme, one has polytopal
partitions for $d$-polytopes on $r$ vertices with isometry group equal to $G$
whenever $G$ is the isometry group of a vertex--transitive $d$-polytope.

during processing. This can cause significant variation in the properties and

elusive due to the stochastic nature of this phenomenon. However, recent
advances in deep learning provide a promising alternative to traditional
experimental and physics-based methods for understanding this phenomenon.
Neural message passing allows deep learning to be applied to irregular inputs
including graph representations of grain structures in a material. In this
study we generate a large database of Monte Carlo simulations of abnormal grain
growth in an idealized system. We apply message passing neural networks to
predict the occurrence of abnormal grain growth in these simulations using only
the initial state of the system as input. A computer vision model is also
trained for the same task for comparison. The preliminary results indicate that
the message passing approach outperforms the computer vision method and
achieved 75% prediction accuracy, significantly better than random guessing.
Analysis of the uncertainty in the Monte Carlo simulations provides a road map

the GSEMO. We theoretically prove that the GSEMO can achieve the
(asymptotically) optimal theoretical guarantees under both static and dynamic
environments. For cardinality constraints, the GSEMO can achieve the optimal
polynomial-time approximation ratio, $1/2$. For more general matroid
constraints, the GSEMO can achieve an asymptotically optimal polynomial-time
approximation ratio, $1/2-\epsilon/(4n)$, where $\epsilon>0$ and $n$ is the
size of the ground set of items. Furthermore, when the objective function
(i.e., a linear combination of quality and diversity) changes dynamically, the
GSEMO can maintain this approximation ratio in polynomial running time,
addressing the open question proposed by Borodin. This also theoretically shows
the superiority of EAs over local search for solving dynamic optimization
problems for the first time, and discloses the robustness of the mutation
operator of EAs against dynamic changes. Experiments on the applications of

short delay time, we show how feedback can be used to filter out the central
peak of the Mollow triplet or switch the output between bunched and
anti-bunched photons by proper choice of round trip phase. We further show how
the loop length and round trip phase effects the zero-time second order quantum
correlation function, an indicator of bunching or anti-bunching. New resonances
introduced through the feedback loop are also shown through their appearance in
the incoherent output spectrum from the waveguide. We explain these results in

of the JADE code, which uses realistic XUV-fluxes provided by our rotating

($a=0.01598 \rm AU$) at the protoplanetary disc dispersal, with mass $40.8~
M_{\oplus}$, and considering a broad range of host star initial surface
rotation rates ($\Omega_{\rm in}$) in the range $ [3.2, 18]~ \Omega_{\odot}$,
we find that only for $\Omega_{\rm in} \leq 5 \Omega_{\odot}$ do we reproduce
the current position of the planet, given that for $\Omega_{\rm in}$ larger
than $5 \Omega_{\odot}$ its orbit is efficiently deflected by dynamical tides.
We tested the impact of increasing the initial mass of the planet on the
efficiency of tides, finding that a higher initial mass ($1~M_{\rm Jup}$) does
not change the results reported above. Based on these results we computed the
evolution of the planetary atmospheres with the JADE code for a large range of

every vertex $v$ has the same set $X_v=X$ of forbidden degrees. We show the
following lower bound for every fixed set $X$: if there is an $\epsilon>0$ such

widespread in many aspects of our daily lives, including education, healthcare,

and robots collaborate in human environments, where social interaction is
unavoidable. Along with verbal communication, successful social interaction is
closely coupled with the interplay between nonverbal perception and action
mechanisms, such as observation of gaze behaviour and following their
attention, coordinating the form and function of hand gestures. Humans perform
nonverbal communication in an instinctive and adaptive manner, with no effort.
For robots to be successful in our social landscape, they should therefore
engage in social interactions in a humanlike way, with increasing levels of
autonomy. In particular, nonverbal gestures are expected to endow social robots
with the capability of emphasizing their speech, or showing their intentions.
Motivated by this, our research sheds a light on modeling human behaviors in
social interactions, specifically, forecasting human nonverbal social signals
during dyadic interactions, with an overarching goal of developing robotic
interfaces that can learn to imitate human dyadic interactions. Such an
approach will ensure the messages encoded in the robot gestures could be

modes. We find that the NDR occurs in a high dissipation regime, where the flow
resistivity is well above the theoretical value expected in the FF regime. We
understand our results on the basis of a rapid drop in vortex viscosity at high
drives in 2H-NbS$_2$, which triggers a rapid increase in the vortex velocity
and reorganization in the moving vortex matter leading to a dynamical unstable
vortex flow. This dynamical instability leads to the NDR transition into a high
entropy vortex state with high Ic.

long-standing goal in artificial intelligence research. With the recent success
of deep learning, incorporating reasoning with deep learning systems, i.e.,
neuro-symbolic AI has become a major field of interest. We propose the
Neuro-Symbolic Forward Reasoner (NSFR), a new approach for reasoning tasks
taking advantage of differentiable forward-chaining using first-order logic.
The key idea is to combine differentiable forward-chaining reasoning with
object-centric (deep) learning. Differentiable forward-chaining reasoning
computes logical entailments smoothly, i.e., it deduces new facts from given
facts and rules in a differentiable manner. The object-centric learning
approach factorizes raw inputs into representations in terms of objects. Thus,
it allows us to provide a consistent framework to perform the forward-chaining
inference from raw inputs. NSFR factorizes the raw inputs into the
object-centric representations, converts them into probabilistic ground atoms,
and finally performs differentiable forward-chaining inference using weighted
rules for inference. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations on
object-centric reasoning data sets, 2D Kandinsky patterns and 3D CLEVR-Hans,
and a variety of tasks show the effectiveness and advantage of our approach.

entity that operates around a given optical wavelength. Traditionally, the
channel capacity of a WDM system has been analyzed under different assumptions
for the transmitted signals of the other users, while treating the interference
arising from these users as noise. In this paper, we instead take a multiuser
information theoretic view and treat the optical WDM system impaired by
cross-phase modulation and dispersion as an interference channel. We
characterize an outer bound on the capacity region of simultaneously achievable
rate pairs, assuming a simplified K-user perturbative channel model using
genie-aided techniques. Furthermore, an achievable rate region is obtained by
time-sharing between certain single-user strategies. It is shown that such
time-sharing can achieve better rate tuples compared to treating nonlinear
interference as noise. For the single-polarization single-span system under
consideration and a power 4.4 dB above the optimum launch power, treating
nonlinear interference as noise results in a rate of 1.67 bit/sym, while

Array (ALMA), recent studies derived a relation between the disk surface
density and the location of the ""dust lines"". This is a new concept in the
field, linking the disk size at different continuum wavelengths with the radial
distribution of grain populations of different sizes. We aim to use a dust
evolution model to test the dependence of the dust line location on disk gas
mass. In particular, we are interested in the reliability of the method for
disks showing radial substructures, as recent high-resolution observations
revealed. Our models show that the determination of the dust line location is a
promising approach to the mass estimate of protoplanetay disks, but the exact
relation between the dust line location and disk mass depends on the structure
of the particular disk. We calibrated the relation for disks without evidence
of radial structures, while for more complex structures we ran a simple dust
evolution model. However, this method fails when there is evidence of strong
dust traps. It is possible to reveal when dust evolution is dominated by traps,
providing the necessary information for when the method should be applied with

self-attention over small non-overlapping image windows, for improving the
memory and computation efficiency. In addition, we introduce a convolution into
the FFN to exchange information across the disconnected image windows. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the High-Resolution Transformer on both human
pose estimation and semantic segmentation tasks, e.g., HRFormer outperforms
Swin transformer by $1.3$ AP on COCO pose estimation with $50\%$ fewer

the generalization capability, prior DG approaches have focused on extracting
domain-invariant information across sources to generalize on target domains,
while useful domain-specific information which strongly correlates with labels
in individual domains and the generalization to target domains is usually
ignored. In this paper, we propose meta-Domain Specific-Domain Invariant
(mDSDI) - a novel theoretically sound framework that extends beyond the

while jointly learning both domain-invariant and domain-specific features in a
unified framework. The domain-specific representation is optimized through the
meta-learning framework to adapt from source domains, targeting a robust
generalization on unseen domains. We empirically show that mDSDI provides
competitive results with state-of-the-art techniques in DG. A further ablation
study with our generated dataset, Background-Colored-MNIST, confirms the
hypothesis that domain-specific is essential, leading to better results when

additional higher-energy spectral components that require a separate emission

synchro-curvature (SC) and inverse Compton scattered (ICS) radiation from
accelerated particles (primaries) and synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) emission
from lower-energy pairs. Our models predict three distinct VHE components: SC
from primaries whose high-energy tail can extend to 100 GeV, SSC from pairs
that can extend to several TeV and ICS from primary particles accelerated in
the current sheet, scattering pair synchrotron radiation, that appears beyond
10 TeV. Our models suggest that H.E.S.S.-II and MAGIC have detected the

Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple
parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two
fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a
set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant
features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard
attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this
work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially:
(a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder
generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention
mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head
structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and
composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an
additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value
pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms
standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some
out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type
of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention,
allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be
implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.

model-independent determination of the $p_{\rm T}$-integrated yield per unit of

with the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) of prompt D mesons at

The analysis of the agreement between the measured $R_{\rm AA}$, elliptic

stability, and number of the Jovian circumpolar cyclones by establishing the
primary forces that act on them, which develop because of vorticity gradients
in the background of a cyclone. In the meridional direction, the background
vorticity varies owning to the planetary sphericity and the presence of the
polar cyclone. In the zonal direction, the vorticity varies by the presence of
adjacent cyclones in the ring. Our analysis successfully predicts the latitude

spin of the respective polar cyclone. Moreover, the analysis successfully
predicts that Jupiter can hold circumpolar cyclones while Saturn currently
cannot. The match between the theory and observations implies that vortices in
the polar regions of the giant planets are largely governed by barotropic
dynamics, and that the movement of other vortices at high-latitudes is also
driven by interaction with the background vorticity.

proved to effectively remove sensitive information from the latent

explicitly labeled protected variables (e.g. gender), which cannot be collected
in the context of recruiting in some countries (e.g. France). In this article,
we propose a new adversarial approach to remove sensitive information from the
latent representation of neural networks without the need to collect any

relevant private information from these layers. Comparing our approach to a
standard baseline on a public dataset with gender and ethnicity annotations, we
show that it effectively removes sensitive information from the main network.
Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of
adversarial techniques for obtaining a multimodal fair representation in the
context of video job interviews. In summary, our contributions aim at improving
fairness of the upcoming automatic systems processing videos of job interviews

network function. It is arguably acknowledged that the inferred causal
connectivity relies on causality measure one applies, and it may differ from
the network's underlying structural connectivity. However, the interpretation
of causal connectivity remains to be fully clarified, in particular, how causal
connectivity depends on causality measures and how causal connectivity relates
to structural connectivity. Here, we focus on nonlinear networks with pulse
signals as measured output, $e.g.$, neural networks with spike output, and
address the above issues based on four intensively utilized causality measures,
$i.e.$, time-delayed correlation, time-delayed mutual information, Granger
causality, and transfer entropy. We theoretically show how these causality
measures are related to one another when applied to pulse signals. Taking the
simulated Hodgkin-Huxley neural network and the real mouse brain network as two
illustrative examples, we further verify the quantitative relations among the
four causality measures and demonstrate that the causal connectivity inferred
by any of the four well coincides with the underlying network structural
connectivity, therefore establishing a direct link between the causal and
structural connectivity. We stress that the structural connectivity of networks
can be reconstructed pairwisely without conditioning on the global information
of all other nodes in a network, thus circumventing the curse of
dimensionality. Our framework provides a practical and effective approach for
pulse-output network reconstruction.

GNNs with sophisticated computational graph lead to higher latency and larger
memory consumption. Optimizing the GNN computational graph suffers from: (1)
Redundant neural operator computation. The same data are propagated through the
graph structure to perform the same neural operation multiple times in GNNs,
leading to redundant computation which accounts for 92.4% of total operators.
(2) Inconsistent thread mapping. Efficient thread mapping schemes for
vertex-centric and edge-centric operators are different. This inconsistency
prohibits operator fusion to reduce memory IO. (3) Excessive intermediate data.
For GNN training which is usually performed concurrently with inference,
intermediate data must be stored for the backward pass, consuming 91.9% of the
total memory requirement. To tackle these challenges, we propose following
designs to optimize the GNN computational graph from a novel coordinated
computation, IO, and memory perspective: (1) Propagation-postponed operator
reorganization. We reorganize operators to perform neural operations before the
propagation, thus the redundant computation is eliminated. (2) Unified thread
mapping for fusion. We propose a unified thread mapping scheme for both vertex-

data recomputation. Intermediate data are recomputed during the backward pass
to reduce the total memory consumption. Extensive experimental results on three
typical GNN models show that, we achieve up to 2.75x end-to-end speedup, 6.89x
less memory IO, and 7.73x less memory consumption over state-of-the-art

propose a new digital biomarker for cognitive abilities based on location
eigenbehaviour obtained from contactless ambient sensors. Indoor location
information obtained from passive infrared sensors is used to build a location
matrix covering several weeks of measurement. Based on the eigenvectors of this
matrix, the reconstruction error is calculated for various numbers of used
eigenvectors. The reconstruction error is used to predict cognitive ability
scores collected at baseline, using linear regression. Additionally,
classification of normal versus pathological cognition level is performed using
a support-vector-machine. Prediction performance is strong for high levels of
cognitive ability, but grows weaker for low levels of cognitive ability.
Classification into normal versus pathological cognitive ability level reaches
high accuracy with a AUC = 0.94. Due to the unobtrusive method of measurement
based on contactless ambient sensors, this digital biomarker of cognitive

digital biomarker for the binary classification and, to a lesser extent, for

cancelers are sought to make the FD systems realizable. Typically,
polynomial-based cancelers are employed to mitigate the SI; nevertheless, they
suffer from high complexity. This article proposes two novel hybrid-layers
neural network (NN) architectures to cancel the SI with low complexity. The
first architecture is referred to as hybrid-convolutional recurrent NN (HCRNN),
whereas the second is termed as hybrid-convolutional recurrent dense NN
(HCRDNN). In contrast to the state-of-the-art NNs that employ dense or
recurrent layers for SI modeling, the proposed NNs exploit, in a novel manner,
a combination of different hidden layers (e.g., convolutional, recurrent,

the polynomial and the state-of-the-art NN-based cancelers. The key idea behind
using hybrid layers is to build an NN model, which makes use of the
characteristics of the different layers employed in its architecture. More
specifically, in the HCRNN, a convolutional layer is employed to extract the
input data features using a reduced network scale. Moreover, a recurrent layer
is then applied to assist in learning the temporal behavior of the input signal
from the localized feature map of the convolutional layer. In the HCRDNN, an
additional dense layer is exploited to add another degree of freedom for
adapting the NN settings in order to achieve the best compromise between the
cancellation performance and computational complexity. Complexity analysis and
numerical simulations are provided to prove the superiority of the proposed
architectures.

effect in macroscopic driven diffusive systems. Upon modulation protocols, the
nontrivial geometric curvature in the parameter space universally induces an
additional pumped heat, beyond the constraint of hot-to-cold flowing.
Furthermore, we set up a minimum experiment and indeed observe a non-vanishing
directional heat flow across the driven system, despite keeping zero thermal
bias between two time-dependent thermal reservoirs at every instant. We verify
that in analogy to the geometric phase effect, the geometric pumped heat during
each driving cycle is independent of driving periods in the adiabatic limit and
coincides with theoretical predictions, thus validating its geometric origin.
These results about geometric heat pump effect could have potential

The main objective of this work is to study the loss of energy of the soliton

transmission of the soliton signal. In this context, a numerical scheme was
developed to solve a system of complex partial differential equations (CPDE)
that describes the propagation of solitons in optical fibers with loss and
nonlinear amplification mechanisms. The numerical procedure is based on the
mathematical theory of Taylor series of complex functions. We adapted the
Finite Difference Method (FDM) to approximate derivatives of complex functions.
Then, we solve the algebraic system resulting from the discretization,
implicitly, through the relaxation Gauss-Seidel method (RGSM). The numerical
study of CPDE system with linear and cubic attenuation showed that soliton
waves undergo attenuation, dispersion, and oscillation effects. On the other

emerged as a primary feature, playing an important role in users' shopping
journey. Watchlist items typically have multiple attributes whose values may
change over time (e.g., price, quantity). Since many users accumulate dozens of
items on their watchlist, and since shopping intents change over time,
recommending the top watchlist items in a given context can be valuable. In
this work, we study the watchlist functionality in e-commerce and introduce a
novel watchlist recommendation task. Our goal is to prioritize which watchlist
items the user should pay attention to next by predicting the next items the
user will click. We cast this task as a specialized sequential recommendation
task and discuss its characteristics. Our proposed recommendation model,
Trans2D, is built on top of the Transformer architecture, where we further
suggest a novel extended attention mechanism (Attention2D) that allows to learn
complex item-item, attribute-attribute and item-attribute patterns from
sequential-data with multiple item attributes. Using a large-scale watchlist
dataset from eBay, we evaluate our proposed model, where we demonstrate its
superiority compared to multiple state-of-the-art baselines, many of which are
adapted for this task.

including evaluation of environment simulation, evaluation on environments,
counterfactual policy evaluation, and evaluation on environments built from

Systems), a new resource with special concerns on the reality gaps, contains
two real-world datasets, data understanding tools, tuned simulation
environments, related advanced RL baselines, batch RL baselines, and
counterfactual policy evaluation algorithms. The RL4RS suite can be found at

dense flows is desired in a variety of research fields, both for laboratory and
industrial use. A new type of single-mode monofiber optical probe manufactured
by A2 Photonic Sensors is introduced in this paper: it combines traditional
phase detection with the collection of a Doppler signal returned by an incoming
gas-liquid interface to provide information on residence times, drop
concentration and velocity, which afford then drop chords and liquid flux
measurements. Compared with classical optical probes, that new sensor does not
require any calibration. The purpose of the present work is to test this
technique in assisted atomization in order to provide a mean for spray
characterization and ultimately to improve our understanding of atomization
mechanisms. The probe has been tested downstream of a coaxial air-assisted
atomizer operated at liquid velocity =. to. / , and gas velocity from = to
about /. We first analyzed raw signals in various flow conditions. It happens
that, when increasing the gas velocity and the number density of drops, the
signal experiences very strong fluctuations of the gas level, making the
identification of individual droplets more difficult. That leads us to develop
a new signal processing routine specifically adapted to such complex working
conditions. At = / and for three liquid flow rates, the spatial integration of
local liquid fluxes represents 92 to 99% of the injected liquid flow rate.
These good results demonstrate that the Doppler probe provides reliable
statistics on drops velocity and size.

This is due to their inclination to forget the knowledge acquired from

hand, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can model the input space utilizing
constrained k-means and thus maintain past knowledge. Here, we propose a novel
algorithm inspired by biological neurons, termed Dendritic-Self-Organizing Map

from specific regions of the input space accompanied by a set of hit matrices,
one per SOM, which estimate the association between units and labels. The
best-matching unit of an input pattern is selected using the maximum cosine
similarity rule, while the point-wise mutual information is employed for class
inference. DendSOM performs unsupervised feature extraction as it does not use
labels for targeted updating of the weights. It outperforms classical SOMs and
several state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms on benchmark datasets,

result with a lower error likeliness is accepted. We obtain a self-healing,
