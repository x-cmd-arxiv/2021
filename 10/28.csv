bar of length $L$ with a solid-solid interface. The process is assumed to be
developed along one direction, across two homogeneous and isotropic materials.
Analytical and numerical solutions are obtained under continuity conditions at
the interface, that is a perfect assembly. The lateral side is assumed to be
isolated and a constant thermal source is located at the left-boundary while
the right-end stays free allowing the heat to transfer to the surrounding fluid
by a convective process. The differences between the analytic solution and
temperature measurements at any point on the right would indicate the presence
of discontinuities. The greater these differences, the greater the
discontinuity in the interface due to thermal resistances, providing a measure
of its propagation from the interface and they could be modeled as temperature
perturbations. The problem of interest may be described by a parabolic equation
with initial, interface and boundary conditions, where the thermal properties,
the conductivity and diffusivity coefficients, are piecewise constant
functions. The analytic solution is derived by using Fourier methods. Special
attention is given to the Sturm-Liouville problem that arises when deriving the
solution, since a complicated eigenvalue equation must to be solved. Numerical
simulations are conducted by using finite difference schemes where its
convergence and stability properties are discussed along with physical
interpretations of the results.

service. We analyze a downlink communication serving two types of traffic:
enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication
(URLLC). Due to the nature of low-latency traffic, the base station knows the
channel state information (CSI) of the eMBB users while having statistical CSI
for the URLLC users. We study the power minimization problem employing
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
schemes. Based on this analysis, we propose a lookup table-based approach and a
block coordinated descent (BCD) algorithm. We show that the BCD is optimal for
the URLLC power allocation. The numerical results show that NOMA leads to lower
power consumption than OMA, except when the average channel gain of the URLLC
user is very high. For the latter case, the optimal approach depends on the
channel condition of the eMBB user. Even when OMA attains the best performance,
the gap with NOMA is negligible, showing the capability of NOMA to reduce power

high-dimensional data without supervision has achieved remarkable progress
recently. Although the ultimate goal of URLs is similar across various
scenarios, the related algorithms differ widely in different tasks because they
were separately designed according to a specific URL task or data. For example,
dimension reduction methods, t-SNE, and UMAP, optimize pair-wise data
relationships by preserving the global geometric structure, while
self-supervised learning, SimCLR, and BYOL, focus on mining the local
statistics of instances under specific augmentations. From a general
perspective, we summarize and propose a unified similarity-based URL framework,
GenURL, which can adapt to various URL tasks smoothly and efficiently. Based on
the manifold assumption, we regard URL tasks as different implicit constraints
on the data geometric structure or content that help to seek an optimal
low-dimensional representation for the high-dimensional data. Therefore, our
method has two key steps to learning task-agnostic representation in URL: (1)
data structural modeling and (2) low-dimensional transformation. Specifically,
(1) provides a simple yet effective graph-based submodule to model data
structures adaptively with predefined or constructed graphs; and based on
data-specific pretext tasks, (2) learns compact low-dimensional embeddings.
Moreover, (1) and (2) are successfully connected and benefit mutually through
our novel objective function. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
GenURL achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised
visual representation learning, unsupervised knowledge distillation, graph
embeddings, and dimension reduction.

in strong gravitational lensing analyses. However, the distribution of mass in
real galaxies is more complex. We quantify the biases due to this model
mismatch by simulating and then analysing mock {\it Hubble Space Telescope}
imaging of lenses with mass distributions inferred from SDSS-MaNGA stellar
dynamics data. We find accurate recovery of source galaxy morphology, except
for a slight tendency to infer sources to be more compact than their true size.
The Einstein radius of the lens is also robustly recovered with 0.1% accuracy,
as is the global density slope, with 2.5% relative systematic error, compared
to the 3.4% intrinsic dispersion. However, asymmetry in real lenses also leads
to a spurious fitted `external shear' with typical strength, $\gamma_{\rm
ext}=0.015$. Furthermore, time delays inferred from lens modelling without
measurements of stellar dynamics are typically underestimated by $\sim$5%.
Using such measurements from a sub-sample of 37 lenses would bias measurements
of the Hubble constant $H_0$ by $\sim$9%. Although this work is based on a
particular set of MaNGA galaxies, and the specific value of the detected biases
may change for another set of strong lenses, our results strongly suggest the
next generation cosmography needs to use more complex lens mass models.

This paper resolves this challenge for the model of episodic Markov games. We
design a new class of fully decentralized algorithms -- V-learning, which
provably learns Nash equilibria (in the two-player zero-sum setting),
correlated equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria (in the multiplayer
general-sum setting) in a number of samples that only scales with
$\max_{i\in[m]} A_i$, where $A_i$ is the number of actions for the $i^{\rm th}$
player. This is in sharp contrast to the size of the joint action space which
is $\prod_{i=1}^m A_i$. V-learning (in its basic form) is a new class of
single-agent RL algorithms that convert any adversarial bandit algorithm with
suitable regret guarantees into a RL algorithm. Similar to the classical
Q-learning algorithm, it performs incremental updates to the value functions.
Different from Q-learning, it only maintains the estimates of V-values instead
of Q-values. This key difference allows V-learning to achieve the claimed
guarantees in the MARL setting by simply letting all agents run V-learning
independently.

singularities and $f$ has relative dimension one, they compared these
invariants to the Donaldson-Thomas, or equivalently the Pandharipande-Thomas
invariants of $Y$.
  We define Bryan-Steinberg invariants for maps $f$ as above without assuming
that $Y$ is Calabi-Yau. For $X$ with Gorenstein and rational singularities, $f$
of relative dimension one, and for insertions from $X$ and arbitrary descendant
levels, we conjecture a relation between the generating functions of
Bryan-Steinberg and Pandharipande-Thomas invariants of $Y$. We check the
conjecture for the contraction $f: Y\to X$ of a rational curve $C$ with normal
bundle $N_{C/Y}\cong \mathcal{O}_C(-1)^{\oplus 2}$ using degeneration and
localization techniques to reduce to a Calabi-Yau situation, which we then
treat using Joyce's motivic Hall algebra.

accretion physics, star formation and IMBHs searches. As the sample size of
X-ray data from modern observatories increases, producing extensive catalogues
of ULXs and studying their collective properties is a possibility and a
priority.
  Aims. We build a ULX catalogue based on one of the latest XMM-Newton
releases, 4XMM-DR9, and the galaxy catalogue HECATE and study whether the
properties of the expanded XMM-Newton ULX population are consistent with
previous findings.
  Methods. We perform cross-matching between XMM-Newton sources and HECATE
objects to identify host galaxies, and flag known interlopers in external
catalogues and databases. Manual inspection of image data from PanSTARRS1 and
the NASA/IPAC database is occasionally performed. We use distance and
luminosity arguments to identify ULX candidates. Spectral, abundance and
variability properties of the candidates are studied from 4XMM-DR9, HECATE and
4XMM-DR9s parameters.
  Results. We identify 779 ULX candidates. In spiral galaxies the number of ULX
candidates per star forming rate is consistent with previous studies, and a
significant ULX population in elliptical and lenticular is also found.
Candidates hosted by late-type galaxies are more abundant, present harder
spectra and undergo more and more extreme inter-observation variability than
the early-type hosted ones. Around 30 candidates with $L_\textrm{X}>10^{41}$
erg s$^{-1}$ are also identified.
  Conclusions. Our results on the spectral and abundance properties of ULXs
confirm the findings made by previous studies based on XMM-Newton and Chandra
data, while our population-scale study on variability properties is
unprecedented. Our study provides limited insight on the properties of the
brightest ULX candidates due to the small sample size.

in gauge theory, with comparisons to classical mechanics. Given a physical
system composed of subsystems, such significance is to be awarded to physical
differences of the composite system that arise from symmetries acting solely on
its subsystems. So my overarching main question is: can DES be associated to
the local gauge symmetries, acting solely on subsystems? In local gauge
theories, any quantity with physical significance must be a gauge-invariant
quantity. To attack the question of DES from this gauge-invariant angle, we
require a split of the state into its physical and its representational
content: a split that is relative to a representational convention, or a
gauge-fixing. Using this method, we propose a rigorous definition of DES, valid
for any state. This definition fills the gaps in influential previous
construals of DES. In particular, Wallace's need to specialize to `generic'
states is explained and dispensed with.

large-scale tests of gravity using galaxy cluster observations. The pipeline,
which currently uses cluster number counts to constrain the present-day
background scalar field $f_{R0}$ of Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity, fully accounts
for the effects of the fifth force on cluster properties including the
dynamical mass, the halo concentration and the observable-mass scaling
relations. This is achieved using general models which have been calibrated
over a wide and continuous mass range ($10^{11}M_{\odot}\lesssim
M\lesssim10^{15}M_{\odot}$) using a large suite of cosmological simulations,
including the first to simultaneously incorporate both screened modified
gravity and full baryonic physics. We show, using mock cluster catalogues, that
an incomplete treatment of the observable-mass scaling relations in $f(R)$
gravity, which do not necessarily follow the usual power-law behaviour, can
lead to unbiased and imprecise constraints. It is therefore essential to fully
account for these effects in future cosmological tests of gravity that will
make use of vast cluster catalogues from ongoing and upcoming galaxy surveys.
Our constraint framework can be easily extended to other gravity models; to
demonstrate this, we have carried out a similar modelling of cluster properties
in the normal-branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model (nDGP), which features a
very different screening mechanism. Using our full-physics simulations, we also
study the angular power spectra of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effects in $f(R)$ gravity and nDGP, and demonstrate the potential for precise
constraints of gravity using data from upcoming CMB experiments. Finally, we
present a retuned baryonic physics model, based on the IllustrisTNG model,

Dreamer, learn the world model by reconstructing the image observations. Hence,
they often fail to discard task-irrelevant details and struggle to handle

contrastively learn the world model, but the performance tends to be inferior
in the absence of distractions. In this paper, we seek to enhance robustness to
distractions for MBRL agents. Specifically, we consider incorporating
prototypical representations, which have yielded more accurate and robust
results than contrastive approaches in computer vision. However, it remains
elusive how prototypical representations can benefit temporal dynamics learning
in MBRL, since they treat each image independently without capturing temporal
structures. To this end, we propose to learn the prototypes from the recurrent
states of the world model, thereby distilling temporal structures from past
observations and actions into the prototypes. The resulting model, DreamerPro,
successfully combines Dreamer with prototypes, making large performance gains
on the DeepMind Control suite both in the standard setting and when there are

appearance of second class constraints. We determine the full set of phase

molecular phases with melting temperatures varying non-monotonically by over
400 degrees with pressure, we predict a hexatic phase, which is an intermediate
between a solid and a liquid, and a superionic phase with a high electrical
conductivity exceeding that of battery materials. Notably, this suggests that
nanoconfinement could be a promising route towards superionic behavior at

predict the relationship between properties of the protocluster -- its mass and
the metallicity of the protocluster gas cloud -- and the final observable
properties today -- its current metallicity and the internal iron abundance
spread. We apply this model to an updated catalog of Milky Way globular
clusters where the initial mass and/or the iron abundance spread is known to
reconstruct their initial metallicities. We find that with the exception of the
known anomalous bulge cluster Terzan 5 and three clusters strongly suspected to
be nuclear star clusters from stripped dwarf galaxies, the model provides a
good lens for understanding their iron spreads and initial metallicities. We
then use these initial metallicities to construct age-metallicity relations for
kinematically-identified major accretion events in the Milky Way's history. We
find that using the initial metallicity instead of the current metallicity does
not alter the overall picture of the Milky Way's history, since the difference

the angular similarity to a target classifier into an instance-dependent and an

sensitive information about changes in the input while the instance-independent
component represents the insensitive information serving solely to minimize the
loss on the training dataset. Inspired by the decomposition, we analytically
derive a simple extension to current softmax-linear models, which learns to
disentangle the two components during training. On several common vision
models, the disentangled model outperforms other calibration methods on
standard calibration metrics in the face of out-of-distribution (OOD) data and

Fermilab to verify performance before the start of production. Its cavities
were processed with a novel nitrogen doping treatment to improve gradient
performance. The cryomodule was tested with a modified protocol to process
sporadic quenches, which were observed in LCLS-II production cryomodules and
are attributed to multipacting. Dedicated vertical test experiments support the
attribution to multipacting. The verification cryomodule achieved an
acceleration voltage of 200 MV in continuous wave mode, corresponding to an
average accelerating gradient of 24.1 MV/m, significantly exceeding the
specification of 173 MV. The average Q0 (3.0x10^10) also exceeded its
specification (2.7x10^10). After processing, no field emission was observed up
to the maximum gradient of each cavity. This paper reviews the cryomodule
performance and discusses operational issues and mitigations implemented during
the several month program.

predicts an approximate particle diameter close to the Mie model for particles

the Rayleigh effect on single-scattering properties, neither Hapke approximate

the near horizon regime resulting in a simplification of the analysis for the

physical properties. Moreover, we study the monotonicity of the coefficient
$\alpha$ of the entanglement's area term, the so called area theorem. We find
that the difference between the UV and IR of the $\alpha$-values, normalized
with the thermal entropy, converges at large $d$ to a constant value which is
obtained analytically. Therefore, the large $d$ limit may be used as tool for
the study and (in)validation of the renormalization group monotonicity

convergence to certain values as $d$ increases. The extrapolation of the large
$d$ limit to low and intermediate dimensions shows good quantitative agreement

find two distinct subsets with the same sum. In this paper we present an

significantly improving over the $O^*(3^{0.488n})$ running time of the best
known worst-case algorithm and the Meet-in-the-Middle benchmark of
$O^*(3^{0.5n})$.
  Our algorithm generalizes to a number of related problems, such as the
``Generalized Equal Subset Sum'' problem, which asks us to assign a coefficient
$c_i$ from a set $C$ to each input number $x_i$ such that $\sum_{i} c_i x_i =
0$. Our algorithm for the average-case version of this problem runs in~time
$|C|^{(0.5-c_0/|C|)n}$ for some positive constant $c_0$, whenever $C=\{0, \pm

  Our approach relies on new structural results that characterize the

$p_T$ broadening in the Langevin motion is smaller than that in the Glasma

to a faster momentum broadening due to memory, or equivalently to a strong

  harvesting","Seeking comments and suggested references to prior work",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Betz's law, purportedly, says an ideal wind harvester cannot extract more
than 16/27 ($\sim$59\%) of the wind energy. As the law's derivation relies on
momentum and energy conservation with incompressible flow and not the physical
mechanism coupling the wind-field to the extraction of work it is ubiquitously
regarded as a ""universal"" upper bound on efficiency, as inclusion of mechanics,
aerodynamics and thermodynamics are presumed to worsen this upper bound. Here
we show that when unneeded assumptions in the Betz's law derivation are relaxed
a higher bound of 2/3 ($\sim$67\%) can be achieved. A concrete example,
strictly obeying the identical energy and momentum conservation used to derive
the Betz's law, is given that violates Betz's law by achieving our higher 2/3
bound. Thus Betz's law is not a universal limit on wind energy harvesting
efficiency. More surprisingly, we show Betz law is not simply the limit case of
a vanishingly-thin turbine either. In 2-D models specific for turbines, radial
flow is known to occur to occur as a consequence of angular
momentum,\cite{Sharpe2004} but here we show in a 1-D modelthat allowing any
radial flux out of the harvester cross-section can increase the efficiency
without any need to consider angular momentum or explicit 2-D models. A key
design insight we glean is that for high-efficiency harvesters it is better to
strive for the least pressure build up (to increase flux) -- the exact opposite
of the Betz model's sole operational principle of high pressure differentials.
Additionally, we derive an alternative metric of harvester efficiency which
takes into account the downstream wake expansion ignored by the conventional
definition of power conversion factors, and the resulting upper bound this
places on power extraction from dense grids of harvesters.

intestines and tumours, relies on the coordinated migration of cells in 3D
curved environments. In these settings, cells establish supracellular patterns
of motion, including collective rotation and invasion. While such collective
modes are increasingly well understood in 2D flat systems, the consequences of
geometrical and topological constraints on collective cell migration in 3D
curved tissues are largely unknown. Here, we study 3D collective migration in
mammary cell spheroids, which represent a common and conceptually simple curved
geometry. We discover that these rotating spheroids exhibit a collective mode
of cell migration in the form of a velocity wave propagating along the equator
with a wavelength equal to the spheroid perimeter. This wave is accompanied by
a pattern of incompressible cellular flow across the spheroid surface featuring
topological defects, as dictated by the closed spherical topology. Using a
minimal active particle model, we reveal that this collective mode originates
from the active flocking behaviour of a cell layer confined to a curved
surface. Our results thus identify curvature-induced velocity waves as a
generic mode of collective cell migration, which could impact the dynamical
organization of 3D curved tissues.

small-scale spatio-temporal heterogeneities in, or viscoelastic properties of,

multi-state characteristics, i.e. distinct modes of transport dynamically
interconverting between each other in a stochastic manner. Reliably

reveal a strong correlation between brightness temperature contrasts and zonal
winds, confirming that the banded structure extends throughout the troposphere.
However, the microwave brightness gradient is observed to change sign with
depth: the belts are microwave-bright in the $p<5$ bar range and microwave-dark
in the $p>10$ bar range. The transition level (which we call the jovicline) is
evident in the MWR 11.5 cm channel, which samples the 5-14 bar range when using
the limb-darkening at all emission angles. The transition is located between 4
and 10 bars, and implies that belts change with depth from being
NH$_3$-depleted to NH$_3$-enriched, or from physically-warm to physically-cool,
or more likely a combination of both. The change in character occurs near the
statically stable layer associated with water condensation. The implications of
the transition are discussed in terms of ammonia redistribution via meridional
circulation cells with opposing flows above and below the water condensation
layer, and in terms of the `mushball' precipitation model, which predicts
steeper vertical ammonia gradients in the belts versus the zones. We show via
the moist thermal wind equation that both the temperature and ammonia
interpretations can lead to vertical shear on the zonal winds, but the shear is
$\sim50\times$ weaker if only NH$_3$ gradients are considered. Conversely, if
MWR observations are associated with kinetic temperature gradients then it
would produce zonal winds that increase in strength down to the jovicline,
consistent with Galileo probe measurements; then decay slowly at higher
pressures.

We consider a stochastic setting where all the orders are i.i.d. sampled from

such as the canonical (quantity-based) network revenue management problem and
the Adwords problem. While the literature on the topic mainly focuses on regret
minimization, our paper considers the \textit{fairness} aspect of the problem.
On a high level, we define the fairness in a way that a fair online algorithm
should treat similar agents/customers similarly, and the decision made for
similar agents/customers should be consistent over time. To achieve this goal,
we define the fair offline solution as the analytic center of the offline
optimal solution set, and introduce \textit{cumulative unfairness} as the
cumulative deviation from the online solutions to the fair offline solution
over time. We propose a fair algorithm based on an interior-point LP solver and
a mechanism that dynamically detects unfair resource spending. Our algorithm
achieves cumulative unfairness on the scale of order $O(\log(T))$, while
maintains the regret to be bounded without dependency on $T$. In addition,
compared to the literature, our result is produced under less restrictive

involving symmetric and/or antisymmetric combinations of the covariant
derivative of the vector field plus an arbitrary function of the vector field
times the Ricci scalar. Then, we study the degeneracy of the full theory to
determine whether it can be healthy or not. We find relations among some of the
free functions in the Lagrangian that are necessary for the healthiness of the

be turned degenerate. Finally, we take the decoupling limit of the theory and
find additional conditions on the free functions that are necessary for the

that strategic agents' intrinsic needs of learning benefit (instead of harming)

the size of the bandgap. Here we examine quantum oscillations of the

crucial role. In models of these systems, self-consistent parameters themselves
oscillate with changing magnetic field, generating additional contributions to
quantum oscillations. In the low-temperature, weak-field regime, we find that

stellar system and a low surface brightness dwarf spheroidal, are adjacent
systems in the direction of the Virgo cluster. Both have been studied in detail
previously, with it being suggested that they are unrelated normal dwarf
galaxies or that NGVS 3543 recently lost its gas through ram pressure
stripping, and that AGC 226178 formed from this stripped gas. However, with HST
ACS imaging we demonstrate that the stellar population of NGVS 3543 is
inconsistent with being at the distance of the Virgo cluster, and that it is
likely a foreground object at approximately 10 Mpc. Whereas the stellar
population of AGC 226178 is consistent with it being a very young (10-100 Myr)
object in the Virgo cluster. Through a re-analysis of the original ALFALFA HI
detection we show that AGC 226178 likely formed from gas stripped from the
nearby dwarf galaxy VCC 2034, a hypothesis strengthened by the high metallicity
measured with MUSE VLT observations. However, it is unclear whether ram
pressure or a tidal interaction is responsible for stripping the gas. AGC
226178 is one of at least five similar objects now known towards Virgo. These
objects are all young and unlikely to remain visible for over ~500 Myr,
suggesting that they are continually produced in the cluster.

star mergers (NSMs) and special classes of core-collapse supernovae (rCCSNe)
are leading candidates. Due to these channels' distinct characteristic
timescales (rCCSNe: prompt, NSMs: delayed), measuring $r$-process enrichment in
galaxies of similar mass, but differing star-formation durations might prove
informative. Two recently discovered disrupted dwarfs in the Milky Way's
stellar halo, Kraken and \textit{Gaia}-Sausage Enceladus (GSE), afford
precisely this opportunity: both have $M_{\star}\approx10^{8}M_{\rm{\odot}}$,
but differing star-formation durations of ${\approx}2$ Gyrs and ${\approx}3.6$
Gyrs. Here we present $R\approx50,000$ Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy for 31 stars
from these systems, detecting the $r$-process element Eu in all stars. Stars
from both systems have similar [Mg/H]$\approx-1$, but Kraken has a median
[Eu/Mg]$\approx-0.1$ while GSE has an elevated [Eu/Mg]$\approx0.2$. With simple
models we argue NSM enrichment must be delayed by $500-1000$ Myrs to produce
this difference. rCCSNe must also contribute, especially at early epochs,
otherwise stars formed during the delay period would be Eu-free. In this
picture, rCCSNe account for $\approx50\%$ of the Eu in Kraken, $\approx25\%$ in
GSE, and $\approx15\%$ in dwarfs with extended star-formation durations like
Sagittarius. The inferred delay time for NSM enrichment is $10-100\times$
longer than merger delay times from stellar population synthesis -- this is not
necessarily surprising because the enrichment delay includes time taken for NSM
ejecta to be incorporated into subsequent generations of stars. For example,
this may be due to natal kicks that result in $r$-enriched material deposited
far from star-forming gas, which then takes $\approx10^{8}-10^{9}$ years to
cool in these galaxies.

conclusions drawn from general relativity and quantum theory about the nature
of the radiation emitted by a black hole. According to Hawking's original
argument, the radiation is thermal and its entropy thus increases monotonically
as the black hole evaporates. Conversely, due to the reversibility of time
evolution according to quantum theory, the radiation entropy should start to
decrease after a certain time, as predicted by the Page curve. This decrease
has been confirmed by new calculations based on the replica trick, which also
exhibit its geometrical origin: spacetime wormholes that form between the
replicas. Here we analyse the discrepancy between these and Hawking's original
conclusions from a quantum information theory viewpoint, using in particular
the quantum de Finetti theorem. The theorem implies the existence of extra
information, $W$, which is neither part of the black hole nor the radiation,
but plays the role of a reference. The entropy obtained via the replica trick
can then be identified to be the entropy $S(R|W)$ of the radiation conditioned
on the reference $W$, whereas Hawking's original result corresponds to the
non-conditional entropy $S(R)$. The entropy $S(R|W)$, which mathematically is
an ensemble average, gains an operational meaning in an experiment with $N$
independently prepared black holes: For large $N$, it equals the normalised
entropy of their joint radiation, $S(R_1 \cdots R_N)/N$. The discrepancy
between this entropy and $S(R)$ implies that the black holes are correlated.
The replica wormholes may thus be interpreted as the geometrical representation
of this correlation. Our results also suggest a many-black-hole extension of
the widely used random unitary model, which we support with non-trivial checks.

resemble $3+1$ d ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ gauge theory coupled to fermionic charged

any symmetries, i.e. it possesses a gravitational anomaly. We substantiate
these claims by constructing an explicit exactly solvable $4+1$ d Walker-Wang

random variables. A distribution is compatible with a given causal structure if
it can be realized by a process respecting these dependencies. Deciding whether
a distribution is compatible with a structure is a practically and
fundamentally relevant, yet very difficult problem. Only recently has a general
class of algorithms been proposed: These so-called inflation techniques
associate to any causal structure a hierarchy of increasingly strict
compatibility tests, where each test can be formulated as a computationally
efficient convex optimization problem. Remarkably, it has been shown that in
the classical case, this hierarchy is complete in the sense that each
non-compatible distribution will be detected at some level of the hierarchy. An
inflation hierarchy has also been formulated for causal structures that allow
for the observed classical random variables to arise from measurements on
quantum states - however, no proof of completeness of this quantum inflation
hierarchy has been supplied. In this paper, we construct a first version of the
quantum inflation hierarchy that is provably convergent. From a technical point
of view, convergence proofs are built on de Finetti Theorems, which show that
certain symmetries (which can be imposed in convex optimization problems) imply
independence of random variables (which is not directly a convex constraint). A
main technical ingredient to our proof is a Quantum de Finetti Theorem that
holds for general tensor products of $C^*$-algebras, generalizing previous work
that was restricted to minimal tensor products.

mergers and should form frequently in galactic nuclei. Sub-parsec binaries can
be identified from their bright electromagnetic emission, e.g., Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) with Doppler shifted broad emission lines or AGN with periodic
variability, as well as from the emission of strong gravitational radiation.
The most massive binaries (with total mass >10^8 M_sol) emit in the nanohertz
band and are targeted by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Here we examine the
synergy between electromagnetic and gravitational wave signatures of SMBHBs. We
connect both signals to the orbital dynamics of the binary and examine the
common link between them, laying the foundation for joint multi-messenger
observations. We find that periodic variability arising from relativistic
Doppler boost is the most promising electromagnetic signature to connect with
GWs. We delineate the parameter space (binary total mass/chirp mass versus
binary period/GW frequency) for which joint observations are feasible.
Currently multi-messenger detections are possible only for the most massive and
nearby galaxies, limited by the sensitivity of PTAs. However, we demonstrate
that as PTAs collect more data in the upcoming years, the overlapping parameter

Wannier centers are obstructed from the atoms - even when they have identically
zero Berry curvature. Next, we derive general lower bounds for the superfluid
weight in terms of momentum space irreps in all 2D space groups, extending the
reach of topological quantum chemistry to superconducting states. We find that
the bounds can be naturally expressed using the formalism of real space
invariants (RSIs) that highlight the separation between electronic and atomic
degrees of freedom. Finally, using exact Monte Carlo simulations on a model
with perfectly flat bands and strictly local obstructed Wannier functions, we
find that an attractive Hubbard interaction results in superconductivity as
predicted by the RSI bound beyond mean-field. Hence, a nonzero superfluid
weight constitutes a nontrivial bulk property that distinguishes obstructed
bands from trivial bands in the presence of interactions.

both predict sizeable non-Gaussian primordial perturbations and anisotropic
$\mu$-type spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
blackbody. While CMB anisotropies allow us to probe non-Gaussianity at
wavenumbers $k\simeq 0.05\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, $\mu$-distortion anisotropies are
related to non-Gaussianity of primordial perturbation modes with much larger
wavenumbers, $k\simeq 740\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Through cross-correlations between
CMB and $\mu$-distortion anisotropies, one can therefore shed light on the
aforementioned inflation models. We investigate the ability of a future CMB
satellite imager like LiteBIRD to measure $\mu T$ and $\mu E$ cross-power
spectra between anisotropic $\mu$-distortions and CMB temperature and $E$-mode
polarization anisotropies in the presence of foregrounds, and derive LiteBIRD
forecasts on ${f_{\rm NL}^\mu(k\simeq 740\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}})}$. We show that $\mu
E$ cross-correlations with CMB polarization provide more constraining power on
$f_{\rm NL}^\mu$ than $\mu T$ cross-correlations in the presence of
foregrounds, and the joint combination of $\mu T$ and $\mu E$ observables adds
further leverage to the detection of small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity. We
find that LiteBIRD would detect ${f_{\rm NL}^\mu}=4500$ at $5\sigma$
significance after foreground removal, and achieve a minimum error of
${\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^\mu=0) \simeq 800}$ at 68\% CL by combining CMB temperature
and polarization. Due to the huge dynamic range of wavenumbers between CMB and
$\mu$-distortion anisotropies, such large $f^\mu_{\rm NL}$ values would still
be consistent with current CMB constraints in the case of very mild
scale-dependence of primordial non-Gaussianity. Anisotropic spectral
distortions thus provide a new path, complementary to CMB $B$-modes, to probe
inflation with LiteBIRD.

to be Page time, a quantity associated with the lifetime of the black hole. We
answer the first by evaluating an infinite number of `ladder of ladders'
Feynman diagrams to all orders in $M_{Pl}/M_{BH}$. Such processes can
generically be calculated in effective field theory in the black hole eikonal
phase where scattering energies satisfy $E M_{BH} \gg M^{2}_{Pl}$. Importantly,
interactions are mediated by a fluctuating metric; a fixed geometry is
insufficient to capture these effects. We find that the characteristic time
spent by the particles in the scattering region (the so-called Eisenbud-Wigner
time delay) is indeed Page time, confirming the long-standing expectation. This
implies that the entropy of radiation continues to increase, after the
particles are thrown in, until after Page time, when information begins to
re-emerge.

unstable dynamics can however be stabilised using, e.g., a modulation of the
rotation rates of the cylinders. Here we use Reinforcement Learning, a branch
of Machine Learning devoted to the optimal selection of actions based on
cumulative rewards, in order to devise a stabilisation algorithm for the
four-roll mill flow. The flow is modelled as the linear superposition of four
two-dimensional rotlets and the drop is treated as a rigid spherical particle
smaller than all other length scales in the problem. Unlike previous attempts
to devise control, we take a probabilistic approach whereby speed adjustments
are drawn from a probability density function whose shape is improved over time
via a form of gradient ascent know as Actor-Critic method. With enough
training, our algorithm is able to precisely control the drop and keep it close
to the stagnation point for as long as needed. We explore the impact of the
physical and learning parameters on the effectiveness of the control and
demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm against thermal noise. We finally

general signals by learning a continuous function that, parameterized as a

spatial coordinates of an image to its pixel values, for example. Being capable
of conveying fine details in a high dimensional signal, unboundedly of its

conventional discrete representations. However, the current approach is
difficult to scale for a large number of signals or a data set, since learning
a neural representation -- which is parameter heavy by itself -- for each
signal individually requires a lot of memory and computations. To address this
issue, we propose to leverage a meta-learning approach in combination with
network compression under a sparsity constraint, such that it renders a
well-initialized sparse parameterization that evolves quickly to represent a
set of unseen signals in the subsequent training. We empirically demonstrate
that meta-learned sparse neural representations achieve a much smaller loss
than dense meta-learned models with the same number of parameters, when trained
to fit each signal using the same number of optimization steps.

secular evolution. We find that, although secular evolution plays a role in
compact object (BH and NS) mergers, (70--85) \% (depending on the model
assumptions) of the mergers are solely due to common envelope (CE) evolution.
Significant eccentricities in the LIGO band (higher than 0.01) are only
obtained with zero supernova (SNe) kicks and are directly linked to the role of
secular evolution. A similar outlier effect is seen in the
$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distribution, with negative values obtained only with
zero SNe kicks. When kicks are taken into account, there are no systems that
evolve into a quadruple consisting of four compact objects. For our fiducial
model, we estimate the merger rates (in units of $\Gpcyr$) in 2+2 quadruples
(3+1 quadruples) to be 10.8 $\pm$ 0.9 (2.9 $\pm$ 0.5), 5.7 $\pm$ 0.6 (1.4 $\pm$
0.4) and 0.6 $\pm$ 0.2 (0.7 $\pm$ 0.3) for BH-BH, BH-NS and NS-NS mergers
respectively. The BH-BH merger rates represent a significant fraction of the
current LIGO rates, whereas the other merger rates fall short of LIGO
estimates.

for studying groups that act relatively geometrically on a CAT(0) cube complex,

that a group acting relatively geometrically on a CAT(0) cube complex admits a
generalized fine action on the one-skeleton of the cube complex. For
generalized fine actions, we prove a criterion for relative quasiconvexity as
subgroups that cocompactly stabilize quasi-convex sub-graphs, generalizing a

in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background using integrability, we revisit the
construction of type 0 string spectrum in some solvable examples of backgrounds
with RR fluxes that are common to type IIB and type 0B theories. The presence
of RR fluxes requires the use of a Green-Schwarz description for type 0 string
theory. Like in flat space, the spectrum of type 0 theory can be derived from
the type II theory spectrum by a $(-1)^F$ orbifolding, i.e. combining the
untwisted sector where GS fermions are periodic with the twisted sector where
GS fermions are antiperiodic (and projecting out all spacetime fermionic
states). This construction of the type 0 spectrum may also be implemented using
a Melvin background that allows to continuously interpolate between the type II
and type 0 theories. As an illustration, we discuss the type 0B spectrum in the
pp-wave background which is the Penrose limit of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ with RR
5-form flux and also in the pp-wave background which is the Penrose limit of
$AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ supported by mixed RR and NSNS 3-form fluxes. We
show that increasing the strength of the RR flux increases the value of the
effective normal ordering constant (which determines the mass of the type 0
tachyon) and thus effectively decreases the momentum-space domain of
instability of the ground state. We also comment on the semiclassical sector of
states of type 0B theory in $AdS_5 \times S^5$.

additionally check the calculation by evaluating the effective action on a

(QGEM) that aims to test the quantum nature of gravity using the entanglement
of 2 qubits was proposed. The entanglement can arise only if the force between
the two spatially superposed masses is occurring via the exchange of a
mediating virtual graviton. In this paper, we examine a possible improvement of
the QGEM setup by introducing a third mass with an embedded qubit, so that
there are now 3 qubits to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement.
We compare the entanglement generation for different experimental setups with 2
and 3 qubits and find that a 3-qubit setup where the superpositions are
parallel to each other leads to the highest rate of entanglement generation
within $\tau = 5 $ s. We will show that the 3-qubit setup is more resilient to
the higher rate of decoherence. The entanglement can be detected experimentally
for the 2-qubit setup if the decoherence rate $\gamma$ is $\gamma < 0.11 $ Hz
compared to $\gamma < 0.16 $ Hz for the 3-qubit setup. However, the
introduction of an extra qubit means that more measurements are required to
characterize entanglement in an experiment. We conduct experimental simulations
and estimate that the 3-qubit setup would allow detecting the entanglement in
the QGEM protocol at a $99.9\%$ certainty with $O(10^4)-O(10^5)$ measurements
when $\gamma \in [0.1,0.15] $ Hz. Furthermore, we find that the number of
needed measurements can be reduced to $O(10^3)-O(10^5)$ if the measurement
schedule is optimised using joint Pauli basis measurements. For $\gamma > 0.06
$ Hz the 3-qubit setup is favourable compared to the 2-qubit setup in terms of
the minimum number of measurements needed to characterize the entanglement.
Thus, the proposed setup here provides a promising new avenue for implementing
the QGEM experiment.

magnetic field lines are strongly suppressed. This anisotropic heat conduction,
in the presence of a large-scale temperature gradient, destabilizes the
outskirts of galaxy clusters via the magneto-thermal instability (MTI), and
thus supplies a source of observed ICM turbulence. In this paper we continue
our investigation of the MTI with 3D simulations using the Boussinesq code
SNOOPY. We redress two issues intrinsic to our previous 2D study: an inverse
energy cascade and the impossibility of dynamo action. Contrary to 2D
simulations, we find inconsequential transport of energy across scales (most
energy is dissipated at the same scale as its injection), and that turbulent
eddies are vertically elongated at or below the thermal conduction length, but
relatively isotropic on larger scales. Similar to 2D, however, the saturated
turbulent energy levels and the integral scale follow clear power-laws that
depend on the thermal diffusivity, temperature gradient, and buoyancy
frequency. We also show that the MTI amplifies magnetic fields, through a
fluctuation dynamo, to equipartition strengths provided that the integral scale
of MTI turbulence is larger than the viscous dissipation scale. Finally, we
show that our scaling laws are consistent with extant observations of ICM
turbulence if the thermal conductivity is reduced by a factor of $\sim 10$ from
its Spitzer value, and that on global cluster scales the stable stratification
significantly reduces the vertical elongation of MTI motions.

emerging as an alternative to the development of enterprise applications based
on the REST architectural style. However, little is known about the effects of
event-driven architecture on modularity while enterprise applications evolve.
Consequently, practitioners end up adopting it without any empirical evidence
about its impacts on essential indicators, including separation of concerns,
coupling, cohesion, complexity and size. This article, therefore, reports an
exploratory study comparing event-driven architecture and REST style in terms
of modularity. A real-world application was developed using an event-driven
architecture and REST through five evolution scenarios. In each scenario, a
feature was added. The generated versions were compared using ten metrics. The
initial results suggest that the event-driven architecture improved the
separation of concerns, but was outperformed considering the metrics of
coupling, cohesion, complexity and size. The findings are encouraging and can
be seen as a first step in a more ambitious agenda to empirically evaluate the
benefits of event-driven architecture against the REST style.

  Tracking of Autonomous Vehicles",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous driving has attracted lots of attention in recent years. An
accurate vehicle dynamics is important for autonomous driving techniques, e.g.
trajectory prediction, motion planning, and control of trajectory tracking.
Although previous works have made some results, the strong nonlinearity,
precision, and interpretability of dynamics for autonomous vehicles are open
problems worth being studied. In this paper, the approach based on the Koopman
operator named deep direct Koopman (DDK) is proposed to identify the model of
the autonomous vehicle and the identified model is a linear time-invariant
(LTI) version, which is convenient for motion planning and controller design.
In the approach, the Koopman eigenvalues and system matrix are considered as
trainable tensors with the original states of the autonomous vehicle being
concatenated to a part of the Koopman eigenfunctions so that a physically
interpretable subsystem can be extracted from the identified latent dynamics.
Subsequently, the process of the identification model is trained under the
proposed method based on the dataset which consists of about 60km of data
collected with a real electric SUV while the effectiveness of the identified
model is validated. Meanwhile, a high-fidelity vehicle dynamics is identified
in CarSim with DDK, and then, a linear model predictive control (MPC) called
DDK-MPC integrating DDK is designed to validate the performance for the control
of trajectory tracking. Simulation results illustrate that the model of the
nonlinear vehicle dynamics can be identified effectively via the proposed
method and that excellent tracking performance can be obtained with the
identified model under DDK-MPC.

pattern (SP) and the parameters of variational networks (VN) in accelerated
parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: The approach alternates
between improving the SP, using bias-accelerated subset selection, and
improving parameters of the VN, using ADAM with monotonicity verification. The
algorithm learns an effective pair: an SP that captures fewer k-space samples
generating undersampling artifacts that are removed by the VN reconstruction.
The proposed approach was tested for stability and convergence, considering
different initial SPs. The quality of the VNs and SPs was compared against
other approaches, including joint learning methods and VN learning with fixed
variable density Poisson-disc SPs, using two different datasets and different
acceleration factors (AF). Results: The root mean squared error (RMSE)
improvements ranged from 14.9% to 51.2% considering AF from 2 to 20 in the
tested brain and knee joint datasets when compared to the other approaches. The
proposed approach has shown stable convergence, obtaining similar SPs with the
same RMSE under different initial conditions. Conclusion: The proposed approach
was stable and learned effective SPs with the corresponding VN parameters that
produce images with better quality than other approaches, improving accelerated
parallel MRI applications.

periodically driven matter. Protecting its emergent spatiotemporal order
necessitates a mechanism that hinders the spreading of defects, such as
localization of domain walls in disordered quantum spin chains. In this work,
we establish the effectiveness of a different mechanism arising in clean spin
chains: the confinement of domain walls into ``mesonic'' bound states. We
consider translationally invariant quantum Ising chains periodically kicked at
arbitrary frequency, and discuss two possible routes to domain-wall
confinement: longitudinal fields and interactions beyond nearest neighbors. We
study the impact of confinement on the order parameter evolution by
constructing domain-wall-conserving effective Hamiltonians and analyzing the
resulting dynamics of domain walls. On the one hand, we show that for arbitrary
driving frequency the symmetry-breaking-induced confining potential gets
effectively averaged out by the drive, leading to deconfined dynamics. On the
other hand, we rigorously prove that increasing the range $R$ of spin-spin
interactions $J_{i,j}$ beyond nearest neighbors enhances the order-parameter
lifetime \textit{exponentially} in $R$. Our theory predictions are corroborated
by a combination of exact and matrix-product-state simulations for finite and
infinite chains, respectively. The long-lived stability of spatiotemporal order
identified in this work does not rely on Floquet prethermalization nor on
eigenstate order, but rather on the nonperturbative origin of vacuum-decay
processes. We point out the experimental relevance of this new mechanism for
stabilizing a long-lived time-crystalline response in Rydberg-dressed spin
chains.

decade, opening what could be an entire new spectroscopy of nuclear-physics
like complexity. Salient among these structures are the $Z_c$, much analyzed at
BESIII as nicely summarised by J.~Zhao at this conference. Their stature as new
hadron states has often been challenged by proposals that the peaks arise from
triangle singularities instead, because they appear in three-body reactions and
often satisfy the special kinematic conditions of the Coleman-Norton theorem.
To experimentally decide, we should like to resort to different reactions
erasing the kinematic coincidence, and see whether each peak survives. We
observe that the most universal ""eraser"" is the medium created in Heavy Ion
Collisions, because its high temperature often affects the masses and widths of
the particles participating in the reaction: if additionally the triangle
reaction is completed during the lifetime of the fireball, our computations in
thermal field theory show that the triangle singularities do not survive the
hot hadron phase (much less the hotter quark-gluon plasma). On the contrary,
ordinary quarkonia are affected but often survive the fireball and
molecular-like states are also routinely detected. We have provided several
examples, and here investigate the exotic $Z_{c}(4020)^\pm\to \pi^{\pm} h_c $
peak (produced against a $\pi^\mp$ in $e^+e^-$ collisions). If, as has been
proposed during the debates, it is produced or enhanced by a $D_{1} D^{*} D^*$
triangle loop, the estimate here reported suggests its disappearance near the
critical temperature of the confinement/deconfinement phase transition, so any
future detection in heavy-ion collision data would suggest it to be a real
hadron, with its absence leaning towards the singularity interpretation.

generative processes, where the cause of the missingness may not be fully
observed. This is known as missing not at random (MNAR) data. However, many
imputation methods do not take into account the missingness mechanism,
resulting in biased imputation values when MNAR data is present. Although there
are a few methods that have considered the MNAR scenario, their model's
identifiability under MNAR is generally not guaranteed. That is, model
parameters can not be uniquely determined even with infinite data samples,
hence the imputation results given by such models can still be biased. This
issue is especially overlooked by many modern deep generative models. In this
work, we fill in this gap by systematically analyzing the identifiability of
generative models under MNAR. Furthermore, we propose a practical deep
generative model which can provide identifiability guarantees under mild
assumptions, for a wide range of MNAR mechanisms. Our method demonstrates a
clear advantage for tasks on both synthetic data and multiple real-world

introduced in previous studies. Our analysis is restricted to ensembles of
identical oscillators with the global coupling. In such a setup, with an
additional assumption that the initial distribution of oscillators is uniform
on the sphere, one can derive equations for order parameters in closed form.
The rate of synchronization in a real Kuramoto model depends on the dimension
of the sphere. Specifically, synchronization is faster on higher-dimensional
spheres. On the other side, real order parameter in complex Kuramoto models
always satisfies the same ODE, regardless of the dimension. The derivation of
equations for real order parameters in Kuramoto models on spheres is based on
recently unveiled connections of these models with geometries of unit balls.
Simulations of the system with several hundreds of oscillators yield perfect
fits with the theoretical predictions, that are obtained by solving equations
for the order parameter.

employed to learn the filter banks of the multiple stages of a convolutional

This analysis requires computing distances among such diagrams such as the

bipartite graph on which a matching needs to be computed for determining these
PD distances. We address this problem by making several algorithmic and
computational observations in order to obtain an approximation. First, taking
advantage of the proximity of PD points, we condense them thereby decreasing
the number of nodes in the graph for computation. The increase in point
multiplicities is addressed by reducing the matching problem to a min-cost flow
problem on a transshipment network. Second, we use Well Separated Pair
Decomposition to sparsify the graph to a size that is linear in the number of
points. Both node and arc sparsifications contribute to the approximation
factor where we leverage a lower bound given by the Relaxed Word Mover's
distance. Third, we eliminate bottlenecks during the sparsification procedure
by introducing parallelism. Fourth, we develop an open source software called
PDoptFlow based on our algorithm, exploiting parallelism by GPU and multicore.
We perform extensive experiments and show that the actual empirical error is
very low. We also show that we can achieve high performance at low guaranteed

are increasingly interested in surveying large collections of networks that are
trained on, or biologically adapted to, similar tasks. A standardized set of
analysis tools is now needed to identify how network-level covariates -- such
as architecture, anatomical brain region, and model organism -- impact neural
representations (hidden layer activations). Here, we provide a rigorous
foundation for these analyses by defining a broad family of metric spaces that
quantify representational dissimilarity. Using this framework we modify
existing representational similarity measures based on canonical correlation
analysis to satisfy the triangle inequality, formulate a novel metric that
respects the inductive biases in convolutional layers, and identify approximate
Euclidean embeddings that enable network representations to be incorporated
into essentially any off-the-shelf machine learning method. We demonstrate
these methods on large-scale datasets from biology (Allen Institute Brain
Observatory) and deep learning (NAS-Bench-101). In doing so, we identify
relationships between neural representations that are interpretable in terms of
anatomical features and model performance.

pre-trained MutFormer on reference protein sequences and mutated protein
sequences resulting from common genetic variants observed in human populations.

MutFormer's performance on multiple testing data sets. We found that MutFormer
showed similar or improved performance over a variety of existing tools,

that MutFormer successfully considers sequence features that are not explored

three-leg interaction vertices $g\varphi^{3}$ and $gS\varphi^{2}$ ($\varphi$
and $S$ being scalar fields), which constitute the relativistic counterpart of
the Yukawa potential. We follow a non-perturbative unitarized one-loop resummed
technique for which the theory is unitary and well-defined for a large range of
values of the coupling constant $g$. Using the partial wave decomposition of
two-body scattering we calculate the phase shifts, whose derivatives are used
to infer the pressure of the system at nonzero temperature by using the
so-called phase shift formalism. A $\varphi \varphi$ bound state is formed when
the coupling $g$ is larger than a certain critical value. As the main outcomes
of this work, we estimate the influence of particle interaction on the pressure
(both without and with the bound state), and we demonstrate that the latter is
always continuous as a function of the coupling constant $g$ (no sudden jumps
occurs when the bound state forms), and we show that the contribution of the
bound state to the pressure does not count as \textit{one} state in the thermal
gas, since a cancellation with the residual $\varphi \varphi$ interaction
occurs. The amount of this cancellation depends on the details of the model and
its parameters and a variety of possible scenarios is presented. %Moreover,
even when no bound state occurs, we estimate the role of the interaction
(including a resonance in the $gS\varphi^{2}$ theory), which is in general
non-negligible. We also show how the overall effect of the interaction,
including eventual resonances and bound states, can be formally described by a
unique expression that makes use of the phase shift continued below the
threshold.

data analysis. However, its success usually hinges on efficiently training the
parameters in quantum neural networks, and the field of QML is still lacking
theoretical scaling results for their trainability. Some trainability results
have been proven for a closely related field called Variational Quantum

the gradient scaling of QML models. Our results indicate that features deemed
detrimental for VQA trainability can also lead to issues such as barren
plateaus in QML. Consequently, our work has implications for several QML
proposals in the literature. In addition, we provide theoretical and numerical
evidence that QML models exhibit further trainability issues not present in

fluctuations play a fundamental role in dissipation processes and in the
transport of energetic particles in space. Using PSP data, we present
measurements of geometry and anisotropy of the inner heliosphere magnetic
fluctuations, from fluid to kinetic scales. The results are surprising and
different from 1 au observations. We find that fluctuations evolve
characteristically with size scale. However, unlike 1 au solar wind, at the
outer scale, the fluctuations are dominated by wavevectors quasi-parallel to
the local magnetic field. In the inertial range, average wave vectors become
less field-aligned, but still remain more field aligned than near-Earth solar
wind. In the dissipation range, the wavevectors become almost perpendicular to
the local magnetic field in the dissipation range, to a much higher degree than
those indicated by 1 au observations. We propose that this reduced degree of
anisotropy in the outer scale and inertial range is due to the nature of
large-scale forcing outside the solar corona.

potentials, derived in the framework of braneworld scenarios, that generalizes
the well-known power law inflation. In this paper we update previous
constraints on the minimal coupled $\beta$-exponential model [1] and extend the
results also deriving the equations for the non-minimal coupled scenario. The
predictions of both models are tested in light of the latest temperature and
polarization maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background and clustering data. We
also compare the predictions of these models with the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), and find that the
observational data show a moderate preference for the non-minimally coupled
$\beta$-exponential inflationary model.

potentially yield better performance. We illustrate this in our empirical
results on standard semantic segmentation datasets, where several

the presence of unknown environmental structure and dynamic conditions. The
problem is richer still when such structure includes occlusion, which causes
the loss of line-of-sight (LOS) between the acoustic source and the receivers,
on which many of the existing localization algorithms rely. We develop a
semi-blind passive localization method capable of accurately estimating the
source's position even in the possible absence of LOS between the source and
all receivers. Based on typically-available prior knowledge of the water
surface and bottom, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal
estimator under a multi-ray propagation model, which is suitable for
shallow-water environments and high-frequency signals. By exploiting a
computationally efficient form of this estimator, our methodology makes
comparatively high-resolution localization feasible. We also derive the
Cram\'er-Rao bound for this model, which can be used to guide the placement of
collections of receivers so as to optimize localization accuracy. The method
improves a balance of accuracy and robustness to environmental model mismatch,
relative to existing localization methods that are useful in similar settings.
The method is validated with simulations and water tank experiments.

near-optimal expert demonstrations. However, high-quality demonstrations from
human experts can be expensive to obtain in large numbers. On the other hand,
it is often much easier to obtain large quantities of suboptimal or
task-agnostic trajectories, which are not useful for direct imitation, but can
nevertheless provide insight into the dynamical structure of the environment,
showing what could be done in the environment even if not what should be done.
We ask the question, is it possible to utilize such suboptimal offline datasets
to facilitate provably improved downstream imitation learning? In this work, we
answer this question affirmatively and present training objectives that use
offline datasets to learn a factored transition model whose structure enables
the extraction of a latent action space. Our theoretical analysis shows that
the learned latent action space can boost the sample-efficiency of downstream
imitation learning, effectively reducing the need for large near-optimal expert
datasets through the use of auxiliary non-expert data. To learn the latent
action space in practice, we propose TRAIL (Transition-Reparametrized Actions
for Imitation Learning), an algorithm that learns an energy-based transition
model contrastively, and uses the transition model to reparametrize the action
space for sample-efficient imitation learning. We evaluate the practicality of
our objective through experiments on a set of navigation and locomotion tasks.
Our results verify the benefits suggested by our theory and show that TRAIL is
able to improve baseline imitation learning by up to 4x in performance.

opposite limits of a continuum of pairing interaction strength between
fermions. A crossover between these limits is readily observed in a cold atomic
Fermi gas. Whether it occurs in other systems such as the high temperature
superconducting cuprates has remained an open question. We uncover here
unambiguous evidence for a BCS-BEC crossover in the cuprates by identifying a
universal magic gap ratio 2\Delta/k_BT_c ~ 6.5 (where \Delta is the pairing gap
and Tc is the transition temperature) at which paired fermion condensates
become optimally robust. At this gap ratio, corresponding to the unitary point
in a cold atomic Fermi gas, the condensate fraction N_0 and the height of the
jump \delta\gamma(Tc) in the coefficient \gamma of the fermionic specific heat
at Tc are strongly peaked. In the cuprates, \delta\gamma(Tc) is peaked at this
gap ratio when \Delta corresponds to the antinodal spectroscopic gap, thus
reinforcing its interpretation as the pairing gap. We find the peak in
\delta\gamma(Tc) also to coincide with a normal state maximum in \gamma, which
is indicative of a pairing fluctuation pseudogap above Tc.

planning in dynamic environments. Motion planning methods for autonomous
driving and mobile robots typically need to rely on the spatial constraints
imposed by a map-based global planner to generate a collision-free trajectory.
These methods may fail without an offline map or where the map is invalid due
to dynamic changes in the environment such as road obstruction, construction,
and traffic congestion. To address this problem, triangulation-based methods
can be used to obtain a spatial constraint. However, the existing methods fall
short when dealing with dynamic environments and may lead the motion planner to
an unrecoverable state. In this paper, we propose a new method to generate a
sequence of channels across different triangulation mesh topologies to serve as
the spatial constraints. This can be applied to motion planning of autonomous
vehicles or robots in cluttered, unstructured environments. The proposed method
is evaluated and compared with other triangulation-based methods in synthetic
and complex scenarios collected from a real-world autonomous driving dataset.
We have shown that the proposed method results in a more stable, long-term plan
with a higher task completion rate, faster arrival time, a higher rate of
successful plans, and fewer collisions compared to existing methods.

cardiopulmonary diseases classification and localization on chest radiography.
Millions of people get affected and die due to these diseases without an
accurate and timely diagnosis. Recently proposed contrastive learning heavily
relies on data augmentation, especially positive data augmentation. However,
generating clinically-accurate data augmentations for medical images is
extremely difficult because the common data augmentation methods in computer
vision, such as sharp, blur, and crop operations, can severely alter the
clinical settings of medical images. In this paper, we proposed a novel and
simple data augmentation method based on patient metadata and supervised
knowledge to create clinically accurate positive and negative augmentations for
chest X-rays. We introduce an end-to-end framework, SCALP, which extends the
self-supervised contrastive approach to a supervised setting. Specifically,
SCALP pulls together chest X-rays from the same patient (positive keys) and
pushes apart chest X-rays from different patients (negative keys). In addition,
it uses ResNet-50 along with the triplet-attention mechanism to identify
cardiopulmonary diseases, and Grad-CAM++ to highlight the abnormal regions. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that SCALP outperforms existing baselines
with significant margins in both classification and localization tasks.
Specifically, the average classification AUCs improve from 82.8% (SOTA using
DenseNet-121) to 83.9% (SCALP using ResNet-50), while the localization results
improve on average by 3.7% over different IoU thresholds.

positioning for a target localization problem where a fixed target broadcasts
mmWave signals and a mobile robotic agent attempts to capture the signals to
locate and navigate to the target. A three-stage procedure is proposed: First,
the mobile agent uses tensor decomposition methods to detect the multipath
channel components and estimate their parameters. Second, a machine-learning
trained classifier is then used to predict the link state, meaning if the
strongest path is line-of-sight (LOS) or non-LOS (NLOS). For the NLOS case, the
link state predictor also determines if the strongest path arrived via one or
more reflections. Third, based on the link state, the agent either follows the
estimated angles or uses computer vision or other sensor to explore and map the
environment. The method is demonstrated on a large dataset of indoor

integrated into a state-of-the-art neural simultaneous localization and mapping

Poisson-based alternatives often lack sufficient modeling flexibility. We
introduce a novel semiparametric methodology for count time series by warping a
Gaussian DLM. The warping function has two components: a (nonparametric)
transformation operator that provides distributional flexibility and a rounding
operator that ensures the correct support for the discrete data-generating
process. We develop conjugate inference for the warped DLM, which enables
analytic and recursive updates for the state space filtering and smoothing
distributions. We leverage these results to produce customized and efficient
algorithms for inference and forecasting, including Monte Carlo simulation for
offline analysis and an optimal particle filter for online inference. This
framework unifies and extends a variety of discrete time series models and is
valid for natural counts, rounded values, and multivariate observations.
Simulation studies illustrate the excellent forecasting capabilities of the
warped DLM. The proposed approach is applied to a multivariate time series of
daily overdose counts and demonstrates both modeling and computational
successes.

dissipation events as well as Coulomb collisions. In contrast to the previous
simulations, we implement realistic photon-to-particle number ratios of
$N_{\gamma}/N_e \sim 10^{5}$ or higher, that are consistent with the observed
radiation efficiency of relativistic jets. Using our Monte Carlo radiation
transfer (MCRaT) code, we can successfully model the prompt emission spectra
when the electrons are momentarily accelerated to highly relativistic energies
(Lorentz factor $\sim 50-100$) after getting powered by $\sim30-50$ episodic
dissipation events in addition to their Coulomb coupling with the jet protons,
and for baryonic outflows that originate from moderate optical depths
$\sim20-30$. We also show that the resultant shape of the photon spectrum is
practically independent of the initial photon energy distribution and the jet
baryonic energy content, and hence independent of the emission mechanism.

systems, from colloid dispersions for sensing, to heterostructured
photocatalysts. Randomness, however, imposes severe challenges for
nanophotonics modeling, often constrained by the irregular geometry of the
scatterers involved or the stochastic nature of the problem itself. In this
article, we resolve this conundrum by presenting a universal theory of averaged
light scattering of randomly oriented objects. Specifically, we derive formulas
of orientation-and-polarization-averaged absorption cross section, scattering
cross section and asymmetry parameter, for single or collection of objects of
arbitrary shape, that can be solved by any electromagnetic scattering method.
These three parameters can be directly integrated into traditional unpolarized
radiative energy transfer modelling, enabling a practical tool to predict
multiple scattering and light transport in disordered nanostructured materials.
Notably, the formulas of average light scattering can be derived under the
principles of fluctuational electrodynamics, allowing analogous mathematical
treatment to the methods used in thermal radiation, non-equilibrium
electromagnetic forces, and other associated phenomena. The proposed modelling
framework is validated against optical measurements of polymer composite films
with metal-oxide microcrystals. Our work sets a new paradigm in the theory of
light scattering, that may contribute to a better understanding of light-matter
interactions in applications such as, plasmonics for sensing and photothermal
therapy, photocatalysts for water splitting and CO2 dissociation, photonic

complicated photonic circuit states under challenging physical constraints,
then performs photonic core mapping via combined analytical solving and
zeroth-order optimization. A subspace learning procedure with multi-level
sparsity is integrated into L2ight to enable in-situ gradient evaluation and
fast adaptation, unleashing the power of optics for real on-chip intelligence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed L2ight outperforms prior ONN
training protocols with 3-order-of-magnitude higher scalability and over 30X
better efficiency, when benchmarked on various models and learning tasks. This
synergistic framework is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that

at least $k$ and it is a minimum $k$-cut-set if it has the least cost among all
$k$-cut-sets. For fixed $k$, we call the problem of finding a minimum
$k$-cut-set as Hypergraph-$k$-Cut and the problem of enumerating all minimum
$k$-cut-sets as Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut. The special cases of
Hypergraph-$k$-Cut and Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut restricted to graph inputs are
well-known to be solvable in (randomized as well as deterministic) polynomial
time. In contrast, it is only recently that polynomial-time algorithms for
Hypergraph-$k$-Cut were developed. The randomized polynomial-time algorithm for
Hypergraph-$k$-Cut that was designed in 2018 (Chandrasekaran, Xu, and Yu, SODA
2018) showed that the number of minimum $k$-cut-sets in a hypergraph is
$O(n^{2k-2})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input hypergraph, and
that they can all be enumerated in randomized polynomial time, thus resolving
Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut in randomized polynomial time. A deterministic
polynomial-time algorithm for Hypergraph-$k$-Cut was subsequently designed in
2020 (Chandrasekaran and Chekuri, FOCS 2020), but it is not guaranteed to
enumerate all minimum $k$-cut-sets. In this work, we give the first
deterministic polynomial-time algorithm to solve Enum-Hypergraph-$k$-Cut (this
is non-trivial even for $k = 2$). Our algorithms are based on new structural
results that allow for efficient recovery of all minimum $k$-cut-sets by
solving minimum $(S,T)$-terminal cuts. Our techniques give new structural

with periodic boundary conditions (which may not model real GMC boundary
conditions). We develop and test a new GMC simulation setup (called TURBSPHERE)
that combines advantages of both approaches: we continuously stir an isolated
cloud to model the energy cascade from larger scales, and use a static
potential to confine the gas. The resulting cloud and surrounding envelope
achieve a quasi-equilibrium state with the desired hallmarks of supersonic ISM
turbulence (e.g. density PDF and a $\sim k^{-2}$ velocity power spectrum),
whose bulk properties can be tuned as desired. We use the final stirred state
as initial conditions for star formation simulations with self-gravity, both
with and without continued driving and protostellar jet feedback, respectively.
We then disentangle the respective effects of the turbulent cascade, simulation
geometry, external driving, and gravity/MHD boundary conditions on the
resulting star formation. Without external driving, the new setup obtains
results similar to previous simple spherical cloud setups, but external driving
can suppress star formation considerably in the new setup. Periodic box
simulations with the same dimensions and turbulence parameters form stars
significantly slower, highlighting the importance of boundary conditions and
the presence or absence of a global collapse mode in the results of star

effective at learning a policy to perform control tasks. One issue with methods
like Q-Learning is that the value update introduces bias when predicting the TD
target of a unfamiliar state. Estimation noise becomes a bias after the max
operator in the policy improvement step, and carries over to value estimations
of other states, causing Q-Learning to overestimate the Q value. Algorithms
like Soft Q-Learning (SQL) introduce the notion of a soft-greedy policy, which
reduces the estimation bias via soft updates in early stages of training.
However, the inverse temperature $\beta$ that controls the softness of an
update is usually set by a hand-designed heuristic, which can be inaccurate at
capturing the uncertainty in the target estimate. Under the belief that $\beta$
is closely related to the (state dependent) model uncertainty, Entropy

atmospheric gas volume mixing ratio constraints on both H2O and CO (9.5$\times
10^{-5}$ - 1.5$\times 10^{-4}$ and 1.2$\times 10^{-4}$ - 2.6$\times 10^{-4}$,
respectively). From these bounded constraints, we are able to derive the
atmospheric C/H (0.35$^{+0.17}_{-0.10}$ $\times$ Solar) and O/H (0.32
$^{+0.12}_{-0.08}$ $\times$ Solar) abundances and the corresponding atmospheric
carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O=0.59$\pm$0.08; the solar value is 0.55). The
sub-solar (C+O)/H (0.33$^{+0.13}_{-0.09}$ $\times$ Solar) is suggestive of a
metal-depleted atmosphere relative to what is expected for Jovian-like planets
while the near solar value of C/O rules out the disk-free migration/C-rich
atmosphere scenario.

these linear scan algorithms generate drastic speed-up of up to hundreds of

with reduced contrast due to spatial crosstalk, in which the signal at each
point is the result of a superposition from neighboring points that are

as a solution to this problem. Today, laser scanning confocal fluorescence
microscopy is broadly used due to its high depth resolution and sensitivity,
which come at the price of photobleaching, chemical, and photo-toxicity. Here,
we present artificial confocal microscopy (ACM) to achieve confocal-level depth
sectioning, sensitivity, and chemical specificity, on unlabeled specimens,
nondestructively. We augmented a laser scanning confocal instrument with a
quantitative phase imaging module, which provides optical pathlength maps of
the specimen on the same field of view as the fluorescence channel. Using pairs
of phase and fluorescence images, we trained a convolution neural network to
translate the former into the latter. The training to infer a new tag is very
practical as the input and ground truth data are intrinsically registered and
the data acquisition is automated. Remarkably, the ACM images present
significantly stronger depth sectioning than the input images, enabling us to
recover confocal-like tomographic volumes of microspheres, hippocampal neurons
in culture, and 3D liver cancer spheroids. By training on nucleus-specific
tags, ACM allows for segmenting individual nuclei within dense spheroids for
both cell counting and volume measurements. Furthermore, taking the estimated
fluorescence volumes, as annotation for the phase data, we extracted dry mass
information for individual nuclei. Finally, our results indicate that the
network learning can be transferred between spheroids suspended in different
media.

concurrent systems. Despite of its popularity, model checking suffers from the
state space explosion problem that restricts it from being applied to certain
systems, or specifications. Many works have been proposed in the past to
address the state space explosion problem, and they have achieved some success,
but the inherent complexity still remains an obstacle for purely symbolic
approaches. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based
approach for model checking, where the model is expressed using a B{\""u}chi
automaton and the property to be verified is expressed using Linear Temporal
Logic (LTL). We express the model as a GNN, and propose a novel node embedding
framework that encodes the LTL property and characteristics of the model. We
reduce the LTL model checking problem to a graph classification problem, where
there are two classes, 1 (if the model satisfies the specification) and 0 (if
the model does not satisfy the specification). The experimental results show
that our framework is up to 17 times faster than state-of-the-art tools. Our
approach is particularly useful when dealing with very large LTL formulae and
small to moderate sized models.

decide whether the algebraic monodromy group $\mathbf{H}_{Z}$ of any

S_{\mathbb{C}}$ is ""large enough"", in the sense that a certain orbit of
$\mathbf{H}_{Z}$ in a variety of Hodge flags has dimension bounded from below
by a certain quantity. In this article we give an effective method for deciding
this question. Combined with the effective methods of Lawrence-Venkatesh for
understanding semisimplifications of global Galois representations using
$p$-adic Hodge theory, this gives a fully effective strategy for solving

We discuss two broad approaches to estimating these weights: the more
traditional one, which fits a propensity score model and then uses the
reciprocal of the estimated propensity score to construct weights, and the
balancing approach, which estimates the inverse propensity weights essentially
by the method of moments, finding weights that achieve balance in the sample.
We review ideas from the causal inference, sample surveys, and semiparametric
estimation literatures, with particular attention to the role of balance as a
sufficient condition for robust inference. We focus on the inverse propensity

groups and may have a critical role in how people understand language directed
toward minority social groups. Here, we assess the role of social stereotypes
in the automated detection of hateful language by examining the relation
between individual annotator biases and erroneous classification of texts by
hate speech classifiers. Specifically, in Study 1 we investigate the impact of
novice annotators' stereotypes on their hate-speech-annotation behavior. In
Study 2 we examine the effect of language-embedded stereotypes on expert
annotators' aggregated judgements in a large annotated corpus. Finally, in
Study 3 we demonstrate how language-embedded stereotypes are associated with
systematic prediction errors in a neural-network hate speech classifier. Our
results demonstrate that hate speech classifiers learn human-like biases which
can further perpetuate social inequalities when propagated at scale. This
framework, combining social psychological and computational linguistic methods,
provides insights into additional sources of bias in hate speech moderation,
informing ongoing debates regarding fairness in machine learning.

converse of quantum channel hypothesis testing under coherent strategies,
meaning that any strategy to make the Type II error decays with an exponent
larger than the regularized channel relative entropy will unavoidably result in
the Type I error converging to one exponentially fast in the asymptotic limit.
This conjecture will imply the desirable quantum channel Stein's Lemma and the
continuity of the regularized (amortized) Sandwiched R\'{e}nyi channel
divergence at $\alpha=1$. We also remark that there was a gap in the proof of
the above conjecture in our previous arXiv version. Such gap exists since a
lemma basically comes from [Brandao and Plenio, 2010] was found to be false.
Second, we develop a framework to show the interplay between the strategies of
channel discrimination, the operational regimes, and variants of channel
divergences. This framework systematically underlies the operational meaning of
quantum channel divergences in quantum channel discrimination. Our work makes
an attempt towards understanding the ultimate limit of quantum channel
discrimination, as well as its connection to quantum channel divergences in the

incorporating simultaneously measured behaviour into these models to further
disentangle sources of neural variability in their latent space. These
approaches, however, are limited in their ability to capture the underlying
neural dynamics (e.g. linear) and in their ability to relate the learned

introduce Targeted Neural Dynamical Modeling (TNDM), a nonlinear state-space
model that jointly models the neural activity and external behavioural
variables. TNDM decomposes neural dynamics into behaviourally relevant and
behaviourally irrelevant dynamics; the relevant dynamics are used to
reconstruct the behaviour through a flexible linear decoder and both sets of
dynamics are used to reconstruct the neural activity through a linear decoder
with no time lag. We implement TNDM as a sequential variational autoencoder and
validate it on simulated recordings and recordings taken from the premotor and

TNDM is able to learn low-dimensional latent dynamics that are highly

overfitting. Adversarial training, which augments data with the worst-case
adversarial examples, has been widely demonstrated to improve model's
robustness against adversarial attacks and generalization ability. However,
while the previous adversarial training generally focuses on protecting GNNs
from spiteful attacks, it remains unclear how the adversarial training could
improve the generalization abilities of GNNs in the graph analytics problem. In
this paper, we investigate GNNs from the lens of weight and feature loss
landscapes, i.e., the loss changes with respect to model weights and node
features, respectively. We draw the conclusion that GNNs are prone to falling
into sharp local minima in these two loss landscapes, where GNNs possess poor
generalization performances. To tackle this problem, we construct the
co-adversarial perturbation (CAP) optimization problem in terms of weights and
features, and design the alternating adversarial perturbation algorithm to
flatten the weight and feature loss landscapes alternately. Furthermore, we
divide the training process into two stages: one conducting the standard
cross-entropy minimization to ensure the quick convergence of GNN models, the
other applying our alternating adversarial training to avoid falling into
locally sharp minima. The extensive experiments demonstrate our CAP can
generally improve the generalization performance of GNNs on a variety of

problem, but the same cannot be said for circular words despite growing
interests on the latter due to their applications -- for example, in splicing
systems. Meanwhile, Parikh matrices are useful tools and well established in
the study of subword occurrences. In this work, we propose two ways of counting
subword occurrences in circular words. We then extend the idea of Parikh
matrices to the context of circular words and investigate this extension.
Motivated by the word inference problem, we study ambiguity in the
identification of a circular word by its Parikh matrix. Accordingly, two
rewriting rules are developed to generate ternary circular words which share
the same Parikh matrix.

determine whether there is an abnormality. Compare with vision information that
is easily occluded, audio signals have a certain degree of penetration. Thus,
this paper attempt to exploit multi-modal learning for modeling the audio and

to model different types of information. The first is a typical 3D CNN model to
extract temporal appearance features from video clips. The second is an audio

(e.g. social relation analysis). A fundamental problem for graph representation
learning is how to effectively learn representations without human labeling,
which is usually costly and time-consuming. Graph contrastive learning (GCL)
addresses this problem by pulling the positive node pairs (or similar nodes)
closer while pushing the negative node pairs (or dissimilar nodes) apart in the
representation space. Despite the success of the existing GCL methods, they
primarily sample node pairs based on the node-level proximity yet the community

from the same community might be sampled as a negative pair. We argue that the
community information should be considered to identify node pairs in the same

issue, we propose a novel Graph Communal Contrastive Learning (gCooL) framework
to jointly learn the community partition and learn node representations in an
end-to-end fashion. Specifically, the proposed gCooL consists of two
components: a Dense Community Aggregation (DeCA) algorithm for community

scheme to utilize the community information. Additionally, the real-world

demonstrate that the proposed gCooL can also be naturally adapted to multiplex

whether and how to allocate a single indivisible object to a queue of strategic

a resource (e.g., time, memory, cores) naturally reveal additional, or implicit
feedback. For example, if a system waits X min for an event to occur, then it
automatically learns what would have happened if it waited <X min, because time
has a cumulative property. This feedback tells us about alternative decisions,
and can be used to improve the system policy. However, leveraging implicit
feedback is difficult because it tends to be one-sided or incomplete, and may
depend on the outcome of the event. As a result, existing practices for using
feedback, such as simply incorporating it into a data-driven model, suffer from
bias.
  We develop a methodology, called Sayer, that leverages implicit feedback to
evaluate and train new system policies. Sayer builds on two ideas from
reinforcement learning -- randomized exploration and unbiased counterfactual
estimators -- to leverage data collected by an existing policy to estimate the
performance of new candidate policies, without actually deploying those
policies. Sayer uses implicit exploration and implicit data augmentation to
generate implicit feedback in an unbiased form, which is then used by an
implicit counterfactual estimator to evaluate and train new policies. The key
idea underlying these techniques is to assign implicit probabilities to
decisions that are not actually taken but whose feedback can be inferred; these
probabilities are carefully calculated to ensure statistical unbiasedness. We
apply Sayer to two production scenarios in Azure, and show that it can evaluate
arbitrary policies accurately, and train new policies that outperform the

presented using Drell-Yan (DY) events produced in proton-antiproton collisions
by the Tevatron collider at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. This paper
adopts a novel approach which uses the mean value of the Z/$\gamma^*$
transverse momentum $<p_T^{DY}>$ in DY events as a powerful observable to
characterize the effect of ISR. In a data sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 9.4 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the CDF Run II detector,
$<p_T^{DY}>$ is measured as a function of the Z/$\gamma^*$ invariant mass. It
is found that these two observables have a dependence, $<p_T^{DY}> = -8 + 2.2
\ln m_{DY}^2$ [GeV/c], where $m_{DY}$ is the value of the Z/$\gamma^*$ mass
measured in units of GeV/$c^2$. This linear dependence is observed for the
first time in this analysis. It may be exploited to model the effect of ISR and
constrain its impact in other processes.

estimation of two-way relaying network (TWRN) aided by an intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS) with finite discrete phase shifters. In a TWRN, there
exists a challenging problem that the two cascading channels from
source-to-IRS-to-Relay and destination-to-IRS-to-relay interfere with each
other. Via designing the initial phase shifts of IRS and pilot pattern, the two
cascading channels are separated by using simple arithmetic operations like
addition and subtraction. Then, the least-squares estimator is adopted to
estimate the two cascading channels and two direct channels from source to
relay and destination to relay. The corresponding mean square errors (MSE) of
channel estimators are derived. By minimizing MSE, the optimal phase shift
matrix of IRS is proved. Then, two special matrices Hadamard and discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) matrix is shown to be two optimal training matrices for
IRS. Furthermore, the IRS with discrete finite phase shifters is taken into
account. Using theoretical derivation and numerical simulations, we find that
3-4 bits phase shifters are sufficient for IRS to achieve a negligible MSE
performance loss. More importantly, the Hadamard matrix requires only one-bit
phase shifters to achieve the optimal MSE performance while the DFT matrix
requires at least three or four bits to achieve the same performance. Thus, the
Hadamard matrix is a perfect choice for channel estimation using low-resolution
phase-shifting IRS.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are proved to be vulnerable against backdoor
attacks. A backdoor is often embedded in the target DNNs through injecting a
backdoor trigger into training examples, which can cause the target DNNs
misclassify an input attached with the backdoor trigger. Existing backdoor
detection methods often require the access to the original poisoned training
data, the parameters of the target DNNs, or the predictive confidence for each
given input, which are impractical in many real-world applications, e.g.,
on-device deployed DNNs. We address the black-box hard-label backdoor detection
problem where the DNN is fully black-box and only its final output label is
accessible. We approach this problem from the optimization perspective and show
that the objective of backdoor detection is bounded by an adversarial
objective. Further theoretical and empirical studies reveal that this
adversarial objective leads to a solution with highly skewed distribution; a
singularity is often observed in the adversarial map of a backdoor-infected
example, which we call the adversarial singularity phenomenon. Based on this
observation, we propose the adversarial extreme value analysis(AEVA) to detect
backdoors in black-box neural networks. AEVA is based on an extreme value
analysis of the adversarial map, computed from the monte-carlo gradient
estimation. Evidenced by extensive experiments across multiple popular tasks
and backdoor attacks, our approach is shown effective in detecting backdoor
attacks under the black-box hard-label scenarios.

entropy rate for Markov chains. Convergence of certain statistics of long range
dependent processes, such as the sample mean, is slow. It has been shown in
Carpio and Daley \cite{carpio2007long} that the convergence of the $n$-step
transition probabilities to the stationary distribution is slow, without
quantifying the convergence rate. We prove that the slow convergence also
applies to convergence to an information-theoretic measure, the entropy rate,
by showing that the convergence rate is equivalent to the convergence rate of
the $n$-step transition probabilities to the stationary distribution, which is
equivalent to the Markov chain mixing time problem. Then we quantify this
convergence rate, and show that it is $O(n^{2H-2})$, where $n$ is the number of
steps of the Markov chain and $H$ is the Hurst parameter. Finally, we show that
due to this slow convergence, the mutual information between past and future is
infinite if and only if the Markov chain is long range dependent. This is a
discrete analogue of characterisations which have been shown for other long
range dependent processes.

varies considerably with time and is sometimes asymmetric rather than being
uniform across a ring. To understand what controls temporal and spatial
distributions of ring star formation, we run semi-global, hydrodynamic
simulations of nuclear rings subject to time-varying and/or asymmetric mass
inflow rates. These controlled variations in the inflow lead to variations in
the star formation, while the ring orbital period ($18\,{\rm Myr}$) and radius
($600\,{\rm pc}$) remain approximately constant. We find that both the mass
inflow rate and supernova feedback affect the ring SFR. An oscillating inflow
rate with period $\Delta \tau_\text{in}$ and amplitude 20 causes
large-amplitude (a factor of $\gtrsim 5$), quasi-periodic variations of the
SFR, when $\Delta \tau_\text{in} \gtrsim 50\,{\rm Myr}$. We find that the
time-varying ISM weight and midplane pressure track each other closely,
establishing an instantaneous vertical equilibrium. The measured time-varying
depletion time is consistent with the prediction from self-regulation theory
provided the time delay between star formation and supernova feedback is taken
into account. The supernova feedback is responsible only for small-amplitude (a
factor of $\sim 2$) fluctuations of the SFR with a timescale $\lesssim 40\,{\rm
Myr}$. Asymmetry in the inflow rate does not necessarily lead to asymmetric
star formation in nuclear rings. Only when the inflow rate from one dust lane
is suddenly increased by a large factor, the rings undergo a transient period
of lopsided star formation.

protocol: At each round, the learner proposes a query asking for the label of
an instance $x^q$, the teacher provides the requested label $\{x^q, y^q\}$
along with explanatory information to guide the learning process. In this
paper, we view this information in the form of an additional contrastive

  Knowledge Graphs",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.DB cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge graphs (KGs) capture knowledge in the form of head--relation--tail
triples and are a crucial component in many AI systems. There are two important
reasoning tasks on KGs: (1) single-hop knowledge graph completion, which
involves predicting individual links in the KG; and (2), multi-hop reasoning,
where the goal is to predict which KG entities satisfy a given logical query.
Embedding-based methods solve both tasks by first computing an embedding for
each entity and relation, then using them to form predictions. However,
existing scalable KG embedding frameworks only support single-hop knowledge
graph completion and cannot be applied to the more challenging multi-hop
reasoning task. Here we present Scalable Multi-hOp REasoning (SMORE), the first
general framework for both single-hop and multi-hop reasoning in KGs. Using a
single machine SMORE can perform multi-hop reasoning in Freebase KG (86M
entities, 338M edges), which is 1,500x larger than previously considered KGs.
The key to SMORE's runtime performance is a novel bidirectional rejection
sampling that achieves a square root reduction of the complexity of online
training data generation. Furthermore, SMORE exploits asynchronous scheduling,
overlapping CPU-based data sampling, GPU-based embedding computation, and
frequent CPU--GPU IO. SMORE increases throughput (i.e., training speed) over
prior multi-hop KG frameworks by 2.2x with minimal GPU memory requirements (2GB
for training 400-dim embeddings on 86M-node Freebase) and achieves near linear
speed-up with the number of GPUs. Moreover, on the simpler single-hop knowledge
graph completion task SMORE achieves comparable or even better runtime

where a team of robots is tasked with transporting a set of tasks, each from an
initial location and each to a specified target location. Appearing in the
context of automated warehouse logistics and automated mail sortation, MAPD
requires first deciding which robot is assigned what task (i.e., Task
Assignment or TA) followed by a subsequent coordination problem where each
robot must be assigned collision-free paths so as to successfully complete its
assignment (i.e., Multi-Agent Path Finding or MAPF). Leading methods in this
area solve MAPD sequentially: first assigning tasks, then assigning paths. In
this work we propose a new coupled method where task assignment choices are
informed by actual delivery costs instead of by lower-bound estimates. The main
ingredients of our approach are a marginal-cost assignment heuristic and a
meta-heuristic improvement strategy based on Large Neighbourhood Search. As a
further contribution, we also consider a variant of the MAPD problem where each
robot can carry multiple tasks instead of just one. Numerical simulations show
that our approach yields efficient and timely solutions and we report
significant improvement compared with other recent methods from the literature.

provide different dissipation channels that prevent complete destructive
interference of the cooling pathway, and thus eliminating the dark modes. The
cooling rate and limit are explicitly specified, in which the
distinguishability of the optical modes to the mechanical modes is found to be
critical for an efficient cooling process. In a realistic multi-mode
optomechanical system, ground-state cooling of all mechanical modes is
demonstrated by sequentially introducing optical drives, proving the

covariant variational approach. This covariant variational approach brings to
the forefront the geometric structure of the underlying perturbation theory, as
opposed to a more commonly used `direct approach', that ignores the variational
origin. In addition, it offers a clear calculational advantage with respect to
so called `gauge fixed' treatments that distinguish tangential and normal
modes, as it emphasizes the symmetries of the geometric models that describe
the brane dynamics. We restrict our attention to a brane action that depends at
most on first derivatives of the embedding functions of the worldvolume spanned
by the brane in its evolution. We consider first and second variations of the
action that describes the brane dynamics. The first variation produces the
equations of motion, as is well known. In the second variation we derive the
Jacobi equations for these kind of models, and we emphasize the role of the
Hessian matrix. This is extended to third order in variations, first in a flat
and then in a curved spacetime background. Further, we specialize to the
relevant case of the Dirac-Nambu-Goto action that describes extremal branes.
The proper setting of a covariant variational approach allows to go in
principle to geometric models that depend on higher derivatives of the

intermediate references of degraded quality are often available, e.g., at the

establish a new paradigm named degraded-reference IQA (DR IQA). Specifically,
we lay out the architectures of DR IQA and introduce a 6-bit code to denote the

dedicated to DR IQA and will make them publicly available. We make novel
observations on distortion behavior in multi-stage distortion pipelines by
comprehensively analyzing five multiple distortion combinations. Based on these

The results suggest that DR IQA may offer significant performance improvement
in multiple distortion environments, thereby establishing DR IQA as a valid IQA

the weights are similar to those of the other and, therefore, can be skipped by
reusing the already-computed results. We propose a novel scheme, called
MERCURY, to exploit input similarity during DNN training in a hardware
accelerator. MERCURY uses Random Projection with Quantization (RPQ) to convert
an input vector to a bit sequence, called Signature. A cache (MCACHE) stores
signatures of recent input vectors along with the computed results. If the
Signature of a new input vector matches that of an already existing vector in
the MCACHE, the two vectors are found to have similarities. Therefore, the
already-computed result is reused for the new vector. To the best of our

for accelerating DNN training in hardware. The paper presents a detailed
design, workflow, and implementation of the MERCURY. Our experimental

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the form of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep
Learning (DL) techniques in fighting against the effects of novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19). Objective & Methods: The objective is to perform a scoping
review on AI for COVID-19 using preferred reporting items of systematic reviews
and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was performed for
relevant studies published from 1 January 2020 till 27 March 2021. Out of 4050
research papers available in reputed publishers, a full-text review of 440
articles was done based on the keywords of AI, COVID-19, ML, forecasting, DL,
X-ray, and Computed Tomography (CT). Finally, 52 articles were included in the
result synthesis of this paper. As part of the review, different ML regression
methods were reviewed first in predicting the number of confirmed and death
cases. Secondly, a comprehensive survey was carried out on the use of ML in
classifying COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, different datasets on medical imaging
were compared in terms of the number of images, number of positive samples and
number of classes in the datasets. The different stages of the diagnosis,
including preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction were also
reviewed. Fourthly, the performance results of different research papers were
compared to evaluate the effectiveness of DL methods on different datasets.
Results: Results show that residual neural network (ResNet-18) and densely
connected convolutional network (DenseNet 169) exhibit excellent classification
accuracy for X-ray images, while DenseNet-201 has the maximum accuracy in
classifying CT scan images. This indicates that ML and DL are useful tools in
assisting researchers and medical professionals in predicting, screening and
detecting COVID-19.

With the
rise of IoT technology, which is one of the most used technologies, billions of
IoT devices are interconnected over the Internet. However, DoS/DDoS attacks are
the most frequent and perilous threat to this growing technology. New types of
DDoS attacks are highly advanced and complicated, and it is almost impossible
to detect or mitigate by the existing intrusion detection systems and
traditional methods. Fortunately, Big Data, Data mining, and Machine Learning
technologies make it possible to detect DDoS traffic effectively. This paper
suggests a DDoS detection model based on data mining and machine learning
techniques. For writing this paper, the latest available Dataset, CICDDoS2019,
experimented with the most popular machine learning algorithms and specified
the most correlated features with predicted classes are being used. It is
discovered that AdaBoost and XGBoost were extraordinarily accurate and
correctly predicted the type of network traffic with 100% accuracy. Future
research can be extended by enhancing the model for multiclassification of
different DDoS attack types and testing hybrid algorithms and newer datasets on
this model.

increase or decrease naturally gives rise to a trading strategy that follows
the prediction and thus always has a position in the market. Selective
classification extends a binary or many-class classifier to allow it to abstain
from making a prediction for certain inputs, thereby allowing a trade-off
between the accuracy of the resulting selective classifier against coverage of
the input feature space. Selective classifiers give rise to trading strategies
that do not take a trading position when the classifier abstains. We
investigate the application of binary and ternary selective classification to
trading strategy design. For ternary classification, in addition to classes for
the price going up or down, we include a third class that corresponds to
relatively small price moves in either direction, and gives the classifier
another way to avoid making a directional prediction. We use a walk-forward
train-validate-test approach to evaluate and compare binary and ternary,
selective and non-selective classifiers across several different feature sets

activated by applying a dc electric field that induces a density gradient or a

paper, we propose a feature fusion network based on transformer architecture.
Benefiting from the self-attention mechanism, the transformer encoder captures
the inter- and intra- relations among different regions of the point cloud. By
using cross-attention, the transformer decoder fuses features and includes more
target cues into the current point cloud feature to compute the region
attentions, which makes the similarity computing more efficient. Based on this
feature fusion network, we propose an end-to-end point cloud object tracking
framework, a simple yet effective method for 3D object tracking using point

$a\mathrm{\sin}i = 14.984 \pm 0.048\ R_\odot$ are obtained by fitting the RV

period of the spots $P_{rot}=4.32\ d$ is slightly longer than the orbital

3D LIDAR as the main sensing modality, and the accurate LIDAR-based
Localization and Mapping algorithm, LOAM, as the state estimation framework, we
show that in the absence of a navigation policy, drift rapidly accumulates in
the presence of moving objects. To overcome this, we learn actions that lead to
drift-minimized navigation through a suitable set of reward and penalty
functions. We use Proximal Policy Optimization, a class of Deep Reinforcement
Learning methods, to learn the actions that result in drift-minimized
trajectories. We show by extensive comparisons on a variety of synthetic, yet
photo-realistic scenes made available through the CARLA Simulator the superior
performance of the proposed framework vis-a-vis methods that do not adopt such
policies.

through its thermal X-ray emission. Its location at high Galactic latitude
($b=+37^\circ$) is unusual if Calvera is a relatively young pulsar, as
suggested by its spin period (59 ms) and period derivative ($3.2 \times
10^{-15}$ Hz s$^{-1}$). Using the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer
(NICER), we obtained a phase-connected timing solution spanning four years
which allowed us to measure the second derivative of the frequency $\ddot\nu =
-2.5 \times 10^{-23}$ Hz s$^{-2}$ and to reveal timing noise consistent with
that of normal radio pulsars. A magnetized hydrogen atmosphere model, covering
the entire star surface, provides a good description of the phase-resolved
spectra and energy-dependent pulsed fraction. However, we find that a
temperature map more anisotropic than that produced by a dipole field is
required, with a hotter zone concentrated towards the poles. By adding two
small polar caps, we find that the surface effective temperature and that of
the caps are ~0.1 and ~0.36 keV, respectively. The inferred distance is ~3.3
kpc. We confirm the presence of an absorption line at 0.7 keV associated to the
emission from the whole star surface, difficult to interpret as a cyclotron
feature and more likely originating from atomic transitions. We searched for
pulsed $\gamma$-ray emission by folding seven years of Fermi-LAT data using the
X-ray ephemeris, but no evidence for pulsations was found. Our results favour
the hypothesis that Calvera is a normal rotation-powered pulsar, with the only
peculiarity of being born at a large height above the Galactic disk.

recursively adjusted on the sampling time, and its updating strategy does not
depend on the switching in a sampling interval. In other words, the explicit
value of the switching signal in a sampling interval is not necessary. The
numerically testable condition is developed to ensure almost sure exponential
stabilization of MJLSs under the proposed communication and control protocols.
We also drop the assumption of stabilizability of all individual modes required
in previous works about the switched systems. Moreover, we extend the result to
the case of continuous-time semi-Markov jump linear systems (semi-MJLSs) via
the semi-Markov kernel approach. Finally, some numerical examples are presented

now seem as ""old"" ones, they keep their significance as fundamentally important
results in the theory of nonlinear DW and QP patterns. Adding to the findings
revealed in the original works by M. I. Tribelsky et al., the present article
also reports several new analytical results, recently obtained as exact
solutions to systems of coupled real Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations. These are:
a new solution for symmetric DWs in the bimodal system including linear mixing
between its components; a solution for a strongly asymmetric DWs in the case
when the diffusion (second-derivative) term is present only in one GL equation;
a solution for a system of three real GL equations, for the symmetric DW with a
trapped bright soliton in the third component; and an exact solution for DWs
between counter-propagating waves governed by the GL equations with
group-velocity terms. The significance to the ""old"" and new results collected

completely unseen data collected throughout the first quarter of 2021. Using
only a binary predictor, at the end of our three-month trading period, our
models showed an average profit of 86\%, matching the results of the more
traditional buy-and-hold strategy. However, after incorporating a risk
tolerance score into our trading strategy by utilising the model's prediction
confidence scores, our models were 12.5\% more profitable than the simple

for many devices to accomplish local training and upload weights to the edge

divided into several sub-models with different depths and output prediction
from the exit in the corresponding sub-model. In this way, the devices with
insufficient computational power can choose the earlier exits and avoid
training the complete model, which can help reduce computational latency and
enable devices to participate into aggregation as much as possible within a

and bandwidth allocation algorithm to maximize the total number of exits in
each communication round. Simulation experiments are conducted on the classical

high variance of data that comes from different domains tends to severely
degrade system performance over cross-site or cross-modality datasets. To
mitigate this problem, a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method
named dispensed Transformer network (DTNet) is introduced in this paper. Our
novel DTNet contains three modules. First, a dispensed residual transformer
block is designed, which realizes global attention by dispensed interleaving
operation and deals with the excessive computational cost and GPU memory usage
of the Transformer. Second, a multi-scale consistency regularization is
proposed to alleviate the loss of details in the low-resolution output for
better feature alignment. Finally, a feature ranking discriminator is
introduced to automatically assign different weights to domain-gap features to
lessen the feature distribution distance, reducing the performance shift of two
domains. The proposed method is evaluated on large fluorescein angiography (FA)

physics. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are neural networks that are able to
represent the essential information of a high dimensional data set in a low
dimensional latent space, which have a probabilistic interpretation. In
particular the so-called encoder network, the first part of the VAE, which maps
its input onto a position in latent space, additionally provides uncertainty
information in terms of a variance around this position. In this work, an
extension to the Autoencoder architecture is introduced, the FisherNet. In this
architecture, the latent space uncertainty is not generated using an additional
information channel in the encoder, but derived from the decoder, by means of
the Fisher information metric. This architecture has advantages from a
theoretical point of view as it provides a direct uncertainty quantification
derived from the model, and also accounts for uncertainty cross-correlations.

reconstructions than a comparable VAE and its learning performance also

estimate the total weight $W=\sum_{a\in U} w(a)$ to within factor of
$1\pm\varepsilon$ with some constant probability $>1/2$. Since $n=|U|$ is
large, we want to do this without looking at the entire set $U$. In the
traditional setting in which we are allowed to sample elements from $U$
uniformly, sampling $\Omega(n)$ items is necessary to provide any non-trivial
guarantee on the estimate. Therefore, we investigate this problem in different
settings: in the \emph{proportional} setting we can sample items with
probabilities proportional to their weights, and in the \emph{hybrid} setting
we can sample both proportionally and uniformly. These settings have
applications, for example, in sublinear-time algorithms and distribution
testing.
  Sum estimation in the proportional and hybrid setting has been considered
before by Motwani, Panigrahy, and Xu [ICALP, 2007]. In their paper, they give
both upper and lower bounds in terms of $n$. Their bounds are near-matching in
terms of $n$, but not in terms of $\varepsilon$. In this paper, we improve both
their upper and lower bounds. Our bounds are matching up to constant factors in
both settings, in terms of both $n$ and $\varepsilon$. No lower bounds with
dependency on $\varepsilon$ were known previously. In the proportional setting,
we improve their $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^{7/2})$ algorithm to
$O(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)$. In the hybrid setting, we improve
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt[3]{n}/ \varepsilon^{9/2})$ to
$O(\sqrt[3]{n}/\varepsilon^{4/3})$. Our algorithms are also significantly
simpler and do not have large constant factors. We also investigate the
previously unexplored setting where $n$ is unknown to the algorithm. Finally,
we show how our techniques apply to the problem of edge counting in graphs.

deviation from their average behaviour, such as earthquakes or power blackouts.
Such extreme events occurring on the nodes of a complex network have been
extensively studied earlier through the modelling framework of unbiased random
walks. They reveal that the occurrence probability for extreme events on nodes
of a network has a strong dependence on the nodal properties. Apart from these,
a recent work has shown the independence of extreme events on edges from those
occurring on nodes. Hence, in this work, we propose a more general formalism to
study the properties of extreme events arising from biased random walkers on
the edges of a network. This formalism is applied to biases based on a variety
network centrality measures including PageRank. It is shown that with biased
random walkers as the dynamics on the network, extreme event probabilities
depend on the local properties of the edges. The probabilities are highly
variable for some edges of the network, while they are approximately a constant
for some other edges on the same network. This feature is robust with respect
to different biases applied to the random walk algorithm. Further, using
results from this formalism, it is shown that a network is far more robust to
extreme events occurring on edges when compared to those occurring on the
nodes.

with XGBoost, CatBoost and Random forest. One scheme (namely one-step model) is
to predict photometric redshifts directly based on the optimal models created
by these three algorithms; the other scheme (namely two-step model) is to
firstly classify the data into low- and high- redshift datasets, and then
predict photometric redshifts of these two datasets separately. For one-step
model, the performance of these three algorithms on photometric redshift
estimation is compared with different training samples, and CatBoost is
superior to XGBoost and Random forest. For two-step model, the performance of
these three algorithms on the classification of low- and high-redshift
subsamples are compared, and CatBoost still shows the best performance.
Therefore CatBoost is regard as the core algorithm of classification and
regression in two-step model. By contrast with one-step model, two-step model
is optimal when predicting photometric redshift of quasars, especially for high
redshift quasars. Finally the two models are applied to predict photometric
redshifts of all quasar candidates of BASS DR3. The number of high redshift
quasar candidates is 3938 (redshift $\ge 3.5$) and 121 (redshift $\ge 4.5$) by

automatically detect certain types of information in documents in various
application domains, they provide limited support to help regulators
automatically identify the text chunks related to financial information types,
due to the complexity of financial documents and the diversity of the sentences
characterizing an information type. In this paper, we propose FITI, an
artificial intelligence (AI)-based method for tracing content requirements in
financial documents. Given a new financial document, FITI selects a set of
candidate sentences for efficient information type identification. Then, FITI
uses a combination of rule-based and data-centric approaches, by leveraging
information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML) techniques that analyze
the words, sentences, and contexts related to an information type, to rank
candidate sentences. Finally, using a list of indicator phrases related to each
information type, a heuristic-based selector, which considers both the sentence
ranking and the domain-specific phrases, determines a list of sentences
corresponding to each information type. We evaluated FITI by assessing its
effectiveness in tracing financial content requirements in 100 financial

with average precision and recall values of 0.824 and 0.646, respectively.

for physical document digitization. However, such digitized documents are often
distorted due to uncontrolled physical deformations, camera positions, and

for document image rectification. Different from existing solutions, DocScanner
addresses this issue by introducing a progressive learning mechanism.
Specifically, DocScanner maintains a single estimate of the rectified image,
which is progressively corrected with a recurrent architecture. The iterative
refinements make DocScanner converge to a robust and superior rectification
performance, while the lightweight recurrent architecture ensures the running
efficiency. To further improve the rectification quality, based on the
geometric priori between the distorted and the rectified images, a geometric
regularization is introduced during training to further improve the
performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Doc3D dataset and the
DocUNet Benchmark dataset, and the quantitative and qualitative evaluation
results verify the effectiveness of DocScanner, which outperforms previous
methods on OCR accuracy, image similarity, and our proposed distortion metric
by a considerable margin. Furthermore, our DocScanner shows superior efficiency
in runtime latency and model size.

reflectance have been found on the near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu. Based on
their visible wavelength spectral differences, Tatsumi et al. (2021) defined
two bright boulder classes: C-type and S-type. These two classifications of
bright boulders have different size distributions and spectral trends. In this
study, we measured the spectra of 79 bright boulders and investigated their
detailed spectral properties. Analyses obtained a number of important results.
First, S-type bright boulders on Ryugu have spectra that are similar to those
found for two different ordinary chondrites with different initial spectra that
have been experimentally space weathered the same way. This suggests that there
may be two populations of S-type bright boulders on Ryugu, perhaps originating
from two different impactors that hit its parent body. Second, the model
space-weathering ages of meter-size S-type bright boulders, based on spectral
change rates derived in previous experimentally irradiated ordinary chondrites,
are 0.1-1 Myr, which is consistent with the crater retention age (<Myr) of the
~1-m deep surface layer on Ryugu. This agreement strongly suggests that the
Ryugu surface is extremely young, implying that the samples acquired from the
Ryugu surface should be fresh. Third, the lack of a serpentine absorption in
the S-type clast embedded in one of the large brecciated boulders indicates
that fragmentation and cementation that created the breccias occurred after the
termination of aqueous alteration. Fourth, C-type bright boulders exhibit a
continuous spectral trend similar to the heating track of low-albedo
carbonaceous chondrites, such as CM and CI. Other processes, such as space
weathering and grain size effects, cannot primarily account for their spectral
variation.

an inverse problem. The inverse problem is usually solved using time-consuming
iterative algorithms with sparsity or other constraints. Recently, deep neural
network (DNN)-based methods have been developed to accelerate the
inverse-problem-solving process. However, these methods typically adopt
supervised learning scheme, which requires ground truths, or labels of the
solutions, for training. In many applications, it would be challenging or even
impossible to obtain the ground truth, such as the tissue reflectivity function
in ultrasound beamforming. In this study, a general framework based on
self-supervised learning (SSL) scheme is proposed to train a DNN to solve the
inverse problems. In this way, the measurements can be used as both the inputs
and the labels during the training of DNN. The proposed SSL method is applied
to four typical linear inverse problems for validation, i.e., plane wave
ultrasound and photoacoustic image reconstructions, compressed sensing-based
synthetic transmit aperture dataset recovery and deconvolution in ultrasound
localization microscopy. Results show that, using the proposed framework, the
trained DNN can achieve improved reconstruction accuracy with reduced
computational time, compared with conventional methods.

network scale, networks are massive, changing rapidly and could naturally be

graph streams, existing non-streaming community detection methods are no longer
applicable. This raises an emerging need for online approaches. In this work,
we consider the problem of uncovering the local community containing a few
query nodes in graph streams, termed streaming local community detection. This
is a new problem raised recently that is more challenging for community
detection and only a few works address this online setting. Correspondingly, we
design an online single-pass streaming local community detection approach.
Inspired by the ""local"" property of communities, our method samples the local
structure around the query nodes in graph streams, and extracts the target
community on the sampled subgraph using our proposed metric called the

remarkably outperforms the streaming baseline on both effectiveness and

and a very low average normal albedo of 0.04. Although the majority of boulders
on Ryugu have reflectance spectra and albedo similar to the Ryugu average, a
small fraction of boulders exhibit anomalously high albedo and distinctively
different spectra. A previous study (Tatsumi et al., 2021) based on the 2.7-km
observations and a series of low-altitude (down to 68 m) descent observations
conducted prior to the first touchdown have shown that the spectra of these
anomalous boulders can be classified into two distinct groups corresponding to
S and C type asteroids. The former originate most likely from an impactor that
collided with Ryugu's parent body, whereas the latter may be from portions of
Ryugu's parent body that experienced a different temperature history than
experienced by the majority of boulder materials. In this study, we analyzed
images captured after the first touchdown to determine the quantitative
properties of these bright boulders on Ryugu. We measured the sizes of more
than a thousand bright boulders and characterized the morphologic properties of
the largest ones. Analyses revealed many properties of bright boulders
important for the evolution of Ryugu and its parent body. The size-frequency
distributions of S- and C-type bright boulders follow power laws. We obtained
the ratios of the total volume and surface area of S-type bright boulders to
those of average dark boulders on the Ryugu surface. Also, many of the bright
boulders are embedded in a larger substrate boulder, suggesting that they have
experienced mixing and conglomeration with darker fragments on the parent body,
rather than gently landing on Ryugu during or after its formation by
reaccumulation. This is consistent with the hypothesis that S-type bright
boulders were likely mixed during and/or before a catastrophic disruption.

broadband spectral states in three observations, the X-ray spectrum is found to
be the hardest during 2018, while the high-energy-end of the simultaneous
optical-FUV spectrum shows a steepening that is modeled with a broken power-law
spectrum. The spectral energy distribution (SED) in 2017 shows a relatively
flatter optical-FUV and soft X-ray spectra, implying an additional emission
component. The 2020 optical-FUV spectrum is harder than in 2017 and 2018, with
an extremely soft X-ray spectrum and a hardening above $\sim$1 GeV, similar to
the SEDs of High-energy-peaked BL Lac objects (HBL), thereby establishing that

potential to revolutionize various businesses and industries. However, the
adoption of UAV-assisted applications will strongly rely on the provision of
reliable systems that allow managing UAV operations at high levels of safety

introduced to support safe, efficient, and fair access to low-altitude airspace
for commercial UAVs. A UTM system identifies multiple cooperating parties with
different roles and levels of authority to provide real-time services to
airspace users. However, current UTM systems are centralized and lack a clear
definition of protocols that govern a secure interaction between authorities,
service providers, and end-users. The lack of such protocols renders the UTM
system unscalable and prone to various cyber attacks. Another limitation of the
currently proposed UTM architecture is the absence of an efficient mechanism to
enforce airspace rules and regulations. To address this issue, we propose a
decentralized UTM protocol that controls access to airspace while ensuring high
levels of integrity, availability, and confidentiality of airspace operations.

technologies. In addition, we employ a mobile crowdsensing (MCS) mechanism to
seamlessly enforce airspace rules and regulations that govern the UAV
operations. The solution is implemented on top of the Etheruem platform and
verified using four different smart contract verification tools. We also

hosts 2 focal planes and a total number of 4000 Kinetic Inductance Detectors
(KID), with an instantaneous FoV of 18.6 arcminutes in the range of 130-310
GHz. The spectral resolution can be easily tuned down to 1 GHz depending on the
scientific target. The scientific program of CONCERTO has many objectives, with
two main programs focused on mapping the fluctuations of the [CII] line
intensity in the reionisation and post-reionisation epoch (4.5<z<8.5), and on
studying galaxy clusters via the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)
effect. CONCERTO will also measure the dust and molecular gas contents of local
and intermediate-redshift galaxies, it will study the Galactic star-forming
clouds and finally it will observe the CO intensity fluctuations arising from
0.3<z<2 galaxies. The design of the instrument, installation at APEX and

Furthermore, multimodal cost functions render local gradient-based search
techniques ineffective. To overcome these difficulties, we propose to trim
uninteresting regions of the search space where global optima are unlikely to
be found by means of autoencoders, exploiting the lower intrinsic
dimensionality of certain cost functions; optima are then searched over
lower-dimensional latent spaces. The methodology is tested on benchmark

Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS). We use the H$z$RG criteria that a radio
source is undetected in all-sky optical and infrared catalogues, and has a very
steep radio spectrum. We cross-match the radio catalogue against
multi-wavelength galaxy catalogues from DECaLS and AllWISE. For those radio
sources with no multi-wavelength counterpart, we further implement a radio
spectral index criterium of $\alpha < -1$, using in-band spectral index
measurements from the wide-band MeerKAT data. Using a 5$\sigma$ signal-to-noise
cut on the radio flux densities, we find a total of 274 HzRG candidates: 179
ultra-steep spectrum sources, and 95 potential candidates which cannot be ruled
out as they have no spectral information available. The spectral index
assignments in this work are complete above a flux density of 0.3 mJy, at least
an order of magnitude lower than existing studies in this frequency range or
when extrapolating from lower frequency limits. Our faintest HzRG candidates
with and without an in-band spectral index measurement have a 1.28\,GHz flux
density of 57 $\pm$ 8 $\mu$Jy and 68 $\pm$ 13 $\mu$Jy, respectively. Although
our study is not complete down to these flux densities, our results indicate
that the sensitivity and bandwidth of the MGCLS data makes them a powerful
radio resource to search for H$z$RG candidates in the Southern sky, with 20 of
the MGCLS pointings having similar image quality as the Abell~2751 field and

key challenge in high-contrast imaging. Speckles are due to a combination of
fast, slow and static wavefront aberrations introduced by atmospheric
turbulence and instrument optics. While wavefront control techniques developed
over the last decade have shown promise in minimizing fast atmospheric
residuals, slow and static aberrations such as non-common path aberrations
(NCPAs) remain a key limiting factor for exoplanet detection. NCPA are not seen
by the wavefront sensor (WFS) of the adaptive optics (AO) loop, hence the
difficulty in correcting them. We propose to improve the identification and
rejection of those aberrations. The algorithm DrWHO, performs frequent
compensation of static and quasi-static aberrations to boost image contrast. By
changing the WFS reference at every iteration of the algorithm, DrWHO changes
the AO point of convergence to lead it towards a compensation of the static and
slow aberrations. References are calculated using an iterative lucky-imaging
approach, where each iteration updates the WFS reference, ultimately favoring
high-quality focal plane images. We validate this concept through numerical
simulations and on-sky testing on the SCExAO instrument at the 8.2-m Subaru
telescope. Simulations show a rapid convergence towards the correction of 82%
of the NCPAs. On-sky tests are performed over a 10-minute run in the visible
(750 nm). We introduce a flux concentration (FC) metric to quantify the point
spread function (PSF) quality and measure a 15.7% improvement. The DrWHO
algorithm is a robust focal-plane wavefront sensing calibration method that has
been successfully demonstrated on sky. It does not rely on a model nor requires
wavefront sensor calibration or linearity. It is compatible with different
wavefront control methods, and can be further optimized for speed and
efficiency.

results, recent approaches are not yet flexible enough to be applicable to

that ensure the naturality of the emergent locomotion gaits but prevent
generalization. This work proposes a generic approach for ensuring realism in
locomotion by guiding the learning process with the spring-loaded inverted

Reinforcement Learning (RL), we learn a control policy that fills in the
information gap between the template model and full-body dynamics required to
maintain stable and periodic locomotion. The proposed approach can be applied
to robots of different sizes and morphologies and adapted to any RL technique
and control architecture. We present experimental results showing that even in
a model-free setup and with a simple reactive control architecture, the learned
policies can generate realistic and energy-efficient locomotion gaits for a
bipedal and a quadrupedal robot. And most importantly, this is achieved without
using motion capture, strong constraints in the dynamics or kinematics of the
robot, nor prescribing limb coordination. We provide supplemental videos for
qualitative analysis of the naturality of the learned gaits.

photons coupled to photonic integrated circuits is key for quantum photonic
applications. Nevertheless, high indistinguishability (I) at RT is difficult to
obtain due to the intrinsic dephasing of most deterministic single-photon
sources (SPS). Here we present a numerical demonstration of the design and
optimization of a hybrid slot-Bragg nanophotonic cavity that achieves
theoretical near-unity I and high coupling efficiency (\b{eta}) at RT for a
variety of singlephoton emitters. Our numerical simulations predict modal
volumes in the order of 10-3 ({\lambda}/2n)3 , allowing for strong coupling of
quantum photonic emitters that can be heterogeneously integrated. We show that
high I and \b{eta} should be possible by fine-tuning the quality factor (Q)
depending on the intrinsic properties of the single-photon emitter.
Furthermore, we perform a machine learning optimization based on the
combination of a deep neural network and a genetic algorithm (GA) to further
decrease the modal volume by almost three times while relaxing the tight
dimensions of the slot width required for strong coupling. The optimized device
has a slot width of 20 nm. The design requires fabrication resolution in the
limit of the current state-ofthe-art technology. Also, the condition for high I
and \b{eta} requires a positioning accuracy of the quantum emitter at the
nanometer level. Although the proposal is not a scalable technology, it can be
suitable for experimental demonstration of single photon operation

against saving propensity $\lambda$ in a closed economy, using the Kinetic
theory. We estimate the Gini ($g$) and Kolkata ($k)$ indices by deriving (using
$P(x)$) the Lorenz function $L(f)$, giving the cumulative fraction $L$ of
wealth possessed by fraction $f$ of the people ordered in ascending order of
wealth. First, using the exact result for $P(x)$ when $\lambda = 0$ we derive
$L(f)$, and from there the index values $g$ and $k$. We then proceed with an
approximate gamma distribution form of $P(x)$ for non-zero values of $\lambda$.
Then we derive the results for $g$ and $k$ at $\lambda = 0.25$ and as $\lambda
\rightarrow 1$. We note that for $\lambda \rightarrow 1$ the wealth
distribution $P(x)$ becomes a Dirac $\delta$-function. Using this and assuming
that form for larger values of $\lambda$ we proceed for an approximate estimate
for $P(x)$ centered around the most probable wealth (a function of $\lambda$).
We utilize this approximate form to evaluate $L(f)$, and using this along with
the known analytical expression for $g$, we derive an analytical expression for
$k(\lambda)$. These analytical results for $g$ and $k$ at different $\lambda$
are compared with numerical (Monte Carlo) results from the study of the
Chakraborti-Chakrabarti model. Next we derive analytically a relation between
$g$ and $k$. From the analytical expressions of $g$ and $k$, we proceed for a

time, video games have been developed and distributed for the purpose of

in the characteristics of games and how they can be used for different
purposes. Video games allow a tight loop of action-reaction which provides
fertile ground for many types of experiments which would be impossible or
prohibitively difficult to perform in the physical world, and as such serve as
strong virtual alternatives. A video game that is able to produce an immersive
experience for the player in which the player believes that they are ""actually

alternate way to explore human behaviors and decision-making processes.
Prospect theory questionnaires explore decision-making in hypothetical
situations. In most cases, these experiments are done in controlled
environments and rely on the respondent's imagination to reproduce the
situation which is presented to them. Creating a virtual world with which the
players can directly interact with and face tangible consequences of their
decisions brings the hypothetical situations of the prospect theory questions
closer to the respondent. If the players can interact with and manipulate the
virtual world, then it is much easier for them to empathize with it and their
character, and thus, the assumption is that the answers represent a more
realistic image of the player's decision making.

in a fair toss of a coin. In other words, there is no distinction between

statistical modelling. As demanded, for example, by the late Dennis Lindley,
since Bayesian probability is axiomatic, it is the non-Bayesians' duty to point
out which axioms are not acceptable to them. This is not a simple request,

such as video surveillance, social robot navigation, and autonomous driving,
and significant progress has been made in this research topic. However, there
remain two limitations of previous studies. First, with the continuation of
time, the prediction error at each time step increases significantly, causing
the final displacement error to be impossible to ignore. Second, the prediction
results of multiple pedestrians might be impractical in the prediction horizon,
i.e., the predicted trajectories might collide with each other. To overcome
these limitations, this work proposes a novel trajectory prediction method
called CSR, which consists of a cascaded conditional variational autoencoder
(CVAE) module and a socially-aware regression module. The cascaded CVAE module
first estimates the future trajectories in a sequential pattern. Specifically,
each CVAE concatenates the past trajectories and the predicted points so far as
the input and predicts the location at the following time step. Then, the
socially-aware regression module generates offsets from the estimated future
trajectories to produce the socially compliant final predictions, which are
more reasonable and accurate results than the estimated trajectories. Moreover,
considering the large model parameters of the cascaded CVAE module, a slide
CVAE module is further exploited to improve the model efficiency using one
shared CVAE, in a slidable manner. Experiments results demonstrate that the
proposed method exhibits improvements over state-of-the-art method on the
Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) and ETH/UCY of approximately 38.0% and 22.2%,

However, their performance suffers critical drops when they are subsequently
trained on novel classes without any sample from the base classes originally
used to train the model. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting.
Recently, several incremental learning methods are proposed to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting for object detection. Despite the effectiveness, these
methods require co-occurrence of the unlabeled base classes in the training
data of the novel classes. This requirement is impractical in many real-world
settings since the base classes do not necessarily co-occur with the novel
classes. In view of this limitation, we consider a more practical setting of
complete absence of co-occurrence of the base and novel classes for the object
detection task. We propose the use of unlabeled in-the-wild data to bridge the
non co-occurrence caused by the missing base classes during the training of
additional novel classes. To this end, we introduce a blind sampling strategy
based on the responses of the base-class model and pre-trained novel-class
model to select a smaller relevant dataset from the large in-the-wild dataset
for incremental learning. We then design a dual-teacher distillation framework
to transfer the knowledge distilled from the base- and novel-class teacher
models to the student model using the sampled in-the-wild data. Experimental
results on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that our proposed method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art class-incremental object
detection methods when there is no co-occurrence between the base and novel
classes during training.

March and April 2020 most of the studied area is characterized by negative
relative changes (median values around -25%), with the exception of the first
week of March and the fourth week of April (median values around 5%). As these
changes cannot be attributed to a weather effect, it is likely that they are a
byproduct of the lockdown measures.

explicitly defined in the canonical sectors. In the heavy-dense limit, the
fermionic contributions to the canonical partition functions in terms of
Polyakov loops and quark occupation numbers turn out to be completely
factorized in space. At low temperatures and infinitely strong coupling the
sign problem is reduced by orders of magnitude for any baryon number as
compared to the corresponding grand-canonical ensemble. In the canonical
formulation it is straighforward to integrate out the Polyakov loops in the
fermionic weights yielding the partition function as a sum of only baryon
occupation numbers in which the sign problem is absent. Using an effective form
of the gauge action valid for small values of the gauge coupling, the same can
be achieved away from the strong coupling limit in terms of quark occupation
numbers and fluxes which couple the quarks with each other. The emerging
clusters suggest the construction of algorithms which circumvent the sign
problem in the heavy-dense limit including the full gauge action for any value
of the gauge coupling.

years, but some severe challenges remain open, like distractors and occlusions.
We suspect the reason is that the feature representations of the tracking

In this paper, we propose a novel Instance-Aware Tracker (IAT) to explicitly
excavate the discriminability of feature representations, which improves the
classical visual tracking pipeline with an instance-level classifier. First, we
introduce a contrastive learning mechanism to formulate the classification
task, ensuring that every training sample could be uniquely modeled and be
highly distinguishable from plenty of other samples. Besides, we design an
effective negative sample selection scheme to contain various intra and inter
classes in the instance classification branch. Furthermore, we implement two
variants of the proposed IAT, including a video-level one and an object-level
one. They realize the concept of \textbf{instance} in different granularity as
videos and target bounding boxes, respectively. The former enhances the ability
to recognize the target from the background while the latter boosts the
discriminative power for mitigating the target-distractor dilemma. Extensive
experimental evaluations on 8 benchmark datasets show that both two versions of
the proposed IAT achieve leading results against state-of-the-art methods while
running at 30FPS. Code will be available when it is published.

Almost all the existing works are required to load the whole training data into

architectures (e.g., ResNet), leading to the limited representation abilities
of the models. In this paper, we propose a new deep subspace clustering
framework, motivated by the energy-based models. In contrast to previous
approaches taking the weights of a fully connected layer as the self-expressive
coefficients, we propose to learn an energy-based network to obtain the
self-expressive coefficients by mini-batch training. By this means, it is no
longer necessary to load all data into one batch for learning, and it thus
becomes a reality that we can utilize deeper neural network models for subspace
clustering. Considering the powerful representation ability of the recently
popular self-supervised learning, we attempt to leverage self-supervised

are performed on three publicly available datasets, and extensive experimental

Ge under the influence of electric and magnetic fields applied perpendicularly
to the device. In our theoretical description, we include these effects
exactly. The orbital effects lead to a strong renormalization of the g-factor.
We find a sweet-spot of the nanowire (NW) g-factor where charge noise is
strongly suppressed and present an effective low-energy model that captures the

properties of NWs with square and circular cross-sections with ones of

Interestingly, the effective model predicts a flat band ground state for
fine-tuned electric and magnetic fields. By considering a quantum dot (QD)
harmonically confined by gates, we demonstrate that the NW g-factor sweet spot
is retained in the QD. Our calculations reveal that this sweet spot can be
designed to coincide with the maximum of the SOI, yielding highly coherent
qubits with large Rabi frequencies. We also study the effective g-factor of NWs
grown along different high symmetry axes and find that our model derived for
isotropic semiconductors is valid for the most relevant growth directions of
non-isotropic Ge NWs. Moreover, a NW grown along one of the three main

absorber (BNA) by controlling the presence or absence of water. The
liquid-based absorber is firstly analyzed by a multimode dielectric resonant
circuit and the fundamental operating principle of the FSR is demonstrated with
the help of an equivalent circuit model (ECM). A design example is provided,
fabricated, and measured and it exhibits a passband at 5.10 GHz with a
transmission bandwidth of 18.5% for less than 3 dB insertion loss and
fractional bandwidth of 146.8% with reflectivity less than -10 dB in FSR mode.
In BNA mode, it has a minimum return loss of 0.72 dB and a good absorption band
from 2.5 to 4.6 GHz and 5.7 to 16.5 GHz. Good agreements among circuit
analysis, simulation results, and measurement results are finally obtained. The
switchable rasorber can be applied in a shared-aperture antennas system to
convert a broadband stealth radome into a BNA.

populating photons via a gain medium. Here, we introduce the transient loss
boundary into a photon populated cavity that functions as a photon brake and
probe photon dynamics by engineering the brake timing and brake strength.
Coupled cavity photons can be distinguished by stripping one photonic mode
through controlling the loss boundary, which enables the transition from a
coupled to an uncoupled state. We interpret the transient boundary as a
perturbation by considering both real and imaginary parts of permittivity, and
the dynamic process is modelled with a temporal two-dipole oscillator, one with
the natural resonant polarization and the other with a frequency-shift
polarization. The model unravels the underlying mechanism of concomitant
coherent spectral oscillations and generation of tone-tuning cavity photons in
the braking process. By synthesizing the temporal loss boundary into a photon

envisioned such as the observation of quantum squeezed states, low-loss
nonreciprocal waveguides and ultrafast beam scanning devices.

The actual sampling for large TD error is performed in two steps: first, an

its experiences, and then, for the sampled episode, the hindsight goal leading
to larger TD error is sampled with higher probability from future visited

section (RCS). The antenna system is formed by combining a liquid absorber with
a 2*2 slot antenna array. The liquid absorber consists of a polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) container, a 45% ethanol layer, and a metal ground,which is
attached to the surface of the slot antenna array. The incident wave can be
absorbed by the absorber rather than reflected in other directions when the
PMMA container is filled with ethanol, which reduces the monostatic and
bistatic RCS. Thus the RCS of the antenna can be changed by injecting and
extracting ethanol while the antenna's radiation performance in terms of
bandwidth, radiation patterns and gain is well sustained. In a complex
communication system, this can be used to switch between detection and stealth
mode. The mechanism of the absorber is investigated. The simulated results show
that the antenna with this absorber has monostatic and bistatic RCS reduction
bands from 2.0 GHz to 18.0 GHz, a maximum RCS reduction of 35 dB with an
average RCS reduction of 13.28 dB. The antenna's operating band is 100 MHz.
Without ethanol, the antenna has a realized gain of 12.1 dBi, and it drops by 2
dB when the lossy ethanol is injected. The measured results agree well with the

canonical ensemble of organisms (population), the corresponding partition
function (macroscopic counterpart of fitness) and free energy (macroscopic
counterpart of additive fitness). We further define the biological counterparts
of temperature (biological temperature) as the measure of stochasticity of the
evolutionary process and of chemical potential (evolutionary potential) as the
amount of evolutionary work required to add a new trainable variable (such as
an additional gene) to the evolving system. We then develop a phenomenological
approach to the description of evolution, which involves modeling the grand
potential as a function of the biological temperature and evolutionary
potential. We demonstrate how this phenomenological approach can be used to
study the ""ideal mutation"" model of evolution and its generalizations. Finally,
we show that, within this thermodynamics framework, major transitions in
evolution, such as the transition from an ensemble of molecules to an ensemble
of organisms, that is, the origin of life, can be modeled as a special case of
bona fide physical phase transitions that are associated with the emergence of

this parameter is unknown and, hence, the optimal MMD test with this particular

called MMDAgg, which is adaptive to the smoothness parameter. The test power is
maximised over the collection of kernels used, without requiring held-out data

kernel choices such as the median heuristic. We prove that MMDAgg still
controls the level non-asymptotically, and achieves the minimax rate over

restricted to a specific type of kernel, but hold for any product of
one-dimensional translation invariant characteristic kernels. We provide a

Machine learning systems have been developed to aid this procedure generally

SpineOne is built upon the following three key techniques: 1) a new design of

$n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ time algorithms for a family of graph modification problems
that includes problems that can be seen as generalized cycle hitting problems.
  Our starting point is the Node Unique Label Cover problem (that is, given a
CSP instance where each constraint is a permutation of values on two variables,
the task is to delete $k$ variables to make the instance satisfiable). We
introduce a variant of the problem where $k$ vertices have to be deleted such
that every 2-connected component of the remaining instance is satisfiable. Then
we extend the problem with cardinality constraints that restrict the number of
times a certain value can be used (globally or within a 2-connected component
of the solution). We show that there is an $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ time algorithm on
planar graphs for any problem that can be formulated this way, which includes a
large number of well-studied problems, for example, Odd Cycle Transversal,
Subset Feedback Vertex Set, Group Feedback Vertex Set, Subset Group Feedback
Vertex Set, Vertex Multiway Cut, and Component Order Connectivity.
  For those problems that admit appropriate (quasi)polynomial kernels (that
increase the parameter only linearly and preserve planarity), our results
immediately imply $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\cdot\operatorname{polylog}(k))}n^{O(1)}$ time
parameterized algorithms on planar graphs. In particular, we use or adapt known
kernelization results to obtain $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\cdot \operatorname{polylog}(k))}
n^{O(1)}$ time (randomized) algorithms for Vertex Multiway Cut, Group Feedback
Vertex Set, and Subset Feedback Vertex Set.

decades in almost every area, being the commercial and scientific fields the
most notorious ones. Concerning particle physics, ML has been proved as a
useful resource to make the most of projects such as the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC). The main advantage provided by ML is reducing the time and effort put
into the measurements done by experiments, while improving the performance.
With this work we aim to encourage scientists at particle colliders to use ML
and to try the different alternatives we have available nowadays, focusing in
the separation between signal and background. We assess some of the most used
libraries in the field, like Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis with ROOT,
and also newer and more sophisticated options like PyTorch and Keras. We also
check how optimal are some of the most common algorithms for signal-background
discrimination, such as Boosted Decision Trees, and propose the use of others,
namely Neural Networks. We compare the overall performance of different
algorithms and libraries in simulated LHC data and produce some guidelines to
help analysts deal with different situations. Examples are the use of low or
high-level features from particle detectors or the amount of statistics
available for training the algorithms.

fusion, laser plasma instabilities (LPIs) remain to be an inevitable problem
for current drive schemes. To mitigate these instabilities, significant efforts
have been paid to produce high-power broadband ultraviolet lasers. However, no
practical scheme has been demonstrated up to now for efficient triple-frequency
conversion of broadband laser. Here we propose the design of polychromatic
drivers for the generation of multicolor beams mainly based upon the optical
parametric amplification, which can significantly enhance the third-harmonic
conversion efficiency. Each polychromatic light has four colors of
monochromatic beamlets with a full spectrum width of 3\%, and the beamlet
colors of any two adjacent flanges are different. The suppression effects of
such polychromatic lights have been investigated via large scale
particle-in-cell simulations, which indicate that more than 35\% of the
incident energy can be saved from the LPIs compared with monochromatic lasers
for the direct-drive scheme, or high-density filled target for the
indirect-drive scheme. The proposed polychromatic drivers are based on the
matured technologies, and thus may pave the way towards realization of robust

straightforwardly implemented in the forward problem without computational
overhead. However, 3D frequency-domain seismic modeling is challenging since it
requires solving a large and sparse linear indefinite system per frequency with
multiple right-hand sides. This linear system can be solved by direct or
iterative methods. The former are very efficient to process multiple right-hand
sides but may suffer from limited scalability for very large problems.
Iterative methods equipped with a domain decomposition preconditioner provide a
suitable alternative to process large computational domains for sparse node

been widely applied for recommendation, and achieved impressive performance
gains. The core of GCNs lies in its message passing mechanism to aggregate
neighborhood information. However, we observed that message passing largely
slows down the convergence of GCNs during training, especially for large-scale
recommender systems, which hinders their wide adoption. LightGCN makes an early
attempt to simplify GCNs for collaborative filtering by omitting feature
transformations and nonlinear activations. In this paper, we take one step
further to propose an ultra-simplified formulation of GCNs (dubbed UltraGCN),
which skips infinite layers of message passing for efficient recommendation.
Instead of explicit message passing, UltraGCN resorts to directly approximate
the limit of infinite-layer graph convolutions via a constraint loss.
Meanwhile, UltraGCN allows for more appropriate edge weight assignments and
flexible adjustment of the relative importances among different types of
relationships. This finally yields a simple yet effective UltraGCN model, which
is easy to implement and efficient to train. Experimental results on four
benchmark datasets show that UltraGCN not only outperforms the state-of-the-art

healthcare challenges: the dual high burden of communicable and
non-communicable diseases; a paucity of highly trained primary healthcare
providers in both rural and densely populated urban areas; and a lack of
reliable, inexpensive internet connections. Objective: To address these
challenges, we designed an artificial intelligence assistant to help primary
healthcare providers in lower-resource areas document demographic and medical
sign/symptom data and to record and share diagnostic data in real-time with a
centralized database. Design: We trained our system using multiple data sets,
including US-based electronic medical records (EMRs) and open-source medical
literature and developed an adaptive, general medical assistant system based on
machine learning algorithms. Main outcomes and Measure: The application
collects basic information from patients and provides primary care providers
with diagnoses and prescriptions suggestions. The application is unique from
existing systems in that it covers a wide range of common diseases, signs, and
medication typical in lower-resource countries; the application works with or
without an active internet connection. Results: We have built and implemented
an adaptive learning system that assists trained primary care professionals by
means of an Android smartphone application, which interacts with a central
database and collects real-time data. The application has been tested by dozens
of primary care providers. Conclusions and Relevance: Our application would
provide primary healthcare providers in lower-resource areas with a tool that
enables faster and more accurate documentation of medical encounters. This
application could be leveraged to automatically populate local or national EMR
systems.

much attention in recent years. While many domain adaptation techniques have
been proposed for images, the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation in
videos remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Contrast and
Mix (CoMix), a new contrastive learning framework that aims to learn
discriminative invariant feature representations for unsupervised video domain
adaptation. First, unlike existing methods that rely on adversarial learning
for feature alignment, we utilize temporal contrastive learning to bridge the
domain gap by maximizing the similarity between encoded representations of an
unlabeled video at two different speeds as well as minimizing the similarity
between different videos played at different speeds. Second, we propose a novel
extension to the temporal contrastive loss by using background mixing that
allows additional positives per anchor, thus adapting contrastive learning to
leverage action semantics shared across both domains. Moreover, we also
integrate a supervised contrastive learning objective using target
pseudo-labels to enhance discriminability of the latent space for video domain
adaptation. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods. Project

a finite subgroup of $SU(3)$. M-theory on this orbifold singularity gives rise
to a 5d SCFT, which is investigated with two methods. The first approach is via
3d McKay correspondence which relates the group theoretic data of $\Gamma$ to
the physical properties of the 5d SCFT. In particular, the 1-form symmetry of
the 5d SCFT is read off from the McKay quiver of $\Gamma$ in an elegant way.
The second method is to explicitly resolve the singularity $X$ and study the
Coulomb branch information of the 5d SCFT, which is applied to toric, non-toric
hypersurface and complete intersection cases. Many new theories are
constructed, either with or without an IR quiver gauge theory description. We
find that many resolved Calabi-Yau threefolds, $\widetilde{X}$, contain compact
exceptional divisors that are singular by themselves. Moreover, for certain
cases of $\Gamma$, the orbifold singularity $\mathbb{C}^3/\Gamma$ can be
embedded in an elliptic model and gives rise to a 6d (1,0) SCFT in the F-theory
construction. Such 6d theory is naturally related to the 5d SCFT defined on the

several independent variables to predict a dependent variable based on ground
truth (labeled) data, i.e., tuples of independent and dependent variables

a dependent variable. The dependent variable should preserve properties of the
independent variables, e.g., the ranking or relative distance of the
independent variable tuples, and/or represent a latent ground truth that is a
function of these independent variables. However, ground truth data is not
available for finding the aggregation model. Consequently, aggregation models
are data agnostic or can only be derived with unsupervised machine learning
approaches.
  We introduce a novel unsupervised aggregation approach based on intrinsic
properties of unlabeled training data, such as the cumulative probability
distributions of the single independent variables and their mutual
dependencies.
  We present an empirical evaluation framework that allows assessing the
proposed approach against other aggregation approaches from two perspectives:
(i) how well the aggregation output represents properties of the input tuples,
and (ii) how well can aggregated output predict a latent ground truth. To this
end, we use data sets for assessing supervised regression approaches that
contain explicit ground truth labels. However, the ground truth is not used for
deriving the aggregation models, but it allows for the assessment from a
perspective (ii). More specifically, we use regression data sets from the UCI
machine learning repository and benchmark several data-agnostic and
unsupervised approaches for aggregation against ours.
  The benchmark results indicate that our approach outperforms the other
data-agnostic and unsupervised aggregation approaches. It is almost on par with
linear regression.

real-world applications, this assumption is limiting -- to improve the problem
of lack of data in robotics, we would like to be able to leverage
demonstrations collected from agents with different dynamics. This can be
challenging as the demonstrations might not even be feasible for the imitator.
Our insight is that we can learn a feasibility metric that captures the
likelihood of a demonstration being feasible by the imitator. We develop a
feasibility MDP (f-MDP) and derive the feasibility score by learning an optimal
policy in the f-MDP. Our proposed feasibility measure encourages the imitator
to learn from more informative demonstrations, and disregard the far from
feasible demonstrations. Our experiments on four simulated environments and on

to assist routing in AANETs. We set out from the single objective of minimizing
the end-to-end (E2E) delay. Specifically, a deep neural network (DNN) is
conceived for mapping the local geographic information observed by the
forwarding node into the information required for determining the optimal next
hop. The DNN is trained by exploiting the regular mobility pattern of
commercial passenger airplanes from historical flight data. After training, the
DNN is stored by each airplane for assisting their routing decisions during
flight relying solely on local geographic information. Furthermore, we extend
the DL-aided routing algorithm to a multi-objective scenario, where we aim for
simultaneously minimizing the delay, maximizing the path capacity, and
maximizing the path lifetime. Our simulation results based on real flight data
show that the proposed DL-aided routing outperforms existing position-based
routing protocols in terms of its E2E delay, path capacity as well as path
lifetime, and it is capable of approaching the Pareto front that is obtained
using global link information.

Quantum walks have smaller hitting times compared to classical random walks on
certain types of graphs, leading to a quantum advantage of quantum-walks-based
algorithms. An important feature of quantum walks is that they are accompanied
by the excitation transfer from one site to another, and a moment of hitting
the destination site is characterized by the maximum probability amplitude of
observing the excitation on this site. It is therefore prospective to consider
such problems as candidates for quantum advantage demonstration, since gate
errors can smear out a peak in the transfer probability as a function of time,
nevertheless leaving it distinguishable. We investigate the influence of
quantum noise on hitting time and fidelity of a typical quantum walk problem -
a perfect state transfer (PST) over a qubit chain. We simulate dynamics of a
single excitation over the chain of qubits in the presence of typical noises of
a quantum processor (homogeneous and inhomogeneous Pauli noise, crosstalk
noise, thermal relaxation, and dephasing noise). We find that Pauli noise
mostly smears out a peak in the fidelity of excitation transfer, while
crosstalks between qubits mostly affect the hitting time. Knowledge about these
noise patterns allows us to propose an error mitigation procedure, which we use
to refine the results of running the PST on a simulator of a noisy quantum
processor.

inefficient, as it demands a large volume of memory for item and user contents

a sequence of $n$ clients appear in the metric space, and they need to be
eventually connected to some open facility. The clients do not have to be
connected immediately, but such a choice comes with a penalty: each client
incurs a waiting cost (the difference between its arrival and connection time).
At any point in time, an algorithm may decide to open a facility and connect
any subset of clients to it. This is a well-studied problem both of its own,
and within the general class of network design problems with delays.
  Our main focus is on a new variant of this problem, where clients may be
connected also to an already open facility, but such action incurs an extra
cost: an algorithm pays for waiting of the facility (a cost incurred separately
for each such ""late"" connection). This is reminiscent of online matching with
delays, where both sides of the connection incur a waiting cost. We call this
variant two-sided delay to differentiate it from the previously studied
one-sided delay.
  We present an $O(1)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for the two-sided
delay variant. On the technical side, we study a greedy strategy, which grows
budgets with increasing waiting delays and opens facilities for subsets of
clients once sums of these budgets reach certain thresholds. Our technique is a
substantial extension of the approach used by Jain, Mahdian and Saberi [STOC
2002] for analyzing the performance of offline algorithms for facility
location.
  We then show how to transform our $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for the
two-sided delay variant to $O(\log n / \log \log n)$-competitive deterministic
algorithm for one-sided delays. We note that all previous online algorithms for
problems with delays in general metrics have at least logarithmic ratios.

applications in datacenters. Prior solutions to the problem introduce
significant implementation complexities, such as global state monitoring,
complex network control, or non-trivial switch modifications. While promising
superior performance, they are hard to implement in practice. This paper
presents CloudBurst, a simple, effective yet readily deployable solution
achieving similar or even better results without introducing the above
complexities. At its core, CloudBurst explores forward error correction (FEC)
over multipath - it proactively spreads FEC-coded packets generated from
messages over multipath in parallel, and recovers them with the first few
arriving ones. As a result, CloudBurst is able to obliviously exploit
underutilized paths, thus achieving low tail latency. We have implemented
CloudBurst as a user-space library, and deployed it on a testbed with commodity
switches. Our testbed and simulation experiments show the superior performance
of CloudBurst. For example, CloudBurst achieves 63.69% and 60.06% reduction in

demographics of small, close-in exoplanets. Knowledge of how such planets
evolve allows one to ``rewind the clock'' to infer the conditions in which they
formed. Here, we explore the relationship between a planet's core mass and
their atmospheric mass after protoplanetary disc dispersal by exploiting XUV
photoevaporation as an evolutionary process. Historically, this style of
inference problem would be computationally infeasible due to the large number
of planet models required; however, we make use of a novel atmospheric
evolution emulator which utilises neural networks to provide three orders of
magnitude in speedup. First, we provide proof-of-concept for this emulator on a
real problem, by inferring the initial atmospheric conditions to the TOI-270
multi-planet system. Using the emulator we find near-indistinguishable results
when compared to original model. We then apply the emulator to the more complex
inference problem, which aims to find the initial conditions for a sample of
\textit{Kepler}, \textit{K2} and \textit{TESS} planets with well-constrained
masses and radii. We demonstrate there is a relationship between core masses
and the atmospheric mass that they retain after disc dispersal, and this trend
is consistent with the `boil-off' scenario, in which close-in planets undergo
dramatic atmospheric escape during disc dispersal. Thus, it appears the
exoplanet population is consistent with the idea that close-in exoplanets
initially acquired large massive atmospheres, the majority of which is lost
during disc dispersal; before the final population is sculpted by atmospheric
loss over 100~Myr to Gyr timescales.

navigation. Recent work has focused on addressing multimotion estimation in
highly dynamic environments. These environments not only comprise multiple,
complex motions but also tend to exhibit significant occlusion.
  Estimating third-party motions simultaneously with the sensor egomotion is
difficult because an object's observed motion consists of both its true motion
and the sensor motion. Most previous works in multimotion estimation simplify
this problem by relying on appearance-based object detection or
application-specific motion constraints. These approaches are effective in
specific applications and environments but do not generalize well to the full
multimotion estimation problem (MEP).
  This paper presents Multimotion Visual Odometry (MVO), a multimotion
estimation pipeline that estimates the full SE(3) trajectory of every motion in
the scene, including the sensor egomotion, without relying on appearance-based
information. MVO extends the traditional visual odometry (VO) pipeline with
multimotion segmentation and tracking techniques. It uses physically founded
motion priors to extrapolate motions through temporary occlusions and identify
the reappearance of motions through motion closure. Evaluations on real-world
data from the Oxford Multimotion Dataset (OMD) and the KITTI Vision Benchmark
Suite demonstrate that MVO achieves good estimation accuracy compared to
similar approaches and is applicable to a variety of multimotion estimation
challenges.

predict both a coherent and incoherent response, the latter of which is

degradation as the number of layers increases, which is usually attributed to

not necessarily happen in practice, a deeper model is provably expressive, can
converge to global optimum with linear convergence rate, and achieve very high

achieving high training accuracy, empirical results show that the deeper models

of such behavior remains elusive. To achieve better understanding, we carefully
analyze the generalization capability of GCNs, and show that the training
strategies to achieve high training accuracy significantly deteriorate the
generalization capability of GCNs. Motivated by these findings, we propose a
decoupled structure for GCNs that detaches weight matrices from feature

performance. We conduct empirical evaluations on various synthetic and

spaces that carry small balls to convex sets, provided that the radius of the
balls is small enough. Such a property is important in many related to applied
problems. If a nonlinear mapping of Hilbert spaces is smooth and regular, it
implies convexity of the image of balls and has profound geometric properties
of the underlying space and the preservation of convexity via linear
approximations. The present study is focused on the analysis of the mild
sufficient conditions for a nonlinear mapping of Banach spaces to be locally
convex. In contrast to the Hilbert space case, when the local convexity is
based on the strong convexity of the ball% %$B_{r}(a)\subset X$ , in the case
of a Banach space the local convexity property is based on much more subtle
properties both of a mapping and a Banach space under regard. Special attention
is paid to the locally convex functions between Banach spaces. In this part of
paper we address a suitably reformulated local convexity problem for Banach
spaces. The problem is solved in terms of the interplay between the modulus of
smoothness of the function $f$ and the modulus of convexity of the Banach space
upon thorough study of the local regularity properties of the nonlinear
mappings and the related Banach space convexity characteristics. Some of the
results presented in the work appear to be interesting and novel even for
finite-dimensional problems. Open problems related to the local convexity
property for nonlinear mapping of Banach spaces are also formulated.

the displacemon architecture to create non-Gaussian mechanical states out of

simulations, we experimentally reveal the existence of three basic components
in water. These components exhibit distinct structures, densities, and
temperature dependencies. Among the three, two major components correspond to
the low-density liquid (LDL) and the high-density liquid (HDL) predicted by the
two-component model, and the third component exhibits a unique 5-hydrogen-bond
configuration with an ultra-high local density. As the temperature increases,
the LDL component decreases and the HDL component increases, while the third
component varies non-monotonically with a peak around 20 $^{\circ}$C to 30
$^{\circ}$C. The 3D structure of the third component is further illustrated as
the uniform distribution of five hydrogen-bonded neighbors on a spherical
surface. Our study reveals experimental evidence for water's unique
three-component structure, which provides a fundamental basis for understanding
water's special properties and anomalies.

facilitate advances in the understanding of which genes underlie agronomically
important traits and have enabled the use of genome-wide markers to accelerate
genetic gain. The logistic regression model is a statistically optimal approach
for quantitative genetics analysis of binary traits. To encourage more
widespread use of the logistic model in such analyses, efforts need to be made
to address separation, which occurs whenever a specific combination of
predictors can perfectly predict the value of a binary trait. Data separation
is especially prevalent in applications where the number of predictors is near
the sample size. In this study we motivate a logistic model that is robust to
separation, and we develop a novel prediction procedure for this robust model
that is appropriate when separation exists. We show that this robust model
offers superior inferences and comparable predictions to existing approaches
while remaining true to the logistic model. This is an improvement to
previously existing approaches which treats separation as a modeling
shortcoming and not an antagonistic data configuration. Previous approaches,
therefore, change the modeling paradigm to consider separation that, before our
robust model exists, is problematic to logistic models. Our comparisons are
conducted on several didactic examples and a genomics study on the kernel color
in maize. The ensuing analyses reaffirm the billed superior inferences and
comparable predictive performance of our robust model. Therefore, our approach
provides scientists with an appropriate statistical modeling framework for

swapping the edges to obtain the optimal edge distribution. Finally, the
obtained graph is mapped into a neural network structure to realize pruning.

an ad-hoc group of data-holders (agents) collaborate with each other and
perform federated learning? Such an API would necessarily need to be
model-agnostic i.e. make no assumption about the model architecture being used
by the agents, and also cannot rely on having representative public data at
hand. Knowledge distillation (KD) is the obvious tool of choice to design such
protocols. However, surprisingly, we show that most natural KD-based federated
learning protocols have poor performance.
  To investigate this, we propose a new theoretical framework, Federated Kernel
ridge regression, which can capture both model heterogeneity as well as data
heterogeneity. Our analysis shows that the degradation is largely due to a
fundamental limitation of knowledge distillation under data heterogeneity. We
further validate our framework by analyzing and designing new protocols based
on KD. Their performance on real world experiments using neural networks,
though still unsatisfactory, closely matches our theoretical predictions.

in a molecular gas are determined. We assume that the number density of the
granular gas is much smaller than that of the surrounding molecular gas, so
that the latter is not affected by the presence of solid particles. In this
situation, the molecular gas may be treated as a thermostat (or bath) of
elastic hard spheres at a fixed temperature. This system (granular gas
thermostated by a bath of elastic hard spheres) can be considered as a reliable
model for describing the dynamic properties of particle-laden suspensions. The
Boltzmann kinetic equation is the starting point of the present work. First
step is to characterise the reference state in the perturbation scheme, namely
the homogeneous state. Theoretical results for the granular temperature and
kurtosis obtained in the homogeneous steady state are compared against Monte
Carlo simulations showing a good agreement. Then, the Chapman-Enskog method is
employed to solve the Boltzmann equation to first order in spatial gradients.
As expected, the Navier-Stokes-Fourier transport coefficients of the granular
gas are given in terms of the solutions of a coupled set of linear integral
equations which are approximately solved by considering the leading terms in a
Sonine polynomial expansion. Our results show that the dependence of the
transport coefficients on the coefficient of restitution is quite different
from that found when the influence of the interstitial molecular gas is
neglected (dry granular gas). When the granular particles are much more heavier
than the gas particles (Brownian limit) the expressions of the transport
coefficients are consistent with those previously derived from the
Fokker-Planck equation. Finally, a linear stability analysis of the homogeneous
steady state is performed showing this state is always linearly stable.

design and conduct a series of high-pressure experiments on FeSe thin flakes.
We find that, as the thickness decreases, the nematic phase boundary on

significantly weakened. A local maximum of $T_c$ is observed outside the
nematic phase region, not far from the extrapolated nematic endpoint in all

(OOD) detection have recently increased in popularity. A recent attempt to
categorize OOD data introduces the concept of near and far OOD detection.
Specifically, prior works define characteristics of OOD data in terms of
detection difficulty. We propose to characterize the spectrum of OOD data using
two types of distribution shifts: covariate shift and concept shift, where
covariate shift corresponds to change in style, e.g., noise, and concept shift
indicates a change in semantics. This characterization reveals that sensitivity
to each type of shift is important to the detection and confidence calibration
of OOD data. Consequently, we investigate score functions that capture
sensitivity to each type of dataset shift and methods that improve them. To
this end, we theoretically derive two score functions for OOD detection, the
covariate shift score and concept shift score, based on the decomposition of
KL-divergence for both scores, and propose a geometrically-inspired method
(Geometric ODIN) to improve OOD detection under both shifts with only
in-distribution data. Additionally, the proposed method naturally leads to an
expressive post-hoc calibration function which yields state-of-the-art
calibration performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.
We are the first to propose a method that works well across both OOD detection
and calibration and under different types of shifts. View project page at

account. The absorption bleaching at high intensity is shown to be strongly
suppressed by the elastic scattering. The linear-circular dichroism of one- and

ultracold atoms can be coupled to a repulsive collisional channel by the laser
light so that the overall interaction between the two atoms becomes repulsive:
this prevents them to come close together and to undergo inelastic processes,
thus protecting the atomic gases from unwanted losses. We illustrate such an
optical shielding mechanism with potassium and cesium atoms colliding at
ultracold temperature (\textless 1 microkelvin). The process is described in
the framework of the dressed-state picture and we then solve the resulting

characterized by a Rabi frequency of $\omega = 200$~MHz and a frequency detuned
from the potassium D2 transition by $\Delta = 200$~MHz. We found the
polarization of the laser has no influence on this efficiency. This proposal
could easily be formulated for other bi-alkali-metal pairs as their long-range
interaction are all very similar to each other.

speed of photonic hardware to reach unprecedented throughput rates. We
theoretically describe some of the key underlying principles, and then
numerically illustrate the reached performances on a photonic lattice-based
implementation. We apply the technique both to picosecond pulsed
radio-frequency signals, on energy-spectral-density estimation and a shape
classification task, and to continuous signals, on a frequency tracking task.
The presented optical computing scheme is resilient to noise while requiring
minimal control on the photonic-lattice parameters, making it readily
implementable in realistic state-of-the-art photonic platforms.

atmospheric residuals and aberrations in the non-common path. Those non-common
path aberrations (NCPA) are particularly challenging to compensate for as they
are not directly measured, and because they include static, quasi-static and
dynamic components. The proposed method directly addresses the challenge of
compensating the NCPA. The algorithm DrWHO - Direct Reinforcement Wavefront

dynamic NCPA for boosting image contrast. It is an image-based lucky imaging
approach, aimed at finding and continuously updating the ideal reference of the
wavefront sensor (WFS) that includes the NCPA, and updating this new reference
to the WFS. Doing so changes the point of convergence of the AO loop. We show

left to right, but this eliminates a source of information: the order by which
the sequence was generated. One strategy to recover this information is to
decode both the content and ordering of tokens. Existing approaches supervise
content and ordering by designing problem-specific loss functions and
pre-training with an ordering pre-selected. Other recent works use iterative
search to discover problem-specific orderings for training, but suffer from
high time complexity and cannot be efficiently parallelized. We address these
limitations with an unsupervised parallelizable learner that discovers
high-quality generation orders purely from training data -- no domain knowledge
required. The learner contains an encoder network and decoder language model
that perform variational inference with autoregressive orders (represented as
permutation matrices) as latent variables. The corresponding ELBO is not
differentiable, so we develop a practical algorithm for end-to-end optimization
using policy gradients. We implement the encoder as a Transformer with
non-causal attention that outputs permutations in one forward pass.
Permutations then serve as target generation orders for training an
insertion-based Transformer language model. Empirical results in language
modeling tasks demonstrate that our method is context-aware and discovers
orderings that are competitive with or even better than fixed orders.

separable and hence we content ourselves to find a linear classifier with the
largest possible \emph{negative} margin. In other words, we want to find a unit
norm vector ${\boldsymbol \theta}$ that maximizes $\min_{i\le n}y_i\langle
{\boldsymbol \theta},{\boldsymbol x}_i\rangle$. This is a non-convex
optimization problem (it is equivalent to finding a maximum norm vector in a
polytope), and we study its typical properties under two random models for the
data.
  We consider the proportional asymptotics in which $n,d\to \infty$ with
$n/d\to\delta$, and prove upper and lower bounds on the maximum margin
$\kappa_{\text{s}}(\delta)$ or -- equivalently -- on its inverse function
$\delta_{\text{s}}(\kappa)$. In other words, $\delta_{\text{s}}(\kappa)$ is the

training error exists with high probability, while for $n/d\ge

We then analyze a linear programming algorithm to find a solution, and
characterize the corresponding threshold $\delta_{\text{lin}}(\kappa)$. We
observe a gap between the interpolation threshold $\delta_{\text{s}}(\kappa)$
and the linear programming threshold $\delta_{\text{lin}}(\kappa)$, raising the

plates toward each other, the squeezing flow which is perpendicular to the
plates is appeared. We assume that inclination varies from zero to ninety
degrees. The momentum and energy equations are solved using the Adomian
decomposition method with the combination of Fourier transform. The effect of
the squeezed number, the angle of magnetic inclination, and the bottom plate
suction/injection on the velocity and temperature are studied. The results show
that by increasing the squeeze number, the intensity of the magnetic field and
the magnetic inclined angle may increase the velocity near up and bottom plates
in the longitudinal direction. However, the velocity near the midway of up and
bottom plates may decrease. Moreover, our results show more accuracy and a
smaller number of calculations when compared to the previous numerical
simulations. This may be attributed to the fact that in the FTADM, one is able
to incorporate all boundary conditions into the solution. However, in the
semi-analytical methods, the solution may be accurate in a limited portion of
the solution domain because only a part of boundary conditions is imposed into

demonstrate that for strong gravitational field occurring in neutron star
merger with mass exceeding the Tolman, Oppenheimer and Volkoff limit the
quantum statistics of particles beneath the photon sphere decays, which results
in an instant relief of quantum degeneracy pressure in the star. This causes a
rapid shrink of the matter to a black hole with quite different quantum
collective character of particles. The scheme of neutron Fermi sphere collapse
is proposed as the possible isotropic source of short giant gamma-ray bursts.
The similar quantum mechanism of collapse of Fermi spheres of electrons and
protons in plasma of accretion disc in vicinity of the Schwarzschild horizon of
galactic black hole is able to elucidate the giant luminosity of remote
quasars. The efficiency of the mass to energy conversion via collapse of the
Fermi sphere is ca. 30%, not reachable for any other known physical process
except of the matter-antimatter annihilation.

decision making process. Building an AI agent that can automate such
recommendation process can significantly help reduce costs, and eliminate human
biases and errors. However, limited sample size of financial data-sets and the
need for not only good recommendations, but also explaining why a particular
recommendation is being made, makes this a challenging problem. In this work we
propose a representation learning based recommendation engine that works
extremely well with small datasets and demonstrate how it can be coupled with a
parameterized explanation generation engine to build an explainable
recommendation system for investor-company matching. We compare the performance
of our system with human generated recommendations and demonstrate the ability
of our algorithm to perform extremely well on this task. We also highlight how
explainability helps with real-life adoption of our system.

  variability on filtration performance",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We model porous membrane filters as networks of connected cylindrical pores
via a random network generation protocol, and their initial pore radii via a
uniform distribution of widths that vary about some mean value. We investigate
the influence of network and pore size (radius) variations on the performance
of membrane filters that undergo adsorptive fouling. We find that membrane
porosity variations, independently of whether induced by variations of the pore
radii or of the random pore network, are an important factor determining
membrane filter performance. Network and pore size variations still play a
role, in particular if pore radii variations are significant. To quantify the
influence of these variations, we compare the performance metrics of networks
built from pores of variable radii to their (equal porosity) counterparts built
from pores of uniform radius. We show that the effect of pore radii variations
is to increase throughput, but also to reduce foulant control.

  through graphene-metal contacts","17 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.supr-con","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) recently exhibited robust
superconductivity at a higher transition temperature (TC) than the bilayer
version. With electric gating from both the top and bottom sides, the
superconductivity was found to be closely associated to two conditions: the
finite broken mirror symmetry and carrier concentrations between two to three
carriers per moir\'e unite cell. Both conditions may be achieved by
graphene-metal contacts where charge transfers and interfacial electric fields
are generated to balance work function mismatch. In this study, we explore the
superconductivity of MATTG when contacting a metal, through self-consistently
solving the interfacial charge transfer with a highly electric-field-dependent
band structure of MATTG. The predicted TC of MATTG-metal contacts forms two
domes as a function of the work function difference over the interface, with a
maximum over 2 K. Our work provides a constructive reference for graphene
experiments and industrial applications with graphene-metal and
graphene-semiconductor contacts.

  Context Information","3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for Human Activity
  Recognition",,,,"eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider human activity recognition (HAR) from wearable sensor data in
manual-work processes, like warehouse order-picking. Such structured domains
can often be partitioned into distinct process steps, e.g., packaging or
transporting. Each process step can have a different prior distribution over
activity classes, e.g., standing or walking, and different system dynamics.
Here, we show how such context information can be integrated systematically
into a deep neural network-based HAR system. Specifically, we propose a hybrid
architecture that combines a deep neural network-that estimates high-level
movement descriptors, attributes, from the raw-sensor data-and a shallow
classifier, which predicts activity classes from the estimated attributes and
(optional) context information, like the currently executed process step. We
empirically show that our proposed architecture increases HAR performance,
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we show that HAR
performance can be further increased when information about process steps is
incorporated, even when that information is only partially correct.

dynamical systems. Naturally, strict instances of this phenomenon, such as the
states of complete synchronization are favored, or even ensured, in networks
with a high density of connections. Conversely, in sparse networks, the system
state-space is often shared by a variety of coexistent solutions. Consequently,
the convergence to complete synchronized states is far from being certain. In
this scenario, we report the surprising phenomenon in which completely
synchronized states are made the sole attractor of sparse networks by removing
network links, the sparsity-driven synchronization. This phenomenon is observed
numerically for nonlocally coupled Kuramoto networks and verified analytically
for locally coupled ones. In addition, we reduce the network equations to a
one-dimension dynamical system to unravel the bifurcation scenario underlying
the network transition to completely synchronized behavior. Furthermore, we
present a simple procedure, based on the bifurcations in the thermodynamic
limit, that determines the minimum number of links to be removed in order to
ensure complete synchronization. Finally, we propose an application of the
reported phenomenon as a control scheme to drive complete synchronization in
high connectivity networks.
