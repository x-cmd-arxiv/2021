mandates on COVID-19 in Fall 2020. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate how the
relative growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths would have differed if all states
had issued a mandate to mask in public by September 1, 2020 versus if all
states had delayed issuing such a mandate. To do so, we applied the Causal
Roadmap, a formal framework for causal and statistical inference. The outcome
was defined as the state-specific relative increase in cumulative cases and in
cumulative deaths {21, 30, 45, 60}-days after September 1. Despite the natural
experiment in state-level masking policies, the causal effect of interest was
not identifiable. Nonetheless, we specified the target statistical parameter as
the adjusted rate ratio (aRR): the expected outcome with early implementation
divided by the expected outcome with delayed implementation, after adjusting
for state-level confounders. To minimize strong estimation assumptions, primary
analyses used targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner.
After 60-days and at a national-level, early implementation was associated 9%
reduction in new COVID-19 cases (aRR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.88-0.95) and a 16%
reduction in new COVID-19 deaths (aRR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.76-0.93). Although lack
of identifiability prohibited causal interpretations, application of the Causal
Roadmap facilitated estimation and inference of statistical associations,
providing timely answers to pressing questions in the COVID-19 response.

method including a fast pseudo-shading algorithm, that can quickly and
accurately determine the forces and torques on satellites in free-molecular
flow. Our main method of validation is comparing test cases between ADBSat, the
current de facto standard of direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), and
published literature. ADBSat exhibits a significantly shorter runtime than DSMC
and performs well, except where deep concavities are present in the satellite
models. The shading algorithm also experiences problems when a large proportion
of the satellite surface area is oriented parallel to the flow, but this can be
mitigated by examining the body at small angles to this configuration (${\pm}$
0.1{\deg}). We recommend that an error interval on ADBSat outputs of up to 3\%
is adopted. Therefore, ADBSat is a suitable tool for quickly determining the
aerodynamic characteristics of a wide range of satellite geometries in
different environmental conditions in VLEO. It can also be used in a
complementary manner to identify cases that warrant further investigation using
other numerical-based methods.

the numerical solution of Volterra-type equations, the computational bottleneck
is the quadratic-scaling cost of history integration. However, the structure of
the nonlinear Volterra integral operator precludes the use of standard fast

the structure of the nonlinear integral operator. The resulting method can
reach large propagation times, and is thus well-suited to explore quantum

semantic product search. When training a dyadic model, one seeks to embed two
different types of entities (e.g., queries and documents or users and movies)
in a common vector space such that pairs with high relevance are positioned
nearby. During inference, given an embedding of one type (e.g., a query or a
user), one seeks to retrieve the entities of the other type (e.g., documents or

exploiting the natural structure of real-world datasets helps address both
challenges efficiently. Specifically, we model dyadic data as a bipartite graph
with edges between pairs with positive associations. We then propose to
partition this network into semantically coherent clusters and thus reduce our
search space by focusing on a small subset of these partitions for a given
input. During training, this technique enables us to efficiently mine hard
negative examples while, at inference, we can quickly find the nearest
neighbors for a given embedding. We provide offline experimental results that

parametric spatial audio effects for data augmentation, which modifies the
directional properties of a multi-channel spatial audio signal encoded in the
ambisonics domain. Similarly to beamforming, these modifications enhance or
suppress signals arriving from certain directions, although the effect is less
pronounced. Therefore enabling deep learning models to achieve invariance to
small spatial perturbations. The method is evaluated with experiments in the

regularization method applied to this objective function to identify a set of
important mediators. We derive the asymptotic properties of our estimator and
establish the oracle property under certain assumptions. Asymptotic results are
also presented in a local setting which contrast the proposal with the standard

function. To describe a non-vanishing free oscillation we use an analytic
approach based on the method of stationary phase and the method of multiple
scales. The moving oscillator is characterized by a partial frequency, which
can be greater or less than the cut-off frequency. Accordingly, a sub-critical
uniformly accelerated motion generally has two stages. At the first stage there
exists a trapped mode, and, therefore, a part of the wave energy is localized
near the moving oscillator and does not propagate away. For this stage we
obtain the analytic solution in a simple form describing non-vanishing free
oscillation and verify it numerically. For the second stage there is no trapped
mode, and all the wave energy propagate away. This stage is investigated
numerically, and some unexpected results are obtained. Additionally, we
consider the case of the oscillator with a destabilizing spring. The dynamics
of the system in the latter case is quite different from the case of commonly
used stabilizing spring, since the system loses the stability during an
accelerated motion. We also take into consideration the forced oscillation
caused by an external load being a superposition of harmonics with time-varying

exponential scaling of computational cost with system dimensions. Quantum
computer offers the potential to simulate quantum dynamics with polynomial

techniques require large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers that remain
elusive in the near future. Here we present variational simulations of
real-space quantum dynamics suitable for implementation in Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The Hamiltonian is first encoded
onto qubits using a discrete variable representation (DVR) and binary encoding
scheme. We show that direct application of real-time variational quantum
algorithm based on the McLachlan's principle is inefficient as the measurement
cost grows exponentially with the qubit number for general potential energy and
extremely small time-step size is required to achieve accurate results.
Motivated by the insights that most chemical dynamics occur in the low energy
subspace, we propose a subspace expansion method by projecting the total
Hamiltonian, including the time-dependent driving field, onto the system
low-energy eigenstate subspace using quantum computers, the exact quantum
dynamics within the subspace can then be solved classically. We show that the
measurement cost of the subspace approach grows polynomially with
dimensionality for general potential energy. Our numerical examples demonstrate
the capability of our approach, even under intense laser fields. Our work opens

Thomass\'e, and Watrigan. Problems expressible in first-order logic, which
includes many prominent NP-hard problems, are tractable on graphs of bounded
twin-width if a certificate for the twin-width bound is provided as an input.
Computing such a certificate, however, is an intrinsic problem, for which no
nontrivial algorithm is known.
  In this paper, we propose the first practical approach for computing the
twin-width of graphs together with the corresponding certificate. We propose
efficient SAT-encodings that rely on a characterization of twin-width based on
elimination sequences. This allows us to determine the twin-width of many
famous graphs with previously unknown twin-width. We utilize our encodings to
identify the smallest graphs for a given twin-width bound $d \in
\{1,\dots,4\}$.

over an order of magnitude. It has been suggested from infrared observations
that one of the Wolf-Rayet stars in Apep is launching an anisotropic wind. Here
we present radio observations of Apep from 0.2 to 20 GHz taken over 33 years.
The spectrum reveals an extremely steep turnover in the flux density at low
frequencies, where the flux density decreases by two orders of magnitude over
only 325 MHz of bandwidth. This exponential decline is best described by
free-free absorption, with a turnover frequency at 0.54 $\pm$ 0.01 GHz. Above
the turnover, the spectrum is well described by a power-law and a
high-frequency cut-off likely caused by inverse-Compton cooling. The lightcurve
of Apep shows significant variation over the observing period, with Apep
brightening by over 50 mJy in a span of 25 years at 1.4 GHz. Models that assume
spherical winds do not replicate all of the structure evident in the radio
lightcurve. We derived a model that allows one of the winds in the system to be
anisotropic. This anisotropic model recovers most of the structure of the
lightcurve and is a significantly better statistical fit to the data than the
spherical wind model. We suggest such a result is independent support that one
of the Wolf-Rayet stars in Apep is launching an anisotropic wind. If the
anisotropic wind model is correct, we predict a ~25% decrease of the 1.4 GHz
flux density of Apep over the next five years.

through quantization. Sparse matrix compression is utilized to further compress
the interlayer feature maps. The on-chip memory allocation scheme is designed

in TSMC 28-nm COMS technology. It achieves 403GOPS peak throughput and
1.4x~3.3x interlayer feature map reduction by adding light hardware area

Recently, skeleton-based action recognition has attracted increasing attention

Specifically, we propose a Sign Language Graph Convolution Network (SL-GCN) to

to certain ""constants"" of integration, and a potential part that encodes the
full non-linear curvature, and that coincides in form with the Hertz potential

learning a policy that improves over the behavior policy that collected the
dataset, while at the same time minimizing the deviation from the behavior
policy so as to avoid errors due to distributional shift. This trade-off is
critical, because most current offline reinforcement learning methods need to
query the value of unseen actions during training to improve the policy, and
therefore need to either constrain these actions to be in-distribution, or else
regularize their values. We propose an offline RL method that never needs to
evaluate actions outside of the dataset, but still enables the learned policy
to improve substantially over the best behavior in the data through
generalization. The main insight in our work is that, instead of evaluating
unseen actions from the latest policy, we can approximate the policy
improvement step implicitly by treating the state value function as a random
variable, with randomness determined by the action (while still integrating
over the dynamics to avoid excessive optimism), and then taking a state
conditional upper expectile of this random variable to estimate the value of
the best actions in that state. This leverages the generalization capacity of
the function approximator to estimate the value of the best available action at
a given state without ever directly querying a Q-function with this unseen
action. Our algorithm alternates between fitting this upper expectile value
function and backing it up into a Q-function. Then, we extract the policy via
advantage-weighted behavioral cloning. We dub our method implicit Q-learning
(IQL). IQL demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on D4RL, a standard
benchmark for offline reinforcement learning. We also demonstrate that IQL
achieves strong performance fine-tuning using online interaction after offline

edges occupancy in transportation networks, however the second guarantees
convergence to an optimal configuration of flows. Both modeling choices are

infrastructure resilience to node removal, showing that the two settings are
equivalent in the congested transport regime, but different in the branched

with one function favoring routes consolidation, thus potentially being prone
to generate traffic overload. Additionally, we compare our method to Dijkstra's

changes in the data distribution, and certain -- but not all -- distribution
shifts could result in significant performance degradation. In practice, it may
make sense to ignore benign shifts, under which the performance of a deployed
model does not degrade substantially, making interventions by a human expert
(or model retraining) unnecessary. While several works have developed tests for
distribution shifts, these typically either use non-sequential methods, or
detect arbitrary shifts (benign or harmful), or both. We argue that a sensible
method for firing off a warning has to both (a) detect harmful shifts while
ignoring benign ones, and (b) allow continuous monitoring of model performance
without increasing the false alarm rate. In this work, we design simple
sequential tools for testing if the difference between source (training) and
target (test) distributions leads to a significant increase in a risk function
of interest, like accuracy or calibration. Recent advances in constructing
time-uniform confidence sequences allow efficient aggregation of statistical
evidence accumulated during the tracking process. The designed framework is
applicable in settings where (some) true labels are revealed after the

delayed fashion. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework through
an extensive empirical study on a collection of simulated and real datasets.

Convolutions (TAdaConv) for video understanding, which shows that adaptive
weight calibration along the temporal dimension is an efficient way to
facilitate modelling complex temporal dynamics in videos. Specifically,
TAdaConv empowers the spatial convolutions with temporal modelling abilities by
calibrating the convolution weights for each frame according to its local and
global temporal context. Compared to previous temporal modelling operations,
TAdaConv is more efficient as it operates over the convolution kernels instead
of the features, whose dimension is an order of magnitude smaller than the
spatial resolutions. Further, the kernel calibration brings an increased model
capacity. We construct TAda2D and TAdaConvNeXt networks by replacing the 2D
convolutions in ResNet and ConvNeXt with TAdaConv, which leads to at least on

must acquire at once several signals at a very wide but sparsely and

the resolution requirements can be prohibitively high. As an alternative, the
recently proposed modulo-ADC architecture can in principle require dramatically
fewer bits in the conversion to obtain the target fidelity, but requires that
spatiotemporal information be known and explicitly taken into account by the

and high index of refraction, which allows for low-mass-density designs.
However, here we show that the temperature-dependent bandgap of silicon
combined with two-photon absorption processes can lead to thermal runaway for
even the most optimistic viable assumptions of the material quality. From our
calculations, we set bounds on the maximum laser intensities that can be used
for a thermally stable, Si-based laser sail.

  Discrete Optimization of Structural Design","18 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables. Submitted to a journal",,,,"cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This paper presents several strategies to tune the parameters of
metaheuristic methods for (discrete) design optimization of reinforced concrete
(RC) structures. A novel utility metric is proposed, based on the area under
the average performance curve. The process of modelling, analysis and design of
realistic RC structures leads to objective functions for which the evaluation
is computationally very expensive. To avoid costly simulations, two types of
surrogate models are used. The first one consists of the creation of a database
containing all possible solutions. The second one uses benchmark functions to
create a discrete sub-space of them, simulating the main features of realistic
problems. Parameter tuning of four metaheuristics is performed based on two
strategies. The main difference between them is the parameter control
established to perform partial assessments. The simplest strategy is suitable
to tune good `generalist' methods, i.e., methods with good performance
regardless the parameter configuration. The other one is more expensive, but is
well suited to assess any method. Tuning results prove that Biogeography-Based
Optimization, a relatively new evolutionary algorithm, outperforms other
methods such as GA or PSO for such optimization problems, due to its particular
approach of applying recombination and mutation operators.

challenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because
stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible
periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy
minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the
structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between
different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and
often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational
Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material
stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the
decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic
coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy
bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes
interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation,
rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in
three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid,
diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a
specific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation

geometrically decaying stepsize, we prove nearly matching upper and lower

unique features not visible near the compensation point. In particular, we find
that current-induced torques can trigger spontaneous oscillation of the

density but also can be self-stabilized, obviating the need for dynamic

The MS and Y grain data demonstrate that (1) C and N contamination mainly
appears as surface contamination, and sufficient presputtering is needed to
expose a clean grain surface for obtaining intrinsic C and N signals, and (2)
Mg and Al contamination appears as adjacent grains and rims, and
high-resolution imaging and the choice of small regions of interest during data
reduction together are effective in suppressing the contamination. Our results
strongly indicate that previous studies on presolar SiC grains could have
sampled differing degrees of contamination for C, N, Mg, and Al. Compared to
the literature data, our new MS and Y grains are in better agreement with
carbon star observations for both the C and N isotopic ratios. By comparing our
new, tighter distributions of 12C/13C, 14N/15N, and initial 26Al/27Al ratios
for MS and Y grains with FRUITY AGB stellar models, we provide more stringent
constraints on the occurrence of cool bottom processing and the production of
26Al in N-type carbon stars, classical asymptotic giant branch stars.

Transformer (StARformer) for visual RL, which explicitly models short-term
state-action-reward representations (StAR-representations), essentially
introducing a Markovian-like inductive bias to improve long-term modeling. Our
approach first extracts StAR-representations by self-attending image state
patches, action, and reward tokens within a short temporal window. These are
then combined with pure image state representations -- extracted as
convolutional features, to perform self-attention over the whole sequence. Our
experiments show that StARformer outperforms the state-of-the-art

semantic classes in a classifier's training set is critical to practical
deployment of the model. This task is termed open-set recognition (OSR) and has
received significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we first
demonstrate that the ability of a classifier to make the 'none-of-above'
decision is highly correlated with its accuracy on the closed-set classes. We
find that this relationship holds across loss objectives and architectures, and
further demonstrate the trend both on the standard OSR benchmarks as well as on
a large-scale ImageNet evaluation. Second, we use this correlation to boost the
performance of a maximum logit score OSR 'baseline' by improving its closed-set
accuracy, and with this strong baseline achieve state-of-the-art on a number of
OSR benchmarks. Similarly, we boost the performance of the existing
state-of-the-art method by improving its closed-set accuracy, but the resulting
discrepancy with the strong baseline is marginal. Our third contribution is to
present the 'Semantic Shift Benchmark' (SSB), which better respects the task of
detecting semantic novelty, in contrast to other forms of distribution shift
also considered in related sub-fields, such as out-of-distribution detection.
On this new evaluation, we again demonstrate that there is negligible
difference between the strong baseline and the existing state-of-the-art.

integration of technology. However, ensuring that various transportation system
components are operating as expected and in a safe manner is a great challenge.
In this work, we propose the use of formal methods as a means to specify and
reason about the traffic network's complex properties. Formal methods provide a
flexible tool to define the safe operation of the traffic network by capturing
non-conforming behavior, exploring various possible states of the traffic
scene, and detecting any inconsistencies within it. Hence, we develop
specification-based monitoring for the analysis of traffic networks using the
formal language, Signal Temporal Logic. We develop monitors that identify
safety-related behavior such as conforming to speed limits and maintaining
appropriate headway. The framework is tested using a calibrated micro-simulated
highway scenario and offline specification-based monitoring is applied to
individual vehicle trajectories to understand whether they violate or satisfy
the defined safety specifications. Statistical analysis of the outputs show
that our approach can differentiate violating from conforming vehicle
trajectories based on the defined specifications. This work can be utilized by
traffic management centers to study the traffic stream properties, identify
possible hazards, and provide valuable feedback for automating the traffic

anomaly analogous to, but very different from, the well known gauge and
gravitational anomalies. It closely resembles the known gauge anomalies, but it
results from a triangle diagram with two gravitinos and a gauge vector boson,
rather than three gauge vector bosons, or two gravitons and a vector boson. A
model that is likely to generate this supergravity anomaly is described. The
coefficient of this anomaly, in perturbation theory, in a theory with unbroken
supersymmetry, appears to be zero, because no relevant diagrams are linearly
divergent. However, when, and only when, the theory has spontaneously broken
supergravity, there are counterterms in the action which contribute to linearly
divergent diagrams that can generate the anomaly. From the relevant Feynman
diagrams in the theory, the general form of the anomaly can be conjectured. It
is proportional to the VEV $\left< D^a \right>$ of the auxiliary field for the
vector boson. So removing the anomaly generates a requirement that the
effective spontaneous breaking of supergravity needs to be of the purely chiral
type with $\left< F^i \right> \not = 0$ and with $\left< D^a \right>=0$.

transcription factors have been very successful at predicting gene expression

as well in eukaryotes, most likely due to the largely out-of-equilibrium nature
of eukaryotic regulatory processes. These processes come with unavoidable
energy expenditure at the molecular level to support precise, reliable, or fast
gene expression responses that could correspond to evolutionarily optimized
regulatory strategies. Unfortunately, the space of possible non-equilibrium
mechanisms is vast and predominantly uninteresting. The key question is
therefore how this space can be navigated efficiently, to focus on mechanisms
and models that are biologically relevant. In this review, we advocate for the
normative role of theory - theory that prescribes rather than just describes -
in providing such a focus. Theory should expand its remit beyond inferring
models from data (by fitting), towards identifying non-equilibrium gene
regulatory schemes (by optimizing) that may have been evolutionarily selected
due to their favorable functional characteristics which outperform regulation
at equilibrium. This approach can help us navigate the expanding complexity of
regulatory architectures, and refocus the questions about the observed
biological mechanisms from how they work towards why they have evolved in the
first place. We illustrate our reasoning by toy examples for which we provide

LoTSS-DR2 and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimetres (FIRST) data

loudness of the high-$z$ quasar sample to a lower-$z$ quasar sample at $z\sim2$

evolution, although the low number of high-z quasars means that we cannot rule
out weak evolution. Furthermore, we make a first order empirical estimate of
the $z=6$ quasar radio luminosity function, which is used to derive the
expected number of high-$z$ sources that will be detected in the completed
LoTSS survey. This work highlights the fact that new deep radio observations
can be a valuable tool in selecting high-$z$ quasar candidates for follow-up
spectroscopic observations by decreasing contamination of stellar dwarfs and
reducing possible selection biases introduced by strict colour cuts.

$4.5\mu$m bands amounts to $\sim 4260$ hr, $\sim 1220$ hr of which are new very
deep observations from the GREATS program itself. In the deepest area, the
full-depth mosaics reach $\gtrsim200$ hr over an area of $\sim100$ arcmin$^2$,
corresponding to a sensitivity of $\sim29$ AB magnitude at $3.6\mu$m ($1\sigma$
for point sources). Archival cryogenic $5.8\mu$m and $8.0\mu$m band data (a
cumulative 976 hr) are also included in the release. The mosaics are projected
onto the tangential plane of CANDELS/GOODS at a $0.3''$ pixel$^{-1}$ scale.
This paper describes the methodology enabling, and the characteristics of, the
public release of the mosaic science images, the corresponding coverage maps in
the four IRAC bands, and the empirical Point-Spread Functions (PSFs). These
PSFs enable mitigation of the source blending effects by taking into account
the complex position-dependent variation in the IRAC images. The GREATS data
products are in the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA). We also release the
deblended $3.6$-to-$8.0\mu$m photometry for $9192$ Lyman-Break galaxies at
$z\sim3.5-10$. GREATS will be the deepest mid-infrared imaging until JWST and,
as such, constitutes a major resource for characterizing early galaxy assembly.

state of dark energy evolves with redshift, the strong lensing constraints are
compatible with a cosmological constant (i.e. $w=-1$). In a curved cosmology,
our strong lensing analyses can accommodate a large range of values for the
curvature of the Universe of $\Omega_{\rm k}=0.28_{-0.21}^{+0.16}$. In all

fundamental domain for $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. In earlier work, these
integrals were evaluated for all MGFs up to two loops and for higher loops up
to weight six. These results led to the conjectured uniform transcendentality
of the genus-one four-graviton amplitude in Type II superstring theory. In this
paper, we explicitly evaluate the integrals of several infinite families of
three-loop MGFs and investigate their transcendental structure. Up to weight
seven, the structure of the integral of each individual MGF is consistent with
the uniform transcendentality of string amplitudes. Starting at weight eight,
the transcendental weights obtained for the integrals of individual MGFs are no
longer consistent with the uniform transcendentality of string amplitudes.
However, in all the cases we examine, the violations of uniform
transcendentality take on a special form given by the integrals of triple
products of non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. If Type II superstring
amplitudes do exhibit uniform transcendentality, then the special combinations

coherent light in wavelength regimes where no common laser diodes are
available. Nevertheless, the widespread use of such lasers is limited by their
high threshold power requirements on the order of several Watts. Using on-chip
microresonators, a significant reduction of the lasing threshold by more than
two orders of magnitude has been shown. However, these resonators lack a
continuous tuning mechanism and, mainly due to fabrication limitations, their
implementation in the visible remains elusive. Here, we propose a platform for
a diamond Raman laser in the visible. The device is based on a miniaturized,
open-access Fabry-Perot cavity. Our microcavity provides widely-tunable
doubly-resonant enhancement of Raman scattering from high quality
single-crystalline diamond. We demonstrate a $>$THz continuous tuning range of
doubly-resonant Raman scattering, a range limited only by the reflective
stopband of the mirrors. Based on the experimentally determined quality factors
exceeding $300\,000$, our theoretical analysis suggests that, with realistic
improvements, a sub-mW threshold is readily within reach. Our findings pave the
way to the creation of a universal low-power frequency shifter, a potentially
valuable addition to the nonlinear optics toolbox.

of effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$), surface gravity ($\log{g}$),

Medium-Resolution Survey (LAMOST-MRS), respectively. To estimate the average
statistical uncertainties of our results, we calculated the standard deviation
between the predicted stellar label and the pre-labeled published values from
the high-resolution spectra. The uncertainties of the four parameters are
$\sigma(T_\mathrm{eff}) = 2,185 $K, $\sigma(\log{g}) = 0.29$ dex, and
$\sigma(v\sin{i}) = 11\, \rm km\,s^{-1}$ for MRS, and $\sigma(T_\mathrm{eff}) =

supposed to give information regarding emission during the collapse.
Nevertheless, partly owing to operator ordering ambiguities involved in a
typical quantum gravity analysis, the availability of such well-defined modes
is not guaranteed. We study the mode decomposition of the unitarily evolving
wave packet constructed for the quantum model of spherically symmetric dust
collapsing in a marginally bound Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model. We
identify the observable depicting mode decomposition, and using the freedom of
operator ordering ambiguity, we obtain the Hermitian extension of this operator
alongside the Hermitian Hamiltonian. After identifying incoming and outgoing
modes with this operator's eigenstates, we estimate their contributions to the
radiation profile. The infrared sector of this process demonstrates some
characteristic features which turn out to be highly sensitive to the
near-bounce dynamics of the dust cloud. Near the epoch of classical
singularity, there is a significant contribution from incoming/outgoing modes
of small wavenumber in the expanding/collapsing phase of the dust cloud, which
keeps on decreasing as one moves away from the singularity. The information of
the bounce is carried over to the infrared modes through a flip from largely
incoming to largely outgoing radiation as the evolution progresses from
collapsing to expanding phase, much before the information of bounce comes
about to any observer. In the infrared sector, the saturation value of the
amplitude marks the bounce radius. Thus, we argue that the information of the
short scale physics is essentially carried over to the longest wavelength in
this quantum gravity model, which we argue is rather more prominent for low
energy processes.

dynamics and ultimately planetesimal formation in protoplanetary discs. As a
linear instability, it has been shown that its growth with a distribution of
dust sizes can be classified into two distinct regimes, fast- and slow-growth,
depending on the dust-size distribution and the total dust-to-gas density ratio
$\epsilon$. Using numerical simulations of an unstratified disc, we bring three
cases in different regimes into nonlinear saturation. We find that the
saturation states of the two fast-growth cases are similar to its
single-species counterparts. The one with maximum dimensionless stopping time
$\tau_\mathrm{s,max}=0.1$ and $\epsilon=2$ drives turbulent vertical dust-gas
vortices, while the other with $\tau_\mathrm{s,max}=2$ and $\epsilon=0.2$ leads
to radial traffic jams and filamentary structures of dust particles. The dust
density distribution for the former is flat in low densities, while the one for
the latter has a low-end cutoff. By contrast, the one slow-growth case results
in a virtually quiescent state. Moreover, we find that in the fast-growth
regime, significant dust segregation by size occurs, with large particles
moving towards dense regions while small particles remain in the diffuse
regions, and the mean radial drift of each dust species is appreciably altered
from the (initial) drag-force equilibrium. The former effect may skew the
spectral index derived from multi-wavelength observations and change the
initial size distribution of a pebble cloud for planetesimal formation. The
latter along with turbulent diffusion may influence the radial transport and
mixing of solid materials in young protoplanetary discs.

soon learned that these events also had enhancements in the abundances of
heavier elements, such as a factor of ~10 enhancements in Fe/O, which was later
seen to be part of a smooth increase in enhancements vs. mass-to-charge ratio
A/Q from H to Pb, rising by a factor of ~1000. These events were also

accelerated in islands of magnetic reconnection from plasma temperatures of 2 -
3 MK on open field lines in solar jets. Similar reconnection on closed loops
traps the energy of the particles to produce hot (>10 MK), bright flares.
Sometimes impulsive SEP intensities are boosted by shock waves when the jets
launch fast coronal mass ejections. No single theory yet explains both the
sharp resonance in 3He and the smooth increase up to heavier elements; two
processes seem to occur. Sometimes the efficient acceleration even exhausts the
rare 3He in the source region, limiting its fluence.

Existing solutions are costly and difficult to use, as they rely on
manually-customized artifacts such as protocol models, protocol parsers, and
learning frameworks. The aim of this work is to develop a greybox fuzzer
(StateaAFL) for network servers that only relies on lightweight analysis of the
target program, with no manual customization, in a similar way to what the AFL
fuzzer achieved for stateless programs. The proposed fuzzer instruments the
target server at compile-time, to insert probes on memory allocations and
network I/O operations. At run-time, it infers the current protocol state of
the target server by taking snapshots of long-lived memory areas, and by
applying a fuzzy hashing algorithm (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) to map memory
contents to a unique state identifier. The fuzzer incrementally builds a
protocol state machine for guiding fuzzing.
  We implemented and released StateaAFL as open-source software. As a basis for
reproducible experimentation, we integrated StateaAFL with a large set of
network servers for popular protocols, with no manual customization to
accomodate for the protocol. The experimental results show that the fuzzer can
be applied with no manual customization on a large set of network servers for
popular protocols, and that it can achieve comparable, or even better code
coverage and bug detection than customized fuzzing. Moreover, our qualitative
analysis shows that states inferred from memory better reflect the server
behavior than only using response codes from messages.

$L$-values for ${\rm GSp}_4 \times {\rm GL}_2$ can be expressed in terms of
these periods. In the case of Kim-Ramakrishnan-Shahidi lifts of ${\rm GL}_2$,
we establish period relations between the automorphic periods and powers of
Petersson norm of Hilbert modular forms. The conjecture for symmetric sixth
$L$-functions then follows from these period relations and our previous work on
the algebraicity of critical values for the adjoint $L$-functions for ${\rm

perpendicular to the previously known bipolar molecular outflow, that is
consistently traced by 20 lines of 8 molecular species with a range of
excitation temperatures, including complex organic molecules (COMs). Kinematic
modelling shows the data are well described by models that include a disc in
Keplerian rotation and infall, with an enclosed mass of $40-70
\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ (within a 2000 AU outer radius) for a disc inclination
angle of $i=40^{\circ}$, of which $5.4-7.2 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ is attributed to
the disc. Our new VLA observations show that the 6.7 GHz Class II methanol
masers associated with MM1 form a partial ellipse, consistent with an inclined
ring, with a velocity gradient consistent with that of the thermal gas. The
disc-to-star mass ratio suggests the disc is likely to be unstable and may be
fragmenting into as-yet-undetected low mass stellar companions. Modelling the
centimetre--millimetre spectral energy distribution of MM1 shows the ALMA 1.05
mm continuum emission is dominated by dust, whilst a free-free component,
interpreted as a hypercompact HII region, is required to explain the VLA
$\sim$5 cm emission. The high enclosed mass derived for a source with a
moderate bolometric luminosity ($\sim$10$^{4} \mathrm{L}_{\odot}$) suggests
that the MM1 disc may feed an unresolved high-mass binary system.

known system dynamics. To solve them, one typically resorts to robust
optimization methods. However, this significantly increases computational
complexity and limits scalability in both learning and planning. On the other
hand, regularized MDPs show more stability in policy learning without impairing
time complexity. Yet, they generally do not encompass uncertainty in the model
dynamics. In this work, we aim to learn robust MDPs using regularization. We
first show that regularized MDPs are a particular instance of robust MDPs with
uncertain reward. We thus establish that policy iteration on reward-robust MDPs
can have the same time complexity as on regularized MDPs. We further extend
this relationship to MDPs with uncertain transitions: this leads to a
regularization term with an additional dependence on the value function. We
finally generalize regularized MDPs to twice regularized MDPs (R${}^2$ MDPs),
i.e., MDPs with $\textit{both}$ value and policy regularization. The
corresponding Bellman operators enable developing policy iteration schemes with
convergence and robustness guarantees. It also reduces planning and learning in

composition, interior structure, and magnetic properties of stars. It is also
critical to the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets, in
particular those targeted in extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) searches,
which must contend with stellar variability that is often orders of magnitude
stronger than the planetary signal. One of the most successful methods to map
the surfaces of stars is Doppler imaging, in which the presence of
inhomogeneities is inferred from subtle line shape changes in high resolution
stellar spectra. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient, and closed-form
solution to the problem of Doppler imaging of stellar surfaces. Our model
explicitly allows for incomplete knowledge of the local (rest frame) stellar
spectrum, allowing one to learn differences from spectral templates while
simultaneously mapping the stellar surface. It therefore works on blended
lines, regions of the spectrum where line formation mechanisms are not well
understood, or stars whose spots have intrinsically different spectra from the
rest of the photosphere. We implement the model within the open source starry
framework, making it fast, differentiable, and easy to use in both optimization
and posterior inference settings. As a proof-of-concept, we use our model to
infer the surface map of the brown dwarf WISE 1049-5319B, finding close
agreement with the solution of Crossfield et al. (2014). We also discuss
Doppler imaging in the context of EPRV studies and describe an interpretable
spectral-temporal Gaussian process for stellar spectral variability that we
expect will be important for EPRV exoplanet searches.

Both the integral and the sum of monomial functions diverge to infinity for $s

otherwise. This paper presents analytic continuation of divergent integral of
monomial over the entire complex plane with the exception of the pole at one,
similar to analytic continuation of the zeta-function. It is shown that the
improper integral can be equivalently written in term of Dirichlet series by
making term-by-term integration of the monomial over successive integer
intervals and using the Newton's generalization of the binomial theorem. This
allows us to establish an elegant relationship between the $\mu$-function and
$\zeta$-function and a functional equation that are exploited to assign
meaningful solution to the divergent integral in the sense of analytic
continuation. Subsequently, it is proved that the $\mu$-function is holomorphic

self-training to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data for prompt-based FN
in few-shot settings. We use self-training in conjunction with meta-learning
for re-weighting noisy pseudo-prompt labels. Self-training is expensive as it
requires updating all the model parameters repetitively. Therefore, we use a
second technique for light-weight fine-tuning where we introduce a small number
of task-specific parameters that are fine-tuned during self-training while
keeping the PLM encoder frozen. Our experiments show that LiST can effectively
leverage unlabeled data to improve the model performance for few-shot learning.
Additionally, the fine-tuning is efficient as it only updates a small
percentage of parameters and the overall model footprint is reduced since
several tasks can share a common PLM encoder as backbone. A comprehensive study
on six NLU tasks demonstrate LiST to improve by 35% over classic fine-tuning
and 6% over prompt-based FN with 96% reduction in number of trainable

with diameters on the order of 1 m are identified and characterized in the flow
approaching a 2.5 MW wind turbine in the region spanning the bottom blade tip
elevation to hub height. Their impact on turbine structural loading, power
generation, and wake behaviour are evaluated. Long coherent structure packets
(larger than 200 m) are shown to increase fluctuating stresses on the turbine
support tower. Large inflow vortices interact with the turbine blades, leading
to deviations from the expected power generation. The sign of these deviations
is related to the rotation direction of the vortices, with rotation in the same
direction as the circulation on the blades leading to periods of power surplus,
and opposite rotation causing power deficit. Periods of power deficit coincide
with wake contraction events. These findings highlight the importance of

framework based on the S3PRL toolkit. In the context of recognition-synthesis
VC, self-supervised speech representation (S3R) is valuable in its potential to
replace the expensive supervised representation adopted by state-of-the-art VC
systems. Moreover, we claim that VC is a good probing task for S3R analysis. In
this work, we provide a series of in-depth analyses by benchmarking on the two
tasks in VCC2020, namely intra-/cross-lingual any-to-one (A2O) VC, as well as
an any-to-any (A2A) setting. We also provide comparisons between not only
different S3Rs but also top systems in VCC2020 with supervised representations.
Systematic objective and subjective evaluation were conducted, and we show that
S3R is comparable with VCC2020 top systems in the A2O setting in terms of
similarity, and achieves state-of-the-art in S3R-based A2A VC. We believe the
extensive analysis, as well as the toolkit itself, contribute to not only the
S3R community but also the VC community. The codebase is now open-sourced.

after the machine was upgraded to 12 GeV, the accelerator's beam energy

model accuracy for a variety of learning tasks when the high-quality supervised
data is severely limited. Although it is often established that the average
accuracy for the entire population of data is improved, it is unclear how SSL
fares with different sub-populations. Understanding the above question has
substantial fairness implications when different sub-populations are defined by
the demographic groups that we aim to treat fairly. In this paper, we reveal
the disparate impacts of deploying SSL: the sub-population who has a higher
baseline accuracy without using SSL (the ""rich"" one) tends to benefit more from
SSL; while the sub-population who suffers from a low baseline accuracy (the
""poor"" one) might even observe a performance drop after adding the SSL module.
We theoretically and empirically establish the above observation for a broad
family of SSL algorithms, which either explicitly or implicitly use an
auxiliary ""pseudo-label"". Experiments on a set of image and text classification
tasks confirm our claims. We introduce a new metric, Benefit Ratio, and promote
the evaluation of the fairness of SSL (Equalized Benefit Ratio). We further
discuss how the disparate impact can be mitigated. We hope our paper will alarm
the potential pitfall of using SSL and encourage a multifaceted evaluation of
future SSL algorithms.

impairs the generalization of deep neural networks (DNNs). It is critical to
find efficient ways to detect corrupted patterns. Current methods primarily
focus on designing robust training techniques to prevent DNNs from memorizing
corrupted patterns. These approaches often require customized training
processes and may overfit corrupted patterns, leading to a performance drop in
detection. In this paper, from a more data-centric perspective, we propose a
training-free solution to detect corrupted labels. Intuitively, ``closer''
instances are more likely to share the same clean label. Based on the
neighborhood information, we propose two methods: the first one uses ``local
voting"" via checking the noisy label consensuses of nearby features. The second
one is a ranking-based approach that scores each instance and filters out a
guaranteed number of instances that are likely to be corrupted. We
theoretically analyze how the quality of features affects the local voting and
provide guidelines for tuning neighborhood size. We also prove the worst-case
error bound for the ranking-based method. Experiments with both synthetic and
real-world label noise demonstrate our training-free solutions consistently and
significantly improve most of the training-based baselines. Code is available

realizing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications systems

the performance of SW-HBF in a wideband multi-carrier MIMO communication system
considering the beam squint effect. We aim at designing the switch-based
combiner that maximizes the system spectral efficiency (SE). However, the
design problem is challenging because the analog combing matrix elements are
binary variables. To overcome this, we propose tabu search-based (TS) SW-HBF
schemes that can attain near-optimal performance with reasonable computational
complexity. Furthermore, we compare the total power consumption and energy
efficiency (EE) of the SW-HBF architecture to those of the phase-shifter-based
hybrid beamforming (PS-HBF) architecture. Numerical simulations show that the
proposed algorithms can efficiently find near-optimal solutions. Moreover, the
SW-HBF scheme can significantly mitigate the beam squint effect and is less
affected by the number of subcarriers than PS-HBF. It also provides improved SE
and EE performance compared to PS-HBF schemes.

  through bubbly wake measurement","24 pages, 23 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The stability of ventilated supercavitation is strongly influenced by gas
leakage characteristics of the cavity. Here we conduct a systematic
investigation of such characteristics under different closure conditions
including re-entrant jet (RJ), quad vortex (QV), twin vortex (TV), and
pulsating twin vortex (PTV). Using high-speed digital inline holography (DIH),
all the individual bubbles shed from the cavity are imaged downstream and are
used to quantify the instantaneous gas leakage from the cavity. In general, the
supercavity gas leakage exhibits significant fluctuations under all closure
types with the instantaneous leakage rate spiking up to 20 times of the
ventilation input under RJ and QV closures. However, the magnitude and
occurrence rate of such excessive gas leakage vary substantially across
different closures, tunnel speeds, and ventilation conditions. Particularly, as
the supercavity transitions from RJ, to QV, TV, and PTV with increasing
ventilation or decreasing tunnel speed, the relative excessive gas leakage
decreases sharply from RJ to QV, plateaus from QV to TV, and drops again from
TV to PTV. Correspondingly, the occurrence frequency of such excessive leakage
first exhibits a double peak distribution under RJ, migrates to a single peak
mode under QV and TV, and eventually transitions to a distribution with a
broadened peak at a higher frequency under PTV. These trends can be explained
by the flow instabilities associated with three distinct gas leakage
mechanisms. Subsequently, two metrics are introduced to quantify the relative
change of ventilation needed to compensate for the change of extra gas loss and
the predictability of the occurrence of excessive gas leakage, respectively.
Based on these metrics, we suggest that the supercavity operating under TV
closure with moderate ventilation is optimal for ventilation-based controls of
supercavity stability.

of flare loops to calculate the spectral irradiance ranging from the X-rays
through the far ultraviolet (~ 0 to 1250 Angstroms), constrained by GOES/XRS
observations. We test this model against SDO/EVE data. The model spectra and
time evolution compares well in high temperature emission, but cooler lines
show large discrepancies. We speculate that the discrepancies are likely due to
both a non-uniform cross section of the flaring loops as well as opacity
effects. We then show that allowing the cross-sectional area to vary with
height significantly improves agreement with observations, and is therefore a
crucial parameter needed to accurately model the intensity of spectral lines,

paper, we study similar associations in the context of zigzag persistence. Our
main finding is a weak duality for the so-called non-repetitive zigzag
filtrations in which a simplex is never added again after being deleted. The
technique used to prove the duality for non-zigzag persistence does not extend
straightforwardly to our case. Accordingly, taking a different route, we prove
the weak duality by converting a non-repetitive filtration to an up-down
filtration by a sequence of diamond switches. We then show an application of
the weak duality result which gives a near-linear algorithm for computing the
$p$-th and a subset of the $(p-1)$-th persistence for a non-repetitive zigzag
filtration of a simplicial $p$-manifold. Utilizing the fact that a
non-repetitive filtration admits an up-down filtration as its canonical form,
we further reduce the problem of computing zigzag persistence for
non-repetitive filtrations to the problem of computing standard persistence for
which several efficient implementations exist. Our experiment shows that this
achieves substantial performance gain. Our study also identifies repetitive
filtrations as instances that fundamentally distinguish zigzag persistence from
the standard persistence.

commensurability. The width of second-order resonances increases with
increasing eccentricity, and thus more eccentric systems have a stronger peak
at commensurability when averaged over sufficient time. The libration period is
short enough that this time-averaging behavior is expected to appear on the
timescale of the Kepler mission. Using N-body integrations of simulated planet
pairs near the 5:3 and 3:1 mean-motion resonances, we investigate the
eccentricity distribution consistent with the planet pairs observed by Kepler.
This analysis, an approach independent from previous studies, shows no
statistically significant peak at the 3:1 resonance and a small peak at the 5:3

the eccentricity of the observed Kepler planets at $\sigma=0.245$ (3:1) and

5G new radio (NR) BS coverage area, with varying channel conditions. The

distributions with bounded support. The alternative hypothesis is a composite
set of Lipschitz continuous distributions that are at least $\varepsilon$ away
in $\ell_1$ distance from the uniform distribution. We propose a sequential
test that adapts to the unknown distribution under the alternative hypothesis.
Referred to as the Adaptive Binning Coincidence (ABC) test, the proposed
strategy adapts in two ways. First, it partitions the set of alternative
distributions into layers based on their distances to the uniform distribution.
It then sequentially eliminates the alternative distributions layer by layer in
decreasing distance to the uniform, and subsequently takes advantage of
favorable situations of a distant alternative by exiting early. Second, it
adapts, across layers of the alternative distributions, the resolution level of
the discretization for computing the coincidence statistic. The farther away
the layer is from the uniform, the coarser the discretization is needed for
eliminating/exiting this layer. It thus exits both early in the detection
process and quickly by using a lower resolution to take advantage of favorable
alternative distributions. The ABC test builds on a novel sequential
coincidence test for discrete distributions, which is of independent interest.
We establish the sample complexity of the proposed tests as well as a lower
bound.

Visual Servo (IBVS) controller that relies on sensing information from two
on-board cameras and an IMU. The maneuver is divided into two stages: crossing
the window and landing on the pad. For the first stage, a control law is
proposed that guarantees that the vehicle will not collide with the wall
containing the window and will go through the window with non-zero velocity
along the direction orthogonal to the window, keeping at all times a safety
distance with respect to the window edges. For the landing stage, the proposed
control law ensures that the vehicle achieves a smooth touchdown, keeping at
all time a positive height above the plane containing the landing pad. For
control purposes, the centroid vectors provided by the combination of the
spherical image measurements of a collection of landmarks (corners) for both
the window and the landing pad are used as position measurement. The
translational optical flow relative to the wall, window edges, and landing
plane is used as velocity cue. To achieve the proposed objective, no direct
measurements nor explicit estimate of position or velocity are required.
Simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the performance

sciences. One of the most fundamental questions for self-organizing swarms is
whether the swarms disperse or remain in a spatially cohesive configuration. In
the paper we study dissipativity properties and spatial cohesiveness of the
swarm of self-propelled particles governed by the model $\ddot r_k = -p_k(|\dot
r_k|)\dot r_k - \sum_m a_{k,m}r_m$, where $r_k\in \mathbb R^d$, $k=1,\ldots,n$,
and $A = \{a_{k,m}\}$ is a symmetric positive-semidefinie matrix. The
self-propulsion term is assumed to be continuously differentiable and to grow
faster than $1/z$, that is, $p_k(z)z\to\infty $ as $z\to\infty$. We establish
that the velocity and acceleration of the particles are ultimately bounded. We
show that when $\ker (A)$ is trivial, the positions of the particles are also
ultimately bounded. For systems with $\ker (A)\neq \{0\}$, we show that, while
the system might infinitely drift away from its initial location, the particles
remain within a bounded distance from the generalized center of mass of the
system, which geometrically coincides with the weighted average of agent
positions. The weights are determined by the coefficients of the projection
matrix onto $\ker (A)$. We also include the proof of the ultimate boundedness
of velocities and accelerations for systems with bounded coupling, including
systems coupled via the Morse potential.
  In our proof we switch to the velocity-acceleration coordinates and focus on
the study of dissipativity properties for a more general class of Li\'enard

The model is formulated explicitly in terms of quantities connected closely
with equation of state (EOS) theory, in particular the shear modulus and
Einstein temperature, which reduces the number of unconstrained parameters
while increasing the range of applicability. The least constrained component is
the Peierls barrier $E_P$, which is however accessible by atomistic
simulations. We demonstrate an efficient method to estimate the variation of
$E_P$ with compression, constrained to fit a single flow stress datum. The
formulation for dislocation mobility accounts for some or possibly all of the
stiffening at high strain rates usually attributed to phonon drag. The
configurational energy of the dislocations is accounted for explicitly, giving
a self-consistent calculation of the conversion of plastic work to heat. The
configurational energy is predicted to contribute to the mean pressure, and may
reach several percent in the terapascal range, which may be significant when
inferring scalar EOS data from dynamic loading experiments. The bulk elastic
strain energy also contributes to the pressure, but appears to be much smaller.
Although inherently describing the plastic relaxation of elastic strain, the
model can be manipulated to estimate the flow stress as a function of mass
density, temperature, and strain rate, which is convenient to compare with
other models and inferences from experiment. The deduced flow stress reproduces
systematic trends observed in elastic waves and instability growth experiments,
and makes testable predictions of trends versus material and crystal type over
a wide range of pressure and strain rate.

additional quantum resources. The $i$-QER predicts possible errors in a given
quantum circuit using supervised learning models. If the predicted error is
above a pre-specified threshold, it cuts the large quantum circuit into two
smaller sub-circuits using an error-influenced fragmentation strategy for the
first time to the best of our knowledge. The proposed fragmentation process is
iterated until the predicted error reaches below the threshold for each
sub-circuit. The sub-circuits are then executed on a quantum device. Classical
reconstruction of the outputs obtained from the sub-circuits can generate the
output of the complete circuit. Thus, $i$-QER also provides classical control

Temperature dependent, zero magnetic field, specific heat, electrical

series of antiferromagnetic phase transitions at T1 = 61.0 \pm 0.2 K, T2 = 56.5
\pm 0.2 K and T3 = 42.2 \pm 0.2 K. The three specific heat anomalies found at
these temperatures qualitatively have very small entropy changes associated
with them and the anisotropic M(H) data saturate at ~ 0.12 {\mu}B/Ni; both
observations strongly suggesting the AFM order is associated with very small,
itinerant, moments. Anisotropic, H||c and H{\perp}c, {\rho}(H) and M(H)
isotherms as well as constant field, {\rho}(T) and M(T) sweeps manifest
signatures of multiple phase lines and result in H-T phase diagrams that are
clearly anisotropic. Analysis of M(T) and M(H) data allow for the
identification of the two lower temperature magnetically ordered states as
antiferromagnetically ordered, with the moments aligned along the
crystallographic c-axis, and the higher temperature, T2 < T < T1, state as
having a finite ferromagnetic component. In addition, the metamagnetic
transition at low temperatures, for H applied along the crystallographic c-axis
(H||c) appears to be a near classic example of a spin-flop transition,
resulting in a field stabilized antiferromagnetic state with the moments
ordered perpendicular to the c-axis. Although the small moment ordering, and

tolerance $\epsilon>0$, the algorithm computes $\exp(tA)u_0$ with error bounded
by $\epsilon$. The algorithm is based on a combination of a regularized
functional calculus, suitable contour quadrature rules, and the adaptive
computation of resolvents in infinite dimensions. As a particular case, we show
that it is possible, even when only allowing pointwise evaluation of
coefficients, to compute, with error control, semigroups on the unbounded
domain $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ that are generated by partial differential operators
with polynomially bounded coefficients of locally bounded total variation. For
analytic semigroups (and more general Laplace transform inversion), we provide
a quadrature rule whose error decreases like $\exp(-cN/\log(N))$ for $N$
quadrature points, that remains stable as $N\rightarrow\infty$, and which is
also suitable for infinite-dimensional operators. Numerical examples are given,

represent the unification of the wave and the particle aspects of the

wave-like and particle-like contributions. However, in Jordan's treatment there
is no mention of the Planck distribution and all averages are performed with
respect to pure number states of radiation (mixed states had not yet been
discovered!). The chief reason why Jordan does reproduce Einstein's result
despite not using thermal states of radiation is that he focuses on
fluctuations in a small (compared to the whole) volume of the black body. The
state of radiation in a small volume is highly entangled to the rest of the
black body which leads to the correct fluctuations even though the overall
state might, in fact, be assumed to be pure (i.e. at zero temperature). I
present a simple derivation of the fluctuations formula as an instance of mixed
states being reductions of higher level pure states, a representation that is
affectionately known as ``Church of the Higher Hilbert Space"". According to
this view of mixed states, temperature is nothing but the amount of
entanglement between the system and its environment.

observe one to four spatial clusters at most locations. A detailed spatial

beamforming provides better spectral efficiency than spatial multiplexing in
the LOS scenario due to the boresight path, and two spatial streams usually
offer the highest spectral efficiency at most NLOS locations due to the limited

that has attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to its
equation-free structure, ability to easily identify coherent spatio-temporal
structures in data, and effectiveness in providing reasonably accurate
predictions for certain problems. Despite these successes, the application of
DMD to certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains
challenging. In such cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable
predictions but may indeed fail to recreate the data in which it was trained,
restricting its application to diagnostic purposes. For many problems in the
biological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a
compartmental framework, in which the transfer of mass within the system moves
within states. In these cases, the behavior of the system may not be accurately
recreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system, as proper
knowledge of the system dynamics, even for a single compartment, requires that
the behavior of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process. In
this work, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that, when performing
DMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure, one may recover
useful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting
compartment-wise. We also establish that important physical quantities, as mass
conservation, are maintained in the coupled-DMD extrapolation. The mathematical
and numerical analysis suggests that DMD may be a powerful tool when applied to
this common class of problems. In particular, we show interesting numerical
applications to a continuous delayed-SIRD model for Covid-19, and to a problem
from additive manufacturing considering a nonlinear temperature field and the
resulting change of material phase from powder, liquid, and solid states.

the diamond caustic of the lensing galaxy. This condition creates a
Malmquist-like selection effect in the population of observed quadruply lensed
quasars, increasing the true caustic area. The inferred areas are therefore
biased low by an amount proportional to the square of the uncertainty in the
natural logarithm of the area, $\sigma_{\ln{A}}$. The inferred time delays,
$\tau$, vary with the caustic area of the lensing galaxy as $\sqrt{A}$. As a
consequence, model time delays are biased low, leading to underestimates of the
Hubble constant. Classical Malmquist bias also plays a role, with inferred
magnifications biased low. As magnification is strongly anti-correlated with
the area of the caustic, this classical Malmquist bias has an effect opposite
to, but smaller than, the effect of the area bias. The overall effect is
estimated to be small (median bias of less than 1%), but has the potential to
be larger. Current posterior plots do not include caustic area, which limits
the capability to accurately estimate the bias. With anticipated increases in
sample sizes (in particular with the completion of LSST), correction for these

to enabling this capability is how to process and aggregate incrementally
observed local information among individual platforms, especially when their

posterior and perform weighted averaging of its parameters with those of its

measurements for the magnetic field of flux ropes are crucial for understanding
the triggering and energy release processes, yet they remain heretofore
elusive. Here we report microwave imaging spectroscopy observations of an
M1.4-class solar flare that occurred on 2017 September 6, using data obtained
by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array. This flare event is associated with a
partial eruption of a twisted filament observed in H{\alpha} by the Goode Solar
Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and
X-ray signatures of the event are generally consistent with the standard
scenario of eruptive flares, with the presence of double flare ribbons
connected by a bright flare arcade. Intriguingly, this partial eruption event
features a microwave counterpart, whose spatial and temporal evolution closely
follow the filament seen in H{\alpha} and EUV. The spectral properties of the
microwave source are consistent with nonthermal gyrosynchrotron radiation.
Using spatially resolved microwave spectral analysis, we derive the magnetic
field strength along the filament spine, which ranges from 600-1400 Gauss from
its apex to the legs. The results agree well with the non-linear force-free
magnetic model extrapolated from the pre-flare photospheric magnetogram. We
conclude that the microwave counterpart of the erupting filament is likely due
to flare-accelerated electrons injected into the filament-hosting magnetic flux
rope cavity following the newly reconnected magnetic field lines.

an opportunity to extend the functionalities of valleytronics devices. Very
short valley lifetimes demand the ultrafast control of valley pseudospin. Here,
we theoretically demonstrate the control of valley pseudospin in WSe2 monolayer
by single-cycle linearly polarized laser pulse. We use the asymmetric electric
field controlled by the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) to make the valley
polarization between K and K'-point in the Brillouin zone (BZ). Time-dependent
density functional theory with spin-orbit interaction reveals that no valley
asymmetry and its CEP dependence is observed within the linear-optical limit.
In the nonlinear-optical regime, linearly polarized pulse induces a high degree
of valley polarization and this polarization is robust against the field
strength. Valley polarization strongly depends and oscillates as a function of
CEP. The carrier density distribution forms nodes as the laser intensity
increases, our results indicate that the position of the carrier density in the
BZ can be controlled by the laser intensity. From the analysis by the massive
Dirac Hamiltonian model, the nodes of the carrier density can be attributed to
the Landau-Zener-St\""uckelberg interference of wave packets of the electron
wave function.

accurate depth estimation. Since 3D cost volume filtering is usually
memory-consuming, recurrent 2D cost map regularization has recently become
popular and has shown great potential in reconstructing 3D models of different

in the depth domain, which greatly limits the capability of capturing the
global scene context along the depth dimension. To tackle this limitation, we
propose a novel non-local recurrent regularization network for multi-view

capture non-local depth interactions within a sliding depth block. Then, the
global scene context between different blocks is modeled in a gated recurrent
manner. This way, the long-range dependencies along the depth dimension are
captured to facilitate the cost regularization. Moreover, we design a dynamic

favorable thermodynamically than adsorption on top of TLG. However,
intercalation into the gallery between TLG and BLG is most favorable. We obtain
energy barriers of about 1.3 eV and 2.3 eV for a H atom diffusing on and under

vicinity of a step on the TLG, we assess how readily one guest H atom on the
TLG terrace can directly penetrate the TLG into the gallery between TLG and BLG

mechanisms such as monetary incentives to buy delay time from their customers,

and the incentives should be jointly optimized accounting for the customers'
reactions. Against this backdrop, this paper presents an incentive-aware
electric vehicle routing scheme in which the fleet operator actively provides
incentives to the customers in exchange of pickup or delivery time flexibility.
Specifically, we first devise a bi-level model whereby the fleet operator
optimizes the routes and charging schedules of the fleet jointly with an
incentive rate to reimburse the delivery delays experienced by the customers.
At the same time, the customers choose the admissible delays by minimizing a
monetarily-weighted combination of the delays minus the reimbursement offered

reformulating the problem as a single-level optimization problem that can be
solved with standard mixed-integer linear programming algorithms. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework via extensive numerical

willing to share their data with differentially private systems. Further, we
attempt to understand (3) users' privacy expectations of the differentially
private systems they may encounter in practice and (4) their willingness to
share data in such systems. To answer these questions, we use a series of
rigorously conducted surveys (n=2424).
  We find that users care about the kinds of information leaks against which
differential privacy protects and are more willing to share their private
information when the risks of these leaks are less likely to happen.
Additionally, we find that the ways in which differential privacy is described
in-the-wild haphazardly set users' privacy expectations, which can be
misleading depending on the deployment. We synthesize our results into a
framework for understanding a user's willingness to share information with
differentially private systems, which takes into account the interaction
between the user's prior privacy concerns and how differential privacy is
described.

were built on top of different pre-trained Word Embedding representations,

pre-trained BETO model and a Recurrent Neural Network based on LSTM layers,
yielding an accuracy of up to 80%; nonetheless, a baseline model using a Random

flexibility to find the most adversarial probability distribution based on the
investor's desired degree of robustness. This allows us to derive robust
estimates to parametrize the distribution of asset returns without having to
impose any particular structure on the data. The resulting distributionally
robust optimization problem is a constrained convex-concave minimax problem.
Our approach is financially meaningful and attempts to attain full risk
diversification with respect to the worst-case instance of the portfolio risk

which blends projected gradient ascent with sequential convex programming. By
design, this algorithm is highly flexible and allows the user to choose among

Moreover, the algorithm is highly tractable and scalable. Our numerical

phase differences between these two instability modes. Three numerical methods
are used for a systematic approach for the entire transition process, i.e.,
before the onset of transition well into fully turbulent flow. The Floquet
analysis predicts the subharmonic resonance where a subharmonic mode locally
resonates for a given basic flow composed of the steady laminar flow and the
fundamental mode. Because the Floquet analysis is limited to the resonating
subharmonic mode, nonlinear parabolized stability equations (PSE) simulation is
conducted with various phase shifts of the subharmonic mode with respect to the
given fundamental mode. PSE offers insights on the modal interaction affected
by the phase difference up to the weakly nonlinear stage of transition.
Large-eddy simulation (LES) is conducted for a complete transition to turbulent

nonlinear stage of transition. The modulation of the subharmonic resonance with
the initial phase difference leads to a significant delay in the transition
location up to $\Delta Re_{x, tr} \simeq 4\times 10^5$ as predicted by the
current LES. Effects of the initial phase difference on the spatial evolution

a natural idea to construct a GNN based VFL framework, denoted as GVFL.
However, GNN has been proved vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Whether the
vulnerability will be brought into the GVFL has not been studied. This is the
first study of adversarial attacks on GVFL. A novel adversarial attack method
is proposed, named Graph-Fraudster. It generates adversarial perturbations
based on the noise-added global node embeddings via the privacy leakage and the
gradient of pairwise node. Specifically, first, Graph-Fraudster steals the
global node embeddings and sets up a shadow model of the server for the attack
generator. Second, noise is added into node embeddings to confuse the shadow

the guidance of noise-added node embeddings. Extensive experiments on five

  Optimization of Geometry and Spatial-Temporal Path Planning",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent research progress has confirmed that using advanced controls can
result in massive increases in energy capture for marine hydrokinetic (MHK)
energy systems, including ocean current turbines (OCTs) and wave energy
converters (WECs); however, to realize maximum benefits, the controls,
power-take-off system, and basic structure of the device must all be
co-designed from early stages. This paper presents an OCT turbine control
co-design framework, accounting for the plant geometry and spatial-temporal
path planning to optimize the performance. Developing a control co-design
framework means that it is now possible to evaluate the effects of changing
plant geometry on a level playing field when accounting for the OCT plant power
optimization. The investigated framework evaluates the key design parameters,
including the sizes of the generator, rotor, and variable buoyancy tank in the
OCT system, and formulates these parameters' effect on the OCT model and
harnessed power through defining a power-to-weight ratio, subject to the design
and operational constraints. The control co-design is formulated as a nested
optimization problem, where the outer loop optimizes the plant geometry and the
inner loop accounts for the spatial-temporal path planning to optimize the
harnessed power with respect to the linear model of the OCT system and ocean
current uncertainties. Compared with a baseline design, results verify the
efficacy of the proposed framework in co-designing an optimal OCT system to
gain the maximum power-to-weight ratio.

These stars formed in the warp (warp stars) must eventually settle into the
plane of the disc. We use an $N$-body$+$smooth particle hydrodynamics model of
a warped galaxy to study how warp stars settle into the disc. By following warp
stars in angular momentum space, we show that they first tilt to partially
align with the main disc in a time scale of $\sim1$ Gyr. Then, once
differential precession halts this process, they phase mix into an axisymmetric
distribution on a time scale of $\sim 6$ Gyr. The warp stars end up
contaminating the geometric thick disc. Because the warp in our fiducial
simulation is growing, the {\it warp stars} settle to a distribution with a
negative vertical age gradient as younger stars settle further from the
mid-plane. While vertically extended, warp star orbits are still nearly
circular and they are therefore subject to radial migration, with a net
movement inwards. As a result warp stars can be found throughout the disc. The
density distribution of a given population of warp stars evolves from a torus
to an increasingly centrally filled-in density distribution. Therefore we argue
that, in the Milky Way, warp stars should be found in the Solar Neighbourhood.
Moreover, settled warp stars may constitute part of the young flaring
population seen in the Milky Way's outskirts.

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and is an essential step of KG fusion. Current
mainstream methods -- neural EA models -- rely on training with seed alignment,
i.e., a set of pre-aligned entity pairs which are very costly to annotate. In
this paper, we devise a novel Active Learning (AL) framework for neural EA,
aiming to create highly informative seed alignment to obtain more effective EA
models with less annotation cost. Our framework tackles two main challenges
encountered when applying AL to EA: (1) How to exploit dependencies between
entities within the AL strategy. Most AL strategies assume that the data
instances to sample are independent and identically distributed. However,
entities in KGs are related. To address this challenge, we propose a
structure-aware uncertainty sampling strategy that can measure the uncertainty
of each entity as well as its impact on its neighbour entities in the KG. (2)
How to recognise entities that appear in one KG but not in the other KG (i.e.,
bachelors). Identifying bachelors would likely save annotation budget. To
address this challenge, we devise a bachelor recognizer paying attention to
alleviate the effect of sampling bias. Empirical results show that our proposed
AL strategy can significantly improve sampling quality with good generality
across different datasets, EA models and amount of bachelors.

since the traffic characteristics of different scenarios, it is very
challenging to train a unified model to serve all. Second, during the promotion
period, the exposure of some specific items will be re-weighted due to manual
intervention, resulting in biased logs, which will degrade the ranking model
trained using these biased data. In this paper, we propose a novel
Scenario-Aware Ranking Network (SAR-Net) to address these issues. SAR-Net
harvests the abundant data from different scenarios by learning users'
cross-scenario interests via two specific attention modules, which leverage the
scenario features and item features to modulate the user behavior features,
respectively. Then, taking the encoded features of previous module as input, a
scenario-specific linear transformation layer is adopted to further extract
scenario-specific features, followed by two groups of debias expert networks,
i.e., scenario-specific experts and scenario-shared experts. They output
intermediate results independently, which are further fused into the final
result by a multi-scenario gating module. In addition, to mitigate the data
fairness issue caused by manual intervention, we propose the concept of
Fairness Coefficient (FC) to measures the importance of individual sample and
use it to reweigh the prediction in the debias expert networks. Experiments on
an offline dataset covering over 80 million users and 1.55 million travel items

the rapid growth of the online fashion industry. However, recommending outfits
has two significant challenges that should be addressed. The first challenge is
that outfit recommendation often requires a complex and large model that
utilizes visual information, incurring huge memory and time costs. One natural
way to mitigate this problem is to compress such a cumbersome model with
knowledge distillation (KD) techniques that leverage knowledge from a
pretrained teacher model. However, it is hard to apply existing KD approaches
in recommender systems (RS) to the outfit recommendation because they require
the ranking of all possible outfits while the number of outfits grows
exponentially to the number of consisting clothing items. Therefore, we propose
a new KD framework for outfit recommendation, called False Negative
Distillation (FND), which exploits false-negative information from the teacher
model while not requiring the ranking of all candidates. The second challenge
is that the explosive number of outfit candidates amplifying the data sparsity
problem, often leading to poor outfit representation. To tackle this issue,
inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning (CL), we introduce a CL
framework for outfit representation learning with two proposed data
augmentation methods. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on outfit
recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and soundness of our

adaptive semantic segmentation without source data, which assumes that the
model is pre-trained on the source domain, and then adapting to the target
domain without accessing source data anymore. Since there is no supervision
from the source domain data, many self-training methods tend to fall into the
``winner-takes-all'' dilemma, where the {\it majority} classes totally dominate
the segmentation networks and the networks fail to classify the {\it minority}
classes. Consequently, we propose an effective framework for this challenging
problem with two components: positive learning and negative learning. In
positive learning, we select the class-balanced pseudo-labeled pixels with
intra-class threshold, while in negative learning, for each pixel, we
investigate which category the pixel does not belong to with the proposed
heuristic complementary label selection. Notably, our framework can be easily
implemented and incorporated with other methods to further enhance the

representations by conducting self-supervised training tasks on large-scale
corpora. Since PLMs capture word semantics in different contexts, the quality
of word representations highly depends on word frequency, which usually follows
a heavy-tailed distributions in the pre-training corpus. Therefore, the
embeddings of rare words on the tail are usually poorly optimized. In this
work, we focus on enhancing language model pre-training by leveraging
definitions of the rare words in dictionaries (e.g., Wiktionary). To
incorporate a rare word definition as a part of input, we fetch its definition
from the dictionary and append it to the end of the input text sequence. In
addition to training with the masked language modeling objective, we propose
two novel self-supervised pre-training tasks on word and sentence-level
alignment between input text sequence and rare word definitions to enhance
language modeling representation with dictionary. We evaluate the proposed
Dict-BERT model on the language understanding benchmark GLUE and eight
specialized domain benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Dict-BERT can significantly improve the understanding of rare words and boost
model performance on various NLP downstream tasks.

the ground state shows a stripe Neel order and the temperature dependence of
magnetic susceptibility follows that of the one-dimensional XXZ model with a
finite spin gap. We examine the nature of frustration by mapping the low energy
degenerate manifold of states to the fully packed loop-string model on a dual
cluster-depleted honeycomb lattice, finding that the order-by-disorder due to
quantum fluctuation characteristic of highly frustrated magnets is responsible
for the emergent stripes. The excited magnons split into two spinons and
propagate in the one-dimensional direction along the stripe which is
reminiscent of the XXZ or Ising model in one dimension. Unlike most of the
previously studied dimensional reduction effects, our case is purely
spontaneous as the interactions of the Hamiltonian retains a spatially
isotropic two-dimensional structure.

  dendrogramization",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Linear matrix factorizations (LMFs) such as independent component analysis
(ICA), principal component analysis (PCA), and their extensions, have been
widely used for finding relevant spatial maps in brain imaging data. The last
step of an LMF before interpretation is usually to extract the activated brain
regions from the map by thresholding. However, it is difficult to determine an
appropriate threshold level. Thresholding can remove the underlying properties
of spatial maps and their features imposed by the model. In this study, we
propose a threshold-free activated region extraction method which involves
simplifying a brain spatial map to a dendrogram through Morse filtration. Since
a dendrogram is related to the change of clustering structure in Rips
filtration, we first show the relationship between the Rips filtration of a
graph and the Morse filtration of a function. Then, we dendrogramize a spatial
map in order to visualize the activated brain regions and the range of their
importance in a spatial map. The proposed method can be applied to any spatial
maps that a user wants to threshold and interpret. In experiments, we applied
the proposed method to independent component maps (ICMs) obtained from
resting-state fMRI data, and the dominant subnetworks obtained by the PCA of a
correlation-based functional connectivity of FDG PET Alzheimer's disease
neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) data. We found that dendrogramization can help
to understand a brain spatial map without thresholding.

their explicit counterparts with limited depth while keeping the number of

of a good architecture and training scheme for MSS with DEQ is needed as the
characteristics of acoustic signals are different from those of natural

scheme for MSS with DEQ. Starting with the architecture of Open-Unmix (UMX), we
replace its sequence model with DEQ. We refer to our proposed method as
DEQ-based UMX (DEQ-UMX). Experimental results show that DEQ-UMX performs better
than the original UMX while reducing its number of parameters by 30%.

$\tilde{A}$, we quantify the early-time transmission of pre-existing
entanglement by calculating the leading order change in coherent information of
the complementary channel ($A\rightarrow B'$). We show that, when $A$ and $B$
are initially unentangled and $B$ is pure, there is no change in coherent
information to first order, while the leading (second) order change is
divergent. However, this divergence may be regulated by embedding the
conventional notion of coherent information into what we call the family of
$n$-coherent informations, defined using $n$-R\'enyi entropies. We find that
the rate of change of the $n$-coherent information at the onset of the
interaction is governed by a quantity, which we call the $n$-exposure, which
captures the extent to which the initial coherent information of $A$ with
$\tilde{A}$ is exposed to or `seen by' the interaction Hamiltonian between $A$
and $B$. We give examples in qubit systems and in the light-matter interaction.

For example, on the MNLI dataset we achieve an accuracy of $87.8\%$ using
RoBERTa-Large and $83.5\%$ using RoBERTa-Base with a privacy budget of
$\epsilon = 6.7$. In comparison, absent privacy constraints, RoBERTa-Large

  Imaging Tasks","6 Pages",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep Learning (DL) requires a large amount of training data to provide
quality outcomes. However, the field of medical imaging suffers from the lack
of sufficient data for properly training DL models because medical images
require manual labelling carried out by clinical experts thus the process is
time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. Recently, transfer learning (TL)
was introduced to reduce the need for the annotation procedure by means of
transferring the knowledge performed by a previous task and then fine-tuning
the result using a relatively small dataset. Nowadays, multiple classification
methods from medical imaging make use of TL from general-purpose pre-trained
models, e.g., ImageNet, which has been proven to be ineffective due to the
mismatch between the features learned from natural images (ImageNet) and those
more specific from medical images especially medical gray images such as
X-rays. ImageNet does not have grayscale images such as MRI, CT, and X-ray. In
this paper, we propose a novel DL model to be used for addressing
classification tasks of medical imaging, called MedNet. To do so, we aim to
issue two versions of MedNet. The first one is Gray-MedNet which will be
trained on 3M publicly available gray-scale medical images including MRI, CT,
X-ray, ultrasound, and PET. The second version is Color-MedNet which will be
trained on 3M publicly available color medical images including histopathology,
taken images, and many others. To validate the effectiveness MedNet, both
versions will be fine-tuned to train on the target tasks of a more reduced set
of medical images. MedNet performs as the pre-trained model to tackle any
real-world application from medical imaging and achieve the level of
generalization needed for dealing with medical imaging tasks, e.g.
classification. MedNet would serve the research community as a baseline for
future research.

models implies robustness against temporal corruptions; model corruption
robustness (especially robustness in the temporal domain) enhances with
computational cost and model capacity, which may contradict the current trend

visualized by an induced transient birefringence enabling direct probing of

distinguish correlated conduction mechanisms from a true random walk at the

of large datasets to make more accurate predictions than traditional algorithms
such as decision trees or k-nearest-neighbor better suited to describe simple
structures. While increased accuracy is often crucial, less complexity also has
value. This paper proposes a training data selection algorithm that identifies
multiple subsets with simple structures. A learning algorithm trained on such a
subset can classify an instance belonging to the subset with better accuracy
than the traditional learning algorithms. In other words, while existing
pattern recognition algorithms attempt to learn a global mapping function to
represent the entire dataset, we argue that an ensemble of simple local
patterns may better describe the data. Hence the sub-setting algorithm
identifies multiple subsets with simple local patterns by identifying similar
instances in the neighborhood of an instance. This motivation has similarities
to that of gradient boosted trees but focuses on the explainability of the
model that is missing for boosted trees. The proposed algorithm thus balances
accuracy and explainable machine learning by identifying a limited number of
subsets with simple structures. We applied the proposed algorithm to the
international stroke dataset to predict the probability of survival. Our
bottom-up sub-setting algorithm performed on an average 15% better than the
top-down decision tree learned on the entire dataset. The different decision
trees learned on the identified subsets use some of the previously unused
features by the whole dataset decision tree, and each subset represents a

phenomenon using the information bottleneck principle: the final layer of a
deep neural network, activated by the sigmoid or softmax activation functions,
causes an information bottleneck, and as a result, only a subset of the
task-relevant information is passed on to the output. We first support this
argument through a simulated toy experiment and then propose a method to reduce
the information bottleneck by removing the last activation function. In
addition, we introduce a new pooling method that further encourages the
transmission of information from non-discriminative regions to the
classification. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that this simple
modification significantly improves the quality of localization maps on both

probability vectors by directly applying this model, then utilizes Gaussian
distribution to fit for each class of probability vectors, and finally uses
separation degree on the Gaussian distributions to measure the target-related
knowledge of the materialized model. Moreover, we propose an improved
\textsf{MMQ} (\textsf{I-MMQ}), which significantly reduces the query time while
retaining the query performance of \textsf{MMQ}. Extensive experiments on a

reasonable. In contrast, ""Andrew was very drowsy, so he stayed up a long time,
now he is very alert"" does not comply with human common sense. Such reasoning
capability is essential for many downstream tasks, such as script reasoning,
abductive reasoning, narrative incoherence, story cloze test, etc. However,
conducting event correlation reasoning is challenging due to a lack of large
amounts of diverse event-based knowledge and difficulty in capturing
correlation among multiple events. In this paper, we propose EventBERT, a
pre-trained model to encapsulate eventuality knowledge from unlabeled text.
Specifically, we collect a large volume of training examples by identifying
natural language paragraphs that describe multiple correlated events and
further extracting event spans in an unsupervised manner. We then propose three
novel event- and correlation-based learning objectives to pre-train an event
correlation model on our created training corpus. Empirical results show
EventBERT outperforms strong baselines on four downstream tasks, and achieves
SoTA results on most of them. Besides, it outperforms existing pre-trained
models by a large margin, e.g., 6.5~23%, in zero-shot learning of these tasks.

contribute smaller gradients in back-propagation. However, we theoretically

Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect, which is a net torque
caused by solar radiation directly reflected and thermally reemitted from the
surface. Due to this effect, the rotation period slowly changes, which can be
most easily measured in light curves because the shift in the rotation phase
accumulates over time quadratically. We collected archived light curves and
carried out new photometric observations for asteroids (10115) 1992 SK, (1620)
Geographos, and (1685) Toro. We applied the method of light curve inversion to
fit observations with a convex shape model. The YORP effect was modeled as a
linear change of the rotation frequency $\upsilon \equiv \mathrm{d}\omega /
\mathrm{d}t$ and optimized together with other spin and shape parameters. We
detected the acceleration $\upsilon = (8.3 \pm 0.6) \times
10^{-8}\,\mathrm{rad}\,\mathrm{d}^{-2}$ of the rotation for asteroid (10115)
1992 SK. This observed value agrees well with the theoretical value of
YORP-induced spin-up computed for our shape and spin model. For (1685) Toro, we
obtained $\upsilon = (3.3 \pm 0.3) \times
10^{-9}\,\mathrm{rad}\,\mathrm{d}^{-2}$, which confirms an earlier tentative
YORP detection. For (1620) Geographos, we confirmed the previously detected
YORP acceleration and derived an updated value of $\upsilon$ with a smaller
uncertainty. We also included the effect of solar precession into our inversion
algorithm, and we show that there are hints of this effect in Geographos' data.
The detected change of the spin rate of (10115) 1992 SK has increased the total
number of asteroids with YORP detection to ten. In all ten cases, the
$\mathrm{d}\omega / \mathrm{d}t$ value is positive, so the rotation of these
asteroids is accelerated. It is unlikely to be just a statistical fluke, but it
is probably a real feature that needs to be explained.

detection (SOD), but are problematic in two aspects. 1) Indiscriminately
integrating the encoder feature, which contains spatial information for
multiple objects, and the decoder feature, which contains global information of
the salient object, is likely to convey unnecessary details of non-salient
objects to the decoder, hindering saliency detection. 2) To deal with ambiguous
object boundaries and generate accurate saliency maps, the model needs
additional branches, such as edge reconstructions, which leads to increasing
computational cost. To address the problems, we propose a context fusion
decoder network (CFDN) and near edge weighted loss (NEWLoss) function. The CFDN
creates an accurate saliency map by integrating global context information and
thus suppressing the influence of the unnecessary spatial information. NEWLoss
accelerates learning of obscure boundaries without additional modules by
generating weight maps on object boundaries. Our method is evaluated on four
benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We prove the
effectiveness of the proposed method through comparative experiments.

its intrinsic correlation with emotions are still obscure to researchers. This
work proposes four variant transformer frameworks~(spatial attention, temporal

spatial-temporal attention) for EEG emotion recognition to explore the
relationship between emotion and spatial-temporal EEG features. Specifically,
spatial attention and temporal attention are to learn the topological structure
information and time-varying EEG characteristics for emotion recognition
respectively. Sequential spatial-temporal attention does the spatial attention
within a one-second segment and temporal attention within one sample
sequentially to explore the influence degree of emotional stimulation on EEG
signals of diverse EEG electrodes in the same temporal segment. The
simultaneous spatial-temporal attention, whose spatial and temporal attention
are performed simultaneously, is used to model the relationship between
different spatial features in different time segments. The experimental results
demonstrate that simultaneous spatial-temporal attention leads to the best
emotion recognition accuracy among the design choices, indicating modeling the

neural networks. However, conventional quantization methods use the same
bit-width for all (or most of) the layers, which often suffer significant
accuracy degradation in the ultra-low precision regime and ignore the fact that
emergent hardware accelerators begin to support mixed-precision computation.
Consequently, we present a novel and principled framework to solve the
mixed-precision quantization problem in this paper. Briefly speaking, we first
formulate the mixed-precision quantization as a discrete constrained
optimization problem. Then, to make the optimization tractable, we approximate
the objective function with second-order Taylor expansion and propose an
efficient approach to compute its Hessian matrix. Finally, based on the above
simplification, we show that the original problem can be reformulated as a
Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP) and propose a greedy search algorithm
to solve it efficiently. Compared with existing mixed-precision quantization
works, our method is derived in a principled way and much more computationally
efficient. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset
and various kinds of network architectures also demonstrate its superiority
over existing uniform and mixed-precision quantization approaches.

considered. In the equilibrium-diffusion limit, the time scales of radiation

very small for the fully explicit scheme. An implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme is
applied, in which the hydrodynamic part is treated explicitly and the radiation

modified BGK equation, and the time dependent numerical fluxes can be obtained
by taking moments of gas distribution function. For the radiation diffusion

La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4 (Eu-LSCO) for doping contents across the pseudogap critical

can extract the spectral weight, K*, of the narrow Drude peak due the coherent
motion of the quasi-particles, and the spectral weight enclosed inside the
mid-infrared (MIR) band, KMIR, caused by coupling of the quasi-particles to
collective excitations of the many-body system. K* is smaller than a third of
the value predicted by band calculations, and KMIR forms a dome as a function
of doping. We observe a smooth doping dependence of K* through p*, and
demonstrate that this is consistent with the observed doping dependence of the
carrier density and the mass enhancement. We argue that the superconducting
dome is the result of the confluence of two opposite trends, namely the
increase of the density of the quasi-particles and the decrease of their
coupling to the collective excitations as a function of doping.

The BF measurements are carried out as two-dimensional differential correlators

$\Delta\varphi$ dependence of BFs is expected to be sensitive to the light

all pairs substantially decrease from peripheral to central collisions, the
longitudinal widths exhibit mixed behaviors: BFs of $\pi\pi$ and cross-species
pairs narrow significantly in more central collisions, whereas those of $\rm

dichotomy is qualitatively consistent with the presence of strong radial flow
effects and the existence of two stages of quark production in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions. Finally, the first measurements of the collision

charge balancing fractions are nearly independent of collision centrality in

DMD/Koopman modes through the prototypical subcritical free-shear flow over a

the ten most dominant modes. The results showed that the reduced-order
description is morphologically accurate and physically insightful. Mode 1
renders the mean-field. Modes 2 depicts the roll-up of the Strouhal vortex.
Mode 3 delineates the Bloor-Gerrard vortex resulting from the Kelvin-Helmholtz

and the concurrent flow entrainment. Modes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 portray the
harmonic excitation. Modes 6 and 10 describe the low-frequency shedding of
turbulent separation bubbles (TSBs) and turbulence production, respectively,

novel Koopman-based technique that effectively dissects high-dimensional
nonlinear systems into periodically distinct constituents on reduced-order
subspaces. As a novel mathematical hatchling, the DMD bears vast potentials yet
an equal degree of unknown. This serial effort investigates the nuances of DMD
sampling with an engineering-oriented emphasis. This Part I aimed at
elucidating how sampling range and resolution affect the convergence of DMD
modes. We employed the most classical nonlinear system in fluid mechanics as
the test subject--the turbulent free-shear flow over a prism--for optimal
pertinency. We numerically simulated the flow by the dynamic-stress
Large-Eddies Simulation with Near-Wall Resolution. With the large-quantity,
high-fidelity data, we parametrized and identified four global convergence
states: Initialization, Transition, Stabilization, and Divergence with
increasing sampling range. Results showed that the Stabilization is the optimal
state for modal convergence, in which DMD output becomes independent of the
sampling range. The Initialization state also yields sufficient accuracy for
most system reconstruction tasks. Moreover, defying popular beliefs,
over-sampling causes algorithmic instability: as the temporal dimension, n,
approaches and transcends the spatial dimension, m (i.e., m < n), the output
diverges and becomes meaningless. Additionally, the convergence of the sampling
resolution depends on the mode-specific dynamics, such that the resolution of
15 frames per cycle for target activities is suggested for most engineering
implementations. Finally, a bi-parametric study revealed that the convergence
of the sampling range and resolution are mutually independent.

sampling independence, too. Results also suggested that the observables derived

the DMD output. The static pressure and vortex identification criteria are
optimal variables for characterising structural response and fluid excitation.
The pressure, velocity magnitude, and turbulence kinetic energy fields also
suffice for general applications, but the Reynolds stresses and velocity
components shall be avoided. Mean-subtraction is recommended for best
approximations of the Koopman eigen tuples. Furthermore, the parametric
investigation on truncation discovered some low-energy states that dictate a
system's temporal integrity. The best practice for order reduction is to avoid
truncation and employ dominant mode selection on a full-state subspace, though
large-degree truncation supports fair data reconstruction with low
computational cost. Finally, this work demonstrated the synthetic noise
resulting from pre-decomposition interpolation. In unavoidable interpolations
to increase the spatial dimension n, high-order schemes are recommended for
better retention of the original dynamics. Finally, the observations herein,

transverse effects into account. We introduce the expansion order of the
electric field and Berry curvature multipole moment, where the Berry curvature
dipole is a particular one manifesting itself at the second harmonic order and
the second expansion order of the electric field. There are four cases with
conserving or breaking the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and inversion symmetry

breaking both symmetries, all harmonic order charge and spin currents are
nonzero. With conserving TRS and breaking IS, the charge Hall current exists at
even harmonic order, and the longitudinal charge current occurs at odd harmonic
order. Only the longitudinal spin current survives at even harmonic order. With
breaking TRS and conserving IS, only odd harmonic order charge and spin
currents can appear. Moreover, we observe that every harmonic order current

expressivity, which typically limits our capability to produce realistic
simulations, especially in the context of cancer evolution. We introduce the
Optimized Gillespie algorithm for simulating Stochastic sPAtial models of
Cancer Evolution (OG-SPACE), a computational framework for the simulation of
the spatio-temporal evolution of cancer subpopulations and of the experimental
procedures of both bulk andsingle-cell sequencing. OG-SPACE relies on an
evolution of the Gillespie algorithm optimized to deal with large numbers of
cells and is designed tohandle a variety of birth-death processes and
interaction rules on arbitrary lattices. As output OG-SPACE returns: the visual
snapshots of the spatial configuration of the system over time, the phylogeny
of the (sampled) cells, the mutational tree, the variant allele frequency
spectrum (for bulk experiments) and the cell genotypes (for single-cell
experiments).OG-SPACE is freely available

the future, as seen in the recently found superconductivity of twisted bilayer

can be rhombohedral, which shows flat bands near the Fermi level that are
associated with interesting phenomena, such as tunable conducting surface
states expected to exhibit spontaneous quantum Hall effect, surface
superconductivity, and even topological order. However, the difficulty in
exploring rhombohedral graphenes is that in experiments, the alternative,
hexagonal stacking is the most commonly found geometry and has been considered
the most stable configuration for many years. Here we reexamine this stability
issue in line with current ongoing studies in various laboratories. We
conducted a detailed investigation of the relative stability of trilayer
graphene stackings and showed how delicate this subject is. These few-layer
graphenes appear to have two basic stackings with similar energies. The
rhombohedral and Bernal stackings are selected using not only compressions but
anisotropic in-plane distortions. Furthermore, switching between stable
stackings is more clearly induced by deformations such as shear and breaking of
the symmetries between graphene sublattices, which can be accessed during
selective synthesis approaches. We seek a guide on how to better control -- by
preserving and changing -- the stackings in multilayer graphene samples.

probabilities are analogous to path liftings in geometry.
  The idea of lifting is modelled in terms of the category-theoretic concept of
a lens, which can be interpreted as a consistent choice of arrow liftings. The
category we study is the one of probability measures over a given standard
Borel space, with morphisms given by the couplings, or transport plans.
  The geometrical picture is even more apparent once we equip the arrows of the
category with weights, which one can interpret as ""lengths"" or ""costs"", forming
a so-called weighted category, which unifies several concepts of category
theory and metric geometry.
  Indeed, we show that the weighted version of a lens is tightly connected to
the notion of submetry in geometry.
  Every weighted category gives rise to a pseudo-quasimetric space via
optimization over the arrows. In particular, Wasserstein spaces can be obtained
from the weighted categories of probability measures and their couplings, with
the weight of a coupling given by its cost.
  In this case, conditionals allow one to form weighted lenses, which one can
interpret as ""lifting transport plans, while preserving their cost"".

one of the ingredients of the success of deep learning. ReLU activation has
been shown to mitigate the vanishing gradient issue, to encourage sparsity in

paper, we recognize that the non-linear behavior of the ReLU function gives
rise to a natural clustering when the pattern of active neurons is considered.
This observation helps to deepen the learning mechanism of the network; in
fact, we demonstrate that, within each cluster, the network can be fully
represented as an affine map. The consequence is that we are able to recover an
explanation, in the form of feature importance, for the predictions done by the
network to the instances belonging to the cluster. Therefore, the methodology

the model, without altering the structure of the network. A simulation study
and the empirical application to the Titanic dataset, show the capability of
the method to bridge the gap between the algorithm optimization and the human

attenuation and distortion cannot be explained by considering only the
dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) between Rydberg atoms in $|32D_{5/2}\rangle$.
Our observation can be attributed to the atoms in the dark Rydberg states other
than those in the bright Rydberg state, i.e., $|32D_{5/2}\rangle$, driven by
the coupling field. The dark Rydberg states are all the possible states, in
which the population decaying from $|32D_{5/2}\rangle$ accumulated over time,
and they were not driven by the coupling field. Consequently, the DDI between
the dark and bright Rydberg atoms increased the decoherence rate of the Rydberg
polaritons. We performed three different experiments to verify the above
hypothesis, to confirm the existence of the dark Rydberg states, and to measure
the decay rate from the bright to dark Rydberg states. In the theoretical
model, we included the decay process from the bright to dark Rydberg states and
the DDI effect induced by both the bright and dark Rydberg atoms. All the
experimental data of slow light taken at various probe Rabi frequencies were in
good agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the model. This study
pointed out an additional decoherence rate in the Rydberg-EIT effect, and

they are fed by frequency responses which are passed through different

learning, where no label is provided to the learning algorithm, leaving it

on numerous layers of artificial neural networks, which are computing systems
inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. In
asteroid dynamics, machine learning methods have been recently used to identify

asteroids in three-body resonances, among other applications. Here, we will
conduct a review of available literature in the field, and classify it in terms
of metrics recently used by other authors to assess the state of the art of
applications of machine learning in other astronomical subfields. For
comparison, applications of machine learning to Solar System bodies, a larger
area that includes imaging and spectrophotometry of small bodies, have already

methodologies are more established, and the use of ML led to the discovery of
new celestial objects or features. ML applied to asteroid dynamics, however, is
still in the emerging phase, with smaller groups, and fewer papers producing
discoveries. Large observational surveys, like those conducted at the Vera C.
Rubin Observatory, will produce very substantial datasets of orbital and
physical properties for asteroids. Applications of ML for clustering, image

ESG indicators that are most relevant when it comes to explaining the sovereign

such as economic strength and credit rating. We also emphasize the major themes
that are directly useful for investors when assessing the country risk premium.
At the global level, we notice that these themes mainly belong to the E and G
pillars. Those results confirm that extra-financial criteria are integrated
into bond pricing. However, we also identify a clear difference between
high-and middle-income countries. Indeed, whereas the S pillar is lagging for
the highest income countries, it is nearly as important as the G pillar for the
middle-income ones. Second, we determine which ESG metrics are indirectly
valuable for assessing a country's solvency. More precisely, we attempt to
infer credit rating solely from extra-financial criteria, that is the ESG
indicators that are priced in by credit rating agencies. We find that there is
no overlap between the set of indicators that predict credit ratings and those
that directly explain sovereign bond yields. The results also highlight the
importance of the G and S pillars when predicting credit ratings. The E pillar
is lagging, suggesting that credit rating agencies are undermining the impact
of climate change and environmental topics on country creditworthiness. This is
consistent with the traditional view that social and governance issues are the
main drivers of the sovereign risk, because they are more specific and less
global than environmental issues. Finally, taking these different results
together, this research shows that opposing extra-financial and fundamental
analysis does not make a lot of sense.

Detecting software partial failures in complex systems at runtime assist to
handle software unintended behaviors, avoiding catastrophic software failures

find the manifestation of faults before they finally lead to unavoidable
failures, thus supporting following runtime fault tolerant techniques. We
review the state of the art articles and find that the content failures account
for the majority of all kinds of software failures, but its detection methods
are rarely studied. In this work, we propose a novel failure detection
indicator based on the software runtime dynamic execution information for
software content failures. The runtime information is recorded during software
execution, then transformed to a measure named runtime entropy and finally fed
into machine learning models. The machine learning models are built to classify
the intended and unintended behaviors of the objected software systems. A
series of controlled experiments on several open source projects are conducted
to prove the feasibility of the method. We also evaluate the accuracy of
machine learning models built in this work.

current approaches in semi-supervised learning can decrease the required amount
of annotated data by a factor of 10 or even more, this line of research still
uses distinct classes. For underwater classification, and uncurated real-world
datasets in general, clean class boundaries can often not be given due to a
limited information content in the images and transitional stages of the

thus producing fuzzy labels which could also be considered ambiguous or
divergent. We propose a novel framework for handling semi-supervised
classifications of such fuzzy labels. It is based on the idea of overclustering
to detect substructures in these fuzzy labels. We propose a novel loss to
improve the overclustering capability of our framework and show the benefit of
overclustering for fuzzy labels. We show that our framework is superior to

with introducing two variants of contrastive losses to respectively facilitate
downstream classification and segmentation. To demonstrate the efficacy of our
method, we conduct experiments on three downstream tasks which are 3D object
classification (on ModelNet40 and ModelNet10), shape part segmentation (on
ShapeNet Part dataset) as well as scene segmentation (on S3DIS). Comprehensive
results show that our unsupervised contrastive representation learning enables
impressive outcomes in object classification and semantic segmentation. It
generally outperforms current unsupervised methods, and even achieves
comparable performance to supervised methods. Our source codes will be made

decade of dedicated study, their launching mechanisms and structure are still
not well understood, but variability techniques may provide useful constraints.
In this work, therefore, we perform a flux-resolved X-ray spectroscopy on a
highly accreting and variable NLS1 AGN, 1H 0707-495, using all archival
XMM-Newton observations to study the structure of the UFO. We find that the
wind spectral lines weaken at higher luminosities, most likely due to an
increasing ionization parameter as previously found in a few similar sources.
Instead, the velocity is anticorrelated with the luminosity, which is opposite
to the trend observed in the NLS1 IRAS 13224-3809. Furthermore, the detection
of the emission lines, which are not observed in IRAS 13224-3809, indicates a
wind with a larger opening angle in 1H 0707-495, presumably due to a higher
accretion rate. The emitting gas is found to remain broadly constant with the
luminosity. We describe the variability of the wind with a scenario where the
strong radiation extends the launch radius outwards and shields the outer
emitting gas, similarly to super-Eddington compact objects, although other
possible explanations are discussed. Our work provides several hints for a
multi-phase outflow in 1H 0707-495.

encoder-decoder-based methods achieve T-CAS often with a two-step method where
the information is passed between the encoder and decoder with a shared

potential approach to this problem is to design an end-to-end method by using a
dual generative adversarial network (DualGAN) without dimension reduction of
passing information, but it cannot realize one-to-one signal-to-signal

the transition signals are cascaded by the corresponding EEG and speech signals
in a certain proportion, which can build bridges for EEG and speech signals

rendering pipeline. Like other neural renderers, our system takes as input
calibrated camera images and a proxy geometry of the scene, in our case a point
cloud. To generate a novel view, the point cloud is rasterized with learned
feature vectors as colors and a deep neural network fills the remaining holes
and shades each output pixel. The rasterizer renders points as one-pixel
splats, which makes it very fast and allows us to compute gradients with
respect to all relevant input parameters efficiently. Furthermore, our pipeline
contains a fully differentiable physically-based photometric camera model,
including exposure, white balance, and a camera response function. Following
the idea of inverse rendering, we use our renderer to refine its input in order
to reduce inconsistencies and optimize the quality of its output. In
particular, we can optimize structural parameters like the camera pose, lens
distortions, point positions and features, and a neural environment map, but
also photometric parameters like camera response function, vignetting, and
per-image exposure and white balance. Because our pipeline includes photometric
parameters, e.g.~exposure and camera response function, our system can smoothly
handle input images with varying exposure and white balance, and generates
high-dynamic range output. We show that due to the improved input, we can
achieve high render quality, also for difficult input, e.g. with imperfect
camera calibrations, inaccurate proxy geometry, or varying exposure. As a
result, a simpler and thus faster deep neural network is sufficient for
reconstruction. In combination with the fast point rasterization, ADOP achieves
real-time rendering rates even for models with well over 100M points.

due to the fact that they interpret the underlying learning system through a

inclusion of many-body effects in van der Waals dispersion affects the outcome
of geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations of model polymers.
We find that delocalized force contributions are key to explore the
conformational landscape, as they induce an anisotropic polarization response
which efficiently guides the conformation towards globally optimized
structures. This is in contrast with the commonly used pair-wise approach,
where the atomic polarizabilities lack information on the global geometry. We
show that such local approximation causes the conformational search to be

the many-body formalism strongly reduces the roughness of the potential energy

to efficiently and robustly collect trolleys in dynamic and complex

method that combines object detection and keypoint estimation. Then, a docking
process in a short distance is achieved with an accurate point cloud plane
detection method and a novel manipulator design. On the planning side, we
formulate the robot's motion planning under a nonlinear model predictive

capabilities while maintaining the target in the sensors' field of view at

analytic optimization techniques can be adopted to rapidly maximize the

on two primary tuning parameters to optimize the uplink performance; (i) the
constellation altitude and (ii) the satellite antenna beamwidth. The framework
leverages tools from stochastic geometry to derive analytical models that
formulate a parametric uplink coverage problem which also includes user traffic
demand as an input. This allows operators to devise uplink expansion strategies
to cater for expanding user demand. The framework demonstrates that fine-tuning
of these parameters can significantly enhance the network capacity. We show
that the optimization of random constellations provides a close match to that

select candidate keyphrases based on the similarity between learned

multi-tasking OSes as well as event-driven user applications. Normally, the OS
assists the user application by lifting the semantics of exceptions received
from hardware to program-friendly user signals and exception handling
interfaces. However, can exception handlers work securely in user enclaves,
such as those enabled by Intel SGX, where the OS is not trusted by the enclave
code?
  In this paper, we introduce a new attack called SmashEx which exploits the
OS-enclave interface for asynchronous exceptions in SGX. It demonstrates the
importance of a fundamental property of safe atomic execution that is required
on this interface. In the absence of atomicity, we show that asynchronous
exception handling in SGX enclaves is complicated and prone to re-entrancy
vulnerabilities. Our attacks do not assume any memory errors in the enclave
code, side channels, or application-specific logic flaws. We concretely
demonstrate exploits that cause arbitrary disclosure of enclave private memory
and code-reuse (ROP) attacks in the enclave. We show reliable exploits on two
widely-used SGX runtimes, Intel SGX SDK and Microsoft Open Enclave, running
OpenSSL and cURL libraries respectively. We tested a total of 14 frameworks,
including Intel SGX SDK and Microsoft Open Enclave, 10 of which are vulnerable.
We discuss how the vulnerability manifests on both SGX1-based and SGX2-based
platforms. We present potential mitigation and long-term defenses for SmashEx.

advent of active arrays and passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)
that are physically large, it is plausible that the transmitter or receiver is
located in between the Fraunhofer distance of the individual array/surface

configured to reflect the incident waveform towards a point in the radiative

conventional angular beam with infinity focus, which only results in
amplification in the far-field. To understand when these different options are
viable, an accurate characterization of the near-field behaviors is necessary.

from classical physics. It is the backbone of quantum information processing
which relies on engineered quantum systems. It also exists in natural systems
such as atoms and molecules, showcased in many experimental instances mostly in
the form of entangled photon pairs and a few examples of entanglement between
massive particles. Nevertheless, the control of entanglement in natural systems
has never been demonstrated. In artificially prepared quantum systems, on the
other hand, the creation and manipulation of entanglement lies at the heart of
quantum computing currently implemented in a wide array of two-level systems
(e.g. trapped ions, superconducting and semiconductor systems). These processes
are, however, relatively slow: the time scale of the entanglement generation
and control ranges from a couple of {\mu}s in case of trapped-ion quantum
systems down to tens of ns in superconducting systems. In this letter, we show
ultrafast optical control of entanglement between massive fundamental particles
in a natural system on a time scale faster than that available to engineered
systems. We demonstrate the sub-femtosecond control of electronic entangled
states in a single hydrogen molecule by applying few-photon interactions with
adjustable relative delays. This molecular entanglement is revealed in the
asymmetric electron emission with respect to the ejected proton in the
photodissociation of H2. We anticipate that these results open the way to
entanglement-based operations at THz speed.

involving three or more quadratic residues (or quadratic non-residues) modulo

established similar results in the number field case. However, we exhibit some
examples of races in function fields where LI is false, and where the
associated densities vanish, or behave differently than in the number field

interest in the last decade. However, only a few recently-reported approaches
are capable of directly generating vector glyphs and their results are still
far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel method, DeepVecFont,
to effectively resolve this problem. Using our method, for the first time,
visually-pleasing vector glyphs whose quality and compactness are both
comparable to human-designed ones can be automatically generated. The key idea
of our DeepVecFont is to adopt the techniques of image synthesis, sequence
modeling and differentiable rasterization to exhaustively exploit the
dual-modality information (i.e., raster images and vector outlines) of vector
fonts. The highlights of this paper are threefold. First, we design a
dual-modality learning strategy which utilizes both image-aspect and
sequence-aspect features of fonts to synthesize vector glyphs. Second, we
provide a new generative paradigm to handle unstructured data (e.g., vector
glyphs) by randomly sampling plausible synthesis results to get the optimal one
which is further refined under the guidance of generated structured data (e.g.,
glyph images). Finally, qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on a
publicly-available dataset demonstrate that our method obtains high-quality
synthesis results in the applications of vector font generation and
interpolation, significantly outperforming the state of the art.

fixed audio clip and across similar audio clips. To address this problem, we
propose an adversarial training framework for audio captioning based on a

naturalness and diversity of generated captions. Unlike processing data of
continuous values in a classical GAN, a sentence is composed of discrete tokens
and the discrete sampling process is non-differentiable. To address this issue,
policy gradient, a reinforcement learning technique, is used to back-propagate
the reward to the generator. The results show that our proposed model can
generate more diverse captions, as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

survival probability of such RWs when the traps are periodically distributed
and separated by a distance $L$. We obtain exact results for the mean
first-passage time and the survival probability in the special case of a
double-sided exponential jump distribution. While such RWs typically survive
longer than if they could not leap over traps, their survival probability still
decreases exponentially with the number of steps. The decay rate of the
survival probability depends in a non-trivial way on the trap length $\ell$ and
exhibits an interesting regime when $\ell\rightarrow 0$ as it tends to the
ratio $\ell/L$, which is reminiscent of strongly chaotic deterministic systems.
We generalize our model to continuous-time RWs, where we introduce a power-law
distributed waiting time before each jump. In this case, we find that the

expressions for the amplitude and the differential cross section are derived
analytically by adopting the Furry picture approach in which the calculations
are carried out using exact relativistic Dirac-Volkov functions. We begin by
studying the process taking into account the relativistic dressing of only the
electron without muon. Then, in order to reveal the effect of the muon
dressing, we fully consider the relativistic dressing of the electron and muon
together in the initial and final states. As a result, the differential cross
section is significantly reduced by the laser field. We find that the effect of
laser-dressing of muon becomes noticeable at laser field strengths greater than
or equal to $10^{9}~\text{V cm}^{-1}$ and therefore must be taken into account.
The influence of the laser field strength and frequency on the differential
cross section and multiphoton process is revealed. An insightful comparison
with the laser-free results is also included.17

underlying time scales in the near-wall region of the neutrally stratified
atmospheric boundary layer in the presence of a vegetation canopy. This is
achieved through an empirical analysis of the persistence time scales (periods
between successive zero-crossings) of momentum flux events, and their
connection to the ejection-sweep cycle. Using high-frequency measurements from
the GoAmazon campaign, spanning multiple heights within and above a dense
canopy, the analysis suggests that when the persistence time scales ($t_p$) of
momentum flux events from four different quadrants are separately normalized by
$\Gamma_{w}$ (integral time scale of the vertical velocity), their
distributions ($P(t_p/\Gamma_{w})$) remain height-invariant. This result points
to a persistent memory imposed by canopy-induced coherent structures, and to
their role as an efficient momentum transport mechanism between the canopy
airspace and the region immediately above. Moreover, $P(t_p/\Gamma_{w})$
exhibits a power-law scaling at times $t_{p}<\Gamma_{w}$ with an exponential
tail appearing for $t_{p} \geq \Gamma_{w}$. By separating the flux events based
on $t_p$, we discover that around 80\% of the momentum is transported through
the long-lived events ($t_{p} \geq \Gamma_{w}$) at heights immediately above
the canopy while the short-lived ones ($t_{p} < \Gamma_{w}$) only contribute
marginally ($\approx$ 20\%). To explain the role of instantaneous flux
amplitudes towards momentum transport, we compare the measurements with a
newly-developed surrogate data and establish that the range of time scales
involved with amplitude variations in the fluxes tend to increase as one
transitions from within to above the canopy.

for one or two separated lead singers. In particular, we introduced three
models for the singer separation task and designed an automatic model selection
scheme to distinguish how many lead singers are in the song. We also collected
a large enough data set, MIR-SingerSeparation, which has been publicly released
to advance the frontier of this research. Our singer separation is most
suitable for sentimental ballads and can be directly applied to karaoke content
generation. As far as we know, this is the first singer-separation work for
real-world karaoke applications.

inserted in a coherently superposed channel, superposing two paths offered to a
probe qubit across the noisy unitary, and driven by a control qubit. A
characterization is performed of the transformation realized by the superposed
channel on the joint state of the probe-control qubit pair. The superposed
channel is then specifically analyzed for the fundamental metrological task of
phase estimation on the noisy unitary, with the performance assessed by the
Fisher information, classical or quantum. A comparison is made with
conventional estimation techniques and also with a quantum switched channel
with indefinite causal order recently investigated for a similar task of phase
estimation. In the analysis here, a first important observation is that the
control qubit of the superposed channel, although it never directly interacts
with the unitary being estimated, can nevertheless be measured alone for
effective estimation, while discarding the probe qubit that interacts with the
unitary. This property is also present with the switched channel but is
inaccessible with conventional techniques. The optimal measurement of the
control qubit here is characterized in general conditions. A second important
observation is that the noise plays an essential role in coupling the control
qubit to the unitary, and that the control qubit remains operative for phase
estimation at very strong noise, even with a fully depolarizing noise, whereas
conventional estimation and the switched channel become inoperative in these
conditions. The results extend the analysis of the capabilities of coherently
controlled channels which represent novel devices exploitable for quantum

question. With the evolution of complex surfaces, quantification and prediction
of these forces become intricate. Nevertheless, understanding these forces is
highly relevant for explaining liquid transport in nature and establishing
design guidelines for manmade interfaces. Here, it is shown that the adhesion
of droplets is highly sensitive to the directionality of chemical
heterogeneities. Asymmetric biphilic surfaces, with hydrophilic triangular
patches and superhydrophobic surrounding, impose direction-dependent adhesion.
This dependency is quantified by bending beam experiments, in which a droplet
is dragged on the surface in two opposite directions. In addition, force
calculation derived from droplet roll-off experiments reveal accordant trends.
The lower the aspect ratio, the higher the difference of adhesion forces
between the two directions. The shape of the fluid contact line on the biphilic
surfaces elucidates the origin of the direction-dependent adhesion. Namely, the
droplet receding part pins to a higher number of patches when moving toward to
apex in comparison to the opposite direction. When the triangular patches are
more slender, this asymmetry cancels. These findings improve the understanding
of droplet adhesion to biphilic surfaces particularly, and surfaces with
wetting heterogeneities in general.

Similar cycles
are found in other stars as well, but their details are not known to a similar

understanding of the stellar and solar dynamos that are driving the magnetic
activity. We present spectropolarimetric observations of five young, solar-type
stars, and compare them to previous observations, with the aim to identify and
characterise stellar equivalents of the solar cycle. We use Zeeman-Doppler
imaging (ZDI) to map the surface magnetic field and brightness of our targets.
The magnetic field is decomposed into spherical harmonic expansions, from which
we report the strengths of the axisymmetric vs. non-axisymmetric, and poloidal
vs. toroidal components, and compare them to the Rossby numbers of the stars.
We present five new ZDI-maps of young, solar-type stars from Dec 2017. Of
special interest is the case of V1358 Ori, that has gone through a polarity
reversal between our observations and earlier ones. A less evident polarity
reversal might also have occurred in HD 35296. There is a preference for more
axisymmetric field, and possibly more toroidal field, for the more active stars
with lower Rossby number, but a larger sample should be studied to draw any
strong conclusions from this. For most of the individual stars, the amounts of
toroidal and poloidal field have stayed on similar levels as in earlier
observations. We find evidence for a magnetic polarity reversal having occurred
in V1358 Ori. \c{hi}1 Ori could be an interesting target for future
observations, with a possible short magnetic cycle of a few years. The
correlation between the brightness maps and the magnetic field is mostly poor,
which could indicate the presence of small-scale magnetic features of different
polarities, that cancel each other out, and are not resolved in our maps.

addition, complex background and scale changes make it difficult to improve

representation network for object detection in aerial images (RelationRS): 1)
Firstly, multi-scale features are fused and enhanced by a dual relationship
module (DRM) with conditional convolution. The dual relationship module learns
the potential relationship between features of different scales and learns the
relationship between different scenes from different patches in a same
iteration. In addition, the dual relationship module dynamically generates
parameters to guide the fusion of multi-scale features. 2) Secondly, The
bridging visual representations module (BVR) is introduced into the field of
aerial images to improve the object detection effect in images with complex
backgrounds. Experiments with a publicly available object detection dataset for
aerial images demonstrate that the proposed RelationRS achieves a
state-of-the-art detection performance.

formed at the dead-zone inner edge in the early phase of the protosolar disk
evolution, where the disk is effectively heated by the disk accretion. First,
we compute the dust evolution in a gas disk with a dead zone and obtain the
spatial distribution of rocky planetesimals. The disk is allowed to evolve both
by a viscous diffusion and magnetically-driven winds. We find that the rocky
planetesimals are formed in concentrations around $\sim$ 1 au with a total mass
comparable to the mass of the current inner solar system in the early phase of
the disk evolution within $\lesssim0.1$ Myr. Based on the planetesimal
distribution and the gas disk structure, we subsequently perform
\textit{N}-body simulations of protoplanets to investigate the dynamical
configuration of the planetary system. We find that the protoplanets can grow
into planets without significant orbital migration because of the rapid
clearing of the inner disk by the magnetically-driven disk winds. Our model can
explain the origins of the orbital structure of the inner solar system. Several
other features such as the rocky composition can also be explained by the early

distributions of pure states in an unsupervised manner. Our model assumes each
pure state generates data from a multivariate normal distribution, and
characterizes transitions between states via displacement-interpolation
specified by the Wasserstein barycenter. The system state is represented by a
barycentric weight vector which evolves over time via a random walk on the
simplex. Parameter learning leverages the natural Riemannian geometry of
Gaussian distributions under the Wasserstein distance, which leads to improved
convergence speeds. Experiments on several human activity datasets show that
our proposed DWB model accurately learns the generating distribution of pure

  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac2f9c",,"physics.plasm-ph physics.space-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Electron velocity distributions in the solar wind are known to have
field-aligned skewness, which has been characterized by the presence of
secondary populations such as the halo and strahl. Skewness may provide energy
for the excitation of electromagnetic instabilities, such as the whistler
heat-flux instability (WHFI), that may play an important role in regulating the
electron heat-flux in the solar wind. Here we use kinetic theory to analyze the
stability of the WHFI in a solar-wind-like plasma where solar wind core, halo
and strahl electrons are described as a superposition of two distributions: a
Maxwellian core, and another population modeled by a Kappa distribution to
which an asymmetry term has been added, representing the halo and also the
strahl. Considering distributions with small skewness we solve the dispersion
relation for the parallel propagating whistler-mode and study its linear
stability for different plasma parameters. Our results show that the WHFI can
develop in this system, and provide stability thresholds for this instability,
as a function of the electron beta and the parallel electron heat-flux, to be
compared with observational data. However, since different plasma states, with
different stability level to the WHFI, can have the same moment heat-flux
value, it is the skewness (i.e. the asymmetry of the distribution along the
magnetic field), and not the heat-flux, the best indicator of instabilities.
Thus, systems with high heat-flux can be stable enough to WHFI, so that it is
not clear if the instability can effectively regulate the heat-flux values
through wave-particle interactions.

revolution deep learning has brought about in the past decade. When solving
difficult problems in a datadriven manner, a well-tried approach is to take an
architecture discovered by renowned deep learning scientists as a basis (e.g.
Inception) and try to apply it to a specific problem. This might be sufficient,
but as of now, achieving very high accuracy on a complex or yet unsolved task
requires the knowledge of highly-trained deep learning experts. In this work,
we would like to contribute to the area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML),
specifically Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which intends to make deep
learning methods available for a wider range of society by designing neural
topologies automatically. Although several different approaches exist (e.g.
gradient-based or evolutionary algorithms), our focus is on one of the most
promising research directions, reinforcement learning. In this scenario, a
recurrent neural network (controller) is trained to create problem-specific
neural network architectures (child). The validation accuracies of the child
networks serve as a reward signal for training the controller with
reinforcement learning. The basis of our proposed work is Efficient Neural
Architecture Search (ENAS), where parameter sharing is applied among the child
networks. ENAS, like many other RL-based algorithms, emphasize the learning of
child networks as increasing their convergence result in a denser reward signal
for the controller, therefore significantly reducing training times. The
controller was originally trained with REINFORCE. In our research, we propose
to modify this to a more modern and complex algorithm, PPO, which has
demonstrated to be faster and more stable in other environments. Then, we
briefly discuss and evaluate our results.

experiments with similar distributions of training and testing data, the DNNs'
generalization ability is limited under the cross-domain scenarios with
different distributions of training and testing data. To improve the
generalization ability, recent hybrid methods have been explored to extract
task-aware handcrafted features (e.g., Local Binary Pattern) as discriminative
information for the input of DNNs. However, the handcrafted feature extraction
relies on experts' domain knowledge, and how to choose appropriate handcrafted
features is underexplored. To this end, we propose a learnable network to
extract Meta Pattern (MP) in our learning-to-learn framework. By replacing
handcrafted features with the MP, the discriminative information from MP is
capable of learning a more generalized model. Moreover, we devise a two-stream
network to hierarchically fuse the input RGB image and the extracted MP by
using our proposed Hierarchical Fusion Module (HFM). We conduct comprehensive
experiments and show that our MP outperforms the compared handcrafted features.
Also, our proposed method with HFM and the MP can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on two different domain generalization evaluation benchmarks.

Mathematically, the springback penalty is a weakly convex function. It bears
various theoretical and computational advantages of both the benchmark convex

studied in the literature. We establish the exact and stable recovery theory
for the recovery model using the springback penalty for both sparse and nearly

difference-of-convex algorithm. In particular, we show its theoretical
superiority to some existing models with a sharper recovery bound for some

regardless of the varying coherence of the sensing matrix. The springback

computational tractability, and numerical robustness for ill-conditioned

on the mutual update of a finite set $\mathcal{A}_k$ of extremal points of the
unit ball of the regularizer and of an iterate $u_k \in
\operatorname{cone}(\mathcal{A}_k)$. Each iteration requires the solution of
one linear problem to update $\mathcal{A}_k$ and of one finite dimensional
convex minimization problem to update the iterate. Under standard hypotheses on
the minimization problem we show that the algorithm converges sublinearly to a
solution. Subsequently, imposing additional assumptions on the associated dual
variables, this is improved to a linear rate of convergence. The proof of both
results relies on two key observations: First, we prove the equivalence of the
considered problem to the minimization of a lifted functional over a particular
space of Radon measures using Choquet's theorem. Second, the FC-GCG algorithm
is connected to a Primal-Dual-Active-point Method (PDAP) on the lifted problem

understanding, and perhaps to predicting and avoiding them. Little research has
been done to predict defects on the basis of the cognitive errors that cause
them. This paper proposes an approach to predicting software defects through
knowledge about the cognitive mechanisms of human errors. Our theory is that
the main process behind a software defect is that an error-prone scenario
triggers human error modes, which psychologists have observed to recur across
diverse activities. Software defects can then be predicted by identifying such
scenarios, guided by this knowledge of typical error modes. The proposed idea
emphasizes predicting the exact location and form of a possible defect. We
conducted two case studies to demonstrate and validate this approach, with 55
programmers in a programming competition and 5 analysts serving as the users of
the approach. We found it impressive that the approach was able to predict, at
the requirement phase, the exact locations and forms of 7 out of the 22 (31.8%)
specific types of defects that were found in the code. The defects predicted
tended to be common defects: their occurrences constituted 75.7% of the total
number of defects in the 55 developed programs; each of them was introduced by
at least two persons. The fraction of the defects introduced by a programmer
that were predicted was on average (over all programmers) 75%. Furthermore,
these predicted defects were highly persistent through the debugging process.
If the prediction had been used to successfully prevent these defects, this
could have saved 46.2% of the debugging iterations. This excellent capability
of forecasting the exact locations and forms of possible defects at the early
phases of software development recommends the approach for substantial benefits
to defect prevention and early detection.

splitters, active optical switchers or WDM; high dimensional-multipartite
entanglement and flexible reconfigurable multipartite networks. Both satellite

their relative merits are discussed. Current technology falls short in several
respects of what is required to address use cases well. Bit rates as a function
of distance are currently limited by the characteristics of available devices
and are an order of magnitude or more below the theoretical bounds. Non-ideal
device behaviour can open loopholes for side-channel attacks. Limited range
constrains network geometry. New techniques are being developed to overcome
these problems. The more sophisticated schemes depend on ongoing advances in
the generation and distribution of entanglement. Particularly promising are the
measurement device independent protocol, which eliminates photon-detector
related security weaknesses, and the twin-field protocol, which uses similar
techniques to extend range, in principle even beyond previously accepted
theoretical bounds. Agreement of keys between more than two users can be
accomplished classically after pairwise quantum key exchange but direct quantum
multipartite agreement using may offer advantages. The same applies to secret
sharing. Practical quantum repeaters, to eliminate the need for trusted nodes,
are closer to being realised due to recent progress in optical memories.

different nonlinearities and covariate correlations. Some Monte Carlo findings

function, which may fall short in characterizing data samples that arrive
sequentially in time-critical applications. To enable {\it online} kernel
adaptation, the present work advocates an incremental ensemble (IE-) GP
framework, where an EGP meta-learner employs an {\it ensemble} of GP learners,

each GP expert leveraging the random feature-based approximation to perform
online prediction and model update with {\it scalability}, the EGP meta-learner
capitalizes on data-adaptive weights to synthesize the per-expert predictions.
Further, the novel IE-GP is generalized to accommodate time-varying functions
by modeling structured dynamics at the EGP meta-learner and within each GP
learner. To benchmark the performance of IE-GP and its dynamic variant in the
adversarial setting where the modeling assumptions are violated, rigorous
performance analysis has been conducted via the notion of regret, as the norm
in online convex optimization. Last but not the least, online unsupervised
learning for dimensionality reduction is explored under the novel IE-GP

that human travel can be highly non-homogeneous with power-law scaling

the extent of variability in time and space when traveling the same air
distance has not been addressed so far. Using taxi data from five large cities,
we focus on several novel measures of distance and time to explore the
spatio-temporal variations of taxi travel routes relative to their typical
routes during peak and nonpeak periods. To compare all trips using a single
measure, we calculate the distributions of the ratios between actual travel
distances and the average travel distance as well as between actual travel
times and the average travel time for all origin destinations (OD) during peak
and nonpeak periods. In this way, we measure the scaling of the distribution of
all single trip paths with respect to their mean trip path. Our results
surprisingly demonstrate very broad distributions for both the distance ratio
and time ratio, characterized by a long-tail power-law distribution. Moreover,
all analyzed cities have larger exponents in peak hours than in nonpeak hours.
We suggest that the interesting results of shorter trip lengths and times,
characterized by larger exponents during rush hours, are due to the higher

(ST-VSR), which can increase the spatial resolution and frame rate for a given
video simultaneously. Despite the remarkable progress of recent methods, most
of them still suffer from high computational costs and inefficient long-range
information usage. To alleviate these problems, we propose a Bidirectional
Recurrence Network (BRN) with the optical-flow-reuse strategy to better use
temporal knowledge from long-range neighboring frames for high-efficiency
reconstruction. Specifically, an efficient and memory-saving multi-frame motion
utilization strategy is proposed by reusing the intermediate flow of adjacent
frames, which considerably reduces the computation burden of frame alignment
compared with traditional LSTM-based designs. In addition, the proposed hidden
state in BRN is updated by the reused optical flow and refined by the Feature
Refinement Module (FRM) for further optimization. Moreover, by utilizing
intermediate flow estimation, the proposed method can inference non-linear
motion and restore details better. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
optical-flow-reuse-based bidirectional recurrent network (OFR-BRN) is superior
to state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.

the massive number of connected users, such that more data and users can be

first propose an iterative suboptimal algorithm to provide an offline

ability to measure or estimate the physical capacity of humans in real-time. In
this work, we propose an algorithm for the feasibility set analysis of a
generic class of linear algebra problems. This novel iterative convex-hull

method is capable of running in real-time and allows the user to define the

demonstrated in a Collaborative carrying experiment, where a human operator and
a Franka Emika Panda robot jointly carry a 7kg object. The robot is controlled
in accordance to the AAN paradigm maintaining the load carried by the human

goods to a given set of customers. In this work, we investigate the potential
use of a quantum computer to find approximate solutions to the HVRP using the
quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). For this purpose we
formulate a mapping of the HVRP to an Ising Hamiltonian and simulate the
algorithm on problem instances of up to 21 qubits. We find that the number of
qubits needed for this mapping scales quadratically with the number of
customers. We compare the performance of different classical optimizers in the
QAOA for varying problem size of the HVRP, finding a trade-off between

to accomplish tasks that, separately, cannot be easily accomplished. Trust
between robots and humans in HATs is vital to task completion and effective
team cohesion. For optimal performance and safety of human operators in HRI,
human trust should be adjusted to the actual performance and reliability of the
robotic system. The cost of poor trust calibration in HRI, is at a minimum, low
performance, and at higher levels it causes human injury or critical task
failures. While the role of trust calibration is vital to team cohesion it is
also important for a robot to be able to assess whether or not a human is
exhibiting signs of mistrust due to some other factor such as anger,
distraction or frustration. In these situations the robot chooses not to
calibrate trust, instead the robot chooses to respect trust. The decision to
respect trust is determined by the robots knowledge of whether or not a human
should trust the robot based on its actions(successes and failures) and its
feedback to the human. We show that the feedback in the form of trust
calibration cues(TCCs) can effectively change the trust level in humans. This

objects located in more observationally accessible regions of the sky, HVSs
offer insight into the stellar population in the inner parsecs of the Milky
Way. We perform a suite of simulations ejecting stars from the GC, exploring
how detectable HVS populations depend on assumptions concerning the GC stellar
population, focusing on HVSs which would appear in current and/or future data
releases from the \textit{Gaia} space mission with precise astrometry and
measured radial velocities. We show that predictions are sensitive to two
parameters in particular: the shape of the stellar initial mass function (IMF)
in the GC and the ejection rate of HVSs. The absence of confident HVS
candidates in \textit{Gaia} Data Release 2 excludes scenarios in which the HVS
ejection rate is $\gtrsim3\times10^{-2} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. Stricter
constraints will be placed on these parameters when more HVS candidates are
unearthed in future \textit{Gaia} data releases -- assuming recent
determinations of the GC IMF shape, one confident HVS \textit{at minimum} is
expected in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and DR4 as long as the HVS ejection rate is
greater than $\sim 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and $\sim10^{-5} \,
\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, respectively.

Verifying the robustness of classifiers using the Wasserstein metric can be
achieved by proving the absence of adversarial examples (certification) or
proving their presence (attack). In this work we present a framework based on
the work by Levine and Feizi, which allows us to transfer existing
certification methods for convex polytopes or $L_1$-balls to the Wasserstein

mimicking effects of some interactions with other stars through which blue
straggler stars are thought to be born. We have constructed a non-standard
model of the star with the following parameters: $M=1.36M_{\odot}$,
$Y_{\mathrm{init}}=0.26$, $Z_{\mathrm{init}}=0.002$, and
$f_{\mathrm{ovs}}=0.027$, where $f_{\mathrm{ovs}}$ is the extent of
overshooting described as an exponentially decaying diffusive process. The
modification is down to the depth of $r/R\sim0.6$ and the extent $\Delta X$,
which is a difference in surface hydrogen abundance between the
envelope-modified and unmodified models, is $0.06$. The residuals between the
model and the observed frequencies are comparable with those for the previous
models computed assuming standard single-star evolution, suggesting that it is
possible that the star was born with an relatively ordinary initial helium
abundance of $\sim0.26$ compared with that of the previous models
($\sim0.30$--$0.40$), then experienced some modification of the chemical
compositions, and gained helium in the envelope. Detailed analyses of the
non-standard model have implied that the elemental diffusion in the deep
radiative region of the star might be much weaker than that assumed in current
stellar evolutionary calculations; we need some extra mechanisms inside the
star, rendering the star a much more intriguing target to be further
investigated.

both processes focusing on simple examples that are helpful for the
non-specialist and for classroom teaching. We describe relevant theory for ion
and water transport and the coupling with theory for chemical and mechanical
equilibrium on membrane/solution interfaces. For RO of neutral solutes, we
explain the solution-friction (SF) model which is closely related to the
classical sieving or pore flow model. The SF model includes advection,
diffusion, and solute partitioning, and leads to simple relationships for the
coupled fluxes of water and solutes (and thus for solute retention as well),

this theory is extended to describe RO for symmetric salt solutions with
charged membranes. For the desalination of salt solutions, both for RO and ED
we present two-dimensional module-scale calculations which lead to a
characteristic curve that determines optimum operational conditions based on a
simple cost calculation that offsets energy and material costs. We discuss the
two-fluid model (TFM) that comprehensively describes ion and water flow both in
RO and ED, and we explain how this theory also accurately describes osmosis
experiments where water and ions run in opposite directions through a membrane.

robustness. However, the progress is usually hampered by insufficient
robustness evaluations. As the de facto standard to evaluate adversarial
robustness, adversarial attacks typically solve an optimization problem of
crafting adversarial examples with an iterative process. In this work, we
propose a Model-Agnostic Meta-Attack (MAMA) approach to discover stronger
attack algorithms automatically. Our method learns the optimizer in adversarial
attacks parameterized by a recurrent neural network, which is trained over a
class of data samples and defenses to produce effective update directions
during adversarial example generation. Furthermore, we develop a model-agnostic
training algorithm to improve the generalization ability of the learned
optimizer when attacking unseen defenses. Our approach can be flexibly
incorporated with various attacks and consistently improves the performance
with little extra computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the learned attacks by MAMA compared to the state-of-the-art
attacks on different defenses, leading to a more reliable evaluation of
adversarial robustness.

(2) annotate/tag the outliers by type? Outlier detection has a large
literature, yet we find a key gap in the field: to our knowledge, no existing
work addresses the outlier annotation problem. Outliers are broadly classified
into 3 types, representing distinct patterns that could be valuable to
analysts: (a) global outliers are severe yet isolate cases that do not repeat,
e.g., a data collection error; (b) local outliers diverge from their peers
within a context, e.g., a particularly short basketball player; and (c)
collective outliers are isolated micro-clusters that may indicate coalition or
repetitions, e.g., frauds that exploit the same loophole. This paper presents
C-AllOut: a novel and effective outlier detector that annotates outliers by
type. It is parameter-free and scalable, besides working only with pairwise
similarities (or distances) when it is needed. We show that C-AllOut achieves
on par or significantly better performance than state-of-the-art detectors when
spotting outliers regardless of their type. It is also highly effective in
annotating outliers of particular types, a task that none of the baselines can

We aim to expand our understanding of radio wave emission and
propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere by studying the polarization of
drifting sub-pulses in highly sensitive observations of PSR~B1919+21 recorded
at the Arecibo Observatory.
  Methods. We apply and compare several methods of analysis and visualization,
including eigenvalue analysis of the longitude-resolved covariances between the
Stokes parameters; longitude-resolved scatter plots of the normalised Stokes
vectors in the Poincar\'e sphere; auto- and cross-correlations between the
Stokes parameters as a function of offset in pulse longitude and lag in pulse
number; and mean drift bands of polarization state, formed by averaging the
Stokes parameters and quantities derived from them synchronously with the
drifting sub-pulse modulation period.
  Results. We observe regions of pulse longitude where the superposition of
orthogonally polarised modes is best described as incoherent and regions where
the superposition appears to be at least partially coherent. Within the region
of coherent superposition, over a range of pulse longitudes spanning $\sim
2\circ$, the distribution of the Stokes polarization vectors forms a torus
centered near the origin of the Poincar\'e sphere. Furthermore, the
polarization vectors rotate about the axis of revolution of the torus
synchronously with the drifting sub-pulse modulation of the total intensity.
  Conclusions. The nearly uniform circular modulation of polarization state,
clearly evident in both the toroidal distribution of the Stokes polarization
vectors and the mean drift bands of the Stokes parameters, is not predicted by
current theoretical models of pulsar emission. We propose different scenarios
to explain the generation of the torus, based on either incoherent or
phase-coherent superposition of orthogonally polarised modes.

\ W m^{-2} K^{-4}$ the SB constant, firstly estimated by Stefan to within $11$
per cent of the actual value. The law is a pillar of modern physics since its
microscopic derivation implies the quantization of the energy related to the
electromagnetic field. Somewhat astonishing, Boltzmann presented his derivation
in 1878 making use only of electrodynamic and thermodynamic classical concepts,
apparently without introducing any quantum hypothesis (here called first
Boltzmann paradox). By using Planck (1901) quantization of the radiation field
in terms of a gas of photons, the SB law received a microscopic interpretation
providing also the value of the SB constant on the basis of a set of universal
constants including the quantum action constant $h$. However, the successive
consideration by Planck (1912) of the zero-point energy contribution was found
to be responsible of another divergence of the radiation energy-density for the
single photon mode at high frequencies. This divergence is of pure quantum
origin and is responsible for a vacuum-catastrophe, to keep the analogy with
the well-known ultraviolet catastrophe of the classical black-body radiation
spectrum, given by the Rayleigh-Jeans law in 1900. As a consequence, from a
rigorous quantum-mechanical derivation we expect the divergence of the SB law
(here called second Boltzmann paradox). In this paper we revisit the SB law by
accounting for genuine quantum effects associated with Planck energy
quantization and Casimir size quantization thus resolving both Boltzmann
