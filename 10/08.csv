exchange field on the band structure of centrosymmetric films of noble metals

$\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory, a minimal effective model is developed that
describes two coupled copies of a Rashba or Dirac electronic system residing at
the opposite surfaces of the film. The coupling leads to a structural gap at
$\bar{\Gamma}$ and causes an exotic redistribution of the spin density in the
film when the exchange field is introduced. We apply the model to a
nineteen-layer Au(111) film and to a five-quintuple-layer Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film. We
demonstrate that at each film surface the exchange field induces spectrum
distortions similar to those known for Rashba or Dirac surface states with an
important difference due to the coupling: At some energies, one branch of the
state loses its counterpart with the oppositely directed group velocity. This
suggests that a large-angle electron scattering between the film surfaces
through the interior of the film is dominant or even the only possible for such
energies. The spin-density redistribution accompanying the loss of the
counterpart favors this scattering channel.

performances and comfort, but above all, to help facing climate change. Despite
their success, their cost is still a challenge. One of the most expensive
components of EVs is lithium-ion batteries, which became the standard for
energy storage in a wide range of applications. Precisely estimating the
Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of battery packs can open to their reuse and thus
help to reduce the cost of EVs and improve sustainability. A correct RUL
estimation can be used to quantify the residual market value of the battery
pack. The customer can then decide to sell the battery when it still has a
value, i.e., before it exceeds its end of life of the target application and
can still be reused in a second domain without compromising safety and
reliability. In this paper, we propose to use a Deep Learning approach based on
LSTMs and Autoencoders to estimate the RUL of li-ion batteries. Compared to
what has been proposed so far in the literature, we employ measures to ensure
the applicability of the method also in the real deployed application. Such
measures include (1) avoid using non-measurable variables as input, (2) employ
appropriate datasets with wide variability and different conditions, (3) do not
use cycles to define the RUL.

gravitational interaction between OCs in primordial groups is very weak, and
the probability of gravitational capture of two unrelated OCs without
disruption is very low. We test such postulate through four different studies
using a manual search of Gaia EDR3 and extensive literature. First, we revisit
the work of de La Fuente Marcos & de La Fuente Marcos (2009), which states that
only ca. 40% of the OCs pairs are of primordial origin. However, no plausible
binary system among their proposed OC pairs having at least one member older
than 0.1 Gyr has been found. Second, we research among the youngest OCs (age <
0.01 Gyr) in Tarricq et al. (2021) and obtain that ca. 71% of them remain in
their primordial groups. Third, a similar study of the oldest OCs (age > 4 Gyr)
shows that they are essentially alone. Forth, the well-known case of the double
cluster in Perseus is shown also to accommodate the title hypothesis. A
simplified bimodal model allows retrieving the overall fraction of linked OCs
(around 12-16 %) from our results, assuming that young clusters remain
associated ~0.04 Gyr. The obtained results further support that OCs are born in

unsupervised machine learning was used to extract partial PDFs from the

allowed key insights not only into the local average composition, as validated

require energy filters on the instrument. We spatially map different quantities
of interest (QoI's), defined as scalars that can be computed directly from
positions and widths of ePDF peaks or parameters refined from fits to the

approach are explored and described in detail. Because of the fact that we are

-- the deflection of high-energy particles and jets toward the direction of a
flowing medium -- to the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions.
While the physics of jet drift is quite general, for specificity we consider
the case of photon-jet production at mid-rapidity. Beginning with the simplest
possible model, a large slab of uniformly flowing plasma, we systematically
introduce the geometrical elements of a heavy-ion collision in a simple optical
Glauber model. We find that the moving medium causes the jet to drift in the
direction of the flow, bending its trajectory and leaving detailed signatures
of the flow pattern in the distribution of $\gamma + \: \mathrm{jet}$
acoplanarities. In the elliptical geometries produced in non-central
collisions, this drift effect leads to a strong geometry coupling which
persists despite the addition of event-by-event fluctuations in the jet
production point, impact parameter, and acoplanarity. We propose a new
observable to measure the jet drift effect through the correlation of $\gamma +
\: \mathrm{jet}$ acoplanarities with the elliptic flow of soft particles.
Preliminary estimates suggest this correlation may be studied at sPHENIX and
the LHC.

correlation function of biased tracers is related to the initial one by a
convolution. For Gaussian initial conditions, the smearing kernel is Gaussian,
so if the initial correlation function is parametrized using simple polynomials
then the evolved correlation function is a sum of generalized Laguerre
functions of half-integer order. This motivates an analytic Laguerre
reconstruction algorithm which previous work has shown is fast and accurate.
This reconstruction requires as input the width of the smearing kernel. We show
that the method can be extended to estimate the width of the smearing kernel
from the same dataset. This estimate, and associated uncertainties, can then be
used to marginalize over the distribution of reconstructed shapes, and hence
provide error estimates on the value of the distance scale which are not tied
to a particular cosmological model. We also show that if, instead, we
parametrize the evolved correlation function using simple polynomials, then the
initial one is a sum of Hermite polynomials, again enabling fast and accurate
deconvolution. If one is willing to use constraints on the smearing scale from
other datasets, then marginalizing over its value is simpler for Hermite
reconstruction, potentially providing further speed-up in cosmological
analyses.

properties of human vision into the design of CNN architectures, leading to
perceptually more relevant saliency prediction. Due to the inherent inductive
biases of CNN architectures, there is a lack of sufficient long-range

capturing properties that emulate viewing behaviour of humans. Transformers
have shown great potential in encoding long-range information by leveraging the
self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel saliency model that
integrates transformer components to CNNs to capture the long-range contextual

added value to saliency prediction, enhancing its perceptual relevance in the

is similar to that of the previous solar minimum (Solar Cycle 24/25 compared to
23/24) but elevated compared to the past (Solar Cycle 20/21). The findings are
generally consistent with the current trend of unusually weak solar modulation

find a strong radial intensity gradient: 49.4 +/- 8.0 %/au from 0.1 to 0.94 au,

work that manipulates the latent representations of image generators to create

First, we observe that feature-level attacks provide useful classes of inputs

are uniquely versatile and highly robust. We demonstrate that they can be used
to produce targeted, universal, disguised, physically-realizable, and black-box

be used as a practical interpretability tool for identifying bugs in networks.
We use these adversaries to make predictions about spurious associations
between features and classes which we then test by designing ""copy/paste""
attacks in which one natural image is pasted into another to cause a targeted
misclassification. Our results suggest that feature-level attacks are a
promising approach for rigorous interpretability research. They support the

Tensor Renormalization Group (HOTRG) applied to a $d$-dimensional $( d \geq 2
)$ simple lattice model. Sequential computation of the HOTRG requires $O (
\chi^{4 d - 1} )$ computational cost, where $\chi$ is bond dimension, in a step
to contract indices of tensors. When we simply distribute elements of a local
tensor to each process in parallel computing of the HOTRG, frequent
communication between processes occurs. The simplest way to avoid such
communication is to hold all the tensor elements in each process, however, it
requires $O ( \chi^{2d} )$ memory space. In the presented method, placement of
a local tensor element to more than one process is accepted and sufficient
local tensor elements are distributed to each process to avoid communication
between processes during considering computation step. For the bottleneck part
of computational cost, such distribution is achieved by distributing elements
of two local tensors to $\chi^2$ processes according to one of the indices of
each local tensor which are not contracted during considering computation. In
the case of $d \geq 3$, computational cost in each process is reduced to $O (
\chi^{4 d - 3} )$ and memory space requirement in each process is kept to be $O
( \chi^{2d - 1} )$.

adopt a siamese dual-encoder architecture to encode queries and documents
independently for fast indexing and searching, while neglecting the
finer-grained term-wise interactions. This results in a sub-optimal recall
performance. Second, their model training highly relies on a negative sampling
technique to build up the negative documents in their contrastive losses. To
address these challenges, we present Adversarial Retriever-Ranker (AR2), which
consists of a dual-encoder retriever plus a cross-encoder ranker. The two
models are jointly optimized according to a minimax adversarial objective: the
retriever learns to retrieve negative documents to cheat the ranker, while the
ranker learns to rank a collection of candidates including both the
ground-truth and the retrieved ones, as well as providing progressive direct
feedback to the dual-encoder retriever. Through this adversarial game, the
retriever gradually produces harder negative documents to train a better
ranker, whereas the cross-encoder ranker provides progressive feedback to
improve retriever. We evaluate AR2 on three benchmarks. Experimental results
show that AR2 consistently and significantly outperforms existing dense
retriever methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them.

pose a formidable challenge being the climate system multiscale,

to the presence of a low-dimensional manifold containing the high-dimensional
climate trajectory that could make the problem more tractable. Here we argue
that reproducing the geometrical and topological properties of the
low-dimensional attractor should be a key target for models used in climate
projections. In doing so, we propose a general data-driven framework to
characterize the climate attractor and showcase it in the tropical Pacific
ocean using a reanalysis as observational proxy and two state-of-the-art
models. The analysis spans four variables simultaneously over the periods
1979-2019 and 2060-2100. At each time t, the system can be uniquely described
by a state space vector parameterized by N variables and their spatial
variability. The dynamics is confined on a manifold with dimension lower than
the full state space that we characterize through manifold learning algorithms,
both linear and nonlinear. The local geometry and local stability of the
high-dimensional, multi-variable climate attractor are quantified through the
local dimension and persistence metrics. Model biases that hamper climate
predictability are identified and found to be similar in the multivariate
attractor of the two models during the historical period while diverging under
the warming scenario considered. Finally, the relationships between different
sub-spaces (univariate fields), and therefore among climate variables, are
evaluated. The proposed framework provides a comprehensive, physically based,
test for assessing climate feedbacks and opens new avenues for improving their
model representation.

customizing school schedules, in addition, school schedules can differently

schedules had a higher maximum number of students infected, compared to

developments in the field of causal inference, it is not widely-known in the
NLP community. In this work, we argue that the causal direction of the data
collection process bears nontrivial implications that can explain a number of
published NLP findings, such as differences in semi-supervised learning (SSL)
and domain adaptation (DA) performance across different settings. We categorize
common NLP tasks according to their causal direction and empirically assay the
validity of the ICM principle for text data using minimum description length.
We conduct an extensive meta-analysis of over 100 published SSL and 30 DA
studies, and find that the results are consistent with our expectations based
on causal insights. This work presents the first attempt to analyze the ICM
principle in NLP, and provides constructive suggestions for future modeling
choices. Code available at https://github.com/zhijing-jin/icm4nlp

differentially rotating deformed radiation zones in stars and planets by
generalising the traditional approximation of rotation (TAR). The TAR treatment
was built on the assumptions that the star is spherical and uniformly rotating.
However, it has been generalised in our previous work by including the effects
of the centrifugal deformation using a non-perturbative approach in the
uniformly rotating case. We aim to carry out a new generalisation of the TAR
treatment to account for the differential rotation and the strong centrifugal
deformation simultaneously. We generalise our previous work by taking into
account the differential rotation in the derivation of our complete analytical
formalism that allows the study of the dynamics of GIWs in differentially and
rapidly rotating stars. We derived the complete set of equations that
generalises the TAR, simultaneously taking the full centrifugal acceleration
and the differential rotation into account. Within the validity domain of the
TAR, we derived a generalised Laplace tidal equation for the horizontal
eigenfunctions and asymptotic wave periods of the GIWs, which can be used to
probe the structure and dynamics of differentially rotating deformed stars with
asteroseismology. A new generalisation of the TAR, which simultaneously takes
into account the differential rotation and the centrifugal acceleration in a
non-perturbative way, was derived. This generalisation allowed us to study the
detectability and the signature of the differential rotation on GIWs in rapidly
rotating deformed stars and planets. We found that the effects of the
differential rotation in early-type deformed stars on GIWs is theoretically
largely detectable in modern space photometry using observations from
$\textit{Kepler}$ and TESS.

stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), the analysis needed to bound the privacy
leakage of a single training run is well understood. However, few studies have
reasoned about the privacy leakage resulting from the multiple training runs
needed to fine tune the value of the training algorithm's hyperparameters. In
this work, we first illustrate how simply setting hyperparameters based on
non-private training runs can leak private information. Motivated by this
observation, we then provide privacy guarantees for hyperparameter search
procedures within the framework of Renyi Differential Privacy. Our results
improve and extend the work of Liu and Talwar (STOC 2019). Our analysis
supports our previous observation that tuning hyperparameters does indeed leak
private information, but we prove that, under certain assumptions, this leakage
is modest, as long as each candidate training run needed to select
hyperparameters is itself differentially private.

find a natural compatibility condition between 3-term symmetric obstruction
theories that induces a virtual pullback formula. There are two types of
applications.
  Firstly, we introduce a Lefschetz principle in Donaldson-Thomas theory, which
relates the tautological DT4 invariants of a Calabi-Yau 4-fold with the DT3
invariants of its divisor. As corollaries, we prove the Cao-Kool conjecture on
the tautological Hilbert scheme invariants for very ample line bundles and the
Cao-Kool-Monavari conjecture on the tautological DT/PT correspondence for line
bundles with Calabi-Yau divisors when the tautological complexes are vector
bundles.
  Secondly, we present a correspondence between the Oh-Thomas virtual cycles on
the moduli spaces of pairs and the moduli spaces of sheaves by combining the
virtual pullback formula and a pushforward formula for virtual projective
bundles. As corollaries, we prove the Cao-Maulik-Toda conjecture on the primary
PT/GV correspondence for irreducible curve classes and the Cao-Toda conjecture
on the primary JS/GV correspondence under the coprime condition, assuming the
Cao-Maulik-Toda conjecture on the primary Katz/GV correspondence. Moreover, we

decades, with novel proposals related to the use of heterogeneous data sources,
probabilistic forecasting, online learn-ing, etc. A key aspect that emerged is
that learning and forecasting may highly benefit from distributed data, though
not only in the geographical sense. That is, various agents collect and own
data that may be useful to others. In contrast to recent proposals that look
into distributed and privacy-preserving learning (incentive-free), we explore
here a framework called regression markets. There, agents aiming to improve
their forecasts post a regression task, for which other agents may contribute
by sharing their data for their features and get monetarily rewarded for it.The
market design is for regression models that are linear in their parameters, and
possibly sep-arable, with estimation performed based on either batch or online
learning. Both in-sample and out-of-sample aspects are considered, with markets
for fitting models in-sample, and then for improving genuine forecasts
out-of-sample. Such regression markets rely on recent concepts within
interpretability of machine learning approaches and cooperative game theory,
with Shapley additive explanations. Besides introducing the market design and
proving its desirable properties, application results are shown based on
simulation studies (to highlight the salient features of the proposal) and with

outer-disk ($dN/d\tau \propto \tau^{-0.37 +/- 0.09}$) star clusters provides
evidence of mass-dependent cluster destruction in the central regions of LIRGs

with massive GMCs. Excluding the nuclear ring surrounding the Seyfert 1 nucleus

While chemical doping or hydrostatic pressure can change the local geometry,
these conventional approaches do not provide a clear pathway in tuning the

complicated structural deformation in the presence of the
tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition. Here, we demonstrate a systematic
approach to manipulate the local structural configurations in BaFe2As2
epitaxial thin films by controlling two independent structural factors
orthorhombicity (in-plane anisotropy) and tetragonality (out-of-plane/in-plane
balance) from lattice parameters. We tune superconductivity without chemical
doping utilizing both structural factors separately, controlling local
tetrahedral coordination in designed thin film heterostructures with substrate
clamping and bi-axial strain. We further show that this allows quantitative
control of both the structural phase transition, associated magnetism, and
superconductivity in the parent material BaFe2As2. This approach will advance
the development of tunable thin film superconductors in reduced dimension.

Fast Fourier transformation techniques are used to study the spatiotemporal
evolution of frequency and wave numbers along three directions from the dust

inhomogeneous throughout the dust cloud. The phase velocity of the wave is
estimated to be quite low and decreasing along the direction of propagation.
This effect is attributed to the strong reduction of particle charge due to a
high Havnes parameter along the propagation direction. By the estimation of
average particle charge, ion density and the finite electric field throughout
the nanodust cloud, a quantitative analysis of the void formation in nanodusty

understanding, controlling and preventing epidemic outbreaks. In a microscopic
description of the propagation of a disease over the complex network of human
contacts, the probability that an individual is in a given state (susceptible,
infectious, recovered etc) depends on the state of its neighbors in the
network. Thus it depends on the state of pairs of nodes, which in turns depends
on triples, in a hierarchy of dynamical dependencies. In order to produce
models that are at the same time reliable and manageable, one has to understand
how to truncate such a hierarchy, and how the chosen order of approximation
affects the ability of the model to forecast the real temporal evolution of an
epidemics. In this paper we provide a systematic analysis of the reliability
(under different hypotheses on the quantity and quality of available data) of
the predictions obtained by truncating the hierarchy either at the level of
individuals or at the level of pairs. We find that pair-based models are
reliable tools both for estimating the epidemiological parameters and for
forecasting the temporal evolution of the epidemics, under all conditions taken
into account in our work. However, a pair-based approach provides a much better
prediction of an individual-based one, only if better data, namely information
on the state of node pairs, are available. Overall, our results suggest that
more refined mathematical models need to be informed by improved contact
tracing techniques to better support decision on policies and containment
measures to adopt.

  https://github.com/Khrylx/Transform2Act",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An agent's functionality is largely determined by its design, i.e., skeletal
structure and joint attributes (e.g., length, size, strength). However, finding
the optimal agent design for a given function is extremely challenging since
the problem is inherently combinatorial and the design space is prohibitively
large. Additionally, it can be costly to evaluate each candidate design which
requires solving for its optimal controller. To tackle these problems, our key
idea is to incorporate the design procedure of an agent into its
decision-making process. Specifically, we learn a conditional policy that, in
an episode, first applies a sequence of transform actions to modify an agent's
skeletal structure and joint attributes, and then applies control actions under
the new design. To handle a variable number of joints across designs, we use a
graph-based policy where each graph node represents a joint and uses message
passing with its neighbors to output joint-specific actions. Using policy
gradient methods, our approach enables joint optimization of agent design and
control as well as experience sharing across different designs, which improves
sample efficiency substantially. Experiments show that our approach,
Transform2Act, outperforms prior methods significantly in terms of convergence
speed and final performance. Notably, Transform2Act can automatically discover
plausible designs similar to giraffes, squids, and spiders. Code and videos are

wavefunction scales rapidly with the number of qubits, the ability to learn
efficient representations is of critical importance. In this paper we study
magnitude-based pruning as a way to compress the wavefunction representation in
an RBM, focusing on RBMs trained on data from the transverse-field Ising model
in one dimension. We find that pruning can reduce the total number of RBM
weights, but the threshold at which the reconstruction accuracy starts to
degrade varies significantly depending on the phase of the model. In a gapped
region of the phase diagram, the RBM admits pruning over half of the weights
while still accurately reproducing relevant physical observables. At the
quantum critical point however, even a small amount of pruning can lead to
significant loss of accuracy in the physical properties of the reconstructed
quantum state. Our results highlight the importance of tracking all relevant
observables as their sensitivity varies strongly with pruning. Finally, we find
that sparse RBMs are trainable and discuss how a successful sparsity pattern
can be created without pruning.

equation is widely utilized in aerospace, microscopic flow, etc. Its
high-resolution simulation is crucial in these related areas. However, due to
the high dimensionality of the Boltzmann equation, high-resolution simulations
are often difficult to achieve numerically. The moment method which was first
proposed by Grad is among the popular numerical methods to achieve efficient
high-resolution simulations. We can derive the governing equations in the
moment method by taking moments on both sides of the Boltzmann equation, which
effectively reduces the dimensionality of the problem. However, one of the main
challenges is that it leads to an unclosed moment system, and closure is needed
to obtain a closed moment system. It is truly an art in designing closures for
moment systems and has been a significant research field in kinetic theory.
Other than the traditional human designs of closures, the machine
learning-based approach has attracted much attention lately in Han et al. and
Huang et al. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based method to derive
a moment closure model for the Boltzmann-BGK equation. In particular, the
closure relation is approximated by a carefully designed deep neural network
that possesses desirable physical invariances, i.e., the Galilean invariance,
reflecting invariance, and scaling invariance, inherited from the original
Boltzmann-BGK equation and playing an important role in the correct simulation
of the Boltzmann equation. Numerical simulations on the 1D-1D examples

because of its detrimental effect on market efficiency and many participating
financial actors. The recent increase of private retail investors due to new
low-fee platforms and new asset classes such as decentralised digital
currencies has increased the number of vulnerable actors due to lack of
institutional sophistication and strong regulation. This paper proposes a
method to detect illicit activity and inform investors on spoofing attempts, a
well-known market manipulation technique. Our framework is based on a highly
extendable Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model and allows the inclusion of market
variables that can explain spoofing and potentially other illicit activities.
The model is tested on granular order book data, in one of the most unregulated
markets prone to spoofing with a large number of non-institutional traders. The
results show that the model is performing well in an early detection context,
allowing the identification of spoofing attempts soon enough to allow investors
to react. This is the first step to a fully comprehensive model that will
protect investors in various unregulated trading environments and regulators to
identify illicit activity.

In MHD, the initial magnetic field within the star is weak. The hydrodynamics
simulation has limited angular momentum transport, resulting in repeating
cycles of mass accumulation into a rotationally-supported disc at small radii
followed by fall-back onto the star. The MHD simulation, conversely, has
efficient (Maxwell $\alpha_{\rm M}$ $\sim$ 0.04) angular momentum transport
provided by both of turbulent and coherent magnetic fields; a slowly decreting
midplane driven by the magnetorotational instability and a supersonic wind on
the surface of the disc driven by global magnetic torques. The angle and
time-averaged properties near the midplane agree reasonably well with a 1D
viscous decretion disc model with a modified $\tilde\alpha=0.5$, in which the
gas transitions from a subsonic thin disc to a supersonic spherical wind at the
critical point. 1D models, however, cannot capture the multi-phase

the basic properties of the viscous decretion disc paradigm, albeit coupled to
a laminar wind away from the midplane. Future modeling of Be star discs should

weak fields ($\lesssim 10\,\mathrm{G}$). Recently, we proposed that this
reflects the processing or lackthereof of fossil fields by subsurface
convection zones. Stars with weak fossil fields process these at the surface
into even weaker dynamo-generated fields, while in stars with stronger fossil
fields magnetism inhibits convection, allowing the fossil field to remain
as-is. We now expand on this theory and explore the time-scales involved in the
evolution of near-surface magnetic fields. We find that mass loss strips
near-surface regions faster than magnetic fields can diffuse through them. As a
result, observations of surface magnetism directly probe the frozen-in remains
of the convective dynamo. This explains the slow evolution of magnetism in
stars with very weak fields: these dynamo-\emph{generated} magnetic fields
evolve on the time-scale of the mass loss, not that of the dynamo.

inter-particle interactions combine with the topology of single particle states
to yield novel phenomena. Despite our mature understanding of these systems, an
open challenge has been to to develop a microscopic theory capturing both their
universal and non-universal properties, when the Hamiltonian is restricted to
the non-commutative space of the lowest Landau level. Here we develop such a
theory for the Jain sequence of bosonic fractional quantum Hall states at
fillings $\nu={p\over p+1}$. Building on a lowest Landau level description of a
parent composite fermi liquid at $\nu = 1$, we describe how to dope the system
to reach the Jain states. Upon doping, the composite fermions fill
non-commutative generalizations of Landau levels, and the Jain states
correspond to integer composite fermion filling. Using this approach, we obtain
an approximate expression for the bosonic Jain sequence gaps with no reference
to any long-wavelength approximation. Furthermore, we show that the universal
properties, such as Hall conductivity, are encoded in an effective
non-commutative Chern-Simons theory, which is obtained on integrating out the
composite fermions. This theory has the same topological content as the

to dark-matter-only simulations with a LCDM cosmology. To constrain the
theoretical models, we utilize a combination of galaxy number density and
selected scales of the projected correlation function, redshift-space
correlation function, group multiplicity function, average group velocity
dispersion, mark correlation function, and counts-in-cells statistics. We
design an algorithm to choose an optimal combination of measurements that
yields tight and accurate constraints on our model parameters. Compared to
previous work using fewer clustering statistics, we find significant
improvement in the constraints on all parameters of our halo model for two
different luminosity-threshold galaxy samples. Most interestingly, we obtain
unprecedented high-precision constraints on the scatter in the relationship
between galaxy luminosity and halo mass. However, our best-fit model results in
significant tension (>4 sigma) for both samples, indicating the need to add
second-order features to the standard HOD model. To guarantee the robustness of

simulations. We find that the gas bridge connecting the merging galaxies
pre-coalescence is dominated by turbulent pressure, with turbulent Mach numbers
peaking at values of 1.6-3.3. This implies that bridges are dominated by
supersonic turbulence, and are thus ideal candidates for studying the impact of
extreme environments on star formation. We also find that gas accreted from the
circumgalactic medium (CGM) during the merger significantly contributes (27-51
per cent) to the star formation rate (SFR) at the time of coalescence and
drives the subsequent reignition of star formation in the merger remnant.
Indeed, 19-53 per cent of the SFR at z=0 originates from gas belonging to the
CGM prior the merger. Finally, we investigate the origin of the
metallicity-diluted gas at the centre of merging galaxies. We show that this

Recent experiments demonstrated several surprising optical properties of
transient states induced by driving, including the appearance of photo-induced
edges in the reflectivity in cuprate superconductors, observed both below and
above the equilibrium transition temperature. Furthermore, in other driven
materials, reflection coefficients larger than unity have been observed. In
this paper we demonstrate that unusual optical properties of photoexcited
systems can be understood from the perspective of a Floquet system; a system
with periodically modulated system parameters originating from pump-induced
oscillations of a collective mode. We present a general phenomenological model
of reflectivity from Floquet materials, which takes into account parametric
generation of excitation pairs. We find a universal phase diagram of drive
induced features in reflectivity which evidence a competition between driving
and dissipation. To illustrate our general analysis we apply our formalism to
two concrete examples motivated by recent experiments: a single plasmon band,
which describes Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors, and a
phonon-polariton system, which describes upper and lower polaritons in
materials such as insulating SiC. Finally we demonstrate that our model can be
used to provide an accurate fit to results of phonon-pump - terahertz-probe

model explains the appearance of a pump-induced edge, which is higher in energy
than the equilibrium Josephson plasmon edge, even if the interlayer Josephson

{narrow-angle} tail galaxies in the literature even though they are part of a
low mass cluster. We find a spectral index steepening and an increase in
fractional polarization through the galaxy jets and an ordered magnetic field
component mostly aligned with the jet direction. This is likely caused by
either shear due to the velocity difference of the intracluster medium and the
jet fluid and/or magnetic draping of the intracluster medium across the galaxy
jets. We find clear evidence that one source is showing two active galactic
nuclei (AGN) outbursts from which we expect the AGN has never turned off
completely. We show that pure standard electron cooling cannot explain the jet
length. We demonstrate therefore that these galaxies can be used as a
laboratory to study gentle re-acceleration of relativistic electrons in galaxy
jets via transition from laminar to turbulent motion.

autonomous driving systems. To this end, the comprehension of the scene's
infrastructure is often the main clue for predicting future trajectories. Most
of the proposed approaches represent the scene with a rasterized format and
some of the more recent approaches leverage custom vectorized formats. In
contrast, we propose representing the scene's information by employing Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG). SVG is a well-established format that matches the
problem of trajectory prediction better than rasterized formats while being
more general than arbitrary vectorized formats. SVG has the potential to
provide the convenience and generality of raster-based solutions if coupled
with a powerful tool such as CNNs, for which we introduce SVG-Net. SVG-Net is a
Transformer-based Neural Network that can effectively capture the scene's
information from SVG inputs. Thanks to the self-attention mechanism in its
Transformers, SVG-Net can also adequately apprehend relations amongst the scene
and the agents. We demonstrate SVG-Net's effectiveness by evaluating its
performance on the publicly available Argoverse forecasting dataset. Finally,
we illustrate how, by using SVG, one can benefit from datasets and advancements
in other research fronts that also utilize the same input format. Our code is

(APT) provides compositional mapping of materials in three-dimensions with
sub-nanometre resolution, and is poised to play a key role in battery research.
However, APT is underpinned by an intense electric-field that can drive lithium

handling and sample transfer. Here, we report on the analysis of both anode and
cathode materials, and show that electric-field driven migration can be
suppressed by using shielding by embedding powder particles in a metallic

typical cathode material, cryogenic specimen preparation and transport under
ultra-high vacuum leads to major delithiation of the specimen during the

the material. Finally, we discuss the possible physical underpinnings and
discuss ways forward to enable shield of the electric field, which helps
address the challenges inherent to the APT analysis of battery materials.

role in the planet's appearance and environment. We must accurately represent a

the main physical processes that drive a planet's environment. In this work, we
improve the representation of mass transport in OASIS, which is the first step
towards a complete and flexible implementation of a condensible cycle. We
implement an upwind-biased scheme on a piece-wise linear approximation with a
flux-limiter to solve the mass transport equation. We first benchmark the new
scheme on a 2D problem that confirms the superior properties of the new method
over the central finite-volume method in terms of performance, accuracy and
shape-preserving mass distribution. Due to the new scheme's less dispersive
nature, we do not have to apply any unphysical diffusion to maintain the model
stable. OASIS includes the new improved solver in the total mass and the

properties of optimal control policies designed for systems with incorrect
priors applied to a true system. Filter stability refers to the correction of
an incorrectly initialized filter for a partially observed stochastic dynamical
system (controlled or control-free) with increasing measurements. This problem
has been studied extensively in the control-free context, and except for the
standard machinery for linear Gaussian systems involving the Kalman Filter, few
studies exist for the controlled setup. One of the main differences between
control-free and controlled partially observed Markov chains is that the filter
is always Markovian under the former, whereas under a controlled model the
filter process may not be Markovian since the control policy may depend on past
measurements in an arbitrary (measurable) fashion. This complicates the
dependency structure and therefore results from the control-free literature do
not directly apply to the controlled setup. In this paper, we study the filter
stability problem for controlled stochastic dynamical systems, and provide
sufficient conditions for when a falsely initialized filter merges with the
correctly initialized filter over time. These stability results are applied to
robust stochastic control problems: under filter stability, we bound the
difference in the expected cost incurred for implementing an incorrectly
designed control policy compared to an optimal policy. A conclusion is that
filter stability leads to stronger robustness results to incorrect priors
(compared with setups without controlled filter stability). Furthermore, if the
optimum cost is that same for each prior, the cost of mismatch between the true
prior and the assumed prior is zero.

meta-heuristics in applicable software processes has been gaining wide
attention. Recently, researchers have been advocating the adoption of
meta-heuristic algorithms for t-way testing strategies (where t points the
interaction strength among parameters). Although helpful, no single
meta-heuristic based t-way strategy can claim dominance over its counterparts.
For this reason, the hybridization of meta-heuristic algorithms can help to
ascertain the search capabilities of each by compensating for the limitations
of one algorithm with the strength of others. Consequently, a new
meta-heuristic based t-way strategy called Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony
(HABCSm) strategy, based on merging the advantages of the Artificial Bee Colony
(ABC) algorithm with the advantages of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
algorithm is proposed in this paper. HABCSm is the first t-way strategy to
adopt Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony (HABC) algorithm with Hamming distance as
its core method for generating a final test set and the first to adopt the
Hamming distance as the final selection criterion for enhancing the exploration
of new solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that HABCSm provides
superior competitive performance over its counterparts. Therefore, this finding
contributes to the field of software testing by minimizing the number of test
cases required for test execution.

critical to ascertain compositional information of the surface regolith of
hydrated asteroids. Generally, using entirely in situ spectral analysis, we
find that the laser produces similar effects in both samples. Specifically,

back to about half of its original level by the end of the irradiation.
Furthermore, we also find that laser irradiation causes the band depth on the

shifts less than 0.001 micron after laser irradiation. The constancy of the

suggests that this spectral region could be very useful to determine the
asteroid composition on surfaces on hydrated asteroids that have undergone
extensive aqueous alteration even if the surface had been subject to a
significant amount of space weathering. Whether the same conclusion will be
generally applicable to other surfaces containing minerals with a wide range of

better than the best baseline. Particularly, its performance is more robust to
the variation on triggers, attack settings, poison ratio, and clean data size.
Moreover, I-BAU requires less computation to take effect; particularly, it is
more than $13\times$ faster than the most efficient baseline in the

self-excited model rocket combustor during the transition from a stable state
to thermoacoustic instability through intermittency. We show the emergence of
synchronization between these oscillations from desynchronization through
intermittent phase synchronization during the onset of thermoacoustic
instability. We find substantial evidence that the intensities of the jet
flames close to the end wall is higher than that observed near the center of
the combustor as a result of its strong coupling to the local acoustic field.
Using concepts from recurrence theory, we distinguish the type of
synchronization between the acoustic pressure and the CH* intensity
oscillations at the end wall and the center of the combustor during
thermoacoustic instability. Analyzing the local CH* intensity oscillations, we
observe that the longitudinally propagating jet flames experience substantial
transverse displacement with flame merging effects during thermoacoustic

with the shock wave during intermittency and thermoacoustic instability at both
the end wall and the center of the combustor. We also discerned the change from

accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on retrograde orbits.
Such stars experience strong headwinds, aerodynamic drag, ablation and orbital
evolution on short timescales. Loss of orbital angular momentum in the first
$\sim 0.1$~Myr of an AGN leads to a heavy rain of stars (`starfall') into the
inner disk and onto the SMBH. A large AGN loss cone ($\theta_{\rm AGN,lc}$) can
result from binary scatterings in the inner disk and yield tidal disruption
events (TDEs). Signatures of starfall include optical/UV flares that rise in
luminosity over time, particularly in the inner disk. If the SMBH mass is
$M_{\rm SMBH} \ge 10^{8}M_{\odot}$, flares truncate abruptly and the star is
swallowed. If $M_{\rm SMBH}<10^{8}M_{\odot}$, and if the infalling orbit lies
within $\theta_{\rm AGN,lc}$, the flare is followed by a TDE which can be
prograde or retrograde relative to the AGN inner disk. Retrograde AGN TDEs are
over-luminous and short-lived as in-plane ejecta collide with the inner disk
and a lower AGN state follows. Prograde AGN TDEs add angular momentum to inner
disk gas and so start off looking like regular TDEs but are followed by an AGN
high state. Searches for such flare signatures test models of AGN `turn on',

elusive challenge in contemporary reinforcement learning. In this work, we
consider episodic reinforcement learning in a reward-mixing Markov decision
process (MDP). There, a reward function is drawn from one of multiple possible
reward models at the beginning of every episode, but the identity of the chosen
reward model is not revealed to the agent. Hence, the latent state space, for
which the dynamics are Markovian, is not given to the agent. We study the
problem of learning a near optimal policy for two reward-mixing MDPs. Unlike
existing approaches that rely on strong assumptions on the dynamics, we make no
assumptions and study the problem in full generality. Indeed, with no further
assumptions, even for two switching reward-models, the problem requires several
new ideas beyond existing algorithmic and analysis techniques for efficient
exploration. We provide the first polynomial-time algorithm that finds an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy after exploring $\tilde{O}(poly(H,\epsilon^{-1})
\cdot S^2 A^2)$ episodes, where $H$ is time-horizon and $S, A$ are the number
of states and actions respectively. This is the first efficient algorithm that
does not require any assumptions in partially observed environments where the
observation space is smaller than the latent state space.

in which the expressivity of the source speaker is preserved during conversion
while the identity of a target speaker is transferred. To do so, an original
neural- VC architecture is proposed based on sequence-to-sequence voice
conversion (S2S-VC) in which the speech prosody of the source speaker is
preserved during conversion. First, the S2S-VC architecture is modified so as
to synchronize the converted speech with the source speech by mean of phonetic
duration encoding; second, the decoder is conditioned on the desired sequence
of F0- values and an explicit F0-loss is formulated between the F0 of the
source speaker and the one of the converted speech. Besides, an adversarial
learning of conversions is integrated within the S2S-VC architecture so as to
exploit both advantages of reconstruction of original speech and converted
speech with manipulated attributes during training and then reducing the
inconsistency between training and conversion. An experimental evaluation on
the VCTK speech database shows that the speech prosody can be efficiently
preserved during conversion, and that the proposed adversarial learning
consistently improves the conversion and the naturalness of the reenacted
speech.

directly process 3D point clouds to classify objects can be threatened by
adversarial samples. Although existing adversarial attack methods achieve high
success rates, they do not restrict the point modifications enough to preserve
the point cloud appearance. To overcome this shortcoming, two constraints are
proposed. These include applying hard boundary constraints on the number of
modified points and on the point perturbation norms. Due to the restrictive
nature of the problem, the search space contains many local maxima. The
proposed method addresses this issue by using a high step-size at the beginning
of the algorithm to search the main surface of the point cloud fast and
effectively. Then, in order to converge to the desired output, the step-size is
gradually decreased. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, it is
run on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets by employing the
state-of-the-art point cloud classification models; including PointNet,
PointNet++, and DGCNN. The obtained results show that it can perform successful
attacks and achieve state-of-the-art results by only a limited number of point
modifications while preserving the appearance of the point cloud. Moreover, due
to the effective search algorithm, it can perform successful attacks in just a
few steps. Additionally, the proposed step-size scheduling algorithm shows an
improvement of up to $14.5\%$ when adopted by other methods as well. The
proposed method also performs effectively against popular defense methods.

Network (GNN), in which each node's representation is computed recursively by
aggregating representations (messages) from its immediate neighbors akin to a
star-shaped pattern. MPNNs are appealing for being efficient and scalable,
how-ever their expressiveness is upper-bounded by the 1st-order
Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test (1-WL). In response, prior works propose
highly expressive models at the cost of scalability and sometimes
generalization performance. Our work stands between these two regimes: we
introduce a general framework to uplift any MPNN to be more expressive, with
limited scalability overhead and greatly improved practical performance. We
achieve this by extending local aggregation in MPNNs from star patterns to
general subgraph patterns (e.g.,k-egonets):in our framework, each node
representation is computed as the encoding of a surrounding induced subgraph
rather than encoding of immediate neighbors only (i.e. a star). We choose the
subgraph encoder to be a GNN (mainly MPNNs, considering scalability) to design
a general framework that serves as a wrapper to up-lift any GNN. We call our
proposed method GNN-AK(GNN As Kernel), as the framework resembles a
convolutional neural network by replacing the kernel with GNNs. Theoretically,
we show that our framework is strictly more powerful than 1&2-WL, and is not
less powerful than 3-WL. We also design subgraph sampling strategies which
greatly reduce memory footprint and improve speed while maintaining
performance. Our method sets new state-of-the-art performance by large margins
for several well-known graph ML tasks; specifically, 0.08 MAE on ZINC,74.79%
and 86.887% accuracy on CIFAR10 and PATTERN respectively.

fast must also be exponentially ill-conditioned. We prove a positive
counterpart to this `impossibility' theorem. Our `possibility' theorem shows
that there is a well-conditioned method that provides exponential decay of the
error down to a finite, but user-controlled tolerance $\epsilon > 0$, which in
practice can be chosen close to machine epsilon. The method is known as
\textit{polynomial frame} approximation or \textit{polynomial extensions}. It
uses algebraic polynomials of degree $n$ on an extended interval
$[-\gamma,\gamma]$, $\gamma > 1$, to construct an approximation on $[-1,1]$ via
a SVD-regularized least-squares fit. A key step in the proof of our main

introduces Design Strategy Network (DSN), a data-driven deep hierarchical
framework that can learn strategies over these arbitrary complex action spaces.
The hierarchical architecture decomposes every action decision into first
predicting a preferred spatial region in the design space and then outputting a
probability distribution over a set of possible actions from that region. This
framework comprises a convolutional encoder to work with image-based design
state representations, a multi-layer perceptron to predict a spatial region,
and a weight-sharing network to generate a probability distribution over
unordered set-based inputs of feasible actions. Applied to a truss design
study, the framework learns to predict the actions of human designers in the

that DSNs significantly outperform non-hierarchical methods of policy

Internet of Things (IoT) devices in many usage scenarios. The challenges of
typical massive IoT applications with sporadic and short packet uplink
transmissions are well studied, while not enough attention is given to the
delivery of content of common interest, such as software/firmware updates and
remote control, towards IoT devices in emerging point-to-multipoint scenarios.
Moreover, the delivery of delay-sensitive IoT traffic is not sufficiently
addressed in the literature. In this work we (i) identify the drawbacks of the
current Single-Cell Point-to-Multipoint (SC-PTM) solution for unplanned
critical traffic delivery in cellular IoT (cIoT) networks, and (ii) propose
paging and multicast schemes for a fast distribution of critical updates after,
e.g., bug fixes or system failures. We benchmark the performance of the
proposed paging scheme against similar solutions available in the literature.
Our extended SC-PTM framework is energy efficient and guarantees low service
latency, as demonstrated both analytically and by simulations.

classification tasks in the last few years. Commonly, this is framed in a
transductive semi-supervised learning setup wherein the entire graph, including
the target nodes to be labeled, is available for training. Driven in part by
scalability, recent works have focused on the inductive case where only the
labeled portion of a graph is available for training. In this context, our
current work considers a challenging inductive setting where a set of labeled
graphs are available for training while the unlabeled target graph is
completely separate, i.e., there are no connections between labeled and
unlabeled nodes. Under the implicit assumption that the testing and training
graphs come from similar distributions, our goal is to develop a labeling
function that generalizes to unobserved connectivity structures. To that end,
we employ a graph neural tangent kernel (GNTK) that corresponds to infinitely
wide GNNs to find correspondences between nodes in different graphs based on
both the topology and the node features. We augment the capabilities of the
GNTK with residual connections and empirically illustrate its performance gains

spectroscopy has been widely used for the analysis of food quality, safety, and
nutritional properties. Due to the complexity of food systems and the lack of
comprehensive predictive models, rapid and simple measurements to predict
complex properties in food systems are largely missing. Machine Learning (ML)
has shown great potential to improve classification and prediction of these
properties. However, the barriers to collect large datasets for ML applications
still persists. In this paper, we explore different approaches of data
annotation and model training to improve data efficiency for ML applications.
Specifically, we leverage Active Learning (AL) and Semi-Supervised Learning
(SSL) and investigate four approaches: baseline passive learning, AL, SSL, and
a hybrid of AL and SSL. To evaluate these approaches, we collect two
spectroscopy datasets: predicting plasma dosage and detecting foodborne

50% and 25% for each ML application, respectively.

enhance performance and security of delivered traffic in 5G-oriented networks,

distributions. For example, Langevin dynamics (LD) extracts asymptotically
exact samples from a diffusion process because the time evolution of its
marginal distributions constitutes a curve that minimizes the KL-divergence via
steepest descent in the Wasserstein space. Parallel to LD, Stein variational
gradient descent (SVGD) similarly minimizes the KL, albeit endowed with a novel
Stein-Wasserstein distance, by deterministically transporting a set of particle
samples, thus de-randomizes the stochastic diffusion process. We propose
de-randomized kernel-based particle samplers to all diffusion-based samplers
known as MCMC dynamics. Following previous work in interpreting MCMC dynamics,
we equip the Stein-Wasserstein space with a fiber-Riemannian Poisson structure,
with the capacity of characterizing a fiber-gradient Hamiltonian flow that
simulates MCMC dynamics. Such dynamics discretizes into generalized SVGD
(GSVGD), a Stein-type deterministic particle sampler, with particle updates
coinciding with applying the diffusion Stein operator to a kernel function. We
demonstrate empirically that GSVGD can de-randomize complex MCMC dynamics,
which combine the advantages of auxiliary momentum variables and Riemannian
structure, while maintaining the high sample quality from an interacting
particle system.

discriminating between 5 and 14 coughers using longer (100 sec) segments in the

Unlike speech, i-vectors outperform x-vectors and d-vectors in identifying

deficiencies and improve predictive skills, it is important to obtain
process-level understanding of the interactions between different processes.
Conditional sampling and budget analysis are powerful tools for
process-oriented model evaluation, but they often require tedious ad hoc coding
and large amounts of instantaneous model output, resulting in inefficient use
of human and computing resources. This paper presents an online diagnostic tool
that addresses this challenge by monitoring model variables in a generic manner
as they evolve within the time integration cycle.
  The tool is convenient to use. It allows users to select sampling conditions
and specify monitored variables at run time. Both the evolving values of the
model variables and their increments caused by different atmospheric processes
can be monitored and archived. Online calculation of vertical integrals is also
supported. Multiple sampling conditions can be monitored in a single simulation
in combination with unconditional sampling. The paper explains in detail the
design and implementation of the tool in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model
(E3SM) version 1. The usage is demonstrated through three examples: a global
budget analysis of dust aerosol mass concentration, a composite analysis of sea
salt emission and its dependency on surface wind speed, and a conditionally
sampled relative humidity budget. The tool is expected to be easily portable to
closely related atmospheric models that use the same or similar data structures
and time integration methods.

(BOFiP) for the optimization of high dimensional black box functions. BOFiP
decomposes the original, high dimensional, space into several sub-spaces
defined by non-overlapping sets of dimensions. These sets are randomly
generated at the start of the algorithm, and they form a partition of the
dimensions of the original space. BOFiP searches the original space with
alternating BO, within sub-spaces, and information exchange among sub-spaces,
to update the sub-space function evaluation. The basic idea is to distribute
the high dimensional optimization across low dimensional sub-spaces, where each
sub-space is a player in an equal interest game. At each iteration, BO produces
approximate best replies that update the players belief distribution. The
belief update and BO alternate until a stopping condition is met.
  High dimensional problems are common in real applications, and several
contributions in the BO literature have highlighted the difficulty in scaling
to high dimensions due to the computational complexity associated to the
estimation of the model hyperparameters. Such complexity is exponential in the
problem dimension, resulting in substantial loss of performance for most
techniques with the increase of the input dimensionality.
  We compare BOFiP to several state-of-the-art approaches in the field of high
dimensional black box optimization. The numerical experiments show the
performance over three benchmark objective functions from 20 up to 1000
dimensions. A neural network architecture design problem is tested with 42 up
to 911 nodes in 6 up to 92 layers, respectively, resulting into networks with
500 up to 10,000 weights. These sets of experiments empirically show that BOFiP
outperforms its competitors, showing consistent performance across different

continuous ferroquadrupolar phase transition associated with local
partially-filled $4f$ orbitals of the thulium (Tm$^{3+}$) ions. The
ferroquadrupolar transition, a realization of Ising nematicity, can be tuned to
a quantum critical point using a magnetic field oriented along the $c$-axis of
the tetragonal crystal lattice, which acts as an effective transverse field for
the Ising-nematic order. In small magnetic fields, the thermal phase transition
can be well-described using a semi-classical mean field treatment of the
transverse field Ising model. However, in higher magnetic fields, closer to the
field-tuned quantum phase transition, subtle deviations from this
semi-classical behavior are observed due to quantum fluctuations. Although the
phase transition is driven by the local $4f$ degrees of freedom, the crystal
lattice still plays a crucial role, both in terms of mediating the interactions
between the local quadrupoles, and in determining the critical scaling
exponents, even though the phase transition itself can be described via mean
field. In particular, bilinear coupling of the nematic order parameter to
acoustic phonons changes the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the former in
a fundamental way, resulting in different critical behavior of the nematic
transverse-field Ising model as compared to the usual case of the magnetic
transverse-field Ising model. Our results establish TmVO$_{4}$ as a model

configurational entropy. But this definition depends only on the chemical
composition of a HEA and therefore cannot distinguish the information content
that is encoded in various local atomic arrangements and measurable by the
Shannon entropy in information theory. Here, inspired by the finding that
two-dimensional (2D) Sudoku matrices exhibit higher average Shannon entropy
than 2D random matrix counterparts, we propose high-Shannon-entropy alloys
(HSEA), whose structures are based on 3D Sudoku matrices. Despite the
constraints on the atomic arrangements to form a 3D Sudoku 4 x 4 x 4 matrix, we
find that, a prototypical HSEA, NbMoTaW has a lower energy than the same HEA
with a random structure due to the smaller lattice distortion. We compute the
electronic structures and mechanical properties and find that the HSEA exhibits
enhanced average Fermi velocity and ductility over the random NbMoTaW HEA.
Finally, we evaluate the formation energies of single vacancies and a vacancy
cluster in the HSEA, whose configurations mimic Sudoku puzzles with one and
several missing numbers, respectively. We find that a range of large energies
are required to generate such vacancies, which depend on the location and
species of missing atoms. Our work shows that introducing the Shannon entropy
to HEAs offers a useful metric to reveal more atomic details of HEAs and that
HSEAs represent an uncharted domain in the complicated energy landscape of HEAs

the Internet of Things (IoT) due to the wide variety of hardware and software
technologies involved. Moving target defense (MTD) has been adopted as an
innovative strategy to solve this problem by dynamically changing target system
properties and configurations to obfuscate the attack surface. Nevertheless,
the existing work of MTD primarily focuses on lower-level properties (e.g., IP
addresses or port numbers), and only a limited number of variations can be
generated based on these properties. In this paper, we propose a new approach
of MTD through communication protocol dialects (MPD) - which dynamically
customizes a communication protocol into various protocol dialects and
leverages them to create a moving target defense. Specifically, MPD harnesses a
dialect generating function to create protocol dialects and then a mapping
function to select one specific dialect for each packet during communication.
To keep different network entities in synchronization, we also design a
self-synchronization mechanism utilizing a pseudo-random number generator with
the input of a pre-shared secret key and previously sent packets. We implement
a prototype of MPD and evaluate its feasibility on standard network protocol
(i.e., File Transfer Protocol) and internet of things protocol (i.e., Message
Queuing Telemetry Transport). The results indicate that MPD can create a moving
target defense with protocol dialects to effectively address various attacks -
including the denial of service attack and malicious packet modifications -
with negligible overhead.

question of how to determine when the model is `good enough' without the
additional labels required for traditional evaluation. Previously, different
stopping criteria have been proposed aiming to identify the optimal stopping
point. Yet, optimality can only be expressed as a domain-dependent trade-off

providing actionable recommendations for which stopping criteria are best for a

consider in the transport equation a diffusive term accounting for
hydrodynamics (or, mechanical) dispersion, with an effective diffusion
coefficient that is proportional to the local interstitial velocity. A few
two-dimensional (2D) numerical studies, and three-dimensional (3D) experimental
investigations, have investigated the impact of hydrodynamic dispersion on
convection dynamics, with contradictory conclusions. Here, we investigate
systematically the impact of the dispersion strength $S$ (relative to molecular
diffusion), and of the anisotropy $\alpha$ of its tensor, on convective
dissolution in 2D and 3D geometries. We use a new numerical model and analyze
the solute fingers' number density (FND), penetration depth and maximum
velocity; the onset time of convection; the dissolution flux in the
quasi-constant flux regime; the mean concentration of the dissolved CO2; and
the scalar dissipation rate. The efficiency of convective dissolution over long
times is observed to be mostly controlled by the onset time of convection. For
most natural porous media ($\alpha = 0.1$), the onset time is found to increase
as a function of $S$, in agreement with previous experimental findings and in
stark contrast to previous numerical findings. However, if $\alpha$ is
sufficiently large this behavior is reversed. Furthermore, results in 3D are
fully consistent with the 2D results on all accounts, except that in 3D the
onset time is slightly smaller, the dissolution flux in the quasi-constant flux
regime is slightly larger, and the dependence of the FND on the dispersion
parameters is impacted by $Ra$.

To this end, we propose a peeling algorithm based on nodewise regressions to

Second, we propose a likelihood ratio test integrated with a data perturbation

perturbations. We examine this scenario in viscoelastic fluids, and identify
new mechanisms by which significant vorticity perturbations can be generated in
both inertialess and elasto-inertial channel flows. We focus on the case where
the lengthscale of the surface distortion is much longer than the channel
depth, where we find significant departure from plane shear (Page & Zaki, J.
Fluid Mech. 801 2016) due to the non-monotonic base-flow streamwise-normal
elastic stress. In inertialess flows, a purely elastic response results in
streamlines deforming to match the bottom topography in the lower half the
channel. However, the vanishing stress at the centreline introduces a blocking
effect, and the associated $O(1)$ jump in normal velocity is balanced by a
narrow, large amplitude streamwise-oscillating `jet', resulting in a localised,
chevron-shaped vorticity perturbation field. In elasto-inertial flows,
resonance between the frequency of elasto-inertial `Alfven' waves and the
frequency apparent to an observer moving with the fluid results in vorticity
amplification in a pair of critical layers on either side of the channel. The
vorticity in both layers is equal in magnitude and as such the perturbation
vorticity field penetrates the full channel depth even when inertia is
dominant. The results demonstrate that long-wave distortions - which are
relatively innocuous in Newtonian fluids - can drive a significant flow
distortion in viscoelastic fluids for a wide range of parameter values.

Bayesian reconstruction with generative models (L-BRGM), entails joint
optimization over the style-code and the input latent code, and enhances the
expressive power of a pre-trained StyleGAN2 generator by allowing the
style-codes to be different for different generator layers. Considering the
inverse problems of image inpainting and super-resolution, we demonstrate that
the proposed approach is competitive with, and sometimes superior to,

moderately different from their nominal value, thus giving a possible
interpretation of the tension between the early- and late-Universe probes. The
resulting value for the structure growth parameter is $S_8 = 0.754 \pm 0.016$

multiplicative bias parameters for cosmic shear, and by fixing all calibration
parameters to their expected values. These tests result in worse fits compared
to our fiducial run, especially for the case when all calibration parameters

results. However, despite preliminary understandings developed for adversarial
training, it is still not clear, from the architectural perspective, what
configurations can lead to more robust DNNs. In this paper, we address this gap
via a comprehensive investigation on the impact of network width and depth on
the robustness of adversarially trained DNNs. Specifically, we make the
following key observations: 1) more parameters (higher model capacity) does not
necessarily help adversarial robustness; 2) reducing capacity at the last stage
(the last group of blocks) of the network can actually improve adversarial
robustness; and 3) under the same parameter budget, there exists an optimal

estimating treatment effects in medical research, there is increasing use of
and interest in using real-world data for drug development. One such use case
is the construction of external control arms for evaluation of efficacy in
single-arm trials, particularly in cases where randomization is either
infeasible or unethical. However, it is well known that treated patients in
non-randomized studies may not be comparable to control patients -- on either
measured or unmeasured variables -- and that the underlying population
differences between the two groups may result in biased treatment effect
estimates as well as increased variability in estimation. To address these
challenges for analyses of time-to-event outcomes, we developed a meta-analytic
framework that uses historical reference studies to adjust a log hazard ratio
estimate in a new external control study for its additional bias and
variability. The set of historical studies is formed by constructing external
control arms for historical RCTs, and a meta-analysis compares the trial
controls to the external control arms. Importantly, a prospective external
control study can be performed independently of the meta-analysis using
standard causal inference techniques for observational data. We illustrate our
approach with a simulation study and an empirical example based on reference
studies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. In our empirical analysis,
external control patients had lower survival than trial controls (hazard ratio:
0.907), but our methodology is able to correct for this bias. An implementation
of our approach is available in the R package ecmeta.

determine dynamical masses and orbital elements for Earth-sized transiting
planets. Precise mass determination is fundamental to restrict planetary
densities and thus infer planetary compositions. In this work, we present
Nauyaca, a Python package dedicated to find planetary masses and orbital
elements through the fitting of observed mid-transit times from a N-body
approach. The fitting strategy consists in performing a sequence of
minimization algorithms (optimizers) that are used to identify high probability
regions in the parameter space. These results from optimizers are used for
initialization of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, using an adaptive
Parallel-Tempering algorithm. A set of runs are performed in order to obtain
posterior distributions of planetary masses and orbital elements. In order to
test the tool, we created a mock catalog of synthetic planetary systems with
different number of planets where all of them transit. We calculate their
mid-transit times to give them as an input to Nauyaca, testing statistically
its efficiency in recovering the planetary parameters from the catalog. For the
recovered planets, we find typical dispersions around the real values of
$\sim$1-14 M$_{\oplus}$ for masses, between 10-110 seconds for periods and
between $\sim$0.01-0.03 for eccentricities. We also investigate the effects of
the signal-to-noise and number of transits in the correct determination of the
planetary parameters. Finally, we suggest choices of the parameters that govern
the tool, for the usage with real planets, according to the complexity of the
problem and computational facilities.

problem then generate solutions to the Stefan problem for both supercooled
fluid freezing $(St_1)$ and ice melting $(St_2)$, depending on the type of cost
for optimality. The freezing $(St_1)$ case has not been well understood in the
literature beyond one dimension, while our result gives a well-posedness of
weak solution in general dimensions, with naturally chosen initial data. The
cost is a Lagrangian type integral along path, where the Lagrangian function
satisfies strict time monotonicity, increasing (Type (I) or decreasing (Type
(II)). Type (I) case corresponds to the freezing fluid while type (II) to the
melting ice. The optimal stopping time is characterized by the hitting time to
a certain monotone barrier set in the space-time, while the optimal target
distribution saturates the density constraint. The barrier sets are determined
by the type of the cost and the initial distribution, and give the space-time
free boundaries of the flow for the Stefan problems $(St_1)$, $(St_2)$. The
free target optimization problem exhibits monotonicity, from which a remarkable
universality follows in the sense that the optimal target distribution is
independent of the cost or its type. This gives a new connection between the

often encountered in oncology trials, alternative tests have been proposed. The
maximum weighted logrank test was shown to be robust in general situations. In
this manuscript, we propose a new maximum test that incorporates the weight for
detecting crossing hazards. The new weight is a function of the crossing
time-point. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to compare our methods
with other methods proposed in the literature under scenarios with various
hazard ratio patterns, sample sizes, censoring rates, and censoring patterns.
For crossing hazards, the proposed test is shown to be the most powerful one
with a known crossing time-point. It has a similar performance as the Maxcombo
test in the misspecified crossing time-point scenario. Under other alternative
situations, the new test remains comparatively powerful as the Maxcombo test.
Finally, we illustrate the test in a real data example and discuss the
procedures to extend the test to detect crossing hazards specifically.

\rho_{xx}(T) \propto 1/T$ in a parametrically large interval. When the disorder
is scalar-like, the $\propto 1/T$ behavior is the leading contribution in the
crossover between diffusive regime exhibiting weak localization and quantum
magnetooscillations. The behavior originates from the field-induced breaking of
the chiral symmetry of Dirac electrons around a single valley. The result is
specific for generic two-dimensional Dirac materials which deviate from the
half-filling. We conclude by proposing magnetotransport experiments, which have
the capacity to detect the nature of impurities and defects in high-mobility
Dirac monolayers such as recently fabricated ballistic graphene samples.

reduce the burden on national health care systems and to mitigate the effects
of the outbreak, accurate modelling and forecasting methods for short- and

insights, such as data available from social media. However, the combined use
of structured and unstructured information is still uncharted. This paper aims
at filling this gap, by leveraging historical and social media information with
a novel data integration methodology. The proposed approach is based on vine
copulas, which allow us to exploit the dependencies between different sources
of information. We apply the methodology to combine structured datasets
retrieved from official sources and a big unstructured dataset of information
collected from social media. The results show that the combined use of official

an epidemic, which can inform policy decisions. Another task is inferring the
origin of a disease, which is relatively difficult with current mathematical
models. Such frameworks -- across varying levels of complexity -- are typically
sensitive to input data on epidemic parameters, case-counts and mortality
rates, which are generally noisy and incomplete. To alleviate these
limitations, we propose a maximum entropy framework that fits epidemiological
models, provides a calibrated infection origin probabilities, and is robust to
noise due to a prior belief model. Maximum entropy is agnostic to the
parameters or model structure used and allows for flexible use when faced with
sparse data conditions and incomplete knowledge in the dynamical phase of
disease-spread, providing for more reliable modeling at early stages of
outbreaks. We evaluate the performance of our model by predicting future
disease trajectories in synthetic graph networks and the real mobility network
of New York state. In addition, unlike existing approaches, we demonstrate that
the method can be used to infer the origin of the outbreak with accurate
confidence. Indeed, despite the prevalent belief on the feasibility of
contact-tracing being limited to the initial stages of an outbreak, we report
the possibility of reconstructing early disease dynamics, including the
epidemic seed, at advanced stages.

present a novel semi-empirical model for the evolution of the QLF that is fully
defined after the specification of a free parameter, the internal duty cycle,
$\varepsilon_{DC}$ along with minimal other assumptions. All remaining model
parameters are fixed upon calibration against the QLF at two redshifts, $z=4$

the stochasticity in the median quasar luminosity versus halo mass relation,
while the faint end shape is determined by the evolution of the Halo Mass
Function (HMF) with redshift. Additionally, our model suggests the overall
quasar density is determined by the evolution of the HMF, irrespective of the
value of $\varepsilon_{DC}$. The $z\ge4$ QLFs from our model are in excellent
agreement with current observations for all $\varepsilon_{DC}$, with model
predictions suggesting that observations at $z\gtrsim7.5$ are needed to
discriminate between different $\varepsilon_{DC}$. We further extend the model
at $z\le4$, successfully describing the QLF between $1\le z\le4$, albeit with

from galaxy mergers, extended star-forming discs or the late formation of a

increasing with galaxy mass, and the the fraction of Type II galaxies
increasing with Hubble type. We investigate the lower incidence of Type II
galaxies in galaxy clusters, finding, in a striking similarity to observed
galaxies, that almost no S0-like galaxies in clusters have Type II profiles.
Similarly, the fraction of Type II profiles for disc-dominated galaxies in
clusters is significantly decreased relative to field galaxies. This difference
between field and cluster galaxies is driven by star formation quenching.

We find that the maximum number of Alices who can share steering with a single

they cannot effectively extract sufficient local details to tackle ambiguous
boundaries. We propose a novel boundary-aware transformer (BAT) to

Particularly, the auxiliary supervision of BAG is capable of assisting

practice and graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be effective on
various graph tasks with randomly separated training and testing data. In real
applications, however, the distribution of training graph might be different
from that of the test one (e.g., users' interactions on the user-item training
graph and their actual preference on items, i.e., testing environment, are
known to have inconsistencies in recommender systems). Moreover, the
distribution of test data is always agnostic when GNNs are trained. Hence, we
are facing the agnostic distribution shift between training and testing on
graph learning, which would lead to unstable inference of traditional GNNs
across different test environments. To address this problem, we propose a novel
stable prediction framework for GNNs, which permits both locally and globally
stable learning and prediction on graphs. In particular, since each node is
partially represented by its neighbors in GNNs, we propose to capture the
stable properties for each node (locally stable) by re-weighting the
information propagation/aggregation processes. For global stability, we propose
a stable regularizer that reduces the training losses on heterogeneous
environments and thus warping the GNNs to generalize well. We conduct extensive
experiments on several graph benchmarks and a noisy industrial recommendation
dataset that is collected from 5 consecutive days during a product promotion
festival. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms various SOTA GNNs
for stable prediction on graphs with agnostic distribution shift, including
shift caused by node labels and attributes.

consensus on the relationship between SC and CDW has not been established in
IrTe2, where either competing or collaboration pictures have been suggested in
the bulk or thick flakes. Here, we use the state-of-art Au-assisted exfoliation
method to overcome the obstacle of interlayer Te-Te bonding, cleaving the IrTe2
down to monolayer for the first time. A striking feature revealed by
angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy (ARPRS) and electrical transport
measurements is the concurrence of phase separation in one single piece of
nano-flake, i.e. the superconducting (P-3m1) and CDW (P-3) area. In the pure SC
area, the dimensional fluctuations completely suppress the CDW ordering and
induce SC at 3.5 K. Meanwhile, the pure CDW area with much enhanced TCDW at 605
K (compared to TCDW = 280 K in bulk) is always accompanied by a unique wrinkle
pattern. Detailed analyses suggest the local strain-induced bond breaking of
the Te-Te dimer facilitates the emergence of the CDW order. Our works provide
compelling evidence of competition between SC and CDW, highlighting the
importance of microstructure in determining the ground states of IrTe2.

We propose to pre-train the Transformer model with such automatically generated

to achieve satisfying prediction performance, the quality of the training data

the malicious training data, i.e., generating a subgraph sequence as the
trigger and embedding it to the training data. However, the vulnerability of
DLP toward backdoor attacks has not been studied yet. To address the issue, we
propose a novel backdoor attack framework on DLP, denoted as Dyn-Backdoor.
Specifically, Dyn-Backdoor generates diverse initial-triggers by a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Then partial links of the initial-triggers are
selected to form a trigger set, according to the gradient information of the
attack discriminator in the GAN, so as to reduce the size of triggers and

customized to the complexity of fundus images. To overcome this issue, we
introduce an approach for custom-design of CNN models, whose architectures are
adapted to the structural patterns of fundus images and better represent the
DR-relevant features. It takes the leverage of k-medoid clustering, principal
component analysis (PCA), and inter-class and intra-class variations to
automatically determine the depth and width of a CNN model. The designed models
are lightweight, adapted to the internal structures of fundus images, and
encode the discriminative patterns of DR lesions. The technique is validated on
a local dataset from King Saud University Medical City, Saudi Arabia, and two
challenging benchmark datasets from Kaggle: EyePACS and APTOS2019. The
custom-designed models outperform the famous pre-trained CNN models like
ResNet152, Densnet121, and ResNeSt50 with a significant decrease in the number

algorithm (LNS-AGA) for many-to-many on-orbit repairing mission planning of
geosynchronous orbit (GEO) satellites with mission deadline constraint. In the
many-to-many on-orbit repairing scenario, several servicing spacecrafts and
target satellites are located in GEO orbits which have different inclination,
RAAN and true anomaly. Each servicing spacecraft need to rendezvous with target
satellites to perform repairing missions under limited fuel. The mission
objective is to find the optimal servicing sequence and orbit rendezvous time
of every servicing spacecraft to minimize total cost of all servicing
spacecrafts with all target satellites repaired. Firstly, a time-dependent
orbital rendezvous strategy is proposed, which can handle the mission deadline
constraint. Besides, it is also cost-effective compared with the existing
strategy. Based on this strategy, the many-to-many on-orbit repairing mission
planning model can be simplified to an integer programming problem, which is
established based on the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW)
model. In order to efficiently find a feasible optimal solution under
complicated constraints, a hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm combining the
large neighborhood search procedure is designed. The operations of ""destroy""
and ""repair"" are used on the elite individuals in each generation of the
genetic algorithm to enhance local search capabilities. Finally, the
simulations under different scenarios are carried out to verify the
effectiveness of the presented algorithm and orbital rendezvous strategy, which
performs better than the traditional genetic algorithm.

  Predictive Learning",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning predictive models for unlabeled spatiotemporal data is challenging
in part because visual dynamics can be highly entangled in real scenes, making
existing approaches prone to overfit partial modes of physical processes while
neglecting to reason about others. We name this phenomenon spatiotemporal mode
collapse and explore it for the first time in predictive learning. The key is
to provide the model with a strong inductive bias to discover the compositional
structures of latent modes. To this end, we propose ModeRNN, which introduces a
novel method to learn structured hidden representations between recurrent
states. The core idea of this framework is to first extract various components
of visual dynamics using a set of spatiotemporal slots with independent
parameters. Considering that multiple space-time patterns may co-exist in a
sequence, we leverage learnable importance weights to adaptively aggregate slot
features into a unified hidden representation, which is then used to update the
recurrent states. Across the entire dataset, different modes result in
different responses on the mixtures of slots, which enhances the ability of
ModeRNN to build structured representations and thus prevents the so-called
mode collapse. Unlike existing models, ModeRNN is shown to prevent
spatiotemporal mode collapse and further benefit from learning mixed visual
dynamics.

Pa$\alpha$ in 49 cases. We find that a single Lorentzian fit (preferred on
theoretical grounds) is preferred over multi-component Gaussian fits to the
line profiles; a lack of narrow-line region emission, overwhelmed by the
pole-on view of the broad line region (BLR) light, supports this. We recompute
the catalog black hole (BH) mass estimates, using the values of FWHM and
luminosity of H$\beta$, both from catalog values and re-fitted Lorentzian
values. We find a relationship slope greater than unity compared to the catalog
values. We ascribe this to contamination by galactic light or difficulties with
line flux measurements. However, the comparison of masses computed by the
fitted Lorentzian and Gaussian measurements show a slope close to unity.
Comparing the BH masses estimated from both Pa$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, the line
widths and fluxes shows deviations from expected; in general, however, the
computed BH masses are comparable. We posit a scenario where an intermixture of
dusty and dust-free clouds (or alternately a structured atmosphere)
differentially absorbs the line radiation of the BLR, due to dust absorption

deterministic Adam) and show they also converge to the L2 max-margin solution.
Technically, to overcome the difficulty of the error accumulation in analyzing

the model parameter and the max-margin solution. Numerical experiments are

explore how quantum measurements of the emitted photons using photon number

proposed new approach, the problem of counting emitters reduces to the task of
determining differences between the emitted photons and the Poisson limit. We
show that quantum measurements of the number of photons emitted from an

and the probability of emission. This method can be applied for any type of
emitters, including Raman and infrared emitters, which makes it a truly
universal way to achieve super-resolution optical imaging. The scaling laws of
this new approach are presented by the Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds and define the

modifications, but the corresponding creation and annihilation operators obey
usual algebra. We show that imposing the condition that the commutation
relation between the field and its conjugate is same as that in the commutative

these deformed commutation relations derived are valid to all orders in the
non-commutative parameter. By analysing the first non-vanishing terms which are

$1/\lambda^4$, where $\lambda$ is the length scale set by the non-commutativity

Further, we analyse the effects of non-commutativity on Unruh effect by

carrier- and phonon-dynamics in semiconductors. In their heterostructures, it
is often not straightforward to distinguish contributions to the signal from
the various layers. In this work, we perform transient reflectivity
measurements on lattice-matched GaP/Si(001) using a near infrared pulse, to
which GaP is transparent. The pump laser pulse can generate coherent
longitudinal optical (LO) phonons both in the GaP overlayer as well as in the
Si substrate which have distinct frequencies. This enables us to track the
amplitude of the respective signal contributions as a function of GaP layer
thickness $d$. The Si phonon amplitude in the signal exhibits an oscillatory
behavior with increasing $d$. This can be quantitatively explained by the
interference of the probe light reflected at the air/GaP/Si heterointerface.
Based on this knowledge, we can then separate the interface- and the
substrate-contributions in the carrier-induced non-oscillatory transient
reflectivity signal. The obtained interface signal provides evidence for
ultrafast carrier injection from the Si substrate into the GaP overlayer. This
is also corroborated by examining the deviation of the polarization-dependence
of the GaP coherent optical phonon signal from that of the bulk semiconductor.

NVIDIA's tensor core, are built around accelerating the general matrix
multiplication (i.e., GEMM). However, supporting convolution on GEMM-based
accelerators is not trivial. The naive method explicitly lowers the convolution
to GEMM, commonly known as im2col, which introduces significant performance and
memory overhead. Existing implicit im2col algorithms require unscalable
hardware and are inefficient in supporting important convolution variants such
as strided convolution. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient and
hardware-friendly implicit im2col algorithm used by Google's TPU, which
dynamically converts a convolution into a GEMM with practically zero
performance and memory overhead, fully unleashing the power of GEMM engines.
Through comprehensive experimental results, we quantitatively argue that this
algorithm has been adopted in commercial closed-source platforms, and we are
the first to describe its high-level idea and implementation details. Finally,
we show that our algorithm can also be generally applied to Nvidia's Tensor

Recent advances in micro-video recommendation have achieved remarkable
performance in mining users' current preference based on historical behaviors.
However, most of them neglect the dynamic and time-evolving nature of users'
preference, and the prediction on future micro-videos with historically mined
preference may deteriorate the effectiveness of recommender systems. In this
paper, we propose the DMR framework to explicitly model dynamic multi-trends of
users' current preference and make predictions based on both the history and
future potential trends. We devise the DMR framework, which comprises: 1) the
implicit user network module which identifies sequence fragments from other
users with similar interests and extracts the sequence fragments that are
chronologically behind the identified fragments; 2) the multi-trend routing
module which assigns each extracted sequence fragment into a trend group and
update the corresponding trend vector; 3) the history-future trend prediction
module jointly uses the history preference vectors and future trend vectors to
yield the final click-through-rate. We validate the effectiveness of DMR over
multiple state-of-the-art micro-video recommenders on two publicly available
real-world datasets. Relatively extensive analysis further demonstrate the
superiority of modeling dynamic multi-trend for micro-video recommendation.

mechanistic problems, the black-box nature of conventional ML architectures
lacks the physical knowledge to infer unforeseen input conditions. This implies
both severe overfitting during a dearth of training data and inadequate
physical interpretability, which motivates us to propose a new kinematically
consistent, physics-based ML model. In particular, we attempt to perform
physically interpretable learning of inverse problems in wave propagation
without suffering overfitting restrictions. Towards this goal, we employ long
short-term memory (LSTM) networks endowed with a physical,
hyperparameter-driven regularizer, performing penalty-based enforcement of the
characteristic geometries. Since these characteristics are the kinematical
invariances of wave propagation phenomena, maintaining their structure provides
kinematical consistency to the network. Even with modest training data, the
kinematically consistent network can reduce the $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ error
norms of the plain LSTM predictions by about 45% and 55%, respectively. It can
also increase the horizon of the plain LSTM's forecasting by almost two times.
To achieve this, an optimal range of the physical hyperparameter, analogous to
an artificial bulk modulus, has been established through numerical experiments.
The efficacy of the proposed method in alleviating overfitting, and the
physical interpretability of the learning mechanism, are also discussed. Such
an application of kinematically consistent LSTM networks for wave propagation
learning is presented here for the first time.

for the item learn to bid using mean-based algorithms -- a large class of

Multiplicative Weights Update and Follow the Perturbed Leader. We completely
characterize the learning dynamics of mean-based algorithms, in terms of
convergence to a Nash equilibrium of the auction, in two senses: (1)
time-average: the fraction of rounds where bidders play a Nash equilibrium
approaches 1 in the limit; (2)last-iterate: the mixed strategy profile of
bidders approaches a Nash equilibrium in the limit. Specifically, the results
depend on the number of bidders with the highest value: - If the number is at
least three, the bidding dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium
of the auction, both in time-average and in last-iterate. - If the number is
two, the bidding dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium in
time-average but not necessarily in last-iterate. - If the number is one, the
bidding dynamics may not converge to a Nash equilibrium in time-average nor in

biologically plausible macroevolutionary model for phylogenetic trees where
times to speciation or extinction events are drawn from a Coxian phase-type
(PH) distribution. First, we show that different choices of parameters in our
model lead to a range of tree balances as measured by Aldous' $\beta$
statistic. In particular, we demonstrate that it is possible to find parameters
that correspond well to empirical tree balance. Next, we provide a natural
extension of the $\beta$ statistic to sets of trees. This extension produces
less biased estimates of $\beta$ compared to using the median $\beta$ values
from individual trees. Furthermore, we derive a likelihood expression for the
probability of observing any tree with branch lengths under a model with
speciation but no extinction. Finally, we illustrate the application of our
model by performing both absolute and relative goodness-of-fit tests for two
large empirical phylogenies (squamates and angiosperms) that compare models
with Coxian PH distributed times to speciation with models that assume
exponential or Weibull distributed waiting times. In our numerical analysis, we
found that, in most cases, models assuming a Coxian PH distribution provided
the best fit.

is a fundamental block of surgical navigation in Minimally Invasive Surgery

remains a challenge, and the online laparoscopic tracking primarily relies on
external sensors, which increases system complexity. Methods: Here, we propose
a learning-driven framework, in which an image-guided laparoscopic localization
with 3D reconstructions of complex anatomical structures is obtained. To
reconstruct the 3D structure of the whole surgical environment, we first
fine-tune a learning-based stereoscopic depth perception method, which is
robust to the texture-less and variant soft tissues, for depth estimation.
Then, we develop a dense visual reconstruction algorithm to represent the scene
by surfels, estimate the laparoscope poses and fuse the depth maps into a
unified reference coordinate for tissue reconstruction. To estimate poses of
new laparoscope views, we achieve a coarse-to-fine localization method, which
incorporates our reconstructed 3D model. Results: We evaluate the
reconstruction method and the localization module on three datasets, namely,
the stereo correspondence and reconstruction of endoscopic data (SCARED), the
ex-vivo phantom and tissue data collected with Universal Robot (UR) and Karl
Storz Laparoscope, and the in-vivo DaVinci robotic surgery dataset, where the
reconstructed 3D structures have rich details of surface texture with an

framework can be potentially extended to the current surgical navigation

case, we also relate the structure of the Picard scheme of $X$ with invariants
of singular points of $X$. To prove such a relation, we give a characterization

low-discrepancy sequence and the static solution to the multi-bodies problem in
high-dimensional space. An assumption that the static solution to the
multi-bodies problem is a low-discrepancy sequence is proposed. Considering the
static solution to the multi-bodies problem corresponds to the minimum
potential energy principle, we further assume that the distribution of the
bodies is the most uniform when the potential energy is the smallest. To verify
the proposed assumptions, a dynamical evolutionary model (DEM) based on the
minimum potential energy is established to find out the static solution. The
central difference algorithm is adopted to solve the DEM and an evolutionary
iterative scheme is developed. The selection of the mass and the damping
coefficient to ensure the convergence of the evolutionary iteration is
discussed in detail. Based on the DEM, the relationship between the potential
energy and the discrepancy during the evolutionary iteration process is
studied. It is found that there is a significant positive correlation between
them, which confirms the proposed assumptions. We also combine the DEM with the
restarting technique to generate a series of low-discrepancy sequences. These
sequences are unbiased and perform better than other low-discrepancy sequences
in terms of the discrepancy, the potential energy, integrating eight test
functions and computing the statistical moments for two practical stochastic
problems. Numerical examples also show that the DEM can not only generate
uniformly distributed sequences in cubes, but also in non-cubes.

are used to enhance the signal production cross-section. Low $\tan{\beta}$ and
equal Higgs masses regime is chosen in favor of Hadronic decay of $Z$ boson and
$H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$. Different signal scenarios are selected and event
generation is performed for each process separately. The $W$, $Z$ bosons, and
top quark backgrounds are also analyzed. Signal significance is computed at
each Higgs mass hypothesis for three signal processes. After a comprehensive
study, we did not find sizeable amount of signal events on top of the

into account the detector effects and systematics. The maximum calculated value
of signal significance is observed in the range of 150 $\leq$ $m_H$ $\leq$ 250

measure the self-coupling of triple Higgs in the Standard Model. By elongating
the Standard Model's scalar sector, using incipient Higgs doublet along with a
quadratic (Higgs) potential should reveal many incipient features of the model
and the possibility of the emergence of additional Higgs self-couplings. The
self-coupling of the Higgs boson helps in reconstructing the scalar potential.
The main objective of this paper is to extract Higgs self-coupling by
numerically analyzing several scattering processes governed by two Higgs
doublet models (2HDM). These scattering processes include various possible
combinations of final states in the triple Higgs sector. The determination of
production cross-section of scattering processes is carried out using two
different scenarios, with and without polarization of incoming beam and is
extended to a center of mass energy up to $\sqrt{s}$ = 3 $TeV$. The computation

is $m_H = m_{H^0} = m_{A^0} = m_{H^\pm}$. This choice is made to minimize the
oblique parameters. The decays of the final state of each process are
investigated to estimate the number of events at integrated luminosity of

applications, especially in dynamic PM. However, due to the shallow
depth-of-field (DOF) of a projector, more work is needed to ensure accurate
calibration. We aim to estimate the intrinsic parameters of a projector while
avoiding the limitation of shallow DOF. As the core of our technique, we
present a practical calibration device that requires a minimal working volume
directly in front of the projector lens regardless of the projector's focusing
distance and aperture size. The device consists of a flat-bed scanner and
pinhole-array masks. For calibration, a projector projects a series of
structured light patterns in the device. The pinholes directionally decompose
the structured light, and only the projected rays that pass through the
pinholes hit the scanner plane. For each pinhole, we extract a ray passing
through the optical center of the projector. Consequently, we regard the
projector as a pinhole projector that projects the extracted rays only, and we
calibrate the projector by applying the standard camera calibration technique,
which assumes a pinhole camera model. Using a proof-of-concept prototype, we
demonstrate that our technique can calibrate projectors with different focusing
distances and aperture sizes at the same accuracy as a conventional method.
Finally, we confirm that our technique can provide intrinsic parameters
accurate enough for a dynamic PM application, even when a projector is placed
too far from a projection target for a conventional method to calibrate the
projector using a fiducial object of reasonable size.

nature of gravitational attraction in Newton's theory. However, several
mechanisms break this isotropy like for instance their rotation generating a
centrifugal force, magnetic pressure or anisotropic equations of state. The
stellar surface therefore deviates slightly or significantly from a sphere
depending on the strength of these anisotropic perturbations. In this paper, we
compute analytical and numerical solutions of the electromagnetic field
produced by a rotating spheroidal star of oblate or prolate nature. This study
is particularly relevant for millisecond pulsars for which strong deformations
are produced by the rotation or a strong magnetic field, leading to indirect
observational signatures of the polar cap thermal X-ray emission. First we
solve the time harmonic Maxwell equations in vacuum by using oblate and prolate
spheroidal coordinates adapted to the stellar boundary conditions. The
solutions are expanded in series of radial and angular spheroidal wave
functions. Particular emphasize is put on the magnetic dipole radiation.
Second, we compute approximate solutions by integrating numerically the
time-dependent Maxwell equations in spheroidal coordinates. We show that the
spin down luminosity corrections compared to a perfect sphere are to leading
order given by terms involving $(a/r_L)^2$ and $(a/R)^2$ where $a$ is the
stellar oblateness or prolateness, $R$ the smallest star radius and $r_L$ the
light-cylinder radius. The corresponding perturbations in the electromagnetic
field are only perceptible close to the surface, deforming the polar cap rims.
At large distances $r\gg a$, the solution tends asymptotically to the perfect
spherical case of a rotating dipole.

experiments allows a researcher to empirically analyze in which type of
settings an algorithm performs best and to what degree under different metrics.
Not only do we defend this position, in this paper, we also offer a proposal of
how these simple and targeted experiments could be defined and shared and
suggest potential next steps to make this project a reality.

during maximum light of the perfectly sinusoidal optical}light curve shows
signatures much like members of the BE UMa variable family. These are post

more massive than found in other group members and the progenitor of the white

electronic systems such as very large-scale integration (VLSI) and printed
circuit boards (PCBs). The main challenge is that connecting a large number of
electronic components under specific design rules involves a very large search
space. Early solutions are typically designed with hard-coded heuristics, which
suffer from problems of non-optimal solutions and lack of flexibility for new
design needs. Although a few learning-based methods have been proposed
recently, they are typically cumbersome and hard to extend to large-scale
applications. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for circuit routing,
named Ranking Cost, which innovatively combines search-based methods (i.e., A*
algorithm) and learning-based methods (i.e., Evolution Strategies) to form an
efficient and trainable router. In our method, we introduce a new set of
variables called cost maps, which can help the A* router to find out proper
paths to achieve the global objective. We also train a ranking parameter, which
can produce the ranking order and further improve the performance of our
method. Our algorithm is trained in an end-to-end manner and does not use any
artificial data or human demonstration. In the experiments, we compare with the
sequential A* algorithm and a canonical reinforcement learning approach, and
results show that our method outperforms these baselines with higher
connectivity rates and better scalability.

smooth, but assumed neither convex in $x$ nor concave in $y$. Our approach
relies upon replacing the function $f(x,\cdot)$ with its $k$th order Taylor
approximation (in $y$) and finding a near-stationary point in the resulting
surrogate problem. To guarantee its success, we establish the following result:
let the Euclidean diameter of $Y$ be small in terms of the target accuracy
$\varepsilon$, namely $O(\varepsilon^{\frac{2}{k+1}})$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$
and $O(\varepsilon)$ for $k = 0$, with the constant factors controlled by
certain regularity parameters of $f$; then any $\varepsilon$-stationary point
in the surrogate problem remains $O(\varepsilon)$-stationary for the initial
problem. Moreover, we show that these upper bounds are nearly optimal: the
aforementioned reduction provably fails when the diameter of $Y$ is larger. For
$0 \le k \le 2$ the surrogate function can be efficiently maximized in $y$; our
general approximation result then leads to efficient algorithms for finding a

new granule segmenting method, which can detect both small faint and large
bright granules. A large number of granules were detected and two critical
sizes, 265 km and 1420 km, were found to separate the granules into three
length ranges. The granules with sizes above 1420 km follow Gaussian
distribution, and demonstrate ""flat"" in flatness function, which shows that
they are non-intermittent and thus are dominated by convective motions. Small
granules with sizes between 265 and 1420 km are fitted by a combination of
power law function and Gauss function, and exhibit non-linearity in flatness
function, which reveals that they are in the mixing motions of convection and
turbulence. Mini granules with sizes below 265 km follow power law distribution
and demonstrate linearity in flatness function, indicating that they are
intermittent and strongly turbulent. These results suggest that a cascade
process occurs: large granules break down due to convective instability, which
transport energy into small ones; then turbulence is induced and grows, which
competes with convection and further causes the small granules to continuously
split. Eventually, the motions in even smaller scales enter in a
turbulence-dominated regime.

high-level validation validates the concerns with stakeholders, whereas the

prediction of lightning in one season advance remained uncommon, owing to the
nature of the problem, which is short-lived local phenomenon. Here we show that
on the seasonal time scale, lightning over the major global hot-spot regions is
strongly tied with slowly varying global predictors (e.g., El Nino and Southern
Oscillation). Moreover, the sub-seasonal variance of lightning is highly
correlated with global predictors, suggesting a seminal role played by the
global climate mode in shaping the local land-atmosphere interactions, which
eventually affects seasonal lightning variability. It is shown that the
seasonal predictability of lightning over the hotspot is comparable to that of
seasonal rainfall, which opens up an avenue for reliable seasonal forecasting
of lightning for special awareness and preventive measures.

However, due to the overlook of inter-dependent knowledge across items (e.g.,

to distill the heterogeneous collaborative signals from both user and item
sides. In this work, we propose a Self-Supervised Metagraph Infor-max Network

metapath-guided heterogeneous graph neural network to aggregate feature
embeddings from different types of meta-relations across users and items,
em-powering SMIN to maintain dedicated representations for multi-faceted user-

signals, we generalize the mutual information learning paradigm under the
self-supervised graph-based collaborative filtering. This endows the expressive
modeling of user-item interactive patterns, by exploring global-level
collaborative relations and underlying isomorphic transformation property of
graph topology. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate

to mitigate global warming by reducing the concentration of this greenhouse gas
in the atmosphere. When CO$_2$ is injected in the geological formation, it
dissolves partially in the interstitial brine, thus rendering it denser than
the CO$_2$-devoid brine below, which creates a convective instability. The
resulting convection accelerates the rate of CO$_2$ perennial trapping by
dissolution in the brine. The instability and resulting convection have been
intensively discussed by numerical and theoretical approaches at the Darcy
scale, but few experimental studies have characterized them quantitatively. By
using both refractive index matching and planar laser induced fluorescence, we
measure for the first time the onset characteristics of the convective
dissolution instability in a 3-D porous medium located below a gas compartment.
Our results highlight that the dimensional growth rate of the instability
remains constant when the CO$_2$ partial pressure in the compartment is varied,
in clear discrepancy with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, within the
CO$_2$ partial pressure range studied, the measured growth rate is 1 to 3
orders of magnitude larger than the predicted value. The Fourier spectrum of
the front is very broad, highlighting the multi-scale nature of the flow.
Depending on the measurement method and CO$_2$ partial pressure, the mean
wavelength is 1 to 3 times smaller than the predicted value. Using a
theoretical model developed recently by Tilton (J.~Fluid Mech., 2018), we
demonstrate that our experimental results are consistent with a forcing of
convection by porosity fluctuations. Finally, we discuss the possible effects
of this forcing by the porous medium's pore structure on the CO$_2$ flux across
the interface, measured in our experiments about one order of magnitude higher
than expected.

processes in the pi-calculus as proof terms. This leads to a Curry-Howard
interpretation where proof reductions in the cut-elimination procedure
correspond to process reductions/interactions. The subexponentials in LL have
also played an important role in concurrent systems since they can be
interpreted in different ways, including timed, spatial and even epistemic

low signal-to-noise ratio and can be recorded for a limited time. Thus,
irrelevant information and faulty samples could affect the BCI performance.
Introducing a methodology that allows the extraction of informative components
from the EEG signal while maintaining its intrinsic characteristics, may
provide a solution to both the described issues: noisy data may be avoided by
having only relevant components and combining relevant components may represent
a good strategy to substitute the data without requiring long or repeated EEG

unobserved confounding factors. The proxies are divided into two sets that are
independent conditional on the confounders. One set of proxies are `negative
control treatments' and the other are `negative control outcomes'. Existing
work applies to low-dimensional settings with a fixed number of proxies and
confounders. In this work we consider linear models with many proxy controls
and possibly many confounders. A key insight is that if each group of proxies
is strictly larger than the number of confounding factors, then a matrix of
nuisance parameters has a low-rank structure and a vector of nuisance
parameters has a sparse structure. We can exploit the rank-restriction and
sparsity to reduce the number of free parameters to be estimated. The number of
unobserved confounders is not known a priori but we show that it is identified,
and we apply penalization methods to adapt to this quantity. We provide an
estimator with a closed-form as well as a doubly-robust estimator that must be
evaluated using numerical methods. We provide conditions under which our
doubly-robust estimator is uniformly root-$n$ consistent, asymptotically
centered normal, and our suggested confidence intervals have asymptotically
correct coverage. We provide simulation evidence that our methods achieve
better performance than existing approaches in high dimensions, particularly
when the number of proxies is substantially larger than the number of
confounders.

counteract the COVID-19 pandemic, sparking great interest from academia,
industry and public administrations worldwide. While most solutions have dealt
with these aspects separately, their combination would greatly benefit the
continuous monitoring of public spaces and help trigger effective
countermeasures. This work presents milliTRACE-IR, a joint mmWave radar and
infrared imaging sensing system performing unobtrusive and privacy preserving
human body temperature screening and contact tracing in indoor spaces.
milliTRACE-IR combines, via a robust sensor fusion approach, mmWave radars and
infrared thermal cameras. It achieves fully automated measurement of distancing
and body temperature, by jointly tracking the subjects's faces in the thermal
camera image plane and the human motion in the radar reference system.
Moreover, milliTRACE-IR performs contact tracing: a person with high body
temperature is reliably detected by the thermal camera sensor and subsequently
traced across a large indoor area in a non-invasive way by the radars. When
entering a new room, a subject is re-identified among several other individuals
by computing gait-related features from the radar reflections through a deep
neural network and using a weighted extreme learning machine as the final
re-identification tool. Experimental results, obtained from a real
implementation of milliTRACE-IR, demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in
distance/trajectory estimation, inter-personal distance estimation (effective
for subjects getting as close as 0.2 m), and accurate temperature monitoring

two different parallel additive substrate manufacturing methods can be
executed: capillary stamping and decal transfer microlithography. Under
moderate contact pressures, the porous phenolic resin stamps are used for
non-destructive ink transfer to substrates by capillary stamping. Continuous
ink supply through the pore systems to the contact surfaces of the porous
phenolic resin stamps enables multiple successive stamp-substrate contacts for
lithographic ink deposition under ambient conditions. No deterioration of the
quality of the deposited pattern occurs and no interruptions for ink
replenishment are required. Under high contact pressure, porous phenolic resin
stamps are used for decal transfer printing. In this way, the tips of the
stamps' contact elements are lithographically transferred to counterpart
substrates. The granular nature of the phenolic resin facilitates the rupture
of the contact elements upon stamp retraction. The deposited phenolic resin
micropatterns characterized by abundance of exposed hydroxyl groups are used as
generic anchoring sites for further application-specific functionalizations. As
example, we deposited phenolic resin micropatterns on quartz crystal
microbalance resonators and further functionalized them with polyethylenimine

vacancy reduces the 1s core electron binding energy of the first N neighbors by
$\sim$0.6 eV and that this effect is additive with respect to the number of
vacancies. Hence it is predicted that the Ti vacancy concentration can be
revealed from the intensity of the shifted components in the N 1s core spectra
region. This notion was critically appraised by fitting the N 1s region
obtained via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of
Ti$_{1-\delta}$O$_x$N$_{1-x}$ thin films deposited by high power pulsed
magnetron sputtering. A model to quantify the Ti vacancy concentration based on
the intensity ratio between the N 1s signal components, corresponding to N
atoms with locally different Ti vacancy concentration, was developed. Herein a
random vacancy distribution was assumed and the influence of surface oxidation
from atmospheric exposure after deposition was considered. The so estimated
vacancy concentrations are consistent with a model calculating the vacancy
concentration based on the O concentrations determined by elastic recoil
detection analysis and text book oxidation states and hence electroneutrality.
Thus, we have unequivocally established that the formation and population of Ti

computer vision tasks, especially in the fine-grained semantic segmentation
problem. To alleviate human efforts from expensive pixel-by-pixel annotations,
our method focuses on weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with
image-level tags, which are much easier to obtain. As a huge gap exists between
pixel-level segmentation and image-level labels, how to reflect the image-level
semantic information on each pixel is an important question. To explore the
congeneric semantic regions from the same class to the maximum, we construct
the patch-level graph neural network (P-GNN) based on the self-detected patches
from different images that contain the same class labels. Patches can frame the
objects as much as possible and include as little background as possible. The
graph network that is established with patches as the nodes can maximize the
mutual learning of similar objects. We regard the embedding vectors of patches
as nodes, and use transformer-based complementary learning module to construct
weighted edges according to the embedding similarity between different nodes.
Moreover, to better supplement semantic information, we propose
soft-complementary loss functions matched with the whole network structure. We
conduct experiments on the popular PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmarks, and our model

remains unanswered. This paper contributes to addressing this question by
studying the extent to which the distributed SGD algorithm, in the standard
parameter-server architecture, can learn an accurate model despite (a) a
fraction of the workers being malicious (Byzantine), and (b) the other
fraction, whilst being honest, providing noisy information to the server to
ensure differential privacy (DP). We first observe that the integration of
standard practices in DP and BR is not straightforward. In fact, we show that
many existing results on the convergence of distributed SGD under Byzantine
faults, especially those relying on $(\alpha,f)$-Byzantine resilience, are
rendered invalid when honest workers enforce DP. To circumvent this
shortcoming, we revisit the theory of $(\alpha,f)$-BR to obtain an approximate
convergence guarantee. Our analysis provides key insights on how to improve
this guarantee through hyperparameter optimization. Essentially, our
theoretical and empirical results show that (1) an imprudent combination of
standard approaches to DP and BR might be fruitless, but (2) by carefully
re-tuning the learning algorithm, we can obtain reasonable learning accuracy
while simultaneously guaranteeing DP and BR.

  This paper considers the existence or otherwise of isometric and

4-manifold $(M,g)$, such that $j$ is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita
connection of $g$. It is shown that if an isometric or anti-isometric almost

scalar curvature of the metric must be zero. In addition, it is found that $j$
is parallel iff the eigenplanes are tangent to a pair of mutually orthogonal
foliations by totally geodesic surfaces.
  The composition of a Riemannian metric with an isometric almost paracomplex
structure $j$ yields a neutral metric $g'$. It is proven that if $j$ is
parallel, then $g$ is Einstein iff $g'$ is conformally flat and scalar flat.
  The vanishing of the Hirzebruch signature is found to be a necessary
topological condition for a closed 4-manifold to admit an Einstein metric with
a parallel isometric paracomplex structure. Thus, while the K3 manifold admits
an Einstein metric with an isometric paracomplex structure, it cannot be
parallel. The same holds true for certain connected sums of complex projective

unique challenges that cannot be handled by current recommendation solutions.
In particular: i) complex inter-dependencies across different types of user
behaviors; ii) the incorporation of knowledge-aware item relations into the
multi-behavior recommendation framework; iii) dynamic characteristics of
multi-typed user-item interactions. To tackle these challenges, this work
proposes a Knowledge-Enhanced Hierarchical Graph Transformer Network (KHGT), to

Additionally, we further integrate the graph attention layer with the temporal

belts) is an open one. If solved, this understanding would provide valuable
insights into the architecture, dynamics, and formation of exoplanetary
systems. Recent observations by ALMA have revealed an apparent paradox in this
field, the presence of radially narrow belts in protoplanetary discs that are
likely the birthplaces of planetesimals, and exoKuiper belts nearly four times
as wide in mature systems. If the parent planetesimals of this type of debris
disc indeed form in these narrow protoplanetary rings via streaming instability
where dust is trapped, we propose that this width dichotomy could naturally
arise if these dust traps form planetesimals whilst migrating radially, e.g. as
caused by a migrating planet. Using the dust evolution software DustPy, we find
that if the initial protoplanetary disc and trap conditions favour planetesimal
formation, dust can still effectively accumulate and form planetesimals as the
trap moves. This leads to a positive correlation between the inward radial
speed and final planetesimal belt width, forming belts up to $\sim$100 au over
10 Myr of evolution. We show that although planetesimal formation is most
efficient in low viscosity ($\alpha = 10^{-4}$) discs with steep dust traps to
trigger the streaming instability, the large widths of most observed
planetesimal belts constrain $\alpha$ to values $\geq4\times 10^{-4}$ at tens
of au, otherwise the traps cannot migrate far enough. Additionally, the large
spread in the widths and radii of exoKuiper belts could be due to different
trap migration speeds (or protoplanetary disc lifetimes) and different starting
locations, respectively. Our work serves as a first step to link exoKuiper
belts and rings in protoplanetary discs.

the complexity of obtaining a meaningful mapping from weight-space to
function-space distributions in the transformer. Therefore, moving closer to

directly to the attention weights. We find that this proposed method performs

significant influence on the VUV photodesorption spectra of CH3CN, CHCN, HCN,
CN and CH3. Contrary to what has generally been evidenced for most of the
condensed molecules, these findings point toward a desorption process for which
the CH3CN molecule that absorbs the VUV photon is the one desorbing. It can be
ejected in the gas phase as intact CH3CN or in the form of its
photo-dissociation fragments. Astrophysical VUV photodesorption yields,
applicable to different locations, are derived and can be incorporated into
astrochemical modeling. They vary from 0.67(+/-0.33).10^{-5} to

being extremely small (i.e. of the order of a few fermi), it is almost
impossible to measure impact parameter in experiments. In this work, we
implement the ML-based regression technique via Gradient Boosting Decision
Trees (GBDT) to obtain a prediction of impact parameter in Pb-Pb collisions at

its successful implementation in small collision systems, transverse
spherocity, an event shape observable, holds an opportunity to reveal more

of any experimental exploration in this direction at the LHC yet, we suggest an
ML-based regression method to estimate centrality-wise transverse spherocity
distributions in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV by training the
model with minimum bias collision data. Throughout this work, we have used a
few final state observables as the input to the ML-model, which could be easily
made available from collision data. Our method seems to work quite well as we

analytically solved for the Hubble parameter, in a spatially flat FLRW universe
with dark energy and matter as components, and the solution traces the
evolutionary path from the prior decelerated to the late accelerated epoch.
Without interaction, the model predicts a $\Lambda$CDM like behavior with an
effective cosmological constant. We used Pantheon Supernovae type Ia,
observational Hubble data (OHD), cosmic microwave background (CMB), and baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) data to constrain the free parameters of the model.
The estimated values of the cosmological parameters were consistent with
observational results. We analyzed the behavior of the model using the
statefinder and $\omega^\prime_{e}-\omega_{e}$ plane where $\omega_{e}$ and
$\omega^\prime_{e}$ corresponds to the effective equation of state and its
evolution, respectively. The model shows a quintessence behavior in general,
and the model trajectory ends in a point that corresponds to the de Sitter
phase. We performed a dynamical analysis of the model, concluding that the
prior decelerated and late accelerated phases are unstable and stable
equilibria, respectively. We also investigated the thermodynamical nature of
the model and found that the generalized second law remains valid in the
dynamical vacuum treatment of the model.

Symbolic Register Automata (SRA). SRA extend the expressive power of symbolic
automata, by allowing Boolean formulas to be applied not only to the last
element read from the input string, but to multiple elements, stored in their
registers. SRA also extend register automata, by allowing arbitrary Boolean
formulas, besides equality predicates. We study the closure properties of SRA
under union, intersection, concatenation, Kleene closure, complement and
determinization and show that SRA, contrary to symbolic automata, are not in
general closed under complement and they are not determinizable. However, they
are closed under these operations when a window operator, quintessential in
Complex Event Recognition, is used. We show how SRA can be used in Complex
Event Recognition in order to detect patterns upon streams of events, using our
framework that provides declarative and compositional semantics, and that
allows for a systematic treatment of such automata. We also show how the
behavior of SRA, as they consume streams of events, can be given a
probabilistic description with the help of prediction suffix trees. This allows
us to go one step beyond Complex Event Recognition to Complex Event
Forecasting, where, besides detecting complex patterns, we can also efficiently
forecast their occurrence.

be annotated, existing attempts simply exploit image labels as supervision to
learn them, resulting in various contextual tricks, such as features pyramid,
context attention, etc. However, without carefully modeling the context's

we firstly introduce a latent generative model with a pair of correlated latent

reformulate the objective function of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), where
contextual features are learned as a posterior distribution conditioned on the

Transformer that takes the object's information as a reference and locates
correlated contextual factors. The effectiveness of our method is verified by

the goal is to find a set of efficient plans for a team of heterogeneous robots
to cover a given area. Within this application, solving a polygon partitioning
problem is an essential stepping stone. Unlike previous work, the problem
formulation proposed in this paper also considers a compactness metric of the
generated sub-polygons, in addition to the area size constraints. Maximizing
the compactness of sub-polygons directly influences the optimality of any

robotic tasks can be performed within each sub-region. The proposed problem
representation is based on grid cell decomposition and a potential field model
that allows for the use of standard optimization techniques. A new algorithm,
the AreaDecompose algorithm, is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm
includes a number of existing and new optimization techniques combined with two

results have been compared with a state-of-the-art algorithm. Results show that

driving, with attention on real-life human driving data and experimental
validation. In order to increase occupant's acceptance and gain drivers' trust,
the autonomous driving function needs to provide a both safe and comfortable
behavior such as risk-free and naturalistic driving. Our goal is to obtain such
behavior via imitation learning of a planning policy from human driving data.
In particular, we propose to incorporate barrier functions and smooth
spline-based motion parametrization in the training loss function. The
advantage is twofold: improving safety of the learning algorithm, while
reducing the amount of needed training data. Moreover, the behavior is learned
from highway driving data, which is collected consistently by a human driver
and then processed towards a specific driving scenario. For development
validation, a digital twin of the real test vehicle, sensors, and traffic
scenarios are reconstructed toward high-fidelity and physics-based modeling
technologies. These models are imported to simulation tools and co-simulated
with the proposed algorithm for validation and further testing. Finally, we
present experimental results and analyses, and compare with the conventional
imitation learning technique (behavioral cloning) to justify the proposed
development.

learning on network structured data. Although empirically successful, GCNs
exhibit certain behaviour that has no rigorous explanation -- for instance, the
performance of GCNs significantly degrades with increasing network depth,
whereas it improves marginally with depth using skip connections. This paper
focuses on semi-supervised learning on graphs, and explains the above
observations through the lens of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs). We derive NTKs
corresponding to infinitely wide GCNs (with and without skip connections).
Subsequently, we use the derived NTKs to identify that, with suitable
normalisation, network depth does not always drastically reduce the performance
of GCNs -- a fact that we also validate through extensive simulation.
Furthermore, we propose NTK as an efficient `surrogate model' for GCNs that
does not suffer from performance fluctuations due to hyper-parameter tuning
since it is a hyper-parameter free deterministic kernel. The efficacy of this
idea is demonstrated through a comparison of different skip connections for
GCNs using the surrogate NTKs.

propose a context engine to enhance a business process management (BPM)

change. The paper discusses context-awareness as the conceptual background. The
technological capabilities of business rules and complex event processing (CEP)

discussed in an exemplary application. The results provide an improvement over
the current situation of static variable instantiation of business processes
with local information. The proposed architecture extends the well-known
combination of business rules and BPM systems with a context engine based on
CEP. The resulting architecture for a BPM system using a context engine is
generic in nature and, hence, requires to be contextualized for situated
implementations. Implementation success is dependent on the availability of
context information and process compensation options. Practitioners receive
advice on a reference architecture and technology choices for implementing
systems, which can provide and monitor context information for business
processes as well as intervene and adapt the execution. Currently, there is no
multi-purpose non-proprietary context engine based on CEP or any other
technology available for BPM, which facilitates the adaptation of processes at

cultural heritage. A common approach is to capture an impulse response in a
hall and auralize it by convolving an input signal with the measured
reverberant response. For immersive applications, it is typical to acquire
spatial impulse responses using a spherical microphone array to capture the
reverberant sound field. While this allows a listener to freely rotate their
head from the captured location during reproduction, delicate considerations
must be made to allow a full six degrees of freedom auralization. Furthermore,
the computational cost of convolution with a high-order Ambisonics impulse
response remains prohibitively expensive for current real-time applications,
where most of the resources are dedicated towards rendering graphics. For this
reason, simplifications are often made in the reproduction of reverberation,
such as using a uniform decay around the listener. However, recent work has
highlighted the importance of directional characteristics in the late
reverberant sound field and more efficient reproduction methods have been
developed. In this article, we propose a framework that extracts directional
decay properties from a set of captured spatial impulse responses to
characterize a directional feedback delay network. For this purpose, a data set

learning-aided GOMIMO (DeepGOMIMO) framework for GOMIMO systems, where channel
state information (CSI)-free blind detection can be enabled by employing a
specially designed deep neural network (DNN)-based MIMO detector. The CSI-free
blind DNN detector mainly consists of two modules: one is the pre-processing
module which is designed to address both the path loss and channel crosstalk
issues caused by MIMO transmission, and the other is the feed-forward DNN
module which is used for joint detection of spatial and constellation
information by learning the statistics of both the input signal and the
additive noise. Our simulation results clearly verify that, in a typical indoor
4 $\times$ 4 MIMO-OWC system using both generalized optical spatial modulation
(GOSM) and generalized optical spatial multiplexing (GOSMP) with unipolar
non-zero 4-ary pulse amplitude modulation (4-PAM) modulation, the proposed
CSI-free blind DNN detector achieves near the same bit error rate (BER)
performance as the optimal joint maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, but with
much reduced computational complexity. Moreover, since the CSI-free blind DNN
detector does not require instantaneous channel estimation to obtain accurate
CSI, it enjoys the unique advantages of improved achievable data rate and
reduced communication time delay in comparison to the CSI-based zero-forcing
DNN (ZF-DNN) detector.

interconnection, have the potential to reduce variation in electricity prices
between different future scenarios, therefore reducing investment risk.
Moreover, investment in flexibility options can lower the need for generation
capacity. However, there are complex interactions between different flexibility
options. In this paper, we investigate the interactions between flexibility and
investment risk in electricity markets. We employ a large-scale stochastic
transmission and generation expansion model of the European electricity system.
Using this model, we first investigate the effect of risk aversion on the
investment decisions. We find that the interplay of parameters leads to (i)
more investment in a less emission-intensive energy system if planners are risk
averse (hedging against CO2 price uncertainty) and (ii) constant total
installed capacity, regardless of the level of risk aversion (planners do not
hedge against demand and RES deployment uncertainties). Second, we investigate
the individual effects of three flexibility elements on optimal investment
levels under different levels of risk aversion: demand response, investment in
additional interconnection capacity and investment in additional energy
storage. We find that that flexible technologies have a higher value for
risk-averse decision-makers, although the effects are nonlinear. Finally, we
investigate the interactions between the flexibility elements. We find that
risk-averse decision-makers show a strong preference for transmission grid
expansion once flexibility is available at low cost levels.

not have access to true distributions, we propose a data-driven approach using
variational autoencoder (VAE)-based joint source channel coding (JSCC). We show
through simulations with the colored MNIST dataset that our approach provides
high reconstruction quality at the receiver while confusing the eavesdropper
about the latent sensitive attribute, which consists of the color and thickness
of the digits. Finally, we consider a parallel-channel scenario, and show that
our approach arranges the information transmission such that the channels with
higher noise levels at the eavesdropper carry the sensitive information, while
the non-sensitive information is transmitted over more vulnerable channels.

plane. Giant planets are expected to form with near-zero obliquities. After its
formation, some dynamical mechanism must therefore have tilted Saturn up to its
current obliquity of 26.7{\deg}. This event is traditionally thought to have
happened more than 4 Gyrs ago during the late planetary migration because of
the crossing of a resonance between the spin-axis precession of Saturn and the
nodal orbital precession mode of Neptune. Here, we show that the fast tidal
migration of Titan measured by Lainey et al. (2020) is incompatible with this
scenario, and that it offers a new explanation for Saturn's current obliquity.
A significant migration of Titan would prevent any early resonance,
invalidating previous constraints on the late planetary migration set by the
tilting of Saturn. We propose instead that the resonance was encountered
recently, about 1 Gyr ago, forcing Saturn's obliquity to increase from a small
value (possibly less than 3{\deg}), up to its current state. This scenario
suggests that Saturn's normalised polar moment of inertia lies between 0.224
and 0.237. Our findings bring out a new paradigm for the spin-axis evolution of
Saturn, Jupiter, and possibly giant exoplanets in multiple systems, whereby
obliquities are not settled once for all, but continuously evolve as a result
of the migration of their satellites.

find that: (1) Simulations agree with analytic linear stability analysis only
under stringent conditions. They display surprisingly strong non-linear
coupling between the different modes, even for small mode amplitudes ($\sim
1\%$). (2) We demonstrate that the wiggle instability originates from a
combination of two physically distinct mechanisms: the first is the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the second is the amplification of
infinitesimal perturbations from repeated shock passages. These two mechanisms
can operate simultaneously, and which mechanism dominates depends on the
underlying parameters. (3) We explore the parameter space and study the
properties of spurs/feathers generated by the wiggle instability. The wiggle
instability is highly sensitive to the underlying parameters. The feather
separation decreases, and the growth rate increases, with decreasing sound
speed, increasing potential strength and decreasing interarm distance. (4) We
compare our simulations with a sample of 20 galaxies in the HST Archival Survey

instability is able to reproduce the typical range of feather separations seen
in observations. It remains unclear how the wiggle instability relates to
competing mechanisms for spur/feather formation such as the magneto-jeans
instability and the stochastic accumulation of gas due to correlated supernova
feedback.

auxiliary CTC losses applied to intermediate layers, where the vocabulary size
of each target subword sequence is gradually increased as the layer becomes
close to the word-level output. Here, we make each level of sequence prediction
explicitly conditioned on the previous sequences predicted at lower levels.
With the proposed approach, we expect the proposed model to learn the
word-level representations effectively by exploiting a hierarchy of linguistic
structures. Experimental results on LibriSpeech-{100h, 960h} and TEDLIUM2
demonstrate that the proposed model improves over a standard CTC-based model
and other competitive models from prior work. We further analyze the results to
confirm the effectiveness of the intended representation learning with our

works mainly focus on a single-source single-target setting, which cannot

this paper, we investigate open compound domain adaptation (OCDA), which deals
with mixed and novel situations at the same time, for semantic segmentation. We
present a novel framework based on three main design principles: discover,
hallucinate, and adapt. The scheme first clusters compound target data based on
style, discovering multiple latent domains (discover). Then, it hallucinates
multiple latent target domains in source by using image-translation
(hallucinate). This step ensures the latent domains in the source and the
target to be paired. Finally, target-to-source alignment is learned separately
between domains (adapt). In high-level, our solution replaces a hard OCDA
problem with much easier multiple UDA problems. We evaluate our solution on

symmetries. For the case of considering only the particle-conserving and
singlet configurations, we reduce the qubit count to an upper bound of
$\mathcal O(m\log_2N)$, where $m$ is the number of particles. This QEE scheme
is demonstrated on an H$_2$ molecule in the 6-31G basis set and a LiH molecule
in the STO-3G basis set using fewer qubits than the common encoding methods. We
calculate the ground-state energy surfaces using a variational quantum
eigensolver algorithm with a hardware-efficient ansatz circuit. We choose to
use a hardware-efficient ansatz since most of the Hilbert space in our scheme
is spanned by desired configurations so a heuristic search for an eigenstate is
sensible. The simulations are performed on IBM Quantum machines and the Qiskit
simulator with a noise model implemented from a IBM Quantum machine. Using the
methods of measurement error mitigation and error-free linear extrapolation, we
demonstrate that most of the distributions of the extrapolated energies using
our QEE scheme agree with the exact results obtained by Hamiltonian
diagonalization in the given basis sets within chemical accuracy. Our proposed
scheme and results show the feasibility of quantum simulations for larger
molecular systems in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

uncertain. Yield predictions for massive stars are almost exclusively based on
single star models, even though a large fraction interact with a binary
companion. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we predict the carbon ejected
in the winds and supernovae of single and binary-stripped stars at solar
metallicity. We find that binary-stripped stars are twice as efficient at
producing carbon (1.5-2.6 times, depending on choices on the slope of the
initial mass function and black hole formation). We confirm that this is
because the convective helium core recedes in stars that have lost their
hydrogen envelope, as noted previously. The shrinking of the core disconnects
the outermost carbon-rich layers created during the early phase of helium
burning from the more central burning regions. The same effect prevents carbon
destruction, even when the supernova shock wave passes. The yields are
sensitive to the treatment of mixing at convective boundaries, specifically
during carbon-shell burning (variations up to 40%) and improving upon this
should be a central priority for more reliable yield predictions. The yields
are robust (variations less than 0.5%) across our range of explosion
assumptions. Black hole formation assumptions are also important, implying that
the stellar graveyard now explored by gravitational-wave detections may yield
clues to better understand the cosmic carbon production. Our findings also
highlight the importance of accounting for binary-stripped stars in chemical
yield predictions and motivates further studies of other products of binary
interactions.

magnetic field of a filament channel above a polarity inversion line (PIL).
During the flare, this shear field becomes the so-called reconnection guide
field (i.e., the non-reconnecting component), which has been shown to play a
major role in determining key properties of the reconnection including the
efficiency of particle acceleration. We present new high-resolution,
three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamics simulations that reveal the detailed
evolution of the magnetic shear/guide field throughout an eruptive flare. The
magnetic shear evolves in three distinct phases: shear first builds up in a
narrow region about the PIL, then expands outward to form a thin vertical
current sheet, and finally is transferred by flare reconnection into an arcade
of sheared flare loops and an erupting flux rope. We demonstrate how the guide
field may be inferred from observations of the sheared flare loops. Our results
indicate that initially the guide field is larger by about a factor of 5 than
the reconnecting component, but it weakens by more than an order of magnitude

datasets of environment transitions to learn control policies, circumventing
the need for potentially expensive or unsafe online data collection.
Significant progress has been made recently in offline model-based
reinforcement learning, approaches which leverage a learned dynamics model.
This typically involves constructing a probabilistic model, and using the model
uncertainty to penalize rewards where there is insufficient data, solving for a
pessimistic MDP that lower bounds the true MDP. Existing methods, however,
exhibit a breakdown between theory and practice, whereby pessimistic return
ought to be bounded by the total variation distance of the model from the true
dynamics, but is instead implemented through a penalty based on estimated model
uncertainty. This has spawned a variety of uncertainty heuristics, with little
to no comparison between differing approaches. In this paper, we compare these
heuristics, and design novel protocols to investigate their interaction with
other hyperparameters, such as the number of models, or imaginary rollout
horizon. Using these insights, we show that selecting these key hyperparameters
using Bayesian Optimization produces superior configurations that are vastly
different to those currently used in existing hand-tuned state-of-the-art
methods, and result in drastically stronger performance.

monotonic tensile loading in order to reveal their tensile stress-strain
behaviour, recoverability, tensile strength, and elongation at break. The
syntactic foam under study here consists of hollow thermoplastic microspheres
(HTMs) of two distinct grades (551 and 920), with distributions of mean-wall
thicknesses and diameters, embedded inside a polyurethane matrix in various
volume fractions. Cyclic loading-unloading curves are recorded, revealing the
level of viscoelasticity exhibited by the materials (which becomes a stronger
effect with increasing volume fractions of HTMs) and indicating the level of
repeatability of loading under large strain. Samples are also subjected to
monotonic tensile loading in order to study their elongation at break. Higher
volume fractions of HTMs increase the stiffness of the material and whilst it
is observed that the materials are highly elastic over a wide range of tensile
strains, damage arises at lower levels of strain for more highly filled
materials. The HTM syntactic foams thus exhibit lower breaking strains compared
to the neat matrix, which is attributed to matrix-microsphere interfacial
debonding. Furthermore, by employing optimization techniques, linear elastic
properties of the microspheres and an average shell thickness of the 551 grade
are inferred by comparing experimental results to predictions from the
Generalized Self-Consistent Method, incorporating polydispersity data on the
size distribution of the microspheres. These results complement previous work
which involved direct experimental measurements of the 920 grade shell
thickness. Results also indicate that the characterization of microsphere
properties is not critically dependent on access to high resolution microsphere
diameter distribution data, provided that an accurate representative mean
diameter is known.

non-linear, whereas they are exclusively linear in the BEM-part to guarantee
the existence of a fundamental solution. First, the weak problem is formulated
in quotient spaces to avoid resolving to a saddle point problem. Second, we
establish in this setting well-posedness of the arising problem using the
framework of Lipschitz and strongly monotone operators as well as a stability
result for a special type of non-linearity, which is typically considered in
magnetostatic applications. Then, the discretization is performed in the

basis of observed covariates are common across the sciences. They are
frequently developed with the intent of avoiding the outcome in question by
intervening in response to estimated risks. Since risk scores are usually
developed in complex systems, interventions usually take the form of expert
agents responding to estimated risks as they best see fit. In this case,
interventions may be complex and their effects difficult to observe or infer,
meaning that explicit specification of interventions in response to risk scores
is impractical. Scope to modulate the aggregate model-intervention scheme so as
to optimise an objective is hence limited. We propose an algorithm by which a
model-intervention scheme can be developed by 'stacking' possibly unknown
intervention effects. By repeatedly observing and updating the intervention and
model, we show that this scheme leads to convergence or almost-convergence of
eventual outcome risk to an equivocal value for any initial value of
covariates. Our approach deploys a series of risk scores to expert agents, with
instructions to act on them in succession according to their best judgement.
Our algorithm uses only observations of pre-intervention covariates and the
eventual outcome as input. It is not necessary to know or infer the effect of
the intervention, other than making a general assumption that it is
'well-intentioned'. The algorithm can also be used to safely update risk scores
in the presence of unknown interventions and concept drift. We demonstrate
convergence of expectation of outcome in a range of settings and show
robustness to errors in risk estimation and to concept drift. We suggest
several practical applications and demonstrate a potential implementation by
simulation, showing that the algorithm leads to a fair distribution of outcome
risk across a population.

may be untenable and also not possible to formally test. However, the validity
of this assumption is evaluated in a sensitivity analysis, where data on the

differential cross sections (DDCSs) are often used to identify ionization
mechanisms because they exhibit features that distinguish close collisions from
grazing collisions. In the angular DDCS, a sharp peak indicates ionization
through a close binary collision, while a broad angular distribution points to
a grazing collision. In the DDCS energy spectrum, electrons ejected through a
binary encounter collision result in peak at an energy predicted from momentum
conservation. These insights into ionization processes are well-established for
plane wave projectiles. However, the recent development of sculpted particle
wave packets reopens the question of how ionization occurs for these new
particle wave forms. We present theoretical DDCSs for (e,2e) ionization of
atomic hydrogen for electron vortex projectiles. Our results predict that the
ionization mechanism for vortex projectiles is similar to that of non-vortex
projectiles, but that features in the DDCS that distinguish ionization

the projectile's non-zero transverse momentum increases the cross section for

fragment a bubble shell faster due to a strongly time-dependent RT instability,
causing the classical constant gravity models to fail. We derive the
time-dependent instability criteria analytically for the cases of constant,
exponential, and power-law accelerations, verifying them through
high-resolution numerical simulations. Our results show that (1) even in the
linear phase there is a term opposing exponential growth, (2) non-linear growth
approaches asymptotically the solution found by Fermi and von Neumann, (3) the
interpenetrating spikes and bubbles promote a significant mixing, with the
fractal dimension of the interface approaching 1.6, only limited by numerical
diffusion, and (4) the probability density function (PDF) for the passive
scalar to study mixing becomes increasingly sharper peaked for power-law and
exponential acceleration. Applying our solutions to stellar wind bubbles, young
supernova remnants (SNRs), and superbubbles (SBs), we find that the growth rate
of the RT instability is generally higher in the shells of wind-blown bubbles
in a power-law stratified medium than in those with power-law rising stellar
mechanical luminosities, Tycho-like than Cas A-like SNRs, and one-sided than
symmetric SBs. The recently observed eROSITA bubbles indicate smooth rim
surfaces, implying that the outer shell has not been affected by RT
instabilities. Therefore the dynamical evolution of the bubbles suggests
maximum final ages that are significantly above their current age, which we
estimate to be about 20 Myr.

learning, and other data-driven modeling frameworks. Although this shift in

real-time control by lowering the computational burden, training deep learning
models needs a huge amount of data. This big data is not always available for
scientific problems and leads to poorly generalizable data-driven models. This
gap can be furnished by leveraging information from physics-based models.
Exploiting prior knowledge about the problem at hand, this study puts forth a
concatenated neural network approach to build more tailored, effective, and
efficient machine learning models. For our analysis, without losing its
generalizability and modularity, we focus on the development of predictive
models for laminar and turbulent boundary layer flows. In particular, we
combine the self-similarity solution and power-law velocity profile
(low-fidelity models) with the noisy data obtained either from experiments or
computational fluid dynamics simulations (high-fidelity models) through a
concatenated neural network. We illustrate how the knowledge from these
simplified models results in reducing uncertainties associated with deep
learning models. The proposed framework produces physically consistent models
that attempt to achieve better generalization than data-driven models obtained
purely based on data. While we demonstrate our framework for a problem relevant
to fluid mechanics, its workflow and principles can be adopted for many
scientific problems where empirical models are prevalent. In line with grand
demands in novel physics-guided machine learning principles, this work builds a
bridge between extensive physics-based theories and data-driven modeling
paradigms and paves the way for using hybrid modeling approaches for

method provides experimentalists with a simple quantitative procedure for
calculating how large the systematic error caused by a particular wire
asymmetry will be. We show calculations of two useful cases: a straight wire
with a single bend of arbitrary angle and a wire that forms a circle. We find
that the amplitude of the in-phase temperature oscillations near a wire that
forms a circle differs from the prediction using the analytic straight-line
source solution by $<$12%, provided that the thermal penetration depth is less
than ten times the radius of curvature of the wire path. The in-phase

distributes data uniformly asymptotically while using the same communication

that generate accurate predictions of complex nonlinear system dynamics over

this challenge by formulating multi-step prediction as a sequence-to-sequence
modeling problem. We present End2End-TCN: a fully convolutional architecture
that integrates future control inputs to compute multi-step motion predictions
in one forward pass. We demonstrate the approach with a thorough analysis of
TCN performance for the quadrotor modeling task, which includes an
investigation of scaling effects and ablation studies. Ultimately, End2End-TCN
provides 55% error reduction over the state of the art in multi-step prediction
on an aggressive indoor quadrotor flight dataset. The model yields accurate

backgrounds, who may not only be segregated but have characteristic mobility
patterns in the city. While mobility is driven by individual needs and
preferences, the specific choice of venues to visit is usually constrained by
the socioeconomic status of people. The complex interplay between people and
places they visit, given their personal attributes and homophily leaning, is a
key mechanism behind the emergence of socioeconomic stratification patterns
ultimately leading to urban segregation at large. Here we investigate mixing
patterns of mobility in the twenty largest cities of the United States by
coupling individual check-in data from the social location platform Foursquare
with census information from the American Community Survey. We find strong
signs of stratification indicating that people mostly visit places in their own
socioeconomic class, occasionally visiting locations from higher classes. The
intensity of this `upwards bias' increases with socioeconomic status and
correlates with standard measures of racial residential segregation. Our
results indicate an even stronger socioeconomic segregation in individual
mobility than one would expect from system-level distributions, shedding
further light on uneven mobility mixing patterns in cities.

  Players Sample-Efficiently?",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-agent reinforcement learning has made substantial empirical progresses
in solving games with a large number of players. However, theoretically, the
best known sample complexity for finding a Nash equilibrium in general-sum
games scales exponentially in the number of players due to the size of the
joint action space, and there is a matching exponential lower bound. This paper
investigates what learning goals admit better sample complexities in the
setting of $m$-player general-sum Markov games with $H$ steps, $S$ states, and
$A_i$ actions per player. First, we design algorithms for learning an
$\epsilon$-Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5S\max_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^2)$ episodes, and an
$\epsilon$-Correlated Equilibrium (CE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^6S\max_{i\le m} A_i^2 / \epsilon^2)$ episodes. This
is the first line of results for learning CCE and CE with sample complexities
polynomial in $\max_{i\le m} A_i$. Our algorithm for learning CE integrates an
adversarial bandit subroutine which minimizes a weighted swap regret, along
with several novel designs in the outer loop. Second, we consider the important
special case of Markov Potential Games, and design an algorithm that learns an
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium within
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(S\sum_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^3)$ episodes (when only
highlighting the dependence on $S$, $A_i$, and $\epsilon$), which only depends
linearly in $\sum_{i\le m} A_i$ and significantly improves over existing
efficient algorithm in the $\epsilon$ dependence. Overall, our results shed
light on what equilibria or structural assumptions on the game may enable
sample-efficient learning with many players.

allows us to analyze the resources (space, space-time, cumulative space)
necessary to evaluate a function $f$ with a static data-dependency graph $G$.
Of particular interest in the field of cryptography are data-independent
memory-hard functions $f_{G,H}$ which are defined by a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) $G$ and a cryptographic hash function $H$. The pebbling complexity of the
graph $G$ characterizes the amortized cost of evaluating $f_{G,H}$ multiple
times as well as the total cost to run a brute-force preimage attack over a
fixed domain $\mathcal{X}$, i.e., given $y \in \{0,1\}^*$ find $x \in
\mathcal{X}$ such that $f_{G,H}(x)=y$. While a classical attacker will need to
evaluate the function $f_{G,H}$ at least $m=|\mathcal{X}|$ times a quantum
attacker running Grover's algorithm only requires $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{m})$
blackbox calls to a quantum circuit $C_{G,H}$ evaluating the function
$f_{G,H}$. Thus, to analyze the cost of a quantum attack it is crucial to
understand the space-time cost (equivalently width times depth) of the quantum
circuit $C_{G,H}$. We first observe that a legal black pebbling strategy for
the graph $G$ does not necessarily imply the existence of a quantum circuit
with comparable complexity -- in contrast to the classical setting where any
efficient pebbling strategy for $G$ corresponds to an algorithm with comparable
complexity evaluating $f_{G,H}$. Motivated by this observation we introduce a
new parallel reversible pebbling game which captures additional restrictions
imposed by the No-Deletion Theorem in Quantum Computing. We apply our new
reversible pebbling game to analyze the reversible space-time complexity of
several important graphs: Line Graphs, Argon2i-A, Argon2i-B, and DRSample. (See

  perturbations","Full version of TACAS'22 submission",,,,"eess.SY cs.FL cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Control systems should enforce a desired property for both expected modeled
situations as well as unexpected unmodeled environmental situations. Existing
methods focus on designing controllers to enforce the desired property only
when the environment behaves as expected. However, these methods lack
discussion on how the system behaves when the environment is perturbed. In this
paper, we propose an approach for analyzing control systems with respect to
their tolerance against environmental perturbations. A control system tolerates
certain environmental perturbations when it remains capable of guaranteeing the
desired property despite the perturbations. Each controller inherently has a
level of tolerance against environmental perturbations. We formally define this
notion of tolerance and describe a general technique to compute it, for any
given regular property. We also present a more efficient method to compute
tolerance with respect to invariance properties. Moreover, we introduce a new
controller synthesis problem based on our notion of tolerance. We demonstrate
the application of our framework on an autonomous surveillance example.

  3 and 4) and corresponding text",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain adaptation (DA) aims to alleviate the domain shift between source
domain and target domain. Most DA methods require access to the source data,
but often that is not possible (e.g. due to data privacy or intellectual
property). In this paper, we address the challenging source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) problem, where the source pretrained model is adapted to the
target domain in the absence of source data. Our method is based on the
observation that target data, which might no longer align with the source
domain classifier, still forms clear clusters. We capture this intrinsic
structure by defining local affinity of the target data, and encourage label
consistency among data with high local affinity. We observe that higher
affinity should be assigned to reciprocal neighbors, and propose a self
regularization loss to decrease the negative impact of noisy neighbors.
Furthermore, to aggregate information with more context, we consider expanded
neighborhoods with small affinity values. In the experimental results we verify
that the inherent structure of the target features is an important source of
information for domain adaptation. We demonstrate that this local structure can
be efficiently captured by considering the local neighbors, the reciprocal
neighbors, and the expanded neighborhood. Finally, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several 2D image and 3D point cloud recognition datasets. Code
is available in https://github.com/Albert0147/SFDA_neighbors.

demonstrate that this transition is controlled solely by a non-dimensional

lengths. A critical value of this number ${\mathcal{H}} \simeq 30$ can be
linked to a locking of the fibers together as the tensile strength is reached.
This critical value imposes that yarns must be very slender structures with a
given pitch. It also induces the existence of an optimal yarn radius.
Predictions of our theory are successfully compared to yarns made from natural
cotton fibers.

dual to the matter fields, and their cubic interactions, are sensitive to
properties of the background and the theory it is embedded in. The properties
that have the most striking effect are whether the background is supersymmetric
or not, and if the theory is gauged or ungauged. Interesting effects are due to
the appearance of operators with $\Delta < 2$, which depending on the
background can lead to, for instance, instabilities or extremal correlators.
The resulting differences will have an imprint on the quantum nature of the
microstates of near-extremal black holes, reflecting that not all extremal

symmetric $(N\times N)$ Gaussian random matrix and $\sqrt{T}$ measures the
strength of pairwise interaction between different species. Unlike in May's
original homogeneous model, each species has now an intrinsic damping $a_i$
that may differ from one another. As the interaction strength $T$ increases,
the system undergoes a phase transition from a stable phase to an unstable
phase at a critical value $T=T_c$. We reinterpret the probability of stability
in terms of the hitting time of the level $b=0$ of an associated Dyson Brownian
Motion (DBM), starting at the initial position $a_i$ and evolving in `time'
$T$. In the large $N \to \infty$ limit, using this DBM picture, we are able to
completely characterize $T_c$ for arbitrary density $\mu(a)$ of the $a_i$'s.
For a specific flat configuration $a_i = 1 + \sigma \frac{i-1}{N}$, we obtain
an explicit parametric solution for the limiting (as $N\to \infty$) spectral
density for arbitrary $T$ and $\sigma$. For finite but large $N$, we also
compute the large deviation properties of the probability of stability on the

for the transition between superdiffusion and diffusion caused by the addition
of a rest state. The emergence of superdiffusion depends on both the parameter
representing the strength of self-reinforcement and the ratio between mean
running and resting times. The mean running time must be at least $2/3$ of the
mean resting time for superdiffusion to be possible. Monte Carlo simulations
validate this theoretical result. This work demonstrates the possibility of
extending the telegrapher's (or Cattaneo) equation by adding self-reinforcing

heavily use {\it spurious} features for their predictions. Focusing on image
classifications, we define {\it core features} as the set of visual features
that are always a part of the object definition while {\it spurious features}
are the ones that are likely to {\it co-occur} with the object but not a part
of it (e.g., attribute ""fingers"" for class ""band aid""). Traditional methods for
discovering spurious features either require extensive human annotations (thus,
not scalable), or are useful on specific models. In this work, we introduce a
{\it general} framework to discover a subset of spurious and core visual
features used in inferences of a general model and localize them on a large
number of images with minimal human supervision. Our methodology is based on
this key idea: to identify spurious or core \textit{visual features} used in
model predictions, we identify spurious or core \textit{neural features}
(penultimate layer neurons of a robust model) via limited human supervision
(e.g., using top 5 activating images per feature). We then show that these
neural feature annotations {\it generalize} extremely well to many more images
{\it without} any human supervision. We use the activation maps for these
neural features as the soft masks to highlight spurious or core visual
features. Using this methodology, we introduce the {\it Salient Imagenet}
dataset containing core and spurious masks for a large set of samples from
Imagenet. Using this dataset, we show that several popular Imagenet models rely
heavily on various spurious features in their predictions, indicating the
standard accuracy alone is not sufficient to fully assess model performance.

randomly initialized weights, which results in a single network evaluation in
seconds.Second, a complexity metric is adopted for multi-objective NAS to
balance the model size and performance. Overall, our proposed method obtains a
set of efficient models with state-of-the-art performance in two real-world
search spaces. Then the results obtained on the CIFAR-10 dataset are
transferred to the ImageNet dataset to validate the practicality of the
proposed algorithm. Moreover, ablation studies on NAS-Bench-301 datasets reveal
the effectiveness of the proposed RWE in estimating the performance compared

multi-view data. To make full use of the multi-view data, multi-view learning
plays an increasingly important role. Traditional multi-view learning methods
rely on a large number of labeled and completed multi-view data. However, it is
expensive and time-consuming to obtain a large number of labeled multi-view
data in real-world applications. Moreover, multi-view data is often incomplete
because of data collection failures, self-deficiency, or other reasons.
Therefore, we may have to face the problem of fewer labeled and incomplete
multi-view data in real application scenarios. In this paper, a transductive
semi-supervised incomplete multi-view TSK fuzzy system modeling method
(SSIMV_TSK) is proposed to address these challenges. First, in order to
alleviate the dependency on labeled data and keep the model interpretable, the
proposed method integrates missing view imputation, pseudo label learning of
unlabeled data, and fuzzy system modeling into a single process to yield a
model with interpretable fuzzy rules. Then, two new mechanisms, i.e. the
bidirectional structural preservation of instance and label, as well as the
adaptive multiple alignment collaborative learning, are proposed to improve the
robustness of the model. The proposed method has the following distinctive
characteristics: 1) it can deal with the incomplete and few labeled multi-view
data simultaneously; 2) it integrates the missing view imputation and model
learning as a single process, which is more efficient than the traditional
two-step strategy; 3) attributed to the interpretable fuzzy inference rules,
this method is more interpretable. Experimental results on real datasets show
that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art

to even state-of-the-art deep neural networks outputting incorrect answers with

improve the security and robustness of the models and avoid them being

formed, in which both players would attempt to play their best strategies
against each other while maximizing their own payoffs. To solve the game, each
player would choose an optimal strategy against the opponent based on the
prediction of the opponent's strategy choice. In this work, we are on the
defensive side to apply game-theoretic approaches on defending against attacks.
We use two randomization methods, random initialization and stochastic

preprocessing images before attacks. Our experimental results indicate that
those three methods can effectively improve the robustness of deep-learning

dynamics under the presence of model errors is examined. We show that
multiplicative inflation significantly impacts the alignment of ensemble
anomalies onto the backward Lyapunov vectors. Whereas the ensemble is expected
to collapse onto the subspace corresponding to the unstable portions of the
Lyapunov spectrum, the use of multiplicative inflation contributes to retain
anomalies beyond that span. Given that model error implies that analysis error
is not fully confined on the local unstable subspace, this uncovered feature of
multiplicative inflation is of paramount importance for an optimal filtering.
We propose hybrid schemes whereby additive perturbations complement
multiplicative inflation by suitably increasing the dimension of the subspace
spanned by the ensemble. The use of hybrid schemes improves analysis RMSE on
the Lorenz-96 model compared to the use of multiplicative inflation alone,
emphasizing the role of model dynamics when designing additive inflation
schemes.

the effect of non-Hermiticity on the topological boundary modes and topological
pumping. For weak and moderate values of $\gamma$, the inherent topological
edge modes remain localized at the boundaries, whereas the bulk modes are
pumped to the boundary, leading to the typical non-Hermitian skin modes. Using
generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) scheme, we show that the
non-Hermiticity-induced skin modes can be distinguished from the topological
boundary modes. Upon increasing $\gamma$, the topological boundary mode
localized at one edge is pumped to the other edge, leading to an unconventional
state pumping. This is in contrast to the standard topological pumping where
adiabatic evolution of the parameters of the RM model leads to the pumping. We
further show that the usual topological pumping due to the adiabatic and
periodic variation of the model parameters survives even with finite $\gamma$.
However, it depends upon the driving protocols and strength of the
non-Hermiticity. With increasing $\gamma$, the adiabatic pumping is destroyed
first and then re-emerges as an unconventional pumping which does not have any
Hermitian counterpart.

(3D) computer-generated (CG) object floating over physical surfaces of
arbitrary shapes around us using projected imagery. However, the current
stereoscopic PM technology only satisfies binocular cues and is not capable of
providing correct focus cues, which causes a vergence--accommodation conflict
(VAC). Therefore, we propose a multifocal approach to mitigate VAC in
stereoscopic PM. Our primary technical contribution is to attach electrically
focus-tunable lenses (ETLs) to active shutter glasses to control both vergence
and accommodation. Specifically, we apply fast and periodical focal sweeps to
the ETLs, which causes the ""virtual image'"" (as an optical term) of a scene
observed through the ETLs to move back and forth during each sweep period. A 3D
CG object is projected from a synchronized high-speed projector only when the
virtual image of the projected imagery is located at a desired distance. This
provides an observer with the correct focus cues required. In this study, we
solve three technical issues that are unique to stereoscopic PM: (1) The 3D CG
object is displayed on non-planar and even moving surfaces; (2) the physical
surfaces need to be shown without the focus modulation; (3) the shutter glasses
additionally need to be synchronized with the ETLs and the projector. We also
develop a novel compensation technique to deal with the ""lens breathing""
artifact that varies the retinal size of the virtual image through focal length
modulation. Further, using a proof-of-concept prototype, we demonstrate that
our technique can present the virtual image of a target 3D CG object at the
correct depth. Finally, we validate the advantage provided by our technique by

method to estimate three-dimensional (3D) permeability fields from electrical
potential difference measurements. Traditional inversion and data assimilation
methods are used to ingest this ERT data into hydrogeophysical models to
estimate permeability. Due to ill-posedness and the curse of dimensionality,
existing inversion strategies provide poor estimates and low resolution of the
3D permeability field. Recent advances in deep learning provide us with
powerful algorithms to overcome this challenge. This paper presents a deep
learning (DL) framework to estimate the 3D subsurface permeability from
time-lapse ERT data. To test the feasibility of the proposed framework, we
train DL-enabled inverse models on simulation data. Subsurface process models
based on hydrogeophysics are used to generate this synthetic data for deep
learning analyses. Results show that proposed weak supervised learning can
capture salient spatial features in the 3D permeability field. Quantitatively,
the average mean squared error (in terms of the natural log) on the strongly
labeled training, validation, and test datasets is less than 0.5. The R2-score
(global metric) is greater than 0.75, and the percent error in each cell (local
metric) is less than 10%. Finally, an added benefit in terms of computational
cost is that the proposed DL-based inverse model is at least O(104) times
faster than running a forward model. Note that traditional inversion may
require multiple forward model simulations (e.g., in the order of 10 to 1000),
which are very expensive. This computational savings (O(105) - O(107)) makes
the proposed DL-based inverse model attractive for subsurface imaging and
real-time ERT monitoring applications due to fast and yet reasonably accurate
estimations of the permeability field.

studies are based on models. Yet in realistic situations the models are often
unknown and what available are only measured time series. Meanwhile, many
real-world systems are dynamically stable, in the sense that the systems return
to their equilibria in a short time after perturbations. This increases further
the difficulty of dynamics analysis, as many information of the system dynamics
are lost once the system is settled onto the equilibrium states. The question
we ask is: given the transient time series of a complex dynamical system
measured in the stable regime, can we infer from the data some properties of
the system dynamics and make predictions, e.g., predicting the critical point
where the equilibrium state becomes unstable? We show that for the typical
transitions in system of coupled oscillators, including quorum sensing,
amplitude death and complete synchronization, this question can be addressed by
the technique of reservoir computing in machine learning. More specifically, by
the transient series acquired at several states in the stable regime, we
demonstrate that the trained machine is able to predict accurately not only the
transient behaviors of the system in the stable regime, but also the critical
point where the stable state becomes unstable. Considering the ubiquitous
existence of transient activities in natural and man-made systems, the findings
may have broad applications.

in job centers. Emily, Beatrice, and Chiara from the high school Liceo
Artistico Statale Amedeo Modigliani in Padova accepted our invitation and
started a 6-month stage at the Padova University in close contact with us. The
challenge was to interbreed our scientific description of a relativistic jet of
a powerful galaxy and their artistic assimilation and subsequent representation
of it. During this period, they elaborated outstanding and innovative graphical
material used for the webpage as well as the conference poster. The quality of
the graphics was indeed excellent: one of their drawings became the cover of
the February 2020 issue of the prestigious Nature Astronomy journal.

$\Gamma_\mathbf{p}=1/\tau_\mathbf{p}$ observed by Angle Resolved Photoemission
Spectroscopy (ARPES) is evaluated using $s$-$d$ Kondo-Zener exchange
Hamiltonian used previously to describe superconducting properties of
high-$T_c$ cuprates; for correlation between critical temperature $T_c$ and BCS
coupling constant, for example. The performed qualitative analysis reveals that
""cold spots"" correspond to nodal regions of the superconducting phase where the
superconducting gap is zero, because the exchange interaction is annulled. Vice
versa, ""hot spots"" and intensive scattering in the normal state correspond to
the regions with maximal gap in the superconducting phase. We have obtained
that separable kernel postulated in the Fermi liquid approach to the normal
phase is the same kernel which is exactly calculated in the framework of the
$s$-$d$ approach in the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbital (LCAO)
approximation for CuO$_2$ plane. In this sense, at least on the qualitative
level, the superconducting cuprates are described by one and the same
Hamiltonian applied to their superconducting and normal properties. For the
overdopedcuprates having conventional Fermi liquid behavior we derived the
corresponding Stoss-integral for the $s$-$d$ interaction in the framework of
LCAO approximation which is the central result of the present study. Repeating
the thermodynamics we observed that for optimally doped cuprates
$2\Delta_\mathrm{max}/T_c$ is in good agreement with Pokrovsky theory for
anisotropic gap superconductors.

  Recognition","5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ICASSP2022",,,,"cs.MM cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human activity recognition (HAR) based on multi-modal approach has been
recently shown to improve the accuracy performance of HAR. However, restricted
computational resources associated with wearable devices, i.e., smartwatch,
failed to directly support such advanced methods. To tackle this issue, this
study introduces an end-to-end Vision-to-Sensor Knowledge Distillation (VSKD)
framework. In this VSKD framework, only time-series data, i.e., accelerometer
data, is needed from wearable devices during the testing phase. Therefore, this
framework will not only reduce the computational demands on edge devices, but
also produce a learning model that closely matches the performance of the
computational expensive multi-modal approach. In order to retain the local
temporal relationship and facilitate visual deep learning models, we first
convert time-series data to two-dimensional images by applying the Gramian
Angular Field ( GAF) based encoding method. We adopted ResNet18 and multi-scale
TRN with BN-Inception as teacher and student network in this study,
respectively. A novel loss function, named Distance and Angle-wised Semantic
Knowledge loss (DASK), is proposed to mitigate the modality variations between
the vision and the sensor domain. Extensive experimental results on UTD-MHAD,
MMAct, and Berkeley-MHAD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
competitiveness of the proposed VSKD model which can deployed on wearable
sensors.

exponential growth of the number of published scientific papers, but new ideas
has only a linear growth with time. The 19th and the first half of the 20th
century saw major scientific discoveries. But from the second half of the 20th
century, the number of publications far exceeds the number of impactful
discoveries. Does an exponentially growing number of publications indicate an
element of pathological research? Pressure to publish a large number of papers
has led to the phenomena of overproduction, unnecessary fragmentations,
overselling, predatory journals (pay and publish), clever plagiarism, and
deliberate obfuscation of scientific results so as to sell and oversell. This
is harming the healthy scientific culture of passion driven research. It is an
urgent problem which needs attention of the whole of the scientific community.
Some ways to mitigate these grave problems are discussed.
