metal-to-insulator transition of Anderson type was proposed in the past. In
this picture, a low-$T$ thermal state is akin to a metal with deeply infrared
(IR) Dirac modes abundant and extended, while a high-$T$ state is akin to an
insulator with IR modes depleted and localized below a mobility edge
$\lambda_{\text A} > 0$. Here we argue that, while $\lambda_{\text A}$ exists
in QCD, a high-$T$ state is not an insulator in such an analogy. Rather, it is
a critical state arising due to a new singular mobility edge at $\lambda_{\text
IR}=0$. This new mobility edge appears upon the transition into the recently
proposed IR phase. As a key part of such a metal-to-critical scenario, we
present evidence using pure-glue QCD that deeply infrared Dirac modes in the IR
phase extend to arbitrarily long distances. This is consistent with our
previous suggestion that the IR phase supports scale invariance in the
infrared. We discuss the role of Anderson-like aspects in this thermal regime
and emphasize that the combination of gauge field topology and disorder plays a
key role in shaping its IR physics. Our conclusions are conveyed by the
structure of Dirac spectral non-analyticities.

financial markets, war, business competition, and many other settings. We first
introduce the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning in two player zero
sum simultaneous action games and discuss the unique challenges this type of
game poses. Then we introduce two novel agents that attempt to handle these
challenges by using joint action Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The first agent, called
the Best Response AgenT (BRAT), builds an explicit model of its opponent's
policy using imitation learning, and then uses this model to find the best
response to exploit the opponent's strategy. The second agent, Meta-Nash DQN,
builds an implicit model of its opponent's policy in order to produce a context
variable that is used as part of the Q-value calculation. An explicit minimax
over Q-values is used to find actions close to Nash equilibrium. We find
empirically that both agents converge to Nash equilibrium in a self-play
setting for simple matrix games, while also performing well in games with
larger state and action spaces. These novel algorithms are evaluated against
vanilla RL algorithms as well as recent state of the art multi-agent and two
agent algorithms. This work combines ideas from traditional reinforcement

given contour condition, like a low-resolution image or sketch. However, the
problem of identity ambiguity remains unsolved, which usually occurs when the
contour is too vague to provide reliable identity information (e.g., when its
resolution is extremely low). Thus feasible solutions of image restoration
could be infinite. In this work, we propose a novel framework that takes the
contour and an extra image specifying the identity as the inputs, where the
contour can be of various modalities, including the low-resolution image,
sketch, and semantic label map. Concretely, we propose a novel dual-encoder
architecture, in which an identity encoder extracts the identity-related
feature, accompanied by a main encoder to obtain the rough contour information
and further fuse all the information together. The encoder output is
iteratively fed into a pre-trained StyleGAN generator until getting a
satisfying result. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
achieves identity-guided face generation conditioned on multi-modal contour
images. Moreover, our method can produce photo-realistic results with
1024$\times$1024 resolution.

we establish guarantees for the generic problems by leveraging techniques from

Automation of surgical tasks promises to reduce the mental exertion and fatigue

to be robust to the distribution shift introduced by pairing a learned policy
with a human team member. Multi-agent policies are trained directly from images
in simulation to control multiple instruments in a sub task of the minimally
invasive removal of the gallbladder. These agents are evaluated individually
and in cooperation with humans to demonstrate their suitability as autonomous
assistants. Compared to human teams, the hybrid teams with artificial agents
perform better considering completion time (44.4% to 71.2% shorter) as well as
number of collisions (44.7% to 98.0% fewer). Path lengths, however, increase
under control of an artificial agent (11.4% to 33.5% longer). A multi-agent
formulation of the learning problem was favored over a single-agent formulation
on this surgical sub task, due to the sequential learning of the two
instruments. This approach may be extended to other tasks that are difficult to

towards seamless cooperation between surgeons and assistive technologies.

  More recently it was shown that DWI is able to reconstruct pore shapes using
a specialized magnetic field gradient scheme so that cell size distributions
may be obtained. So far, artificial systems have been used for experimental
demonstration without extraporal signal components and relatively low gradient
amplitudes.
  Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of
diffusion pore imaging in the presence of extraporal fluids and to develop
correction methods for effects arising from extraporal signal contributions.
Monte Carlo simulations and validation experiments on a 14.1 T spectrometer
with a dedicated diffusion probe head were performed.
  Both by using a filter gradient approach suppressing extraporal signal
components as well as using postprocessing methods relying on the Gaussian
phase approximation, it was possible to reconstruct pore space functions in the
presence of extraporal fluids with little to no deviations from the
expectations. These results may be a significant step towards application of
diffusion pore imaging to biological samples. While still ultra-high gradients
are required, this problem may be mitigated by recent developments in the field
of local gradient coils for human applications.

quantum information theory, here we build an axiomatization for quantum realism

listing some physically-motivated principles able to characterize quantum
realism in a ``metric'' independent manner. We introduce some criteria defining
monotones and measures of realism and then search for potential candidates
within some celebrated information theories -- those induced by the von

diagnosing many diseases, notably cancer. Highly multiplexed tissue imaging
builds on this foundation, enabling the collection of up to 60 channels of

This provides unique insight into disease biology and promises to help with the
design of patient-specific therapies. However, a substantial gap remains with
respect to visualizing the resulting multivariate image data and effectively
supporting pathology workflows in digital environments on screen. We,
therefore, developed Scope2Screen, a scalable software system for focus+context
exploration and annotation of whole-slide, high-plex, tissue images. Our
approach scales to analyzing 100GB images of 10^9 or more pixels per channel,
containing millions of cells. A multidisciplinary team of visualization
experts, microscopists, and pathologists identified key image exploration and
annotation tasks involving finding, magnifying, quantifying, and organizing
ROIs in an intuitive and cohesive manner. Building on a scope2screen metaphor,
we present interactive lensing techniques that operate at single-cell and
tissue levels. Lenses are equipped with task-specific functionality and
descriptive statistics, making it possible to analyze image features, cell
types, and spatial arrangements (neighborhoods) across image channels and
scales. A fast sliding-window search guides users to regions similar to those
under the lens; these regions can be analyzed and considered either separately
or as part of a larger image collection. A novel snapshot method enables linked
lens configurations and image statistics to be saved, restored, and shared. We
validate our designs with domain experts and apply Scope2Screen in two case
studies involving lung and colorectal cancers to discover cancer-relevant image
features.

clustering and its cross correlation with weak lensing fields. Unlike the past
spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS), currently ongoing spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as Prime Focus
Spectrograph (PFS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) suffer from
the fiber assignment artifacts more severely because there are more target
galaxies than available fibers. The previous studies found that the fiber
assignment suppresses the amplitude of the galaxy power spectrum at all scales.
We newly find that the fiber assignment introduces the artificial correlation
of structure at different redshifts, which suppresses the amplitude of the
galaxy-lensing cross power spectrum. We show that the fiber assignment effects
on the cross power spectrum can be mitigated at all scales with accuracy better
than $\sim 1\%$, by up-weighting observed galaxies with the probability to be
observed. This is not the case for the galaxy power spectrum, which is not
fully corrected at $k \gtrsim 0.2$ [$h$/Mpc]. We find that the galaxy-lensing
cross power spectrum is not affected by the pairwise probability of galaxies to
be observed, and thus the correction method based on the individual probability
is sufficient at all scales.

momentum density correlation observables and outline the different physics
mechanisms often ascribed to each. This set of observables also contains a new
multiplicity-momentum correlation. Our mathematical relation can be used as a

possible radiation in undesired locations. When large arrays at high
frequencies, such as DMA, are employed, WPT might take place in the radiating
near-field (Fresnel) region where spherical wave propagation holds, rather than
plane wave propagation as in the far-field. In this paper, we study WPT systems
charging multiple devices in the Fresnel region, where the energy transmitter
is equipped with an emerging DMA, exploring how the antenna configuration can
exploit the spherical wavefront to generate focused energy beams. In
particular, after presenting a mathematical model for DMA-based radiating
near-field WPT systems, we characterize the weighted sum-harvested energy

noise to an input which can fool a detector. Recently, successful real-world
printable adversarial patches were proven efficient against state-of-the-art
neural networks. In the transition from digital noise based attacks to
real-world physical attacks, the myriad of factors affecting object detection
will also affect adversarial patches. Among these factors, view angle is one of
the most influential, yet under-explored. In this paper, we study the effect of
view angle on the effectiveness of an adversarial patch. To this aim, we
propose the first approach that considers a multi-view context by combining
existing adversarial patches with a perspective geometric transformation in
order to simulate the effect of view angle changes. Our approach has been
evaluated on two datasets: the first dataset which contains most real world
constraints of a multi-view context, and the second dataset which empirically
isolates the effect of view angle. The experiments show that view angle
significantly affects the performance of adversarial patches, where in some
cases the patch loses most of its effectiveness. We believe that these results
motivate taking into account the effect of view angles in future adversarial
attacks, and open up new opportunities for adversarial defenses.

whether it is a local subthreshold phenomenon, synaptic input to neurons or it
is a flow of electrical signals merged as volume conduction which are generated
from simultaneous firing neurons in the cerebral cortex and obeys the Maxwell
equations. In this study, we recorded in a monkey brain simultaneously LFP's

in sites in all BG nuclei: the striatum, globus pallidus, and subthalamic

significant cross-correlations (potential links) while removing ""spurious""

given by the energy-momentum tensor of the wave equation using the timelike
vector field of the Regge-Wheeler variable, which asymptotically becomes normal
to the horizons. The behaviour of solutions at low spatial-frequencies and
their behaviour at high angular momenta are the only obstructions causing this
breakdown of scattering. The breakdown follows from an analysis of a
$1+1$-dimensional wave equation with exponentially decaying potential which we
treat for general potentials, and we show that the breakdown is generic.

questions remain on the impact of Zn and Ca. In this context, the precipitation
in Mg-1.5Zn-0.25Ca (ZX20, in wt.%) was investigated upon linear heating from
about room temperature to 400 C, with a particular focus on the debated ternary
precipitate phase. Three exothermic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
peaks were observed at 125, 250 and 320 C. The microstructure at the end of
these peaks (205, 260 and 350 C) was probed in a multiscale correlative
approach using atom probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). At 205 C, APT analysis revealed Ca-rich, Zn-rich and Zn-Ca-rich clusters
of about 3 nm in size and with a number density of 5.7 x 10^23 m^-3. At 260 C,
APT and TEM showed mono-layered Zn-Ca-rich Guinier-Preston (GP) zones of about
8 nm in size and with a number density of 1.3 x 10^23 m^-3. At 350 C, there are
larger, highly coherent elongated precipitates of about 50 nm in size, in a
lower number density, and of two types: either binary Mg2Ca precipitates or
less numerous ternary Ca2Mg6Zn3 precipitates, as deduced from scanning
TEM-based energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) and nanodiffraction in
TEM. The highest hardening, probed by Vickers testing, relates to the end of
the 125 C DSC peak and thus to GP zones, which outperform the hardening induced
by the nanoscale clusters and the larger intermetallic particles. Precipitation
in ZX20 upon linear heating was compared to the one induced by hot extrusion at
330 C. Here, ternary precipitates outnumber the binary ones and are larger,
incoherent, and in a much lower number density. They are unequivocally made of
hexagonal Ca2Mg5Zn5, as deduced by atomically resolved EDS mapping and scanning
TEM imaging, and supported by simulations. Precipitation complexity of in lean
Mg-Zn-Ca alloys and its kinetic path are discussed.

govern to a great extent their mechanical performance. To assess the influence
of local structural variability on the local strain and mechanical response of
the network, we propose a multiscale approach combining modeling, numerical
simulation and experimental measurements. Based on micro-mechanical fiber
network simulations, a continuum model describing the response at the mesoscale
level is first developed. Experimentally measured spatial fields of thickness,
density, fiber orientation and anisotropy are thereafter used as input to a
macroscale finite-element model. The latter is used to simulate the impact of
spatial variability of each of the studied structural properties. In addition,
this work brings novelty by including the influence of the drying condition
during the production process on the fiber properties. The proposed approach is
experimentally validated by comparison to measured strain fields and uniaxial
responses. The results suggest that the spatial variability in density presents
the highest impact on the local strain field followed by thickness and fiber
orientation. Meanwhile, for the mechanical response, the fiber orientation
angle with respect to the drying restraints is the key influencer and its
contribution to the anisotropy of the mechanical properties is greater than the
contribution of the fiber anisotropy developed during the fiber sheet-making.

sufficient accuracy depending on the degree of nonlinearity of the limit-state

design for vehicle crashworthiness problem solved in this paper, where all RBDO
methods based on FORM strongly violates the probabilistic constraints. The
Response Surface Single Loop (RSSL) method for RBDO is proposed based on the
higher order probability computation for quadratic models previously presented
by the authors. The RSSL-method bypasses the concept of an MPP and has high
accuracy and efficiency. The method can solve problems with both constant and
varying standard deviation of design variables and is particularly well suited
for typical industrial applications where general quadratic response surface
models can be used. If the quadratic response surface models of the
deterministic constraints are valid in the whole region of interest, the method
becomes a true single loop method with accuracy higher than traditional SORM.
In other cases, quadratic response surface models are fitted to the

heterogeneity within brain disorders like Alzheimer Disease (AD) by quantifying
how each patient deviates from the expected normative pattern that has been
learned from a healthy control distribution. Since AD is a multifactorial
disease with more than one biological pathways, multimodal magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) neuroimaging data can provide complementary information about the
disease heterogeneity. However, existing deep learning based normative models
on multimodal MRI data use unimodal autoencoders with a single encoder and
decoder that may fail to capture the relationship between brain measurements
extracted from different MRI modalities. In this work, we propose multi-modal
variational autoencoder (mmVAE) based normative modelling framework that can
capture the joint distribution between different modalities to identify
abnormal brain structural patterns in AD. Our multi-modal framework takes as
input Freesurfer processed brain region volumes from T1-weighted (cortical and
subcortical) and T2-weighed (hippocampal) scans of cognitively normal
participants to learn the morphological characteristics of the healthy brain.
The estimated normative model is then applied on Alzheimer Disease (AD)
patients to quantify the deviation in brain volumes and identify the abnormal
brain structural patterns due to the effect of the different AD stages. Our
experimental results show that modeling joint distribution between the multiple
MRI modalities generates deviation maps that are more sensitive to disease
staging within AD, have a better correlation with patient cognition and result
in higher number of brain regions with statistically significant deviations
compared to a unimodal baseline model with all modalities concatenated as a
single input.

Our model works for both RGB and RGBD data, and dynamically estimating depth if
not available. Taking the inner workings of depth-prediction networks into

essentially mimicking the multi-modality input. 2) Our MGSnet for RGB SOD

distinctly from the metallic Weyl counterparts, a molecular zero mode
atomically frustrated at the spectral densities of the dimer's atoms. To this
end, a strong metallic phase with a plateau in the density of states
established by the broken inversion symmetry, together with pronounced blue and

statistical structure that is not Maxwell-Boltzmann but Bose-Einstein. Our
explanation is that this is due to the presence of 'indistinguishability' in
human language as a result of the same words in different parts of the story
being indistinguishable from one another. In the current article, we set out to
provide an explanation for this Bose-Einstein statistics. We show that it is
the presence of 'meaning' in 'stories' that gives rise to the lack of
independence characteristic of Bose-Einstein, and provides conclusive evidence
that 'words can be considered the quanta of human language', structurally
similar to how 'photons are the quanta of light'. Using several studies on
entanglement from our Brussels research group, we also show that it is also the
presence of 'meaning' in texts that makes the von Neumann entropy of a total
text smaller relative to the entropy of the words composing it. We explain how
the new insights in this article fit in with the research domain called
'quantum cognition', where quantum probability models and quantum vector spaces
are used in human cognition, and are also relevant to the use of quantum
structures in information retrieval and natural language processing, and how
they introduce 'quantization' and 'Bose-Einstein statistics' as relevant
quantum effects there. Inspired by the conceptuality interpretation of quantum
mechanics, and relying on the new insights, we put forward hypotheses about the
nature of physical reality. In doing so, we note how this new type of decrease
in entropy, and its explanation, may be important for the development of
quantum thermodynamics. We likewise note how it can also give rise to an
original explanatory picture of the nature of physical reality on the surface
of planet Earth, in which human culture emerges as a reinforcing continuation
of life.

shock-containing jets. With a modelled ideally expanded mean flow as input, an
approximation of the shock-cell structure is obtained from the parabolised
stability equations (PSE) at zero frequency. This solution is then used to
define a new shock-containing mean flow, which is a function of the shock-cell
wavenumber at each streamwise station. Linearisation of the Navier-Stokes
equations around this quasi-periodic mean flow allows us to postulate a
solution based on the Floquet ansatz, and further manipulation of the equations
leads to a system called the parabolised Floquet equations (PFE) that bears
several similarities to PSE. The modulation wavenumbers are marched spatially
together with the central Kelvin-Helmholtz wavenumber, leading to a modulated
wavepacket as the final solution. The limitations of PFE are highlighted, and
the method is applied to two sample cases: a canonical slowly diverging jet at
low supersonic Mach number and an overexpanded jet, for which large-eddy
simulation (LES) data is available. Overall, good agreement is observed between
the wavepackets predicted by PFE and the leading spectral proper orthogonal
decomposition (SPOD) modes from the LES, suggesting that the method is able to
capture the underlying physical mechanism associated with wavepacket
modulation: the extraction of energy from the mean flow by the Kelvin-Helmholtz
mode and a redistribution of energy to modulation wavenumbers due to the
interaction with the shock-cell structure.

large number of data on the fly, and the embedded systems are usually unable to
perform back-propagation which is essential for training. Most existing
few-shot detection methods are confronted here as they need extra training. We
propose a novel morphable detector (MD), that simply ""morphs"" some of its
changeable parameters online estimated from the few samples, so as to detect
novel classes without any extra training. The MD has two sets of parameters,
one for the feature embedding and the other for class representation (called
""prototypes""). Each class is associated with a hidden prototype to be learned
by integrating the visual and semantic embeddings. The learning of the MD is
based on the alternate learning of the feature embedding and the prototypes in
an EM-like approach which allows the recovery of an unknown prototype from a
few samples of a novel class. Once an MD is learned, it is able to use a few
samples of a novel class to directly compute its prototype to fulfill the
online morphing process. We have shown the superiority of the MD in Pascal,

problems with a finite-sum structure. Though this method is widely utilized in
practice such as the training of neural networks, its convergence behavior is
only understood in several limited settings. In this paper, under the
well-known Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality, we establish strong limit-point
convergence results for RR with appropriate diminishing step sizes, namely, the
whole sequence of iterates generated by RR is convergent and converges to a
single stationary point in an almost sure sense. In addition, we derive the
corresponding rate of convergence, depending on the KL exponent and the
suitably selected diminishing step sizes. When the KL exponent lies in
$[0,\frac12]$, the convergence is at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$ with $t$
counting the iteration number. When the KL exponent belongs to $(\frac12,1)$,
our derived convergence rate is of the form $\mathcal{O}(t^{-q})$ with $q\in
(0,1)$ depending on the KL exponent. The standard KL inequality-based
convergence analysis framework only applies to algorithms with a certain
descent property. We conduct a novel convergence analysis for the non-descent
RR method with diminishing step sizes based on the KL inequality, which
generalizes the standard KL framework. We summarize our main steps and core
ideas in an informal analysis framework, which is of independent interest. As a
direct application of this framework, we also establish similar strong
limit-point convergence results for the reshuffled proximal point method.

$s\ge0$. Such approximations retain much more 3-mode interactions, thus more
accurate, than the conventional exact resonance approach. Our approach is free
from any limiting argument that requires physical parameters to tend to zero or
infinity, and is free from any small divisor argument (so estimates depend
smoothly on the torus' aspect ratios). The key estimate hinges on counting of
integer solutions of Diophantine inequalities rather than Diophantine
equations. Using a range of novel ideas, we handle rigorously and optimally
challenges arising from the non-trivial irrational functions in these
inequalities. The main results and ingredients of the proofs can form part of

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents that exist in high-dimensional state
spaces, such as those composed of images, have interconnected learning burdens.
Agents must learn an action-selection policy that completes their given task,
which requires them to learn a representation of the state space that discerns
between useful and useless information. The reward function is the only
supervised feedback that RL agents receive, which causes a representation
learning bottleneck that can manifest in poor sample efficiency. We present
$k$-Step Latent (KSL), a new representation learning method that enforces
temporal consistency of representations via a self-supervised auxiliary task
wherein agents learn to recurrently predict action-conditioned representations
of the state space. The state encoder learned by KSL produces low-dimensional
representations that make optimization of the RL task more sample efficient.
Altogether, KSL produces state-of-the-art results in both data efficiency and
asymptotic performance in the popular PlaNet benchmark suite. Our analyses show
that KSL produces encoders that generalize better to new tasks unseen during
training, and its representations are more strongly tied to reward, are more
invariant to perturbations in the state space, and move more smoothly through
the temporal axis of the RL problem than other methods such as DrQ, RAD, CURL,
and SAC-AE.

mortality prediction) and multi-label classification (e.g. phenotyping) in a
unified framework. Our supervised contrastive loss practices the key idea of
contrastive learning, namely, pulling similar samples closer and pushing
dissimilar ones apart from each other, simultaneously by its two components:
$\mathcal{L}_{\text{Contrastive Cross Entropy} }$ tries to contrast samples
with learned anchors which represent positive and negative clusters, and
$\mathcal{L}_{\text{Supervised Contrastive Regularizer}}$ tries to contrast
samples with each other according to their supervised labels. We propose two
versions of the above supervised contrastive loss and our experiments on
real-world EHR data demonstrate that our proposed loss functions show benefits
in improving the performance of strong baselines and even state-of-the-art
models on benchmarking tasks for clinical risk predictions. Our loss functions
work well with extremely imbalanced data which are common for clinical risk
prediction problems. Our loss functions can be easily used to replace (binary

first comprehensive evaluation of deep transfer learning (DTL) for identifying
common weeds specific to cotton production systems in southern United States. A
new dataset for weed identification was created, consisting of 5187 color
images of 15 weed classes collected under natural lighting conditions and at
varied weed growth stages, in cotton fields during the 2020 and 2021 field
seasons. We evaluated 27 state-of-the-art deep learning models through transfer
learning and established an extensive benchmark for the considered weed
identification task. DTL achieved high classification accuracy of F1 scores
exceeding 95%, requiring reasonably short training time (less than 2.5 hours)
across models. ResNet101 achieved the best F1-score of 99.1% whereas 14 out of
the 27 models achieved F1 scores exceeding 98.0%. However, the performance on
minority weed classes with few training samples was less satisfactory for
models trained with a conventional, unweighted cross entropy loss function. To
address this issue, a weighted cross entropy loss function was adopted, which
achieved substantially improved accuracies for minority weed classes.
Furthermore, a deep learning-based cosine similarity metrics was employed to
analyze the similarity among weed classes, assisting in the interpretation of

observables to construct a lifted linear state space model that describes the
rigid body dynamics based on the dual quaternion representation. In general,
the Koopman operator is a linear infinite dimensional operator, which means
that the derived linear state space model of the rigid body dynamics will be
infinite-dimensional, which is not suitable for modeling and control design
purposes. Recently, finite approximations of the operator computed by means of
methods like the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) have shown
promising results for different classes of problems. However, without using an
appropriate set of observables in the EDMD approach, there can be no guarantees
that the computed approximation of the nonlinear dynamics is sufficiently
accurate. The major challenge in using the Koopman operator for constructing a
linear state space model is the choice of observables. State-of-the-art methods
in the field compute the approximations of the observables by using neural
networks, standard radial basis functions (RBFs), polynomials or heuristic
approximations of these functions. However, these observables might not
providea sufficiently accurate approximation or representation of the dynamics.
In contrast, we first show the pointwise convergence of the derived observable
functions to zero, thereby allowing us to choose a finite set of these
observables. Next, we use the derived observables in EDMD to compute the lifted
linear state and input matrices for the rigid body dynamics. Finally, we show
that an LQR type (linear) controller, which is designed based on the truncated
linear state space model, can steer the rigid body to a desired state while its
performance is commensurate with that of a nonlinear controller. The efficacy
of our approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations.

to handle modern learning tasks. However, most existing strategies are
theoretically designed based on restrictive assumptions (e.g., convexity of the
lower-level sub-problem), and computationally not applicable for
high-dimensional tasks. Moreover, there are almost no gradient-based methods
able to solve BLO in those challenging scenarios, such as BLO with functional
constraints and pessimistic BLO. In this work, by reformulating BLO into
approximated single-level problems, we provide a new algorithm, named Bi-level
Value-Function-based Sequential Minimization (BVFSM), to address the above
issues. Specifically, BVFSM constructs a series of value-function-based
approximations, and thus avoids repeated calculations of recurrent gradient and
Hessian inverse required by existing approaches, time-consuming especially for
high-dimensional tasks. We also extend BVFSM to address BLO with additional
functional constraints. More importantly, BVFSM can be used for the challenging
pessimistic BLO, which has never been properly solved before. In theory, we
prove the asymptotic convergence of BVFSM on these types of BLO, in which the
restrictive lower-level convexity assumption is discarded. To our best
knowledge, this is the first gradient-based algorithm that can solve different
kinds of BLO (e.g., optimistic, pessimistic, and with constraints) with solid
convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments verify the theoretical
investigations and demonstrate our superiority on various real-world

either insufficient to cope with the heterogeneous nature of uncertainty or
inadequate to perform well with unknown mathematical models. In this paper, we
propose using multi-layer convolutional neural networks for empirical
uncertainty estimation and feature extraction of nuclear pulse signals. This
method is based on deep learning, a recent development of machine learning
techniques, which learns the desired mapping function from training data and
generalizes to unseen test data. Furthermore, ensemble learning is utilized to
estimate the uncertainty originating from trainable parameters of the network
and to improve the robustness of the whole model. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed method, simulation studies, in comparison with curve fitting,
investigate extensive conditions and show its universal applicability. Finally,
a case study is made using data from a NICA-MPD electromagnetic calorimeter
module exposed to a test beam at DESY, Germany. The uncertainty estimation
method successfully detected out-of-distribution samples and also achieved good

which can achieve high recognition accuracy equivalent to the existing

large-scale quantum network (QN) of partially entangled bipartite pure states

for restricted QN topologies. This paper explores and amplifies a new and more
effective mapping of a QN, referred to as concurrence percolation theory
(ConPT), that suggests using deterministic rather than probabilistic protocols
for scalably improving on CEP across arbitrary QN topologies. More precisely,
we implement ConPT via a deterministic entanglement transmission (DET) scheme
that is fully analogous to resistor network analysis, with the corresponding
series and parallel rules represented by deterministic entanglement swapping
and concentration protocols, respectively. The main contribution of this paper
is to establish a powerful mathematical framework, which is applicable to
arbitrary d-dimensional information carriers (qudits), that provides different
natural optimality metrics in terms of generalized k-concurrences (a family of
fundamental entanglement measures) for different QN topology. In particular, we
conclude that the introduced DET scheme (a) is optimal over the well-known
nested repeater protocol for distilling entanglement from partially entangled
qubits and (b) leads to higher success probabilities of obtaining a maximally
entangled state than using CEP. The implementation of the DET scheme is
experimentally feasible as tested on IBM's quantum computation platform.

privacy mechanism based on the difference of two independent Poisson random
variables. To quantify its privacy guarantees, we analyze the privacy loss
distribution via a numerical evaluation and provide a sharp bound on the
R\'enyi divergence between two shifted Skellam distributions. While useful in
both centralized and distributed privacy applications, we investigate how it
can be applied in the context of federated learning with secure aggregation
under communication constraints. Our theoretical findings and extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the Skellam mechanism provides the
same privacy-accuracy trade-offs as the continuous Gaussian mechanism, even
when the precision is low. More importantly, Skellam is closed under summation
and sampling from it only requires sampling from a Poisson distribution -- an
efficient routine that ships with all machine learning and data analysis
software packages. These features, along with its discrete nature and
competitive privacy-accuracy trade-offs, make it an attractive practical
alternative to the newly introduced discrete Gaussian mechanism.

newcomer on the scene, regularizes the loss layer by flipping a small share of
the target labels at random and training the neural network on this distorted
data so as to not learn the training data. It is observed that high confidence
labels during training cause the overfitting problem and DL selects disturb
labels at random regardless of the confidence of labels. To solve this
shortcoming of DL, we propose Directional DisturbLabel (DDL) a novel
regularization technique that makes use of the class probabilities to infer the
confident labels and using these labels to regularize the model. This active
regularization makes use of the model behavior during training to regularize it
in a more directed manner. To address regression problems, we also propose
DisturbValue (DV), and DisturbError (DE). DE uses only predefined confident
labels to disturb target values. DV injects noise into a portion of target
values at random similar to DL. In this paper, 6 and 8 datasets are used to
validate the robustness of our methods in classification and regression tasks

approaches to quantum gravity. Here we report the analysis of the Casimir
effect for parallel plates separated by a distance of $L$ using a Lorentz
invariant scalar theory in a non-commutative space-time (DFR space-time), both
at zero and finite temperatures. This is done in two ways; one when the
additional space-dimensions introduced in DFR space-time are treated as extra
dimensions but on par with usual space-dimension and in the second way, the
additional dimensions are treated as compact dimensions. Casimir force obtained
in the first approach coincides with the result in the extra-dimensional
commutative space-time and this is varying as $\frac{1}{L^5}$. In the second
approach, we derive the corrections to the Casimir force, which is dependent on
the separation between the plate, $L$ and on the size of the extra compactified
dimension, $R$. Since correction terms are very small, keeping only the most
significant terms of these corrections, we show that for certain values of the
R, the corrections due to non-commutativity makes the force between the
parallel plates more attractive, and using this, we find lower bound on the
value of $R$. We show here that the requirement of the Casimir force and the
energy to be real, impose the condition that the weight function used in
defining the DFR action has to be a constant. At zero temperature, we find
correction terms due to non-commutativity, depend on $L$ and $R$ dependent
modified Bessel functions $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$, with coefficients that vary as
$\frac{1}{LR^3}$ and $\frac{1}{L^2R^2}$, respectively . For finite temperature,
the Casimir force has correction terms that scale as $\frac{1}{L}$ and
$\frac{1}{L^3}$ in high-temperature limit and as $\frac{1}{L^2}$ and
$\frac{1}{L^4}$ in the low-temperature limit.

(PoK) based signatures have become an important type of possible post-quantum
signatures. Regarding code-based cryptography, the original approach for PoK
based signatures is the Stern protocol which allows to prove the knowledge of a
small weight vector solving a given instance of the Syndrome Decoding (SD)
problem over F2. It features a soundness error equal to 2/3. This protocol was
improved a few years later by V\'eron who proposed a variation of the scheme
based on the General Syndrome Decoding (GSD) problem which leads to better
results in term of communication. A few years later, the AGS protocol
introduced a variation of the V\'eron protocol based on Quasi-Cyclic (QC)
matrices. The AGS protocol permits to obtain an asymptotic soundness error of
1/2 and an improvement in term of communications. In the present paper, we
introduce the Quasi-Cyclic Stern PoK which constitutes an adaptation of the AGS
scheme in a SD context, as well as several new optimizations for code-based
PoK. Our main optimization on the size of the signature can't be applied to GSD
based protocols such as AGS and therefore motivated the design of our new
protocol. In addition, we also provide a special soundness proof that is
compatible with the use of the Fiat-Shamir transform for 5-round protocols.
This approach is valid for our protocol but also for the AGS protocol which was
lacking such a proof. We compare our results with existing signatures including
the recent code-based signatures based on PoK leveraging the MPC in the head
paradigm. In practice, our new protocol is as fast as AGS while reducing its
associated signature length by 20%. As a consequence, it constitutes an
interesting trade-off between signature length and execution time for the
design of a code-based signature relying only on the difficulty of the SD
problem.

model robustness by leveraging adversarial examples for training. However, most
AT methods are in face of expensive time and computational cost for calculating
gradients at multiple steps in generating adversarial examples. To boost
training efficiency, fast gradient sign method (FGSM) is adopted in fast AT
methods by calculating gradient only once. Unfortunately, the robustness is far
from satisfactory. One reason may arise from the initialization fashion.
Existing fast AT generally uses a random sample-agnostic initialization, which
facilitates the efficiency yet hinders a further robustness improvement. Up to
now, the initialization in fast AT is still not extensively explored. In this
paper, we boost fast AT with a sample-dependent adversarial initialization,
i.e., an output from a generative network conditioned on a benign image and its
gradient information from the target network. As the generative network and the
target network are optimized jointly in the training phase, the former can
adaptively generate an effective initialization with respect to the latter,
which motivates gradually improved robustness. Experimental evaluations on four
benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
state-of-the-art fast AT methods, as well as comparable robustness to advanced

answers a large number of application-based questions towards the structural
evolution and the function of a real system. For example, the questions can be
related to how the real system evolves or how individuals interact with each
other in social networks. Although the evolution of the real system may seem to
be found regularly, capturing patterns on the whole process of the evolution is
not trivial. Link prediction is one of the most important technologies in
network information mining, which can help us understand the real system's
evolution law. Link prediction aims to uncover missing links or quantify the
likelihood of the emergence of nonexistent links from known network structures.
Currently, widely existing methods of link prediction almost focus on
short-path networks that usually have a myriad of close triangular structures.
However, these algorithms on highly sparse or long-path networks have poor
performance. Here, we propose a new index that is associated with the
principles of Structural Equivalence and Shortest Path Length ($SESPL$) to
estimate the likelihood of link existence in long-path networks. Through 548

other similarity-based predictors in long-path networks. We also exploit the
performance of $SESPL$ predictor and embedding-based approaches via machine
learning techniques, and the performance of $SESPL$ can achieve a gain of
44.09\% over $GraphWave$ and 7.93\% over $Node2vec$. Finally, according to the

balls-and-bins model. In this model, an overseer is provided with uniform
random allocation of $m$ balls into $n$ bins in an on-line fashion. For each
ball, the overseer could reject its allocation and place the ball into a new
bin drawn independently at random. The purpose of the overseer is to reduce the
maximum load of the bins, which is defined as the difference between the
maximum number of balls in a single bin and $m/n$, i.e., the average number of
balls among all bins.
  We provide tight estimates for three quantities: the lowest maximum load that
could be achieved at time $m$, the lowest maximum load that could be achieved
uniformly over the entire time interval $[m]:=\{1, 2, \cdots, m\}$, and the
lowest \emph{typical} maximum load that could be achieved over the interval
$[m]$, where the typicality means that the maximum load holds for $1-o(1)$

  We show that when $m$ and $n$ are sufficiently large, a typical maximum load
of $(\log n)^{1/2+o(1)}$ can be achieved with high probability, asymptotically
the same as the optimal maximum load that could be achieved at time $m$.
However, for any strategy, the maximal load among all times in the interval
$[m]$ is $\Omega\big(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\big)$ with high probability. A
strategy achieving this bound is provided.
  An explanation for this gap is provided by our optimal strategies as follows.
To control the typical load, we restrain the maximum load for some time, during
which we accumulate more and more bins with relatively high load. After a
while, we have to employ for a short time a different strategy to reduce the
number of relatively heavily loaded bins, at the expanse of temporarily
inducing high load in a few bins.

Hall (QSH) insulator, similar to the one proposed in the honeycomb lattice
under next-nearest neighbor repulsions. In the absence of repulsive
interactions, a topological insulator appears by the spin-orbit coupling and is
characterized by a nonzero spin Chern number. By considering up to next-nearest
neighbor repulsions at Hartree-Fock level, the intrinsic spin-orbit gap is
found to grow by orders of magnitude and a QSH insulating phase appears that
has both a finite spin Chern number and order parameter. Transport coefficients
and spin susceptibility are calculated and found to consistently account for
most of the experimental findings, including the metal-to-insulator crossover
occurring at $\sim50$ K as well as the Berry phase change from 0 to $\pi$ under
hydrostatic pressure. We argue that such a QSH insulating phase does not
necessitate a sizeable spin-orbit interaction to generate a large insulating
gap, which is highly advantageous for the search of novel topological phases in
generic materials having low symmetry lattice and/or small spin-orbit coupling.

original proposal suggests that fictitious time(or stochastic time) evolution
of stochastic 2-point correlation function will be identical to the radial
evolution of the double trace operator of certain classes of holographic
models, which are free theories in AdS space. We study holographic gravity
models with interactions in AdS space and establish a map between the
holographic renormalization flow of multi-trace operators and stochastic
$n$-point functions. To give precise examples, we extensively study conformally
coupled scalar theory in AdS$_6$. What we have found is that the stochastic
time $t$ dependent 3-point function obtained from Langevin equation with its
Euclidean action being given by $S_E=2I_{os}$ is identical to holographic
renormalization group evolution of holographic triple trace operator as its
energy scale $r$ changes once an identification of $t=r$ is made. $I_{os}$ is
the on-shell action of holographic model of conformally coupled scalar theory
at the AdS boundary. We argue that this can be fully extended to mathematical
relationship between multi point functions and multi trace operators in each

representations since it learns without labels. However, large-scale unlabeled
datasets in the wild often have long-tailed label distributions, where we know
little about the behavior of SSL. In this work, we systematically investigate
self-supervised learning under dataset imbalance. First, we find out via
extensive experiments that off-the-shelf self-supervised representations are
already more robust to class imbalance than supervised representations. The
performance gap between balanced and imbalanced pre-training with SSL is
significantly smaller than the gap with supervised learning, across sample
sizes, for both in-domain and, especially, out-of-domain evaluation. Second,
towards understanding the robustness of SSL, we hypothesize that SSL learns
richer features from frequent data: it may learn
label-irrelevant-but-transferable features that help classify the rare classes
and downstream tasks. In contrast, supervised learning has no incentive to
learn features irrelevant to the labels from frequent examples. We validate
this hypothesis with semi-synthetic experiments and theoretical analyses on a
simplified setting. Third, inspired by the theoretical insights, we devise a
re-weighted regularization technique that consistently improves the SSL
representation quality on imbalanced datasets with several evaluation criteria,
closing the small gap between balanced and imbalanced datasets with the same

experimentally tested in a Kundt Tube to verify the dependence of absorption
characteristics on cell thickness and lateral size. The resonance frequency is
found to scale linearly with respect to both thickness and lateral size in the
considered range, enabling tunability of the working frequency. Using these
data, a flat panel is designed and fabricated by arranging cells of different
dimensions in a quasi-periodic lattice, exploiting the acoustic ""rainbow""
effect, i.e. superimposing the frequency response of the different cells to
generate a wider absorption spectrum, covering the required frequency range
between 800 and 1200 Hz. The panel is thinner and more lightweight compared to
other sound absorption solutions, and designed in modular form so as to be
applicable to different geometries. The performance of the panel is
experimentally validated in a small-scale reverberation room, and close to
ideal absorption is demonstrated at the desired frequency of operation. Thus,
this work suggests a design procedure for noise-mitigation panel solutions and
provides experimental proof of the versatility and effectiveness of

HSC J1631+4426, whose oxygen abundance and stellar mass are known to be
12+log(O/H) $=6.9$ and $\log_{10}(M_*/{\rm M}_\odot)=5.8$, respectively. The
measured metallicity gradient is $-0.36 \pm 0.04$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ corresponding
to $-0.049 \pm 0.006$ dex R$_\mathrm{e}^{-1}$ for the continuum effective
radius of $R_\mathrm{e} = 0.14$ kpc. Our observation has successfully
demonstrated that three-dimensional spectroscopy with 8m-class telescopes is
powerful enough to reveal the metallicity distribution in local EMPGs,

In
RTB, an advertiser can participate in bidding ad impressions to display its

according to its bidding strategy. Therefore, a good bidding strategy can help
advertisers improve cost efficiency. This paper focuses on optimizing a single
advertiser's bidding strategy using reinforcement learning (RL) in RTB.
Unfortunately, it is challenging to optimize the bidding strategy through RL at
the granularity of impression due to the highly dynamic nature of the RTB
environment. In this paper, we first utilize a widely accepted linear bidding
function to compute every impression's base price and optimize it by a mutable
adjustment factor derived from the RTB auction environment, to avoid optimizing
every impression's bidding price directly. Specifically, we use the maximum
entropy RL algorithm (Soft Actor-Critic) to optimize the adjustment factor
generation policy at the impression-grained level. Finally, the empirical study
on a public dataset demonstrates that the proposed bidding strategy has
superior performance compared with the baselines.

(SVS) methods that build encoder-decoder neural networks to directly generate

attenuate these issues, this paper presents a novel acoustic model with
independent pitch encoder and phoneme encoder, which disentangles the phoneme
and pitch information from music score to fully utilize the corpus.
Specifically, according to equal temperament theory, the pitch encoder is
constrained by a pitch metric loss that maps distances between adjacent input
pitches into corresponding frequency multiples between the encoder outputs. For
the phoneme encoder, based on the analysis that same phonemes corresponding to
varying pitches can produce similar pronunciations, this encoder is followed by
an adversarially trained pitch classifier to enforce the identical phonemes
with different pitches mapping into the same phoneme feature space. By these
means, the sparse phonemes and pitches in original input spaces can be
transformed into more compact feature spaces respectively, where the same
elements cluster closely and cooperate mutually to enhance synthesis quality.
Then, the outputs of the two encoders are summed together to pass through the
following decoder in the acoustic model. Experimental results indicate that the
proposed approaches can characterize intrinsic structure between pitch inputs
to obtain better pitch synthesis accuracy and achieve superior singing
synthesis performance against the advanced baseline system.

The results show that a gray-box model yields increased prediction accuracy
over a physics-based model in the presence of process-model mismatch. They also
show improvements over a data-driven model when the amount of available data is

mutability. The emerging \move programming language was designed to support
strong encapsulation and static verification in the service of secure smart

a theoretical framework like robust safety.
  In this paper, we define robust safety for the \move language and introduce a
generic framework for static tools that wish to enforce it. Our framework
consists of two abstract components: a program verifier that can prove an
invariant holds in a closed-world setting (e.g., the Move Prover), and a novel
\emph{encapsulator} that checks if the verifier's result generalizes to an
open-world setting. We formalise an escape analysis as an instantiation of the

paper presents a survey of biometric template protection (BTP) methods proposed
for securing face templates (images/features) in neural-network-based face
recognition systems. The BTP methods are categorised into two types: Non-NN and
NN-learned. Non-NN methods use a neural network (NN) as a feature extractor,
but the BTP part is based on a non-NN algorithm, whereas NN-learned methods
employ a NN to learn a protected template from the unprotected template. We
present examples of Non-NN and NN-learned face BTP methods from the literature,
along with a discussion of their strengths and weaknesses. We also investigate
the techniques used to evaluate these methods in terms of the three most common
BTP criteria: recognition accuracy, irreversibility, and
renewability/unlinkability. The recognition accuracy of protected face
recognition systems is generally evaluated using the same (empirical)
techniques employed for evaluating standard (unprotected) biometric systems.
However, most irreversibility and renewability/unlinkability evaluations are
found to be based on theoretical assumptions/estimates or verbal implications,
with a lack of empirical validation in a practical face recognition context.
So, we recommend a greater focus on empirical evaluations to provide more
concrete insights into the irreversibility and renewability/unlinkability of
face BTP methods in practice. Additionally, an exploration of the
reproducibility of the studied BTP works, in terms of the public availability
of their implementation code and evaluation datasets/procedures, suggests that
it would be difficult to faithfully replicate most of the reported findings.
So, we advocate for a push towards reproducibility, in the hope of advancing
face BTP research.

phenomena, when they change the structure of the system, for instance in the
case of multistability, or when they have a huge impact. Rare event algorithms
have been devised to simulate them efficiently, avoiding the computation of
long periods of typical fluctuations. We consider here the family of splitting
or cloning algorithms, which are versatile and specifically suited for
far-from-equilibrium dynamics. To be efficient, these algorithms need to use a
smart score function during the selection stage. Committor functions are the
optimal score functions. In this work we propose a new approach, based on the
analogue Markov chain, for a data-based learning of approximate committor
functions. We demonstrate that such learned committor functions are extremely
efficient score functions when used with the Adaptive Multilevel Splitting
algorithm. We illustrate our approach for a gradient dynamics in a three-well
potential, and for the Charney-DeVore model, which is a paradigmatic toy model
of multistability for atmospheric dynamics. For these two dynamics, we show
that having observed a few transitions is enough to have a very efficient
data-based score function for the rare event algorithm. This new approach is
promising for use for complex dynamics: the rare events can be simulated with a
minimal prior knowledge and the results are much more precise than those
obtained with a user-designed score function.

build the model for I2I translation among continuous varying domains. We first
divide the whole domain coverage into discrete intervals, and explicitly model
the latent style code for the center of each interval. To deal with continuous
translation, we design the editing modules, changing the latent style code
along two directions. These editing modules help to constrain the codes for
domain centers during training, so that the model can better understand the

diversified with either the random noise or features from the reference image,
giving the individual style code to the decoder for label-based or

substantial differences. Particularly, the label-based synthesis reflects the
common characteristics of the target domain, and the reference-based shows the
specific style similar to the reference. This paper intends to bridge the gap
between them in the task of multi-attribute I2IT. We design the label- and
reference-based encoding modules (LEM and REM) to compare the domain
differences. They first transfer the source image and target label (or
reference) into a common embedding space, by providing the opposite directions
through the attribute difference vector. Then the two embeddings are simply
fused together to form the latent code S_rand (or S_ref), reflecting the domain
style differences, which is injected into each layer of the generator by SPADE.
To link LEM and REM, so that two types of results benefit each other, we
encourage the two latent codes to be close, and set up the cycle consistency
between the forward and backward translations on them. Moreover, the
interpolation between the S_rand and S_ref is also used to synthesize an extra
image. Experiments show that label- and reference-based synthesis are indeed
mutually promoted, so that we can have the diverse results from LEM, and high
quality results with the similar style of the reference.

critiquing. We propose an alternate view, where instead of keyphrase based
critiques, a user is provided 'knobs' in a disentangled latent space, with each
knob corresponding to an item aspect. Disentanglement here refers to a latent
space where generative factors (here, a preference towards an item category
like genre) are captured independently in their respective dimensions, thereby
enabling predictable manipulations, otherwise not possible in an entangled
space. We propose using a (semi-)supervised disentanglement objective for this
purpose, as well as multiple metrics to evaluate the controllability and the
degree of personalization of controlled recommendations. We show that by
updating the disentangled latent space based on user feedback, and by
exploiting the generative nature of the recommender, controlled and
personalized recommendations can be produced. Through experiments on two widely
used collaborative filtering datasets, we demonstrate that a controllable
recommender can be trained with a slight reduction in recommender performance,
provided enough supervision is provided. The recommendations produced by these

Resistivity data suggest Cr$_{0.79}$Se to be a Fermi-liquid-type metal at low

that is robust with respect to the increase of the number of groups and
suitable for multi-GPU parallel computation. We first observe that the group
convolution can be interpreted as a one-level block Jacobi approximation of the
standard convolution, which is a popular notion in the field of numerical
analysis. In numerical analysis, there have been numerous studies on the
two-level method that introduces an intergroup structure that resolves the
performance degradation issue without disturbing parallel computation.
Motivated by these, we introduce a coarse-level structure which promotes
intergroup communication without being a bottleneck in the group convolution.
We show that all the additional work induced by the coarse-level structure can
be efficiently processed in a distributed memory system. Numerical results that
verify the robustness of the proposed method with respect to the number of

tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in Fe/MgO/Fe and similar magnetic tunnel
junctions (MTJs), providing room temperature functionality in modern spin
electronics. However, the core process of the electron symmetry filtering
breaks down under applied bias, dramatically reducing the TMR above 0.5 V. This
strongly hampers the application range of MTJs. To circumvent the problem,
resonant tunneling between ferromagnetic electrodes through quantum well states
in thin layers has been used so far. This mechanism, however, is mainly
effective at low temperatures. Here, a fundamentally different approach is
demonstrated, providing a strong TMR boost under applied bias in
V/MgO/Fe/MgO/Fe/Co hybrids. This pathway uses spin orbit coupling (SOC)
controlled interfacial states in vanadium, which contrary to the V(001) bulk
states are allowed to tunnel to Fe(001) at low biases. The experimentally
observed strong increase of TMR with bias is modelled using two nonlinear
resistances in series, with the low bias conductance of the first (V/MgO/Fe)
element being boosted by the SOC-controlled interfacial states, while the
conductance of the second (Fe/MgO/Fe) junctions controlled by the relative
alignment of the two ferromagnetic layers. These results pave a way to
unexplored and fundamentally different spintronic device schemes, with
tunneling magnetoresistance uplifted under applied electric bias.

examine how the $\omega$-isotropy of an invariant manifold N relates to the
entropy of the dynamics it carries. Central to our study is Yomdin's
inequality, and a refinement obtained using that the local entropies have no
effect transversally to the characteristic foliation of N. When (M, $\omega$)

of the primitive of $\omega$, under the condition that the dynamics acts
trivially on the cohomology of degree 1 of N. The conclusion partially extends
to the case when N has a relatively compact one-sided orbit. We eventually
prove the uniqueness of invariant submanifolds N when M is a cotangent bundle,

account the geometrical complexity. To overcome this difficulty and to avoid
the expensive mesh generation, geometrically unfitted methods, i.e. the
numerical methods using the simple computational meshes that do not fit the
boundary of the domain, and/or the internal interfaces, have been widely
developed. In the present work, we investigate the performances of an unfitted
method called $\phi$-FEM that converges optimally and uses classical finite
element spaces so that it can be easily implemented using general FEM
libraries. The main idea is to take into account the geometry thanks to a level
set function describing the boundary or the interface. Up to now, the
$\phi$-FEM approach has been proposed, tested and substantiated mathematically
only in some simplest settings: Poisson equation with Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin
boundary conditions. Our goal here is to demonstrate its applicability to some
more sophisticated governing equations arising in the computational mechanics.
We consider the linear elasticity equations accompanied by either pure
Dirichlet boundary conditions or by the mixed ones (Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary conditions co-existing on parts of the boundary), an interface problem
(linear elasticity with material coefficients abruptly changing over an
internal interface), a model of elastic structures with cracks, and finally the
heat equation. In all these settings, we derive an appropriate variant of
$\phi$-FEM and then illustrate it by numerical tests on manufactured solutions.
We also compare the accuracy and efficiency of $\phi$-FEM with those of the
standard fitted FEM on the meshes of similar size, revealing the substantial
gains that can be achieved by $\phi$-FEM in both the accuracy and the
computational time.

computer vision, robotics perception, photogrammetry and remote sensing, which
seeks to estimate the best rigid transformation between two point clouds from
the correspondences established over 3D keypoints. However, due to limited
robustness and accuracy, current 3D keypoint matching techniques are very prone
to yield outliers, probably even in very large numbers, making robust
estimation for point cloud registration of great importance. Unfortunately,
existing robust methods may suffer from high computational cost or insufficient
robustness when encountering high (or even extreme) outlier ratios, hardly
ideal enough for practical use. In this paper, we present a novel
time-efficient RANSAC-type consensus maximization solver, named DANIEL
(Double-layered sAmpliNg with consensus maximization based on stratIfied
Element-wise compatibiLity), for robust registration. DANIEL is designed with
two layers of random sampling, in order to find inlier subsets with the lowest
computational cost possible. Specifically, we: (i) apply the rigidity
constraint to prune raw outliers in the first layer of one-point sampling, (ii)
introduce a series of stratified element-wise compatibility tests to conduct
rapid compatibility checking between minimal models so as to realize more
efficient consensus maximization in the second layer of two-point sampling, and
(iii) probabilistic termination conditions are employed to ensure the timely
return of the final inlier set. Based on a variety of experiments over multiple
real datasets, we show that DANIEL is robust against over 99% outliers and also
significantly faster than existing state-of-the-art robust solvers (e.g.
RANSAC, FGR, GORE).

is widely used for few-shot learning because it classifies unseen examples by
constructing class-specific prototypes without adjusting hyper-parameters
during meta-testing. Interestingly, recent research has attracted a lot of
attention, showing that training a new linear classifier, which does not use a
meta-learning algorithm, performs comparably with the prototypical network.
However, the training of a new linear classifier requires the retraining of the
classifier every time a new class appears. In this paper, we analyze how a
prototype classifier works equally well without training a new linear
classifier or meta-learning. We experimentally find that directly using the
feature vectors, which is extracted by using standard pre-trained models to
construct a prototype classifier in meta-testing, does not perform as well as
the prototypical network and training new linear classifiers on the feature
vectors of pre-trained models. Thus, we derive a novel generalization bound for
a prototypical classifier and show that the transformation of a feature vector
can improve the performance of prototype classifiers. We experimentally
investigate several normalization methods for minimizing the derived bound and
find that the same performance can be obtained by using the L2 normalization
and minimizing the ratio of the within-class variance to the between-class
variance without training a new classifier or meta-learning.

distributed output measurements (distributed sensors) and unknown inputs is
addressed in this paper. The objective is to design a network of observers such
that the state vector of the entire system can be estimated, while each
observer (or node) has access to only local output measurements that may not be
sufficient on its own to reconstruct the entire system's state. Existing
results in the literature on distributed state estimation assume either that
the system does not have inputs, or that all the system's inputs are globally
known to all the observers. Accordingly, we address this gap by proposing a
distributed observer capable of estimating the overall system's state in the
presence of inputs, while each node only has limited local information on
inputs and outputs. We provide a design method that guarantees convergence of
the estimation errors under some mild joint detectability conditions. This
design suits undirected communication graphs that may have switching topologies
and also applies to strongly connected directed graphs. We also give existence
conditions that harmonize with existing results on unknown input observers.
Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimation
scheme for various scenarios.

anti-spoofing. The variations of the performance with different choices of
timefrequency resolutions can be as large as those with different model
architectures, which makes it difficult to judge what the improvement actually
comes from when a new network architecture is invented and introduced as the
classifier. In this paper, we propose a multi-resolution front-end for feature
extraction in an end-to-end classification framework. Optimal weighted
combinations of multiple time-frequency resolutions will be learned
automatically given the objective of a classification task. Features extracted
with different time-frequency resolutions are weighted and concatenated as
inputs to the successive networks, where the weights are predicted by a
learnable neural network inspired by the weighting block in
squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENet). Furthermore, the refinement of the
chosen timefrequency resolutions is investigated by pruning the ones with
relatively low importance, which reduces the complexity and size of the model.
The proposed method is evaluated on the tasks of speech anti-spoofing in
ASVSpoof 2019 and its superiority has been justified by comparing with similar
baselines.

pose-focused feature embedding and makes subsequent modules computationally

investigate the FOM-ROM consistency, i.e., whether the numerical stabilization
is beneficial both at the FOM and the ROM level. As a numerical stabilization
strategy, we focus on the evolve-filter-relax (EFR) regularization algorithm,
which centers around spatial filtering. To investigate the FOM-ROM consistency,
we consider two ROM strategies: (i) the EFR-ROM, in which the EFR stabilization
is used at the FOM level, but not at the ROM level; and (ii) the EFR-EFRROM, in
which the EFR stabilization is used both at the FOM and at the ROM level. We
compare the EFR-ROM with the EFR-EFRROM in the numerical simulation of a 2D

Unlike most other machines, they can traverse extremely
complex environments at high speeds. To date, only expert human pilots have
been able to fully exploit their capabilities. Autonomous operation with
on-board sensing and computation has been limited to low speeds.
State-of-the-art methods generally separate the navigation problem into
subtasks: sensing, mapping, and planning. While this approach has proven
successful at low speeds, the separation it builds upon can be problematic for
high-speed navigation in cluttered environments. Indeed, the subtasks are
executed sequentially, leading to increased processing latency and a
compounding of errors through the pipeline. Here we propose an end-to-end
approach that can autonomously fly quadrotors through complex natural and
man-made environments at high speeds, with purely onboard sensing and
computation. The key principle is to directly map noisy sensory observations to
collision-free trajectories in a receding-horizon fashion. This direct mapping
drastically reduces processing latency and increases robustness to noisy and
incomplete perception. The sensorimotor mapping is performed by a convolutional
network that is trained exclusively in simulation via privileged learning:
imitating an expert with access to privileged information. By simulating
realistic sensor noise, our approach achieves zero-shot transfer from
simulation to challenging real-world environments that were never experienced
during training: dense forests, snow-covered terrain, derailed trains, and
collapsed buildings. Our work demonstrates that end-to-end policies trained in
simulation enable high-speed autonomous flight through challenging
environments, outperforming traditional obstacle avoidance pipelines.

to meet higher standards not only in accuracy but also with respect to

trade-off between accuracy and explainability.
  One explainable approach is case-based reasoning (CBR), where each decision
is supported by specific previous cases. However, such methods can be wanting

allows for errors both in the function and in its gradient. For this situation,
a gradient method with an adaptive adjustment of some parameters of the model
is proposed and an estimate for the convergence rate is found. This estimate is
optimal on a class of sufficiently smooth problems in the presence of errors.
We consider a special class of convex nonsmooth optimization problems. In order
to apply the proposed technique to this class, an artificial error should be
introduced. We show that the method can be modified for such problems to
guarantee a convergence in the function with a nearly optimal rate on the class
of convex nonsmooth optimization problems. An adaptive gradient method is
proposed for objective functions with some relaxation of the Lipschitz
condition for the gradient that satisfy the Polyak--Lojasievicz gradient
dominance condition. Here, the objective function and its gradient can be given
inexactly. The adaptive choice of the parameters is performed during the
operation of the method with respect to both the Lipschitz constant of the
gradient and a value corresponding to the error of the gradient and the
objective function. The linear convergence of the method is justified up to a

smooth, compensated spherical top-hats as a proxy for the non-linear regime.
Using the Hu-Sawicki model as a working example, we solve the coupled
continuity, Euler and Einstein equations using an iterative hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian scheme. The novel aspect of this scheme is that the metric
potentials are solved for analytically in the Eulerian frame. The evolution is
assumed to follow GR at very early epochs and switches to $f(R)$ at a
pre-determined epoch. Choosing the `switching epoch' too early is
computationally expensive because of high frequency oscillations; choosing it
too late potentially destroys consistency with $\Lambda$CDM. To make an
informed choice, we perform an eigenvalue analysis of the background model
which gives a ballpark estimate of the magnitude of oscillations. There are two
length scales in the problem: the comoving Compton wavelength of the associated
scalar field and the width of the top-hat. The evolution is determined by their
ratio. When the ratio is large, the evolution is scale-independent and the
density-velocity divergence relation (DVDR) is unique. When the ratio is small,
the evolution is very close to GR, except for the formation of a spike near the
top-hat edge, a feature which has been noted in earlier literature. We are able
to qualitatively explain this feature in terms of the analytic solution for the
metric potentials, in the absence of the chameleon mechanism. In the
intermediate regime, the evolution is profile-dependent and no unique DVDR
exists.

applications, with one such major weakness being their sample-inefficiency. In
an effort to patch these issues, we integrated a meta-learning technique in
order to shift the objective of learning to solve a task into the objective of
learning how to learn to solve a task (or a set of tasks), which we empirically
show that improves overall stability and performance of Deep RL algorithms. Our
model, named REIN-2, is a meta-learning scheme formulated within the RL
framework, the goal of which is to develop a meta-RL agent (meta-learner) that
learns how to produce other RL agents (inner-learners) that are capable of
solving given environments. For this task, we convert the typical interaction
of an RL agent with the environment into a new, single environment for the
meta-learner to interact with. Compared to traditional state-of-the-art Deep RL
algorithms, experimental results show remarkable performance of our model in
popular OpenAI Gym environments in terms of scoring and sample efficiency,
including the Mountain Car hard-exploration environment.

  Underwater Acoustic OFDM Systems","6 pages, 5 figures, conference",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of frequency-domain inter-carrier
interference (ICI) mitigation for differential orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The classical fractional fast Fourier transform
(F-FFT), adopting the fixed sampling interval, would suffer from the limited
accuracy of ICI mitigation and low adaptability in dynamic Doppler spread. To
target the above challenges, we propose an adaptive fractional Fourier
transform (A-FFT) demodulation method, in which an estimation algorithm based
on the coordinate descent approach is designed to compute the fiducial
frequency offset without increasing pilots. By means of compensating ICI at
fractions of the fiducial frequency offset adapted to the time-varying Doppler
shift, the A-FFT has the capability of tracking Doppler fluctuations over the
underwater acoustic channels, thus extending the application range of
frequency-domain ICI mitigation. Simulation results show that the A-FFT is
significantly superior to the existing classical methods, the partial fast
Fourier transform (P-FFT) and the F-FFT, for both medium and high Doppler
factors and large carrier numbers in terms of the mean squared error (MSE).
Numerically, the MSE of the A-FFT is reduced by $\bf{39.88\%-72.14\%}$ compared
to that of the F-FFT with the input signal-to-noise ratio ranging from 10 dB to
30 dB at a Doppler factor of $\bf{2.5\times 10^{-4}}$ and a carrier number of
1024, while the P-FFT even cannot work well.

probabilities by changing the `Attention Mask' input to create more efficacious

exploited datasets (by BERT tokenizer). Then, we apply Multinomial Naive Bayes
to map these tokens to two probabilities. These probabilities indicate the
likelihood of making a text non-offensive or offensive, provided that it
contains that token. Afterwards, we use these probabilities to define a new
term, namely Offensive Score. Next, we create two separate (because of the
differences in the types of the employed datasets) equations based on Offensive
Scores for each language to re-distribute the `Attention Mask' input for paying
more attention to more offensive phrases. Eventually, we put the F1-macro score
as our evaluation metric and fine-tune several combinations of BERT with ANNs,
CNNs and RNNs to examine the effect of using this methodology on various
combinations. The results indicate that all models will enhance with this

Brillouin zone through a boundary angle $\alpha$. Electron backscattering by
acoustic phonons via the deformation potential causes a finite resistivity
which we evaluate by means of the semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We find
that low-energy transport is dominated by surface states, where transport
observables are highly sensitive to the angle $\alpha$ and to Aharonov-Bohm
phases due to $\Phi$. A generic subband dispersion relation allows for either
one or two pairs of Fermi points. In the latter case, intra-node backscattering
is possible and implies a parametrically larger resistivity than for a single
Fermi point pair. As a consequence, large and abrupt resistivity changes take
place across the transition points separating parameter regions with a
different number of Fermi point pairs in a given subband.

understanding and reflecting end-users' human values (e.g., transparency,

Violations of end users' values by software applications have been reported in
the media and have resulted in a wide range of difficulties for end users.
Value violations may bring more and lasting problems for marginalized and
vulnerable groups of end-users. This research aims to understand the extent to
which the values of Bangladeshi female farmers, marginalized and vulnerable
end-users, who are less studied by the software engineering community, are
reflected in agriculture apps in Bangladesh. Further to this, we aim to
identify possible strategies to embed their values in those apps. To this end,
we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study consisting of 13 interviews with
app practitioners and four focus groups with 20 Bangladeshi female farmers. The
accumulated results from the interviews and focus groups identified 22 values
of Bangladeshi female farmers, which the participants expect to be reflected in
the agriculture apps. Among these 22 values, 15 values (e.g., accuracy,
independence) are already reflected and 7 values (e.g., accessibility,
pleasure) are ignored/violated in the existing agriculture apps. We also
identified 14 strategies (e.g., ""applying human-centered approaches to elicit
values"", ""establishing a dedicated team/person for values concerns"") to address
Bangladeshi female farmers' values in agriculture apps.

motivated by the recently claimed observation of a narrow structure in the

existence of this structure cannot be confirmed in the present work. Instead,
for E$_{\gamma}$ = 1400 - 1500 MeV and the cut M$_{p\pi^0} \le 1190 $ MeV/$c^2$
a statistically significant structure in the M$_{p\eta}$ invariant mass
distribution near 1700 MeV/$c^2$ is observed with a width of $\Gamma\approx 35$
MeV/$c^2$ while the mass resolution is $\sigma_{res}$ = 5 MeV/$c^2$. Increasing
the incident photon energy from 1420 to 1540 MeV this structure shifts in mass
from $\approx$ 1700MeV/c$^2$ to $\approx$ 1725 MeV/$c^2$; the width increases
to about 50 MeV/$c^2$ and decreases thereafter. The cross section associated
with this structure reaches a maximum of $\approx$ 100 nb around E$_{\gamma}
\approx$ 1490 MeV (W $\approx $ 1920 MeV), which coincides with the $p a_0$
threshold. Three scenarios are discussed which might be the origin of this

we found the regions of stability for every physical specific heat together
with the existing Davies curves. Another central result is the generalization
of the notion of global thermodynamic stability, known from the standard
thermodynamics, to describe the global equilibrium of black holes. The new
approach consists of applying specific Legendre transformation of the energy or
the entropy to find the natural thermodynamic potential for the given ensemble
of macro parameters. The global stability analysis, restricted to the week
positivity conjecture is based on the properties of the new thermodynamic
potential. The advantage of this method is that it allows one to chose
different potentials, corresponding to different constraints to which the
system may be subjected. Finally, we find it natural to impose global
thermodynamic stability only where local one exists for the given black hole

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is mainly studied in a setting where the
training and the testing environments are similar. But in many practical
applications, these environments may differ. For instance, in control systems,
the robot(s) on which a policy is learned might differ from the robot(s) on
which a policy will run. It can be caused by different internal factors (e.g.,
calibration issues, system attrition, defective modules) or also by external
changes (e.g., weather conditions). There is a need to develop RL methods that
generalize well to variations of the training conditions. In this article, we
consider the simplest yet hard to tackle generalization setting where the test
environment is unknown at train time, forcing the agent to adapt to the
system's new dynamics. This online adaptation process can be computationally
expensive (e.g., fine-tuning) and cannot rely on meta-RL techniques since there
is just a single train environment. To do so, we propose an approach where we
learn a subspace of policies within the parameter space. This subspace contains
an infinite number of policies that are trained to solve the training
environment while having different parameter values. As a consequence, two

end-to-end trainable approach, called regional contrastive consistency
regularization (RCCR) for domain adaptive semantic segmentation. Our core idea
is to pull the similar regional features extracted from the same location of
different images, i.e., the original image and augmented image, to be closer,
and meanwhile push the features from the different locations of the two images
to be separated. We innovatively propose a region-wise contrastive loss with
two sampling strategies to realize effective regional consistency. Besides, we
present momentum projection heads, where the teacher projection head is the
exponential moving average of the student. Finally, a memory bank mechanism is
designed to learn more robust and stable region-wise features under varying
environments. Extensive experiments on two common UDA benchmarks, i.e., GTAV to
Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, demonstrate that our approach outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods.

univariate risks in numerous actuarial applications. Their multivariate
counterparts (MPH$^\ast$), however, have not seen such a proliferation, due to
lack of explicit formulas and complicated estimation procedures. A simple
construction of multivariate phase-type distributions -- mPH -- is proposed for
the parametric description of multivariate risks, leading to models of
considerable probabilistic flexibility and statistical tractability. The main
idea is to start different Markov processes at the same state, and allow them
to evolve independently thereafter, leading to dependent absorption times. By
dimension augmentation arguments, this construction can be cast into the
umbrella of MPH$^\ast$ class, but enjoys explicit formulas which the general
specification lacks, including common measures of dependence. Moreover, it is
shown that the class is still rich enough to be dense on the set of
multivariate risks supported on the positive orthant, and it is the smallest
known sub-class to have this property. In particular, the latter result
provides a new short proof of the denseness of the MPH$^\ast$ class. In
practice this means that the mPH class allows for modeling of bivariate risks
with any given correlation or copula. We derive an EM algorithm for its
statistical estimation, and illustrate it on bivariate insurance data.
Extensions to more general settings are outlined.

of quantum mechanics as well as its other properties such as nonlocality derive
from chaotic flow of 4D spacetime through a 5th dimension, with the metric
tensor under Wick rotation to Euclidean space acting as a heat bath for other
quantum fields. This is done by showing that the theory meets mixing conditions

it is coupled, such that in the limit taking chaotic dynamics scale to zero the
quantization is equivalent to a stochastic quantization. A classical stability
analysis shows this dimension is likely spacelike.

low-dimensional materials, such as one-dimensional organic polymer chains or
quasi-one-dimensional graphene nanoribbons, intriguing manipulation of the
optical properties, such as the absorption cross section, is possible. The most
widely used approach to couple quantum emitters to optical antennas is based on
the Purcell effect. This formalism, however, does not comprise charge transfer
from the emitter to the antenna, but only spontaneous emission of the quantum
emitter into the tailored photonic environment, that is evoked by the antenna.
To capture such effects, we present a tight-binding formalism to couple an
adatom to a finite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, where the former is treated as a
two-level system and the latter acts as an optical antenna. We systematically
analyze how the coupling strength and the position of the adatom influence the
optical properties of the molecular chains in the model. We take into account
charge transfer from the adatom to the antenna and vice versa via an
inter-system hopping parameter, and also include Coulomb interaction within the
antenna as well as between the adatom and the antenna. We show that coupling
the adatom to one of the bulk atoms of the linear chain results in a
substantial change in optical properties already for comparatively small
coupling strengths. We also find that the position of the adatom crucially
determines if and how the optical properties of the chains are altered.
Therefore, we identify this adatom-chain hybrid system as a tunable platform
for light-matter interaction at the nanoscale.

based saliency methods benefit from faster speed, and they are widely used in
downstream visual tasks. Thus, we focus on single backward pass based methods.
However, existing methods in this category struggle to uccessfully produce
fine-grained saliency maps concentrating on specific target classes. That said,
producing faithful saliency maps satisfying both target-selectiveness and
fine-grainedness using a single backward pass is a challenging problem in the
field. To mitigate this problem, we revisit the gradient flow inside the

the propagation of target-relevant saliency. Inspired by those observations, we

Backprop (TSGB), which leverages rectification operations to effectively
emphasize target classes and further efficiently propagate the saliency to the
image space, thereby generating target-selective and fine-grained saliency

Rayleigh-Plateau instability simulations show that both the CG and SC models
give physically realistic results when breakup occurs, although smaller

evaporating into the ambient phase. Our results show that the CG model is a
suitable choice for challenging simulations of droplet formation, due to a
combination of both numerical stability and physical accuracy. We also present
a novel approach to incorporate repulsion forces between interfaces for CG,

structure of the escaping atmosphere begins to break away from a comet-like
tail following the planet ($B_p=0$), as we see more absorbing material above
and below the orbital plane. For $B_p\geq3$G, we find a ``dead-zone'' around
the equator, where low velocity material is trapped in the closed magnetic
field lines. The dead-zone separates two polar outflows where absorbing
material escapes along open field lines, leading to a double tail structure,
above and below the orbital plane. We demonstrate that atmospheric escape in
magnetised planets occurs through polar outflows, as opposed to the
predominantly night-side escape in non-magnetised models. We find a small
increase in escape rate with $B_p$, though this should not affect the timescale
of atmospheric loss. As the size of the dead-zone increases with $B_p$, so does
the line centre absorption in Lyman-$\alpha$, as more low-velocity neutral
hydrogen covers the stellar disc during transit. For $B_p<3$G the absorption in
the blue wing decreases, as the escaping atmosphere is less funnelled along the
line of sight by the stellar wind. In the red wing (and for $B_p>3$G in the
blue wing) the absorption increases caused by the growing volume of the
magnetosphere. Finally we show that transits below and above the mid-disc

with star formation rates (SFRs) up to two orders of magnitude lower than
Herschel surveys and will thus boost the ability of radio astronomy to study
extragalactic sources. The tight infrared-radio correlation offers the
possibility of using radio emission as a dust-unobscured star formation
diagnostic. However, the physics governing the link between radio emission and
star formation is poorly understood, and recent studies have pointed to
differences in the exact calibration required when radio is to be used as a
star formation tracer. We improve the calibration of the relation of the local
radio luminosity--SFR and to test whether there are nonlinearities in it. We
used a sample of Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS)
sources and investigated their radio luminosity, which was derived using the
NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm
(FIRST) maps. We stacked the bins of infrared luminosity and SFR and accounted
for bins with no detections in the stacked images using survival analysis
fitting. This approach was tested using Monte Carlo simulations. After removing
sources from the sample that have excess radio emission, which is indicative of
nuclear radio activity, we found no deviations from linearity of the mean
relations between radio luminosity and either SFR or infrared luminosity. We
analyzed the link between radio emission and SFR or infrared luminosity using a
local sample of star-forming galaxies without evidence of nuclear radio
activity and found no deviations from linearity, although our data are also
consistent with the small nonlinearity reported by some recent analyses. The
normalizations of these relations are intermediate between those reported by
earlier works.

carefully utilizing the widespread supervision among the image-text pairs, our
De-CLIP can learn generic visual features more efficiently. Instead of using
the single image-text contrastive supervision, we fully exploit data potential
through the use of (1) self-supervision within each modality; (2) multi-view
supervision across modalities; (3) nearest-neighbor supervision from other
similar pairs. Benefiting from intrinsic supervision, our DeCLIP-ResNet50 can
achieve 60.4% zero-shot top1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 0.8% above the

treating the intermediate geophysical properties as latent variables. In such a
latent variable model, one needs to estimate the intractable likelihood of the

method is an adaptation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in which an
unbiased approximation of this likelihood is obtained by Monte Carlo averaging
over samples from, in this setting, the noisy petrophysical relationship
linking (hydro)geological and geophysical properties. To make the method
practical in data-rich geophysical settings with low noise levels, we
demonstrate that the Monte Carlo sampling must rely on importance sampling
distributions that well approximate the posterior distribution of petrophysical
scatter around the sampled (hydro)geological parameter field. To achieve a
suitable acceptance rate, we rely both on (1) the correlated pseudo-marginal
method, which correlates the samples used in the proposed and current states of
the Markov chain, and (2) a model proposal scheme that preserves the prior
distribution. As a synthetic test example, we infer porosity fields using
crosshole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) first-arrival travel times. We use a
(50x50)-dimensional pixel-based parameterization of the multi-Gaussian porosity
field with known statistical parameters, resulting in a parameter space of high

covers a wide range of frequency bands, from the millihertz band to the
audio-band, allowing for detections by both space-borne and ground-based
gravitational wave detectors. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on
the ability to constrain the Hubble constant using the dark standard sirens, or
gravitational wave events that lack electromagnetic counterparts. To acquire
the redshift information, we weight the galaxies within the localization error
box with photometric information from several bands and use them as a proxy for
the binary black hole redshift. We discover that TianQin is expected to
constrain the Hubble constant to a precision of roughly $30\%$ through
detections of $10$ gravitational wave events; in the most optimistic case, the
Hubble constant can be constrained to a precision of $< 10 \%$, assuming
TianQin I+II. In the optimistic case, the multi-detector network of TianQin and
LISA is capable of constraining the Hubble constant to within $5\%$ precision.
It is worth highlighting that the multi-band network of TianQin and Einstein
Telescope is capable of constraining the Hubble constant to a precision of
about $1\%$. We conclude that inferring the Hubble constant without bias from
photo-z galaxy catalog is achievable, and we also demonstrate self-consistency
using the P$-$P plot. On the other hand, high-quality spectroscopic redshift
information is crucial for improving the estimation precision of Hubble
constant.

  Given a $k$-list-assignment $L$ of a graph $G$, which is the assignment of a

topic for many regulatory downstream tasks, such as promoter classification,

regulatory elements interact with each other and its variability across
different cell types. However, current deep learning methods often focus on
modeling genome sequences of a fixed set of cell types and do not account for
the interaction between multiple regulatory elements, making them only perform
well on the cell types in the training set and lack the generalizability
required in biological applications. In this work, we propose a simple yet

take the 1d sequence of genome data and a 2d matrix of (transcription factors x

the robustness and generalizability of our model. We pre-train our model on the
ATAC-seq dataset with 17 million genome sequences. We evaluate our GeneBERT on

We infer their diversification history from Quercy Konzentrat--Lagerst{\""a}tte

show that cainotherioid diversity fluctuated through time, with extinction
events at the EOT and in the late Oligocene, and a major speciation burst in
the early Oligocene. The latter is in line with our finding that cainotherioids
had a high morphological adaptability following environmental changes
throughout the EOT, which probably played a key role in the survival and
evolutionary success of this clade in the aftermath. Speciation is positively
associated with temperature and continental fragmentation in a time-continuous
way, while extinction seems to synchronize with environmental change in a
punctuated way. Within-clade interactions negatively affected the cainotherioid
diversification, while inter-clade competition might explain their final
decline during the late Oligocene. Our results provide a detailed dynamic

how their functionalities can be boosted by this evolving technology. To show
the feasibility of the AM process, a prototype RFQ section has been designed,
corresponding to one-quarter of a 750 MHz 4-vane RFQ, which was optimised for

undergo phase segregation under light illumination due to halide ion migration,
affecting their optoelectronic properties. Here, we report photo-excitation
induced phase segregation in triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite films that
yields to red-shift in photoluminescence response. We demonstrate that
photo-excitation induced halide ion migration leads to the formation of
smaller-bandgap iodide-rich and larger-bandgap bromide-rich domains in the
perovskite film, where the phase segregation rate is found to follow the
excitation power-density as a power law. Results confirm that charge carrier
lifetime increases with redshift in photoluminescence due to the trapping of
photo-excited carriers in the segregated smaller-bandgap iodide-rich domains.
Interestingly, we found that these photo-induced changes are fully reversible
and thermally activated when the excitation power is turned off. A significant
difference in activation energies for halide ion migration is observed during
phase segregation and recovery process under darkness. Additionally, we have
investigated the emission linewidth broadening as a function of temperature
which is governed by the exciton-optical phonon coupling. The mechanism of
photo-induced phase segregation is interpreted based on excitonphonon coupling
strength in both mixed and demixed (segregated) states of perovskite film.

the primary black hole mass falls in the black hole mass gap, where the
pair-instability supernova prevents the formation of astrophysical black holes
in this range. In this paper, we systematically explore the prospect of TianQin
on detecting GW190521-like sources. For sources with small orbital
eccentricities, (i) TianQin could resolve up to a dozen of sources with
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) larger than 8. Even if the signal-to-noise ratio
threshold increases to 12, TianQin could still detect GW190521-like binaries.
(ii) The parameters of sources merging within several years would be precisely
recovered. The precision of coalescence time and sky localization closes to $1\
{\rm s}$ and $1\ {\rm deg^{2}}$ respectively. This indicates that TianQin could
provide early warnings for ground-based gravitational waves detectors and
electromagnetic telescopes for these sources. Furthermore, TianQin could
distinguish the formation channels of these sources by measuring the orbital
eccentricities with a relative precision of $10^{-4}$. (iii) TianQin could
constrain the Hubble constant with a $10\%$ precision with GW190521-like
sources. Finally, for very eccentric GW190521-like sources, although their
gravitational wave signal might be too weak for TianQin to detect, even the
null detection of TianQin could still present a significant contribution to the
understanding of the underlying science.

radio surveys, because they enable detailed investigation of the physics
governing radio-emitting regions such as active galaxies and their
environments. Cross-identification of radio sources with optical host galaxies
is challenging for this extended population, due to their morphological
complexity and multiple potential counterparts. In the first data release of
the Low-frequency array (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR1) the automated
likelihood ratio for compact sources was supplemented by a citizen science
visual identification process for extended sources. In this paper we present a
novel method for automating the host identification of extended sources by
using ridgelines, which trace the assumed direction of fluid-flow through the
points of highest flux density. Applying a new code, RL-Xid, to LoTSS DR1, we
demonstrate that ridgelines are versatile; by providing information about
spatial structure and brightness distributions, they can be used both for
optical host identification and morphological studies in radio surveys. RL-Xid
draws ridgelines for 85 per cent of sources brighter than 10 mJy and larger
than 15 arcsec, with an improved performance of 96 per cent for the subset >30
mJy and >60 arcsec. Using a sample of sources with known hosts from LoTSS DR1,
we demonstrate that RL-Xid successfully identifies the host for 98 per cent of
the sources with successfully drawn ridgelines, and performs at a comparable
level to visual identification via citizen science. We also demonstrate that
ridgeline brightness profiles provide a promising automated technique for
morphological classification.

synchronisation between individual antennas and study its inter-dependency with
the antenna density in detail. We find a strong correlation between the antenna
multiplicity (per event) and the maximum acceptable inaccuracy in the time
synchronisation of individual antennas. From this result, prerequisites for the
design of antenna arrays for the application of interferometric measurements
can be concluded. For data recorded with a time synchronisation accurate to
1$\,$ns within the commonly used frequency band of 30$\,$MHz to 80$\,$MHz, an
antenna multiplicity of $\gtrsim 50$ is needed to achieve an $X_\mathrm{max}$
reconstruction with an accuracy of 20$\,$g$\,$cm$^{-2}$. This multiplicity is
achieved measuring inclined air showers with zenith angles $\theta \geq
77.5^\circ$ with 1$\,$km spaced antenna arrays, while vertical air showers with
zenith angles $\theta \leq 40^\circ$ require an antenna spacing below 100$\,$m.
Furthermore, we find no improvement in $X_\mathrm{max}$ resolution applying the
interferometric reconstruction to measurements at higher frequencies, i.e., up
to several hundred MHz.

present an extensive theoretical study for a realistic multi-level

be achieved with minimal perturbations. Fortunately we are able to identify a
useful operating regime, where the frequency shifts remain small and
controllable, only weakly perturbing the clock transition for useful pumping

introduce a straightforward mapping of the multilevel pump scheme to an

artificial gauge fields. We propose an extension of the synthetic dimension
toolbox, making it possible to encode two dimensions within a large atomic
spin. The protocol combines first- and second-order spin couplings, such that
the spin projection $m$ and the remainder $r=m$ (mod 3) of its Euclidian
division by 3 act as orthogonal coordinates on a synthetic cylinder. It is
suited for an implementation with lanthanide atoms, which feature a large
electronic spin and narrow optical transitions for applying the required spin
couplings. This method is useful for simulating geometries with periodic
boundary conditions, and engineering various types of topological systems
evolving in high dimensions.

transfer learning capabilities and compare it with CNNs so that we can
understand which architecture is better when applied to real world problems
with small data. In this work, we follow a simple yet restrictive method for
fine-tuning both CNN and Transformer models pretrained on ImageNet1K on
CIFAR-10 and compare them with each other. We only unfreeze the last
transformer/encoder or last convolutional block of a model and freeze all the
layers before it while adding a simple MLP at the end for classification. This
simple modification lets us use the raw learned weights of both these neural
networks. From our experiments, we find out that transformers-based
architectures not only achieve higher accuracy than CNNs but some transformers
even achieve this feat with around 4 times lesser number of parameters.

(GTV) contouring relies on manual delineation of high labor-costs and interuser

(DL) multi-modality esophageal GTV contouring model, developed at 1 institution
whereas tested at multiple ones. Methods and Materials: We collected 606
esophageal cancer patients from four institutions. 252 institution-1 patients
had a treatment planning-CT (pCT) and a pair of diagnostic FDG-PETCT; 354
patients from other 3 institutions had only pCT. A two-streamed DL model for
GTV segmentation was developed using pCT and PETCT scans of a 148 patient
institution-1 subset. This built model had the flexibility of segmenting GTVs
via only pCT or pCT+PETCT combined. For independent evaluation, the rest 104
institution-1 patients behaved as unseen internal testing, and 354 institutions
2-4 patients were used for external testing. We evaluated manual revision
degrees by human experts to assess the contour-editing effort. The performance
of the deep model was compared against 4 radiation oncologists in a multiuser
study with 20 random external patients. Contouring accuracy and time were
recorded for the pre-and post-DL assisted delineation process. Results: Our
model achieved high segmentation accuracy in internal testing (mean Dice score:
0.81 using pCT and 0.83 using pCT+PET) and generalized well to external
evaluation (mean DSC: 0.80). Expert assessment showed that the predicted
contours of 88% patients need only minor or no revision. In multi-user
evaluation, with the assistance of a deep model, inter-observer variation and
required contouring time were reduced by 37.6% and 48.0%, respectively.
Conclusions: Deep learning predicted GTV contours were in close agreement with
the ground truth and could be adopted clinically with mostly minor or no
changes.

therefore transformed into variability along channels. A fundamental challenge
is to understand the role of non-linearities together with convolutional
filters in this transformation. ReLUs with biases are often interpreted as
thresholding operators that improve discrimination through sparsity. This paper
demonstrates that it is a different mechanism called phase collapse which
eliminates spatial variability while linearly separating classes. We show that
collapsing the phases of complex wavelet coefficients is sufficient to reach
the classification accuracy of ResNets of similar depths. However, replacing
the phase collapses with thresholding operators that enforce sparsity

rotating the potential in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the

communication. In this study, we explore possible effects of a temporal
decrease in the reliability of the communication channel, on a throughput of a
signalized intersection. We model road traffic and DSRC-VANET communication by
integrating the well-established traffic and communication simulation tools
(Vissim and OMNeT++). Comparisons of the perfect communication conditions with
challenging, but realistic conditions involving communication distortions show
that the adaptive intersection control may suffer from significantly increased
average delays of vehicles. The level of delays is largely independent of
whether the communication distortions affect all or only a single intersection
approach. For some signal groups, the average vehicle delays are significantly
increased, while for the others they are decreased, leading to the disbalance
and unfairness. We show that the data received in the previous time intervals
and simple assumptions about the vehicle movements can be used to estimate the
lost data. The compensation of the communication distortions affecting a single
intersection approach decreases the average vehicle delays. When the
communication distortions impacting all the intersection approaches are
compensated for, the vehicle delays are even set back to the levels comparable
with the perfect communication conditions. Overall, the results demonstrate
that the impact of the communication distortions should be considered in the
design of the adaptive intersection control algorithms.

This extension leads to new effects: if the mass matrix is not the same in
distant regions of space, but its eigenvalues coincide pairwise in both
regions, the particle masses stay constant in the whole spacetime, making the
model indistinguishable from a standard, low-energy and scalar Hermitian one.
However, contrary to the Hermitian case, the high-energy scalar particles
become unstable at a particular wavelength determined by the strength of the
emergent similarity gauge field. This instability corresponds to
momentum-dependent exceptional points, whose locations cannot be identified
from an analysis of the eigenvalues of the coordinate-dependent squared mass
matrix in isolation, as one might naively have expected. For a doublet of
scalar particles with masses of the order of 1 MeV and a similarity gauge
rotation of order unity at distances of 1 meter, the corrections to the masses
are about 10^{-7}eV, which makes no experimentally detectable imprint on the
low-energy spectrum. However, the instability occurs at 10^{18} eV,
suggestively in the energy range of detectable ultra-high-energy cosmic rays,
thereby making this truly non-Hermitian effect and its generalizations of
phenomenological interest for high-energy particle physics.

deep learning is that data owned by each node are usually non-independent and
identically distributed (non-IID), causing time-consuming convergence of model
training. To this end, we propose a decentralized learning model called
Homogeneous Learning (HL) for tackling non-IID data with a self-attention
mechanism. In HL, training performs on each round's selected node, and the
trained model of a node is sent to the next selected node at the end of each
round. Notably, for the selection, the self-attention mechanism leverages
reinforcement learning to observe a node's inner state and its surrounding
environment's state, and find out which node should be selected to optimize the
training. We evaluate our method with various scenarios for an image

Born's rule, this paper gives a self-contained deductive approach to quantum
mechanics and quantum measurement. A suggestive notion for what constitutes a
quantum detector and for the behavior of its responses leads to a logically
impeccable definition of measurement. Applications to measurement schemes for
optical states, position measurements and particle tracks demonstrate the
applicability to complex realistic experiments without any idealization.
  The various forms of quantum tomography for quantum states, quantum
detectors, quantum processes, and quantum instruments are discussed. The
traditional dynamical and spectral properties of quantum mechanics are derived
from a continuum limit of quantum processes, giving the Lindblad equation for
the density operator of a mixing quantum system and the Schr\""odinger equation
for the state vector of a pure, nonmixing quantum system. Normalized density
operators are shown to play the role of quantum phase space variables, in
complete analogy to the classical phase space variables position and momentum.
A slight idealization of the measurement process leads to the notion of quantum
fields, whose smeared quantum expectations emerge as reproducible properties of
regions of space accessible to measurements.
  The new approach is closer to actual practice than the traditional
foundations. It is more general, and therefore more powerful. It is simpler and
less technical than the traditional approach, and the standard tools of quantum
mechanics are not difficult to derive. This makes the new approach suitable for
introductory courses on quantum mechanics.
  A variety of quotes from the literature illuminate the formal exposition with
historical and philosophical aspects.

a local gap with a width of the order of the bulk gap and a spatial extent of

the line-deshadowing instability (LDI). In non-magnetic hot stars, the LDI
leads to the formation of an inhomogeneous wind consisting of small-scale,
spatially separated clumps that can have great effects on observational
diagnostics. However, for magnetic hot stars the LDI generated structures, wind
dynamics, and effects on observational diagnostics have not been directly
investigated so far. We investigated the non-linear development of LDI
generated structures and dynamics in a magnetic line-driven wind of a typical
O-supergiant. We employed two-dimensional axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of the LDI using the Smooth Source Function approximation for
evaluating the assumed one-dimensional line force. To facilitate the
interpretation of these magnetic models, they were compared with a
corresponding non-magnetic LDI simulation as well as a magnetic simulation
neglecting the LDI. A central result obtained is that the wind morphology and
wind clumping properties change strongly with increasing wind-magnetic
confinement. Most notably, in magnetically confined flows, the LDI leads to
large-scale, shellular sheets ('pancakes') that are quite distinct from the
spatially separate, small-scale clumps in non-magnetic line-driven winds. We
discuss the impact of these findings for observational diagnostic studies and
stellar evolution models of magnetic hot stars.

successful reasoning about agent-agent interactions. However, it remains
unclear which features such black-box models actually learn to use for making

of different cues to model performance based on a variant of Shapley values.
Applying this procedure to state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods on
standard benchmark datasets shows that they are, in fact, unable to reason
about interactions. Instead, the past trajectory of the target is the only
feature used for predicting its future. For a task with richer social
interaction patterns, on the other hand, the tested models do pick up such
interactions to a certain extent, as quantified by our feature attribution

explore the sensitivity of high harmonic generation (HHG) to the chirality of
molecules with a varying number of active chiral centers. We find that HHG
driven by bi-chromatic non-collinear lasers is a sensitive probe for the
stereo-configuration of a chiral molecule. We first show through calculations
(from benchmark chiral molecules with up to three chirality centers) that the
HHG spectrum is imprinted with information about the handedness of each

ordering near room temperature, has significant potential to become an enabling
platform for implementing novel spintronic and quantum devices. To pave the way
for applications, it is crucial to determine the magnetic properties when the
thickness of Fe5GeTe2 reaches the few-layers regime. However, this is highly
challenging due to the need for a characterization technique that is local,
highly sensitive, artifact-free, and operational with minimal fabrication.
Prior studies have indicated that Curie temperature TC can reach up to close to
room temperature for exfoliated Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ flakes, as measured via
electrical transport; there is a need to validate these results with a
measurement that reveals magnetism more directly. In this work, we investigate
the magnetic properties of exfoliated thin flakes of van der Waals magnet
Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ via a quantum magnetic imaging technique based on nitrogen
vacancy diamond. Through imaging the stray fields, we confirm room-temperature
magnetic order in Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ thin flakes with thickness down to 7 units
cell. The stray field patterns and their response to magnetizing fields with
different polarities point to a perpendicular easy-axis anisotropy.
Furthermore, we perform imaging at different temperatures and determine the
Curie temperature of the flakes at Tc~300 K. These results provide the basis
for realizing a room-temperature monolayer ferromagnet with Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$.
This work also demonstrates that the imaging technique enables a rapid
screening of multiple flakes simultaneously, thereby paving the way towards
high throughput characterization of potential 2D magnets near room temperature.

task. The models trained from synthetic data are difficult to generalize in
some surveys. Recently, training 3D fault segmentation using sparse manual 2D
slices is thought to yield promising results, but manual labeling has many
false negative labels (abnormal annotations), which is detrimental to training
and consequently to detection performance. Motivated to train 3D fault
segmentation networks under sparse 2D labels while suppressing false negative
labels, we analyze the training process gradient and propose the Mask Dice (MD)
loss. Moreover, the fault is an edge feature, and current encoder-decoder
architectures widely used for fault detection (e.g., U-shape network) are not
conducive to edge representation. Consequently, Fault-Net is proposed, which is
designed for the characteristics of faults, employs high-resolution propagation
features, and embeds MultiScale Compression Fusion block to fuse multi-scale
information, which allows the edge information to be fully preserved during
propagation and fusion, thus enabling advanced performance via few
computational resources. Experimental demonstrates that MD loss supports the
inclusion of human experience in training and suppresses false negative labels
therein, enabling baseline models to improve performance and generalize to more
surveys. Fault-Net is capable to provide a more stable and reliable
interpretation of faults, it uses extremely low computational resources and
inference is significantly faster than other models. Our method indicates
optimal performance in comparison with several mainstream methods.

matrix via molecular bonds is fundamental for many important processes in cell
biology and engineering. In these interactions, the deformability of cells and
matrix are usually comparable with that of the bonds, making their rebinding
events globally coupled with the deformation states of whole systems.
Unfortunately, this important principle is not realized or adopted in most
conventional theoretical models for analyzing cellular adhesions. In this
study, we considered a new theoretical model of a cluster of ligand-receptor
bonds between two soft elastic bodies, in which the rebinding rates of ligands
to receptors are described, for the first time, by considering the deformation
of the overall system under the influence of bond distributions. On the basis
of theory of continuum mechanics and statistical mechanics, we obtained an
elasticity-associated rebinding rate of open bonds in a closed analytical form
that highly depends on the binding states and distributions of all other bonds,
as well as on the overall deformation energy stored in the elastic bodies and
all closed bonds. On the basis of this elasticity-associated rebinding rate and
by performing Monte Carlo simulations, we uncovered new mechanisms underlying
the adhesion stability of molecular bond clusters associated with deformable
elastic bodies. Moreover, we revealed that the rebinding processes of molecular
bonds is not only dependent on interfacial separation but is related to overall
energy. This newly proposed rebinding rate may substantially improve our
understanding of how cells adapt to their microenvironments by adjusting their
mechanical properties through cytoskeleton remodeling and of how we can
accurately calibrate the measurements of adhesion strength of molecular bond
clusters between soft media.

by their non-thermal variable emission. This emission extends over the whole
electromagnetic spectrum and is a consequence of particle acceleration inside
their relativistic jets. However, especially the relation of radio emission to
that at higher frequencies remains an open question. Aims. Observations of
blazar emission show that the location of radio might be very different from
the one where the rest of the spectrum is produced and often requires separate
modeling. We aim to produce both emissions within the context of one model.
Methods. We construct a self-consistent one-zone expanding leptonic model for
studying the connection between the radio emission and the emission at higher
frequencies and we apply it to the flaring states of blazars. Assuming an
accelerating episode as the source moves down the jet and expands, we
numerically study the electron evolution as they lose energy due to adiabatic
expansion and synchrotron/inverse Compton radiation. Results. We find that
high-frequency radiation mimics the electron injection and is mainly produced
close to the acceleration site where cooling is strong. In contrast, the radio
emission is produced further down the jet when the emitting region has become
optically thin to synchrotron self-absorption due to expansion. We present
briefly the role of the initial parameters, such as the magnetic field
strength, the electron luminosity and expansion velocity, on the localization
of the radio emission site. We show that the expanding one-zone model is
inherently different from the non-expanding one and, in addition, it requires
more parameters. For example, we apply our approach to the observational data
of a Mrk 421 $\gamma$-ray - radio flare observed in 2013.

quantum mechanics in particular, we propose the notions of Schrodinger,
Whitehead, and complete compositionality. Accounting for recent important
developments in quantum technology and artificial intelligence, these do not
have the bottom-up meaning flow as part of their definitions.
  Schrodinger compositionality accommodates quantum theory, and also
meaning-as-context. Complete compositionality further strengthens Schrodinger
compositionality in order to single out theories like ZX-calculus, that are
complete with regard to the intended model. All together, our new notions aim

algorithms to find solutions quickly at the expense of quality. For large state
spaces, it can be beneficial to search for solutions across multiple
resolutions even though defining the discretisations is challenging. The
recently proposed algorithm Multi-Resolution A* (MRA*) searches over multiple

on selecting a sub-network for a new task that reduces forgetting of past
tasks. However, this selection could limit the forward transfer of relevant
past knowledge that helps in future learning. Our study reveals that satisfying
both objectives jointly is more challenging when a unified classifier is used
for all classes of seen tasks-class-Incremental Learning (class-IL)-as it is
prone to ambiguities between classes across tasks. Moreover, the challenge
increases when the semantic similarity of classes across tasks increases. To
address this challenge, we propose a new CL method, named AFAF, that aims to
Avoid Forgetting and Allow Forward transfer in class-IL using fix-capacity
models. AFAF allocates a sub-network that enables selective transfer of
relevant knowledge to a new task while preserving past knowledge, reusing some
of the previously allocated components to utilize the fixed-capacity, and
addressing class-ambiguities when similarities exist. The experiments show the
effectiveness of AFAF in providing models with multiple CL desirable
properties, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods on various challenging
benchmarks with different semantic similarities.

high coupling gain, the group exhibits a collective emergent behavior which is
governed by a simple algebraic average of the node dynamics called the blended
dynamics. This finding has been utilized for designing heterogeneous
multi-agent systems by building the desired blended dynamics first and then
splitting it into the node dynamics. However, to compute the magnitude of the
coupling gain, each agent needs to know global information such as the number
of participating nodes, the graph structure, and so on, which prevents a fully
decentralized design of the node dynamics in conjunction with the coupling
laws. To resolve this issue, the idea of funnel control, which is a method for
adaptive gain selection, can be exploited for a node-wise coupling, but the
price to pay is that the collective emergent behavior is no longer governed by
a simple average of the node dynamics. Our analysis reveals that this drawback
can be avoided by an edge-wise design premise, which is the idea that we
present in this paper. After all, we gain benefits such as a fully
decentralized design without global information, collective emergent behavior
being governed by the blended dynamics, and the plug-and-play operation based
on edge-wise handshaking between two nodes.

parameters can be interpreted in terms of the model of the reflection of
emission from a small accretion column (the source's luminosity at the time of

encoder backbones to discriminate training samples without labels. While CNN

supervised learning, their network attention is under-explored for further
improvement. Motivated by the transformers that explore visual attention
effectively in recognition scenarios, we propose a CNN Attention REvitalization
(CARE) framework to train attentive CNN encoders guided by transformers in SSL.
The proposed CARE framework consists of a CNN stream (C-stream) and a
transformer stream (T-stream), where each stream contains two branches.
C-stream follows an existing SSL framework with two CNN encoders, two
projectors, and a predictor. T-stream contains two transformers, two
projectors, and a predictor. T-stream connects to CNN encoders and is in
parallel to the remaining C-Stream. During training, we perform SSL in both
streams simultaneously and use the T-stream output to supervise C-stream. The
features from CNN encoders are modulated in T-stream for visual attention
enhancement and become suitable for the SSL scenario. We use these modulated
features to supervise C-stream for learning attentive CNN encoders. To this
end, we revitalize CNN attention by using transformers as guidance. Experiments
on several standard visual recognition benchmarks, including image
classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, show that the
proposed CARE framework improves CNN encoder backbones to the state-of-the-art
performance.

autoregressive manner, i.e., generating descriptions word by word, which

applications. Non-autoregressive image captioning with continuous iterative
refinement, which eliminates the sequential dependence in a sentence
generation, can achieve comparable performance to the autoregressive
counterparts with a considerable acceleration. Nevertheless, based on a
well-designed experiment, we empirically proved that iteration times can be
effectively reduced when providing sufficient prior knowledge for the language
decoder. Towards that end, we propose a novel two-stage framework, referred to
as Semi-Autoregressive Image Captioning (SAIC), to make a better trade-off

property in global but relieves it in local. Specifically, SAIC model first
jumpily generates an intermittent sequence in an autoregressive manner, that
is, it predicts the first word in every word group in order. Then, with the
help of the partially deterministic prior information and image features, SAIC
model non-autoregressively fills all the skipped words with one iteration.

well, and we demonstrate that our model achieves an even better accuracy when
used in a transfer learning setting in which models trained on games with one

the riddle, observational data from the Planck mission point to a $3.4\sigma$
evidence for a closed universe, further challenging the $\Lambda$CDM
concordance model of cosmology. Recently, a direct-observational test has been
proposed to discriminate effects of the spatial curvature in the cosmological
model. The test is based on the fundamental distance--flux--redshift relation
of the luminosity distance modulus, $\Delta \mu$. We reexamine the outcomes of
this test and show that achieving the required $\Delta \mu$ sensitivity to
discriminate among cosmological models is materially far more challenging than
previously thought. Armed with supernova type Ia (SN Ia) data, calibrated using
Cepheid measured distances, we apply the test to archetypal spatially non-flat
models that ameliorate the $H_0$ tension and show that the $3\sigma$ contour of
$\Delta \mu$ predicted by these models overlaps the 68\% CL SN Ia residuals

performance in many language understanding tasks, they have been demonstrated
to inherit strong gender bias from its training data. Existing studies
addressing the gender bias issue of pre-trained models, usually recollect and
build gender-neutral data on their own and conduct a second phase pre-training
on the released pre-trained model with such data. However, given the limited
size of the gender-neutral data and its potential distributional mismatch with
the original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting would occur during the
second-phase pre-training. Forgetting on the original training data may damage
the model's downstream performance to a large margin. In this work, we first
empirically show that even if the gender-neutral data for second-phase
pre-training comes from the original training data, catastrophic forgetting
still occurs if the size of gender-neutral data is smaller than that of
original training data. Then, we propose a new method, GEnder Equality Prompt
(GEEP), to improve gender fairness of pre-trained models without forgetting.
GEEP learns gender-related prompts to reduce gender bias, conditioned on frozen
language models. Since all pre-trained parameters are frozen, forgetting on
information from the original training data can be alleviated to the most
extent. Then GEEP trains new embeddings of profession names as gender equality
prompts conditioned on the frozen model. Empirical results show that GEEP not
only achieves state-of-the-art performances on gender debiasing in various
applications such as pronoun predicting and coreference resolution, but also
achieves comparable results on general downstream tasks such as GLUE with
original pre-trained models without much forgetting.

analysis and by simulations that the proposed tests have higher power than the
standard rank-based tests, especially when the proportion of zeros in the data

the world. To mitigate this issue, many researchers have proposed automated
fact-checking methods to fight the spread of fake news. However, most methods
cannot explain the reasoning behind their decisions, failing to build trust
between machines and humans using such technology. Trust is essential for
fact-checking to be applied in the real world. Here, we address fact-checking
explainability through question answering. In particular, we propose generating
questions and answers from claims and answering the same questions from
evidence. We also propose an answer comparison model with an attention
mechanism attached to each question. Leveraging question answering as a proxy,
we break down automated fact-checking into several steps -- this separation
aids models' explainability as it allows for more detailed analysis of their
decision-making processes. Experimental results show that the proposed model
can achieve state-of-the-art performance while providing reasonable explainable
capabilities.

tasks. Numerous weighting schemes have been proposed. Some schemes take the
easy-first mode, whereas some others take the hard-first one. Naturally, an
interesting yet realistic question is raised. Which samples should be learned
first given a new learning task, easy or hard? To answer this question, both
theoretical analyses and experimental verification are conducted. First, a
general optimized objective function is proposed, revealing the relationship
between the difficulty distribution and the difficulty-based sample weights.
Second, on the basis of the optimized objective function, theoretical answers
are obtained. Besides the easy-first and hard-first modes, there are two other
priority modes, namely, medium-first and two-ends-first. The prior mode does
not necessarily remain unchanged during the training process. Third, an
effective and universal solution is proposed to select the optimal priority
mode when there is no prior knowledge or theoretical clues. The four modes,
namely, easy/medium/hard/two-ends-first, can be flexibly switched in the
proposed solution. Fourth, a wide range of experiments is conducted under
various scenarios to further compare the weighting schemes in different modes.
On the basis of these works, reasonable and comprehensive answers are obtained.
Factors including the distribution of samples' learning difficulties and the
validation data determine which samples should be learned first in a learning

natural structure humans use to organise information. In machine learning, the

relatively unexplored. Here we focus on how to integrate the hierarchical

problem, however it presents some issues like requiring the careful
construction of the triplets, and being limited in the extent of hierarchical
information it uses at each iteration. In this work we propose a rank based
loss function that uses hierarchical information and translates this into a
rank ordering of target distances between the examples. We show that rank based
loss is suitable to learn hierarchical representations of the data. By testing
on unseen fine level classes we show that this method is also capable of
learning hierarchically correct representations of the new classes. Rank based
loss has two promising aspects, it is generalisable to hierarchies with any
number of levels, and is capable of dealing with data with incomplete
hierarchical labels.

and now is expanding within some higher dimensional space. The elastic
substrate is built from tiny invisible constituents, called tetrons, with bond
length about the Planck length and binding energy the Planck energy. All
ordinary matter particles are quasiparticle excitations of the tetrons gliding
on the elastic medium. Since the quasiparticles fulfill Lorentz covariant wave
equations, they perceive the universe as a 3+1 dimensional spacetime continuum
lacking a preferred rest system. Any type of mass/energy induces curvature on
the spacetime continuum as determined by the Einstein equations. The 24 known
quarks and leptons arise as eigenmode excitations of a tetrahedral fiber
structure, which is made up from 4 tetrons and extends into 3 additional
dimensions. While the laws of gravity are due to the elastic properties of the
tetron bonds, particle physics interactions take place within the fibers. I
will concentrate on three of the most intriguing features of the model: (i)
Understanding small neutrino masses from the conservation of isospin, and, more
in general, calculating the spectrum of quark and lepton masses. This is
obtained from the tetron model's interpretation of the Higgs mechanism. As a
byproduct, the connection between the large top mass and the electroweak
symmetry breaking becomes apparent. (ii) The possibility to determine the full
size of the universe from future dark energy measurements. This is obtained
from the tetron model's interpretation of the dark energy effect. (iii)
Finally, the origin of the big bang `Hubble tension' within the tetron scheme
will be elucidated, and deviations from the standard picture such as a varying
Newton constant are discussed.

potential singularities in 3D Navier-Stokes flows based on the
Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin conditions. They assert that if the quantity
$\int_0^T \| \mathbf{u}(t) \|_{L^q(\Omega)}^p \, dt$, where $2/p+3/q \le 1$, $q
> 3$, is bounded, then the solution $\mathbf{u}(t)$ of the Navier-Stokes system
is smooth on the interval $[0,T]$. In other words, if a singularity should
occur at some time $t \in [0,T]$, then this quantity must be unbounded. We have
probed this condition by studying a family of variational PDE optimization
problems where initial conditions $\mathbf{u}_0$ are sought to maximize
$\int_0^T \| \mathbf{u}(t) \|_{L^4(\Omega)}^8 \, dt$ for different $T$ subject
to suitable constraints. These problems are solved numerically using a
large-scale adjoint-based gradient approach. Even in the flows corresponding to
the optimal initial conditions determined in this way no evidence has been
found for singularity formation, which would be manifested by unbounded growth
of $\| \mathbf{u}(t) \|_{L^4(\Omega)}$. However, the maximum enstrophy attained

technology to noninvasively analyze the heart's mechanical activity. Through
evaluating heart sounds, this technology has been chiefly leveraged as a
preliminary solution to automatically diagnose Cardiovascular diseases among
adults; however, prenatal tasks such as fetal gender identification have been
relatively less studied using fetal Phonocardiography (FPCG). In this work, we
apply common PCG signal processing techniques on the gender-tagged Shiraz
University Fetal Heart Sounds Database and study the applicability of
previously proposed features in classifying fetal gender using both Machine
Learning and Deep Learning models. Even though PCG data acquisition's
cost-effectiveness and feasibility make it a convenient method of Fetal Heart
Rate (FHR) monitoring, the contaminated nature of PCG signals with the noise of
various types makes it a challenging modality. To address this problem, we
experimented with both static and adaptive noise reduction techniques such as
Low-pass filtering, Denoising Autoencoders, and Source Separators. We apply a
wide range of previously proposed classifiers to our dataset and propose a
novel ensemble method of Fetal Gender Identification (FGI). Our method
substantially outperformed the baseline and reached up to 91% accuracy in

computational cost for applications like seismic imaging and full waveform
inversion. An alternative approach is to solve the frequency domain Helmholtz
equation, since it offers a reduction in dimensionality as it can be solved per
frequency. However, computational challenges with the classical Helmholtz
solvers such as the need to invert a large stiffness matrix can make these
approaches computationally infeasible for large 3D models or for modeling high
frequencies. Moreover, these methods do not have a mechanism to transfer
information gained from solving one problem to the next. This becomes a
bottleneck for applications like full waveform inversion where repeated
modeling is necessary. Therefore, recently a new approach based on the emerging
paradigm of physics informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed to solve
the Helmholtz equation. The method has shown promise in addressing several
challenging associated with the conventional algorithms, including flexibility
to model additional physics and the use of transfer learning to speed up
computations. However, the approach still needs further developments to be
fully practicable. Foremost amongst the challenges is the slow convergence
speed and reduced accuracy, especially in presence of sharp heterogeneities in
the velocity model. Therefore, with an eye on exploring how improved
convergence can be obtained for the PINN Helmholtz solvers, we study different
activation functions routinely used in the PINN literature, in addition to the
swish activation function - a variant of ReLU that has shown improved
performance on a number of data science problems. Through a comparative study,
we find that swish yields superior performance compared to the other activation
functions routinely used in the PINN literature.

flow structures, a two-stage fourth-order subcell finite volume (SCFV) method
combining the gas-kinetic solver (GKS) with subcell techniques for compressible
flows over (unstructured) triangular meshes was developed to improve the
compactness and efficiency. Compared to the fourth-order GKS-based traditional
finite volume (FV) method, the proposed method realizes compactness effectively
by subdividing each cell into a set of subcells or control volumes (CVs) and
selecting only face-neighboring cells for high-order compact reconstruction.
Because a set of CVs share a solution polynomial, the reconstruction is more
efficient than that for traditional FV-GKS, where each CV needs to be
separately reconstructed. Unlike in the single-stage third-order SCFV-GKS, both
accuracy and efficiency are improved significantly by two-stage fourth-order
temporal discretization, for which only a second-order gas distribution
function is needed to simplify the construction of the flux function and reduce
computational costs. For viscous flows, it is not necessary to compute the
viscous term with GKS. Compared to the fourth-stage Runge--Kutta method, one
half of the stage is saved for achieving fourth-order time accuracy, which also
helps to improve the efficiency. Therefore, a new high-order method with
compactness, efficiency, and robustness is proposed by combining the SCFV
method with the two-stage gas-kinetic flux. Several benchmark cases were tested
to demonstrate the performance of the method in compressible flow simulations.

Direct fiber-level numerical simulations can provide insights into the role of
the constitutive components of such networks, their morphology, and
arrangements on the strength of the products made of them. However, direct
mechanical simulation of randomly generated large and thin fiber networks is
characterized by overwhelming computational costs. Herein, a stochastic
constitutive model for predicting the random mechanical response of isotropic
thin fiber networks of arbitrary size is presented. The model is based on
stochastic volume elements (SVEs) with SVE size-specific deterministic and
stochastic constitutive law parameters. The randomness in the network is
described by the spatial fields of the uniaxial strain and strength to failure,
formulated using multivariate kernel functions and approximate univariate
probability density functions. The proposed stochastic continuum approach shows
good agreement when compared to direct numerical simulation with respect to
mechanical response. Furthermore, strain localization patterns matched the one
observed in direct simulations, which suggests an accurate prediction of the
failure location. This work demonstrates that the proposed stochastic
constitutive model can be used to predict the response of random isotropic

private, and is not directly subject to social monitoring. Nevertheless, social
interactions can affect private opinions and behaviours. This paper builds an
agent-based model of interactions between consumers heterogeneous in their
sociability, initial opinions and behaviours related to food waste and
willingness to consider different opinions, in order to assess how social
interactions can affect private behaviours. Compared to existing models of
opinion dynamics, we innovate by including a range of ``cognitive dissonance''
between stated opinions and actual behaviours that consumers are willing to
accept before changing one of the two. We calibrate the model using
questionnaire data on household food waste in Italy. We find that a limited
degree of mixing between different socio-demographic groups, namely adult and
young consumers, is enough to trigger change, but a certain openness of mind is
required from more wasteful individuals. Equally, a small group of
environmentally committed consumers can attract a sizeable share of the
population towards low-waste behaviours if they show a certain variability of
opinions and are willing to compromise with individuals in their close
neighbourhood in terms of opinions. These findings can help design effective
interventions to promote pro-environmental behaviours, taking advantage of the
beneficial network effects while anticipating negative externalities.

asymmetric price movements that have caused antitrust concerns in many
countries. We formalize four existing methods and propose six new methods based
on spectral analysis and machine learning. We evaluate their accuracy in
station-level gasoline-price data from Western Australia, New South Wales, and
Germany. Most methods achieve high accuracy in the first two, but only a few
can detect the nuanced cycles in the third. Results suggest whether researchers
find a positive or negative statistical relationship between cycles and
markups, and hence their implications for competition policy, crucially depends
on the choice of methods. We conclude with a set of practical recommendations.

  Reputation Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine-related Facebook Comments in the
  Philippines","Submitted to Applied Soft Computing",,,,"cs.CY cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vaccine hesitancy and other COVID-19-related concerns and complaints in the
Philippines are evident on social media. It is important to identify these
different topics and sentiments in order to gauge public opinion, use the
insights to develop policies, and make necessary adjustments or actions to
improve public image and reputation of the administering agency and the
COVID-19 vaccines themselves. This paper proposes a semi-supervised machine
learning pipeline to perform topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and an
analysis of vaccine brand reputation to obtain an in-depth understanding of
national public opinion of Filipinos on Facebook. The methodology makes use of
a multilingual version of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers or BERT for topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, five
different classifiers for sentiment analysis, and cosine similarity of BERT
topic embeddings for vaccine brand reputation analysis. Results suggest that
any type of COVID-19 misinformation is an emergent property of COVID-19 public
opinion, and that the detection of COVID-19 misinformation can be an
unsupervised task. Sentiment analysis aided by hierarchical clustering reveal
that 21 of the 25 topics extrapolated by topic modeling are negative topics.
Such negative comments spike in count whenever the Department of Health in the
Philippines posts about the COVID-19 situation in other countries.
Additionally, the high numbers of laugh reactions on the Facebook posts by the
same agency -- without any humorous content -- suggest that the reactors of
these posts tend to react the way they do, not because of what the posts are
about but because of who posted them.

  Code Analysis","22 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Model web services provide an approach for implementing and facilitating the
sharing of geographic models. The description and acquisition of inputs and
outputs (IO) of geographic models is a key issue in constructing and using
model web services. These approaches for describing and acquiring the data
formats of the IO of geographic models can be classified into two categories,
i.e., intermediate-data-format-based and native-data-format-based. Nonetheless,
these two categories mainly consider the description of the IO of geographical
models but relatively pay little attention to the acquisition. To address this
issue, this paper proposes an approach for automatically parsing data formats
of the IO utilizing the relationship between the IO and source codes. This
proposed approach can utilize such a strict and coupling relationship and the
expression form of the data formats in the source codes to retrospectively
derive the IO data format and automatically generate data format documentation.
The feasibility of the proposed approach has been verified via a geographical
model coded in the FORTRAN language, which shows that it significantly improves
the efficiency of writing data format specifications and promotes sharing
geographic models as model web services.
