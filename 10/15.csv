in the pressure of the early Universe plasma. For example, events in the
standard model of particle physics, such as the $W^\pm/Z^0$ decoupling, the
quark-hadron transition, the muon and pion becoming non-relativistic, and the
annihilation of electrons and positrons, cause a suppression in the Equation of
State parameter and leave peaks in the PBH mass function around
$10^{-6},\,2,\,60$, and $10^6\, M_\odot$, respectively, in the case of a nearly
scale-invariant primordial power spectrum. The superposition of unresolved
mergers of such PBHs results in a stochastic gravitational-wave background
(SGWB) that covers a wide range of frequencies and can be tested with future
gravitational wave (GW) detectors. In this paper, we discuss how its spectral
shape can be used to infer properties about inflation, the thermal history of
the Universe, and the dynamics of binary formation in dense halos encoded in
their merger rate formula. Although many of these physical effects are
degenerate within the sensitivity of a single detector, they can be
disentangled by the simultaneous observation of the SGWB at different
frequencies, highlighting the importance of multi-frequency observations of GWs
to characterize the physics of PBHs from the early to the late time Universe.

pessimistic predictions from classical perturbation theories, these methods can
perform reliably well if the generalized eigenvalue problem is solved using a

radiation therapy as a treatment verification tool. The aim of this work was to
discover the benefits of always-on Cherenkov images as a novel incident
detection and quality improvement system through retrospective review of
imaging in our center.
  Methods: Continuous imaging of all patients was attempted during a 12-month
period by automating the acquisition of Cherenkov imaging using an always-on
commercial system. Multi-camera systems were installed in two treatment bunkers
in the radiation oncology clinic at our center and one bunker in an affiliated
satellite clinic. Images were acquired as part of normal treatment procedure
and reviewed retrospectively with potential incidents flagged for evaluation by
the physician and medical physics teams.
  Results: In total, 622 patients were imaged as part of this study. In this
summary, 9 patients were identified with incidents occurring during their
course of treatment that were detected only with Cherenkov imaging. Incidents
were found relating to issues during simulation, planning, pre-treatment
review, and treatment delivery, however none of the incidents were detected
prior to treatment delivery. Primary areas of improvement identified in this
study are dose to unintended areas in planning, dose to unintended areas due to
positioning, and non-ideal bolus placement during setup. Case studies are
presented highlighting the detection of these issues using Cherenkov imaging.
  Conclusions: All detected events were deemed below the threshold for
reporting, but their observation could lead to quality improvement in practice.
Perhaps most importantly, the imaging was seamless with no effort required by
the radiotherapy team and provided both real-time and permanent records of what
was delivered in each fraction.

recorded $p$$+$$p$, $p$$+$Al, and $p$$+$Au collision data at center of mass
energies of $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV with the proton beam(s) transversely
polarized. At very forward rapidities $\eta>6.8$ relative to the polarized
proton beam, neutrons were detected either inclusively or in (anti)correlation
with detector activity related to hard collisions. The resulting single spin
asymmetries, that were previously reported, have now been extracted as a
function of the transverse momentum of the neutron as well as its longitudinal
momentum fraction $x_F$. The explicit kinematic dependence, combined with the
correlation information allows for a closer look at the interplay of different
mechanisms suggested to describe these asymmetries, such as hadronic
interactions or electromagnetic interactions in ultra-peripheral collisions,
UPC. Events that are correlated with a hard collision indeed display a mostly
negative asymmetry that increases in magnitude as a function of transverse
momentum with only little dependence on $x_F$. In contrast, events that are not
likely to have emerged from a hard collision display positive asymmetries for
the nuclear collisions with a kinematic dependence that resembles that of a UPC
based model. Because the UPC interaction depends strongly on the charge of the
nucleus, those effects are very small for $p$$+$$p$ collisions, moderate for
$p$$+$Al collisions, and large for $p$$+$Au collisions.

for AHEAD so that the overall utility can be consistently competitive while
rigorously satisfying LDP. Leveraging multiple real and synthetic datasets, we

quantum network, composed of a randomly coupled set of two-level systems, as a
processing device for phase measurement. An incoming resource state carrying
the phase information interacts with the quantum network, whose emission is
trained to produce a desired output signal. We demonstrate phase precision
scaling following the standard quantum limit, the Heisenberg limit, and beyond.
This can be achieved using quantum resource states such as NOON states or other
entangled states, however, we also find that classically correlated mixtures of
states are alone sufficient, provided that they exhibit quantum coherence. Our
proposed setup does not require conditional measurements, and is compatible
with many different types of coupling between the quantum network and the phase
encoding state, hence making it attractive to a wide range of possible physical
implementations.

the solution growth of large single crystals of Ag$_8$SnS$_6$ of mass up to 1 g
from a ternary Ag-Sn-S melt. On cooling from high temperature, Ag$_8$SnS$_6$
undergoes a known cubic (F-43m) to orthorhombic (Pna2$_1$) phase transition at
$\approx$ 460 K. By studying the magnetization and thermal expansion between
5-300 K, we discover a second structural transition at $\approx$ 120 K. Single

orthorhombic structure with space group Pmn2$_1$ (a = 7.6629(5) \AA, b =

Ag$_8$GeSe$_6$. The 120 K transition is first-order and has a large thermal

rapidly cooling to temperatures below 40 K. We lastly compare the room and low

performance of gaseous substance recognition, calling for an antidrift domain
adaptation algorithm. However, the prerequisite for traditional methods to
achieve fine results is to have data from both nondrift distributions (source
domain) and drift distributions (target domain) for domain alignment, which is
usually unrealistic and unachievable in real-life scenarios. To compensate for
this, in this paper, deep learning based on a target-domain-free domain
adaptation convolutional neural network (TDACNN) is proposed. The main concept
is that CNNs extract not only the domain-specific features of samples but also
the domain-invariant features underlying both the source and target domains.
Making full use of these various levels of embedding features can lead to
comprehensive utilization of different levels of characteristics, thus
achieving drift compensation by the extracted intermediate features between two
domains. In the TDACNN, a flexible multibranch backbone with a multiclassifier
structure is proposed under the guidance of bionics, which utilizes multiple
embedding features comprehensively without involving target domain data during
training. A classifier ensemble method based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)
is proposed to evaluate all the classifiers jointly based on the credibility of
the pseudolabel. To optimize network training, an additive angular margin
softmax loss with parameter dynamic adjustment is utilized. Experiments on two
drift datasets under different settings demonstrate the superiority of TDACNN
compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

transferability respectively. Omni-Net further coordinates the parallel flows
by routing their representations via the joint-flow, enabling knowledge
transfer across flows. Our second contribution is the Omni-Loss, which
introduces a self-distillation strategy separately on the pre-training and
meta-training objectives for boosting knowledge transfer throughout different
training stages. Omni-Training is a general framework to accommodate many
existing algorithms. Evaluations justify that our single framework consistently

  Processing",,"10.1109/TIP.2022.3216772",,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted more and more
attention since it only uses image-level labels and can save huge annotation
costs. Most of the WSOD methods use Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) as their
basic framework, which regard it as an instance classification problem.
However, these methods based on MIL tends to converge only on the most
discriminate regions of different instances, rather than their corresponding
complete regions, that is, insufficient integrity. Inspired by the habit of
observing things by the human, we propose a new method by comparing the initial
proposals and the extension ones to optimize those initial proposals.
Specifically, we propose one new strategy for WSOD by involving contrastive
proposal extension (CPE), which consists of multiple directional contrastive
proposal extensions (D-CPE), and each D-CPE contains encoders based on LSTM
network and corresponding decoders. Firstly, the boundary of initial proposals
in MIL is extended to different positions according to well-designed sequential
order. Then, CPE compares the extended proposal and the initial proposal by
extracting the feature semantics of them using the encoders, and calculates the
integrity of the initial proposal to optimize the score of the initial
proposal. These contrastive contextual semantics will guide the basic WSOD to
suppress bad proposals and improve the scores of good ones. In addition, a
simple two-stream network is designed as the decoder to constrain the temporal
coding of LSTM and improve the performance of WSOD further. Experiments on
PASCAL VOC 2007, VOC 2012 and MS-COCO datasets show that our method has
achieved the state-of-the-art results.

and antithyroglobulin autoantibodies, which are important surrogates of
treatment response. The model is presented in two flavours: on the one hand, as
a deterministic continuous model, which is useful to fit populational data, and
on the other hand, as a stochastic Markov model, which is particularly useful
to investigate tumor control probabilities and treatment individualization. The
model was used to fit the response dynamics (tumor/thyroid volumes,
thyroglobulin and antithyroglobulin autoantibodies) observed in experimental
studies of thyroid cancer and Graves' disease treated with I-131-radiotherapy.
A qualitative adequate fitting of the model to the experimental data was
achieved. We also used the model to investigate treatment individualization
strategies for differentiated thyroid cancer, aiming to improve the tumor

the absorbed dose in the tumor and tumor radiosensitivity (which are both
magnitudes that can potentially be individually determined for every patient)

traditionally formulated using only continuous variables. Typically, control
devices with discrete-valued settings, which provide valuable flexibility to
the network and improve resilience, are omitted from AC-OPF formulations due to
the difficulty of integrality constraints. We propose a two-stage homotopy
algorithm to solve the AC-OPF problem with discrete-valued control settings.
This method does not rely on prior knowledge of control settings or other
initial conditions. The first stage relaxes the discrete settings to continuous
variables and solves the optimization using a robust homotopy technique. Once
the solution has been obtained using relaxed models, second homotopy problem
gradually transforms the relaxed settings to their nearest feasible discrete
values. We test the proposed algorithm on several large networks with switched
shunts and adjustable transformers and show it can outperform a similar
state-of-the-art solver.

microdroplets produced via pneumatic spraying or capillary condensation have
garnered significant attention. How covalent bonds in water could break under
such conditions challenges our textbook understanding of physical chemistry and
the water substance. While there is no definitive answer, it has been
speculated that ultrahigh electric fields at the air-water interface are
responsible for this chemical transformation. Here, we resolve this mystery via
a comprehensive experimental investigation of H$_2$O$_2$ formation in (i) water
microdroplets sprayed over a range of liquid flow-rates, the (shearing) air
flow rates, and the air composition (ii) water microdroplets condensed on
hydrophobic substrates formed via hot water or humidifier under controlled air
composition. Specifically, we assessed the contributions of the evaporative
concentration and shock waves in sprays and the effects of trace O$_3$(g) on
the H$_2$O$_2$ formation. Glovebox experiments revealed that the H$_2$O$_2$
formation in water microdroplets was most sensitive to the air-borne ozone
(O$_3$) concentration. In the absence of O$_3$(g), we could not detect
H$_2$O$_2$(aq) in sprays or condensates (detection limit: 250 nM. In contrast,
microdroplets exposed to atmospherically relevant O$_3$(g) concentration
(10-100 ppb) formed 2-30 $\mu$M H$_2$O$_2$(aq); increasing the gas-liquid
surface area, mixing, and contact duration increased H$_2$O$_2$(aq)
concentration. Thus, the mystery is resolved - the water surface facilitates
the O$_3$(g) mass transfer, which is followed by the chemical transformation of
O$_3$(aq) into H$_2$O$_2$(aq). These findings should also help us understand
the implications of this chemistry in natural and applied contexts.

color-octet channels that are suppressed at most by a factor $v^4$ in the
velocity parameter $v$ relative to the leading color-singlet channel. We put
forward factorized expressions for the helicity structure functions in terms of

are valid when the $J/\psi$ transverse momentum is small with respect to the

determine the perturbative tails of the shape functions and find them to be
independent of the $J/\psi$ polarization. In particular, we focus on the $\cos
2\phi$ azimuthal decay asymmetry, which originates from the distribution of
linearly polarized gluons inside an unpolarized proton. We therefore suggest a
novel experiment for the extraction of this so-far unknown parton density that

molecules has been limited by their thermostability, which is fundamentally
limited by the intrinsic instability of RNA molecules to a chemical degradation
reaction called in-line hydrolysis. Predicting the degradation of an RNA
molecule is a key task in designing more stable RNA-based therapeutics. Here,
we describe a crowdsourced machine learning competition (""Stanford

6043 102-130-nucleotide diverse RNA constructs that were themselves solicited
through crowdsourcing on the RNA design platform Eterna. The entire experiment
was completed in less than 6 months, and 41% of nucleotide-level predictions
from the winning model were within experimental error of the ground truth
measurement. Furthermore, these models generalized to blindly predicting
orthogonal degradation data on much longer mRNA molecules (504-1588
nucleotides) with improved accuracy compared to previously published models.
Top teams integrated natural language processing architectures and data
augmentation techniques with predictions from previous dynamic programming
models for RNA secondary structure. These results indicate that such models are
capable of representing in-line hydrolysis with excellent accuracy, supporting
their use for designing stabilized messenger RNAs. The integration of two

learning, may be fruitful for other urgent problems that demand scientific
discovery on rapid timescales.

large-conductance peaks without very extensive fine-tuning, we propose an
alternative mechanism through direct theoretical simulations that can explain
the large zero-bias conductance peaks being generated on-demand in the
nontopological regime in Majorana nanowires by satisfying the following three
sufficient conditions: (i) strong potential disorder in the bulk of the
nanowire, suppressing the topological regime; (ii) strong suppression of the
disorder near the nanowire ends connecting to the tunneling leads, perhaps
because of screening by the metallic leads and gates; and (iii) low tunnel
barrier strength leading to large tunneling amplitude. The third condition is
typically achieved experimentally by fine-tuning the tunnel barrier and the
first condition is generic in all existing nanowires by virtue of considerable
sample disorder induced by unintentional random quenched charged impurities.
The second condition is likely to apply to many samples since the disorder
potential would be typically screened more strongly at the wire ends because of
the large metallic tunnel pads used experimentally. We show that the resultant
tunneling conductance manifests large trivial zero-bias peaks almost on demand,
and such peaks could be $\sim 2e^2/h$, when appropriately fine-tuned by the
tunnel barrier strength and the temperature, as reported experimentally. Our
work not only solves the mystery in recent experiments that the observations of
the large zero-bias conductance peaks are generic by proposing a theoretically
possible mechanism but also explains why these hypothesized conditions are
naturally satisfied in experiments.

that the performance of state-of-the-art models nowadays was severely hampered

common degradations, we also consider adversarial noises, which alter the model

between volatile and non-volatile memory in intermittent computing.
Mixed-volatile microcontrollers allow programmers to allocate part of the
application state onto non-volatile main memory. Programmers are therefore to
explore manually the trade-off between simpler management of persistent state
against the energy overhead for non-volatile memory operations and
intermittence anomalies due to re-execution of non-idempotent code. This
approach is laborious and yields sub-optimal performance. We take a different
stand with ALFRED: we provide programmers with a virtual memory abstraction
detached from the specific volatile nature of memory and automatically
determine an efficient mapping from virtual to volatile or non-volatile memory.
Unlike existing works, ALFRED does not require programmers to learn a new
programming model or language syntax, while the mapping is entirely resolved at
compile-time, reducing the run-time energy overhead. We implement ALFRED
through a series of program machine-level code transformations. Compared to
existing systems, we demonstrate that ALFRED reduces energy consumption by up
to two orders of magnitude given a fixed workload. This enables the workloads
to finish sooner, as the use of available energy shifts from ensuring forward
progress to useful application processing.

celebrated spirals introduced by Prandtl (Vortr\""age aus dem Gebiete der Hydro-

for each such spiral the normal component of the velocity field remains
continuous across the spiral. We give sufficient conditions for spiral vortex
sheets to be weak solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equations. Namely,
we show that a spiral gives rise to such a solution if and only if two
conditions hold across every spiral: a velocity matching condition and a
pressure matching condition. Furthermore we show that these two conditions are
equivalent to the imaginary part and the real part, respectively, of a single
complex constraint on the coefficients of the spirals. This in particular
provides a rigorous mathematical framework for logarithmic spirals, an issue
that has remained open since their introduction by Prandtl in 1922. Another
consequence of the main result is well-posedness of the symmetric Alexander
spiral with two branches, despite recent evidence for the contrary. Moreover,
our result implies a sharpness result of Delort's theorem on global existence
of solutions to the Euler equations with initial vorticity measure. Our main
tools are new explicit formulas for the velocity field and for the pressure
function, as well as a notion of a \emph{winding number} of a spiral, which not
only gives a robust way of localizing the spirals' arms with respect to a given

resonators. This leads to OAM bandgaps and non-Hermitian exceptional points
near the Brillouin-zone center and boundaries, which together give rise to
significantly enhanced helical dichroism. The underlying physics can be well
captured by an effective Hamiltonian that quantitatively reproduces the complex

scheme is proposed to cluster similar sequences which can handle temporal
variation and uncertainty in the data, and (3) exploit an exemplar-based
clustering mechanism and fine-tune its parameters to output minimum number of
clusters with given permissible distance constraints and without knowing the
number of modes present in the data. Then, the average of all sequences in a
cluster is considered as a human behavior pattern. Empirical studies on two
real-world datasets and a simulated dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
MTpattern with respect to internal and external measures of clustering.

for extremely short mitigation time scales. The method uses an array of small
hypervelocity kinetic penetrators that pulverize and disassemble an asteroid or
small comet. This mitigates the threat using the Earth's atmosphere to
dissipate the energy in the fragment cloud. The system allows a planetary
defense solution using existing technologies. This approach will work in
extended time scale modes where there is a large warning time, as well as in
short interdiction time scenarios with intercepts of minutes to days before
impact. In longer time intercept scenarios, the disassembled asteroid fragments
largely miss the Earth. In short intercept scenarios, the asteroid fragments of
maximum $\sim$10-meter diameter allow the Earth's atmosphere to act as a ""beam
dump"" where the fragments burn up and/or air burst, with the primary channel of
energy going into spatially and temporally de-correlated shock waves. It is the
de-correlated blast waves that are the key to why PI works so well. The
effectiveness of the approach depends on the intercept time and size of the
asteroid, but allows for effective defense against asteroids in the 20-1000m
diameter class and could virtually eliminate the threat of mass destruction
posed by these threats with very short warning times, though longer warning is
always preferred. A 20m diameter asteroid ($\sim$0.5Mt, similar to Chelyabinsk)
can be mitigated with a 100s prior to impact intercept with a 10m/s disruption.
With ~1m/s internal disruption, a 5 hours prior to impact intercept of a 50m
diameter asteroid ($\sim$10Mt yield, similar to Tunguska), a 1 day prior to
impact intercept of 100m diameter asteroid ($\sim$100Mt yield), or a 10-20 day
prior to impact intercept of Apophis ($\sim$370m diameter, $\sim$4Gt yield)
would mitigate these threats.

become the mainstream approach for transfer learning. To increase its
efficiency and prevent catastrophic forgetting and interference, techniques
like adapters and sparse fine-tuning have been developed. Adapters are modular,
as they can be combined to adapt a model towards different facets of knowledge
(e.g., dedicated language and/or task adapters). Sparse fine-tuning is
expressive, as it controls the behavior of all model components. In this work,
we introduce a new fine-tuning method with both these desirable properties. In
particular, we learn sparse, real-valued masks based on a simple variant of the
Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. Task-specific masks are obtained from annotated data
in a source language, and language-specific masks from masked language modeling
in a target language. Both these masks can then be composed with the pretrained
model. Unlike adapter-based fine-tuning, this method neither increases the
number of parameters at inference time nor alters the original model

Proposals to combine microwave-frequency mechanical resonators with
superconducting devices suggest the possibility of powerful quantum acoustic
processors. Meanwhile, experiments in several mechanical systems have
demonstrated quantum state control and readout, phonon number resolution, and
phonon-mediated qubit-qubit interactions. Currently, these acoustic platforms
lack processors capable of controlling multiple mechanical oscillators' quantum
states with a single qubit, and the rapid quantum non-demolition measurements
of mechanical states needed for error correction. Here we use a superconducting
qubit to control and read out the quantum state of a pair of nanomechanical
resonators. Our device is capable of fast qubit-mechanics swap operations,
which we use to deterministically manipulate the mechanical states. By placing
the qubit into the strong dispersive regime with both mechanical resonators
simultaneously, we determine the resonators' phonon number distributions via
Ramsey measurements. Finally, we present quantum tomography of the prepared
nonclassical and entangled mechanical states. Our result represents a concrete

communication technology, forming a Federated Edge Learning (FEEL), has spawned
a series of next-generation intelligent applications. However, due to the
openness of network connections, the FEEL framework generally involves hundreds
of remote devices (or clients), resulting in expensive communication costs,
which is not friendly to resource-constrained FEEL. To address this issue, we
propose a distributed approximate Newton-type algorithm with fast convergence
speed to alleviate the problem of FEEL resource (in terms of communication
resources) constraints. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is improved based
on distributed L-BFGS algorithm and allows each client to approximate the
high-cost Hessian matrix by computing the low-cost Fisher matrix in a
distributed manner to find a ""better"" descent direction, thereby speeding up
convergence. Second, we prove that the proposed algorithm has linear
convergence in strongly convex and non-convex cases and analyze its
computational and communication complexity. Similarly, due to the heterogeneity
of the connected remote devices, FEEL faces the challenge of heterogeneous data
and non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To this end, we
design a simple but elegant training scheme, namely FedOVA, to solve the
heterogeneous statistical challenge brought by heterogeneous data. In this way,
FedOVA first decomposes a multi-class classification problem into more
straightforward binary classification problems and then combines their
respective outputs using ensemble learning. In particular, the scheme can be
well integrated with our communication efficient algorithm to serve FEEL.
Numerical results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
algorithm.

debated questions in humanity, let alone for AI. Existing AI systems deployed
to millions of users, however, are already making decisions loaded with moral
implications, which poses a seemingly impossible challenge: teaching machines
moral sense, while humanity continues to grapple with it.
  To explore this challenge, we introduce Delphi, an experimental framework
based on deep neural networks trained directly to reason about descriptive
ethical judgments, e.g., ""helping a friend"" is generally good, while ""helping a
friend spread fake news"" is not. Empirical results shed novel insights on the
promises and limits of machine ethics; Delphi demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities in the face of novel ethical situations, while
off-the-shelf neural network models exhibit markedly poor judgment including
unjust biases, confirming the need for explicitly teaching machines moral
sense.
  Yet, Delphi is not perfect, exhibiting susceptibility to pervasive biases and
inconsistencies. Despite that, we demonstrate positive use cases of imperfect
Delphi, including using it as a component model within other imperfect AI
systems. Importantly, we interpret the operationalization of Delphi in light of
prominent ethical theories, which leads us to important future research

alleviate the concerns, we propose and study the problem of graph condensation
for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we aim to condense the large,
original graph into a small, synthetic and highly-informative graph, such that
GNNs trained on the small graph and large graph have comparable performance. We
approach the condensation problem by imitating the GNN training trajectory on
the original graph through the optimization of a gradient matching loss and
design a strategy to condense node futures and structural information
simultaneously. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of
the proposed framework in condensing different graph datasets into informative
smaller graphs. In particular, we are able to approximate the original test
accuracy by 95.3% on Reddit, 99.8% on Flickr and 99.0% on Citeseer, while
reducing their graph size by more than 99.9%, and the condensed graphs can be

We study the estimation of the Kronecker factors of the covariance matrix in
the matrix and tensor models. We show nonasymptotic bounds for the error
achieved by the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in several natural metrics.
In contrast to existing bounds, our results do not rely on the factors being
well-conditioned or sparse. For the matrix normal model, all our bounds are
minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, and for the tensor normal model our
bound for the largest factor and overall covariance matrix are minimax optimal
up to constant factors provided there are enough samples for any estimator to
obtain constant Frobenius error. In the same regimes as our sample complexity
bounds, we show that an iterative procedure to compute the MLE known as the
flip-flop algorithm converges linearly with high probability. Our main tool is
geodesic strong convexity in the geometry on positive-definite matrices induced
by the Fisher information metric. This strong convexity is determined by the
expansion of certain random quantum channels. We also provide numerical
evidence that combining the flip-flop algorithm with a simple shrinkage

acquiring velocity map is extremely expensive, making it impractical to scale
up a supervised approach to train the mapping from seismic data to velocity

integrating PDE and CNN in a loop, thus shifting the paradigm to unsupervised
learning that only requires seismic data. In particular, we use finite
difference to approximate the forward modeling of PDE as a differentiable
operator (from velocity map to seismic data) and model its inversion by CNN
(from seismic data to velocity map). Hence, we transform the supervised
inversion task into an unsupervised seismic data reconstruction task. We also
introduce a new large-scale dataset OpenFWI, to establish a more challenging
benchmark for the community. Experiment results show that our model (using
seismic data alone) yields comparable accuracy to the supervised counterpart

Our approach first extracts a set of features combining human intuition about

predict whether the base model was correct or not. We experiment with our
method on two tasks, extractive question answering and natural language

that explanations are useful for calibrating these models, boosting accuracy
when predictions do not have to be returned on every example. We further show

this work, we obtain massive human sequences by playing the video game with
automatically annotated 3D ground truths. Specifically, we contribute
GTA-Human, a large-scale 3D human dataset generated with the GTA-V game engine,
featuring a highly diverse set of subjects, actions, and scenarios. More
importantly, we study the use of game-playing data and obtain five major
insights. First, game-playing data is surprisingly effective. A simple
frame-based baseline trained on GTA-Human outperforms more sophisticated
methods by a large margin. For video-based methods, GTA-Human is even on par
with the in-domain training set. Second, we discover that synthetic data
provides critical complements to the real data that is typically collected
indoor. Our investigation into domain gap provides explanations for our data
mixture strategies that are simple yet useful. Third, the scale of the dataset
matters. The performance boost is closely related to the additional data
available. A systematic study reveals the model sensitivity to data density
from multiple key aspects. Fourth, the effectiveness of GTA-Human is also
attributed to the rich collection of strong supervision labels (SMPL
parameters), which are otherwise expensive to acquire in real datasets. Fifth,
the benefits of synthetic data extend to larger models such as deeper
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, for which a significant
impact is also observed. We hope our work could pave the way for scaling up 3D

study star formation and its effect on the physical properties of the
interstellar medium. We measure the specific star-formation rate (sSFR) and
find it to increase from $\rm10^{-10} yr^{-1}$ in the inner disk to
$\rm>10^{-8} yr^{-1}$ in the extended disk. This provides evidence for
inside-out disk growth. If these sSFRs are maintained, the XUV disk stellar
mass can double in $\sim$0.5 Gyr, suggesting a burst of star formation. The XUV
disk will continue forming stars for a long time due to the high gas depletion
times ($\tau_{dep}$). The stellar complexes in the XUV disk have
high-$\Sigma_{HI}$ and low-$\Sigma_{SFR}$ with $\tau_{dep}\sim$10 Gyrs, marking
the onset of a deviation from the traditional Kennicutt-Schmidt law. We find
that both far-ultraviolet (FUV) and a combination of FUV and 24$\mu$m
effectively trace star formation in the XUV disk. H$\alpha$ is weaker in
general and prone to stochasticities in the formation of massive stars.
Investigation of the circumgalactic medium at 29.5 kpc resulted in the
detection of two absorbing systems with metal-line species: the stronger
absorption component is consistent with gas flows around the disk, most likely
tracing inflow, while the weaker component is likely tracing corotating

theoretical studies have suggested that an effective two-band Hubbard model
with Ni 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and rare-earth ($R$) 5$d$ character may describe the
low-energy physics. Here, we study the ground state properties of this two-band
model on four-leg cylinders using the density-matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) technique to better grasp whether such a simple model can embody the
essential physics. A key difference compared to single-band Hubbard materials
is that the system is self-doped: even at overall half-filling, the $R$-band
acts as an electron reservoir, hole-doping the Ni-layer and fundamentally
altering the physics expected from an undoped antiferromagnet. On the four-leg
cylinder, the ground state is consistent with a Luttinger liquid, with
anti-phase modulations of the charge density in the Ni- and $R$-layers having
corresponding wavevectors that lock together. Light hole doping away from 1/2
filling releases the locking between the Ni and the $R$ charge modulations, as
the electron density in the $R$-band decreases and eventually becomes exhausted
at a hole doping concentration that depends sensitively on the effective
splitting between the Ni and the $R$ orbitals. The ground state of the doped
system is consistent with a Luther-Emery liquid, possessing quasi-long-range
superconducting correlations in the Ni layer, similar to the single-band
Hubbard model. Our results are consistent with experimental observations and
may help to reveal the microscopic mechanism for pairing and other emergent

commonly adopted dimensions of 256 and 768 offer sufficient performance on many
tasks, it is many times unclear whether the default dimension is the most
suitable choice for the subsequent downstream learning tasks. Furthermore,
representation dimensions are seldom subject to hyperparameter tuning due to
computational constraints. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a
surprisingly simple and efficient recursive compression procedure can be
sufficient to both significantly compress the initial representation, but also
potentially improve its performance when considering the task of text
classification. Having smaller and less noisy representations is the desired
property during deployment, as orders of magnitude smaller models can
significantly reduce the computational overload and with it the deployment
costs. We propose CoRe, a straightforward, representation learner-agnostic
framework suitable for representation compression. The CoRe's performance is
showcased and studied on a collection of 17 real-life corpora from biomedical,

Hamiltonians pivoting between the trivial and SPT phase opens up two new
directions which we explore here. (i) Since SPT Hamiltonians and entanglers are
now on the same footing, can we iterate this process to create other
interesting states? (ii) Since entanglers are known to arise as discrete
symmetries at SPT transitions, under what conditions can this be enhanced to
$U(1)$ 'pivot' symmetry generated by $H_{piv}$? In this work we explore both of
these questions. With regard to the first, we give examples of a rich web of
dualities obtained by iteratively using an SPT model as a pivot to generate the
next one. For the second question, we derive a simple criterion guaranteeing
that the direct interpolation between the trivial and SPT Hamiltonian has a
$U(1)$ pivot symmetry. We illustrate this in a variety of examples, assuming
various forms for $H_{piv}$, including the Ising chain, and the toric code
Hamiltonian. A remarkable property of such a $U(1)$ pivot symmetry is that it
shares a mutual anomaly with the symmetry protecting the nearby SPT phase. We
discuss how such anomalous and non-onsite $U(1)$ symmetries explain the exotic
phase diagrams that can appear, including an SPT multicritical point where the
gapless ground state is given by the fixed-point toric code state.

applications such as autonomous driving and AR/VR. These applications interact
with people in real-time on edge devices and thus require low latency and low
energy. Compared to projecting the point cloud to 2D space, directly processing
the 3D point cloud yields higher accuracy and lower #MACs. However, the
extremely sparse nature of point cloud poses challenges to hardware
acceleration. For example, we need to explicitly determine the nonzero outputs
and search for the nonzero neighbors (mapping operation), which is unsupported
in existing accelerators. Furthermore, explicit gather and scatter of sparse
features are required, resulting in large data movement overhead. In this
paper, we comprehensively analyze the performance bottleneck of modern point
cloud networks on CPU/GPU/TPU. To address the challenges, we then present
PointAcc, a novel point cloud deep learning accelerator. PointAcc maps diverse
mapping operations onto one versatile ranking-based kernel, streams the sparse
computation with configurable caching, and temporally fuses consecutive dense
layers to reduce the memory footprint. Evaluated on 8 point cloud models across
4 applications, PointAcc achieves 3.7X speedup and 22X energy savings over RTX
2080Ti GPU. Co-designed with light-weight neural networks, PointAcc rivals the
prior accelerator Mesorasi by 100X speedup with 9.1% higher accuracy running
segmentation on the S3DIS dataset. PointAcc paves the way for efficient point

pollution with planetary material but the accretion process remains poorly
understood. The main aim of this paper is to produce a road-map illustrating
several potential routes for white dwarf pollution and to link these paths to
observational outcomes. Our proposed main road begins with the tidal disruption
of a scattered asteroid and the formation of a highly eccentric tidal disc with
a wide range of fragment sizes. Accretion of these fragments by
Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag alone is too slow to explain the observed rates.
Instead, in the second stage, several processes including differential apsidal
precession cause high-velocity collisions between the eccentric fragments.
Large asteroids produce more fragments when they disrupt, causing rapid
grind-down and generating short and intense bursts of dust production, whereas
smaller asteroids grind down over longer periods of time. In the final stage,
the collisionally produced dust circularises and accretes onto the white dwarf
via drag forces. We show that optically thin dust accretion by PR drag produces
large infrared (IR) excesses when the accretion rate exceeds 10^7 g/s. We
hypothesise that around white dwarfs accreting at a high rate, but with no
detected infrared excess, dust circularisation requires enhanced drag - for
instance due to the presence of gas near the disc's pericentre.

majority of real-world scenes are composed of well-defined surfaces, we
introduce a surface analog of such implicit models called Neural Reflectance

that is diffeomorphic to a sphere, guaranteeing water-tight reconstructions.
Even more importantly, surface parameterizations allow NeRS to learn (neural)
bidirectional surface reflectance functions (BRDFs) that factorize
view-dependent appearance into environmental illumination, diffuse color

that surface-based neural reconstructions enable learning from such data,

detection from face videos. Methods: Face videos, electrocardiography (ECG),
and contact photoplethysmography (PPG) from 100 healthy subjects and 100 AF
patients are recorded. Data recordings from healthy subjects are all labeled as
healthy. Two cardiologists evaluated ECG recordings of patients and labeled
each recording as AF, sinus rhythm (SR), or atrial flutter (AFL). We use the 3D
convolutional neural network for remote PPG monitoring and propose a novel loss
function (Wasserstein distance) to use the timing of systolic peaks from
contact PPG as the label for our model training. Then a set of heart rate
variability (HRV) features are calculated from the inter-beat intervals, and a
support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained with HRV features. Results:
Our proposed method can accurately extract systolic peaks from face videos for
AF detection. The proposed method is trained with subject-independent 10-fold
cross-validation with 30s video clips and tested on two tasks. 1)
Classification of healthy versus AF: the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
are 96.00%, 95.36%, and 96.12%. 2) Classification of SR versus AF: the
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 95.23%, 98.53%, and 91.12%. In
addition, we also demonstrate the feasibility of non-contact AFL detection.
Conclusion: We achieve good performance of non-contact AF detection by learning
systolic peaks. Significance: non-contact AF detection can be used for
self-screening of AF symptoms for suspectable populations at home or
self-monitoring of AF recurrence after treatment for chronic patients.

increasing redshift: from ~30% at z ~ 0.7 to ~50% at z ~ 1.7. Using abundance

fractional mass contribution of clumps toward their total mass budget. Clumps

first concrete realisation of such ""non-local CFTs"", through a detailed
analysis of their classical and quantum symmetry algebra. Classically, the
symmetries consist of an infinite set of left-moving conformal and affine
$U(1)$ transformations that generate a Witt-Kac-Moody algebra, as well as a set
of non-local, field-dependent generalizations of right-moving conformal and
affine $U(1)$ transformations, whose algebra depends on the chosen basis.
Notably, there exists a basis, denoted as the ""flowed"" representation, in which
the right-moving charge algebra is simply Witt-Kac-Moody. At the quantum level,
we provide a concrete prescription for constructing the symmetry generators via
a combination of the flow equations they satisfy and the Sugawara construction,
and use this to explicitly resolve the ordering ambiguities and the quantum
corrections to the generators up to second order in the $J\bar T$ coupling
parameter. This construction naturally produces the ""flowed"" generators, whose
algebra is Virasoro-Kac-Moody to all orders in the coupling, with the same
central extension as that of the undeformed CFT. We use this input to work out
the quantum modifications to the ""unflowed"" generator algebra. A peculiarity of
the Virasoro generators we study is that their zero mode does not equal the
Hamiltonian, but is a quadratic function of it; this helps reconcile the
Virasoro symmetry with the non-locality of the model. We argue that also $T\bar
T$-deformed CFTs posses Virasoro symmetry, and discuss the existence of such a
symmetry in more general non-local QFTs.

degenerate problems of parameter-space approximate inference concerning the
high number of parameters and their strong dependencies in large models. For
this, previous works in the literature have attempted to employ IPs both to set
up the prior and to approximate the resulting posterior. However, this has
proven to be a challenging task. Existing methods that can tune the prior IP
result in a Gaussian predictive distribution, which fails to capture important
data patterns. By contrast, methods producing flexible predictive distributions
by using another IP to approximate the posterior process cannot tune the prior
IP to the observed data. We propose here the first method that can accomplish
both goals. For this, we rely on an inducing-point representation of the prior

\sigma$ discovery of CP violation in the charm system, leading to the new world
average $\Delta a_{CP}^{\mathrm{dir}} = -0.00161 \pm 0.00028$. While some
calculations have found this observation as requiring new physics, we suggest
that scalar resonances nearby to $m_{D^0}$, in particular, $f_0(1710)$ and/or
$f_0(1790)$ cause enhancements for CP violation within the SM. Thereby, our
calculations based on the Standard Model suggest compatibility with the LHCb
observations for now. However, experimental information especially on
$f_0(1790)$ is rather sparse limiting our accuracy and further data on these
resonances is strongly advocated.

applications in almost all areas of physics, from condensed matter and particle
physics to cosmology and astrophysics. Scalar fields, in particular, can give
rise to confined structures, such as boson stars, oscillatons or Q-balls. These
objects are interesting hypothetical new ""dark matter stars"", but also good
descriptions of dark matter cores when the fields are ultralight. In this
thesis, we study the dynamical response of such confined bosonic structures
when excited by external matter (stars, planets or black holes) in their
vicinities. Such perturbers can either be piercing through the bosonic
configuration or undergoing periodic motion at its center (e.g., binaries). Our
setup can also efficiently describe the interaction between a moving massive
black hole and the surrounding environment. It also depicts dark matter
depletion as a reaction to an inspiralling binary within a dark matter core.
Our results provide a complete picture of the interaction between black holes
or stars and the ultralight dark matter core environment where they may live
in. This thesis also deals with several classical field environmental effects
on the motion (or, ultimately, the survival) of compact objects, like black
holes.

689 sources are catalogued as ULX candidates for the first time. Our primary

a peak luminosity of $L_{\rm{X,peak}} \sim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and the

of a novel radioactive catheter for potential use in LDR brachytherapy to
prevent urethral stenosis. Methods: A beta radiation emitting 32P-foil was
developed and integrated in an indwelling catheter, which is usually inserted
after surgical interventions in the urethra. Activity and dose distribution
were measured after neutron activation of the 31P foil component with
scintillation techniques as well as radiochromic films and compared to MC
simulations. Practicability and radiation safety of this new applicator was
tested on male rabbits, which underwent before catheter application a new
method of stricture induction by radial laser light irradiation. Results:
Measured dose distributions of catheters with 32P-foils were found in good
agreement with MC simulations. Wash-out test confirmed the radioactive catheter
setup to be inside the permitted limits of a sealed source. Strictures could be
induced by laser light in all animals, surgically treated by slitting and
irradiation with a 7-day dose of 15 Gy or 30 Gy without adverse radiation
effects during 4 weeks observation time. Conclusions: This prove-of-concept
study presents a save and technically uncomplicated approach of LDR
brachytherapy intending to prevent urethral stenosis. The prescribed
irradiation dose can be administered in a reproducible and precise manner using
a urethral catheter as carrier of a beta radiating foil. The study duration of
63 days was too short for statistically significant stricture related
conclusions. This approach may be considered for similar problems in other

bounds on the parameter space of $\rm{U}_1$ relevant for the anomalies. Precise
bounds are drawn by recasting the latest $\tau\tau$ and $\mu\mu$ searches by

find this spatial valley texture in the exciton Bloch function is

of directional exciton flow through the valley selection rule. The left-right

range of applications including exoplanet discoveries, structure of the Milky
Way, constraints on MAssive Compact Halo Objects, and measurements of the size
and profile of quasar accretion discs. In this paper, we consider a special
type of microlensing events where the sources are fast radio bursts with
$\sim$milliseconds (ms) durations for which the relative motion between the
lens and source is negligible. In this scenario, it is possible to temporally
resolve the individual microimages. As a result, a method beyond the inverse
ray shooting (IRS) method, which only evaluates the total magnification of all
microimages, is needed. We therefore implement an algorithm for identifying
individual microimages and computing their magnifications and relative time
delays. We validate our algorithm by comparing to analytical predictions for a
single microlens case and find excellent agreement. We show that the
superposition of pulses from individual microimages produces a light curve that
appears as multi-peaked FRBs. The relative time delays between pulses can reach
0.1--1 ms for stellar-mass lenses and hence can already be resolved temporally
by current facilities. Although not yet discovered, microlensing of FRBs will
become regular events and surpass the number of quasar microlensing events in
the near future when $10^{4-5}$ FRBs are expected to be discovered on a daily
basis. Our algorithm provides a way of generating the microlensing light curve
that can be used for constraining stellar mass distribution in distant
galaxies.

of data points and their associated labels. Despite seeing very few true data
points during training, models trained using Mixup seem to still minimize the
original empirical risk and exhibit better generalization and robustness on
various tasks when compared to standard training. In this paper, we investigate
how these benefits of Mixup training rely on properties of the data in the
context of classification. For minimizing the original empirical risk, we
compute a closed form for the Mixup-optimal classification, which allows us to
construct a simple dataset on which minimizing the Mixup loss can provably lead
to learning a classifier that does not minimize the empirical loss on the data.
On the other hand, we also give sufficient conditions for Mixup training to
also minimize the original empirical risk. For generalization, we characterize
the margin of a Mixup classifier, and use this to understand why the decision
boundary of a Mixup classifier can adapt better to the full structure of the
training data when compared to standard training. In contrast, we also show
that, for a large class of linear models and linearly separable datasets, Mixup
training leads to learning the same classifier as standard training.

of an $N$-dimensional Boolean lattice are colored in blue and red, there is
either a copy of $P$ with all blue elements or a copy of $Q$ with all red
elements. We focus on a poset Ramsey number $R(P, Q_n)$ for a fixed poset $P$
and an $n$-dimensional Boolean lattice $Q_n$, as $n$ grows large. We show a
sharp jump in behaviour of this number as a function of $n$ depending on
whether or not $P$ contains a copy of either a poset $V$, i.e. a poset on
elements $A, B, C$ such that $B>C$, $A>C$, and $A$ and $B$ incomparable, or a
poset $\Lambda$, its symmetric counterpart. Specifically, we prove that if $P$

This gives the first non-marginal improvement of a lower bound on poset Ramsey

generation wireless communication networks, research community is increasingly
dependent on using machine learning solutions for real-time decision-making and
radio resource management. Traditional machine learning employs fully
centralized architecture in which the entire training data is collected at one
node e.g., cloud server, that significantly increases the communication
overheads and also raises severe privacy concerns. Towards this end, a
distributed machine learning paradigm termed as Federated learning (FL) has
been proposed recently. In FL, each participating edge device trains its local
model by using its own training data. Then, via the wireless channels the
weights or parameters of the locally trained models are sent to the central PS,
that aggregates them and updates the global model. On one hand, FL plays an
important role for optimizing the resources of wireless communication networks,
on the other hand, wireless communications is crucial for FL. Thus, a
`bidirectional' relationship exists between FL and wireless communications.
Although FL is an emerging concept, many publications have already been
published in the domain of FL and its applications for next generation wireless
networks. Nevertheless, we noticed that none of the works have highlighted the
bidirectional relationship between FL and wireless communications. Therefore,
the purpose of this survey paper is to bridge this gap in literature by
providing a timely and comprehensive discussion on the interdependency between
FL and wireless communications.

of the underlying data distribution. Extensive simulations demonstrate the

further apply the new test to a single-cell data set to test the independence
between two types of single-cell sequencing measurements, whose high

a node is sampled proportionally to its degree. The implication of such biases
has not been clear, particularly in the context of graph representation
learning. Here, we investigate the impact of the random walks' bias on graph

consistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set

practice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying
sequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic).
Also, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse. This paper presents a novel
semi-supervised method that efficiently captures dependencies between network
time series and across time points to generate meaningful representations of
network activities for predicting abnormal events. The method can use the
limited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal

of our purposes is to resolve the inter-scale energy flux $P$ in the stationary

importantly, we perform a quartet-level decomposition of $P=\sum_\Omega
P_\Omega$, with each component $P_\Omega$ representing the contribution from
quartet interactions with frequency mismatch $\Omega$, in order to explain the
properties of $P$ as well as study the wave-turbulence closure model. Our
results show that time series of $P$ closely follows a Gaussian distribution,
with its standard deviation several times its mean value $\overline{P}$. This
large standard deviation is shown to mainly result from the fluctuation (in
time) of the quasi-resonances, i.e., $P_{\Omega\neq 0}$. The scaling of
spectral level with $\overline{P}$ exhibits $\overline{P}^{1/3}$ and
$\overline{P}^{1/2}$ at high and low nonlinearity, consistent with the kinetic

regimes are explained through the dominance of quasi-resonances ($P_{\Omega\neq

fourth-order correlators to products of pair correlators through a broadening
function $f(\Omega)$, sometimes argued to be a $sinc$ function in the theory.

use the spectra to accurately determine classifications and spectrophotometric

orientability. It is widely believed that spatial orientability can only be
tested by global journeys around the Universe to check for
orientation-reversing closed paths. Since such global journeys are not
feasible, theoretical arguments that combine universality of physical
experiments with local arrow of time, CP violation and CPT invariance are
usually offered to support the choosing of time- and space-orientable spacetime
manifolds. The nonexistence of globally defined spinor fields on a
non-orientable spacetime is another theoretical argument for orientability.
However, it is conceivable that orientability can be put to test by local
physical effects. In this paper, we show that it is possible to locally access
spatial orientability of a spatially flat Friedmann--Robertson-Walker spacetime
through quantum vacuum electromagnestic fluctuations. We argue that a putative
non-orientability of the spatial sections of spatially flat FRW spacetime can
be ascertained by the study of the stochastic motions of a charged particle or
a point electric dipole under quantum vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations. In
particular, the stochastic motions of a dipole permit the recognition of a
presumed non-orientability of $3-$space in itself.

structures in the solution space of the parabolic partial differential
equations (PDEs) in the forward problem with a given class of source functions
and construct a small number of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) basis
functions to achieve significant dimension reduction. Equipped with the POD
basis functions, we can solve the forward problem extremely fast in the online
stage. Thus, we develop a fast algorithm to solve the optimization problem in
the parabolic inverse source problems, which is referred to as the POD
algorithm in this paper. Under a weak regularity assumption on the solution of
the parabolic PDEs, we prove the convergence of the POD algorithm in solving
the forward parabolic PDEs. In addition, we obtain the error estimate of the

numerical examples to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed

insects, birds, fish, and even some aquatic invertebrates, are often vastly
superior to what even the most advanced human-engineered vehicles operating in
the same regimes are capable of. Key to this superior locomotion is the
animal's manipulation of the generation and shedding of vortices through
optimal control of their motion kinematics. Many research efforts related to
biological and bio-inspired propulsion focus on understanding the influence of
the motion kinematics on the propulsion performance and on optimising the
kinematics to improve efficiency or manoeuvrability. One of the first
challenges to tackle when conducting a numerical or experimental optimisation
of motion kinematics of objects moving through a fluid is the parameterisation
of the motion kinematics. In this paper, we present three different approaches
to parameterise kinematics, using a set of control points that are connected by
a spline interpolation, a finite Fourier series, and a reduced order modal
reconstruction based on a proper orthogonal decomposition of a set of random
walk trajectories. We compare the results and performance of the different
parameterisations for the example of an experimental multi-objective
optimisation of the pitching kinematics of a robotic flapping wing device. The
optimisation was conducted using a genetic algorithm with the objective to
maximise stroke average lift and efficiency. The performance is evaluated with
regard to the diversity of the randomly created initial populations, the
convergence behaviour of the optimisation, and the final Pareto fronts with
their corresponding fitness values.

configurations taking into account of random arrival of data and energy at the

characterizes these metrics under jamming attack. The impact of finite and
infinite energy battery size at the jammer on various performance metrics is
also explored. Two optimization problems are considered to explore the

construct a patch network tailored to the linear region where the buggy input

repaired network is guaranteed to fix the buggy input, and a patch is
guaranteed to be found for any buggy input. Moreover, our approach preserves
the continuous piecewise linear nature of ReLU networks, automatically
generalizes the repair to all the points including other undetected buggy
inputs inside the repair region, is minimal in terms of changes in the function
space, and guarantees that outputs on inputs away from the repair region are
unaltered. On several benchmarks, we show that our approach significantly

vulnerable to adversarial manipulation and backdoor attacks. Backdoored models
deviate from expected behavior on inputs with predefined triggers while
retaining performance on clean data. Recent works focus on software simulation
of backdoor injection during the inference phase by modifying network weights,
which we find often unrealistic in practice due to restrictions in hardware.
  In contrast, in this work for the first time, we present an end-to-end
backdoor injection attack realized on actual hardware on a classifier model
using Rowhammer as the fault injection method. To this end, we first
investigate the viability of backdoor injection attacks in real-life
deployments of DNNs on hardware and address such practical issues in hardware
implementation from a novel optimization perspective. We are motivated by the
fact that vulnerable memory locations are very rare, device-specific, and
sparsely distributed. Consequently, we propose a novel network training
algorithm based on constrained optimization to achieve a realistic backdoor
injection attack in hardware. By modifying parameters uniformly across the
convolutional and fully-connected layers as well as optimizing the trigger
pattern together, we achieve state-of-the-art attack performance with fewer bit

on CIFAR-10 achieves over 89% test accuracy and 92% attack success rate by
flipping only 10 out of 2.2 million bits.

instantaneous fluctuating velocity as well as temperature in a range of
stability conditions. These data permit investigation of the three-dimensional
statistical structure of turbulence structures. The present work extends the
view of a self-similar range of wall-attached turbulence structures to the
atmospheric surface layer under unstable and near-neutral stability conditions,
and includes the statistical structure in both the wall-normal and spanwise
directions in relation to the streamwise wavelength. Results suggest that the
self-similar wall-attached structures have similar aspect ratios between
streamwise/wall-normal scales and streamwise/spanwise scales such that
$\lambda_x/\Delta z : \lambda_x/\Delta y \approx 1$ for both near-neutral and
unstable conditions. By analysing the phase shift between synchronized
measurements, in the spectral domain, it is quantified how the structure
inclination angle varies with stability. Under the most unstable conditions,
coherent structures of $\lambda_x/\delta = 1$ are inclined at angles as high as
$65^\circ$ relative to the solid boundary, while larger scales of
$\lambda_x/\delta = 6$ exhibit inclination angles of approximately $35^\circ$.
For near-neutral stability conditions, the angle tends towards $12^\circ$ for
all scales. It is noted that in the near-neutral condition, the structure
inclination angle and the aspect ratio -- and thus the statistical modeling of
coherent structures in the ASL -- are highly sensitive to the value of the
stability parameter.

that the activation time of oscillations coincides with the passage of a

wave is not always easily detected. Aiming to contribute to understand how --
and to what extent -- coronal waves are able to excite filament oscillations,
here we modelled with 2.5 MHD simulations a filament floating in a

simplified scenario results in a two-coupled oscillation pattern of the
filament which is damped in a few cycles, enabling a detailed analysis. A
parametric study was accomplished varying parameters of the scenario such as
height, size and mass of the filament. An oscillatory analysis reveals a
general tendency where periods of oscillations, amplitudes and damping times
increase with height, whereas filaments of larger radius exhibit shorter
periods and smaller amplitudes. The calculation of forces exerted on the
filament shows that the main restoring force is the magnetic tension.

Model selection reveals the crucial features, reduces the dimensionality of
feature space, and improves model interpretation. In the support vector machine
literature, model selection is achieved by $\ell_1$ penalties. These convex
relaxations seriously bias parameter estimates toward 0 and tend to admit too
many irrelevant features. The current paper presents an alternative that
replaces penalties by sparse-set constraints. Penalties still appear, but serve
a different purpose. The proximal distance principle takes a loss function
$L(\boldsymbol{\beta})$ and adds the penalty
$\frac{\rho}{2}\mathrm{dist}(\boldsymbol{\beta}, S_k)^2$ capturing the squared
Euclidean distance of the parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ to the sparsity
set $S_k$ where at most $k$ components of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ are nonzero. If
$\boldsymbol{\beta}_\rho$ represents the minimum of the objective
$f_\rho(\boldsymbol{\beta})=L(\boldsymbol{\beta})+\frac{\rho}{2}\mathrm{dist}(\boldsymbol{\beta},

to succeed (e.g., a knife and cutting board brought together with a tomato are
conducive to cutting). We encode our video-based prior as an auxiliary reward
function that encourages an agent to bring compatible objects together before
attempting an interaction. In this way, our model translates everyday human

Globally, SARS-CoV-2 evolutionarily deletes its genome to significantly enhance
its infection capacity (tau = -0.64 and p_value= 1.39e-101), and it remarkably
deletes 66 features whereas only gains 18 features. Yet only mutating signature
features such as TTA, GCT and CG increases its infection potential. In organism

(PV) has been widely integrated into distribution systems. Most rooftop PV
systems are installed behind-the-meter (BTM), i.e., only the net demand is
metered, while the native demand and PV generation are not separately recorded.
Under this condition, the PV generation and native demand are invisible to
utilities, which brings challenges for optimal distribution system operation
and expansion. In this paper, we have come up with a novel two-layer approach
to disaggregate the unknown PV generation and native demand from the known
hourly net demand data recorded by smart meters: 1) At the aggregate level, the
proposed approach separates the total PV generation and native demand time
series from the total net demand time series for customers with PVs. 2) At the
customer level, the separated aggregate-level PV generation is allocated to
individual PVs. These two layers leverage the spatial correlations of native
demand and PV generation, respectively. One primary advantage of our proposed
approach is that it is more independent and practical compared to previous
works because it does not require PV array parameters, meteorological data and
previously recorded solar power exemplars. We have verified our proposed
approach using real native demand and PV generation data.

infraction could lead to catastrophic failure. In this work, we study the
problem of safe reinforcement learning (RL) for autonomous racing, using the
vehicle's ego-camera view and speed as input. Given the nature of the task,
autonomous agents need to be able to 1) identify and avoid unsafe scenarios
under the complex vehicle dynamics, and 2) make sub-second decision in a
fast-changing environment. To satisfy these criteria, we propose to incorporate
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory, a safety verification method for
general non-linear systems, into the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP)
framework. HJ reachability not only provides a control-theoretic approach to
learn about safety, but also enables low-latency safety verification. Though HJ
reachability is traditionally not scalable to high-dimensional systems, we
demonstrate that with neural approximation, the HJ safety value can be learned
directly on vision context -- the highest-dimensional problem studied via the

challenge. Backpropagation is not directly applicable, nor are the
reparameterization tricks used in networks with continuous stochastic

Assignment (HNCA), a novel gradient estimation algorithm for networks of
discrete stochastic units. HNCA works by assigning credit to each unit based on
the degree to which its output influences its immediate children in the
network. We prove that HNCA produces unbiased gradient estimates with reduced
variance compared to the REINFORCE estimator, while the computational cost is
similar to that of backpropagation. We first apply HNCA in a contextual bandit
setting to optimize a reward function that is unknown to the agent. In this
setting, we empirically demonstrate that HNCA significantly outperforms
REINFORCE, indicating that the variance reduction implied by our theoretical
analysis is significant and impactful. We then show how HNCA can be extended to
optimize a more general function of the outputs of a network of stochastic
units, where the function is known to the agent. We apply this extended version
of HNCA to train a discrete variational auto-encoder and empirically show it
compares favourably to other strong methods. We believe that the ideas
underlying HNCA can help stimulate new ways of thinking about efficient credit
assignment in stochastic compute graphs.

problem of identifying which queries expose a given piece of content in the
ranking results is an important and relatively under-explored search
transparency challenge. Exposing queries are useful for quantifying various
issues of search bias, privacy, data protection, security, and search engine
optimization.
  Exact identification of exposing queries in a given system is computationally
expensive, especially in dynamic contexts such as web search. We explore the
feasibility of approximate exposing query identification (EQI) as a retrieval
task by reversing the role of queries and documents in two classes of search
systems: dense dual-encoder models and traditional BM25 models. We then propose
how this approach can be improved through metric learning over the retrieval
embedding space. We further derive an evaluation metric to measure the quality
of a ranking of exposing queries, as well as conducting an empirical analysis
focusing on various practical aspects of approximate EQI. Overall, our work
contributes a novel conception of transparency in search systems and

monotonic behavior but also with a periodic physical clock variable, coupled to
the degrees of freedom of a system evolving in time. Generically, one would in
fact expect some kind of oscillating motion of a system that is dynamical and
interacts with its surroundings, as required for a fundamental clock that can
be noticed by any other system. Unitary evolution does not require a monotonic
clock variable and can be achieved more generally by formally unwinding the
periodic clock movement, keeping track not only of the value of the clock
variable but also of the number of cycles it has gone through at any moment. As
a result, the clock is generically in a quantum state with a superposition of
different clock cycles, a key feature that distinguishes oscillating clocks
from monotonic time. Because the clock and an evolving system have a common
conserved energy, the clock is in different cycles for different energy
eigenstates of the system state. Coherence could therefore be lost faster than
observed, for instance if a system that would be harmonic in isolation is made
anharmonic by interactions with a fundamental clock, implying observational
bounds on fundamental clocks. Numerical computations show that coherence is
almost maintained over long time scales provided the clock period is much
smaller than the system period. Since the precision of atomic clocks could not
be achieved if atomic frequencies would be subject to additional variations
from coupling to a fundamental clock, an upper bound on the clock period can be
obtained that turns out to be much smaller than currently available direct or
indirect measurements of time. (abbreviated)

only image labels is still an open problem for RGB-D scene recognition. In this
paper, we propose an efficient framework for RGB-D scene recognition, which
adaptively selects important local features to capture the great spatial
variability of scene images. Specifically, we design a differentiable local
feature selection (DLFS) module, which can extract the appropriate number of
key local scenerelated features. Discriminative local theme-level and
object-level representations can be selected with the DLFS module from the
spatially-correlated multi-modal RGB-D features. We take advantage of the
correlation between RGB and depth modalities to provide more cues for selecting
local features. To ensure that discriminative local features are selected, the
variational mutual information maximization loss is proposed. Additionally, the
DLFS module can be easily extended to select local features of different
scales. By concatenating the local-orderless and global structured multi-modal
features, the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on

symmetric achromatic variability (SAV) $-$ seen at higher frequencies ($>$

of the core emission by an intervening massive object and is expected to be

of the key parameters in lithium-ion battery modelling. Conventionally, this
diffusion coefficient is estimated through the galvanostatic intermittent
titration technique (GITT). In this work, the validity of GITT and a faster
alternative technique, intermittent current interruption (ICI), are
investigated regarding their effectiveness through a black-box testing
approach. A Doyle-Fuller-Newman model with parameters for a
LiNi$_{0.8}$Mn$_{0.1}$Co$_{0.1}$O$_2$ electrode is used as a fairly faithful
representation as a real battery system, and the GITT and ICI experiments are
simulated to extract the diffusion coefficient. With the parameters used in
this work, the results show that both the GITT and ICI methods can identify the
solid-state diffusion coefficient very well compared to the value used as input
into the simulation model. The ICI method allows more frequent measurement but
the experiment time is 85% less than what takes to perform a GITT test.
Different fitting approaches and fitting length affected the estimation
accuracy, however not significantly. Moreover, a thinner electrode, a higher
C-rate and a greater electrolyte diffusion coefficient will lead to an
estimation of a higher solid-state diffusion coefficient, generally closer to
the target value.

recent improvements in automated testing techniques. As a result, test cases
are often specified in natural language by different employees and many
redundant test cases might exist in the test suite. This increases the (already
high) cost of test execution. Manually identifying similar test cases is a
time-consuming and error-prone task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an
unsupervised approach to identify similar test cases. Our approach uses a
combination of text embedding, text similarity and clustering techniques to
identify similar test cases. We evaluate five different text embedding
techniques, two text similarity metrics, and two clustering techniques to
cluster similar test steps and four techniques to identify similar test cases
from the test step clusters. Through an evaluation in an industrial setting, we
showed that our approach achieves a high performance to cluster test steps (an
F-score of 87.39%) and identify similar test cases (an F-score of 83.47%).
Furthermore, a validation with developers indicates several different practical
usages of our approach (such as identifying redundant and legacy test cases),
which help to reduce the testing manual effort and time.

First, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation
algorithm to improve the performance of both V2I and V2V links. Specifically,
the algorithm uses deep Q-network (DQN) to solve the sub-band assignment and
deep deterministic policy-gradient (DDPG) to solve the continuous power
allocation problem. Second, we propose a meta-based DRL algorithm to enhance
the fast adaptability of the resource allocation policy in the dynamic

algorithm can significantly improve the performance compared to the DQN-based
algorithm that quantizes continuous power. In addition, the proposed meta-based
DRL algorithm can achieve the required fast adaptation in the new environment

the possibility for bypassing the device complexity associated with tunable
couplers required in conventional quantum computing hardware. Our approach is
based on driving a subarray of qubits such that the total multi-qubit
Hamiltonian can be decomposed into a sum of commuting few-qubit blocks, and
then efficient optimization of the unitary evolution within each block. Each
driving pulse can implement a target gate on the driven qubits, and at the same
time implement identity gates on the neighbouring undriven qubits, cancelling
any unwanted evolution due to the constant qubit-qubit interaction. We show
that it is possible to realise a universal set of quantum gates with high
fidelity on the basis blocks, and by shifting the driving pattern one can
realise an arbitrary quantum circuit on the array. Allowing for imperfect
Hamiltonian characterisation, we use robust optimal control to obtain
fidelities around 99.99% despite 1% uncertainty in the qubit-qubit and
drive-qubit couplings, and a detuning uncertainty at 0.1% of the qubit-qubit
coupling strength. This robust feature is crucial for scaling up as parameter
uncertainty is significant in large devices.

This points towards an incomplete characterisation of the gas luminosity, whose

The emission spectra are fitted with the largest Bayesian chemical model

owing to their non-differentiable and complex neuronal dynamics, most previous
SNN optimization methods have been limited to image recognition. In this paper,
we explore the SNN applications beyond classification and present semantic
segmentation networks configured with spiking neurons. Specifically, we first
investigate two representative SNN optimization techniques for recognition
tasks (i.e., ANN-SNN conversion and surrogate gradient learning) on semantic
segmentation datasets. We observe that, when converted from ANNs, SNNs suffer
from high latency and low performance due to the spatial variance of features.
Therefore, we directly train networks with surrogate gradient learning,
resulting in lower latency and higher performance than ANN-SNN conversion.
Moreover, we redesign two fundamental ANN segmentation architectures (i.e.,
Fully Convolutional Networks and DeepLab) for the SNN domain. We conduct
experiments on two public semantic segmentation benchmarks including the PASCAL
VOC2012 dataset and the DDD17 event-based dataset. In addition to showing the
feasibility of SNNs for semantic segmentation, we show that SNNs can be more

  Journal for Philosophy of Science",,,,"quant-ph physics.hist-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent arguments, involving entangled systems shared by sets of Wigner's
friend arrangements, allegedly show that the assumption that the experiments
performed by the friends yield definite outcomes, is incompatible with quantum
predictions. From this, it is concluded that the results of measurements cannot
be thought of as being actual or objective. Here, I show that these arguments
depend upon a mistaken assumption, regarding the (""mixed"") correlations between
the results of the friends and those of ""the Wigners"", which leads to invalid
predictions. It is not, then, that the assumption of definite outcomes leads to
trouble, but that the results derived with such an assumption are contrasted
with faulty predictions. Next, I explore the more famous no-go theorems by
Frauchiger and Renner and by Brukner, on which these recent arguments are
motivated. Regarding the first, I show that, although it is cast in a different
form, it also rests on the mistaken assumption regarding ""mixed""
correlations--rendering it invalid. Regarding Brukner's theorem, I point out
that it depends on the quite unattractive assumption of locality, a fact that
fully diminishes its force. Throughout, I illustrate my claims with explicit
calculations within pilot-wave theory.

nonlinear trajectory optimization problems, it may not always handle
constraints effectively and its performance may degrade in the presence of
unmodeled disturbances.
  By contrast, CCS can handle probabilistic state and / or input constraints
(e.g., chance constraints) and also steer the state covariance of the system to
a desired positive definite matrix (control of uncertainty) which both imply
that CCS can provide robustness against stochastic disturbances. CCS, however,
suffers from scalability issues and cannot handle complex cost functions in
general.
  We argue that the combination of the two methods yields a class of trajectory
optimization algorithms that can achieve high performance (a feature of MPPI)
while ensuring safety with high probability (a feature of CCS).
  The efficacy of our algorithm is demonstrated in an obstacle avoidance

providing information that can be interpreted clinically to support the
prediction. A subset of the kaggle EyePACS and the Messidor-2 datasets, labeled
with ocular lesions, is made publicly available. The kaggle EyePACS subset is
used as a training set and the Messidor-2 as a test set for lesions and DR

  networks","28 pages, 6 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Filtering for stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) is an important problem in
systems/synthetic biology aiming to estimate the state of unobserved chemical
species. A good solution to it can provide scientists valuable information
about the hidden dynamic state and enable optimal feedback control. Usually,
the model parameters need to be inferred simultaneously with state variables,
and a conventional particle filter can fail to solve this problem accurately
due to sample degeneracy. In this case, the regularized particle filter (RPF)
is preferred to the conventional ones, as the RPF can mitigate sample
degeneracy by perturbing particles with artificial noise. However, the
artificial noise introduces an additional bias to the estimate, and, thus, it
is questionable whether the RPF can provide reliable results for SRNs. In this
paper, we aim to identify conditions under which the RPF converges to the exact
filter in the filtering problem determined by a bimolecular network. First, we
establish computationally efficient RPFs for SRNs on different scales using
different dynamical models, including the continuous-time Markov process,
tau-leaping model, and piecewise deterministic process. Then, by parameter
sensitivity analyses, we show that the established RPFs converge to the exact
filters if all reactions leading to an increase of the molecular population
have linearly growing propensities and some other mild conditions are satisfied
simultaneously. This ensures the performance of the RPF for a large class of
SRNs, and several numerical examples are presented to illustrate our results.

redshift range of $1.57<z<2.4$. Our clustering analysis finds 396 quasar
spectra that are not assigned to any population, 15 misclassified spectra, and
six quasars with incorrect redshifts. We compress the quasar populations into a
library of 684 high signal-to-noise composite spectra, anchored in redshift
space by the Mg II emission line. Principal component analysis on the library
results in an eigenspectrum basis spanning 1067 to 4007 $\r{A}$. We model
independent samples of SDSS quasar spectra with the eigenbasis, allowing for a
free redshift parameter. Our models achieve a median reduced chi-squared on
non-BAL quasar spectra that is reduced by 8.5% relative to models using the
eigenspectra from the SDSS spectroscopic pipeline. A significant contribution
to the relative improvement is from the ability to reconstruct the range of
emission line variation. The redshift estimates from our model are consistent
with the Mg II emission line redshift with an average offset that displays
51.4% less redshift-dependent variation relative to the SDSS eigenspectra. Our
method for developing quasar spectra models can improve automated

nearly all its Shannon information, has great simplicity, circumvents the need
for precise modeling of the time evolution of all components of the
gravitational wave signal, and uses only data largely free of the more
complicated chirp signal. The frequency spectrum of the predicted memory signal
is roughly similar to that of the chirp signal. However its inclusion of lower
frequencies, where noise and data calibration are problematic, makes detection
difficult but not impossible. We applied this novel analysis, implemented with
a template-like algorithm, to a selection of 67 observations of 41 black hole
mergers in the LIGO/Virgo Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog. Statistical
significance was assessed by analyzing many time-shifted intervals. The result:
a few possible detections ($2\sigma-4\sigma$) and many upper limits. The
probability that a random ensemble of 67 strain time series, with the same
noise but no memory signals, will yield a particular figure-of-merit computed

has received a lot of attention, fractional revival is newer and less studied.
One problem is to determine the differences between perfect state transfer and
fractional revival. If perfect state transfer occurs between two vertices in a
graph, the vertices must be cospectral. Further if there is perfect state
transfer between vertices $a$ and $b$ in a graph, there cannot be perfect state
transfer from $a$ to any other vertex. No examples of unweighted graphs with
fractional revival between non-cospectral vertices were known; here we give an
infinite family of such graphs. No examples of unweighted graphs where the
pairs involved in fractional revival overlapped were known; we give examples of
such graphs as well.

attracted considerable attention as targets for understanding pathways towards
molecular complexity in the interstellar medium (ISM). Among these isomers, MF
is decisively abundant in various astronomical objects. For various formation
pathways of MF, surface reactions on cosmic dust would play an important role.
However, when compared to observations, the formation of MF has been found to
be relatively inefficient in laboratory experiments in which methanol
(CH3OH)-dominant ices were processed by ultraviolet (UV) photons and cosmic-ray
analogues. Here, we show experimental results on the effective formation of MF
by the photolysis of CH3OH on water ice at 10 K. We found that the key
parameter leading to the efficient formation of MF is the supply of OH radicals
by the photolysis of H2O, which significantly differs from CH3OH-rich
experimental conditions. Moreover, using an ultra-high-sensitivity surface
analysis method, we succeeded in constraining the decisive formation pathway of
MF via the photolysis of methoxymethanol (MM; CH3OCH2OH), which would improve

of the first useful calculations that noisy quantum computers without error
correction can perform [G. Benenti et al., Phys. Rev. E 65, 066205 (2001)], a
thorough study of the quantum sawtooth map reveals that observing the Lyapunov

three bounds on the ability of any device to observe the Lyapunov regime and
give the first quantitatively accurate description of these bounds: (1) the
Fermi golden rule decay rate must be larger than the Lyapunov rate, (2) the
quantum dynamics must be diffusive rather than localized, and (3) the initial
decay rate must be slow enough for Lyapunov decay to be observable. This last
bound, which has not been recognized previously, places a limit on the maximum
amount of noise that can be tolerated. The theory implies that an absolute
minimum of 6 qubits is required. Recent experiments on IBM-Q and IonQ imply
that some combination of a noise reduction by up to 100$\times$ per gate and
large increases in connectivity and gate parallelization are also necessary.
Finally, scaling arguments are given that quantify the ability of future

layers to enhance the model's prediction performance by a robust approach of
switching off between different neurons. The results show that the proposed
model has low error measurements compared to the other models (i.e., 3D CNN,
CNN-GRU). The model with MC-dropout reduces the error further by an average of

feedback linearization control is designed for every healthy quadcopter such
that quadcopter rotor angular speeds remain bounded and satisfy the
corresponding safety constraints. Simulation results are given to illustrate

the nonlinear system via the spectral equivalence of conjugate systems -
allowing the construction of linear predictors for nonlinear systems. The
universality of the diffeomorphism learner leads to the universal approximation
of the nonlinear system's Koopman eigenfunctions. The developed method is also
safe as it guarantees the model is asymptotically stable regardless of the
representation accuracy. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to close
the gap between the operator, system and learning theories. The efficacy of our

Assuming the unknown function has a low norm in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert

bandit algorithms, and show that it achieves the cumulative regret upper bound
$O^\ast(\sqrt{T\gamma_T})$ using $O(\log\log T)$ batches within time horizon
$T$, where the $O^\ast(\cdot)$ notation hides dimension-independent logarithmic
factors and $\gamma_T$ is the maximum information gain associated with the
kernel. This bound is near-optimal for several kernels of interest and improves
on the typical $O^\ast(\sqrt{T}\gamma_T)$ bound, and our approach is arguably
the simplest among algorithms attaining this improvement. In addition, in the
case of a constant number of batches (not depending on $T$), we propose a
modified version of our algorithm, and characterize how the regret is impacted
by the number of batches, focusing on the squared exponential and Mat\'ern

properties of precursors, main peaks and extended emissions in 26 sGRBs
including GRB 170817A. It is found that peak energies ($E_p$) in each pulse are
uncorrelated with the pulse duration ($t_{dur}$). Meanwhile, we find that there
is no obvious correlation between peak energy and energy fluence.
Interestingly, there is no obvious spectral evolution from earlier precursors
to later extended emissions in view of the correlations of $t_{dur}$ with
either the $E_p$ or the low energy spectrum index, $\alpha$. A power-law
correlation between the average flux ($F_{p}$) and the energy fluence
($S_\gamma$), $log F_p=(0.62\pm0.07) log S_\gamma + (0.27\pm0.07)$, is found to
exist in the individual segments instead of mean peaks previously. Furthermore,
we also find that the main peaks are on average brighter than the precursors or
the extend emissions about one order of magnitude. On the basis of all the
above analyses, one can conclude that three emissive components would share the
same radiation mechanisms but they might be dominated by diverse physical

different from random noise, the adversarial patterns are much easier to be

distribution of normalised scintillation index (NSI). Other sources show
diverse morphologies (compact core, core and one-sided jet, core and two-sided
jets), but there is a correlation between $R$ and NSI with a correlation
coefficient $r=0.47$. A similar $R$--NSI correlation is found in sources

potential of positive transfer between languages, particularly cases where
higher-resourced languages can benefit lower-resourced ones. While training an
MMT model, the supervision signals learned from one language pair can be
transferred to the other via the tokens shared by multiple source languages.
However, the transfer is inhibited when the token overlap among source
languages is small, which manifests naturally when languages use different
writing systems. In this paper, we tackle inhibited transfer by augmenting the
training data with alternative signals that unify different writing systems,
such as phonetic, romanized, and transliterated input. We test these signals on
Indic and Turkic languages, two language families where the writing systems
differ but languages still share common features. Our results indicate that a
straightforward multi-source self-ensemble -- training a model on a mixture of

enormous traction in the last few decades. However, in contrast to the
extensive literature on parity-time (PT) symmetric systems, the exotic
hallmarks of anti-PT symmetric systems are only beginning to be realized now.
Very recently, a characteristic resonance of vanishing linewidth in anti-PT
symmetric systems was shown to exhibit tremendous sensitivity to intrinsic
nonlinearities. Given the primacy of sensing in non-Hermitian systems, in
general, and the immense topicality of anti-PT symmetry, we investigate the
statistical bound to the measurement sensitivity for any arbitrary perturbation
in a dissipatively coupled, anti-PT symmetric system. Using the framework of
quantum Fisher information and the long-time solution to the full master
equation, we analytically compute the Cramer-Rao bound for the system
properties like the detunings and the couplings. As an illustrative example of
this formulation, we inspect and reaffirm the role of a long-lived resonance in
dissipatively interacting systems for sensing applications. \end{abstract}

communication capabilities makes edge computing an attractive solution to pave
the way for the coveted ultra-low latency services. The success of the edge
computing networking paradigm depends on the proper orchestration of the edge
servers. Several Edge applications and services are intolerant to latency,
especially in 5G and beyond networks, such as intelligent video surveillance,
E-health, Internet of Vehicles, and augmented reality applications. The edge
devices underwent rapid growth in both capabilities and size to cope with the
service demands. Orchestrating it on the cloud was a prominent trend during the
past decade. However, the increasing number of edge devices poses a significant
burden on the orchestration delay. In addition to the growth in edge devices,
the high mobility of users renders traditional orchestration schemes
impractical for contemporary edge networks. Proper segmentation of the edge
space becomes necessary to adapt these schemes to address these challenges. In
this paper, we introduce a segmentation technique employing lax clustering and
segregated mobility-based clustering. We then apply latency mapping to these
clusters. The proposed scheme's main objective is to create subspaces
(segments) that enable light and efficient edge orchestration by reducing the
processing time and the core cloud communication overhead. A bench-marking
simulation is conducted with the results showing decreased mobility-related

Moreover, we find that adjusting the position of the channels can improve the

decades. Recently, a weak adversarial network (WAN) proposed in (Y.Zang et al.,

problem defined on arbitrary domains by leveraging the weak solution. WAN
reformulates the PDE problem as a generative adversarial network, where the
weak solution (primal network) and the test function (adversarial network) are
parameterized by the multi-layer deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it is
not yet clear whether DNNs are the most effective model for the parabolic PDE
solutions as they do not take into account the fundamentally different roles
played by time and spatial variables in the solution. To reinforce the
difference, we design a novel so-called XNODE model for the primal network,
which is built on the neural ODE (NODE) model with additional spatial
dependency to incorporate the a priori information of the PDEs and serve as a
universal and effective approximation to the solution. The proposed hybrid
method (XNODE-WAN), by integrating the XNODE model within the WAN framework,
leads to significant improvement in the performance and efficiency of training.
Numerical results show that our method can reduce the training time to a

Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are used for many of these
scientific detectors. Until recently, pixel detector ASICs have been used
mainly for analog signal processing of the charge from the sensor layer and the
transmission of raw pixel data off the detector ASIC. However, with the
availability of more advanced ASIC technology nodes for scientific application,
more digital functionality from the computing domains (e.g., compression) can
be integrated directly into the detector ASIC to increase data velocity.
However, these computing functionalities often have high and variable latency,
whereas scientific detectors must operate in real-time (i.e., stall-free) to
support continuous streaming of sampled data. This paper presents an example
from the domain of pixel detectors with on-chip data compression for X-ray
science applications. To address the challenges of variable-sized data from a
parallel stream of compressors, we present an ASIC design architecture to
coalesce variable-length data for transmission over a fixed bit-width network

  $$i\partial_tu +\partial^2_x u + \mu \delta u +|u|^{4}u=0, \, \, t\in \R, \,
x\in \R , $$
  where $ \mu \in \R$, and $\delta$ is the Dirac delta distribution at $x=0$.
Local well-posedness theory together with sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality
and the conservation laws of mass and energy implies that the solution with
mass less than $\|Q\|_{2}$ is global existence in $H^1(\R)$, where $Q$ is the
ground state of the $L^2$-critical NLS without the delta potential (i.e.
$\mu=0$).
  We are interested in the dynamics of the solution with threshold mass
$\|u_0\|_{2}=\|Q\|_{2}$ in $H^1(\R)$. First, for the case $\mu=0$, such blow-up
solution exists due to the pseudo-conformal symmetry of the equation, and is
unique up to the symmetries of the equation in $H^1(\R)$ from
\cite{Me93:NLS:mini sol} (see also \cite{HmKe05:NLS:mini blp}), and recently in
$L^2(\R)$ from \cite{Dod:NLS:L2thrh1}. Second, for the case $\mu<0$, simple
variational argument with the conservation laws of mass and energy implies that
radial solutions with threshold mass exist globally in $H^1(\R)$. Last, for the
case $\mu>0$, we show the existence of radial threshold solutions with blow-up
speed determined by the sign (i.e. $\mu>0$) of the delta potential perturbation
since the refined blow-up profile to the rescaled equation is stable in a
precise sense. The key ingredients here including the Energy-Morawetz argument
and compactness method as well as the modulation analysis are close to the

the pre-processing of galaxies, where their properties may have been changed by
environmental effects in the filament before they fell into the galaxy cluster.
We present the chemical properties of star-forming dwarf galaxies (SFDGs) in
five filamentary structures (Virgo III, Leo Minor, Leo II A, Leo II B, and
Canes Venatici) around the Virgo cluster using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
optical spectroscopic data and Galaxy Evolution Explorer ultraviolet
photometric data. We investigate the relationship between stellar mass,
gas-phase metallicity, and specific star formation rate (sSFR) of SFDGs in the
Virgo filaments in comparison to those in the Virgo cluster and field. We find
that, at a given stellar mass, SFDGs in the Virgo filaments show lower
metallicity and higher sSFR than those in the Virgo cluster on average. We
observe that SFDGs in the Virgo III filament show enhanced metallicities and
suppressed star formation activities comparable to those in the Virgo cluster,
whereas SFDGs in the other four filaments exhibit similar properties to the
field counterparts. Moreover, about half of the galaxies in the Virgo III
filament are found to be morphologically transitional dwarf galaxies that are
supposed to be on the way to transforming into quiescent dwarf early-type
galaxies. Based on the analysis of the galaxy perturbation parameter, we
propose that the local environment represented by the galaxy interactions might
be responsible for the contrasting features in ""chemical pre-processing"" found

satisfy a dosimetric goal. Methods: The NEEPO algorithm generates a needle pool

the pool based on relative needle importance as determined by total dwell times
within needles. The NEEPO algorithm is based on a convex optimization
formulation using a quadratic dosimetric penalty function, dwell time
regularization by total variation, and a block sparsity regularization term to
enable iterative removal of low-importance needles. RSBT treatment plans for 26

which dominate the whole processes of flaring eruptions. The standard flare
models are well explained the evolution and eruption after magnetic
reconnection around the hot cusp-structure above the top of plasma loops,
however, the early evolution of the plasma loops before the onset of magnetic
reconnection has been poorly understood. Considering that magnetic-gradients
are ubiquitous in solar plasma loops, this work applies the magnetic-gradient
pumping (MGP) mechanism to study the early evolution of flaring plasma loops.
The results indicate that the early evolution depend on the magnetic field
distribution and the geometry of the plasma loops which dominates the balance
between the accumulation and dissipation of energy around loop-tops. Driven by
MGP process, both of the density and temperature as well as the plasma beta
value around the looptop will increase in the early phase of the plasma loops
evolution. In fact, the solar plasma loops will have two distinct evolutionary
results: the low, initial dense plasma loops with relatively strong magnetic
fields tend to be stable for their maximum beta value always smaller than the
critical value, while the higher, initial dilute solar plasma loops with
relatively weak magnetic fields tend to be unstable for their beta values
exceeding the critical value at a time of about one hour after the formation of
the solar magnetized plasma loop. The latter may produce ballooning instability
and finally trigger the following magnetic reconnection and eruptions. These
physical scenarios may provide us a new viewpoint to understand the nature and
origin of solar flares.

efficiently optimize $H_N/N$ up to a value $\mathsf{ALG}$ given by an extended
Parisi formula, which minimizes over a larger space of functional order

leads to a phase transition between individual and social benefits and there is
a critical point, $CP$, that represents a first-order phase transition in the
network. Concerning a real network of relations, individuals adjust the
strength of their relationships based on the benefits they acquire from.
Therefore, addressing heterogeneity in the individual interactions, we study a
modified version of Strauss's model in which the first term represents the
heterogeneous individual benefit by $\theta_{ij}$, and the coefficient of the
second term, $\alpha$, measures the strength of social benefit. Our studies
show that there is a region where the triangles are in a crumpled state rather
than being dispersed in the network and increasing the heterogeneity of
individual benefits results in the narrower region of crumpled state. Out of
this region, the network is a mixture of links and triangles and the value of
$\alpha$ determines whether the individual benefit or social benefit overcomes.
For the small value of $\alpha$ the individual benefit dominates whereas in the
large value of $\alpha$ the social benefit overcomes.

gap between their flat training objective (i.e., equally treats all output

generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose a Hierarchical Curriculum
Learning (HCL) framework with Structure-level (SC) and Instance-level Curricula
(IC). SC switches progressively from core to detail AMR semantic elements while
IC transits from structure-simple to -complex AMR instances during training.
Through these two warming-up processes, HCL reduces the difficulty of learning
complex structures, thus the flat model can better adapt to the AMR hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on AMR2.0, AMR3.0, structure-complex and
out-of-distribution situations verify the effectiveness of HCL.

of their special patch-based architectural structure, i.e., they process an
image as a sequence of image patches. We find that ViTs are surprisingly
insensitive to patch-based transformations, even when the transformation
largely destroys the original semantics and makes the image unrecognizable by
humans. This indicates that ViTs heavily use features that survived such
transformations but are generally not indicative of the semantic class to
humans. Further investigations show that these features are useful but
non-robust, as ViTs trained on them can achieve high in-distribution accuracy,
but break down under distribution shifts. From this understanding, we ask: can
training the model to rely less on these features improve ViT robustness and
out-of-distribution performance? We use the images transformed with our
patch-based operations as negatively augmented views and offer losses to
regularize the training away from using non-robust features. This is a
complementary view to existing research that mostly focuses on augmenting
inputs with semantic-preserving transformations to enforce models' invariance.
We show that patch-based negative augmentation consistently improves robustness
of ViTs across a wide set of ImageNet based robustness benchmarks. Furthermore,
we find our patch-based negative augmentation are complementary to traditional
(positive) data augmentation, and together boost the performance further.

enhanced the ability of neural networks to perceive objects at different

of transformers is time-consuming. Moreover, different branches of the
multi-branch modules could cause the same error back propagation in each
training iteration, which is not conducive to extracting discriminative
features. To solve these problems, we propose a bilateral network based on
transformer and CNN to efficiently broaden local details and global semantic
information simultaneously. Besides, a Multi-Head Boosting (MHB) strategy is
proposed to enhance the specificity of different network branches. By
calculating the errors of different prediction heads, each branch can
separately pay more attention to the pixels that other branches predict
incorrectly. Moreover, Unlike multi-path parallel training, MHB randomly
selects one branch each time for gradient back propagation in a boosting way.
Additionally, an Attention Feature Fusion Module (AF) is proposed to fuse two
types of features according to respective characteristics. Comprehensive

code of SPEX software to fit archival XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations in

ionization states (log$\xi$ [erg cm/s]~-1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0). The
highest-ionization WA has a higher hydrogen column density (~$10^{22}$/cm$^2$)

in 2006, which was missed by previous studies. It can be explained by a single
obscurer. We also study the previously published obscuration event in 2016,
which needs two obscurers in the fit. A high-ionization obscurer
(log$\xi$~2.80; covering factor $C_f$~30%) only appears in 2016, which has a

Floquet quasi-equilibrium where the density matrix is diagonal under the

the current responses and their power features, i.e. the power input behavior,
are discussed in a unified manner, which reveals that there exist an intrinsic

energy and corresponds to the Floquet quasi-equilibrium, while the extrinsic
part needs a sustained energy input and originates from a shift between two
equilibrium ensembles. We further investigate the role of the external driving
field strength finding that large DC currents can be generated under a
relatively strong but not too strong driving field.

in computational geometry introduced in Mitchell and Papadimitriou (JACM

we relate its local optimality condition with Snell's law and provide an

SDSS MOC 4 was released with $\sim$4 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ measurements of asteroid
positions and colors in the early 2000s. A number of works then devised methods
to classify these data within the framework of existing taxonomic systems. Some
of these works, however, used 2D parameter space that displayed a continuous
distribution of clouds of data points resulting in boundaries that were
artificially defined. We introduce here a more advanced method to classify
asteroids based on existing systems. This approach is simply represented by a
triplet of SDSS colors. The distributions and memberships of each taxonomic
type are determined by machine learning methods in the form of both
unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. We apply our scheme to MOC 4

different taxonomy classifications with which we have a sufficient number of

a 2D plane were separated with relatively clear boundaries in the 3D space

different taxonomic types, which is an improvement over existing systems. This
new method for taxonomic classification has a great deal of scalability for
asteroid research, such as space weathering in the S-complex, and the origin

about the world's latent variables is thus an important computation for the
brain. However, computational constraints limit the performance of these
computations. These constraints include energetic costs for neural activity and
noise on every channel. Efficient coding is one prominent theory that describes
how such limited resources can best be used. In one incarnation, this leads to
a theory of predictive coding, where predictions are subtracted from signals,
reducing the cost of sending something that is already known. This theory does
not, however, account for the costs or noise associated with those predictions.
Here we offer a theory that accounts for both feedforward and feedback costs,
and noise in all computations. We formulate this inference problem as
message-passing on a graph whereby feedback serves as an internal control
signal aiming to maximize how well an inference tracks a target state while
minimizing the costs of computation. We apply this novel formulation of
inference as control to the canonical problem of inferring the hidden scalar
state of a linear dynamical system with Gaussian variability. The best solution
depends on architectural constraints, such as Dale's law, the ubiquitous law
that each neuron makes solely excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic
connections. This biological structure can create asymmetric costs for
feedforward and feedback channels. Under such conditions, our theory predicts
the gain of optimal predictive feedback and how it is incorporated into the
inference computation. We show that there is a non-monotonic dependence of
optimal feedback gain as a function of both the computational parameters and
the world dynamics, leading to phase transitions in whether feedback provides
any utility in optimal inference under computational constraints.

to meet this need primarily include field measurements for estimating one or
more of the principal stresses from a borehole, or optimization methods for
constructing a 3D geomechanical model in terms of geophysical measurements.
These methods, however, often contain considerable uncertainty in estimating
the state of stress. In this paper, we build on a Bayesian approach to quantify
uncertainty in stress estimations for subsurface engineering applications. This
approach can provide an estimate of the 3D distribution of stress throughout
the volume of interest and provide an estimate of the uncertainty arising from
the stress measurement, the rheology parameters, and a paucity of measurements.
The value of this approach is demonstrated using stress measurements from the
In Salah carbon storage site, which was one of the first industrial carbon
capture and storage projects in the world. This demonstration shows the
application of this Bayesian approach for estimating the initial state of
stress for In Salah and quantifying the uncertainty in the estimated stress.
Also, an assessment of a maximum injection pressure to prevent geomechanical
risks from CO2 injection pressures is provided in terms of the probability
distribution of the minimum principal stress quantified by the approach. With
the In Salah case study, this paper demonstrates that using the Bayesian
approach can provide additional insights for site explorations and/or project
operations to make informed-site decisions for subsurface engineering
applications.

emission was broadband with a typical gyrosynchrotron spectrum, while a
quasi-periodic enhancement of the decimetric emission appeared in a narrow

mechanism. The periodicity that we found in microwaves is about 30 s, coming
from a compact loop-like source with a typical height of about 31 Mm. The
decimetric emission demonstrated a periodicity about 6 s. We suggested a
qualitative scenario linking the QPPs observed in both incoherent and coherent
spectral bands and their generation mechanisms. The properties of the QPPs
found in the microwave signal are typical for perturbations of the flare loop
by the standing sausage mode of a fast magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave. Our
analysis indicated that this sausage-oscillating flare loop was the primary
source of oscillations in the discussed event. The suggested scenario is that a
fundamental sausage harmonic is the dominant cause for the observed QPPs in the
microwave emission. The initiation of oscillations in the decimetric emission
is caused by the third sausage harmonic via periodic and nonlinear triggering
of the acceleration processes in the current sheets, formed at the interface
between the sausage-oscillating flare loop and the external coronal loop that
extended to higher altitudes. Our results demonstrate the possible role of MHD
wave processes in the release and transport of energy during solar flares,

(2) a polygonal pooling (PolyPool) procedure by utilizing the multi-resolution

matched filters based on the local channel state information while the CPU
deploys receiver filters based on knowledge of channel statistics. We devise
the maximization problem of the SE PF, which maximizes the sum of the logarithm
of the achievable user rates, as a jointly nonconvex optimization problem of

The MPJR finite elements, previously developed for partial slip contact
problems, are herein further generalized in order to deal with finite sliding
displacements. The approach is applied to a case study concerning a periodic
contact problem between a sinusoidal profile and a viscoelastic layer of finite
thickness. In particular, the effect of using three different rheological
models that are based on Prony series (with one, two, or three arms) to
approximate the viscoelastic behaviour of a real polymer is investigated. The
method allows for predicting the whole transient regime during the normal
contact problem and the subsequent sliding scenario from full stick to full

proposed approach aims at tackling a class of problems that are difficult to
address with other methods, which include the possibility of analysing
indenters of generic profile, the capability of simulating partial slip and

real-world networks. Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks(HGNNs) extend GNNs to
hyperbolic space and thus are more effective to capture the hierarchical
structures of graphs in node representation learning. In hyperbolic geometry,
the graph hierarchical structure can be reflected by the curvatures of the
hyperbolic space, and different curvatures can model different hierarchical
structures of a graph. However, most existing HGNNs manually set the curvature
to a fixed value for simplicity, which achieves a suboptimal performance of
graph learning due to the complex and diverse hierarchical structures of the

Hyperbolic Graph NeuralNetwork named ACE-HGNN to adaptively learn the optimal
curvature according to the input graph and downstream tasks. Specifically,
ACE-HGNN exploits a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework and contains
two agents, ACE-Agent andHGNN-Agent for learning the curvature and node
representations, respectively. The two agents are updated by a NashQ-leaning
algorithm collaboratively, seeking the optimal hyperbolic space indexed by the

demonstrate a significant and consistent performance improvement in model

fixes, security patches, and refactorings. However, when a library evolves, it
may break the contract previously established with its clients by introducing
Breaking Changes (BCs) in its API. These changes might trigger compile-time,
link-time, or run-time errors in client code. As a result, clients may hesitate
to upgrade their dependencies, raising security concerns and making future
upgrades even more difficult.Understanding how libraries evolve helps client
developers to know which changes to expect and where to expect them, and
library developers to understand how they might impact their clients. In the
most extensive study to date, Raemaekers et al. investigate to what extent
developers of Java libraries hosted on the Maven Central Repository (MCR)
follow semantic versioning conventions to signal the introduction of BCs and
how these changes impact client projects. Their results suggest that BCs are
widespread without regard for semantic versioning, with a significant impact on
clients.In this paper, we conduct an external and differentiated replication
study of their work. We identify and address some limitations of the original
protocol and expand the analysis to a new corpus spanning seven more years of
the MCR. We also present a novel static analysis tool for Java bytecode,
Maracas, which provides us with: (i) the set of all BCs between two versions of
a library; and (ii) the set of locations in client code impacted by individual
BCs. Our key findings, derived from the analysis of 119, 879 library upgrades
and 293, 817 clients, contrast with the original study and show that 83.4% of
these upgrades do comply with semantic versioning. Furthermore, we observe that
the tendency to comply with semantic versioning has significantly increased
over time. Finally, we find that most BCs affect code that is not used by any
client, and that only 7.9% of all clients are affected by BCs. These findings
should help (i) library developers to understand and anticipate the impact of
their changes; (ii) library users to estimate library upgrading effort and to
pick libraries that are less likely to break; and (iii) researchers to better
understand the dynamics of library-client co-evolution in Java.

antenna elements and clever precoder designs to achieve array gain and
spatially multiplex different users. These precoders require linear front-ends,
and more specifically linear power amplifiers (PAs). However, this reduces
energy efficiency since PAs are most efficient close to saturation, where they
generate most nonlinear distortion. Moreover, the use of conventional
precoders, such as \gls{mrt}, induces a coherent combining of distortion at the
user location, degrading the signal quality. In this work, a linear precoder is
proposed that allows working close to saturation while canceling the coherent
combining of the third order nonlinear \gls{pa} distortion at the user
location. In contrast to other solutions, the zero third-order distortion
(Z3RO) precoder does not require prior knowledge of the signal statistics and
the PA model. The design consists of saturating a single or a few antennas on
purpose together with an opposite phase shift to compensate for the distortion
of all other antennas. The resulting array gain penalty becomes negligible as
the number of base station antennas grows large.

Python library for fast and scalable Bayesian optimization. It has been
developed mainly for application in the basic sciences such as physics and
materials science. Bayesian optimization is used to select an appropriate input
for experiments/simulations from candidate inputs listed in advance in order to
obtain better output values with the help of machine learning prediction.
PHYSBO can be used to find better solutions for both single and multi-objective
optimization problems. At each cycle in the Bayesian optimization, a single
proposal or multiple proposals can be obtained for the next
experiments/simulations. These proposals can be obtained interactively for use
in experiments. PHYSBO is available at

techniques widely used in language engineering. The former, relies on
strategies to apply term rewrite rules in defining language transformations,
while the latter is suitable to express context-dependent language processing
algorithms. Each of these techniques, however, is usually implemented by its
own powerful and large language processor system. As a result, it makes such
systems harder to extend and to combine.
  In this paper, we present the embedding of both strategic tree rewriting and
attribute grammars in a zipper-based, purely functional setting. Zippers
provide a simple, but generic tree-walk mechanism that is the building block
technique we use to express the purely-functional embedding of both techniques.
The embedding of the two techniques in the same setting has several advantages:
First, we easily combine/zip attribute grammars and strategies, thus providing
language engineers the best of the two worlds. Second, the combined embedding
is easier to maintain and extend since it is written in a concise and uniform
setting. This results in a very small library which is able to express advanced
(static) analysis and transformation tasks. We show the expressive power of our
library in optimizing Haskell let expressions, expressing several Haskell
refactorings and solving several language processing tasks of the LDTA Tool

where plasticity is referring to the ability to learn new knowledge, and

from previous tasks cannot be legally stored. In this work, we propose to
employ mode connectivity in loss landscapes to achieve better
plasticity-stability trade-off without any previous samples. We give an
analysis of why and how to connect two independently optimized optima of

learned knowledge and granting sufficient flexibility for learning a new task.
This analysis of mode connectivity also provides us a new perspective and
technology to control the trade-off between plasticity and stability. We
evaluate the proposed method on several benchmark datasets. The results
indicate our simple method can achieve notable improvement, and perform well on
both the past and current tasks. On 10-split-CIFAR-100 task, our method

functions on a given arbitrary triangulation $\mathcal{T}$. To this end, we
endow every triangle of $\mathcal{T}$ with a Wang-Shi macro-structure. The
$C^2$ cubic space on such a refined triangulation has a stable dimension and
optimal approximation power. Moreover, any spline function in such space can be
locally built on each of the macro-triangles independently via Hermite
interpolation. We provide a simplex spline basis for the space of $C^2$ cubics
defined on a single macro-triangle which behaves like a Bernstein/B-spline
basis over the triangle. The basis functions inherit recurrence relations and
differentiation formulas from the simplex spline construction, they form a
nonnegative partition of unity, they admit simple conditions for $C^2$ joins
across the edges of neighboring triangles, and they enjoy a Marsden-like
identity. Also, there is a single control net to facilitate control and early
visualization of a spline function over the macro-triangle. Thanks to these
properties, the complex geometry of the Wang-Shi macro-structure is transparent
to the user. Stable global bases for the full space of $C^2$ cubics on the
Wang-Shi refined triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ are deduced from the local simplex
spline basis by extending the concept of minimal determining sets.

topic due to the risks associated to type-I ELMs. By considering non-linear
extended MHD simulations of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak with the JOREK code, we
probe a regime that avoids type-I ELMs completely provided that the separatrix
density is high enough. The dynamics of the pedestal in this regime are
observed to be qualitatively similar to the so-called quasi-continuous exhaust
(QCE) regime in several ways. Repetitive type-I ELMs are substituted by roughly
constant levels of outwards transport caused by peeling-ballooning modes (with
dominant ballooning characteristics) which are localised in the last 5\% of the
confined region (in normalised poloidal flux). The simulated low triangularity
plasma transitions to a type-I ELMy H-mode if the separatrix density is
sufficiently reduced or if the input heating power is sufficiently increased.
The stabilising factors that play a role in the suppression of the small ELMs
are also investigated by analysing the simulations, and the importance of
including diamagnetic effects in the simulations is highlighted. By considering
a scan in the pedestal resistivity and by measuring the poloidal velocity of
the modes (and comparing to theoretical estimates for ideal and resistive
modes), we identify the underlying instabilities as resistive
peeling-ballooning modes. Decreasing the resistivity below
experimentally-relevant conditions (i.e., going towards ideal MHD), the
peeling-ballooning modes that constrain the pedestal below the type-I ELM
stability boundary display sharply decreasing growth rates.

would rebut a theorised gap in planets' mass distribution between those of
Neptune and Jupiter caused by the rapid runaway accretion of super-critical
cores. In an attempt to resolve this theoretical-observational disparity, we
examine the outcomes of giant collisions between sub-critical protoplanets. Due
to the secular interaction among protoplanets, these events may occur in
rapidly depleting discs. We show that impactors ~ 5% the mass of near-runaway
envelopes around massive cores can efficiently remove these envelopes entirely
via a thermally-driven super-Eddington wind emanating from the core itself, in
contrast with the stellar Parker winds usually considered. After a brief
cooling phase, the merged cores resume accretion. But, the evolution timescale
of transitional discs is too brief for the cores to acquire sufficiently
massive envelopes to undergo runaway accretion despite their large combined
masses. Consequently, these events lead to the emergence of CSS without their
transformation into gas giants. We show that these results are robust for a
wide range of disc densities, grain opacities and silicate abundance in the
envelope. Our fiducial case reproduces CSS with heavy (>= 30 M_Earth) cores and
less massive (a few M_Earth) sub-critical envelopes. We also investigate the
other limiting cases, where continuous mergers of comparable-mass cores yield
CSS with wider ranges of core-to-envelope mass ratios and envelope opacities.
Our results indicate that it is possible for CSS and Uranus and Neptune to
emerge within the framework of well studied processes and they may be more
common than previously postulated.

  Spatial Self-Similarity for Texture Debiasing and Domain Adaptation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Models trained on datasets with texture bias usually perform poorly on
out-of-distribution samples since biased representations are embedded into the
model. Recently, various image translation and debiasing methods have attempted
to disentangle texture biased representations for downstream tasks, but
accurately discarding biased features without altering other relevant
information is still challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
that leverages image translation to generate additional training images using
the content of a source image and the texture of a target image with a
different bias property to explicitly mitigate texture bias when training a
model on a target task. Our model ensures texture similarity between the target
and generated images via a texture co-occurrence loss while preserving content
details from source images with a spatial self-similarity loss. Both the
generated and original training images are combined to train improved
classification or segmentation models robust to inconsistent texture bias.
Evaluation on five classification- and two segmentation-datasets with known
texture biases demonstrates the utility of our method, and reports significant
improvements over recent state-of-the-art methods in all cases.

which is applicable under the condition of weak scattering. However, if the
object has high contrasts or is too large compared to the wavelength, it tends
to produce multiple scattering, which complicates the reconstruction. We give a

since maximizing the expected cumulative rewards for RL agents meets the
objective of RS, i.e., improving customers' long-term satisfaction. A key
approach to this goal is offline RL, which aims to learn policies from logged
data. However, the high-dimensional action space and the non-stationary
dynamics in commercial RS intensify distributional shift issues, making it
challenging to apply offline RL methods to RS. To alleviate the action
distribution shift problem in extracting RL policy from static trajectories, we
propose Value Penalized Q-learning (VPQ), an uncertainty-based offline RL
algorithm. It penalizes the unstable Q-values in the regression target by
uncertainty-aware weights, without the need to estimate the behavior policy,
suitable for RS with a large number of items. We derive the penalty weights
from the variances across an ensemble of Q-functions. To alleviate
distributional shift issues at test time, we further introduce the critic
framework to integrate the proposed method with classic RS models. Extensive
experiments conducted on two real-world datasets show that the proposed method
could serve as a gain plugin for existing RS models.

mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with photothermal (PTT) and
antimicrobial combined capabilities have been developed. These nanosystems have
high therapeutic potential to affect the bacterial biofilm architecture and
subsequently inhibit its growth. Nucleation of gold nanorods followed by the
growth of a silica shell leads to a core@shell design (AuNR@MSN) with PTT
properties. Incorporation of nitrosothiol groups (-SNO) with a heat liable
linker, enables an enhanced nitric oxide release upon photothermal stimulation
with near infrared radiation. Further loading of an antimicrobial molecule such
as the levofloxacin (LEVO) antibiotic creates a unique nanoassembly with
potential therapeutic efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus bacterial
biofilms. A dispersion rate of the bacterial biofilm was evident when light
stimuli is applied because impregnation of the nitrosothiol functionalized
nanosystem with the antibiotic LEVO led to ca. 30% reduction but its
illumination with near infrared (NIR) irradiation showed a biofilm reduction of
ca. 90%, indicating that localized antimicrobial exposure and PTT improves the
therapeutic efficacy. These findings envision the conception of
near-infraredactivated nanoparticle carriers capable of combined therapy upon

of levofloxacin and nitric oxide to disrupt the integrity of bacterial biofilms

the corresponding link flows to be distance preserving. The parameters of the

information from a source document and summarizes it into a summary in another
language. It is a challenging task that requires a system to understand,
summarize, and translate at the same time, making it highly related to
Monolingual Summarization (MS) and Machine Translation (MT). In practice, the
training resources for Machine Translation are far more than that for
cross-lingual and monolingual summarization. Thus incorporating the Machine
Translation corpus into CLS would be beneficial for its performance. However,
the present work only leverages a simple multi-task framework to bring Machine
Translation in, lacking deeper exploration. In this paper, we propose a novel
task, Cross-lingual Summarization with Compression rate (CSC), to benefit
Cross-Lingual Summarization by large-scale Machine Translation corpus. Through
introducing compression rate, the information ratio between the source and the
target text, we regard the MT task as a special CLS task with a compression
rate of 100%. Hence they can be trained as a unified task, sharing knowledge
more effectively. However, a huge gap exists between the MT task and the CLS
task, where samples with compression rates between 30% and 90% are extremely
rare. Hence, to bridge these two tasks smoothly, we propose an effective data
augmentation method to produce document-summary pairs with different
compression rates. The proposed method not only improves the performance of the
CLS task, but also provides controllability to generate summaries in desired
lengths. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms various strong
baselines in three cross-lingual summarization datasets. We released our code

$\pi$-tons (or Maki-Thompson diagrams) yield the most relevant vertex

example, dynamical mean field theory estimates of the optical conductivity. By
implementing calculations on the Kadanoff-Baym contour, we reveal the
characteristic spectral signatures of the $\pi$-tons and their evolution under
non-equilibrium conditions. We consider interaction quenches of the
weakly-correlated Hubbard model near the antiferromagnetic phase boundary, and
analyze the evolution of the Drude and $\pi$-ton features. While the bubble
contribution to the optical conductivity is found to thermalize rapidly, after
some oscillations with frequencies related to the local spectral function, the

LHAASO confirm the special interest of this source as a galactic PeVatron
candidate in the northern hemisphere. HAWC J2227+610 emits Very High Energy
(VHE) gamma-rays up to 500 TeV, from a region coincident with molecular clouds
and significantly displaced from the nearby pulsar J2229+6114. Even if this
morphology favours an hadronic origin, both leptonic or hadronic models can
describe the current VHE gamma-ray emission. The morphology of the source is
not well constrained by the present measurements and a better characterisation
would greatly help the understanding of the underlying particle acceleration
mechanisms. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the future most
sensitive Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope and, thanks to its
unprecedented angular resolution, could contribute to better constrain the
nature of this source. The present work investigates the potentiality of CTA to
study the morphology and the spectrum of HAWC J2227+610. For this aim, the
source is simulated assuming the hadronic model proposed by the Tibet AS+MD
collaboration, recently fitted on multi-wavelength data, and two spatial
templates associated to the source nearby molecular clouds. Different CTA
layouts and observation times are considered. A 3D map based analysis shows
that CTA is able to significantly detect the extension of the source and to
attribute higher detection significance to the simulated molecular cloud
template compared to the alternative one. CTA data does not allow to
disentangle the hadronic and the leptonic emission models. However, it permits
to correctly reproduce the simulated parent proton spectrum characterized by a
$\sim$ 500 TeV cutoff.

of policies or skills in environments without external reward. These
pre-trained policies can accelerate learning when endowed with external reward,
and can also be used as primitive options in hierarchical reinforcement
learning. Conventional approaches of unsupervised skill discovery feed a latent
variable to the agent and shed its empowerment on agent's behavior by mutual
information (MI) maximization. However, the policies learned by MI-based
methods cannot sufficiently explore the state space, despite they can be
successfully identified from each other. Therefore we propose a new framework
Wasserstein unsupervised reinforcement learning (WURL) where we directly
maximize the distance of state distributions induced by different policies.
Additionally, we overcome difficulties in simultaneously training N(N >2)
policies, and amortizing the overall reward to each step. Experiments show
policies learned by our approach outperform MI-based methods on the metric of
Wasserstein distance while keeping high discriminability. Furthermore, the
agents trained by WURL can sufficiently explore the state space in mazes and
MuJoCo tasks and the pre-trained policies can be applied to downstream tasks by
hierarchical learning.

black hole discovery, independently of the X-ray transient method. We report
the identification of a single-line binary system LTD064402+245919, with an
orbital period of 14.50 days. The observed component is a subgiant with a mass
of 2.77$\pm$0.68M$_{\odot}$, radius 15.5$\pm$2.5R$_{\odot}$, effective
temperature $T_{\rm eff}$ 4500$\pm$200K, and surface gravity log\emph{g}
2.5$\pm$0.25dex. The discovery makes use of the LAMOST time-domain (LAMOST-TD)
and ZTF survey. Our general-purpose software pipeline applies the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram to determine the orbital period and uses machine-learning to
classify the variable type from the folded light curves. We apply a combined
model to estimate the orbital parameters from both the light and radial
velocity curves, taking constraints on the primary star mass, mass function,
and detection limit of secondary luminosity into consideration. We obtain a
radial velocity semi-amplitude of 44.6$\pm$1.5 km s$^{-1}$, mass ratio of
0.73$\pm$0.07, and an undetected component mass of 2.02$\pm$0.49M$_{\odot}$
when the type of the undetected component is not set. We conclude that the
inclination is not well constrained, and that the secondary mass is larger than
1M$_{\odot}$ when the undetected component is modelled as a compact object.
According to our investigations using an MCMC simulation, increasing the
spectra SNR by a factor of 3 would enable the secondary light to be
distinguished (if present). The algorithm and software in this work are able to
serve as general-purpose tools for the identification of compact objects

effect of peer review on manuscripts by examining differences between the
preprint and published versions using the normalised Levenshtein distance,

nearly equally split between issues of methodology (30.7%), theory (30.0%), and
writing quality (29.2%). Titles, abstracts, and the semantic content of

preprints. Two-thirds of citations were unchanged, 20.9% were added during

the incomplete information about the human hand kinematics result in difficulty
in direct mapping of the high dimensional motion signal of the HG to the RH.
Hence, a method is proposed to estimate the human intent from the high

is propagated outside of its intended scope, which is a violation of the agreed
routing policy. The route leaks can disrupt the internet traffic and cause
large outages. The accurately detection of route leaks requires the share of AS
business relationship information of ASes. However, the business relationship
information between ASes is confidential due to economic issues. Thus, ASes are
usually unwilling to revealing this information to the other ASes, especially
their competitors. Recent advancements in federated learning make it possible
to share data while maintaining privacy. Motivated by this, in this paper we
study the route leak problem by considering the privacy of business
relationships between ASes, and propose a method for route leak detection with
privacy guarantee by using blockchain-based federated learning framework, in
which ASes can train a global detection model without revealing their business
relationships directly. Moreover, the proposed method provides a
self-validation scheme by labeling AS triples with local routing policies,
which mitigates route leaks' lack of ground truth. We evaluate the proposed
method under a variety of datasets including unbalanced and balanced datasets.
The different deployment strategies of the proposed method under different
topologies are also examined. The results show that the proposed method has a
better performance in detecting route leaks than a single AS detection
regardless of whether using balanced or unbalanced datasets. In the analysis of
the deployment, the results show that ASes with more peers have more possible
route leaks and can contribute more on the detection of route leaks with the
proposed method.

simulation (DNS) with two different computational codes for the shallow water
equations are gathered offline and subsequently employed with the aim of
constructing a reduced-order correction. This is used to facilitate
high-fidelity online flow predictions at much reduced costs on coarse meshes.
The resolved small-scale features at high resolution represent subgrid
properties for the coarse representation. Measurements of the subgrid dynamics
are obtained as the difference between the evolution of a coarse grid solution
and the corresponding DNS result. The measurements are sensitive to the
particular numerical methods used for the simulation on coarse computational
grids and can be used to approximately correct the associated discretization
errors. The subgrid features are decomposed into empirical orthogonal functions
(EOFs), after which a corresponding correction term is constructed. By
increasing the number of EOFs in the approximation of the measured values the
correction term can in principle be made arbitrarily accurate. Both
computational methods investigated here show a significant decrease in the
simulation error already when applying the correction based on the dominant
EOFs only. The error reduction accounts for the particular discretization
errors that incur and are hence specific to the particular simulation method
that is adopted. This improvement is also observed for very coarse grids which
may be used for computational model reduction in geophysical and turbulent flow

in spatial statistics. This work addresses the problem of proposing models and
methods to analyze and predict, through kriging, this type of data. To this
purpose, a novel class of transformations, named the Isometric
$\alpha$-transformation ($\alpha$-IT), is proposed, which encompasses the
traditional Isometric Log-Ratio (ILR) transformation. It is shown that the ILR
is the limit case of the $\alpha$-IT as $\alpha$ tends to 0 and that $\alpha=1$
corresponds to a linear transformation of the data. Unlike the ILR, the
proposed transformation accepts 0s in the compositions when $\alpha>0$. Maximum
likelihood estimation of the parameter $\alpha$ is established. Prediction
using kriging on $\alpha$-IT transformed data is validated on synthetic spatial
compositional data, using prediction scores computed either in the geometry
induced by the $\alpha$-IT, or in the simplex. Application to land cover data
shows that the relative superiority of the various approaches w.r.t. a
prediction objective depends on whether the compositions contained any zero
component. When all components are positive, the limit cases (ILR or linear
transformations) are optimal for none of the considered metrics. An
intermediate geometry, corresponding to the $\alpha$-IT with maximum likelihood
estimate, better describes the dataset in a geostatistical setting. When the
amount of compositions with 0s is not negligible, some side-effects of the
transformation gets amplified as $\alpha$ decreases, entailing poor kriging
performances both within the $\alpha$-IT geometry and for metrics in the
simplex.

well-known charging effect mainly observed in nanometer-sized ""electronic

Coulomb diamond features in the scanning gate spectroscopy of a quantum point
contact carved out of a semiconductor heterostructure, in the quantum Hall
regime. Varying the scanning gate parameters and the magnetic field, the
diamonds are found to smoothly evolve to checkerboard patterns. To explain this
surprising behavior, we put forward a model which relies on the presence of a
nanometer-sized Fabry-P\'erot quantum Hall interferometer at the center of the
constriction with tunable tunneling paths coupling the central part of the
interferometer to the quantum Hall channels running along the device edges.
Both types of signatures, diamonds and checkerboards, and the observed
transition, are reproduced by simply varying the interferometer size and the
transmission probabilities at the tunneling paths. The new proposed
interpretation of diamond phenomenology will likely lead to revisit previous
data, and opens the way towards engineering more complex interferometric
devices with nanoscale dimensions.

Ia). We present multi-epoch spectropolarimetry and imaging polarimetry of SN
2019ein, an SN Ia showing high expansion velocities at early phases. The
spectropolarimetry sequence spans from $\sim -11$ to $+$10 days relative to
peak brightness in the $B$-band. We find that the level of the continuum
polarization of SN 2019ein, after subtracting estimated interstellar
polarization, is in the range $0.0-0.3\%$, typical for SNe Ia. The polarization
position angle remains roughly constant before and after the SN light-curve
peak, implying that the inner regions share the same axisymmetry as the outer
layers. We observe high polarization ($\sim 1\%$) across both the Si II
$\lambda6355$ and Ca II near-infrared triplet features. These two lines also
display complex polarization modulations. The spectropolarimetric properties of
SN 2019ein rule out a significant departure from spherical symmetry of the
ejecta for up to a month after the explosion. These observations disfavour
merger-induced and double-detonation models for SN 2019ein. The imaging
polarimetry shows weak evidence for a modest increase in polarization after
$\sim 20$ days since the $B$-band maximum. If this rise is real and is observed
in other SNe Ia at similar phases, we may have seen, for the first time, an
aspherical interior similar to what has been previously observed for SNe IIP.
Future polarization observations of SNe Ia extending to post-peak epochs will
help to examine the inner structure of the explosion.

employs an achromatic half-wave plate (AHWP). It consists of five layers of
a-cut sapphire plate, which are stacked based on a Pancharatnam recipe. In this
way, the retardance of the AHWP is a half-wave over a bandwidth of 34-161 GHz.
The diameter of a single sapphire plate is about 500 mm and the thickness is 5
mm. When a large diameter AHWP is used for a space mission, it is important for
the AHWP to survive launch vibration. A preliminary study indicates that the
five-layer stacked HWP has a risk of breakage at the launch unless the five
layers are glued together and mechanically treated as one disk. We report our
investigation using a sodium silicate solution that can bond the sapphire
plates. This technique has been previously investigated as a candidate of
cryogenic bonding for a mirror material, including sapphire, of the
gravitational wave experiments: LIGO, VIRGO, and KAGRA. We experimentally
studied the mechanical strength of the bonded interface for two different
surface conditions: polished and unpolished. We demonstrated that the tensile
and shear strength > 20 MPa for samples with a polished surface. This satisfied
the requirement of 5.5 MPa derived from the mechanical simulation assuming a
launch load of 30G. We identified that samples glued on a polished surface
exhibit higher strength than unpolished ones by a factor of 2 for tensile and
18 for shear strength. We measured the millimeter-wave transmittance between 90

bonding. We did not find any optical effects caused by the bonded interface

address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Pose-guided Action

which are extremely sensitive to the presence of outliers or heavy tailed
distributions. In contrast, quantile regression is an alternative to OLS that
computes robust quantile based estimates. In this work, the multivariate PLS is
extended to the quantile regression framework, obtaining a theoretical
formulation of the problem and a robust dimensionality reduction technique that
we call fast partial quantile regression (fPQR), that provides quantile based
estimates. An efficient implementation of fPQR is also derived, and its
performance is studied through simulation experiments and the chemometrics well

carbon intensity of electricity generation in the power system. Since actual
carbon dioxide emission measurements are usually lacking, such a signal must be
derived from system-specific emission factors combined with power generation
time series. We present a bottom-up method that allows deriving per country and
per technology emission factors for European countries based on plant specific
power generation time series and reported emissions from the European emissions
trading mechanism. We have matched, 595 fossil generation units and their
respective annual emissions. In 2018, these power plants supplied 717 TWh of
electricity to the grid, representing approximately 50 % of power generation
from fossil fuels. Based on this dataset, 42 individual technology and
country-specific emission factors are derived. The resulting values for
historical per country carbon intensity of electricity generation are compared
with corresponding results from a top-down approach, which uses statistical
data on emissions and power generation on national scales. All calculations are
based on publicly available data, such that the analysis is transparent and the
method can be replicated, adjusted and expanded in a flexible way.

will derive how to compute the gravitational waves emitted by black holes in

detail the data processing techniques that can be used to make it stand above
the detector noise. Finally, we will look for these signals from hyperbolic

develop a two step trigger. The first step of the trigger will be based on
looking for correlations between detectors in the time-frequency domain. The
second step of the trigger will make use of a residual convolutional neural

recently, the AirBox network was launched, consisting of low-cost, small
internet-of-things (IoT) microsensors (i.e., AirBoxes) at thousands of

universal calibration procedure to all AirBoxes does not work well because the
calibration curves vary with several factors, including the chemical
compositions of PM$_{2.5}$, which are not homogeneous in space. Therefore,
different calibrations are needed at different locations with different local
environments. Unfortunately, most AirBoxes are not close to EPA stations,
making the calibration task challenging. In this article, we propose a spatial
model with spatially varying coefficients to account for heteroscedasticity in
the data. Our method gives adaptive calibrations of AirBoxes according to their
local conditions and provides accurate PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations at any

proposed method automatically calibrates measurements from a new AirBox once it
is added to the network. We illustrate our approach using hourly PM$_{2.5}$
data in the year 2020. After the calibration, the results show that the
PM$_{2.5}$ prediction improves about 37% to 67% in root mean-squared prediction

these techniques are trained using annotated content from previous crises. In
this paper, we investigate how this prior knowledge can be best leveraged for
new crises by examining the extent to which crisis events of a similar type are
more suitable for adaptation to new events (cross-domain adaptation). Given the
recent successes of transformers in various language processing tasks, we
propose CAST: an approach for Crisis domain Adaptation leveraging
Sequence-to-sequence Transformers. We evaluate CAST using two major
crisis-related message classification datasets. Our experiments show that our
CAST-based best run without using any target data achieves the state of the art
performance in both in-domain and cross-domain contexts. Moreover, CAST is
particularly effective in one-to-one cross-domain adaptation when trained with
a larger language model. In many-to-one adaptation where multiple crises are
jointly used as the source domain, CAST further improves its performance. In
addition, we find that more similar events are more likely to bring better
adaptation performance whereas fine-tuning using dissimilar events does not
help for adaptation. To aid reproducibility, we open source our code to the

optimization problem that involves fitting a (probabilistic) surrogate model to

consequently maximizing an acquisition function using a surrogate model to

outgassing of Earth and terrestrial planets. Yet formation of such atmospheres
depends on volatile exchange with the molten interior, governed by volatile
solubilities and redox reactions. We determine the evolution of magma
ocean--atmosphere systems for a range of oxygen fugacities, C/H ratios and
hydrogen budgets that include redox reactions for hydrogen (H$_2$--H$_2$O),
carbon (CO--CO$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), and solubility laws for H$_2$O and
CO$_2$. We find that small initial budgets of hydrogen, high C/H ratios, and
oxidizing conditions, suppress outgassing of hydrogen until the late stage of
magma ocean crystallization. Hence early atmospheres in equilibrium with magma
oceans are dominantly carbon-rich, and specifically CO-rich except at the most
oxidizing conditions. The high solubility of H$_2$O limits its outgassing to
melt fractions below $\sim$30\%, the fraction at which the mantle transitions
from vigorous to sluggish convection with melt percolation. Sluggish melt
percolation could enable a surface lid to form, trapping water in the interior
and thereby maintaining a carbon-rich atmosphere (equilibrium crystallization).
Alternatively, efficient crystal settling could maintain a molten surface,
promoting a transition to a water-rich atmosphere (fractional crystallization).
However, additional processes, including melt trapping and H dissolution in
crystallizing minerals, further conspire to limit the extent of H outgassing,
even for fractional crystallization. Hence, much of the water delivered to
planets during their accretion can be safely harbored in their interiors during
the magma ocean stage, particularly at oxidizing conditions.

applications (i.e. disease diagnosis). It is very challenging partly due to the
inaccessibility of uncertainty groundtruth in most datasets. Previous works
proposed to estimate the uncertainty from softmax calibration, Monte Carlo
sampling, subjective logic and so on. However, these existing methods tend to
be over-confident about their predictions with unreasonably low overall
uncertainty, which originates from the imbalance between positive (correct
classifications) and negative (incorrect classifications) samples. For this
issue, we firstly propose the distributional imbalance to model the imbalance
in uncertainty estimation as two kinds of distribution biases, and secondly
propose Balanced True Class Probability (BTCP) framework, which learns an
uncertainty estimator with a novel Distributional Focal Loss (DFL) objective.
Finally, we evaluate the BTCP in terms of failure prediction and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on multiple datasets. The experimental

rapid developments in satellite technologies in terms of satellite
miniaturization and reusable rocket launch, as well as the increased number of
nanosatellite constellations in lower orbits for space downstream applications,
such as earth observation, remote sensing, and Internet of Things (IoT) data
collection. Specifically, space-based Internet providers, such as Starlink,
OneWeb, and SES O3b, can be utilized for broadband connectivity directly
to/from the nanosatellites, which allows a larger degree of connectivity in

economically efficient and eliminates the need for an excessive number of

This objective necessitates developing suitable radio access schemes and
efficient scalable space backhauling using inter-satellite links (ISLs) and
inter-orbit links (IOLs). Particularly, service-oriented radio access methods

optimal routing mechanisms over multiple ISLs and IOLs are the most essential

successively replace the main pulses, which defines their lifetime. This pulse
instability mechanism originates from a global bifurcation of the saddle-node
infinite-period type. In addition, we show that, under the influence of noise,
the stable pulses exhibit forms of behavior characteristic of excitable

equispaced pulses per round-trip we show that if the location of the pulses

examples, a large number of defense techniques have been proposed to alleviate
this problem in recent years. However, the progress of building more robust
models is usually hampered by the incomplete or incorrect robustness
evaluation. To accelerate the research on reliable evaluation of adversarial
robustness of the current defense models in image classification, the TSAIL
group at Tsinghua University and the Alibaba Security group organized this
competition along with a CVPR 2021 workshop on adversarial machine learning
(https://aisecure-workshop.github.io/amlcvpr2021/). The purpose of this
competition is to motivate novel attack algorithms to evaluate adversarial
robustness more effectively and reliably. The participants were encouraged to
develop stronger white-box attack algorithms to find the worst-case robustness
of different defenses. This competition was conducted on an adversarial
robustness evaluation platform -- ARES (https://github.com/thu-ml/ares), and is
held on the TianChi platform
(https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/531847/introduction) as one of
the series of AI Security Challengers Program. After the competition, we
summarized the results and established a new adversarial robustness benchmark
at https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ares-bench/, which allows users to upload
adversarial attack algorithms and defense models for evaluation.

sensing and statistical learning where one exploits forms of sparsity and
structure to reduce the memory and/or computational complexity of the learning
task. In this paper, we look at the independent component analysis (ICA) model
through the compressive learning lens. In particular, we show that solutions to
the cumulant based ICA model have particular structure that induces a low
dimensional model set that resides in the cumulant tensor space. By showing a
restricted isometry property holds for random cumulants e.g. Gaussian
ensembles, we prove the existence of a compressive ICA scheme. Thereafter, we
propose two algorithms of the form of an iterative projection gradient (IPG)
and an alternating steepest descent (ASD) algorithm for compressive ICA, where
the order of compression asserted from the restricted isometry property is
realised through empirical results. We provide analysis of the CICA algorithms
including the effects of finite samples. The effects of compression are
characterised by a trade-off between the sketch size and the statistical
efficiency of the ICA estimates. By considering synthetic and real datasets, we
show the substantial memory gains achieved over well-known ICA algorithms by
using one of the proposed CICA algorithms. Finally, we conclude the paper with
open problems including interesting challenges from the emerging field of

accounts for the effect of the warm and cold seasons. The well-posedness of the
model is firstly given, its long-term dynamical behaviours are investigated and
depend on the generalized eigenvalues of the corresponding linear operator. For
the spatial-independent WNv model with seasonal succession, the generalized
eigenvalues are calculated and new properties are found. For the WNv nonlocal

then develop the indexes to the case with the free boundary and further use
these indexes to judge whether spreading or vanishing happens. The criteria
extends known results for the case with the nonlocal diffusion and the case
with the free boundary. Moreover, the generalized eigenvalues reveal that there
exists positive correlation between the duration of the warm season and the
risk of infection. The index of the nonlocal free boundary problem, which
depends on the time $t$, determines the spreading or vanishing of WNv.
Moreover, the initial infection length, the initial infection scale and the
spreading ability to the new area play an important role for the long time

propose FlexConv, a novel convolutional operation with which high bandwidth
convolutional kernels of learnable kernel size can be learned at a fixed

pooling, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several sequential datasets,
outperform recent works with learned kernel sizes, and are competitive with
much deeper ResNets on image benchmark datasets. Additionally, FlexNets can be
deployed at higher resolutions than those seen during training. To avoid
aliasing, we propose a novel kernel parameterization with which the frequency
of the kernels can be analytically controlled. Our novel kernel
parameterization shows higher descriptive power and faster convergence speed
than existing parameterizations. This leads to important improvements in
classification accuracy.

for three decades a building block of the concordance or standard $\Lambda$CDM
model of cosmology. Although the latter is not free of fundamental problems, it
provides a good phenomenological description of the overall cosmological
observations. However, an interesting improvement in such a phenomenological
description and also a change in the theoretical status of the $\Lambda$-term
occurs upon realizing that the vacuum energy density, $\rho_{\textrm{vac}}$, is
actually a ""running quantity"" in quantum field theory in curved spacetime.
Several works have shown that this option can compete with the $\Lambda$CDM
with a rigid $\Lambda$term. The so-called, ""running vacuum models"" (RVM) are
characterized indeed by a $\rho_{\textrm{vac}}$ which is evolving with time as
a series of even powers of the Hubble parameter and its time derivatives. This
form has been motivated by renormalization group arguments in previous works.
Here we review a recent detailed computation by the authors of the renormalized
energy-momentum tensor of a non-minimally coupled scalar field with the help of
adiabatic regularization. The final result is noteworthy:
$\rho_{\textrm{vac}}(H)$ takes the precise structure of the RVM, namely a
constant term plus a dynamical component $\sim H^2$ (which may be detectable in
the present universe) including also higher order effects $\mathcal{O}(H^4)$
which can be of interest during the early stages of the cosmological evolution.
Besides, it is most remarkable that such renormalized form of
$\rho_{\textrm{vac}}$ does not carry dangerous terms proportional to $m^4$, the
quartic powers of the masses of the fields, which are a well-known source of
exceedingly large contributions to the vacuum energy density and are directly
responsible for fine tuning in the context of the CC problem.

programming language coupled to a powerful experimental design engine, which
together automate sequential experimental design for approximating a (possibly
nonlinear) quantity of interest in Gaussian processes models. Using a handful
of commands, GaussED can be used to: solve linear partial differential
equations, perform tomographic reconstruction from integral data and implement

the neutron star because of the centrifugal barrier and irradiation of the
outer disc and companion star by X-rays from the neutron star and disc. When
setting inner boundary conditions, we take into account that processes at the

explained by a radial shrinking of the hot disc. At the same time, models with

J1617-5055. Parkes Observatory 3 GHz radio observations of the pulsar (taken
about 7 years before the NuSTAR observations) are also reported here. NuSTAR
detected pulsations at a frequency of $f\approx14.4$ Hz ($P\approx69.44$ ms)
and, in addition, the observation was long enough to measure the source's
frequency derivative, $\dot{f}\approx-2.8\times10^{-11}$ Hz s$^{-1}$. We find
that the pulsar shows one peak per period at both hard X-ray and radio
wavelengths, but that the hard X-ray pulse is broader (having a duty cycle of
$\sim 0.7$), than the radio pulse (having a duty cycle of $\sim 0.08$).
Additionally, the radio pulse is strongly linearly polarized. J1617's
phase-integrated hard X-ray spectrum is well fit by an absorbed power-law
model, with a photon index $\Gamma=1.59\pm 0.02$. The hard X-ray pulsations are
well described by three Fourier harmonics, and have a pulsed fraction that
increases with energy. We also fit the phase-resolved NuSTAR spectra with an
absorbed power-law model in five phase bins and find that the photon index
varies with phase from $\Gamma = 1.52\pm 0.03$ at phases around the flux
maximum to $\Gamma=1.79\pm 0.06$ around the flux minimum. Lastly, we compare
our results with other pulsars whose magnetospheric emission is detected at

X-ray properties are more similar to the MeV pulsars than the GeV pulsars.

including images, sets, point clouds, and graphs. In this paper, we consider
invariant and equivariant networks for symmetries of finite groups. Invariant
and equivariant networks have been constructed by various researchers using
Reynolds operators. However, Reynolds operators are computationally expensive
when the order of the group is large because they use the sum over the whole
group, which poses an implementation difficulty. To overcome this difficulty,
we consider representing the Reynolds operator as a sum over a subset instead
of a sum over the whole group. We call such a subset a Reynolds design, and an
operator defined by a sum over a Reynolds design a reductive Reynolds operator.
For example, in the case of a graph with $n$ nodes, the computational
complexity of the reductive Reynolds operator is reduced to $O(n^2)$, while the
computational complexity of the Reynolds operator is $O(n!)$. We construct
learning models based on the reductive Reynolds operator called equivariant and
invariant Reynolds networks (ReyNets) and prove that they have universal
approximation property. Reynolds designs for equivariant ReyNets are derived
from combinatorial observations with Young diagrams, while Reynolds designs for
invariant ReyNets are derived from invariants called Reynolds dimensions
defined on the set of invariant polynomials. Numerical experiments show that
the performance of our models is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

which evaporation of metals and outgassing of C- and H-bearing volatiles
produced an early atmosphere. Atmospheric escape subsequently occurred by
plasma heating, photoevaporation, Jeans escape, and photoionization. To
quantify atmospheric loss, we combine constraints on the lifetime of surficial
melt, melt composition, and atmospheric composition. Consideration of two
initial Mercury sizes and four magma ocean compositions determine the
atmospheric speciation at a given surface temperature. A coupled
interior-atmosphere model determines the cooling rate and therefore the
lifetime of surficial melt. Combining the melt lifetime and escape flux
calculations provide estimates for the total mass loss from early Mercury. Loss
rates by Jeans escape are negligible. Plasma heating and photoionization are
limited by homopause diffusion rates of $\sim10^{6}$ kg/s. Loss by
photoevaporation depends on the timing of Mercury formation and assumed heating
efficiency and ranges from $\sim10^{6.6}$ to $\sim10^{9.6}$ kg/s. The material
for photoevaporation is sourced from below the homopause and is therefore
energy-limited rather than diffusion-limited. The timescale for efficient
interior-atmosphere chemical exchange is less than ten thousand years.
Therefore, escape processes only account for an equivalent loss of less than
2.3 km of crust ($0.3\%$ of Mercury's mass). Accordingly, $\leq0.02\%$ of the
total mass of H$_2$O and Na is lost. Therefore, cumulative loss cannot
significantly modify Mercury's bulk mantle composition during the magma ocean
stage. Mercury's high core:mantle ratio and volatile-rich surface may instead
reflect chemical variations in its building blocks resulting from its
solar-proximal accretion environment.

to its simple concept, fast dynamic response, and good reference tracking.
However, it suffers from parametric uncertainties, since it directly relies on
the mathematical model of the system to predict the optimal switching states to
be used at the next sampling time. As a result, uncertain parameters lead to an
ill-designed MPC. Thus, this paper offers a model-free control strategy on the
basis of artificial neural networks (ANNs), for mitigating the effects of
parameter mismatching while having a little negative impact on the inverter's
performance. This method includes two related stages. First, MPC is used as an
expert to control the studied converter in order to provide a dataset, while,
in the second stage, the obtained dataset is utilized to train the proposed
ANN. The case study herein is based on a four-level three-cell flying capacitor
inverter. In this study, MATLAB/Simulink is used to simulate the performance of
the proposed method, taking into account various operating conditions.
Afterward, the simulation results are reported in comparison with the
conventional MPC scheme, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed
control strategy in terms of robustness against parameters mismatch and low
total harmonic distortion (THD), especially when changes occur in the system
parameters, compared to the conventional MPC. Furthermore, the experimental
validation of the proposed method is provided based on the Hardware-in-the-Loop

withdrawing cash. The European Central Bank reported more than 11 billion cash
withdrawals and loading/unloading transactions on the European ATMs in 2019.
Although ATMs have undergone various technological evolutions, Personal
Identification Numbers (PINs) are still the most common authentication method
for these devices. Unfortunately, the PIN mechanism is vulnerable to
shoulder-surfing attacks performed via hidden cameras installed near the ATM to
catch the PIN pad. To overcome this problem, people get used to covering the
typing hand with the other hand. While such users probably believe this
behavior is safe enough to protect against mentioned attacks, there is no clear
assessment of this countermeasure in the scientific literature.
  This paper proposes a novel attack to reconstruct PINs entered by victims
covering the typing hand with the other hand. We consider the setting where the
attacker can access an ATM PIN pad of the same brand/model as the target one.
Afterward, the attacker uses that model to infer the digits pressed by the
victim while entering the PIN. Our attack owes its success to a carefully
selected deep learning architecture that can infer the PIN from the typing hand
position and movements. We run a detailed experimental analysis including 58
users. With our approach, we can guess 30% of the 5-digit PINs within three
attempts -- the ones usually allowed by ATM before blocking the card. We also
conducted a survey with 78 users that managed to reach an accuracy of only
7.92% on average for the same setting. Finally, we evaluate a shielding
countermeasure that proved to be rather inefficient unless the whole keypad is
shielded.

time series of noisy information about the spread. Initially, there is a single
vertex affected by the cascade (the source) and the cascade spreads in discrete
time steps across the network. The cascade evolution is hidden, but one can
observe a time series of noisy signals from each vertex. The time series of a
vertex is assumed to be a sequence of i.i.d. samples from a pre-change
distribution $Q_0$ before the cascade affects the vertex, and the time series
is a sequence of i.i.d. samples from a post-change distribution $Q_1$ once the
cascade has affected the vertex. Given the time series of noisy signals, which
can be viewed as a noisy measurement of the cascade evolution, we aim to devise
a procedure to reliably estimate the cascade source as fast as possible.
  We investigate Bayesian and minimax formulations of the source estimation
problem, and derive near-optimal estimators for simple cascade dynamics and
network topologies. In the Bayesian setting, an estimator which observes
samples until the error of the Bayes-optimal estimator falls below a threshold
achieves optimal performance. In the minimax setting, optimal performance is
achieved by designing a novel multi-hypothesis sequential probability ratio
test (MSPRT). We find that these optimal estimators require $\log \log n / \log
(k - 1)$ observations of the noisy time series when the network topology is a
$k$-regular tree, and $(\log n)^{\frac{1}{\ell + 1}}$ observations are required
for $\ell$-dimensional lattices. Finally, we discuss how our methods may be
extended to cascades on arbitrary graphs.

Microquasars (HMMQs) are useful labs to study such jets, as they are relatively
close and evolve over observable time scales. The ambient medium into which the
jet propagates is, however, far from homogeneous. Corresponding simulation
studies to date consider various forms of a wind-shaped ambient medium but
typically neglect radiative cooling and relativistic effects. Aims. We
investigate the dynamical and structural effects of radiative losses and system
parameters on relativistic jets in HMMQs, from the jet launch to its
propagation over several tens of orbital separations. Methods. We use 3D
relativistic hydrodynamical simulations including parameterized radiative
cooling derived from relativistic thermal plasma distribution to carry out
parameter studies around two fiducial cases inspired by Cygnus X-1 and Cygnus
X-3. Results. Radiative losses are found to be more relevant in Cygnus X-3 than
Cygnus X-1. Varying jet power, jet temperature, or the wind of the donor star
tends to have a larger impact at early times, when the jet forms and
instabilities initially develop, than at later times when the jet has reached a
turbulent state. Conclusions. Radiative losses may be dynamically and
structurally relevant at least in Cygnus X-3 case, and thus should be examined

conversational AI. The current best conversational models, which are either
good chit-chatters (e.g., BlenderBot) or goal-oriented systems (e.g., MinTL),
are language models (LMs) fine-tuned on large conversational datasets. Training
these models is expensive, both in terms of computational resources and time,
and it is hard to keep them up to date with new conversational skills. A simple
yet unexplored solution is prompt-based few-shot learning (Brown et al. 2020)
which does not require gradient-based fine-tuning but instead uses a few
examples in the LM context as the only source of learning. In this paper, we
explore prompt-based few-shot learning in dialogue tasks. We benchmark LMs of
different sizes in nine response generation tasks, which include four
knowledge-grounded tasks, a task-oriented generations task, three open-chat
tasks, and controlled stylistic generation, and five conversational parsing
tasks, which include dialogue state tracking, graph path generation, persona
information extraction, document retrieval, and internet query generation. The
current largest released LM (GPT-J-6B) using prompt-based few-shot learning,

few-shot classifier, that also does not require any fine-tuning, to select the
most appropriate prompt given a dialogue history. Finally, by combining the
power of prompt-based few-shot learning and a Skill Selector, we create an
end-to-end chatbot named the Few-Shot Bot (FSB), which automatically selects
the most appropriate conversational skill, queries different knowledge bases or
the internet, and uses the retrieved knowledge to generate a human-like

7025 indicate that the stars that form its bulge have supersolar metallicity
and considerably old ages (\sim 10 Gyr), in general. We determined that the
bulge of NGC 7025 has a mild negative mass-weighted age gradient using three
different combinations of MEGARA spectral setups. Regarding its more detailed
star formation history, our results indicate that, besides a rather constant
star formation at early epochs, a peak in formation history of the stars in the

this overhead is to perform multiple unsynchronized SGD steps independently on

at a price: lower communication costs (and thereby faster training) are
accompanied by lower accuracy. This finding is in contrast from the
smaller-scale experiments in prior work, suggesting that local SGD encounters
challenges at scale. We further show that incorporating the slow momentum

Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) has been designed to be fast and precise in the
presence of non-malicious interference and noise. A smart jammer might exploit
this weakness and may launch an attack during the BA phase in order to degrade
the accuracy of beam selection and, thus, adversely impacting the end-to-end
performance and quality-of-service experienced by the users. In this paper, we
study the effects of a jamming attack at MMW frequencies during the BA

randomly corrupting the probing sequence transmitted by the BS in order to
reject the jamming signal at the UE via a subspace-based technique based on
orthogonal projections and jamming cancellation. Numerical results corroborate

demand response. Substantial potential for demand response is offered by
flexible processes and their local multi-energy supply systems. Simultaneous
optimization of their schedules can exploit the demand response potential, but
leads to numerically challenging problems for nonlinear dynamic processes. In
this paper, we propose to capture process dynamics using dynamic ramping
constraints. In contrast to traditional static ramping constraints, dynamic
ramping constraints are a function of the process state and can capture
high-order dynamics. We derive dynamic ramping constraints rigorously for the
case of single-input single-output processes that are exactly input-state
linearizable. The resulting scheduling problem can be efficiently solved as a
mixed-integer linear program. In a case study, we study two flexible reactors
and a multi-energy system. The proper representation of process dynamics by
dynamic ramping allows for faster transitions compared to static ramping
constraints and thus higher economic benefits of demand response. The proposed
dynamic ramping approach is sufficiently fast for application in online
optimization.

side-channel attacks. Recently proposed defenses have their own caveats:
Randomization-based defenses are vulnerable to the evolving attack algorithms
besides relying on weak cryptographic primitives, because they do not
fundamentally address the root cause for cache side-channel attacks. Cache
partitioning defenses, on the other hand, provide the strict resource
partitioning and effectively block all side-channel threats. However, they
usually rely on way-based partitioning which is not fine-grained and cannot
scale to support a larger number of protection domains, e.g., in trusted
execution environment (TEE) security architectures, besides degrading
performance and often resulting in cache underutilization.
  To overcome the shortcomings of both approaches, we present a novel and
flexible set-associative cache partitioning design for TEE architectures,
called Chunked-Cache. Chunked-Cache enables an execution context to ""carve"" out
an exclusive configurable chunk of the cache if the execution requires
side-channel resilience. If side-channel resilience is not required, mainstream
cache resources are freely utilized. Hence, our solution addresses the
security-performance trade-off practically by enabling selective and on-demand
utilization of side-channel-resilient caches, while providing well-grounded
future-proof security guarantees. We show that Chunked-Cache provides
side-channel-resilient cache utilization for sensitive code execution, with
small hardware overhead, while incurring no performance overhead on the OS. We
also show that it outperforms conventional way-based cache partitioning by 43%,
while scaling significantly better to support a larger number of protection
domains.

challenging task, and current methods synthesize images from text in a
multi-stage manner, typically by first generating a rough initial image and
then refining image details at subsequent stages. However, existing methods
that follow this paradigm suffer from three important limitations. Firstly,
they synthesize initial images without attempting to separate image attributes
at a word-level. As a result, object attributes of initial images (that provide
a basis for subsequent refinement) are inherently entangled and ambiguous in
nature. Secondly, by using common text-representations for all regions, current
methods prevent us from interpreting text in fundamentally different ways at
different parts of an image. Different image regions are therefore only allowed
to assimilate the same type of information from text at each refinement stage.
Finally, current methods generate refinement features only once at each
refinement stage and attempt to address all image aspects in a single shot.
This single-shot refinement limits the precision with which each refinement
stage can learn to improve the prior image. Our proposed method introduces
three novel components to address these shortcomings: (1) An initial generation
stage that explicitly generates separate sets of image features for each word
n-gram. (2) A spatial dynamic memory module for refinement of images. (3) An
iterative multi-headed mechanism to make it easier to improve upon multiple
image aspects. Experimental results demonstrate that our Multi-Headed Spatial

anchored extra-gradient scheme in [70] based on Popov's past extra-gradient
method to solve a maximally monotone equation $G(x) = 0$. We show that our
method achieves the same $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ convergence rate (up to a constant

where $k$ is the iteration counter. Next, we develop two splitting algorithms
to approximate a zero point of the sum of two maximally monotone operators. The
first algorithm originates from the anchored extra-gradient method combining
with a splitting technique, while the second one is its Popov's variant which
can reduce the per-iteration complexity. Both algorithms appear to be new and

(CU-distributed) system, while also smoothly converging. Our results show that
our CU-distributed system provides 1.3- to 1.8-fold network throughput compared
to the DU-distributed system, with minor increases in complexity and front-haul
load - and substantial gains over benchmark schemes like local zero-forcing. We
also analyze the trade-offs provided by the CU-distributed system, hence
highlighting the significance of deploying multiple CUs in user-centric
cell-free networks.

detector-level effects which distort astronomical images can contaminate the
inferred shear. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will fly a focal
plane with 18 Teledyne H4RG-10 near infrared (IR) detector arrays; these have
never been used for weak lensing and they present unique instrument calibration
challenges. A pair of previous investigations (Hirata & Choi 2020; Choi &
Hirata 2020) demonstrated that spatiotemporal correlations of flat fields can
effectively separate the brighter-fatter effect (BFE) and interpixel
capacitance (IPC). Later work (Freudenburg et al. 2020) introduced a
Fourier-space treatment of these correlations which allowed the authors to
expand to higher orders in BFE, IPC, and classical nonlinearity (CNL). This
work expands the previous formalism to include quantum yield and charge
diffusion. We test the updated formalism on simulations and show that we can
recover input characterization values. We then apply the formalism to visible
and IR flat field data from three Roman flight candidate detectors. We fit a 2D
Gaussian model to the charge diffusion at 0.5 $\mu$m wavelength, and find
variances of $C_{11} = 0.1066\pm 0.0011$ pix$^2$ in the horizontal direction,
$C_{22} = 0.1136\pm 0.0012$ pix$^2$ in the vertical direction, and a covariance
of $C_{12} = 0.0001\pm 0.0007$ pix$^2$ (stat) for SCA 20829. Last, we convert
the asymmetry of the charge diffusion into an equivalent shear signal, and find
a contamination of the shear correlation function to be $\xi_+ \sim 10^{-6}$
for each detector. This exceeds Roman's allotted error budget for the
measurement by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ in power (amplitude squared) but
can likely be mitigated through standard methods for fitting the point spread
function (PSF) since charge diffusion can be treated as a contribution to the
PSF.

shrinking or by rotating as a rigid object to coalesce with an adjacent grain.
Here we report a third mechanism for grain coarsening, in which a grain splits
apart into two regions that rotate in opposite directions to match two adjacent
grains' orientations. We experimentally observe both conventional grain
rotation and grain splitting in 2D colloidal polycrystals. We find that grain
splitting occurs via independently rotating ""granules"" whose shapes are
determined by the underlying triangular lattices of the two merging crystal
grains. These granules are so small that existing continuum theories of grain
boundary energy are inapplicable, so we introduce a hard sphere model for the
free energy of a colloidal polycrystal. We find that during splitting, the
system overcomes a free energy barrier before ultimately reaching a lower free
energy when splitting is complete. Using simulated splitting events and a
simple scaling prediction, we find that the barrier to grain splitting
decreases as grain size decreases. Consequently, grain splitting is likely to
play an important role in polycrystals with small grains. This discovery
suggests that mesoscale models of grain coarsening may offer better predictions
in the nanocrystalline regime by including grain splitting.

galaxy discs, often changing shape both in and out of the disc plane. In some
cases they may bend or buckle out of the disc plane resulting in the formation
of boxy/peanut/x-shape bulges. In this paper we show that the dark matter halo
shape affects bar formation and buckling. We have performed N-body simulations
of bar buckling in non-spherical dark matter halos and traced bar evolution for
8 Gyr. We find that bar formation is delayed in oblate halos, resulting in
delayed buckling whereas bars form earlier in prolate halos leading to earlier
buckling. However, the duration of first buckling remains almost comparable.
All the models show two buckling events but the most extreme prolate halo
exhibits three distinct buckling features. Bars in prolate halos also show
buckling signatures for the longest duration compared to spherical and oblate
halos. Since ongoing buckling events are rarely observed, our study suggests
that most barred galaxies may have more oblate or spherical halos rather than
prolate halos. Our measurement of BPX structures also shows that prolate halos
promote bar thickening and disc heating more than oblate and spherical halos.

abstractions without using joins, and (ii) a new abstract domain, CH-Zonotope,
which admits efficient propagation and inclusion checks while retaining high
precision. We implement our framework in a tool called CRAFT and evaluate it on
a novel fixpoint-based neural network architecture (monDEQ) that is
particularly challenging to verify. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that
CRAFT exceeds the state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed (two orders of

semi-supervised learning (SSL) benchmarks. However, like other modern SSL
algorithms, FixMatch uses a pre-defined constant threshold for all classes to
select unlabeled data that contribute to the training, thus failing to consider
different learning status and learning difficulties of different classes. To
address this issue, we propose Curriculum Pseudo Labeling (CPL), a curriculum
learning approach to leverage unlabeled data according to the model's learning
status. The core of CPL is to flexibly adjust thresholds for different classes
at each time step to let pass informative unlabeled data and their pseudo
labels. CPL does not introduce additional parameters or computations (forward
or backward propagation). We apply CPL to FixMatch and call our improved
algorithm FlexMatch. FlexMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of SSL benchmarks, with especially strong performances when the labeled
data are extremely limited or when the task is challenging. For example,
FlexMatch achieves 13.96% and 18.96% error rate reduction over FixMatch on
CIFAR-100 and STL-10 datasets respectively, when there are only 4 labels per
class. CPL also significantly boosts the convergence speed, e.g., FlexMatch can
use only 1/5 training time of FixMatch to achieve even better performance.
Furthermore, we show that CPL can be easily adapted to other SSL algorithms and
remarkably improve their performances. We open-source our code at

challenging task for graph analysis. Recently, methods based on graph
contrastive learning (GCL) have obtained impressive clustering performance on
this task. Yet, we observe that existing GCL-based methods 1) fail to benefit
from imprecise clustering labels; 2) require a post-processing operation to get
clustering labels; 3) cannot solve out-of-sample (OOS) problem. To address
these issues, we propose a novel attributed graph clustering network, namely
Self-supervised Contrastive Attributed Graph Clustering (SCAGC). In SCAGC, by
leveraging inaccurate clustering labels, a self-supervised contrastive loss,
which aims to maximize the similarities of intra-cluster nodes while minimizing
the similarities of inter-cluster nodes, are designed for node representation
learning. Meanwhile, a clustering module is built to directly output clustering
labels by contrasting the representation of different clusters. Thus, for the
OOS nodes, SCAGC can directly calculate their clustering labels. Extensive
experimental results on four benchmark datasets have shown that SCAGC
consistently outperforms 11 competitive clustering methods.

effectively learn individual's hidden personalized preferences to her visited
places, the interactions among users can only be weakly learned through the
representations of locations. Targeting this, we propose an end-to-end
framework named personalized and group preference guided network (PG$^2$Net),
considering the users' preferences to various places at both individual and
collective levels. Specifically, PG$^2$Net concatenates Bi-LSTM and attention
mechanism to capture each user's long-term mobility tendency. To learn
population's group preferences, we utilize spatial and temporal information of
the visitations to construct a spatio-temporal dependency module. We adopt a
graph embedding method to map users' trajectory into a hidden space, capturing
their sequential relation. In addition, we devise an auxiliary loss to learn

intuitively explainable. This work can help educators better understand the

Using NGC 2808 as test case we show the use of well established statistical
clustering methods. We focus the analysis to the RGB phase, where two data sets
are available from recent literature for low- and high-resolution spectroscopy.
We adopt both hierarchical clustering and partition methods. We explicitly
address the usually neglected problem of measurement errors. The results of the
clustering algorithms were subjected to silhouette width analysis to compare
the performance of the split into different number of MP. For both data sets
the results are at odd with those reported in the literature. Two MP are
detected for both data sets, while the literature reports five and four MP from
high- and low-resolution spectroscopy respectively. The silhouette analysis
suggests that the population sub-structure is reliable for high-resolution
spectroscopy data, while the actual existence of MP is questionable for the
low-resolution spectroscopy data. The discrepancy with literature claims is
explainable due to the difference of methods adopted to MP characterisation. By
means of Monte Carlo simulations and multimodality statistical tests we show
that the often adopted study of the histogram of the differences in some key
elements is prone to multiple false positive findings. The adoption of
statistically grounded methods, which adopt all the available information to
subset the data and explicitly address the problem of data uncertainty, is of
paramount importance to present more robust and reproducible researches.

both policy instruments and technological methodologies. We begin by presenting
the carbon footprint of data centers, as well as some insights into the major

global cloud providers are discussed to summarize current industrial efforts in
this direction. In what follows, we introduce the carbon market as a policy
instrument to explain how to offset data center carbon emissions in a

carbon-neutral data centers by increasing renewable energy penetration,
improving energy efficiency, and boosting energy circulation simultaneously. A
comprehensive review of existing technologies on these three topics is
elaborated subsequently. Based on this, a multi-pronged approach towards carbon

mechanics where the Navier-Stokes and Navier-Lam\'e equations become
approximations of the equation of discrete motion. It unifies the fields of
fluid and solid mechanics by extending the fields of application of these
equations to all space and time scales. This article presents the essential
differences induced by the abandonment of the notion of continuous medium and
global frame of reference. The results of the mechanics of continuous medium
validated by fluid and solid observations are not questioned. The concept of
continuous medium is not invalidated, the discrete formulation proposed simply
widens the spectrum of the applications of the classical equations.
  The discrete equation of motion introduces several important modifications,
in particular the fundamental law of the dynamics on an element of volume
becomes a law of conservation of the accelerations on an edge. The acceleration
considered as an absolute quantity is written as a sum of two components, one
soledoidal the other irrotational according to a local orthogonal
Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition. The mass is abandoned and replaced by the
compression and rotation energies represented by the scalar and vectorial
potentials of the acceleration. The equation of motion and all the physical
parameters are expressed only with two fundamental units, those of length and
time. The essential differences between the two approaches are listed and some
of them are discussed in depth. This is particularly the case with the known
paradoxes of the Navier-Stokes equation or the importance of inertia for the

RFDA-FM for flow maps from one origin to multiple destinations using a river
extraction algorithm in digital elevation models (DEM). The RFDA-FM first
models the mapping space as a flat surface by a DEM. A maze-solving algorithm
(MSA) for river extraction is then adapted to calculate the flow path from one
destination to the origin by constraining its searching directions, direction
weights, and searching ranges according to the quality criteria of flow maps.
All flow paths from the destinations to the origin are obtained iteratively
based on the MSA according to their importance, which is defined by considering
their length. Finally, these paths are smoothly rendered with varying widths
according to their volume using B\'ezier curves. A comparison with existing
approaches indicates that the flow maps generated by RFDA-FM can be better at
keeping nodes away from edges without node overlaps and edge crosses. Two

verify product conformance to the requirements and specifications. Standardized
quality control ensures that all the products are evaluated under the same

digitalization of manufacturing and provided greater data availability. Such
data availability has spurred the development of artificial intelligence
models, which allow higher degrees of automation and reduced bias when
inspecting the products. Furthermore, the increased speed of inspection reduces
overall costs and time required for defect inspection. In this research, we
compare five streaming machine learning algorithms applied to visual defect
inspection with real-world data provided by Philips Consumer Lifestyle BV.
Furthermore, we compare them in a streaming active learning context, which
reduces the data labeling effort in a real-world context. Our results show that
active learning reduces the data labeling effort by almost 15% on average for
the worst case, while keeping an acceptable classification performance. The use
of machine learning models for automated visual inspection are expected to
speed up the quality inspection up to 40%.

not only the user's characteristics, but also the social situation of the user.
Existing work on including social context uses some type of situation cue as an
input to information processing techniques in order to assess the expected
behavior of the user. However, research shows that it is important to also
determine the meaning of a situation, a step which we refer to as social
situation comprehension. We propose using psychological characteristics of
situations, which have been proposed in social science for ascribing meaning to
situations, as the basis for social situation comprehension. Using data from
user studies, we evaluate this proposal from two perspectives. First, from a
technical perspective, we show that psychological characteristics of situations
can be used as input to predict the priority of social situations, and that
psychological characteristics of situations can be predicted from the features
of a social situation. Second, we investigate the role of the comprehension
step in human-machine meaning making. We show that psychological
characteristics can be successfully used as a basis for explanations given to
users about the decisions of an agenda management personal assistant agent.

These biological properties can be presented by a two-dimensional scatter plot.
However, single-cell sequencing data generally has very high dimensionality.
Therefore, dimensionality reduction should be used to process the high
dimensional sequencing data for 2D visualization and subsequent biological
analysis. The traditional dimensionality reduction methods, which do not
consider the structure characteristics of single-cell sequencing data, are
difficult to reveal the data structure in the 2D representation. In this paper,
we develop a 2D feature representation method based on graph convolutional
networks (GCN) for the visualization of single-cell data, termed single-cell
sequencing graph embedding networks (SGEN). This method constructs the graph by
the similarity relationship between cells and adopts GCN to analyze the
neighbor embedding information of samples, which makes the similar cell closer
to each other on the 2D scatter plot. The results show SGEN achieves obvious 2D
distribution and preserves the high-dimensional relationship of different
cells. Meanwhile, similar cell clusters have spatial continuity rather than
relying heavily on random initialization, which can reflect the trajectory of
cell development in this scatter plot.

He-N2 plasma treatment of 20 min can reduce the median germination time of
lentil seeds from 1420 min to 1145 minutes, ie a gain in vigor of 275 min (or
+19.4 %). Considering that this result depends on the plasma-seed interaction
and therefore on the contact surfaces between the seeds and the plasma, a
topographic modeling of a 100 seeds-stack is performed in the dielectric
barrier device. This model drives to the distinction between the seed-seed
contact surfaces (276 contacts standing for a total area of 230.6 mm2) and the
seed-wall contact surfaces (134 contacts standing for a total area of 105.9
mm2). After a single plasma treatment, the outer envelope of each seed is 92%
exposed to plasma: a value high enough to support the relevance of the plasma
process but which also opens the way to process optimizations. In this outlook,
we propose to replace the single 20-minute plasma treatment by a ""plasma
sequence"", ie a succession of shorter plasma treatments whose total duration
remains 20 min. Between two successive plasma treatments, the seeds can follow
either a trapping procedure (seeds in same positions and orientations) or a
randomizing procedure (seeds in same positions but reoriented) or a stirring
procedure (seeds vigorously shaken). A sequence of 10 plasma treatments (upon 2
min) separated by short stirring procedures leads to a gain in vigor as high as
405 min vs 275 min for a single plasma treatment of 20 min. We propose to
understand these results by correlating the gain in vigor with the water uptake

Advances of our approach over existing SSL methods are two-fold: 1) by
incorporating prior domain knowledge into the training regime of SSL, more
semantically similar positives are discovered without accessing ground-truth
labels; 2) via investigating the influence of the temperature in contrastive
loss, an adaptive temperature mechanism for each sample according to prior

  Domain with Distributional Fitness Evaluation","An paper accepted by the Artificial Life journal",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discrete gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a vital role in the study of
robustness and modularity. A common method of evaluating the robustness of GRNs
is to measure their ability to regulate a set of perturbed gene activation
patterns back to their unperturbed forms. Usually, perturbations are obtained
by collecting random samples produced by a predefined distribution of gene
activation patterns. This sampling method introduces stochasticity, in turn
inducing dynamicity. This dynamicity is imposed on top of an already complex
fitness landscape. So where sampling is used, it is important to understand
which effects arise from the structure of the fitness landscape, and which
arise from the dynamicity imposed on it. Stochasticity of the fitness function
also causes difficulties in reproducibility and in post-experimental analyses.
  We develop a deterministic distributional fitness evaluation by considering
the complete distribution of gene activity patterns, so as to avoid
stochasticity in fitness assessment. This fitness evaluation facilitates
repeatability. Its determinism permits us to ascertain theoretical bounds on
the fitness, and thus to identify whether the algorithm has reached a global
optimum. It enables us to differentiate the effects of the problem domain from
those of the noisy fitness evaluation, and thus to resolve two remaining
anomalies in the behaviour of the problem domain
of~\citet{espinosa2010specialization}. We also reveal some properties of
solution GRNs that lead them to be robust and modular, leading to a deeper
understanding of the nature of the problem domain. We conclude by discussing
potential directions toward simulating and understanding the emergence of
modularity in larger, more complex domains, which is key both to generating
more useful modular solutions, and to understanding the ubiquity of modularity
in biological systems.

patients, including determining if a patient is likely to have permanent or
non-permanent injuries or ailments. An independent medical examination (IME)
report summarizes a physicians medical opinion about a patients health status
based on the physicians expertise. IME reports contain private and sensitive
information (Personally Identifiable Information or PII) that needs to be
removed or randomly encoded before further research work can be conducted. In
our study the IME is an orthopedic surgeon from a private practice in the
United States. The goal of this research is to perform named entity recognition
(NER) to identify and subsequently remove/encode PII information from IME
reports prepared by the physician. We apply the NER toolkits of OpenNLP and
spaCy, two freely available natural language processing platforms, and compare
their precision, recall, and f-measure performance at identifying five
categories of PII across trials of randomly selected IME reports using each
models common default parameters. We find that both platforms achieve high
performance (f-measure > 0.9) at de-identification and that a spaCy model
trained with a 70-30 train-test data split is most performant.

emergency medical services, regardless of the operating scenario. Thus,
reliable estimates of the time to the critical condition, under which there
will be no available servers to respond the next incoming call, become very
useful measures of the system's performance. In this contribution, we develop a
key performance indicator by providing an explicit formula for the average time
to the shortage condition. Our analytical expression for this average time is a
function of the number of parallel servers and the inter-arrival and service
times. We assume exponential distributions of times in our analytical
expression but for evaluating the mean first-passage time to the critical
condition under more realistic scenarios we validate our result through
exhaustive simulations with lognormal service time distributions. For this task
we have implemented an simulator in $R$. Our results indicate that our
analytical formula is an acceptable approximation under any situation of
practical interest.

  Systems","This work has been submitted to ACC2022",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The essence of distributed computing systems is how to schedule incoming
requests and how to allocate all computing nodes to minimize both time and
computation costs. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware optimal scheduling
and allocation strategy for distributed computing systems while minimizing the
cost function including response time and service cost. First, based on the
proposed cost function, we derive the optimal request scheduling policy and the
optimal resource allocation policy synchronously. Second, considering the
effects of incoming requests on the scheduling policy, the additive increase
multiplicative decrease (AIMD) mechanism is implemented to model the relation
between the request arrival and scheduling. In particular, the AIMD parameters
can be designed such that the derived optimal strategy is still valid. Finally,
a numerical example is presented to illustrate the derived results.
