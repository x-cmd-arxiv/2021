interactions between a virus and a substrate. Our model treats the virus as a
homogeneous particle having surface charge and the polymer fiber of the
respirator as a charged plane. Electric potentials surrounding the virus and
fiber are influenced by the surface charge distribution of the virus. We use
Poisson-Boltzmann equations to calculate electric potentials. Then, Derjaguin's
approximation and a linear superposition of the potential function are extended
to determine the electrostatic force. In this work, we apply this model for
coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 case and numerical results quantitatively agree with
prior simulation. We find that the influence of fiber's potential on the
surface charge of the virus is important and is considered in interaction
calculations to obtain better accuracy. The electrostatic interaction
significantly decays with increasing separation distance, and this curve
becomes steeper when adding more salt. Although the interaction force increases
with heating, one can observe the repulsive-attractive transition when the
environment is acidic.

preventing the conversion of formic acid into CO2. The (bio)chemical conversion
of formic acid to CO2 is a key reaction. Therefore, we compared the growth of
BL21, being a subfamily of K12, alongside two strains in which two different
genes related to the formate metabolism were deleted, in complex and simple
media. Experimental results were entirely consistent with metabolic
predictions. Subsequently, the knockout bacteria grew more efficiently than
BL21. Interestingly, TsFDH, a formate dehydrogenase with the tendency of
converting CO2 to formate, increased the growth of all strains compared with
cells without the TsFDH. Most mutants grew in a simple medium containing
glycerol, which showed that glycerol is the preferred carbon source compared to
glucose for the growth of E. coli. These results explain the reasons for the
inconsistency of predictions in previous metabolic models that declared
glycerol as a suitable carbon source for the growth of E. coli but failed to
achieve it in practice. To conduct a more mechanistic evaluation of our
observations, RNA sequencing data analysis was conducted on an E. coli RNA-seq

predict the instantaneous steering angle directly from images of the
ahead-lying street. These learners must provide reliable uncertainty estimates
for their predictions in order to meet safety requirements and initiate a
switch to manual control in areas of high uncertainty. Yet end-to-end learners
typically only deliver point predictions, since distributional predictions are
associated with large increases in training time or additional computational
resources during prediction. To address this shortcoming we investigate
efficient and scalable approximate inference for the implicit copula neural
linear model of Klein, Nott and Smith (2021) in order to quantify uncertainty
for the predictions of end-to-end learners. The result are densities for the
steering angle that are marginally calibrated, i.e.~the average of the
estimated densities equals the empirical distribution of steering angles. To
ensure the scalability to large $n$ regimes, we develop efficient estimation
based on variational inference as a fast alternative to computationally
intensive, exact inference via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the
accuracy and speed of the variational approach in comparison to Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo on two end-to-end learners trained for highway driving using the
comma2k19 data set. The implicit copula neural linear model delivers accurate
calibration, high-quality prediction intervals and allows to identify
overconfident learners. Our approach also contributes to the explainability of
black-box end-to-end learners, since predictive densities can be used to
understand which steering actions the end-to-end learner sees as valid.

We investigate the predictive accuracy of treeging across a thorough and widely

ordinary kriging, random forest and ensembles of ordinary kriging base
learners. Treeging performs well across the board, whereas kriging suffers when
dependence is weak or in the presence of spurious covariates, and random forest
suffers when the covariates are less informative. Treeging also outperforms
these competitors in predicting atmospheric pollutants (ozone and PM$_{2.5}$)
in several case studies. We examine sensitivity to tuning parameters (number of

data is passed between processes and as derived data is generated. It encodes
data-governance rules using a formal language and performs reasoning on

its power and utility by working with users performing cyclone tracking and

this approach will lead to more agile, more productive and more trustworthy

complex, particularly when the rules from insect flight dynamics (fast flapping
dynamics and light wings) are not applicable. In these situations, widely used
averaging techniques can fail quickly. The primary motivation is to find
efficient models for complex forms of aerial locomotion where wings constitute
a large part of body mass (i.e., dominant inertial effects) and deform in
multiple directions (i.e., morphing wing).
  In these systems, high degrees of freedom yields complex inertial, Coriolis,
and gravity terms. We use Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) and Bayesian filters
computed with cubature rules conjointly to quickly estimate complex
fluid-structure interactions. In general, Bayesian filters involve finding
complex numerical integration (e.g., find posterior integrals). Using cubature
rules to compute Gaussian-weighted integrals and AD, we show that the complex
multi-degrees-of-freedom dynamics of morphing MAVs can be computed very
efficiently and accurately. Therefore, our work facilitates closed-loop
feedback control of these morphing MAVs.

the bandwidth bottleneck and satisfy the ever-increasing capacity demand in the
future. Due to the high directivity and propagation loss of THz waves, a
massive MIMO system using beamforming is envisioned as a promising technology
in THz communication to realize high-gain and directional transmission.
However, pilots, which are the fundamentals for many beamforming schemes, are
challenging to be accurately detected in the THz band owing to the severe
propagation loss. In this paper, a unified 3D beam training and tracking
procedure is proposed to effectively realize the beamforming in THz
communications, by considering the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation. In
particular, a novel quadruple-uniform planar array (QUPA) architecture is
analyzed to enlarge the signal coverage, increase the beam gain, and reduce the
beam squint loss. Then, a new 3D grid-based (GB) beam training is developed
with low complexity, including the design of the 3D codebook and training
protocol. Finally, a simple yet effective grid-based hybrid (GBH) beam tracking
is investigated to support THz beamforming in an efficient manner. The
communication framework based on this procedure can dynamically trigger beam
training/tracking depending on the real-time quality of service. Numerical
results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed beam
training and tracking over the benchmark methods.

asymmetric with respect to the current and magnetic field directions, and shows
a pronounced magnetic hysteresis. Interestingly, our theoretical calculations
of the JJ with a valley polarized {\nu}=-2 with orbital magnetization as the
weak link explain most of these unconventional features without fine tuning the
parameters. While these unconventional Josephson effects persist up to the
critical temperature Tc ~ 3.5K of the superconducting state, at temperatures
below T < 800mK, we observed a pronounced magnetic hysteresis possibly due to
further spin-polarization of the {\nu}=-2 state. We demonstrate how the
combination of magnetization and its current induced magnetization switching in
the MATBG JJ allows us to realize a programmable zero field superconducting

of prior distributions for the model parameters, we used 50% of the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews to specify rival prior distributions for
$\delta$ and $\tau$. The relative predictive performance of the competing
models and rival prior distributions was assessed using the remaining 50\% of
the Cochrane Database. On average, $\mathcal{H}_1^r$ -- the model that assumes
the presence of a treatment effect as well as across-study heterogeneity --
outpredicted the other models, but not by a large margin. Within
$\mathcal{H}_1^r$, predictive adequacy was relatively constant across the rival
prior distributions. We propose specific empirical prior distributions, both
for the field in general and for each of 46 specific medical subdisciplines. An
example from oral health demonstrates how the proposed prior distributions can
be used to conduct a Bayesian model-averaged meta-analysis in the open-source

factors: the argument itself, the source of the argument, and the properties of
the audience. Understanding the role of each and the interplay between them is
crucial for obtaining insights regarding argument interpretation and
generation. It is particularly important for building effective argument
generation systems that can take both the discourse and the audience
characteristics into account. Having such personalized argument generation
systems would be helpful to expose individuals to different viewpoints and help
them make a more fair and informed decision on an issue. Even though studies in
Social Sciences and Psychology have shown that source and audience effects are
essential components of the persuasion process, most research in computational
persuasion has focused solely on understanding the characteristics of
persuasive language. In this thesis, we make several contributions to
understand the relative effect of the source, audience, and language in
computational persuasion. We first introduce a large-scale dataset with
extensive user information to study these factors' effects simultaneously.
Then, we propose models to understand the role of the audience's prior beliefs
on their perception of arguments. We also investigate the role of social
interactions and engagement in understanding users' success in online debating
over time. We find that the users' prior beliefs and social interactions play
an essential role in predicting their success in persuasion. Finally, we
explore the importance of incorporating contextual information to predict
argument impact and show improvements compared to encoding only the text of the
arguments.

now. The primary goal of the cross-layer approach was to liberate the strict
boundary between the layers of the traditional OSI protocol stack. This is to
enable information flow between layers which then can be leveraged to optimize
the network's performance across the layers. This concept has been of keen
interest for tactical application as there is an overwhelming requirement to
operate in a challenging and dynamic environment. The advent of software
defined radios (SDR) accelerated the growth of this domain due to the added
flexibility provided by SDRs. Even with the immense interest and progress in
this area of research, there has been a gaping abyss between solutions designed
in theory and ones deployed in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time in literature, an embedded SDR has been leveraged to
successfully design a cross-layer optimized transceiver that provides high
throughput and high reliability in a ruggedized, weatherized, and fieldable
form-factor. The design ethos focuses on efficiency and flexibility such that
optimization objectives, cross-layer interactions can be reconfigured rapidly.
To demonstrate our claims, we provide results from extensive outdoor
over-the-air evaluation in various settings with up to 10-node network
typologies. The results demonstrate high reliability, throughput, and dynamic

affects the critical structure of the theory, favoring the symmetric phase

Pseudo-Chern-Simons (PCS) parameter $\theta$ into the dynamical mass generation
of Pseudo quantum electrodynamics (PQED). The $\theta$-parameter provides a
mass scale for PQED at classical level and appears as the pole of the
gauge-field propagator. After calculating the full electron propagator with the
Schwinger-Dyson equation at quenched-rainbow and large-$N$ approximations, we
conclude that $\theta$ affects the critical parameters related to the
fine-structure constant, $\alpha_c(\theta)$, and to the number of copies of the
matter field, $N_c(\theta)$, by favoring the symmetric phase. In the continuum
limit ($\Lambda\to \infty$), nevertheless, the $\theta$-parameter do not affect
the critical parameters. We also compare our analytical results with numerical

is used as a creative element in experiments dealing with alternative forms of

in contemporary dance, experimental dance. This has developed in the course of
the 1970s. Its guiding idea is to shift the focus away from finished
choreography and performance to the processuality, spontaneity, and experience
of dance practice itself. Dance is seen as a laboratory in which to experiment
with gravity, body boundaries, group dynamics and perception. The focus is on
testing, touching, trying. The corresponding events are called either 'Dance
Labs' or 'Movement Research Workshops', depending on the regularity. An
instrument that is often used in the context of such events to create specific
social situations and group dynamics or to channel perceptions in certain
directions is anonymity. Anonymity is broadly understood as the capping of
connections that results in a degree of unaccountability with respect to
various aspects of a person, situation, or activity. For example,
unaccountability can arise from the fact that people can no longer see each
other, so that visual identification becomes impossible, even if only
temporarily. By breaking familiar modes of identification, other forms of
relating can sometimes be emphasized. This is what makes this form of anonymity
so interesting for experimental dance.

features a nontrivial electronic band topology exhibiting Dirac points,
practically gapless Dirac nodal lines, and topological nontrivial edge states.
Consequently, it is a potential candidate for realization of topological
superconductivity in 2D. This system is obtained after replacing the chemically

  We propose to find faults in such systems through adversarial agent

at high speed in an adversarial environment. We evaluate several autonomous

penetration, coughing and gastric peristalsis. However, our knowledge of the
effects of stress on mucus is still rudimentary and mostly limited to
macroscopic rheological measurements, with no insight into the relevant
microscopic mechanisms. Here, we run mechanical tests simultaneously to
measurements of the microscopic dynamics of pig gastric mucus. Strikingly, we
find that a modest shear stress, within the macroscopic rheological linear
regime, dramatically enhances mucus reorganization at the microscopic level, as
signalled by a transient acceleration of the microscopic dynamics, by up to two
orders of magnitude. We rationalize these findings by proposing a simple yet
general model for the dynamics of physical gels under strain and validate its
assumptions through numerical simulations of spring networks. These results
shed new light on the rearrangement dynamics of mucus at the microscopic scale,
with potential implications in phenomena ranging from mucus clearance to
bacterial and drug penetration.

Rust very efficient, but makes Rust relatively hard to learn and use. We
designed Bronze, an optional, library-based garbage collector for Rust. To see
whether Bronze could make Rust more usable, we conducted a randomized

though Bronze users re-did the task without Bronze afterward. Surveys indicated
that ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes were primary causes of the challenges

velocities from the APOGEE pipeline, projected rotation speeds \vsini\
determined from our own pipeline, and distances, masses, and ages measured by
Sanders \& Das. We use the statistical distribution of the maximum shift in the
radial velocities, \drvm, as a proxy for the close binary fraction to explore
the interplay between stellar evolution, rotation, and multiplicity. Assuming
that the minimum orbital period allowed is the critical period for Roche Lobe
overflow and rotational synchronization, we calculate theoretical upper limits
on expected \vsini\ and \drvm\ values. These expectations agree with the
positive correlation between the maximum \drvm\ and \vsini\ values observed in
our sample as a function of \logg. We find that the fast rotators in our sample
have a high occurrence of short-period ($\log(P/\text{d})\lesssim 4$)
companions. We also find that old, rapidly-rotating main sequence stars have
larger completeness-corrected close binary fractions than their younger peers.
Furthermore, rapidly-rotating stars with large \drvm\ consistently show
differences of 1-10 Gyr between the predicted gyrochronological and measured
isochronal ages. These results point towards a link between rapid rotation and
close binarity through tidal interactions. We conclude that stellar rotation is
strongly correlated with stellar multiplicity in the field, and caution should
be taken in the application of gyrochronology relations to cool stars.

overheads on CPU. In this work, we propose a framework for generating scalable
reinforcement learning implementations on multi-core systems. Replay Buffer is
a key component of RL algorithms which facilitates storage of samples obtained
from environmental interactions and data sampling for the learning process. We
define a new data structure for Prioritized Replay Buffer based on $K$-ary sum
tree that supports asynchronous parallel insertions, sampling, and priority
updates. To address the challenge of irregular memory accesses, we propose a
novel data layout to store the nodes of the sum tree that reduces the number of
cache misses. Additionally, we propose $\textit{lazy writing}$ mechanism to
reduce thread-level synchronization overheads of the Replay Buffer operations.
Our framework employs parallel actors to concurrently collect data via
environmental interactions, and parallel learners to perform stochastic
gradient descent using the collected data. Our framework supports a wide range
of reinforcement learning algorithms including DQN, DDPG, etc. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework in accelerating RL algorithms by performing

particles in an effective manner. In this work, we investigate squeezed
coherent states within the hydrodynamic interpretation. The Hamiltonian
operator in question is time dependent, n-dimensional and in quadratic order.
We start by deriving a phase space Wigner probability distribution and an
associated equilibrium entropy for the squeezed coherent states. Then, we
decompose the joint phase space distribution into two portions: a marginal
position distribution and a momentum distribution that is conditioned on the
post-selection of positions. Our conditionally averaged momenta are shown to be
equal to the Bohm's momenta whose connection to the weak measurements is
already known. We also keep track of the corresponding classical system
evolution by identifying shear, magnification and rotation components of the
symplectic phase space dynamics. This allows us to pinpoint which portion of
the underlying classical motion appears in which quantum statistical concept.
We show that our probability distributions satisfy the Fokker-Planck equations
exactly. They can be used to decompose the equilibrium entropy into the missing
information in positions and in momenta as in the Sackur-Tetrode entropy of the
classical kinetic theory. Eventually, we define a quantum pressure, a quantum
temperature and a quantum internal energy which are related to each other in
the same fashion as in the classical kinetic theory. We show that the quantum
potential incorporates the kinetic part of the internal energy and the
fluctuations around it. This allows us to suggest a quantum conditional virial
relation. In the end, we show that the kinetic internal energy is linked to the
fractional Fourier transformer part of the underlying classical dynamics
similar to the case where the energy of a quantum oscillator is linked to its
Maslov index.

existing AI processors either use homogeneous processing elements (PEs),

heterogeneous PEs in sequential, introducing resource redundancy. This paper
proposes a heterogeneous dual-core architecture (dual-OPU), where one core is
optimized for regular convolution layers and the other for depthwise
convolution layers. PEs are homogeneous with each core. To make full use of
dual-core parallelism, we develop a scheduling algorithm to concurrently
execute layers for different input images on dual-core and balance parallel

the input size for each PE to maximize throughput. Compared with a single-core
processor with the same area for a single network, heterogeneous dual-OPU on

universe began at a very low gravitational entropy state, corresponding to zero
Weyl curvature, namely, the FLRW universe. This is a simple assumption with
far-reaching implications. In classical general relativity the most general
cosmological solutions of the Einstein equation are that of the BKL-Misner
inhomogeneous mixmaster types. How could WCH and BKL-M co-exist? An answer was
provided in the 80s with the consideration of quantum field processes such as
vacuum particle creation, which was copious at the Planck time ($10^{-43}
sec$), and their backreaction effects were shown to be so powerful as to
rapidly damp away the irregularities in the geometry. It was proposed that the
vacuum viscosity due to particle creation can act as an efficient transducer of
gravitational entropy (large for BKL-M) to matter entropy, keeping the universe
at that very early time in a state commensurate with the WCH. In this essay I
expand the scope of that inquiry to a broader range, asking how the WCH would
fare with various cosmological theories, from classical to semiclassical to
quantum, focusing on their predictions near the cosmological singularities
(past and future) or avoidance thereof, allowing the Universe to encounter
different scenarios, such as undergoing a phase transition or a bounce. We
point out that regardless of what other processes may be present near the
beginning and the end states of the universe, the backreaction effects of
quantum field processes probably serve as the best guarantor of WCH because
these vacuum processes are ubiquitous, powerful and efficient in dissipating
the irregularities to effectively nudge the Universe to a near-zero Weyl
curvature condition.

Waals (vdW) force due to a perfectly conducting corrugated surface, a neutral
anisotropic polarizable particle in vacuum can be attracted not only to the
nearest corrugation peak, but also to a valley, or an intermediate point
between a peak and a valley, with such behaviors called peak, valley and
intermediate regimes, respectively. In the present paper, we investigate how
these regimes are affected by the consideration of two non-dispersive
semi-infinite dielectrics $\epsilon_{1}$ and $\epsilon_{2}$, separated by a
corrugated interface. Specifically, we study the vdW interaction between a
neutral anisotropic polarizable particle, embedded in the dielectric
$\epsilon_{2}$, and the dielectric $\epsilon_{1}$. We show that when
$\epsilon_{2}<\epsilon_{1}$ the peak, valley and intermediate regimes have,
unless numerical factors, behaviors similar to those found for the situation
where the particle is in vacuum and interacting with a conducting medium. For
the case $\epsilon_{2}>\epsilon_{1}$, one might expect a mere permute between
the peak and valley regimes, in comparison to the case
$\epsilon_{2}<\epsilon_{1}$. Surprisingly, we find that when
$\epsilon_{2}>\epsilon_{1}$ the regimes exhibit a very different and nontrivial
behavior. Moreover, we show that similar regimes arise in the classical case
involving a neutral polarized particle. The description of how the peak, valley
and intermediate regimes are affected by the presence of dielectrics may be
relevant for a better understanding of the interaction between anisotropic
particles and corrugated surfaces.

discriminate against specific protected social groups (e.g., groups based on
gender, ethnicity, etc). Motivated by those results, software engineering
researchers have proposed many methods for mitigating those discriminatory
effects. While those methods are effective in mitigating bias, few of them can
provide explanations on what is the root cause of bias.
  Objective: We aim at better detection and mitigation of algorithmic
discrimination in machine learning software problems.
  Method: Here we propose xFAIR, a model-based extrapolation method, that is
capable of both mitigating bias and explaining the cause. In our xFAIR
approach, protected attributes are represented by models learned from the other
independent variables (and these models offer extrapolations over the space
between existing examples). We then use the extrapolation models to relabel
protected attributes later seen in testing data or deployment time. Our
approach aims to offset the biased predictions of the classification model via
rebalancing the distribution of protected attributes.
  Results: The experiments of this paper show that, without compromising
(original) model performance, xFAIR can achieve significantly better group and
individual fairness (as measured in different metrics) than benchmark methods.
Moreover, when compared to another instance-based rebalancing method, our
model-based approach shows faster runtime and thus better scalability.
  Conclusion: Algorithmic decision bias can be removed via extrapolation that
smooths away outlier points. As evidence for this, our proposed xFAIR is not
only performance-wise better (measured by fairness and performance metrics)
than two state-of-the-art fairness algorithms.

derive a safe control law with Neural Network Dynamic Models (NNDM) remains
unclear due to the lack of computationally tractable methods to deal with these
black-box functions. In fact, even finding the control that minimizes an

current COVID$-$19 pandemic, the unequal distribution and availability of these
vaccines worldwide and the number of people infected in the world lead to the
continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus 2) variants of concern. It is likely that real-time genomic
surveillance will be continuously needed as an unceasing monitoring tool,
necessary to follow the spillover of the disease spread and the evolution of
the virus. In this context, new genomic variants of SARS-CoV-2 that may emerge
as a response to selective pressure, including variants refractory to current
vaccines, makes genomic surveillance programs tools of utmost importance. Here
propose a statistical model for the estimation of the relative frequencies of
SARS-CoV-2 variants in pooled samples. This model is built by considering a
previously defined selection of genomic polymorphisms that characterize
SARS-CoV-2 variants. The methods described here support both raw sequencing
reads for polymorphisms-based markers calling and predefined markers in the VCF
format. Results obtained by using simulated data show that our method is quite
effective in recovering the correct variant proportions. Further, results
obtained by considering longitudinal data from wastewater samples of two
locations in Switzerland agree well with those describing the epidemiological
evolution of COVID-19 variants in clinical samples of these locations. Our
results show that the described method can be a valuable tool for tracking the
proportions of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

sensors collaborate locally within predefined sensor clusters and fuse their
noisy sensor data to reach a common local estimate of the detected event in

depends on the available communication opportunities of the sensors to the

We refer to this hybrid communication scheme as a \emph{cloud-cluster}

complexity caused by heterogeneous sensors' and clusters' detection quality,
heterogeneity in their communication opportunities, and non-convexity of the

resilience to noise in the case of low sensor communication probability with

possible even for a low communication probability by using our cloud-cluster

Optimization methods are used to produce values of these parameters that
optimize a stability measure. Hybrid event shaping captures previously
developed control methods while also producing new optimally stable

Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are becoming increasingly popular to

  This paper proposes a safe learning approach for voltage control. We prove
that the system is guaranteed to be exponentially stable if each controller
satisfies certain Lipschitz constraints. The set of Lipschitz bound is
optimized to enlarge the search space for neural network controllers. We
explicitly engineer the structure of neural network controllers such that they

physical process that can be described in terms of a Markov jump dynamics. We
show that, without any further constraints, a given time-evolution may be
realized at arbitrarily small entropy production, yet at the expense of
diverging activity. For a fixed activity, we find that the dynamics that
minimizes the entropy production is given in terms of conservative forces. The
value of the minimum entropy production is expressed in terms of the
graph-distance based Wasserstein distance between the initial and final
configuration. This yields a new kind of speed limit relating dissipation, the
average number of transitions and the Wasserstein distance. It also allows us
to formulate the optimal transport problem on a graph in term of a
continuous-time interpolating dynamics, in complete analogy to the continuous

time-dependent pump and for spin flips in the Ising model.

based on a set of n velocity functions for n particles, where these functions
depend on the wavefunction from the n-body time-dependent Schroedinger
equation. It is well know that Bohmian mechanics is not applicable to
stationary states, since the velocity field for stationary states is the zero
function. Recently, an alternative to Bohmian mechanics has been formulated,
based on a conservation of energy equation, where the velocity fields are not
the zero function, but this formalism is only applicable to stationary states
with real valued wavefunctions. In this paper, Bohmian mechanics is merged with
the alternative to Bohmian mechanics. This is accomplished by introducing an
interpretation of the Bohm quantum potential. The final formalism gives dynamic
particles for all states, including stationary states. The final main working
equation contains two kinetic energy terms and a term that contains a factor
that can be interpreted as a pressure. The derivation is a simple n-body
generalization of the recent generalization, or refinement, of the Madelung

propose a lightweight one-path conditional generative adversarial network

from a given input conditioned on various reference images. Therefore our
inference model easily adapts to various user preferences, provided with a few
favorable photos from each user. Our model achieves competitive visual and
quantitative results on par with fully supervised methods on both noisy and
clean datasets, while being 6 to 10 times lighter than state-of-the-art

challenging. This is especially true for a large-scale and dynamic system like
the Internet of Things (IoT). One of the core issues in such a system is the
provision of secure access control. In particular, transfer of access rights
from one entity to another in a secure, flexible and fine-grained manner. In
this paper, we present a multi-organisational delegation framework using
blockchain. Our framework takes advantage of blockchain smart contracts to
define the interactions and resource allocation between the consortium of
organisations. We show the feasibility of our solution in a real-world scenario
using the allocation of transportation credits in a multi-level organisational
setting as a use-case. We provide proof of implementation of the proposed
framework using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. Our results
indicate that the proposed framework is efficient and can be used for city-wide
transport, potentially even scale country-wide with a shared blockchain with
complex access control rules. It also bestows better transparency to the
delegation of access rights and control over the employees' transportation
access for the organisations.

speech information (such as speaker, content, etc.) is the key to achieving
remarkable performance. Some recent attempts about speech representation
decoupling on the neutral speech can not work well on the emotional speech, due
to the more complex acoustic properties involved in the latter. To address this
problem, here we propose a novel Source-Filter-based Emotional VC model (SFEVC)
to achieve proper filtering of speaker-independent emotion features from both
the timbre and pitch features. Our SFEVC model consists of multi-channel
encoders, emotion separate encoders, and one decoder. Note that all encoder
modules adopt a designed information bottlenecks auto-encoder. Additionally, to
further improve the conversion quality for various emotions, a novel two-stage

Experimental results show that the proposed SFEVC along with a two-stage

communicating with their neighbors over a predetermined network topology. We
develop a new algorithm, called DEcentralized STochastic REcurSive gradient

fraction, RTapp estimated the daily and cumulative doses received by targets
and OARs from daily 3D imaging in real-time. RTapp also included a prediction
algorithm that analyzed dosimetric parameters (DP) trends against dosimetric
endpoints (DE) to trigger adaptation up to 4 fractions ahead. Warning (V95<95%)
and adaptation (V95<93%) DEs were set for PTVs. OAR adaptation DEs of +10%
(DE10) were set for all Dmax and Dmean DPs. Any DE violation at end of
treatment (EOT) triggered a DP trends review to determine the DE-crossing
fraction Fx and evaluate the prediction model accuracy (difference between
calculated and predicted DP values with 95% confidence intervals). Results:
RTapp was able to address the needs of treatment adaptation. 15/22 studies
(68%) violated PTV coverage or parotids Dmean at EOT. 9 PTVs had V95<95% (mean
coverage decrease of -7.7+/-3.3 %) including 4 flagged for adaptation at median
Fx=11.5 (range: 6-18). 15 parotids were flagged for exceeding Dmean constraints
with median increase of +3.18 Gy (range: 0.18-6.31 Gy) at EOT, including 8 with
DP>DE10. The differences between predicted and calculated PTV V95 and parotids
Dmean was up to 7.6% (mean: -2.9+/-4.6 %) and 5 Gy (mean: 0.2+/-1.6 Gy),
respectively. The most accurate predictions were obtained closest to Fx. For
parotids, Fx ranged between fractions 1 to 23, the lack of specific trend
demonstrated the need to verify treatment adaptation for every fraction.
Conclusion: Integrated in an ART clinical workflow, RTapp can predict whether
specific treatment would require adaptation up to 4 fractions ahead of time.

disturbance of overlapped components with similar representations. This paper
aims to address the issue with a mask-and-predict strategy. We take the words

distributions on their positions. Our metric, Neighboring Distribution
Divergence (NDD), represent the semantic distance by calculating the divergence
between distributions in the overlapped parts. Experiments on Semantic Textual
Similarity show NDD to be more sensitive to various semantic differences,
especially on highly overlapped paired texts. Based on the discovery, we
further implement an unsupervised and training-free method for text
compression, leading to a significant improvement on the previous
perplexity-based method. The high scalability of our method even enables NDD to
outperform the supervised state-of-the-art in domain adaption by a huge margin.
Further experiments on syntax and semantics analyses verify the awareness of

is a primary task for condensed matter physics. As conjectured many decades
ago, in the low-temperature and high-pressure part of the phase diagram, solid
hydrogen is expected to become metallic with a high superconducting transition
temperature. The metallization may occur via band gap closure in the molecular
solid or via a transition to the atomic solid. Recently, a few experimental
studies pushed the achievable pressures into the 400 - 500 GPa range. There are
strong indications that at some pressure in this range metallization via either
of these mechanisms occurs, although there are disagreements between
experimental reports. Furthermore, there are multiple good candidate crystal
phases that have emerged from recent computational and experimental studies
which may be realized in upcoming experiments. Therefore, it is crucial to
determine the superconducting properties of these candidate phases. In a recent
study, we reported the superconducting properties of the C2/c-24 phase, which
we believe to be a strong candidate for metallization via band gap closure [M.
Dogan et al., arXiv:2107.03889 (2021)]. Here, we report the superconducting
properties of the Cmca-12, Cmca-4 and I41/amd-2 phases including the anharmonic
effects using a Wannier function-based dense k-point and q-point sampling. We
find that the Cmca-12 phase has a superconducting transition temperature that
rises from 86 K at 400 GPa to 212 K at 500 GPa, whereas the Cmca-4 and
I41/amd-2 phases show a less pressure-dependent behavior with their Tc in the
74 - 94 K and 307 - 343 K ranges, respectively. These properties can be used to
distinguish between crystal phases in future experiments. Understanding
superconductivity in pure hydrogen is also important in the study of high-Tc

Since $T_E$ is the positive cone of the graded Grothendieck group $K_0^{gr}(L_K

program composed of geometric operations, each of which depends on a set of
parameters. Program representations enable meaningful and controlled shape
variations via parameter changes. However, achieving desired modifications
solely through parameter editing is challenging when CAD models have not been
explicitly authored to expose select degrees of freedom in advance. We
introduce a novel bidirectional editing system for 3D CAD programs. In addition
to editing the CAD program, users can directly manipulate 3D geometry and our
system infers parameter updates to keep both representations in sync. We
formulate inverse edits as a set of constrained optimization objectives,
returning plausible updates to program parameters that both match user intent
and maintain program validity. Our approach implements an automatically
differentiable domain-specific language for CAD programs, providing derivatives
for this optimization to be performed quickly on any expressed program. Our
system enables rapid, interactive exploration of a constrained 3D design space
by allowing users to manipulate the program and geometry interchangeably during
design iteration. While our approach is not designed to optimize across changes
in geometric topology, we show it is expressive and performant enough for users
to produce a diverse set of design variants, even when the CAD program contains
a large number of parameters.

  Political Communication",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper investigates visual media shared by US national politicians on
Twitter, how a politician's variety of image types shared reflects their
political position, and identifies a hazard in using standard methods for image
characterization in this context. While past work has yielded valuable results
on politicians' use of imagery in social media, that work has focused primarily
on photographic media, which may not be sufficient given the variety of visual
media shared in such spaces (e.g., infographics, illustrations, or memes).
Leveraging three popular deep learning models to characterize politicians'
visuals, this work uses clustering to identify eight types of visual media
shared on Twitter, several of which are not photographic in nature. Results
also show individual politicians share a variety of these types, and the
distributions of their imagery across these clusters is correlated with their
overall ideological position -- e.g., liberal politicians appear to share a
larger proportion of infographic-style images, and conservative politicians
appear to share more patriotic imagery. At the same time, manual assessment
reveals that these image characterization models group images with vastly
different semantic meaning into the same clusters, as confirmed in a post-hoc
analysis of hateful memetic imagery. These results suggest that, while
image-characterization techniques do identify general types of imagery that
correlate with political ideology, these methods miss critical semantic -- and
therefore politically relevant -- differences among images. Consequently, care
should be taken when dealing with the varieties of imagery shared in online
spaces, especially in political contexts.

supernova explosion can be achieved even in 1D geometry. We find that smaller
diffusive transport on the internal energy makes the shock revival faster and
explosion energy larger in contrast to the prediction of the previous study.
The smaller diffusion keeps the negative entropy gradients and enhances the
turbulent pressure, hindering mass accretion in the gain region. The progenitor

construction. One particular challenge of assessing volatility forecasts is how
to construct a robust proxy for the unknown true volatility. In this work, we
show that the empirical loss comparison between two volatility predictors
hinges on the deviation of the volatility proxy from the true volatility. We
then establish non-asymptotic deviation bounds for three robust volatility
proxies, two of which are based on clipped data, and the third of which is
based on exponentially weighted Huber loss minimization. In particular, in
order for the Huber approach to adapt to non-stationary financial returns, we
propose to solve a tuning-free weighted Huber loss minimization problem to
jointly estimate the volatility and the optimal robustification parameter at
each time point. We then inflate this robustification parameter and use it to
update the volatility proxy to achieve optimal balance between the bias and
variance of the global empirical loss. We also extend this Huber method to
construct volatility predictors. Finally, we exploit the proposed robust
volatility proxy to compare different volatility predictors on the Bitcoin
market data. It turns out that when the sample size is limited, applying the
robust volatility proxy gives more consistent and stable evaluation of
volatility forecasts.

issues, we formulate heterogeneous molecular graphs (HMGs), and introduce a
novel architecture to exploit both molecular motifs and 3D geometry. Precisely,
we extract functional groups as motifs for small molecules and employ
reinforcement learning to adaptively select quaternary amino acids as motif
candidates for proteins. Then HMGs are constructed with both atom-level and
motif-level nodes. To better accommodate those HMGs, we introduce a variant of
Transformer named Molformer, which adopts a heterogeneous self-attention layer
to distinguish the interactions between multi-level nodes. Besides, it is also
coupled with a multi-scale mechanism to capture fine-grained local patterns
with increasing contextual scales. An attentive farthest point sampling
algorithm is also proposed to obtain the molecular representations. We validate
Molformer across a broad range of domains, including quantum chemistry,
physiology, and biophysics. Extensive experiments show that Molformer
outperforms or achieves the comparable performance of several state-of-the-art
baselines. Our work provides a promising way to utilize informative motifs from

incorporating the Allee Effect, focussing on the onset of extreme events in the
coupled system. First we show that the interplay between coupling and the Allee
effect may change the nature of the dynamics, with regular periodic dynamics
becoming chaotic in a range of Allee parameters and coupling strengths.
Further, the growth in the vegetation population displays an explosive blow-up
beyond a critical value of coupling strength and Allee parameter. Most
interestingly, we observe that beyond a threshold of coupling strength and
Allee parameter, the population densities of all three species exhibit non-zero
probability of yielding extreme events. The emergence of extreme events in the
predator populations in the patches is the most prevalent, and the probability
of obtaining large deviations in the predator populations is not affected
significantly by either the coupling strength or the Allee effect. In the
absence of the Allee effect the prey population in the coupled system exhibits
no extreme events for low coupling strengths, but yields a sharp increase in
extreme events after a critical strength of coupling. The vegetation population
in the patches display a small finite probability of extreme events for strong
enough coupling, only in the presence of Allee effect. Lastly we consider the
influence of additive noise on the continued prevalence of extreme events. Very
significantly, we find that noise suppresses the unbounded vegetation growth
that was induced by a combination of Allee effect and coupling. Further, we
demonstrate that noise mitigates extreme events in all three populations, and
beyond a noise level we do not observe any extreme events in the system at all.
This finding has important bearing on the potential observability of extreme
events in natural and laboratory systems.

in an optical ring cavity gives rise to many interesting phenomena such as
supersolid and movable self-trapped matter wave packets. Here we examined the
collision of two self-trapped atomic matter wave packets in an optical ring
cavity, and abundant colliding phenomena have been found in the system.
Depending on the magnitude of colliding velocity, the collision dynamics
exhibit very different features compared with the cavity-free case. When the
initial colliding velocities of the two wave packets are small, they
correlatedly oscillate around their initial equilibrium positions with a small
amplitude. Increasing the collision velocity leads to severe scattering of the
BEC atoms; after the collision, the two self-trapped wave packets usually break
into small pieces. Interestingly, we found that such a medium velocity
collision is of great phase sensitivity, which may make the system useful in
precision matter wave interferometry. When the colliding velocity is further
increased, in the bad cavity limit, the two wave packets collide phenomenally
similar to two classical particles -- they firstly approach each other, then
separate with their shape virtually maintained. However, beyond the bad cavity
limit, they experience severe spatial spreading.

solving linear algebraic equations (LAEs). An inherent relationship is revealed
between the problem-solving of LAEs and the design of observer-based control
systems, with which the iterative method for solving LAEs is exploited based on
the design of the basic state observers. It is shown that all (least squares)
solutions for any (un)solvable LAEs can be determined exponentially fast or
monotonically with different selections of initial conditions. By integrating
the design idea of the deadbeat control, the solving of LAEs can be achieved
within only finite iterations. In particular, our proposed iterative method can
be leveraged to develop a new observer-based design algorithm to realize the

using FDSOI. The GC has several desirable characteristics, including ~50%
higher storage density and ~50% lower dynamic energy as compared to the
traditional 6T SRAM, even after accounting for peripheral circuit overheads. We
also exploit back-gate bias to increase retention time to 1.12 ms (~60x of
eDRAM) which, combined with optimizations like staggered refresh, makes it an
ideal candidate to architect all levels of on-chip caches. We show that
compared to 6T SRAM, for a given area budget, GC based caches, on average,
provide 29% and 36% increase in IPC for single- and multi-programmed workloads,
respectively on contemporary workloads including SPEC CPU2017. We also observe
dynamic energy savings of 42% and 34% for single- and multi-programmed

  We utilize the inherent properties of the proposed GC, including decoupled
read and write bitlines to devise optimizations to save precharge energy and
architect GC caches with better energy and performance characteristics.
Finally, in a quest to utilize the best of all worlds, we combine GC with
STT-RAM to create hybrid hierarchies. We show that a hybrid hierarchy with GC
caches at L1 and L2, and an LLC split between GC and STT-RAM, with asymmetric
write optimization enabled, is able to provide a 54% benefit in energy-delay

design problem naturally possesses a bilevel structure, in which a designer

equilibrium. The existing bilevel optimization algorithms raise a dilemma when
applied to this problem: anticipating how incentives affect the agents at
equilibrium requires solving the equilibrium problem repeatedly, which is
computationally inefficient; bypassing the time-consuming step of
equilibrium-finding can reduce the computational cost, but may lead the
designer to a sub-optimal solution. To address such a dilemma, we propose a
method that tackles the designer's and agents' problems simultaneously in a
single loop. Specifically, at each iteration, both the designer and the agents
only move one step. Nevertheless, we allow the designer to gradually learn the
overall influence of the incentives on the agents, which guarantees optimality

generation systems, it would be advantageous to specify local compliance
criteria for these devices to ensure the small-signal stability of the
interconnected system. Passivity of the device admittance, which is an example
of a local criterion, has been used previously to avoid resonances between
these devices and the lightly damped oscillatory modes of the network. Typical
active and reactive power control strategies like droop control and virtual
synchronous generator control inherently violate the passivity constraints on
admittance at low frequencies, although this does not necessarily mean that the
interconnected system will be unstable. Therefore, passivity of the admittance
is unsuitable as a stability criterion for devices that are represented by
their wide-band models. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes the use
of criteria based on admittance at higher frequencies and an alternative
transfer function at lower frequencies. The alternative representation uses
active and reactive power and the derivatives of the polar components of
voltage as interface variables. To allow for the separate analysis at low and
high frequencies, the device dynamics should exhibit a slow-fast separation;
this is proposed as an additional constraint. Adherence to the proposed
criteria is not onerous and is easily verifiable through frequency response
analysis.

Still, two imminent challenges exist for this task. First, the models often

error-prioritized experience replay (PER). We also show that our model performs
well on both de novo and scaffold-based schemes. Our model produces molecules
of higher quality compared to existing methods while achieving state-of-the-art

concerns as GPUs lack a trusted environment to protect the data. Trusted
execution environments (TEEs) have emerged as a promising solution to achieve
privacy-preserving learning. Unfortunately, TEEs' limited computing power
renders them not comparable to GPUs in performance. To improve the trade-off
among privacy, computing performance, and model accuracy, we propose an
\emph{asymmetric} model decomposition framework, \AsymML{}, to (1) accelerate
training using parallel hardware; and (2) achieve a strong privacy guarantee
using TEEs and differential privacy (DP) with much less accuracy compromised
compared to DP-only methods. By exploiting the low-rank characteristics in
training data and intermediate features, \AsymML{} asymmetrically decomposes
inputs and intermediate activations into low-rank and residual parts. With the
decomposed data, the target DNN model is accordingly split into a
\emph{trusted} and an \emph{untrusted} part. The trusted part performs
computations on low-rank data, with low compute and memory costs. The untrusted
part is fed with residuals perturbed by very small noise. Privacy, computing
performance, and model accuracy are well managed by respectively delegating the
trusted and the untrusted part to TEEs and GPUs. We provide a formal DP
guarantee that demonstrates that, for the same privacy guarantee, combining
asymmetric data decomposition and DP requires much smaller noise compared to
solely using DP without decomposition. This improves the privacy-utility
trade-off significantly compared to using only DP methods without
decomposition. Furthermore, we present a rank bound analysis showing that the
low-rank structure is preserved after each layer across the entire model.

matrix having the so-called butterfly structure admits an essentially unique
factorization into $J$ butterfly factors (where $N = 2^{J}$), and that the

in recursively factorizing the considered matrix into two factors. This

Furthermore, these conclusions suggest that the thermal LQU captures a stronger

maximal for small magnetic field values at low temperatures. Finally, we note
that the state's systems become non-entangled and separable when the gap

are: (i) networks trained on noisy data have lower consistency than those
trained on clean data, and(ii) the consistency reduces more significantly
around noisy-labelled training data points than correctly-labelled ones. Then,
we show that a simple loss function that encourages consistency improves the
robustness of the models to label noise on both synthetic (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100)

distribution (SED) of X-ray illuminated accretion discs, that takes into
account the mutual interaction of the accretion disc and the X-ray corona,
including all relativistic effects. We assume a Keplerian, optically thick and
geometrically thin accretion disc and an X-ray source in the lamp-post geometry
that emits an isotropic power-law spectrum with a high-energy cut-off. We
assume that all the energy that would be released by thermal radiation in the
standard disc model in its innermost part, is transported to the corona,
effectively cooling the disc in this region. We include the disc heating due to
thermalisation of the absorbed part of the disc illumination by X-ray corona.
The X-ray reflection from the disc is also included. We compute the X-ray
luminosity and the low-energy X-ray cut-off through an iterative process,
taking full account of the interplay between the X-ray illumination of the disc
and the resulting accretion disc spectrum which enters the corona so that the
energy balance is preserved. The corona radius is also computed from the
conservation of the photon's number during Comptonization.
  We discuss the model SEDs and their dependence on system parameters. The
disc-corona interaction has profound effects - it constrains the X-ray
luminosity and changes the shape and normalisation of the UV/optical blue bump.
We use the new code to fit the broad-band SED of a typical Seyfert 1 galaxy,
NGC 5548. We infer a high black-hole spin, an intermediate system inclination,
and an accretion rate below 10% of Eddington. The X-ray luminosity in this
source could be supported by 45-70% of the accretion energy dissipated in the
disc. The new model, named KYNSED, is publicly available to be used for fitting
AGN SEDs inside the XSPEC spectral analysis tool.

role in the thermodynamics and chemistry of circumstellar discs, driving their

atmospheres of newborn planets. In this paper we study the influence of stellar
mass on circumstellar disc mass-loss rates due to X-ray irradiation, extending
our previous study of the mass-loss rate's dependence on the X-ray luminosity
and spectrum hardness. We focus on stars with masses between 0.1 and 1 Solar
mass, which are the main target of current and future missions to find
potentially habitable planets. We find a linear relationship between the
mass-loss rates and the stellar masses when changing the X-ray luminosity
accordingly with the stellar mass. This linear increase is observed also when
the X-ray luminosity is kept fixed because of the lower disc aspect ratio which
allows the X-ray irradiation to reach larger radii. We provide new analytical
relations for the mass-loss rates and profiles of photoevaporative winds as a
function of the stellar mass that can be used in disc and planet population
synthesis models. Our photoevaporative models correctly predict the observed
trend of inner-disc lifetime as a function of stellar mass with an increased
steepness for stars smaller than 0.3 Solar mass, indicating that X-ray
photoevaporation is a good candidate to explain the observed disc dispersal

introducing multiple complementary discriminators that provide diverse

their parameters. The second way is Data-Discrepancy Co-training (DaCo) which
achieves co-training by feeding discriminators with different views of the

Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks show that GenCo achieves
superior generation with limited training data. In addition, GenCo also
complements the augmentation approach with consistent and clear performance

relativistic critical density front. While simulations promise extremely high
ion energies in in this regime, the challenge resides in the realization of a
synchronized movement of the ultra-relativistic laser pulse ($a_0\gtrsim 30$)
driven reflective relativistic electron front and the fastest ions, which
imposes a narrow parameter range on the laser and plasma parameters. We present
an analytic model for the relevant processes, confirmed by a broad parameter
simulation study in 1D- and 3D-geometry. By tayloring the pulse length plasma
density profile at the front side, we can optimize the proton acceleration
performance and extend the regions in parameter space of efficient ion
acceleration at the relativistic relativistic density surface.

possible spectra of such functions include three sets consisting of precisely:
the computable degree, all c.e. degrees and all $\Delta_2$ degrees. These
results, however, fall far short of the full classification. In this paper, we

complexity equal to the c.e. degrees. We also answer the questions raised by
Wright and Harrison-Trainor by showing that the division between computable,

on the terrestrial environment; the second is characterized by no-flares or
having just few C- and B-class flares. We found that the two tested methods

sets of infinite words over some alphabet of colors. A well-studied class of
objectives is the one of $\omega$-regular objectives, due to its relation to
many natural problems in theoretical computer science. We focus on the strategy
complexity question: given an objective, how much memory does each player
require to play as well as possible? A classical result is that finite-memory
strategies suffice for both players when the objective is $\omega$-regular. We
show a reciprocal of that statement: when both players can play optimally with
a chromatic finite-memory structure (i.e., whose updates can only observe
colors) in all infinite game graphs, then the objective must be
$\omega$-regular. This provides a game-theoretic characterization of
$\omega$-regular objectives, and this characterization can help in obtaining
memory bounds. Moreover, a by-product of our characterization is a new
one-to-two-player lift: to show that chromatic finite-memory structures suffice
to play optimally in two-player games on infinite graphs, it suffices to show
it in the simpler case of one-player games on infinite graphs. We illustrate

dataset is a challenge in various fields including data mining, neuroscience
and chemometrics. For example, measurements may evolve over time or have
unaligned time profiles. The PARAFAC2 model has been successfully used to
analyze such data by allowing the underlying factor matrices in one mode (i.e.,
the evolving mode) to change across slices. The traditional approach to fit a
PARAFAC2 model is to use an alternating least squares-based algorithm, which
handles the constant cross-product constraint of the PARAFAC2 model by
implicitly estimating the evolving factor matrices. This approach makes
imposing regularization on these factor matrices challenging. There is
currently no algorithm to flexibly impose such regularization with general
penalty functions and hard constraints. In order to address this challenge and
to avoid the implicit estimation, in this paper, we propose an algorithm for
fitting PARAFAC2 based on alternating optimization with the alternating
direction method of multipliers (AO-ADMM). With numerical experiments on
simulated data, we show that the proposed PARAFAC2 AO-ADMM approach allows for
flexible constraints, recovers the underlying patterns accurately, and is
computationally efficient compared to the state-of-the-art. We also apply our
model to two real-world datasets from neuroscience and chemometrics, and show
that constraining the evolving mode improves the interpretability of the
extracted patterns.

all input automata accept a language in some level of the dot-depth hierarchy,
or some level of the Straubing-Th\'{e}rien hierarchy. Automata accepting
languages from the lowest levels of these hierarchies arise naturally in the
context of model checking. We identify a dichotomy in the dot-depth hierarchy
by showing that the problem is already NP-complete when all input automata
accept languages of the levels zero or one half and already PSPACE-hard when
all automata accept a language from the level one. Conversely, we identify a
tetrachotomy in the Straubing-Th\'{e}rien hierarchy. More precisely, we show
that the problem is in AC$^0$ when restricted to level zero; complete for
LOGSPACE or NLOGSPACE, depending on the input representation, when restricted
to languages in the level one half; NP-complete when the input is given as DFAs
accepting a language in from level one or three half; and finally,
PSPACE-complete when the input automata accept languages in level two or

studied extensively. However, index-based approaches for this are almost
exclusively designed for graphs with categorical vertex and edge labels and

application of the Lifshitz theory with reflection coefficients written via the

nonlocal response functions introduced for the case of nonmagnetic media. It is
shown that at separations from 100 to 800~nm the Casimir pressures computed
using the alternative nonlocal and local plasma response functions differ by
less than 1\%. At separations of a few micrometers, the predictions of these
two approaches differ between themselves and between that one obtained using
the Drude function by several tens of percent. We also compute the gradient of
the Casimir force between Ni-coated surfaces of a sphere and a plate using the

be addressed by a graph pruning algorithm. It carefully removes vertices and
edges to keep the graph size reasonable while preserving the information needed
to provide good SLAM results. We propose a novel method that considers
geometric criteria for choosing the vertices to be pruned. It is efficient,
easy to implement, and leads to a graph with evenly spread vertices that remain

marginalization that is more robust to wrong loop closures than existing

coronal rain on the stability of prominence and subsequent eruption of CMEs. We
used the simultaneous observations from AIA/SDO and SECCHI/STEREO spacecrafts
from different angles to follow the dynamics of prominence/filaments and to
study the role of coronal rain in their destabilisation. Three different
prominences/filaments observed during years 2011-2012 were analysed using
observations acquired by SDO and STEREO. In all three cases massive coronal
rain from the prominence body led to the destabilisation of prominence and
subsequently to the eruption of CMEs. The upward rising of prominences
consisted in the slow and the fast rise phases. The coronal rain triggered the
initial slow rise of prominences, which led to the final instability (the fast
rise phase) after 18-28 hours in all cases. The estimated mass flux carried by
coronal rain blobs showed that the prominences became unstable after 40 \% of
mass loss. We suggest that the initial slow rise phase was triggered by the
mass loss of prominence due to massive coronal rain, while the fast rise phase,
i.e. the consequent instability of prominences, was caused by the torus
instability and/or magnetic reconnection with overlying coronal field.
Therefore, the coronal rain triggered the instability of prominences and
consequent CMEs. If this is the case, then the coronal rain can be used to
predict the CMEs and hence to improve the space weather predictions.

Exploratory Setup (RADES) at CERN in particular is searching for axion dark

depends linearly on the quality factor of the cavity and therefore we are
researching the possibility of coating our cavities with different
superconducting materials to increase the quality factor. Since the experiment
operates in strong magnetic fields of 11 T and more, superconductors with high
critical magnetic fields are necessary. Suitable materials for this application
are for example REBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, Nb$_3$Sn or NbN. We designed a
microwave cavity which resonates at around 9~GHz, with a geometry optimized to
facilitate superconducting coating and designed to fit in the bore of available
high-field accelerator magnets at CERN. Several prototypes of this cavity were
coated with different superconducting materials, employing different coating
techniques. These prototypes were characterized in strong magnetic fields at

dimension covers the modeling of the liability liquidity risk (or funding
liquidity), the second dimension is dedicated to the modeling of the asset
liquidity risk (or market liquidity), whereas the third dimension considers the
management of the asset-liability liquidity risk (or asset-liability matching).
The purpose of this research is to propose a methodological and practical
framework in order to perform liquidity stress testing programs, which comply
with regulatory guidelines (ESMA, 2019, 2020) and are useful for fund managers.
In this third and last research paper focused on managing the asset-liability
liquidity risk, we explore the ALM tools that can be put in place to control
the liquidity gap. These ALM tools can be split into three categories:
measurement tools, management tools and monitoring tools. In terms of
measurement tools, we focus on the computation of the redemption coverage ratio
(RCR), which is the central instrument of liquidity stress testing programs. We
also study the redemption liquidation policy and the different implementation
methodologies, and we show how reverse stress testing can be developed. In
terms of liquidity management tools, we study the calibration of liquidity
buffers, the pros and cons of special arrangements (redemption suspensions,
gates, side pockets and in-kind redemptions) and the effectiveness of swing
pricing. In terms of liquidity monitoring tools, we compare the macro- and
micro-approaches of liquidity monitoring in order to identify the transmission
channels of liquidity risk.

more areas of application, little has been applied to make deep Reinforcement
Learning (RL) more comprehensible. As RL becomes ubiquitous and used in
critical and general public applications, it is essential to develop methods
that make it better understood and more interpretable. This study proposes a
novel approach to explain cooperative strategies in multiagent RL using Shapley
values, a game theory concept used in XAI that successfully explains the
rationale behind decisions taken by Machine Learning algorithms. Through
testing common assumptions of this technique in two cooperation-centered
socially challenging multi-agent environments environments, this article argues
that Shapley values are a pertinent way to evaluate the contribution of players
in a cooperative multi-agent RL context. To palliate the high overhead of this
method, Shapley values are approximated using Monte Carlo sampling.
Experimental results on Multiagent Particle and Sequential Social Dilemmas show
that Shapley values succeed at estimating the contribution of each agent. These
results could have implications that go beyond games in economics, (e.g., for
non-discriminatory decision making, ethical and responsible AI-derived
decisions or policy making under fairness constraints). They also expose how
Shapley values only give general explanations about a model and cannot explain
a single run, episode nor justify precise actions taken by agents. Future work
should focus on addressing these critical aspects.

impact of critical nematic fluctuations on the low energy properties of
phonons. In this study we propose how to identify the three-state Potts nematic
fluctuations by ultrasound attenuation. The Gaussian fluctuation analysis shows
that the Landau damping term becomes isotropic due to fluctuations of the
$C_{3}$-breaking bond-order, and the nemato-elastic coupling is also shown to
be isotropic. These two features lead to an isotropic divergence of the
transverse sound attenuation coefficient and an isotropic lattice softening, in
contrast to the case of the $C_4$-breaking bond-order which shows the strong
anisotropy. Moreover, we use a mean-field approximation and discuss the
impurity effects. The transition temperature takes its maximum near the filling
of the van-Hove singularity, and the large density of states favors the nematic
phase transition. It turns out that the phase transition is of weak first-order
in the wide range of filling and, with increasing the impurity scattering, the
first order transition line at low temperatures gradually shifts towards the
second-order line, rendering the transition a weak first-order in a wider range
of parameters. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the enhancement of the
ultrasound attenuation coefficient will be clearly observed in experiments in
the case of a weak first-order phase transition.

instability. It is suggested that the coronal rain is the result of an unstable
process, and the coronal plasma returns its stable state after the rain.

asset-pricing framework of Brody-Hughston-Macrina to a more general set-up. We
include a wider class of models for market information and in contrast to the
original paper, we consider a model in which a credit risky asset is modelled
in the presence of a default time. Instead of using only a Brownian bridge as a
noise, we consider another important type of noise. We model the flow of
information about a default bond with given random repayments at a
predetermined maturity date by the so called market information process, this
process is the sum of two terms, namely the cash flow induced by the repayment
at maturity and a noise, a stochastic process set up by adding a Brownian
bridge with length equal to the maturity date and a drift, linear in time,
multiplied by a time changed L\'evy process. In this model the information
concerning the random cash-flow is modelled explicitly but the default time of
the company is not since the payment is contractually set to take place at
maturity only. We suggest a model, in which the cash flow and the time of
bankruptcy are both modelled, which covers contracts, e.g. defaultable bonds,
to be paid at hit. From a theoretical point of view, this paper deals with
conditions, which allow to keep the Markov property, when we replace the
pinning point in the Brownian bridge by a process. For this purpose, we first
study the basic mathematical properties of a bridge between two Brownian

for circular polarization and $2$-fold rotational operator (or reflection
operator) for linear polarization. As a variant of graphene quantum dot (GQD),
twisted bilayer graphene quantum dot (TBGQD) certainly inherits GQD's
advantages including ultrathin thickness, excellent biocompatibility and shape-
and size-tunable optical absorption/emission. We then naturally ask how the
electronic structures and optical properties of TBGQDs rely on size, shape,
twist angle and correlation effects. We build plentiful types of TBGQDs with
$10$ point groups and obtain the optical selection rule database for all types,
where the current operator matrix elements identify the generalized

electronic and optical band gaps follow power-law scalings and the twist angle
has the dominant role in modifying the size scaling. We map an atlas of optical
conductivity spectra for both size and twist angle in TBGQDs. As a result of
quantum confinement effect of finite size, in the atlas a new type of optical
conductivity peaks absent in twisted bilayer graphene bulk is predicted
theoretically with multiple discrete absorption frequencies from infrared to
ultraviolet light, enabling applications on photovoltaic devices and
photodetectors. The atlas and size scaling provide a full

theory as the ultimate fundamental description of nature. Quantum theory may
not be complete if founded upon classical notions. Louis de Broglie, seeming to
be more or less convinced about the ontology of his proposed matter waves,
tried to develop a theory of sub-quantum degrees of freedom relying on
statistical thermodynamics. He realized a quantum particle as a fluctuating
dense corpuscle formed via non-linear effects from a sub-quantum medium. A wave
on the medium guides the vibrating corpuscle. He argued that an intrinsic clock
of a quantum particle is related to its Brownian motion at the sub-quantum
level. This led him to conjecture a relation between the de Broglie clock
frequency $m c^2/h$ and its implicit temperature, which equals that of the
surrounding sub-quantum medium. About the same time, Mandelbrot was the first
to derive in a classical setting a thermodynamic uncertainty relation between
energy and temperature, that was, coincidentally or not, anticipated by Bohr
and Heisenberg in the first years of development of quantum theory. We show
here that, when the de Broglie temperature-time conjecture is assumed, the
thermodynamic temperature-energy uncertainty relation leads to the quantum
time-energy uncertainty relation.

use to reconstruct white matter fibers in the brain. The present study is not
focusing on data acquisition where scanning is performed. The Adaptive Gradient
Directions (AGD) approach is extended to refine the position and area of the
grid, resulting in an admissible reduction in angular error. We begin with the
gradient directions distributed uniformly inside a grid of bigger size and with
larger spacing between the points. Both (size of the grid and spacing between
the points) reduce iteratively. The proposed algorithm ensures that the actual
position of fiber comes inside the grid at each iteration, unlike as in the AGD
approach. As a result, the solution tends to actual orientation in each
iteration followed by better estimation of fibers. The proposed algorithm is
validated by associating it with mixture of Gaussian diffusion and mixture of
non-central Wishart distribution models. The proposed approach significantly
reduce the angular error for multiple computer-generated experiments on
synthetic simulations and real data. Moreover, we have also performed
simulations with fibers not residing in the XY-plane. For this set-up also, the
proposed work outperforms, giving lesser angular error with both the models.
Synthetic simulations have been performed with Rician distributed (R-D) noise
of standard deviation ranging from 0.02-0.1. This work helps in better
understanding of the anatomy of the brain using the MRI signal data.

manifesting in penumbral filaments in the penumbra and in umbral dots in the

  Aims. Here we compare the physical properties of umbral dots and penumbral
filaments. Our goal is to understand how the properties of these convective
features change across the boundary between the umbra and the penumbra and how
this is related to the rapid increase in brightness at the umbra-penumbra
boundary.
  Methods. We derived ensemble averages of the physical properties of different
types of convective features based on observations of two sunspots with Hinode.
  Results. There are strong similarities between the convective features in the
outer parts of the umbra and the ones in the penumbra, with most physical
parameters being smooth and continuous functions of the length of the features.
  Conclusions. Our results indicate that the transition in brightness from the
umbra to the penumbra is solely caused by an increased effectiveness of
magnetoconvection within individual convective cells. There is no significant
difference in the number density of convective elements between the outer umbra
and the inner penumbra. Penumbral filaments exhibit a larger area and a higher
brightness compared to umbral dots. It is still unclear, how exactly the
underlying magnetic field causes the increase in size and brightness of
convective features in the penumbra.

  Powell","Willis coupling-induced acoustic radiation force and torque reversal",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Acoustic meta-atoms serve as the building blocks of metamaterials, with
linear properties designed to achieve functions such as beam steering, cloaking
and focusing. They have also been used to shape the characteristics of incident
acoustic fields, which led to the manipulation of acoustic radiation force and
torque for development of acoustic tweezers with improved spatial resolution.
However, acoustic radiation force and torque also depend on the shape of the
object, which strongly affects its scattering properties. We show that by
designing linear properties of an object using metamaterial concepts, the
nonlinear acoustic effects of radiation force and torque can be controlled.
Trapped objects are typically small compared to the wavelength, and are
described as particles, inducing monopole and dipole scattering. We extend such
models to a polarizability tensor including Willis coupling terms, as a measure
of asymmetry, capturing the significance of geometrical features. We apply our
model to a three-dimensional, sub-wavelength meta-atom with maximal Willis
coupling, demonstrating that the force and the torque can be reversed relative
to an equivalent symmetrical particle. By considering shape asymmetry in the
acoustic radiation force and torque, Gorkov's fundamental theory of
acoustophoresis is thereby extended. Asymmetrical shapes influence the acoustic
fields by shifting the stable trapping location, highlighting a potential for
tunable, shape-dependent particle sorting.

filtering the AFLOW-ICSD database according to the structural prototype of the
first two template systems realized in experiment. All materials show a strong
structural relaxation upon confinement to 2D which is essential to correctly
estimate the bonding strength between facets. The oxidation state of the
cations at the surface of the sheets is demonstrated to regulate the
inter-facet binding energy with low oxidation states leading to weak bonding.
We anticipate this descriptor to be highly useful to obtain novel 2D materials,
providing clear guidelines for experiments. Our calculations further indicate

machines and hazard situations) in a factory hall is on the list and expects to
be realized with massive IoT sensor deployments. In this paper, we consider
acoustic data-based anomaly detection, which is widely used in factories
because sound information reflects richer internal states while videos cannot;
besides, the capital investment of an audio system is more economically
friendly. However, a unique challenge of using audio data is that sounds are
mixed when collecting thus source data separation is inevitable. A traditional
way transfers audio data all to a centralized point for separation.
Nevertheless, such a centralized manner (i.e., data transferring and then
analyzing) may delay prompt reactions to critical anomalies. We demonstrate
that this job can be transformed into an in-network processing scheme and thus
further accelerated. Specifically, we propose a progressive processing scheme
where data separation jobs are distributed as microservices on intermediate
nodes in parallel with data forwarding. Therefore, collected audio data can be
separated 43.75% faster with even less total computing resources. This solution
is comprehensively evaluated with numerical simulations, compared with
benchmark solutions, and results justify its advantages.

multiplicatively homomorphic key management protocols (mHKMs) is presented and
analysed. Interestingly, we are able to show the equivalence between BTGs and

BTGs aim to generate the Beaver triples while MPCs to process the input data. A
new notion, which we call blind triple dispensation protocol, is then

constructed from mHKMs. We demonstrate the power of mHKMs by showing that it is

temporal motifs. This allows our algorithm to mine substantially larger motifs
with respect to alternative approaches. Furthermore, by bringing the focus on
the temporal dynamics of the interactions of a specific node, our model allows
to mine temporal motifs which are visibly interpretable. Experiments on a
number of complex networks of social interactions confirm the advantage of the
proposed approach over alternative non-egocentric solutions. The egocentric
procedure is indeed more efficient in revealing similarities and discrepancies
among different social environments, independently of the different
technologies used to collect data, which instead affect standard non-egocentric
measures.

the detection of binary black hole mergers (BBH) with highly unequal mass

The most representative of these is GW190814, a highly asymmetric merger
between a 23 M$_{\odot}$ black hole and a 2.6 M$_{\odot}$ compact object. Here,
we explore recent results suggesting that a sizeable fraction of stars with
pre-collapse carbon-oxygen core masses above 10 M$_{\odot}$, and extending up
to at least 30 M$_{\odot}$, may produce objects inside the so-called lower mass
gap that bridges the division between massive pulsars and BHs in Galactic X-ray
binaries. We demonstrate that such an explosion landscape would naturally cause
a fraction of massive binaries to produce GW190814-like systems instead of
symmetric-mass BBHs. We present examples of specific evolutionary channels
leading to the formation of GW190814 and GW200210, a 24+2.8 M$_{\odot}$ merger
discovered during the O3b observing run. We estimate the merger-rate density of
these events in our scenario to be $\mathcal{O}$(5%) of the total BBH merger
rate. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of this formation channel
for compact object populations, and its possible relevance to less asymmetric
merger events such as GW200105 and GW200115

the ion detection system primarily consisting of a resonant circuit. This
allowed shifts in its resonance frequency of up to several kHz and free
modification of its quality factor within two orders of magnitude, which
reduces the temperature of a single ion by a factor of 6. Furthermore, a
phase-sensitive detection technique for the axial ion oscillation was
implemented, which reduces the current measurement time by two orders of

uncertainties. The use of FPGA technology allowed the implementation of a
fully-featured data acquisition system, making it possible to realize feedback

from splitting in two with the application of the magnetic field.
Field-dependent magnetization at 1.8 K shows three metamagnetic transitions
with the opening of small hysteresis in different regions. A new transition at
$T_1$ emerges after the onset of the first metamagnetic transition. Complex
magnetic behavior is observed in different magnetic field regions whereas these
field regions themselves vary with the temperature. Dielectric response
recorded at zero and 80 kOe field exhibits the development of MD coupling well
above $T_N$. The MD coupling ($\sim$ 4.5 \% at 10 K) is enhanced by 25 \% as
compared to the Dy counterpart. Effect of complex magnetic behavior is also
conveyed in the MD results where the maximum value of MD coupling is observed
in the vicinity of 10 K (onset of $T_1$) and near the second metamagnetic

us to prove that general K-class estimators possess distributional robustness

level of driven realistic i.e. non-idealized plasmas. Above all, this means
giving up the well-known concept of a linear wave theory in favor of a
thoroughly nonlinear theory.
  Based on the author's early publication (H. Schamel, Plasma Phys. 14 (1972)
905) and supported by recent Vlasov-Poisson simulations of realistic noisy
plasmas, an extended framework is presented which not only covers the essential
features of coherent hole structures, but which also enables to make the
necessary corrections to the current wave theory. These corrections are long
overdue and can be briefly summarized under the heading: loss of linear Vlasov
dynamics when adequately addressing equilibrium states (i.e. failure of linear
Landau theory and of continuous van Kampen spectra, respectively). A linear
stability analysis for single harmonic waves that successfully incorporates
trapped particle effects (in contrast to previous analyses) shows an
unconditional marginal stability independent of the drift between electrons and
ions, which irrevocably contradicts Landau's theory. Moreover, holes of
negative energy are of particular interest because they act as attractors in
the dynamical system. They are the source for the release of further modes and
thus increase the level of intermittent turbulence. In summary, pattern
formation in collisionless plasmas is inherently nonlinear and kinetic.
However, to have a satisfactory, if not yet complete, understanding of its
processes a twofold paradigm shift is imperative: one from the conventional
linear, discrete wave models to the nonlinear wave models dealing with
continuous spectra due to trapping and a second from the BGK to the present
method for the correct handling of equilibria.

advancements. However, these approaches continue to rely on hand-crafted,
subsampled spectral features as input, restricting the information available to
the model. In this work, we propose WaveBeat, an end-to-end approach for joint
beat and downbeat tracking operating directly on waveforms. This method forgoes
engineered spectral features, and instead, produces beat and downbeat
predictions directly from the waveform, the first of its kind for this task.
Our model utilizes temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) operating on
waveforms that achieve a very large receptive field ($\geq$ 30 s) at audio
sample rates in a memory efficient manner by employing rapidly growing dilation
factors with fewer layers. With a straightforward data augmentation strategy,
our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on some datasets,
while producing comparable results on others, demonstrating the potential for
time domain approaches.

that can generalize well on unseen target domains. Existing DG methods mainly
learn the representations with invariant marginal distribution of the input

given the input features is more essential for unknown domain prediction.
Meanwhile, the existing of unobserved confounders which affect the input
features and labels simultaneously cause spurious correlation and hinder the
learning of the invariant relationship contained in the conditional
distribution. Interestingly, with a causal view on the data generating process,
we find that the input features of one domain are valid instrumental variables
for other domains. Inspired by this finding, we propose an instrumental
variable-driven DG method (IV-DG) by removing the bias of the unobserved
confounders with two-stage learning. In the first stage, it learns the
conditional distribution of the input features of one domain given input
features of another domain. In the second stage, it estimates the relationship
by predicting labels with the learned conditional distribution. Theoretical
analyses and simulation experiments show that it accurately captures the
invariant relationship. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that IV-DG method yields state-of-the-art results.

back-translating an attack against the compiled program to an attack against
the source program. To prove back-translation, one can syntactically translate
the target attacker to a source one -- i.e., syntax-directed back-translation
-- or show that the interaction traces of the target attacker can also be
emitted by source attackers -- i.e., trace-directed back-translation.
  Syntax-directed back-translation is not suitable when the target attacker may
use unstructured control flow that the source language cannot directly
represent. Trace-directed back-translation works with such syntactic
dissimilarity because only the external interactions of the target attacker
have to be mimicked in the source, not its internal control flow. Revealing
only external interactions is, however, inconvenient when sharing memory via
unforgeable pointers, since information about shared pointers stashed in
private memory is not present on the trace. This made prior proofs
unnecessarily complex, since the generated attacker had to instead stash all
reachable pointers.
  In this work, we introduce more informative *data-flow traces*, combining the
best of syntax- and trace-directed back-translation in a simpler technique that
handles both syntactic dissimilarity and memory sharing well, and that is
proved correct in Coq. Additionally, we develop a novel *turn-taking
simulation* relation and use it to prove a recomposition lemma, which is key to
reusing compiler correctness in such secure compilation proofs. We are the
first to mechanize such a recomposition lemma in the presence of memory
sharing.
  We use these two innovations in a secure compilation proof for a code
generation compiler pass between a source language with structured control flow
and a target language with unstructured control flow, both with safe pointers
and components.

suggests that inhomogeneous cold absorbers that give rise to the strong H I/Mg

system. It dictates the geometry both in the black hole interior and exterior
regions, as well as beyond the cosmological horizon in the Schwarzschild-dS
case. It follows that one can associate a set of non-trivial conserved charges
to the Schwarzschild-(A)dS black hole which act in each causally disconnected
regions. In T-regions, they act on fields living on spacelike hypersurface of
constant time, while in the R-region, they act on time-like hypersurface of
constant radius. We find that while the expression of the charges depend
explicitly on the location of the hypersurface, the charge algebra remains the
same at any radius in R-regions (or time in T-regions). Finally, the analysis
of the Casimirs of the charge algebra reveals a new solution-generating map.
The sl$(2,\mathbb{R})$ Casimir is shown to generate a one-parameter family of
deformation of the black hole geometry labelled by the cosmological constant.

  AIMS. The two aims of this paper are to revise the results for the sample
from paper I using Gaia EDR3 data and to expand the sample of analyzed stellar
groups to 26, from Villafranca O-001 to Villafranca O-026.
  METHODS. We use GOSSS to select Galactic stellar groups with O stars and an
updated version of the method in paper 0 of this series, combining Gaia EDR3
G+GBP+GRP photometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign
memberships and measure distances. We present 99 spectra from GOSSS and 32 from
LiLiMaRlin for stars in the analyzed groups or in their foreground.
  RESULTS. We derive distances to the 26 stellar groups with unprecedented
precision and accuracy, with total uncertainties <1% within 1 kpc and of ~3%
around 3 kpc, values that are almost 4x better than for Gaia DR2. We provide
homogeneous spectral types for 110 stars and correct a number of errors in the
literature, especially for objects in the Orion nebula cluster. For each of the
groups we discuss its membership and present possible runaway/walkaway stars.
At least two groups, Villafranca O-O12 S and Villafranca O-014 NW, are orphan
clusters in which the most massive stars have been ejected by dynamical
interactions, leaving objects with a capped mass function. The existence of
such clusters has important consequences for the study of the IMF, the
distribution of SNe across the Galaxy, and the population and dynamics of
isolated compact objects. We fit PMS isochrones to four clusters to derive ages
of 2.0$\pm$0.5 Ma for the sigma Orionis cluster, 4$\pm$2 Ma for NGC 2264,

key observation is that, because of the frequent use of synchronization
primitives, systems with strong durability can hardly utilize the extremely
high parallelism granted by modern storage devices. Thus, we explore the notion
of weakly durable transactions, and discuss how to safely relax durability
without compromising other transactional properties. We present AciKV, a
transactional system whose design is centered around weak durability. AciKV
exposes to users the normal transactional interface, but what sets it apart
from others is a new ""persist"" primitive that decouples durability from commit.
AciKV is a middle ground between systems that perform fast atomic operations,
and ones that support transactions; this middle ground is useful as it provides
similar performance to the former, while prevents isolation and consistency
anomalies like the latter. Our evaluation using the YCSB benchmark shows that
AciKV, under workloads that involve write requests, exhibits more than two
orders of magnitude higher throughput than existing strongly durable systems.

detected when considering planets with radii between 1 and 4 $R_\oplus$.
However, these same planets show a bimodal radius distribution, with few
planets between 1.5 and 2 $R_{\oplus}$. The smaller ""super-Earths"" are
consistent with being stripped rocky cores, while the larger ""sub-Neptunes""
likely have gaseous H/He envelopes. Given these distinct structures, it is
worthwhile to test for intra-system uniformity separately within each category
of planets. Here, we find that the tendency for intra-system uniformity is
twice as strong when considering planets within the same size category than it
is when combining all planets together. The sub-Neptunes tend to be
$1.7^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$ times larger than the super-Earths in the same system,
corresponding to an envelope mass fraction of about 2.6% for a $5\,M_{\oplus}$
planet. For the sub-Neptunes, the low-metallicity stars are found to have
planets with more equal sizes, with modest statistical significance ($p\sim
0.005$). There is also a modest $(\sim$2-$\sigma)$ tendency for wider-orbiting
planets to be larger, even within the same size category.

dataset that can be currently used to determine stellar distances in the solar
neighborhood. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement in their
calibration and systematic effects can be further reduced in some
circumstances.
  AIMS. The aim of this paper is to determine an improved Gaia EDR3 parallax
bias as a function of magnitude, color, and ecliptic latitude using a single
method applied to stars in open clusters, globular clusters, the LMC, and the
SMC.
  METHODS. I study the behavior of the residuals or differences between the
individual (stellar) parallaxes and the group parallaxes, which are assumed
constant for the corresponding cluster or galaxy. This is done by first
applying the Lindegren et al. (2021) zero point and then calculating a new zero
point from the residuals of the first analysis.
  RESULTS. The Lindegren zero point shows very small residuals as a function of
magnitude between individual and group parallaxes for G < 13 but significant
ones for brighter stars, especially blue ones. The new zero point reduces those
residuals, especially in the 9.2 < G < 13 range. The k factor that is used to
convert from catalog parallax uncertainties to external uncertainties is small
(1.1-1.7) for 9.2 < G < 11 and G > 13, intermediate (1.7-2.0) for 11 < G < 13,
and large (>2.0) for G <9.2. Therefore, significant corrections are needed to
calculate distance uncertainties from Gaia EDR3 parallaxes for some stars.
There is still room for improvement if future analyses add information from
additional stellar clusters, especially for red stars with G < 11 and blue
stars with G < 9.2. I also calculate k for stars with RUWE values between 1.4
and 8.0 and for stars with 6-parameter solutions, allowing for a correct
estiimation of their uncertainties.

whether standard CNNs can support human-like online invariance by training
models to recognize images of synthetic 3D objects that undergo several
transformations: rotation, scaling, translation, brightness, contrast, and
viewpoint. Through the analysis of models' internal representations, we show
that standard supervised CNNs trained on transformed objects can acquire strong
invariances on novel classes even when trained with as few as 50 objects taken
from 10 classes. This extended to a different dataset of photographs of real
objects. We also show that these invariances can be acquired in a
self-supervised way, through solving the same/different task. We suggest that
this latter approach may be similar to how humans acquire invariances.

an automated biasing technique that enables the rapid acquisition of molecular

leveraged this approach to sample the free energy landscapes of DNA

good agreement with experiments. Our results establish an efficient framework

at some scales and consequently leads to the PBHs production with different
mass scales. We implement the computational code BINGO which calculates the
non-Gaussianity parameter in different triangle configurations. Our examination
implies that in this setup, the non-Gaussianity gets amplified significantly in
the equilateral shape around the scales in which the power spectrum of the
scalar perturbations undergoes a sharp declination. The imprints of these
non-Gaussianities can be probed in the scales corresponding to the BBN and
$\mu$-distortion events, or in smaller scales, and detection of such signatures

of the most massive stars are lost, we are left with an orphan cluster.
  AIMS. We study the Bermuda cluster (Villafranca O-014 NW), the most
significant young stellar group in the North America and Pelican nebulae, and
the massive stars that may have been ejected from it to test if it has been
orphaned.
  METHODS. We use Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and proper motions to search for
walkaway/runaway stars in the vicinity of the North America and Pelican
nebulae. The candidates are analyzed with spectroscopy and photometry to assess
their nature and their trajectories are traced back in time to determine at
what time they left the Bermuda cluster.
  RESULTS. We detect three ejection events (Bajamar, Toronto, and HD 201 795
events) that expelled 5, 2, and 2 systems, respectively, or 6, 3, and 3 stars
if we count the individual components in spectroscopic/eclipsing binaries. The
events took place 1.611$\pm$0.011 Ma, 1.496$\pm$0.044 Ma, and 1.905$\pm$0.037
Ma ago, respectively, but our analysis is marginally consistent with the first
two being simultaneous. We detect bow shocks in WISE images associated with
four of the ejected systems. Combining the three events, the Bermuda cluster
has lost >200 M_Sol, including its three most massive stars, so it can be
considered an orphan cluster. One consequence is that the PDMF of the cluster
has been radically altered from its top-heavy initial value to one compatible
with a Kroupa-like function. Another one is that the cluster is currently
expanding with a dynamical time scale consistent with the cause being the
ejection events. A scenario in which the Bermuda cluster was formed in a
conveyor belt fashion over several hundreds of ka or even 1 Ma is consistent
with all the observables.

well-founded pairing that is universal in the sense that any (almost)
well-founded pairing is isomorphic to a transitive subobject of this one. In
particular, if an axiom system includes the axiom of foundation then all models
of it are equivalent to such subobjects. The universal well-founded pairing
satisfies the Zermillo-Fraenkel-Choice axioms, minus first-order logic, so it
is also the maximal such theory. Maximality follows from the fact that its
``universe'' does not support quantification.
  We apply universality to show that a ZFC theory is either a truncation of the
maximal theory, or there is a ZFC set with a bijection to a subdomain of its
universe that is not a ZFC set.

assess their dependence on temperature, which can dramatically determine the

  Through Spontaneous Speech","Accepted by NCMMSC2021",,,,"eess.AS q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and
recently attracts extensive attention worldwide. Speech technology is
considered a promising solution for the early diagnosis of AD and has been
enthusiastically studied. Most recent works concentrate on the use of advanced
BERT-like classifiers for AD detection. Input to these classifiers are speech
transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. The major
challenge is that the quality of transcription could degrade significantly
under complex acoustic conditions in the real world. The detection performance,
in consequence, is largely limited. This paper tackles the problem via
tailoring and adapting pre-trained neural-network based ASR model for the
downstream AD recognition task. Only bottom layers of the ASR model are
retained. A simple fully-connected neural network is added on top of the
tailored ASR model for classification. The heavy BERT classifier is discarded.
The resulting model is light-weight and can be fine-tuned in an end-to-end
manner for AD recognition. Our proposed approach takes only raw speech as
input, and no extra transcription process is required. The linguistic
information of speech is implicitly encoded in the tailored ASR model and
contributes to boosting the performance. Experiments show that our proposed
approach outperforms the best manual transcript-based RoBERTa by an absolute
margin of 4.6% in terms of accuracy. Our best-performing models achieve the
accuracy of 83.2% and 78.0% in the long-audio and short-audio competition

  case for disaggregated evaluations",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Underspecification and fairness in machine learning (ML) applications have
recently become two prominent issues in the ML community. Acoustic scene
classification (ASC) applications have so far remained unaffected by this
discussion, but are now becoming increasingly used in real-world systems where
fairness and reliability are critical aspects. In this work, we argue for the
need of a more holistic evaluation process for ASC models through disaggregated
evaluations. This entails taking into account performance differences across
several factors, such as city, location, and recording device. Although these
factors play a well-understood role in the performance of ASC models, most
works report single evaluation metrics taking into account all different strata
of a particular dataset. We argue that metrics computed on specific
sub-populations of the underlying data contain valuable information about the
expected real-world behaviour of proposed systems, and their reporting could
improve the transparency and trustability of such systems. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed evaluation process in uncovering
underspecification and fairness problems exhibited by several standard ML
architectures when trained on two widely-used ASC datasets. Our evaluation
shows that all examined architectures exhibit large biases across all factors
taken into consideration, and in particular with respect to the recording
location. Additionally, different architectures exhibit different biases even
though they are trained with the same experimental configurations.

  trajectories of motor neurodegeneration in ALS",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Longitudinal fMRI datasets hold great promise for the study of
neurodegenerative diseases, but realizing their potential depends on extracting
accurate fMRI-based brain measures in individuals over time. This is especially
true for rare, heterogeneous and/or rapidly progressing diseases, which often
involve small samples whose functional features may vary dramatically across
subjects and over time, making traditional group-difference analyses of limited
utility. One such disease is ALS, which results in extreme motor function loss
and eventual death. Here, we analyze a rich longitudinal dataset containing 190
motor task fMRI scans from 16 ALS patients and 22 age-matched HCs. We propose a
novel longitudinal extension to our cortical surface-based spatial Bayesian
GLM, which has high power and precision to detect activations in individuals.
Using a series of longitudinal mixed-effects models to subsequently study the
relationship between activation and disease progression, we observe an inverted
U-shaped trajectory: at relatively mild disability we observe enlarging
activations, while at higher disability we observe severely diminished
activation, reflecting progression toward complete motor function loss. We
observe distinct trajectories depending on clinical progression rate, with
faster progressors exhibiting more extreme hyper-activation and subsequent
hypo-activation. These differential trajectories suggest that initial
hyper-activation is likely attributable to loss of inhibitory neurons. By
contrast, earlier studies employing more limited sampling designs and using
traditional group-difference analysis approaches were only able to observe the
initial hyper-activation, which was assumed to be due to a compensatory
process. This study provides a first example of how surface-based spatial
Bayesian modeling furthers scientific understanding of neurodegenerative
disease.

observed that most of the heat flux is confined to a narrow region at the

and the possible emergence of collective behaviours in a mechanically stable
elastic solid remains elusive. Here we introduce a minimal realization of an
active elastic solid, in which we characterize the emergence of selective and
collective actuation and fully map out the interplay between activity,
elasticity and geometry. Polar active agents exert forces on the nodes of a two
dimensional elastic lattice. The resulting displacement field nonlinearly
reorients the active agents. For large enough coupling, a collective
oscillation of the lattice nodes around their equilibrium position emerges.
Only a few elastic modes are actuated and, crucially, they are not necessarily
the lowest energy ones. Combining experiments with the numerical and
theoretical analysis of an agents model, we unveil the bifurcation scenario and
the selection mechanism by which the collective actuation takes place. Our
findings may provide a new mechanism for oscillatory dynamics in biological
tissues and specifically confluent cell monolayers. The present selection
mechanism may also be advantageous in providing meta-materials, with bona fide
autonomy.

intermittent bursty dynamics with applications to physical, seismic, epidemic,

feedback loops that may lead to critical phenomena in complex systems, the
standard linear Hawkes process only describes excitative phenomena. To describe
the co-existence of excitatory and inhibitory effects (or negative feedbacks),
extensions involving nonlinear dependences of the intensity as a function of
past activity are needed. However, such nonlinear Hawkes processes have been
found hitherto to be analytically intractable due to the interplay between
their non-Markovian and nonlinear characteristics, with no analytical solutions
available. Here, we present various exact and robust asymptotic solutions to
nonlinear Hawkes processes using the field master equation approach. We report
explicit power law formulas for the steady state intensity distributions
$P_{\mathrm{ss}}(\lambda)\propto \lambda^{-1-a}$, where the tail exponent $a$
is expressed analytically as a function of parameters of the nonlinear Hawkes
models. We present three robust interesting characteristics of the nonlinear
Hawkes process: (i) for one-sided positive marks (i.e., in the absence of
inhibitory effects), the nonlinear Hawkes process can exhibit any power law
relation either as intermediate asymptotics ($a\leq 0$) or as true asymptotics
($a>0$) by appropriate model selection; (ii) for distribution of marks with
zero mean (i.e., for balanced excitatory and inhibitory effects), the Zipf law
($a\approx 1$) is universally observed for a wide class of nonlinear Hawkes
processes with fast-accelerating intensity map; (iii) for marks with a negative
mean, the asymptotic power law tail becomes lighter with an exponent increasing
above 1 ($a>1$) as the mean mark becomes more negative.

  Using the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) optical spectra of nine bright
M31 PNe were obtained: four of them at the tip of the PNLF, and the other five
some 0.5 magnitudes fainter. A control sample of 21 PNe with previous GTC
spectra from literature is also included. Their physical properties and
chemical abundances (He, N, O, Ar, Ne and S) are analysed. The central star
masses are estimated with Cloudy modelling using the most recent evolutionary
tracks.
  The studied PNe show a remarkable uniformity in all their nebular properties,
the brightest PNe showing relatively large electron densities. Stellar
characteristics also span a narrow range: ${<L_{*}/L_{\odot}> = 4300 \pm 310,
<Teff> = 122000 \pm 10600 K}$ for the central stars of the four brightest PNe,
and ${<L_{*}/L_{\odot}> = 3300 \pm 370, < Teff> = 135000 \pm 26000 K}$ for
those in the control set. This groups all the brightest PNe at the location of
maximum temperature in the post-AGB tracks for stars with initial masses ${M =
1.5 M_{\odot}}$.
  These figures provide robust observational constraints about the stellar
progenitors producing the PNLF cutoff in a star-forming galaxy such as M31,
where a large range of initial masses is in principle available. Inconsistency
is found, however, in the computed N/O abundance ratios of five nebulae, which
are 1.5 to 3 times larger than predicted by the existing models for stars of
these masses.

connection point due to decommissioning of synchronous generation plants
causing system strength issues in wind power plants. Whereas wind power plant
rating and export cable length are increasing, further weakening the system
strength and accompanied by stability challenges. Under such a scenario, a grid
forming control demonstrated to operate in a weaker system has value creation
potential for application in wind turbine generators. In addition, the grid
forming control can also enable a wind power plant to operate in islanded mode,
provide inertially and phase jump active power support. However, the
application of grid forming control has challenges because grid forming control
applied to a power converter (GFC) has a voltage source behavior and does not
stiffly control the grid side active power and thus requires a separate current
limiting mechanism. However, there could be potential challenges in maintaining
the synchronism of GFC when the current limit is triggered, particularly during
the grid voltage phase jump event. Modeling and capturing such a phenomenon is
a challenge in a wind farm with many wind turbines. To that end, this paper
investigates the modeling adequacy of the aggregated GFC-WF to a single GF-WTG
of total WF rating in capturing GFC-WF dynamics. The challenges related to loss
of synchronization stability when one or more wind turbine generators enter
current limited operation during a grid phase jump events are also evaluated in

that having perfect execution with the empirical shot selection strategy is
roughly equivalent to choosing one or two optimal shots with average execution

forehand shots, and that optimal shot selection on a serve return is more
valuable than on any other shot, over all values of execution error.

defined in terms of encoders, which map queries and documents into a
representational space, and a comparison function that computes query-document

scoring model can be further analyzed along two dimensions: dense vs. sparse
representations and supervised (learned) vs. unsupervised approaches. I show
that many recently proposed retrieval methods, including multi-stage ranking
designs, can be seen as different parameterizations in this framework, and that
a unified view suggests a number of open research questions, providing a
roadmap for future work. As a bonus, this conceptual framework establishes

the Coand\u{a} effect and has many potential technical applications. The aim of
this thesis is to assess how well Computational Fluid Dynamics can capture it.
A Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach with a 2-dimensional domain was
first used to simulate an offset jet on a flat plane. Whether it was for
$k-\omega$ SST or $k-\epsilon$ turbulence model, a good prediction of the flow
was found. Since it is known that streamline curvature can have an important
impact on the numerical results, a jet blown tangentially to a cylinder was
then considered. Using the same approach as for the flat plane, with $k-\omega$
SST turbulence model, some of the flow features such as the separation location
or velocity profiles near the jet exit were accurately predicted. However, the
jet development was overall poorly captured. A Curvature Correction was then
introduced in the turbulence model and if it did slightly improve the jet
development, the negative impact on other quantities makes its benefits
questionable. Due to the known presence of longitudinal and spanwise vortices
in the flow, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach with a 3-dimensional
domain was attempted but was only able to reproduce the 2-dimensional results.
Although if the longitudinal vortices are artificially generated at the inlet,
their development is supported by the simulation. Finally, since the
shortcomings of the numerical results obtained might be due to limitations of
the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach, a Large Eddy Simulation was
attempted. Unfortunately, due to time and computational restrictions a fully
developed flow could not be obtained, the methodology and preliminary results
are however presented.

also needs to plan how to distribute the production across the different plants
under his control. The two decisions, namely the sales-mix and the generation

depends, among other things, by the amount of the energy that the producer
directs on the spot market. We develop a risk management problem, since we
consider an optimization problem combining a trade-off between expectation and
conditional value at risk of the profit function of the producer. The sources
of uncertainty are relatively large and encompass demand, renewables generation
and the fuel costs of conventional plants. We also model endogenously the price

  Cloud and Edge servers",,,,,"eess.SP cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) enable converting the brain electrical
activity of an interface user to the user commands. BCI research studies
demonstrated encouraging results in different areas such as
neurorehabilitation, control of artificial limbs, control of computer
environments, communication and detection of diseases. Most of BCIs use
scalp-electroencephalography (EEG), which is a non-invasive method to capture
the brain activity. Although EEG monitoring devices are available in the
market, these devices are generally lab-oriented and expensive. Day-to-day use
of BCIs is impractical at this time due to the complex techniques required for
data preprocessing and signal analysis. This implies that BCI technologies
should be improved to facilitate its widespread adoption in Cloud and Edge
datacenters. This paper presents a case study on profiling the accuracy and
performance of a brain-computer interface which runs on typical Cloud and Edge
servers. In particular, we investigate how the accuracy and execution time of
the preprocessing phase, i.e. the brain signal filtering phase, of a
brain-computer interface varies when processing static and live streaming data
obtained in real time BCI devices. We identify the optimal size of the packets
for sampling brain signals which provides the best trade-off between the
accuracy and performance. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of using
typical Cloud and Edge servers to perform the BCI filtering phase.

reaction could reach up to 100%. Taking place inside the aggregates, ASR
imposes internal pressure on the surrounding material. In the current paper, we
study the possibility of crack growth due to such internal loading. This study
is done by employing a semi-analytical mechanical model comprising an elastic
solution to a well-known Eshelby problem and a linear elastic fracture
mechanics solution to a ring-shaped crack encircling a spheroidal inclusion.
The proposed method implies the availability of pre-existing micro-fissures
within the aggregate.
  The study reveals dependence of the crack growing potential on the spheroid's
shape: the larger is the ASR pocket - the longer crack it can open. Two most
critical shapes, causing a highest stress intensity factor and developing the
longest crack, are a sphere and a spheroid with 1/4 aspect ratio respectively.
The size analysis of the problem suggests a critical spheroid's radius below
which no crack growth is expected. For a chosen material properties and
expansion value, such radius lays in the range between 0.1 and 1 micrometer.
Independently of the expansion value and the shape of the pocket of ASR
product, the maximum crack length has a power-law dependence on the size of a
spheroid.
  All the theoretical predictions are confirmed by a numerical model based on
the combination of the finite element method and cohesive element approach.

is to prevent accountability. This prevention of accountability can be
problematic, for example, if it leads to delinquents remaining undetected.
However, imputability can also provide protection against discrimination. In
medical, religious or legal matters, this is of fundamental importance. Thus,
when individuals actively establish anonymity, they do so mostly because they
want to prevent certain information about them, that is, sensitive and/or
compromising information, from being associated with their identities. By
remaining inaccessible as individuals with respect to certain information about
them, they can engage in forms of exchange that would otherwise be impossible
for them. Examples include practices of exchange in (self-organized) therapy
groups, acting out stigmatized sexual preferences, the role of anonymity in the
performing arts, or political resistance movements. Given the variety of
examples in which personal anonymity is important, it is not surprising that it
is primarily these personal dimensions that are the focus of current debates
about the increasing precariousness of anonymity in the face of new technical
possibilities of data mining and processing. In this paper, we nevertheless -
or precisely because of this - want to focus on another aspect of anonymity
that has received much less attention so far. Namely, we assume that
researching and working with and about anonymity can open up new perspectives
on and for contemporary forms of knowledge production.

  Strain rate dependency and Fragmentation","32 Pages, 11 Figures and 3 Tables",,,,"physics.geo-ph astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The scope of this study is to understand the strength behaviour and fragment
size of rocks during indirect, quasi-static, and dynamic tensile tests. Four
rocks with different lithological characteristics namely, basalt, granite,
sandstone and marble are selected. The Brazilian disc experiments are performed
over a range of strain rates from 10-5 /s to 2.7x101 /s using a hydraulic
loading frame and a split-Hopkinson bar. Over the range of strain rates, our
measurements of dynamic strength increase are in good agreement with the
universal theoretical scaling relationship of Kimberley et al. (2013). Dynamic
fragmentation during a split tension mode receives very little attention and
not much information is available about the generated fragment size
distributions. The fragments fall into two distinct groups based on the nature
of failure, coarser primary fragments and finer secondary fragments. The degree
of fragmentation is assessed in terms of characteristic strain rate and is
compared with existing theoretical tensile fragmentation models. The primary
fragment size are less sensitive to strain rate, particularly at lower strain
rates. The size of secondary fragment has a strong strain rate dependency over
the entire testing range. Marble and sandstone are found to generate more
pulverized secondary debris when compared to basalt and granite. Further, it is
shown that the mean fragment sizes of primary and secondary fragments are well
described by a power law function of strain rate.

interfering destructively with the density gradient component, thus lowering
the total diamagnetic current density. This effect is most pronounced on the
