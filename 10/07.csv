We show that SLGP models induced by continuous GPs can be characterized by the

repeated highly accurate sensor scanning. ILC asks for zero error for a finite
time tracking maneuver, containing initial transients each iteration. The
purpose of this paper is to create a method of designing ILC compensators based
on steady state frequency response, and have the ILC converge to zero error in

that this matrix gives the steady state frequency response of the system at the
finite number of frequencies observable in the finite data sequence of an

higher reliability. Hence, relevant test cases are best explored using scalable

twelve representative DR techniques that cover the concerned properties. Four
controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate how the DR techniques
facilitate the tasks of 1) cluster identification, 2) membership
identification, 3) distance comparison, and 4) density comparison,
respectively. We also evaluated users' subjective preference of the DR
techniques regarding the quality of projected clusters. The results show that:
1) Non-linear and Local techniques are preferred in cluster identification and
membership identification; 2) Linear techniques perform better than non-linear
techniques in density comparison; 3) UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) perform the
best in cluster identification and membership identification; 4) NMF
(Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) has competitive performance in distance
comparison; 5) t-SNLE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Linear Embedding) has
competitive performance in density comparison.

all frequencies from zero to Nyquist. Adjustment of gains must near the

The other approach uses a circulant matrix obtained from the Toeplitz matrix of
Markov parameters. It is shown to give steady state frequency response for the
discrete frequencies that can be seen in the number of time steps in the ILC

A second aim is to learn from successful ILC designs to enhances stability

studied as an alternative method to eliminate instability of the control action

  Our main result is a coreset for kernel $k$-Means that works for a general

ingredient in cloth manipulation. The large variability of cloth deformations
has motivated most of the current approaches to focus on identifying specific
grasping points rather than semantic parts, as the appearance and depth
variations of local regions are smaller and easier to model than the larger
ones. However, tasks like cloth folding or assisted dressing require
recognising larger segments, such as semantic edges that carry more information
than points. The first goal of this paper is therefore to tackle the problem of
fine-grained region detection in deformed clothes using only a depth image. As
a proof of concept, we implement an approach for T-shirts, and define up to 6
semantic regions of varying extent, including edges on the neckline, sleeve
cuffs, and hem, plus top and bottom grasping points. We introduce a U-net based
network to segment and label these parts. The second contribution of our work
is concerned with the level of supervision that we require to train the
proposed network. While most approaches learn to detect grasping points by
combining real and synthetic annotations, in this work we defy the limitations
of the synthetic data, and propose a multilayered domain adaptation (DA)
strategy that does not use real annotations at all. We thoroughly evaluate our
approach on real depth images of a T-shirt annotated with fine-grained labels.
We show that training our network solely with synthetic data and the proposed
DA yields results competitive with models trained on real data.

is that the magnitude of neuromagnetic fields is several orders of magnitude
lower than interfering signals. Recently, a new type of sensor has been
developed - the optically pumped magnetometer (OPM). These sensors can be
placed directly on the scalp and move with the head during participant
movement, making them wearable. This opens up a range of exciting experimental
and clinical opportunities for OPM-based MEG experiments, including paediatric
studies, and the incorporation of naturalistic movements into neuroimaging
paradigms. However, OPMs face some unique challenges in terms of interference
suppression, especially in situations involving mobile participants, and when
OPMs are integrated with electrical equipment required for naturalistic
paradigms, such as motion capture systems. Here we briefly review various
hardware solutions for OPM interference suppression. We then outline several
signal processing strategies aimed at increasing the signal from neuromagnetic
sources. These include regression-based strategies, temporal filtering and
spatial filtering approaches. The focus is on the practical application of
these signal processing algorithms to OPM data. In a similar vein, we include
two worked-through experiments using OPM data collected from a whole-head
sensor array. These tutorial-style examples illustrate how the steps for
suppressing external interference can be implemented, including the associated
data and code so that researchers can try the pipelines for themselves. With
the popularity of OPM-based MEG rising, there will be an increasing need to
deal with interference suppression. We hope this practical paper provides a
resource for OPM-based MEG researchers to build upon.

arguments for supporting their decisions. The study findings revealed that
developers tend to look from different perspectives even when they agree about
the incidence of a code smell. After coding the 303 arguments given into

instead an approximate exploration methodology based on fitting only two point
estimates, one tuned and one overfit. The approach, which we term the residual
overfit method of exploration (ROME), drives exploration towards actions where
the overfit model exhibits the most overfitting compared to the tuned model.
The intuition is that overfitting occurs the most at actions and contexts with
insufficient data to form accurate predictions of the reward. We justify this
intuition formally from both a frequentist and a Bayesian information theoretic
perspective. The result is a method that generalizes to a wide variety of
models and avoids the computational overhead of resampling or posterior

been the core of research in pursuing next-generation logic applications beyond
the silicon technology. Yet the opening of a gap in a controllable range of
doping, whilst keeping high conductance outside of this gapped state, has
remained a grand challenge in them thus far. Here we show that, by bringing
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene in contact with an anti-ferromagnetic insulator
CrOCl, a strong insulating behavior is observed in a wide range of positive
total electron doping $n_\mathrm{tot}$ and effective displacement field
$D_\mathrm{eff}$ at low temperatures. Transport measurements further prove that
such an insulating phase can be well described by the picture of an inter-layer
excitonic state in bilayer graphene owing to electron-hole interactions. The
consequential over 1 $\mathrm{G\Omega}$ excitonic insulator can be readily
killed by tuning $D_\mathrm{eff}$ and/or $n_\mathrm{tot}$, and the system
recovers to a high mobility graphene with a sheet resistance of less than 100
$\mathrm{\Omega}$. It thus yields transistors with ""ON-OFF"" ratios reaching
10$^{7}$, and a CMOS-like graphene logic inverter is demonstrated. Our findings
of the robust insulating phase in bilayer graphene may be a leap forward to

most hundreds of actions at each decision point. In contrast, Diplomacy is a

address games with large branching factors, such as Diplomacy, StarCraft, and
Dota, used human data to bootstrap the policy or used handcrafted reward
shaping. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for action exploration and
equilibrium approximation in games with combinatorial action spaces. This
algorithm simultaneously performs value iteration while learning a policy
proposal network. A double oracle step is used to explore additional actions to
add to the policy proposals. At each state, the target state value and policy
for the model training are computed via an equilibrium search procedure. Using
this algorithm, we train an agent, DORA, completely from scratch for a popular
two-player variant of Diplomacy and show that it achieves superhuman
performance. Additionally, we extend our methods to full-scale no-press
Diplomacy and for the first time train an agent from scratch with no human
data. We present evidence that this agent plays a strategy that is incompatible
with human-data bootstrapped agents. This presents the first strong evidence of
multiple equilibria in Diplomacy and suggests that self play alone may be
insufficient for achieving superhuman performance in Diplomacy.

liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins with multiple modular
domains, which can be folded or conformationally disordered to various degrees.
To understand the LLPS-driving domain-domain interactions, a fundamental
question is how readily the interactions in the condensed phase can be inferred
from inter-domain interactions in dilute solutions. In particular, are the
interactions leading to LLPS exclusively those underlying the formation of
discrete inter-domain complexes in homogeneous solutions? We address this
question by developing a mean-field LLPS theory of two stoichiometrically
constrained solute species. The theory is applied to the neuronal proteins
SynGAP and PSD-95, whose complex coacervate serves as a rudimentary model for
neuronal postsynaptic densities (PSDs). The predicted phase behaviors are
compared with experiments. Previously, a three-SynGAP, two-PSD-95 ratio was
determined for SynGAP/PSD-95 complexes in dilute solutions. However, when this
3:2 stoichiometry is uniformly imposed in our theory encompassing both dilute
and condensed phases, the tie-line pattern of the predicted SynGAP/PSD-95 phase
diagram differs drastically from that obtained experimentally. In contrast,
theories embodying alternate scenarios postulating auxiliary SynGAP-PSD-95 as
well as SynGAP-SynGAP and PSD-95-PSD-95 interactions in addition to those
responsible for stoichiometric SynGAP/PSD-95 complexes produce tie-line
patterns consistent with experiment. Hence, our combined
theoretical-experimental analysis indicates that weaker interactions or
higher-order complexes beyond the 3:2 stoichiometry, but not yet documented,
are involved in the formation of SynGAP/PSD-95 condensates, imploring future
efforts to ascertain the nature of these auxiliary interactions in PSD-like
LLPS.

Ultra-reliable Low Latency Communication is primarily characterized by
communication that provides ultra-high reliability and very low latency to

While the reduction in PHY layer overhead and improvement in channel coding
techniques are pivotal in reducing latency and improving reliability, the
current wireless standards dedicated to support mcMTC rely heavily on adopting
the bottom layers of general-purpose wireless standards and customizing only
the upper layers. The mcMTC has a significant technical impact on the design of
all layers of the communication protocol stack. In this paper, an innovative
bottom-up approach has been proposed for mcMTC applications through PHY layer
targeted at improving the transmission reliability by implementing
ultra-reliable channel coding scheme in the PHY layer of IEEE 802.11a bearing
in mind short packet transmission system. To achieve this aim, we analyzed and
compared the channel coding performance of convolutional codes, LDPC codes, and
polar codes in wireless network on the condition of short data packet
transmission. The Viterbi decoding algorithm, logarithmic belief propagation
algorithm, and cyclic redundancy check - successive cancellation list decoding
algorithm were adopted to CC, LDPC codes, and polar codes, respectively.
Consequently, a new PHY layer for mcMTC has been proposed. The reliability of
the proposed approach has been validated by simulation in terms of Bit error
rate vs. SNR. The simulation results demonstrate that the reliability of IEEE
802.11a standard has been significantly improved to be at PER less 10e-5 with
the implementation of polar codes. The results also show that the
general-purpose wireless networks are prominent in providing short packet mcMTC

(MVS) techniques for 3D reconstruction and a non-rigid registration step to
establish dense correspondence across identities and expressions. A common
problem is the need for manual clean-up after the MVS step, as 3D scans are
typically affected by noise and outliers and contain hairy surface regions that
need to be cleaned up by artists. Furthermore, mesh registration tends to fail
for extreme facial expressions. Most learning-based methods use an underlying
3D morphable model (3DMM) to ensure robustness, but this limits the output
accuracy for extreme facial expressions. In addition, the global bottleneck of
regression architectures cannot produce meshes that tightly fit the ground
truth surfaces. We propose ToFu, Topologically consistent Face from multi-view,
a geometry inference framework that can produce topologically consistent meshes
across facial identities and expressions using a volumetric representation
instead of an explicit underlying 3DMM. Our novel progressive mesh generation
network embeds the topological structure of the face in a feature volume,
sampled from geometry-aware local features. A coarse-to-fine architecture
facilitates dense and accurate facial mesh predictions in a consistent mesh
topology. ToFu further captures displacement maps for pore-level geometric
details and facilitates high-quality rendering in the form of albedo and
specular reflectance maps. These high-quality assets are readily usable by
production studios for avatar creation, animation and physically-based skin
rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art geometric and correspondence
accuracy, while only taking 0.385 seconds to compute a mesh with 10K vertices,
which is three orders of magnitude faster than traditional techniques. The code

resonances MMR's), only agrees with numerical simulations at a very crude
level. (ii) Much greater accuracy is attained by considering neighboring MMR's
that do not overlap. We work out the width of the chaotic zones around each of
the neighbors, and also provide simple approximate expressions for the widths.
(iii) Even greater accuracy is provided by the overlap of three-body resonances
(3BR's), which accounts for fine-grained structure seen in maps from N-body
simulations, and also predicts the Lyapunov times. Previous studies conflict on
whether overlap of MMR's or of 3BR's drive interplanetary chaos. We show that
both do, and in fact they are merely different ways of looking at the same
effect. (iv) We compare both criteria with high-resolution maps of chaos from
N-body simulations, and show that they agree at a high level of detail.

can explore using chemical abundances of halo stars to study the star formation
and chemical enrichment histories of the dwarf galaxy progenitors of the Milky
Way (MW) and M31 stellar halos. In this paper, we investigate using the
Chemical Abundance Ratio Distributions (CARDs) of seven stellar halos from the
Latte suite of FIRE-2 simulations. We attempt to infer galaxies' assembly
histories by modelling the CARDs of the stellar halos of the Latte galaxies as
a linear combination of template CARDs from disrupted dwarfs, with different
stellar masses $M_{\star}$ and quenching times $t_{100}$. We present a method
for constructing these templates using present-day dwarf galaxies. For four of
the seven Latte halos studied in this work, we recover the mass spectrum of
accreted dwarfs to a precision of $<10\%$. For the fraction of mass accreted as
a function of $t_{100}$, we find residuals of $20-30\%$ for five of the seven
simulations. We discuss the failure modes of this method, which arise from the
diversity of star formation and chemical enrichment histories dwarf galaxies
can take. These failure cases can be robustly identified by the high model
residuals. Though the CARDs modeling method does not successfully infer the
assembly histories in these cases, the CARDs of these disrupted dwarfs contain
signatures of their unusual formation histories. Our results are promising for
using CARDs to learn more about the histories of the progenitors of the MW and
M31 stellar halos.

ShadowQPT allows for the reconstruction of the Choi matrix for unitary and

Both the theoretical scaling for large systems and the practicality of using
shadow tomography on NISQ-era hardware are considered. Our algorithms have been

context of large-volume cosmological simulations. The THESAN project offers a
unique framework for addressing such limitations by combining state-of-the-art
galaxy formation (IllustrisTNG) and dust models with the Arepo-RT
radiation-magneto-hydrodynamics solver. In this initial study we present
Lyman-alpha centric analysis for the flagship simulation that resolves atomic
cooling haloes throughout a (95.5 cMpc)^3 region of the Universe. To avoid
numerical artifacts we devise a novel method for accurate frequency-dependent
line radiative transfer in the presence of continuous Hubble flow, transferable
to broader astrophysical applications as well. Our scalable approach highlights
the utility of LAEs and red damping-wing transmission as probes of
reionization, which reveal nontrivial trends across different galaxies,
sightlines, and frequency bands that can be modelled in the framework of
covering fractions. In fact, after accounting for environmental factors
influencing large-scale ionized bubble formation such as redshift and UV
magnitude, the variation across galaxies and sightlines mainly depends on
random processes including peculiar velocities and self-shielded systems that
strongly impact unfortunate rays more than others. Throughout the EoR local and
cosmological optical depths are often greater than or less than unity such that
the exp(-tau) behavior leads to anisotropic and bimodal transmissivity. Future
surveys will benefit by targeting both rare bright objects and Goldilocks zone
LAEs to infer the presence of these (un)predictable (dis)advantages.

control the fermion incoherence to systematically examine various normal states

all pairing channels show instabilities with the spin-independent interactions.
Although the interactions shorten the lifetime of the fermions in the non-Fermi

growth of planet cores inside and outside of the snow line. A smaller pebble
size interior to the snow line delays the growth of super-Earths, allowing
giant planet cores in the outer disk to form first. When those giant planets
reach pebble isolation mass they cut off the flow of pebbles to the inner disk
and prevent the formation of close-in super-Earths. We apply this model to
stars with masses between 0.1 and 2 solar mass and for a range of initial disk
masses. We find that the masses of hot super-Earths and of cold giant planets
are anti-correlated. The fraction of our simulations that form hot super-Earths
is higher around lower-mass stars and matches the exoplanet occurrence rates
from Kepler. The fraction of simulations forming cold giant planets is
consistent with the stellar mass dependence from radial velocity surveys. A key
testable prediction of the pebble accretion hypothesis is that the occurrence
rates of super-Earths should decrease again for M dwarfs near the sub-stellar

sharpen this relationship by deriving disordered local Hamiltonians
generalizing the critical Ising model whose ground and low-energy excited

particle physics. Their power is increased when they can isolate different
event classes, e.g., by flavor, though that is not the only possibility. Here
we focus on a new event class for neutrino telescopes: dimuons, two energetic
muons from one neutrino interaction. We make new theoretical and observational
contributions. For the theoretical part, we calculate dimuon-production cross
sections and detection prospects via deep-inelastic scattering (DIS; where we
greatly improve upon prior work) and $W$-boson production (WBP; where we
present first results). We show that IceCube should have $\simeq 130$ dimuons
($\simeq 6$ from WBP) in its current data and that IceCube-Gen2, with a higher
threshold but a larger exposure, could detect $\simeq 620$ dimuons ($\simeq 30$
from WBP) in 10 years. These dimuons are almost all produced by atmospheric
neutrinos. For the observational part, we perform a simple but conservative
analysis of IceCube public data, finding 19 candidate dimuon events. Subsequent
to our paper appearing, visual inspection of these events by the IceCube
Collaboration revealed that they are not real dimuons, but instead arise from
an internal reconstruction error that identifies some single muons crossing the
dust layer as two separate muons. To help IceCube and the broader community
with future dimuon searches, we include the updated full details of our
analysis. Together, these theoretical and observational contributions help open
a valuable new direction for neutrino telescopes, one especially important for
probing high-energy QCD and new physics.

(Ly$\alpha$) photons from giant molecular clouds (GMCs) is crucial if we are to
study the reionization of the Universe and to interpret spectra of observed
galaxies at high redshift. To this end, we perform high-resolution,
radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of GMCs with self-consistent star
formation and stellar feedback. We find that a significant fraction (15-70%) of
ionizing radiation escapes from the simulated GMCs with different masses
($10^5$ and $10^6\,M_\odot$), as the clouds are dispersed within about
$2$-$5\,{\rm Myr}$ from the onset of star formation. The fraction of LyC
photons leaked is larger when the GMCs are less massive, metal-poor, less
turbulent, and less dense. The most efficient leakage of LyC radiation occurs
when the total star formation efficiency of a GMC is about 20%. The escape of
Ly$\alpha$ shows a trend similar to that of LyC photons, except that the
fraction of Ly$\alpha$ photons escaping from the GMCs is larger ($f_{\rm
esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}\approx f_{900}^{0.27}$) and that a GMC with strong
turbulence shows larger $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}$. The simulated GMCs show a
characteristic velocity separation of $\Delta v\approx 120 \,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$
in the time-averaged emergent Ly$\alpha$ spectra, suggesting that Ly$\alpha$
could be useful to infer the kinematics of the interstellar and circumgalactic
medium. We show that Ly$\alpha$ luminosities are a useful indicator of the LyC
escape, provided the number of LyC photons can be deduced through stellar
population modeling. Finally, we find that the correlations between the escape
fractions of Ly$\alpha$, ultraviolet photons at 1500A, and the Balmer $\alpha$

behavior of generic quantum many-body systems. However, how this universal
many-body quantum chaotic regime emerges due to interactions remains largely a
puzzle. This paper demonstrates using both heuristic arguments and a
microscopic calculation that a dephasing mechanism, similar to
Altshuler-Aronov-Khmelnitskii dephasing in the theory of localization,
underlies this transition to chaos. We focus on the behavior of the spectral
form factor (SFF) as a function of ""time"", t, which characterizes level
correlations in the many-body spectrum. The SFF can be expressed as a sum over
periodic classical orbits and its behavior hinges on the interference of
trajectories related to each other by a time translation. In the absence of
interactions, time-translation symmetry is present for each individual
particle, which leads to a fast exponential growth of the SFF and
correspondingly loss of correlations between many-body levels. Interactions
lead to dephasing, which disrupts interference, and breaks the massive
time-translation symmetry down to a global time-translation/energy
conservation. This in turn gives rise to the hallmark linear-in-$t$ ramp in the
SFF reflecting Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. This general picture is supported
by a microscopic analysis of an interacting many-body model. Specifically, we
study the complex $\mbox{SYK}_2+\mbox{SYK}_2^2$ model, which allows to tune
between an integrable and chaotic regime. It is shown that the dephasing mass
vanishes in the former case, which maps to the non-interacting $\mbox{SYK}_2$
model via a time reparameterization. In contrast, the chaotic regime gives rise
to dephasing, which suppresses the exponential ramp of the non-interacting
theory and induces correlations between many-body levels.

approach oversimplifies the properties of the collision material by neglecting
features that can play important roles in the final structure and composition
of the system. In this study, we present a statistical analysis of the orbital

results of our analysis indicate that the masses of the fragments follow an
exponential distribution with an exponent of $-2.21\pm0.17$ over the range of
$10^{-7}$ to $2\times 10^{-2}$ Earth-masses. The distribution of the

to the delivery of material from the outer regions of the asteroid belt to the

the exchange of Glauber quarks. In Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) at
leading power, Glauber quark exchange is given by five non-local Glauber quark
operators, of which only one is generated at tree-level. We show that at
leading power the QCD amplitude for quark-gluon backscattering at one-loop can
be exactly reproduced by SCET using the tree-level Glauber operator. The
agreement between QCD and SCET of the ultraviolet, infrared, and rapidity

We find that the entire one-loop matching vanishes -- there is no correction to

this article, we compute entropic order parameters in weakly coupled gauge

expectation values of physical (smeared) non-local operators is prevented by
known difficulties in constructing suitable smeared Wilson loops. We circumvent
this problem by studying the smeared non-local class operators in the enlarged
non-gauge invariant Hilbert space. This provides a generic approach for smeared
operators in gauge theories and explicit formulas at weak coupling. In this
approach, the Wilson and 't Hooft loops are labeled by the full weight and
co-weight lattices respectively. We study generic Lie groups and discuss
couplings with matter fields. Smeared magnetic operators, as opposed to the
usual infinitely thin ones, have expectation values that approach one at weak
coupling. The corresponding entropic order parameter saturates to its maximum
topological value, except for an exponentially small correction, which we
compute. On the other hand, smeared 't Hooft loops and their entropic disorder
parameter are exponentially small. We verify that both behaviors match the

lower bounds (that differ by a factor of 2) for the exact coefficient of the

characterize the X-ray emission and search for evidence of circumbinary

as a ""notch"" in the continuum due to the presence of minidisks. We find that
the radio-optical emission agrees with the SED of a standard, radio-quiet, AGN,

success in learning from graph-structured data. With the growing tendency of
graph nodes and edges, GCN training by single processor cannot meet the demand
for time and memory, which led to a boom into distributed GCN training
frameworks research. However, existing distributed GCN training frameworks
require enormous communication costs between processors since multitudes of
dependent nodes and edges information need to be collected and transmitted for
GCN training from other processors. To address this issue, we propose a Graph
Augmentation based Distributed GCN framework(GAD). In particular, GAD has two
main components, GAD-Partition and GAD-Optimizer. We first propose a graph
augmentation-based partition (GAD-Partition) that can divide original graph
into augmented subgraphs to reduce communication by selecting and storing as
few significant nodes of other processors as possible while guaranteeing the
accuracy of the training. In addition, we further design a subgraph
variance-based importance calculation formula and propose a novel weighted
global consensus method, collectively referred to as GAD-Optimizer. This
optimizer adaptively reduces the importance of subgraphs with large variances
for the purpose of reducing the effect of extra variance introduced by
GAD-Partition on distributed GCN training. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly
reduces the communication overhead (50%), improves the convergence speed (2X)

For unitaries restricted to the smaller Clifford group, the set of commuting

larger. We use the recent full characterization of this commutant by Gross et
al., Comm. Math. Phys. 385, 1325 (2021), to construct the Clifford statistical
mechanics models for on-site Hilbert space dimensions which are powers of a
prime number $p$. We show that the Boltzmann weights are invariant under a
symmetry group involving orthogonal matrices with entries in the finite number
field ${\bf F}_p$. This implies that the symmetry group, and consequently all
universal properties of entanglement transitions in Clifford circuits and RTNs
will in general depend on, and only on the prime $p$. We show that Clifford
monitored circuits with on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p^M$ are described

holes provides an excellent place to study gravity in the strong, non-linear,
dynamical regime. Here, the effects of strong curvature can leave their imprint
on observables which we may use to study gravity. Recently, NICER provided a
mass and radius measurement of an isolated neutron star using x-rays, while
LIGO/Virgo measured the tidal deformability of neutron stars through
gravitational waves. These measurements can be used to test the relation
between the tidal deformability and compactness of neutron stars that are known
to be universal in general relativity. Here, we take (shift-symmetric)
scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (motivated by a low-energy effective theory of a
string theory) as an example and study whether one can apply the NICER and
LIGO/Virgo measurements to the universal relation to test the theory. To do so,
this paper is mostly devoted on theoretically constructing tidally-deformed
neutron star solutions in this theory perturbatively and calculate the tidal
deformability for the first time. We find that the relation between the tidal
deformability and compactness remains to be mostly universal for a fixed
dimensionless coupling constant of the theory though the relation is different
from the one in general relativity. We also present a universal relation
between the tidal deformability \textbf{of} one neutron star and the
compactness for another neutron star that can be directly applied to
observations by LIGO/Virgo and NICER. For the equations of state considered in
this paper, it is still inconclusive whether one can place a meaningful bounds
on scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity with the new universal relations. However, we
found a new bound from the mass measurement of the pulsar J0740+6620 that is

stabilization of the excited states for large enough self-interactions is
further supported by evidence that the nodeful states dynamically form through

our objective was to propose a multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN)
capable of distinguishing pathologies using receptive fields with various
sizes. The multi-scale CNN was designed based on the feature pyramid network
(FPN) structure and was used to diagnose normal and two common clinical
characteristics of dry and wet AMD, namely drusen and choroidal
neovascularization (CNV). The proposed method was evaluated on a national
dataset gathered at Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) and the UCSD public dataset.
Experimental results show the superior performance of our proposed multi-scale
structure over several well-known OCT classification frameworks. This feature
combination strategy has proved to be effective on all tested backbone models,
with improvements ranging from 0.4% to 3.3%. In addition, gradual learning has
proven to improve performance in two consecutive stages. In the first stage,

on the UCSD dataset. Lastly, generating heatmaps provided additional proof for
the effectiveness of our multi-scale structure, enabling the detection of

would facilitate label propagation to unlabeled data, whereas the latter would
ensure coverage of the entire dataset. We capture this idea by selecting
cluster prototypes, either in a pretrained feature space, or along with feature

Three candidate features for the latent space are compared: 1) Variance of

computed from pitch, energy, and duration, and 3) Learned combination of the
two aforementioned approaches. At inference time, word-level prosodic emphasis
is achieved by increasing the feature values of the latent space for the given

the overall stellar population of the post-starburst galaxy hosts. This implies
that SMBHs are preferentially disrupting higher mass stars, possibly due to
ongoing top-heavy star formation in nuclear star clusters or to dynamical
mechanisms that preferentially transport higher mass stars to their tidal

close to the uniform distribution. We generalize this classical inequality from
$d=1$ to higher dimensions $d>1$ with the class of Riesz potentials which
includes the logarithmic potential as a special case. In order to quantify how
close a probability measure is to the uniform distribution in a general space,
we use Wasserstein-infinity distance as a canonical extension of the concept of
discrepancy. Then we give a compact description of this distance. Then for
every dimension $d$, we prove inequalities bounding the Wasserstein-infinity
distance between a probability measure $\rho$ and the uniform distribution by
the $L^p$-norm of the Riesz potentials generated by $\rho$. Our inequalities
are proven to be sharp up to the constants for singular Riesz potentials. Our
results indicate that the phenomenon discovered by Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'an about

Transformer encoder encodes all domain-specific features as source domain
knowledge in memory. In the Transformer decoder, the domain-agnostic query
interacts with the memory in the cross-attention module, and domains that are
similar to the input will contribute more to the attention output. Thus, source
domain knowledge gets dynamically decoded for inference of the current input
from unseen domain. This mechanism enables the proposed method to generalize
well to unseen domains. The proposed method has been evaluated on three
benchmarks in the domain generalization field and shown to have the best
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

taken on renewed importance as a way to bridge the gap. However, evaluation of
the trade-offs incurred by popular compression techniques has been centered on
high-resource datasets. In this work, we instead consider the impact of
compression in a data-limited regime. We introduce the term low-resource double
bind to refer to the co-occurrence of data limitations and compute resource

the trade-offs in performance are poorly studied. Our work offers surprising
insights into the relationship between capacity and generalization in
data-limited regimes for the task of machine translation. Our experiments on
magnitude pruning for translations from English into Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo and
German show that in low-resource regimes, sparsity preserves performance on
frequent sentences but has a disparate impact on infrequent ones. However, it
improves robustness to out-of-distribution shifts, especially for datasets that
are very distinct from the training distribution. Our findings suggest that
sparsity can play a beneficial role at curbing memorization of low frequency
attributes, and therefore offers a promising solution to the low-resource
double bind.

active force and the swim velocity. A non-monotonic behavior of the mean escape
time is observed with the persistence time of the activity, revealing the
existence of an optimal choice of the parameters favoring the escape process.
For small persistence times, a Kramers-like formula with an effective potential
obtained within the Unified Colored Noise Approximation is shown to hold.
Instead, for large persistence times, we developed a simple theoretical
argument based on the first passage theory which explains the linear dependence
on the escape time with the persistence of the active force. In the second part
of the work, we consider the escape of two active particles mutually repelling.
Interestingly, the subtle interplay of active and repulsive forces may lead to
a correlation between particles favoring the simultaneous jump across the
barrier. This mechanism cannot be observed in the escape process of two passive
particles. Finally, we find that, in the small-persistence regime, the
repulsion favors the escape, like in passive systems, in agreement with our
theoretical predictions, while for large persistence times, the repulsive and

paired speech text data that is expensive to obtain. The amount of data
available varies across different languages and dialects. It is critical to
make use of all these data so that both low resource languages and high
resource languages can be improved. When we want to deploy an ASR system for a
new application domain, the amount of domain specific training data is very
limited. To be able to leverage data from existing domains is important for ASR
accuracy in the new domain. In this paper, we treat all these aspects as
categorical information in an ASR system, and propose a simple yet effective
way to integrate categorical features into E2E model. We perform detailed
analysis on various training strategies, and find that building a joint model
that includes categorical features can be more accurate than multiple
independently trained models.

thermocapillary convection in a two-fluid system with a deformable interface.
An explicit technique with 3rd order Runge-Kutta method in time, 2nd order ENO
for the advection terms, and 2nd order central-differencing for the diffusion
terms are employed in the momentum equations for simulating the flow on a
staggered grid using a Marker and Cell method. An energy equation is solved
numerically and a level-set method is used to implicitly capture the interface.
A constant contact angle condition is assumed between the end walls and the
interface. The domain is enclosed with adiabatic walls on the top and bottom
and a temperature gradient is imposed along the horizontal walls. A Continuum
Surface Force model is used for surface tension to numerically simulate the
thermo-capillary effect. A Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) technique is used
to solve the pressure equations iteratively. The level set method and the
energy equation are tested with a few test-cases before implementing in the
solver. The imposed temperature difference along the horizontal direction
produces a surface tension gradient along the liquid-liquid interface resulting
in the flow of the interface fluid from the region of lower surface tension
(Higher temperature) to higher surface tension (Lower temperature). The end
walls cause recirculation by imposing a horizontal pressure gradient in each
fluid layer.

as a unified framework for forward, inverse, and surrogate modeling of problems
governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Training PINNs for forward
problems, however, pose significant challenges, mainly because of the complex
non-convex and multi-objective loss function. In this work, we present a PINN
approach to solving the equations of coupled flow and deformation in porous
media for both single-phase and multiphase flow. To this end, we construct the
solution space using multi-layer neural networks. Due to the dynamics of the
problem, we find that incorporating multiple differential relations into the
loss function results in an unstable optimization problem, meaning that
sometimes it converges to the trivial null solution, other times it moves very
far from the expected solution. We report a dimensionless form of the coupled
governing equations that we find most favourable to the optimizer.
Additionally, we propose a sequential training approach based on the
stress-split algorithms of poromechanics. Notably, we find that sequential
training based on stress-split performs well for different problems, while the
classical strain-split algorithm shows an unstable behaviour similar to what is
reported in the context of finite element solvers. We use the approach to solve
benchmark problems of poroelasticity, including Mandel's consolidation problem,
Barry-Mercer's injection-production problem, and a reference two-phase drainage
problem. The Python-SciANN codes reproducing the results reported in this

adding Gaussian noise to the gradients calculated during training as a part of

a recommender system and a user. Instead of assuming the user is omniscient,
static, and explicit, as the classical practice does, we sketch a more
realistic user behavior model, under which the user: 1) rejects recommendations
if they are clearly worse than others; 2) updates her utility estimation based
on rewards from her accepted recommendations; 3) withholds realized rewards
from the system. We formulate the interactions between the system and such an
explorative user in a $K$-armed bandit framework and study the problem of
learning the optimal recommendation on the system side. We show that efficient
system learning is still possible but is more difficult. In particular, the
system can identify the best arm with probability at least $1-\delta$ within
$O(1/\delta)$ interactions, and we prove this is tight. Our finding contrasts
the result for the problem of best arm identification with fixed confidence, in
which the best arm can be identified with probability $1-\delta$ within
$O(\log(1/\delta))$ interactions. This gap illustrates the inevitable cost the
system has to pay when it learns from an explorative user's revealed
preferences on its recommendations rather than from the realized rewards.

of the same quantum modes on a (semiclassical) dressed geometry. When the
backreaction of the field is discarded, the classical spacetime singularity is
resolved due to quantum gravity effects and is replaced by a quantum bounce on
the dressed collapse background. In the presence of backreaction, the emergent
(interior) dressed geometry becomes mode dependent and the energy density
associated with the backreaction of each mode scales as a radiation fluid.
Semiclassical dynamics of this so-called {\em rainbow} dressed background is
analyzed. It turns out that the backreaction effects speed up the occurrence of
the bounce in comparison to the case where only a dust fluid is present. By
matching the interior and exterior regions at the boundary of dust, a
mode-dependent black hole geometry emerges as the exterior spacetime.
Properties of such a rainbow black hole are discussed. That mode dependence
causes, in particular, a chromatic aberration in the gravitational lensing

our estimation algorithm and assumptions apply to instrumental variables linear

variational problems, wherein $\int_\Omega f(x,u(x),\nabla u(x)){\rm d}x$ is
minimized over functions $u\colon\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$
satisfying given equality or inequality constraints. Each constraint may be
imposed over $\Omega$ or its boundary, either pointwise or in an integral
sense. These global minimizations are generally non-convex and intractable. We
formulate a particular convex maximization, here called the pointwise dual
relaxation (PDR), whose supremum is a lower bound on the infimum of the
original problem. The PDR can be derived by dualizing and relaxing the original
problem; its constraints are pointwise equalities or inequalities over
finite-dimensional sets, rather than over infinite-dimensional function spaces.
When the original minimization can be specified by polynomial functions of
$(x,u,\nabla u)$, the PDR can be further relaxed by replacing pointwise
inequalities with polynomial sum-of-squares (SOS) conditions. The resulting SOS
program is computationally tractable when the dimensions $m,n$ and number of
constraints are not too large. The framework presented here generalizes an
approach of Valmorbida, Ahmadi, and Papachristodoulou (IEEE Trans. Automat.
Contr., 61:1649--1654, 2016). We prove that the optimal lower bound given by
the PDR is sharp for several classes of problems, whose special cases include
leading eigenvalues of Sturm-Liouville problems and optimal constants of
Poincar\'e inequalities. For these same classes, we prove that SOS relaxations
of the PDR converge to the sharp lower bound as polynomial degrees are
increased. Convergence of SOS computations in practice is illustrated for
several examples.

However, this collected data may contain sensitive information (e.g., personal

might cause significant privacy concerns. To counter such concerns, service
providers like Google present their users with a personal data dashboard
(called `My Activity Dashboard'), allowing them to manage all voice assistant
collected data. However, a real-world GVA-data driven understanding of user
perceptions and preferences regarding this data (and data dashboards) remained
relatively unexplored in prior research.
  To that end, in this work we focused on Google Voice Assistant (GVA) users
and investigated the perceptions and preferences of GVA users regarding data
and dashboard while grounding them in real GVA-collected user data.
Specifically, we conducted an 80-participant survey-based user study to collect
both generic perceptions regarding GVA usage as well as desired privacy
preferences for a stratified sample of their GVA data. We show that most
participants had superficial knowledge about the type of data collected by GVA.
Worryingly, we found that participants felt uncomfortable sharing a non-trivial

dashboard, although useful, did not help long-time GVA users effectively manage
their data privacy. Our real-data-driven study found that showing users even

dashboards. To that end, we built a classifier that can detect sensitive data

generates corresponding output (control commands). With recent advances in
technology, AI-based policies have gained attention as control models for HMIs.
However, supervised learning techniques require affluent amounts of labeled
training data from the user, which is challenging in the context of lower-limb
rehabilitation. Moreover, a static pre-trained model does not take the temporal
variations in the motion of the amputee (e.g., due to speed, terrain) into
account. In this study, we aimed to address both of these issues by creating an
incremental training approach for a torque prediction model using incomplete
user-specific training data and biologically inspired temporal patterns of
human gait. To reach this goal, we created a hybrid of two distinct approaches,
a generic inter-individual and an adapting individual-specific model that
exploits the inter-limb synergistic coupling during human gait to learn a
function that predicts the torque at the ankle joint continuously based on the
kinematic sequences of the hip, knee, and shank. An inter-individual generic
base model learns temporal patterns of gait from a set of able-bodied
individuals and predicts the gait patterns for a new individual, while the
individual-specific adaptation model learns and predicts the temporal patterns
of gait specific to a particular individual. The iterative training using the
hybrid model was validated on eight able-bodied and five transtibial amputee
subjects. It was found that, with the addition of estimators fitted to
individual-specific data, the accuracy significantly increased from the
baseline inter-individual model and plateaued within two to three iterations.

generally find that the large scale magnetic field becomes weaker as the flow

(2) magnetic diffusion is important on the small convective length scale. These
findings are in agreement with previous asymptotic predictions and suggest that

of partial correlations between Alice's/Bob's and Eve's probing noises is
explored, that is, Eve's knowledge of Alice's and Bob's noises is limited but
not zero. We explore the bilateral situation where Eve has partial knowledge of
Alice's and Bob's random number generators. It is shown that in this situation
Eve can crack the secure key bit by taking the highest cross-correlation
between her probing noises and the measured voltage noise in the wire. She can
also crack the secure key bit by taking the highest cross-correlation between
her noise voltages and her evaluation of Alice's/Bob's noise voltages. We then
explore the unilateral situation in which Eve has partial knowledge of only
Alice's random number generator thus only those noises (of Alice and Eve) are
correlated. In this situation Eve can still crack the secure key bit, but for
sufficiently low error probability, she needs to use the whole bit exchange
period for the attack. The security of the KLJN key exchange scheme, similarly
to other protocols, necessitates that the random number generator outputs are
truly random for Eve.

vision-based ice hockey analytics. The data generated by tracking is used in
many other downstream tasks, such as game event detection and game strategy
analysis. Player tracking and identification is a challenging problem since the
motion of players in hockey is fast-paced and non-linear when compared to
pedestrians. There is also significant camera panning and zooming in hockey
broadcast video. Identifying players in ice hockey is challenging since the
players of the same team look almost identical, with the jersey number the only
discriminating factor between players. In this paper, an automated system to
track and identify players in broadcast NHL hockey videos is introduced. The
system is composed of three components (1) Player tracking, (2) Team
identification and (3) Player identification. Due to the absence of publicly
available datasets, the datasets used to train the three components are
annotated manually. Player tracking is performed with the help of a state of
the art tracking algorithm obtaining a Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA)
score of 94.5%. For team identification, the away-team jerseys are grouped into
a single class and home-team jerseys are grouped in classes according to their
jersey color. A convolutional neural network is then trained on the team
identification dataset. The team identification network gets an accuracy of 97%
on the test set. A novel player identification model is introduced that
utilizes a temporal one-dimensional convolutional network to identify players
from player bounding box sequences. The player identification model further
takes advantage of the available NHL game roster data to obtain a player
identification accuracy of 83%.

  What if we had a way to harness the power of large image datasets but with
few or none of the major issues and concerns currently faced? This paper
extends the recent work of Kataoka et. al. (2020), proposing an improved
pre-training dataset based on dynamically-generated fractal images. Challenging
issues with large-scale image datasets become points of elegance for fractal
pre-training: perfect label accuracy at zero cost; no need to store/transmit
large image archives; no privacy/demographic bias/concerns of inappropriate

and the images are free/open-source. Perhaps surprisingly, avoiding these
difficulties imposes only a small penalty in performance. Leveraging a
newly-proposed pre-training task -- multi-instance prediction -- our

In this work, we consider three classes of anomaly inputs, (1) natural inputs

Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples, (2) crafted inputs generated from ID by

deepen our understanding of shortcut learning and its implications. We design a
training setup with several shortcut cues, named WCST-ML, where each cue is
equally conducive to the visual recognition problem at hand. Even under equal

solutions biased to the easy-to-learn cues tend to converge to relatively flat

high-dimensional physical and empirical parameters. These parameters need to be
accurately calibrated for models to produce reliable predictions for
streamflow, evapotranspiration, snow water equivalent, and nutrient loading.
Existing parameter estimation methods are time-consuming, inefficient, and
computationally intensive, with reduced accuracy when estimating
high-dimensional parameters. In this paper, we present a fast, accurate, and
reliable methodology to calibrate the SWAT model (i.e., 21 parameters) using
deep learning (DL). We develop DL-enabled inverse models based on convolutional
neural networks to ingest streamflow data and estimate the SWAT model
parameters. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to identify the optimal neural
network architecture and the nine next best candidates. We use ensemble SWAT
simulations to train, validate, and test the above DL models. We estimated the
actual parameters of the SWAT model using observational data. We test and
validate the proposed DL methodology on the American River Watershed, located
in the Pacific Northwest-based Yakima River basin. Our results show that the DL
models-based calibration is better than traditional parameter estimation
methods, such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE). The
behavioral parameter sets estimated by DL have narrower ranges than GLUE and
produce values within the sampling range even under high relative observational
errors. This narrow range of parameters shows the reliability of the proposed
workflow to estimate sensitive parameters accurately even under noise. Due to
its fast and reasonably accurate estimations of process parameters, the
proposed DL workflow is attractive for calibrating integrated hydrologic models
for large spatial-scale applications.

that for linear dichroism, the basic assumption that the absorption through a
ray path is the integral of the absorption coefficient, defined on the volume
of the sample, along the ray path, is not correct when dichroism or
birefringence is strong. This assumption is fundamental to tomographic methods.

explaining the predictions of machine learning models in key areas such as
finance and medical diagnosis. Counterfactuals are often discussed under the
assumption that the model on which they will be used is static, but in
deployment models may be periodically retrained or fine-tuned. This paper
studies the consistency of model prediction on counterfactual examples in deep
networks under small changes to initial training conditions, such as weight
initialization and leave-one-out variations in data, as often occurs during
model deployment. We demonstrate experimentally that counterfactual examples
for deep models are often inconsistent across such small changes, and that
increasing the cost of the counterfactual, a stability-enhancing mitigation
suggested by prior work in the context of simpler models, is not a reliable
heuristic in deep networks. Rather, our analysis shows that a model's local
Lipschitz continuity around the counterfactual is key to its consistency across
related models. To this end, we propose Stable Neighbor Search as a way to
generate more consistent counterfactual explanations, and illustrate the
effectiveness of this approach on several benchmark datasets.

Our model gives insight into the mechanism of motion, and allows us to ask:
when does a nanocaterpillar prefer to move by sliding, where one leg is always
linked to the surface, and when does it prefer to move by hopping, which
requires all legs to unbind simultaneously? We compare a range of systems

effects of time-varying treatments on time-to-event outcomes. Several methods
have been developed for controlling for the time-dependent confounding that
typically occurs. The most commonly used is inverse probability weighted
estimation of marginal structural models (MSM-IPTW). An alternative, the
sequential trials approach, is increasingly popular, in particular in
combination with the target trial emulation framework. This approach involves
creating a sequence of `trials' from new time origins, restricting to
individuals as yet untreated and meeting other eligibility criteria, and
comparing treatment initiators and non-initiators. Individuals are censored
when they deviate from their treatment status at the start of each `trial'
(initiator/non-initiator) and this is addressed using inverse probability of
censoring weights. The analysis is based on data combined across trials. We
show that the sequential trials approach can estimate the parameter of a
particular MSM, and compare it to a MSM-IPTW with respect to the estimands
being identified, the assumptions needed and how data are used differently. We
show how both approaches can estimate the same marginal risk differences. The
two approaches are compared using a simulation study. The sequential trials
approach, which tends to involve less extreme weights than MSM-IPTW, results in
greater efficiency for estimating the marginal risk difference at most
follow-up times, but this can, in certain scenarios, be reversed at late time
points. We apply the methods to longitudinal observational data from the UK
Cystic Fibrosis Registry to estimate the effect of dornase alfa on survival.

problem. The $U(1)'$ symmetry is identified as the quantum number of the
difference between the Standard Model fermion number and hyperbaryon number,
written as $SM-HB$. This type of $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry is naturally broken in
some fundamental composite Higgs models, which leads to a TeV-scale $Z'$ boson.
We present a concrete example based on the minimal fundamental composite Higgs
model with $SU(4)/Sp(4)$ coset, where the $Z'$ boson is the only state below
the compositeness scale beside the composite Higgs. We also show that if the
$U(1)'$ symmetry is third-generation-philic, written as $SM_3-HB$, the
corresponding $Z'$ boson can explain the neutral current B anomalies. The model
introduces the composite Higgs and the $Z'$ boson from the same symmetry
breaking scale, so Higgs physics and flavor physics are now connected. After
considering all the experimental constraints and theoretical preferences, we
found that there is still a natural parameter space for $SU(4)/Sp(4)$
fundamental composite Higgs model with $N_{HC}=2$, which can be probed in the
near future.

  statistical mechanics of dark matter flow","Reformatted with data source provided",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The halo-mediated inverse cascade is a key feature of the intermediate
statistically steady state for self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow
(SG-CFD). How the inverse mass and energy cascade maximize system entropy and
develop limiting velocity/energy distributions are fundamental questions to
answer. We present a statistical theory concerning the maximum entropy
distributions of velocity, speed, and energy for system involving a power-law
interaction with an arbitrary exponent $n$. For $-2<n<0$ (long-range
interaction with $n=-1$ for gravity), a broad spectrum of halos and halo groups
are necessary to form from inverse mass cascade to maximize system entropy.
While velocity in each halo group is still Gaussian, velocity distribution in
entire system can be non-Gaussian. With virial equilibrium for mechanical
equilibrium in halo groups, the maximum entropy principle is applied for
statistical equilibrium of global system to derive the limiting velocity
distribution (the \textit{X} distribution). Halo mass function is not required
in this formulation, but a direct result of maximizing entropy. The predicted
velocity (\textit{X}) distribution involves a shape parameter $\alpha$ that is
dependent on the exponent $n$. Velocity distribution approaches Laplacian with
$\alpha\rightarrow0$ and Gaussian with $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$. For
intermediate $\alpha$, distribution naturally exhibits a Gaussian core at small
velocity and exponential wings at large velocity. The total energy $\epsilon$
of dark matter particles at a given speed $v$ follows a parabolic scaling for
small speed ($\epsilon \propto v^2$) and linear scaling ($\epsilon \propto v$)
for large speed, which might be relevant to understand the deep-MOND behavior
in MOND theory. Results are compared with N-body simulations with good
agreement.

quantifying the dissimilarity between two given metric spaces. It is known that
computing $d_\mathrm{GH}$ between two finite metric spaces is NP-hard, even in
the case of finite ultrametric spaces which are highly structured metric spaces
in the sense that they satisfy the so-called \emph{strong triangle inequality}.
Ultrametric spaces naturally arise in many applications such as hierarchical
clustering, phylogenetics, genomics, and even linguistics. By exploiting the
special structures of ultrametric spaces, (1) we identify a one parameter
family $\{d_\mathrm{GH}^{(p)}\}_{p\in[1,\infty]}$ of distances defined in a
flavor similar to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance on the collection of finite
ultrametric spaces, and in particular $d_\mathrm{GH}^{(1)} =d_\mathrm{GH}$. The
extreme case when $p=\infty$, which we also denote by $u_\mathrm{GH}$, turns
out to be an ultrametric on the collection of ultrametric spaces. Whereas for
all $p\in[1,\infty)$, $d_\mathrm{GH}^{(p)}$ yields NP-hard problems, we prove
that surprisingly $u_\mathrm{GH}$ can be computed in polynomial time. The proof
is based on a structural theorem for $u_\mathrm{GH}$ established in this paper;
(2) inspired by the structural theorem for $u_\mathrm{GH}$, and by carefully
leveraging properties of ultrametric spaces, we also establish a structural
theorem for $d_\mathrm{GH}$ when restricted to ultrametric spaces. This
structural theorem allows us to identify special families of ultrametric spaces
on which $d_\mathrm{GH}$ is computationally tractable. These families are
determined by properties related to the doubling constant of metric space.
Based on these families, we devise a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm
for computing the exact value of $d_\mathrm{GH}$ between ultrametric spaces. We
believe ours is the first such algorithm to be identified.

Recently, the relation between the sharpness of the loss landscape and the

Sharpness Aware Minimizer (SAM) was proposed to mitigate the degradation of the
generalization. Unfortunately, SAM s computational cost is roughly double that
of base optimizers, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This paper thus
proposes Efficient Sharpness Aware Minimizer (ESAM), which boosts SAM s
efficiency at no cost to its generalization performance. ESAM includes two
novel and efficient training strategies-StochasticWeight Perturbation and
Sharpness-Sensitive Data Selection. In the former, the sharpness measure is
approximated by perturbing a stochastically chosen set of weights in each
iteration; in the latter, the SAM loss is optimized using only a judiciously
selected subset of data that is sensitive to the sharpness. We provide
theoretical explanations as to why these strategies perform well. We also show,
via extensive experiments on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, that ESAM
enhances the efficiency over SAM from requiring 100% extra computations to 40%
vis-a-vis base optimizers, while test accuracies are preserved or even

(IR) cameras are robust under such conditions and can be helpful in real-world
applications. Though thermal cameras are widely used for military applications
and increasingly for commercial applications, there is a lack of robust
algorithms to robustly exploit the thermal imagery due to the limited
availability of labeled thermal data. In this work, we aim to enhance the
object detection performance in the thermal domain by leveraging the labeled
visible domain data in an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) setting. We
propose an algorithm agnostic meta-learning framework to improve existing UDA
methods instead of proposing a new UDA strategy. We achieve this by
meta-learning the initial condition of the detector, which facilitates the
adaptation process with fine updates without overfitting or getting stuck at
local optima. However, meta-learning the initial condition for the detection
scenario is computationally heavy due to long and intractable computation
graphs. Therefore, we propose an online meta-learning paradigm which performs
online updates resulting in a short and tractable computation graph. To this
end, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over many baselines in the
UDA setting, producing a state-of-the-art thermal detector for the KAIST and
DSIAC datasets.

challenge for many application areas. Long-term hydrothermal dispatch planning
(LHDP) materializes this challenge in a real-world problem that affects
electricity markets, economies, and natural resources worldwide. No closed-form
solutions are available for MSLP and the definition of non-anticipative
policies with high-quality out-of-sample performance is crucial. Linear
decision rules (LDR) provide an interesting simulation-based framework for
finding high-quality policies for MSLP through two-stage stochastic models. In
practical applications, however, the number of parameters to be estimated when
using an LDR may be close to or higher than the number of scenarios of the
sample average approximation problem, thereby generating an in-sample overfit
and poor performances in out-of-sample simulations. In this paper, we propose a
novel regularized LDR to solve MSLP based on the AdaLASSO (adaptive least
absolute shrinkage and selection operator). The goal is to use the parsimony
principle, as largely studied in high-dimensional linear regression models, to
obtain better out-of-sample performance for LDR applied to MSLP. Computational
experiments show that the overfit threat is non-negligible when using classical
non-regularized LDR to solve the LHDP, one of the most studied MSLP with
relevant applications. Our analysis highlights the following benefits of the
proposed framework in comparison to the non-regularized benchmark: 1)
significant reductions in the number of non-zero coefficients (model
parsimony), 2) substantial cost reductions in out-of-sample evaluations, and 3)
improved spot-price profiles.

proposed for speaker counting, multi-talker speech recognition, and speaker

the E2E SA-ASR model originally does not estimate any time-related information,
we show that the start and end times of each word can be estimated with
sufficient accuracy from the internal state of the E2E SA-ASR by adding a small
number of learnable parameters. Similar to the target-speaker voice activity
detection (TS-VAD)-based diarization method, the E2E SA-ASR model is applied to
estimate speech activity of each speaker while it has the advantages of (i)
handling unlimited number of speakers, (ii) leveraging linguistic information
for speaker diarization, and (iii) simultaneously generating speaker-attributed
transcriptions. Experimental results on the LibriCSS and AMI corpora show that
the proposed method achieves significantly better diarization error rate than
various existing speaker diarization methods when the number of speakers is
unknown, and achieves a comparable performance to TS-VAD when the number of
speakers is given in advance. The proposed method simultaneously generates
speaker-attributed transcription with state-of-the-art accuracy.

source associated with the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) at the periphery of
the cluster. The bent morphology of the WAT indicates that its jets have been
swept back by the dynamic pressure resulting from the motion of the BCG through
the surrounding intracluster medium. The BCG associated with the WAT hosts a
black hole whose mass we estimate to be 1.4$\pm0.4 \times10^{9} \Msun$. We
observe a 2\arcmin (195\,kpc in projection) offset between the BCG and the
X-ray centroid of the galaxy cluster, which, along with other dynamic features,
indicates the cluster's early stage of evolution. The WAT radio galaxy, the arc
and the filaments have spectral indices $\alpha_{612}^{240}= -0.46\pm 0.15$,
$-0.8\pm0.3$, and ($-1.13\pm 0.48$, $-1.40\pm 0.50$), respectively. The WAT and
the arc are connected structures, while the filaments are detached from them,

autonomous systems (drones and vehicles) for safety purpose. It normally relies
on a stereo camera to automatically detect obstacles and make flying/driving
decisions, e.g., stopping several meters ahead of the obstacle in the path or
moving away from the detected obstacle. In this paper, we explore new security
risks associated with the stereo vision-based depth estimation algorithms used
for obstacle avoidance. By exploiting the weaknesses of the stereo matching in
depth estimation algorithms and the lens flare effect in optical imaging, we
propose DoubleStar, a long-range attack that injects fake obstacle depth by
projecting pure light from two complementary light sources.
  DoubleStar includes two distinctive attack formats: beams attack and orbs
attack, which leverage projected light beams and lens flare orbs respectively
to cause false depth perception. We successfully attack two commercial stereo
cameras designed for autonomous systems (ZED and Intel RealSense). The
visualization of fake depth perceived by the stereo cameras illustrates the
false stereo matching induced by DoubleStar. We further use Ardupilot to
simulate the attack and demonstrate its impact on drones. To validate the
attack on real systems, we perform a real-world attack towards a commercial
drone equipped with state-of-the-art obstacle avoidance algorithms. Our attack
can continuously bring a flying drone to a sudden stop or drift it away across
a long distance under various lighting conditions, even bypassing sensor fusion
mechanisms. Specifically, our experimental results show that DoubleStar creates
fake depth up to 15 meters in distance at night and up to 8 meters during the
daytime. To mitigate this newly discovered threat, we provide discussions on

algorithms that estimate the whole distribution of the total return rather than
only its expectation. Despite the remarkable performance of distributional RL,
a theoretical understanding of its advantages over expectation-based RL remains
elusive. In this paper, we attribute the superiority of distributional RL to
its regularization effect in terms of the value distribution information
regardless of its expectation. Firstly, by leverage of a variant of the gross
error model in robust statistics, we decompose the value distribution into its
expectation and the remaining distribution part. As such, the extra benefit of
distributional RL compared with expectation-based RL is mainly interpreted as
the impact of a \textit{risk-sensitive entropy regularization} within the
Neural Fitted Z-Iteration framework. Meanwhile, we establish a bridge between
the risk-sensitive entropy regularization of distributional RL and the vanilla
entropy in maximum entropy RL, focusing specifically on actor-critic
algorithms. It reveals that distributional RL induces a corrected reward
function and thus promotes a risk-sensitive exploration against the intrinsic
uncertainty of the environment. Finally, extensive experiments corroborate the
role of the regularization effect of distributional RL and uncover mutual
impacts of different entropy regularization. Our research paves a way towards
better interpreting the efficacy of distributional RL algorithms, especially

paper, we propose a capacity-centric (C$^2$) architecture for future wireless

the number of non-overlapping clusters with the average cluster capacity
guaranteed to be higher than a certain threshold, and thus provides a flexible

curvature, is elliptic and leads to well-defined perturbation theory of gravity
about any classical solution. The conformal boundary condition was previously
considered in [2, 3] in the context of AdS/BCFT, wherein the equation of motion
of the end-of-the-world was derived and emphasized. In this paper, we
investigate further other consequences of the conformal boundary condition in
AdS/BCFT. We derive the boundary central charges of the holographic Weyl
anomaly and show that they are exactly the same for conformal boundary
condition and Dirichlet boundary condition. We analysis the metric perturbation
with conformal boundary condition (CBC), Dirichlet boundary condition (DBC) and
Neumann boundary condition (NBC) imposed on the end-of-the-world brane and show
that they admit an interpretation as the fluctuation of the extrinsic curvature
(case of CBC and DBC) and the induced metric (case of NBC) of Q respectively.
In all cases, the fluctuation modes are massive, which are closely relevant to
the massive island formation in the literature. Our results reveal that there
are non-trivial gravitational dynamics from extrinsic curvatures on the
conformal and Dirichlet branes, which may have interesting applications to the
island. We also discuss, in passing, the localization of gravitons in brane
world theory. We find that, contrary to NBC, the graviton for CBC/DBC is
located on the brane with non-positive tension instead of non-negative tension.

(HEA), but with limited quantitative success. Herein, we demonstrate a new
strategy for designing metastable HEAs and validate its effectiveness by
discovering seven new alloys with experimentally observed metastability for

traditional ISFE criterion fails in more than half of the cases, while the

hypothesized to represent a memory, concept, word, and other cognitive
categories. Assemblies are believed to provide a bridge between high-level
cognitive phenomena and low-level neural activity. Recently, a computational
system called the Assembly Calculus (AC), with a repertoire of biologically
plausible operations on assemblies, has been shown capable of simulating
arbitrary space-bounded computation, but also of simulating complex cognitive
phenomena such as language, reasoning, and planning. However, the mechanism
whereby assemblies can mediate learning has not been known. Here we present
such a mechanism, and prove rigorously that, for simple classification problems
defined on distributions of labeled assemblies, a new assembly representing
each class can be reliably formed in response to a few stimuli from the class;
this assembly is henceforth reliably recalled in response to new stimuli from
the same class. Furthermore, such class assemblies will be distinguishable as
long as the respective classes are reasonably separated -- for example, when
they are clusters of similar assemblies. To prove these results, we draw on
random graph theory with dynamic edge weights to estimate sequences of
activated vertices, yielding strong generalizations of previous calculations
and theorems in this field over the past five years. These theorems are backed
up by experiments demonstrating the successful formation of assemblies which
represent concept classes on synthetic data drawn from such distributions, and
also on MNIST, which lends itself to classification through one assembly per
digit. Seen as a learning algorithm, this mechanism is entirely online,
generalizes from very few samples, and requires only mild supervision -- all
key attributes of learning in a model of the brain.

adopted ridge regression to estimate the reward function and combine it with TS
or UCB strategies for exploration. However, this line of works explicitly
assumes the reward is based on a linear function of arm vectors, which may not
be true in real-world datasets. To overcome this challenge, a series of neural
bandit algorithms have been proposed, where a neural network is used to learn
the underlying reward function and TS or UCB are adapted for exploration.
Instead of calculating a large-deviation based statistical bound for
exploration like previous methods, we propose ""EE-Net"", a novel neural-based
exploration strategy. In addition to using a neural network (Exploitation
network) to learn the reward function, EE-Net uses another neural network
(Exploration network) to adaptively learn potential gains compared to the
currently estimated reward for exploration. Then, a decision-maker is
constructed to combine the outputs from the Exploitation and Exploration
networks. We prove that EE-Net can achieve $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T\log T})$ regret
and show that EE-Net outperforms existing linear and neural contextual bandit
baselines on real-world datasets.

cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum analyses. While this approach
easily captures correlations in the data, noise in the resulting covariance
estimate can systematically bias the parameter fitting. Conditioning the
estimated covariance matrix, by applying prior information on the shape of the
eigenvectors, can reduce these biases and ensure the recovery of robust
parameter constraints. In this work, we use simulations to benchmark the
performance of four different conditioning schemes, motivated by contemporary
CMB analyses. The simulated surveys measure the $TT$, $TE$, and $EE$ power
spectra over the angular multipole range $300 \le \ell \le 3500$ in $\Delta
\ell = 50$ wide bins, for temperature map-noise levels of $10, 6.4$ and
$2\,\mu$K-arcmin. We divide the survey data into $N_{\mathrm{real}} = 30, 50,$
or 100 uniform subsets. We show the results of different conditioning schemes
on the errors in the covariance estimate, and how these uncertainties on the
covariance matrix propagate to the best-fit parameters and parameter
uncertainties. The most significant effect we find is an additional scatter in
the best-fit point, beyond what is expected from the data likelihood. For a
minimal conditioning strategy, $N_{\mathrm{real}} = 30$, and a temperature
map-noise level of 10$\,\mu$K-arcmin, we find the uncertainty on the recovered
best fit parameter to be $\times 1.3$ larger than the apparent posterior width
from the likelihood ($\times 1.2$ larger than the uncertainty when the true
covariance is used). Stronger priors on the covariance matrix reduce the
misestimation of parameter uncertainties to $<1\%$. As expected, empirical
estimates perform better with higher $N_{\mathrm{real}}$, ameliorating the
adverse effects on parameter constraints.

Field Camera (WFC). The main aims of this survey are to identify the most
evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants at the
end-point of their evolution based on their pulsational instability, use their
distribution over luminosity to reconstruct the star formation history (SFH),
quantify the dust production and mass loss from modelling the multi-wavelength
spectral energy distributions, and relate this to luminosity and radius
variations. In this second of a series of papers, we present the methodology
used to estimate SFH based on long-period variable (LPV) stars and then derive
it for Andromeda\,I (And\,I) dwarf galaxy as an example of the survey. Using
our identified 59 LPV candidates within two half-light radii of And\,I and
Padova stellar evolution models, we estimated the SFH of this galaxy. A major
epoch of star formation occurred in And\,I peaking around 6.6 Gyr ago, reaching
$0.0035\pm0.0016$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and only slowly declining until 1--2 Gyr
ago. The presence of some dusty LPVs in this galaxy corresponds to a slight
increase in recent star formation peaking around 800 Myr ago. We evaluate a
quenching time around 4 Gyr ago ($z<0.5$), which makes And\,I a late-quenching
dSph. A total stellar mass $(16\pm7)\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ is calculated within
two half-light radii of And\,I for a constant metallicity $Z=0.0007$.

the energy spectrum of a system with a generic random Hamiltonian matrix
affects its early and late time thermalization behaviour using the spectral
form factor (which captures the time-dependence of two-point correlation
functions). We introduce a simple statistical framework for generating random
spectra in terms of the nearest neighbor spacing statistics of energy
eigenvalues, enabling us to compute the averaged spectral form factor in a
closed form. This helps to easily illustrate how the spectral form factor
changes with different choices of nearest neighbor statistics ranging from the
Poisson to Wigner surmise statistics. We suggest that it is possible to have
late time oscillations in random matrix models involving $\beta$-ensembles
(generalizing classical Gaussian ensembles). We also study the form factor of
randomly coupled oscillator systems and show that at weak coupling, such
systems exhibit regular decaying oscillations in the spectral form factor
making them interesting toy models for gravitational wave echoes. We speculate
on the holographic interpretation of a system of coupled oscillators, and
suggest that they describe the thermalization behaviour of a black hole
geometry with a membrane that cuts off the geometry at the stretched horizon.

from its samples observed under a $b$-bit communication constraint. In contrast
to most previous results that largely focus on the global minimax error, we
study the local behavior of the estimation error and provide \emph{pointwise}
bounds that depend on the target distribution $p$. In particular, we show that
the $\ell_2$ error decays with $O\left(\frac{\lVert p\rVert_{1/2}}{n2^b}\vee
\frac{1}{n}\right)$ (In this paper, we use $a\vee b$ and $a \wedge b$ to denote
$\max(a, b)$ and $\min(a,b)$ respectively.) when $n$ is sufficiently large,
hence it is governed by the \emph{half-norm} of $p$ instead of the ambient
dimension $d$. For the achievability result, we propose a two-round
sequentially interactive estimation scheme that achieves this error rate
uniformly over all $p$. Our scheme is based on a novel local refinement idea,
where we first use a standard global minimax scheme to localize $p$ and then
use the remaining samples to locally refine our estimate. We also develop a new
local minimax lower bound with (almost) matching $\ell_2$ error, showing that
any interactive scheme must admit a $\Omega\left( \frac{\lVert p
\rVert_{{(1+\delta)}/{2}}}{n2^b}\right)$ $\ell_2$ error for any $\delta > 0$.
The lower bound is derived by first finding the best parametric sub-model
containing $p$, and then upper bounding the quantized Fisher information under
this model.
  Our upper and lower bounds together indicate that the $\mathcal{H}_{1/2}(p) =
\log(\lVert p \rVert_{{1}/{2}})$ bits of communication is both sufficient and
necessary to achieve the optimal (centralized) performance, where
$\mathcal{H}_{{1}/{2}}(p)$ is the R\'enyi entropy of order $2$. Therefore,
under the $\ell_2$ loss, the correct measure of the local communication
complexity at $p$ is its R\'enyi entropy.

observational, instrumental, and analysis effects. In order to further
understand and mitigate these effects, it is instructive to explore different
aspects of existing datasets. One such aspect is the choice of observing field.
To date, MWA EoR observations have largely focused on the EoR0 field. In this
work, we present a new detailed analysis of the EoR1 field. The EoR1 field is
one of the coldest regions of the Southern radio sky, but contains the very
bright radio galaxy Fornax-A. The presence of this bright extended source in
the primary beam of the interferometer makes the calibration and analysis of
EoR1 particularly challenging. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a recently

for the study of nuclear organization, gene expression, and cell

complexity and variability of microscopy images and often over-segment or
under-segment the cell nuclei. Thus, there is a need to improve segmentation
accuracy and reliability, as well as the level of automation. In this paper, we
propose a new automated algorithm for robust segmentation of 3-D cell nuclei
using the concepts of random walk, graph theory, and mathematical morphology as
the foundation. Like other segmentation algorithms, we first use a seed
detection/marker extraction algorithm to find a seed voxel for each individual
cell nucleus. Next, using the concept of random walk on a graph we find the
probability of all the pixels in the 3-D image to reach the seed pixels of each
nucleus identified by the seed detection algorithm. We then generate a 3-D
response image by combining these probabilities for each voxel and use the
marker controlled watershed transform on this response image to obtain an
initial segmentation of the cell nuclei. Finally, we apply local region-based
active contours to obtain final segmentation of the cell nuclei. The advantage
of using such an approach is that it is capable of accurately segmenting highly
textured cells having inhomogeneous intensities and varying shapes and sizes.
The proposed algorithm was compared with three other automated nucleus
segmentation algorithms for segmentation accuracy using overlap measure,
Tanimoto index, Rand index, F-score, and Hausdorff distance measure.
Quantitative and qualitative results show that our algorithm provides improved
segmentation accuracy compared to existing algorithms.

(2D-signal) into $k\geq 1$ block matrices (axis-parallel rectangles, leaves)
where each rectangle is assigned a real label. Its regression or classification
loss to a given matrix $D$ of $N$ entries (labels) is the sum of squared
differences over every label in $D$ and its assigned label by $t$. Given an
error parameter $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, a $(k,\varepsilon)$-coreset $C$ of $D$
is a small summarization that provably approximates this loss to \emph{every}
such tree, up to a multiplicative factor of $1\pm\varepsilon$. In particular,
the optimal $k$-tree of $C$ is a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the optimal
$k$-tree of $D$.
  We provide the first algorithm that outputs such a $(k,\varepsilon)$-coreset
for \emph{every} such matrix $D$. The size $|C|$ of the coreset is polynomial
in $k\log(N)/\varepsilon$, and its construction takes $O(Nk)$ time. This is by
forging a link between decision trees from machine learning -- to partition

applying our coresets on real-world data-sets boosts the computation time of
random forests and their parameter tuning by up to x$10$, while keeping similar

The resulting optimal control problem has a cost function that depends on the
measurements and the closed-loop dynamics under optimal control coincides with
the posterior distribution over the trajectories for the corresponding
estimation problem. This type of stochastic optimal control problem can be
solved using a remarkable technique known as path integral control. By
recursively solving these optimal control problems using path integral control
as new measurements become available we obtain an optimal control-based
particle filtering algorithm. A distinguishing feature of the proposed method
is that it uses the measurements over a finite-length time window instead of a

probability of a binary outcome based on a collection of covariates. However,
the classical formulation of logistic regression relies on the independent
sampling assumption, which is often violated when the outcomes interact through
an underlying network structure. This necessitates the development of models
that can simultaneously handle both the network peer-effect (arising from
neighborhood interactions) and the effect of high-dimensional covariates. In
this paper, we develop a framework for incorporating such dependencies in a
high-dimensional logistic regression model by introducing a quadratic
interaction term, as in the Ising model, designed to capture pairwise
interactions from the underlying network. The resulting model can also be
viewed as an Ising model, where the node-dependent external fields linearly
encode the high-dimensional covariates. We propose a penalized maximum
pseudo-likelihood method for estimating the network peer-effect and the effect
of the covariates, which, in addition to handling the high-dimensionality of
the parameters, conveniently avoids the computational intractability of the
maximum likelihood approach. Consequently, our method is computationally
efficient and, under various standard regularity conditions, our estimate
attains the classical high-dimensional rate of consistency. In particular, our
results imply that even under network dependence it is possible to consistently
estimate the model parameters at the same rate as in classical logistic
regression, when the true parameter is sparse and the underlying network is not
too dense. As a consequence of the general results, we derive the rates of
consistency for various natural network models. We also develop an efficient
algorithm for computing the estimates and validate our theoretical results in
numerical experiments.

detailed modeling of the dynamical evolution of these structures is
computationally costly, an efficient method for computing approximate but quick
physics-based solutions is to rely on space integrated 0D simulations. The
enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops EBTEL framework is a commonly used
method to study the exchange of mass and energy between the corona and
transition region. EBTEL solves for density, temperature, and pressure averaged
over the coronal part of the loop, the velocity at the coronal base, and the
instantaneous differential emission measure distribution in the transition
region. The current single-fluid version of the code, EBTEL2, assumes that at
all stages the flows are subsonic. However, sometimes the solutions show the
presence of supersonic flows during the impulsive phase of heat input. It is
thus necessary to account for this effect. Here, we upgrade EBTEL2 to EBTEL3 by
including the kinetic energy term in the Navier-Stokes equation. We compare the
solutions from EBTEL3 with those obtained using EBTEL2 as well as the
state-of-the-art field-aligned hydrodynamics code HYDRAD. We find that the
match in pressure between EBTEL3 and HYDRAD is better than that between EBTEL2
and HYDRAD. Additionally, the velocities predicted by EBTEL3 are in close
agreement with those obtained with HYDRAD when the flows are subsonic. However,
EBTEL3 solutions deviate substantially from HYDRAD's when the latter predicts
supersonic flows. Using the mismatches in the solution, we propose a criterion
to determine the conditions under which EBTEL can be used to study flows in the
system.

recordings. The massive amount of available field recordings of birds presents
an opportunity to use machine learning to automatically track bird populations.
However, it also poses a problem: such field recordings typically contain
significant environmental noise and overlapping vocalizations that interfere
with classification. The widely available training datasets for species
identification also typically leave background species unlabeled. This leads
classifiers to ignore vocalizations with a low signal-to-noise ratio. However,
recent advances in unsupervised sound separation, such as \emph{mixture
invariant training} (MixIT), enable high quality separation of bird songs to be
learned from such noisy recordings. In this paper, we demonstrate improved
separation quality when training a MixIT model specifically for birdsong data,
outperforming a general audio separation model by over 5 dB in SI-SNR
improvement of reconstructed mixtures. We also demonstrate precision
improvements with a downstream multi-species bird classifier across three
independent datasets. The best classifier performance is achieved by taking the
maximum model activations over the separated channels and original audio.
Finally, we document additional classifier improvements, including taxonomic
classification, augmentation by random low-pass filters, and additional channel
normalization.

parameters as they pretrain on a vast amount of web corpus, which is often
utilized for performing knowledge-dependent downstream tasks such as question
answering, fact-checking, and open dialogue. In real-world scenarios, the world
knowledge stored in the LMs can quickly become outdated as the world changes,
but it is non-trivial to avoid catastrophic forgetting and reliably acquire new
knowledge while preserving invariant knowledge. To push the community towards
better maintenance of ever-changing LMs, we formulate a new continual learning
(CL) problem called Continual Knowledge Learning (CKL). We construct a new
benchmark and metric to quantify the retention of time-invariant world
knowledge, the update of outdated knowledge, and the acquisition of new
knowledge. We adopt applicable recent methods from literature to create several
strong baselines. Through extensive experiments, we find that CKL exhibits
unique challenges that are not addressed in previous CL setups, where parameter
expansion is necessary to reliably retain and learn knowledge simultaneously.
By highlighting the critical causes of knowledge forgetting, we show that CKL
is a challenging and important problem that helps us better understand and
train ever-changing LMs. The benchmark datasets, evaluation script, and

other hand, recent works in optical computational imaging have demonstrated
growing success of simultaneous learning-based design of the acquisition and

to learn MIMO acquisition parameters in the form of receive (Rx) antenna
elements locations jointly with an image neural-network based reconstruction.
To this end, we propose an algorithm for training the combined

unrealistic (or suboptimal) hypotheses on the denoiser, or limited to strongly
convex data terms. In this work, we propose a new type of Plug-and-Play

with highly sparse rewards. Since an exhaustive search of those spaces is not
feasible, humans utilize relevant domain knowledge to condense the search
space. Previously, deep learning agents (DLAgents) were introduced to use
visual imitation learning to model design domain knowledge. This note builds on
DLAgents and integrates them with one-step lookahead search to develop
goal-directed agents capable of enhancing learned strategies for sequentially
generating designs. Goal-directed DLAgents can employ human strategies learned
from data along with optimizing an objective function. The visual imitation
network from DLAgents is composed of a convolutional encoder-decoder network,
acting as a rough planning step that is agnostic to feedback. Meanwhile, the
lookahead search identifies the fine-tuned design action guided by an
objective. These design agents are trained on an unconstrained truss design
problem that is modeled as a sequential, action-based configuration design
problem. The agents are then evaluated on two versions of the problem: the
original version used for training and an unseen constrained version with an
obstructed construction space. The goal-directed agents outperform the human
designers used to train the network as well as the previous objective-agnostic
versions of the agent in both scenarios. This illustrates a design agent
framework that can efficiently use feedback to not only enhance learned design
strategies but also adapt to unseen design problems.

enhanced significantly in the valence fluctuation regime. It is caused by the
order $V$ energy shift of the impurity level, induced in the presence of the
tunneling or bias asymmetry. Furthermore, in the valence fluctuation regime, we
also find that the order $V^3$ nonlinear current exhibits a shoulder structure,

fundamental requirement in many information-processing tasks. Such ability is
determined by the causal structure connecting the parties, and more generally,
by the intermediate processes carrying signals from one laboratory to another.
Here we build a fully fledged resource theory of causal connection for all
multi-party communication scenarios, encompassing those where the parties
operate in a definite causal order and also where the order is indefinite. We
define and characterize the set of free processes and three different sets of
free transformations thereof, resulting in three distinct resource theories of
causal connection. In the causally ordered setting, we identify the most
resourceful processes in the bipartite and tripartite scenarios. In the general
setting, instead, our results suggest that there is no global most valuable
resource. We establish the signalling robustness as a resource monotone of
causal connection and provide tight bounds on it for many pertinent sets of
processes. Finally, we introduce a resource theory of causal non-separability,
and show that it is -- in contrast to the case of causal connection -- unique.
Together our results offer a flexible and comprehensive framework to quantify
and transform general quantum processes, as well as insights into their
multi-layered causal connection structures.

properties of the systems without the additional metallic lead are then
extrapolated in a controlled way from the broadened subgap spectral functions.
We show that a broad class of narrow-gap-semiconductor tunneling densities of

superconducting counterpart. Namely, $0$ phase which is marked by the singlet
ground state and the $\pi$ phase regime with the doublet ground state. To keep
a close analogy with the superconducting case, we focus on the influence of
particle-hole asymmetry of the TDOS of the subgap spectral features.
Nevertheless, we also discus the possibility of inducing singlet-doublet
quantum phase transitions in experimental setups by varying the filling of the

demonstrate that all subgap peaks may leak out of the gap into the continuous
part of the spectrum, an effect which has no counterpart in the superconducting

the near- (or above-) Eddington luminosity (due to opacity enhancements at

  Regularization Effects of Gradient Flow","accepted by Machine Learning",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely used as an effective
technique for feature extraction and dimension reduction. In the High Dimension
Low Sample Size (HDLSS) setting, one may prefer modified principal components,
with penalized loadings, and automated penalty selection by implementing model
selection among these different models with varying penalties. The earlier work
[1, 2] has proposed penalized PCA, indicating the feasibility of model
selection in $L_2$- penalized PCA through the solution path of Ridge
regression, however, it is extremely time-consuming because of the intensive
calculation of matrix inverse. In this paper, we propose a fast model selection
method for penalized PCA, named Approximated Gradient Flow (AgFlow), which
lowers the computation complexity through incorporating the implicit
regularization effect introduced by (stochastic) gradient flow [3, 4] and
obtains the complete solution path of $L_2$-penalized PCA under varying
$L_2$-regularization. We perform extensive experiments on real-world datasets.
AgFlow outperforms existing methods (Oja [5], Power [6], and Shamir [7] and the
vanilla Ridge estimators) in terms of computation costs.

multiple convex functions effectively when an efficient gradient oracle or

machine learning applications: (i) instead of full gradients only stochastic
gradients may be available; and (ii) instead of proximal operators, using
subgradients to handle complex penalty functions may be more efficient and
realistic. Motivated by these concerns, we analyze three potentially valuable
extensions of TOS. The first two permit using subgradients and stochastic
gradients, and are shown to ensure a $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ convergence
rate. The third extension AdapTOS endows TOS with adaptive step-sizes. For the
important setting of optimizing a convex loss over the intersection of convex
sets AdapTOS attains universal convergence rates, i.e., the rate adapts to the
unknown smoothness degree of the objective. We compare our proposed methods
with competing methods on various applications.

polynomial-time algorithm that solves $P$ using queries to an oracle of $P$
whose sizes are upper-bounded by some polynomial in the parameter. Here the
term ""polynomial"" refers to the bound on the query sizes, as the running time
of any kernel is required to be polynomial. One of the most important open
goals in parameterized complexity is to understand the applicability and
limitations of polynomial Turing Kernels. As any fixed-parameter tractable
problem admits a Turing kernel of some size, the focus has mostly being on
determining which problems admit such kernels whose query sizes can be indeed
bounded by some polynomial.
  In this paper we take a different approach, and instead focus on the number
of queries that a Turing kernel uses, assuming it is restricted to using only
polynomial sized queries. Our study focuses on one the main problems studied in
parameterized complexity, the Clique problem: Given a graph $G$ and an integer
$k$, determine whether there are $k$ pairwise adjacent vertices in $G$. We show
that Clique parameterized by several structural parameters exhibits the
following phenomena:
  - It admits polynomial Turing kernels which use a sublinear number of
queries, namely $O(n/\log^c n)$ queries where $n$ is the total size of the
graph and $c$ is any constant. This holds even for a very restrictive type of
Turing kernels which we call OR-kernels.
  - It does not admit polynomial Turing kernels which use $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$
queries, unless NP$\subseteq$coNP/poly.
  For proving the second item above, we develop a new framework for bounding
the number of queries needed by polynomial Turing kernels. This framework is
inspired by the standard lower bounds framework for Karp kernels, and while it
is quite similar, it still requires some novel ideas to allow its extension to
the Turing setting.

Current methods to accurately diagnose ASD are invasive, time-consuming, and
tedious. They can also be subjective perspectives of a number of clinicians
involved, including pediatricians, speech pathologists, psychologists, and

research focuses on computational linguistics and machine learning using speech
data from TalkBank, the world's largest spoken language database. We used data
of both ASD and Typical Development (TD) in children from TalkBank to develop
machine learning models to accurately predict ASD. More than 50 features were

considerable insight about the structure of a signal can be obtained from the

are not immediately apparent due to phase discontinuity. To reveal meaningful
phase structures, alternative phase representations such as the modified group

accompanied by severe security concerns, face forgery detection has become a
recent research hotspot. Most existing detection methods train a binary
classifier under global supervision to judge real or fake. However, advanced
manipulations only perform small-scale tampering, posing challenges to
comprehensively capture subtle and local forgery artifacts, especially in high
compression settings and cross-dataset scenarios. To address such limitations,
we propose a novel framework named Multi-modal Contrastive Classification by
Locally Correlated Representations(MC-LCR), for effective face forgery
detection. Instead of specific appearance features, our MC-LCR aims to amplify
implicit local discrepancies between authentic and forged faces from both
spatial and frequency domains. Specifically, we design the shallow style
representation block that measures the pairwise correlation of shallow feature
maps, which encodes local style information to extract more discriminative
features in the spatial domain. Moreover, we make a key observation that subtle
forgery artifacts can be further exposed in the patch-wise phase and amplitude
spectrum and exhibit different clues. According to the complementarity of
amplitude and phase information, we develop a patch-wise amplitude and phase
dual attention module to capture locally correlated inconsistencies with each
other in the frequency domain. Besides the above two modules, we further
introduce the collaboration of supervised contrastive loss with cross-entropy
loss. It helps the network learn more discriminative and generalized
representations. Through extensive experiments and comprehensive studies, we
achieve state-of-the-art performance and demonstrate the robustness and

Reinforcement Learning. First, we train a policy by using the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm and the Hindsight Experience Replay
technique, where the goal is to control a robotic manipulator to manipulate a
lever. This enables us both to use continuous states and actions and to learn
with sparse rewards. Being able to learn from sparse rewards is especially
desirable for Deep Reinforcement Learning because designing a reward function
for complex tasks such as this is challenging. We first train in the PyBullet
simulator, which accelerates the training procedure, but is not accurate on
this task compared to the real-world environment. After completing the training
in PyBullet, we further train in the Gazebo simulator, which runs more slowly
than PyBullet, but is more accurate on this task. We then transfer the policy
to the real-world environment, where it achieves comparable performance to the
simulated environments for most episodes. To explain the decisions of the
policy we use the SHAP method to create an explanation model based on the
episodes done in the real-world environment. This gives us some results that
agree with intuition, and some that do not. We also question whether the
independence assumption made when approximating the SHAP values influences the
accuracy of these values for a system such as this, where there are some
correlations between the states.

popular mechanism for enforcing convergence of distributed gradient-based
optimization methods enhanced with communication compression strategies based
on the application of contractive compression operators. However, existing
theory of EF relies on very strong assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients), and
provides pessimistic convergence rates (e.g., while the best known rate for EF
in the smooth nonconvex regime, and when full gradients are compressed, is
$O(1/T^{2/3})$, the rate of gradient descent in the same regime is $O(1/T)$).
Recently, Richt\'{a}rik et al. (2021) proposed a new error feedback mechanism,
EF21, based on the construction of a Markov compressor induced by a contractive
compressor. EF21 removes the aforementioned theoretical deficiencies of EF and
at the same time works better in practice. In this work we propose six
practical extensions of EF21, all supported by strong convergence theory:
partial participation, stochastic approximation, variance reduction, proximal
setting, momentum and bidirectional compression. Several of these techniques
were never analyzed in conjunction with EF before, and in cases where they were
(e.g., bidirectional compression), our rates are vastly superior.

whether their surfaces could be habitable is becoming more pertinent. On Earth,
the long-term carbonate silicate cycle is able to regulate surface temperatures
over timescales larger than one million years. Elevated temperatures enhance
weathering, removing CO$_2$ from the atmosphere, which is subducted into the
mantle. At mid-ocean ridges, CO$_2$ is supplied to the atmosphere from the
interior. The carbon degassing flux is controlled by the melting depth beneath
mid-ocean ridges and the spreading rate, influenced by the pressure- and
temperature-dependent mantle viscosity. The influences of temperature and
pressure on mantle degassing become increasingly important for more massive
planets. Here, we couple a thermal evolution model of Earth-like planets of
different masses with a model of the long-term carbon cycle and assess their
surface temperature evolution. We find that the spreading rate at 4.5 Gyr
increases with planetary mass up to 3 $M_\oplus$, since the
temperature-dependence of viscosity dominates over its pressure-dependency. For
higher mass planets, pressure-dependence dominates and the plates slow down. In
addition, the effective melting depth at 4.5 Gyr as a function of planetary
mass has its maximum at 3 $M_\oplus$. Altogether, at 4.5 Gyr, the degassing
rate and therefore surface temperature have their maximum at 3 $M_\oplus$. This
work emphasizes that both age and mass should be considered when predicting the
habitability of exoplanets. Despite these effects, the long-term carbon cycle
remains an effective mechanism that regulates the surface temperature of
massive Earth-like planets.

of communication rounds, and the reliance on {\em independent} stochastic
communication compression operators, which leads to a reduction in the number
of transmitted bits within each communication round. In this paper we i) extend
the theory of MARINA to support a much wider class of potentially {\em

independent compressors setting, ii) show that a new quantity, for which we
coin the name {\em Hessian variance}, allows us to significantly refine the

identify a special class of correlated compressors based on the idea of {\em

evasion attacks; however, their practicality in manipulating real-world malware
remains arguable. The majority of studies have assumed attackers know the
details of the target classifiers used for malware detection, while in reality,
malicious actors have limited access to the target classifiers. This paper
presents a practical evasion attack, EvadeDroid, to circumvent black-box
Android malware detectors. In addition to generating real-world adversarial
malware, the proposed evasion attack can also preserve the functionality of the
original malware samples. EvadeDroid prepares a collection of
functionality-preserving transformations using an n-gram-based similarity
method, which are then used to morph malware instances into benign ones via an
iterative and incremental manipulation strategy. The proposed manipulation
technique is a novel, query-efficient optimization algorithm with the aim of
finding and injecting optimal sequences of transformations into malware
samples. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of EvadeDroid under
hard- and soft-label attacks. Moreover, EvadeDroid is capable to generate
practical adversarial examples with only a small number of queries, with
evasion rates of $81\%$, $73\%$, $75\%$, and $79\%$ for DREBIN, Sec-SVM,

occupancy detection. While deep models have achieved remarkable progress in
general object detection, they are not satisfying enough in complex indoor
scenes. The indoor surveillance video often includes cluttered background
objects, among which heads have small scales and diverse poses. In this paper,
we propose Motion-aware Pseudo Siamese Network (MPSN), an end-to-end approach
that leverages head motion information to guide the deep model to extract
effective head features in indoor scenarios. By taking the pixel-wise
difference of adjacent frames as the auxiliary input, MPSN effectively enhances
human head motion information and removes the irrelevant objects in the
background. Compared with prior methods, it achieves superior performance on
the two indoor video datasets. Our experiments show that MPSN successfully
suppresses static background objects and highlights the moving instances,
especially human heads in indoor videos. We also compare different methods to
capture head motion, which demonstrates the simplicity and flexibility of MPSN.
To validate the robustness of MPSN, we conduct adversarial experiments with a
mathematical solution of small perturbations for robust model selection.
Finally, for confirming its potential in building control systems, we apply
MPSN to occupancy counting. Code is available at

multiphase transport with interface transfer, single-phase flow in multiscale
porous media, and reactive transport with mineral dissolution. In this paper,
we present GeoChemFoam's novel numerical model for simulation of conjugate heat
transfer in micro-CT images of porous media. GeoChemFoam uses the
micro-continuum approach to describe the fluid-solid interface using the volume
fraction of fluid and solid in each computational cell. The velocity field is
solved using Brinkman's equation with permeability calculated using the
Kozeny-Carman equation which results in a near-zero permeability in the solid
phase. Conjugate heat transfer is then solved with heat convection where the
velocity is non-zero, and the thermal conductivity is calculated as the
harmonic average of phase conductivity weighted by the phase volume fraction.
Our model is validated by comparison with the standard two-medium approach for
a simple 2D geometry. We then simulate conjugate heat transfer and calculate
heat transfer coefficients for different flow regimes and injected fluid
analogous to injection into a geothermal reservoir in a micro-CT image of
Bentheimer sandstone and perform a sensitivity analysis in a porous heat
exchanger with a random sphere packing.

of the full potentials of VLC, namely, limited modulation bandwidth, ambient
light interference, optical diffuse reflection effects, devices non-linearity,
and random receiver orientation. On the contrary, centralized machine learning
(ML) techniques have demonstrated a significant potential in handling different
challenges relating to wireless communication systems. Specifically, it was
shown that ML algorithms exhibit superior capabilities in handling complicated
network tasks, such as channel equalization, estimation and modeling, resources
allocation, and opportunistic spectrum access control, to name a few.
Nevertheless, concerns pertaining to privacy and communication overhead when
sharing raw data of the involved clients with a server constitute major
bottlenecks in the implementation of centralized ML techniques. This has
motivated the emergence of a new distributed ML paradigm, namely federated
learning (FL), which can reduce the cost associated with transferring raw data,
and preserve privacy by training ML models locally and collaboratively at the
clients' side. Hence, it becomes evident that integrating FL into VLC networks
can provide ubiquitous and reliable implementation of VLC systems. With this
motivation, this is the first in-depth review in the literature on the
application of FL in VLC networks. To that end, besides the different
architectures and related characteristics of FL, we provide a thorough overview
on the main design aspects of FL based VLC systems. Finally, we also highlight
some potential future research directions of FL that are envisioned to
substantially enhance the performance and robustness of VLC systems.

noise will inevitably shift the solution towards the conditional distribution
over noisy labels. Nevertheless, while deep neural networks have proven capable
of fitting random labels, regularisation and the use of robust loss functions
empirically mitigate the effects of label noise. However, such observations
concern robustness in accuracy, which is insufficient if reliable uncertainty
quantification is critical. We demonstrate this by analysing the properties of
the conditional distribution over noisy labels for an input-dependent noise
model. In addition, we evaluate the set of robust loss functions characterised
by noise-insensitive, asymptotic risk minimisers. We find that strictly proper
and robust loss functions both offer asymptotic robustness in accuracy, but
neither guarantee that the final model is calibrated. Moreover, even with
robust loss functions, overfitting is an issue in practice. With these results,
we aim to explain observed robustness of common training practices, such as
early stopping, to label noise. In addition, we aim to encourage the
development of new noise-robust algorithms that not only preserve accuracy but

has a low frequency turn-over. This is used to show that its magnetic field
strength is likely to be at least 10 mG, which is roughly two orders of
magnitude larger than previously estimated. The earlier, lower value is due to
an overestimate of the emission volume together with an omission of the
dependence of the minimum magnetic field on the synchrotron spectral index.
Since the source is partially resolved, this implies a low volume filling
factor for the synchrotron emission. It is argued that the high pressure needed
to account for the observations is due to shocks. In addition, cooling of the
thermal gas is probably necessary in order to further enhance the magnetic
field strength as well as the density of relativistic electrons. It is
suggested that the observed spectral index implies that the energy of the radio
emitting electrons is below that needed to take part in first order Fermi
acceleration. Hence, the radio emission gives insights to the properties of its
pre-acceleration phase. Attention is also drawn to the similarities between the
properties of radio knot C and the shock induced radio emission in supernovae.

is challenging especially in the case where the number of samples is limited

being too narrow, resulting in several attempts at constructing guidelines in
favor of specific desiderata or arguing against the validity of prevalent

of a precise formulation of desiderata is an ill-posed one, as diverse
applications may always warrant distinct scenarios. Instead, we introduce the
Continual Learning EValuation Assessment Compass: the CLEVA-Compass. The
compass provides the visual means to both identify how approaches are
practically reported and how works can simultaneously be contextualized in the
broader literature landscape. In addition to promoting compact specification in
the spirit of recent replication trends, it thus provides an intuitive chart to

properties based on different inference procedures. To mimic a pipeline such as
that planned for the PLATO mission, all hounds used the same model grid. Some
stars were simulated using the physics adopted in the grid, others a different
one. The maximum relative differences found (in absolute value) between the
inferred and true values of the mass, radius, and age were 4.32 per cent, 1.33
per cent, and 11.25 per cent, respectively. The largest systematic differences
in radius and age were found for a star simulated assuming gravitational
settling, not accounted for in the model grid, with biases of -0.88 per cent

adopting different prescriptions for the surface corrections or shifting the
classical observations by $\pm 1\sigma$. The choice of the relative weight
given to the classical and seismic constraints also impacted significantly the
accuracy and precision of the results. Interestingly, only a few frequencies

smaller model while retaining the performance of the pre-trained model. In this
paper, we propose a simple knowledge distillation (KD) loss function for neural
transducers that focuses on the one-best path in the output probability lattice
under both streaming and non-streaming setups, which allows a small student
model to approach the performance of the large pre-trained teacher model.
Experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset show that despite being 10 times smaller

also desired that the signals' dynamic range should be within that of the
ADC's; otherwise, the signal will be clipped. A modulo operator has been
recently suggested prior to sampling to restrict the dynamic range. Due to the
nonlinearity of the modulo operation, the samples are distorted. Existing

high sampling rate and are not robust in the presence of noise. In this paper,
we propose a robust algorithm to recover the signal from the modulo samples

Euclidean motion invariant/equivariant graph or point cloud neural networks. We
introduce Frame Averaging (FA), a general purpose and systematic framework for
adapting known (backbone) architectures to become invariant or equivariant to
new symmetry types. Our framework builds on the well known group averaging
operator that guarantees invariance or equivariance but is intractable. In
contrast, we observe that for many important classes of symmetries, this
operator can be replaced with an averaging operator over a small subset of the
group elements, called a frame. We show that averaging over a frame guarantees
exact invariance or equivariance while often being much simpler to compute than
averaging over the entire group. Furthermore, we prove that FA-based models
have maximal expressive power in a broad setting and in general preserve the
expressive power of their backbone architectures. Using frame averaging, we
propose a new class of universal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), universal
Euclidean motion invariant point cloud networks, and Euclidean motion invariant

to be in a resonant chain around a red dwarf. We show that all the planets are
simultaneously in two-planet and three-planet resonances, apart from the
innermost pair for which the two-planet resonant angles circulate. By means of
a frequency analysis, we highlight that the transit-timing variation (TTV)
signals possess a series of common periods varying from days to decades, which
are also present in the variations of the dynamical variables of the system.
Shorter periods (e.g., the TTVs characteristic timescale of 1.3 yr) are
associated with two-planet mean-motion resonances, while longer periods arise
from three-planet resonances. By use of $N$-body simulations with migration
forces, we explore the origin of the resonant chain of TRAPPIST-1 and find that
for particular disc conditions, a chain of resonances - similar to the observed
one - can be formed which accurately reproduces the observed TTVs. Our analysis
suggests that while the 4-yr collected data of observations hold key
information on the two-planet resonant dynamics, further monitoring of
TRAPPIST-1 will soon provide signatures of three-body resonances, in particular
the 3.3 and 5.1 yr periodicities expected for the current best-fit solution.
dditional observations would help to assess whether the innermost pair of
planets is indeed resonant (its proximity to the 8:5 resonance being
challenging to explain), and therefore give additional constraints on formation
scenarios.

exciting potential to model spatial contextual structure and conduct flexible

eliminate noise, adaptive wavelet denoising method based on kurtosis-entropy

Helmholtz equation in the presence of self steepening and self frequency shift.
We show that for a particular combination of the self steepening and the self
frequency shift, there is not only chirping but also chirp reversal.
Specifically, the associated nontrivial phase has two intensity dependent
terms, one varies as the reciprocal of the intensity while the other, which
depends on non-Kerr nonlinearities, is directly proportional to the intensity.
This causes chirp reversal across the solitary wave profile. A different
combination of non-Kerr terms leads to chirping but no chirp reversal.The
influence of nonparaxial parameter on physical quantities such as intensity,
speed and pulse-width of the solitary waves is studied too. It is found that
the speed of the solitary waves can be tuned by altering the nonparaxial
parameter. Stable propagation of these nonparaxial solitary waves is achieved
by an appropriate choice of parameters.

be internalised by uninfected cells is described by an infectivity parameter,
which is inferred from available experimental data. The parameter is also able
to describe the effects of changes in the tumour environment that affect viral
uptake from tumour cells. Results show that when a virus is inoculated inside a
growing tumour, strategies for enhancing infectivity do not lead to a complete
eradication of the tumour. Within typical times of experiments and treatments,
we observe the onset of oscillations, which always prevent a full destruction
of the tumour mass. These findings are in good agreement with available
laboratory results. Further analysis shows why a fully successful therapy
cannot exist for the proposed model and that care must be taken when designing
and engineering viral vectors with enhanced features. In particular,
bifurcation analysis reveals that creating longer lasting virus particles or
using strategies for reducing infected cell lifespan can cause unexpected and
unwanted surges in the overall tumour load over time. Our findings suggest that
virotherapy alone seems unlikely to be effective in clinical settings unless
adjuvant strategies are included.

interplay between mechanisms that control this response are not fully
understood. Based on experimental data, we propose a model in which the
dynamics of CD4+ T cell expansion is controlled through the interactions
between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, where T cell stimulation is
proportional to antigen availability and antigen availability is regulated
through downregulation of antigen by T cells. This antigen-dependent-feedback
mechanism operates alongside an intrinsic reduction in cell proliferation rate
that may also be responsible for slowing expansion. Our model can successfully
predict T cell recruitment rates into division, expansion and clonal burst size
per cell when initial precursors are varied or when T cells are introduced late
into an ongoing immune response. Importantly, the findings demonstrate that a
feedback mechanism between T cells and antigen presenting cells, along with a
reduction in cell proliferation rate, can explain the ability of the immune
system to adapt its response to variations in initial conditions or changes
that occur later in the response, ensuring a robust yet controlled line of
defence against pathogens.

domain generalization methods aim to learn ""stable"" feature representations
whose effect on the output remains invariant across domains. Given the
theoretical connection between generalization and privacy, we ask whether
better OOD generalization leads to better privacy for machine learning models,
where privacy is measured through robustness to membership inference (MI)
attacks. In general, we find that the relationship does not hold. Through
extensive evaluation on a synthetic dataset and image datasets like MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, and Chest X-rays, we show that a lower OOD generalization gap
does not imply better robustness to MI attacks. Instead, privacy benefits are
based on the extent to which a model captures the stable features. A model that
captures stable features is more robust to MI attacks than models that exhibit
better OOD generalization but do not learn stable features. Further, for the
same provable differential privacy guarantees, a model that learns stable
features provides higher utility as compared to others. Our results offer the
first extensive empirical study connecting stable features and privacy, and
also have a takeaway for the domain generalization community; MI attack can be
used as a complementary metric to measure model quality.

substructures in the form of two concentric rings. Recent observations with the
Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) have revealed these
features with high angular resolution and have resolved the faint outer ring
well. This allows us to study the nature of the system further.
  Aims. Our aim is to constrain some of the properties of potential planets
embedded in the disk, assuming that they induce the observed rings and gaps.
  Methods. We present the self-calibrated $0.9\,$mm ALMA observations of the
dust continuum emission from the circumstellar disk around HD 100546. These
observations reveal substructures in the disk that are consistent with two
rings, the outer ring being much fainter than the inner one. We reproduced this
appearance closely with a numerical model that assumes two embedded planets. We
varied planet and disk parameters in the framework of the planet-disk
interaction code FARGO3D and used the outputs for the gas and dust distribution
to generate synthetic observations with the code RADMC-3D.
  Results. From this comparison, we find that an inner planet located at $r_1 =
13\,$au with a mass $M_1 = 8 M_{\rm{Jup}}$ and an outer planet located at $r_2
= 143\,$au with a mass $M_2 = 3 M_{\rm{Jup}}$ leads to the best agreement
between synthetic and ALMA observations (deviation less than $3\sigma$ for the
normalized radial profiles). To match the very low brightness of the outer
structure relative to the inner ring, the initial disk gas surface density
profile needs to follow an exponentially tapered power law (self-similar
solution), rather than a simple power-law profile.

raises concerns in data privacy, data portability and data transmission
efficiency. We study unsupervised model adaptation (UMA), or called
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation without Source Data, an alternative setting that
aims to adapt source-trained models towards target distributions without
accessing source data. To this end, we design an innovative historical
contrastive learning (HCL) technique that exploits historical source hypothesis
to make up for the absence of source data in UMA. HCL addresses the UMA
challenge from two perspectives. First, it introduces historical contrastive
instance discrimination (HCID) that learns from target samples by contrasting
their embeddings which are generated by the currently adapted model and the
historical models. With the historical models, HCID encourages UMA to learn
instance-discriminative target representations while preserving the source
hypothesis. Second, it introduces historical contrastive category
discrimination (HCCD) that pseudo-labels target samples to learn
category-discriminative target representations. Specifically, HCCD re-weights
pseudo labels according to their prediction consistency across the current and
historical models. Extensive experiments show that HCL outperforms and
state-of-the-art methods consistently across a variety of visual tasks and
setups.

the speaker code from representing the background noise. Through a range of
experiments conducted on four datasets, our approach consistently demonstrates

field which is eaten-up by the Chern-Simons $3$-form of QCD, thereby making it
massive. This ensures the CP-invariance of the vacuum. Although viewed as an
effective low energy theory, this formulation accomplishes the same goal as

against unwanted UV-corrections. In the previous work it has been shown that
dual formulation is insensitive to UV-physics in the sense that the corrections

Although long short-term memory (LSTM) is attempted to solve this problem

reinforces the memory of the latest musical beat through aggregating beat

component in large-scale industrial manufacturing. However, most recent
researches have focused on anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel
anomaly segmentation network (AnoSeg) that can directly generate an accurate
anomaly map using self-supervised learning. For highly accurate anomaly
segmentation, the proposed AnoSeg considers three novel techniques: Anomaly
data generation based on hard augmentation, self-supervised learning with
pixel-wise and adversarial losses, and coordinate channel concatenation. First,
to generate synthetic anomaly images and reference masks for normal data, the
proposed method uses hard augmentation to change the normal sample
distribution. Then, the proposed AnoSeg is trained in a self-supervised
learning manner from the synthetic anomaly data and normal data. Finally, the
coordinate channel, which represents the pixel location information, is
concatenated to an input of AnoSeg to consider the positional relationship of
each pixel in the image. The estimated anomaly map can also be utilized to
improve the performance of anomaly detection. Our experiments show that the
proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection and anomaly
segmentation methods for the MVTec AD dataset. In addition, we compared the
proposed method with the existing methods through the intersection over union
(IoU) metric commonly used in segmentation tasks and demonstrated the
superiority of our method for anomaly segmentation.

considered as black boxes. The main issue is that the linear and non-linear
operations are entangled in every layer, making it hard to interpret the hidden
layer outputs. In this paper, we look at DNNs with rectified linear units
(ReLUs), and focus on the gating property (`on/off' states) of the ReLUs. We
extend the recently developed dual view in which the computation is broken
path-wise to show that learning in the gates is more crucial, and learning the
weights given the gates is characterised analytically via the so called neural
path kernel (NPK) which depends on inputs and gates. In this paper, we present
novel results to show that convolution with global pooling and skip connection
provide respectively rotational invariance and ensemble structure to the NPK.
To address `black box'-ness, we propose a novel interpretable counterpart of
DNNs with ReLUs namely deep linearly gated networks (DLGN): the pre-activations
to the gates are generated by a deep linear network, and the gates are then
applied as external masks to learn the weights in a different network. The DLGN
is not an alternative architecture per se, but a disentanglement and an
interpretable re-arrangement of the computations in a DNN with ReLUs. The DLGN
disentangles the computations into two `mathematically' interpretable
linearities (i) the `primal' linearity between the input and the
pre-activations in the gating network and (ii) the `dual' linearity in the path
space in the weights network characterised by the NPK. We compare the
performance of DNN, DGN and DLGN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 to show that, the
DLGN recovers more than $83.5\%$ of the performance of state-of-the-art DNNs.

grounded in well-established heterogeneous (degree-based) mean-field theory
commonly used to study dynamical processes on complex networks. Granovetter's
theory is based on two hypotheses that assign different roles to interpersonal,
information-carrying connections. The first hypothesis states that strong ties
carrying the majority of interaction events are located mainly within densely
connected groups of people. The second hypothesis maintains that these groups
are connected by sparse weak ties that are of vital importance for the
diffusion of information - individuals who have access to weak ties have an
advantage over those who do not. Given the scientific collaboration network,
with strength of directed ties measured by the asymmetric fraction of joint
publications, we show that scientific success is strongly correlated with the
structure of a scientist's collaboration network. First, among two scientists,
with analogous achievements, the one with weaker ties tends to have the higher

technique conceived to counteract the loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)

solid-state matter, PMRI is severely restricted by their ultra-short
characteristic relaxation times. Here we demonstrate that efficient hard tissue
prepolarization is within reach with a special-purpose 0.26 T scanner designed
for dental MRI and equipped with suitable high-power electronics. We have
characterized the performance of a 0.5 T prepolarizer module which can be
switched on and off in just 200 us. To that end, we have used resin, dental and
bone samples, all with T1 times in the order of 20 ms at our field strength.
The measured SNR enhancement is in good agreement with a simple theoretical
model, and small deviations in extreme regimes can be attributed to mechanical
vibrations due to the magnetic interaction between the prepolarization and main
magnets. Finally, we argue that these results can be applied to clinical dental
imaging, opening the door to replacing hazardous X-ray systems with low-field
PMRI scanners.

induce combinatorial complexity. For long-horizon tasks, especially when the

First, we propose a TAMP approach (based on Logic-Geometric Programming) that
effectively uses geometry-based heuristics for solving long-horizon
manipulation tasks. The efficiency of this planner is then further improved by
a receding horizon formulation, resulting in RHH-LGP. We demonstrate the
robustness and effectiveness of our approach on a diverse range of long-horizon
tasks that require reasoning about interactions with a large number of objects.
Using our framework, we can solve tasks that require multiple robots, including
a mobile robot and snake-like walking robots, to form novel heterogeneous
kinematic structures autonomously. By combining geometry-based heuristics with
iterative planning, our approach brings an order-of-magnitude reduction of
planning time in all investigated problems.

decades due to their unusual structures and interesting applications. In the
quest for new superhalogens based on boronyl (BO) ligands, we investigate
M(BO)$_{k+1}^-$ anions using high-level ab initio CCSD(T) and B3LYP density
functional method for M = Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, Ca, B, and Al. Their structures
are linear for M = Li, Na, K, trigonal planar M = Be, Mg, Ca, and tetrahedral
for M = B, Al. These anions are energetically and thermodynamically stable
against various fragmentations. Their superhalogen property has been
established due to their higher vertical detachment energy (VDE) than halogen,
being in the range 4.44-7.81 eV. For a given k, the stability and VDE of
M(BO)$_{k+1}^-$ anions decrease with the increase in the size of M, which is
due to a decrease in the charge delocalization on BO moieties. There exists a
linear correlation between frontier orbitals energy gap and VDE with the
coefficient, R$^2$ = 0.93888. It was also noticed that BO ligand, due to lower
dimerization energy, can be preferably used as an inorganic analog of CN. We
believe that these findings should be interesting for researchers working in
superatomic chemistry as well as in boron chemistry. Keywords:

mid-pseudorapidity in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$\,TeV
simulated with the \textsc{PYTHIA 8} Monte Carlo model. The study is performed
as a function of the relative transverse activity classifier, $R_{\rm T}$,
which is the relative charged-particle multiplicity in the transverse region
($\pi/3 <|\Delta\phi| <2\pi/3$) of the di-hadron correlations, and it is
sensitive to the Multi-Parton Interactions. The evolution of the yield of
associated particles on both the toward and the away regions with $3\leq p_{\rm
T}^{\rm assoc.}<8$ GeV/$c$ as a function of $R_{\rm T}$ is investigated. We
propose a strategy which allows for the modelling and subtraction of the
Underlying Event (UE) contribution from the toward and the away regions in
challenging environments like those characterised by large $R_{\rm T}$. We
found that the signal in the away region becomes broader with increasing
$R_{\rm T}$. Contrarily, the yield increases with $R_{\rm T}$ in the toward
region. This effect is reminiscent of that seen in heavy-ion collisions, where
an enhancement of the yield in the toward region for $0-5\%$ central Pb--Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN}=2.76$\,TeV was reported. To further understand
the role of the UE and additional jet activity, the transverse region is
divided into two one-sided sectors, ""trans-max"" and ""trans-min"" selected in
each event according to which region has larger or smaller charged particle
multiplicity. Based on this selection criterion, the observables are studied as
a function of $R_{\rm T}^{\rm max}$ and $R_{\rm T}^{\rm min}$, respectively.

these applications are often composed of various managed and partly managed

composition introduces a new possible fault source and a new layer to obfuscate
faults. Currently, serverless platforms offer only limited support for
identifying runtime faults. Developers looking to observe their serverless
compositions often have to rely on scattered logs and ambiguous error messages
to pinpoint root causes. In this paper, we investigate the use of distributed

To this end, we first introduce a model for characterizing fault observability,
then provide a prototypical tracing implementation - specifically, a

resource utilization), and contribute new insights for troubleshooting

are limited because 2D keypoints do not supervise body shape and segmentations
of people in clothing do not match projected minimally-clothed SMPL shapes. To
exploit richer image information about clothed people, we introduce
higher-level semantic information about clothing to penalize clothed and

regressor using a novel Differentiable Semantic Rendering - DSR loss. For
Minimally-Clothed regions, we define the DSR-MC loss, which encourages a tight

traditional time-domain dedispersion algorithms correct time delays using time
shifts, the FDD algorithm performs these shifts by applying phase rotations to
the Fourier-transformed time-series data. Incoherent dedispersion to many trial
dispersion measures (DMs) is compute, memory-bandwidth and I/O intensive and
dedispersion algorithms have been implemented on Graphics Processing Units
(GPUs) to achieve high computational performance. However, time-domain
dedispersion algorithms have low arithmetic intensity and are therefore often
memory-bandwidth limited. The FDD algorithm avoids this limitation and is
compute limited, providing a path to exploit the potential of current and
upcoming generations of GPUs. We implement the FDD algorithm as an extension of
the DEDISP time-domain dedispersion software. We compare the performance and
energy-to-completion of the FDD implementation using an NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU
against the standard as well as an optimized version of DEDISP. The optimized
implementation already provides a factor of 1.5 to 2 speedup at only 66% of the

algorithm outperforms the optimized time-domain dedispersion algorithm by
another 20% in performance and 5% in energy-to-completion when a large number
of DMs (>=512) are required. The FDD algorithm provides additional performance
improvements for FFT-based periodicity surveys of radio pulsars, as the FFT
back to the time domain can be omitted. We expect that this computational
performance gain will further improve in the future.

cosmological mass density, $\Omega_M$, and the dark energy equation-of-state
parameter, $w$, rely on numerous SNe surveys using distinct photometric systems
across three decades of observation. Here, we determine the sensitivities of
the upcoming SH0ES+Pantheon+ constraints on H$_0$, $\Omega_M$, and $w$ to
unknown systematics in the relative photometric zeropoint calibration between
the 17 surveys that comprise the Pantheon+ supernovae data set. Varying the
zeropoints of these surveys simultaneously with the cosmological parameters, we
determine that the SH0ES+Pantheon+ measurement of H$_0$ is robust against
inter-survey photometric miscalibration, but that the measurements of
$\Omega_M$ and $w$ are not. Specifically, we find that miscalibrated
inter-survey systematics could represent a source of uncertainty in the
measured value of H$_0$ that is no larger than $0.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.
This modest increase in H$_0$ uncertainty could not account for the $7$ km

first order, by $0.04$ and $-0.17$ per $25$ mmag of inter-survey calibration
uncertainty, underscoring the vital role that cross-calibration plays in
accurately measuring these parameters. Because the Pantheon+ compendium
contains many surveys that share low-$z$ Hubble Flow and Cepheid-paired SNe,
the SH0ES+Pantheon+ joint constraint of H$_0$ is robust against inter-survey
photometric calibration errors, and such errors do not represent an impediment
to jointly using SH0ES+Pantheon+ to measure H$_0$ to 1% accuracy.

the nearby universe ($z<0.1$) is critical for using Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia)
to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the equation-of-state parameter of
dark energy ($w$). Here, we study the two dominant 'motions' contributing to
nearby peculiar velocities: large-scale, coherent-flow (CF) motions and
small-scale motions due to gravitationally associated galaxies deemed to be in
a galaxy group. We use a set of 584 low-$z$ SNe from the Pantheon+ sample, and
evaluate the efficacy of corrections to these motions by measuring the
improvement of SN distance residuals. We study multiple methods for modeling
the large and small-scale motions and show that, while group assignments and CF
corrections individually contribute to small improvements in Hubble residual
scatter, the greatest improvement comes from the combination of the two
(relative standard deviation of the Hubble residuals, Rel. SD, improves from
0.167 to 0.157 mag). We find the optimal flow corrections derived from various
local density maps significantly reduce Hubble residuals while raising $H_0$ by
$\sim0.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ as compared to using CMB redshifts,
disfavoring the hypothesis that unrecognized local structure could resolve the
Hubble tension. We estimate that the systematic uncertainties in cosmological
parameters after optimally correcting redshifts are 0.06-0.11 km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ in $H_0$ and 0.02-0.03 in $w$ which are smaller than the statistical
uncertainties for these measurements: 1.5 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for $H_0$ and
0.04 for $w$.

and optoelectronic devices. Earlier studies have found that in type-II
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) HSs, the dominating carrier relaxation
pathway is the interlayer charge transfer (CT) mechanism. Here, this report
shows that, in a type-II HS formed between monolayers of MoSe2 and ReS2,
nonradiative energy transfer (ET) from higher to lower work function material
(ReS2 to MoSe2) dominates over the traditional CT process with and without a
charge-blocking interlayer. Without a charge-blocking interlayer, the HS area
shows 3.6 times MoSe2 photoluminescence (PL) enhancement as compared to the
MoSe2 area alone. After completely blocking the CT process, more than one order
of magnitude higher MoSe2 PL emission was achieved from the HS area. This work
reveals that the nature of this ET is truly a resonant effect by showing that
in a similar type-II HS formed by ReS2 and WSe2, CT dominates over ET,
resulting in a severely quenched WSe2 PL. This study not only provides
significant insight into the competing interlayer processes, but also shows an
innovative way to increase the PL quantum yield of the desired TMD material
using ET process by carefully choosing the right material combination for HS.

applications. During DNA deformation, DNA structural parameters often exhibit
non-trivial and counterintuitive couplings, such as the twist-stretch and
twist-bending couplings. Here, we reveal an unexpectedly strong negative
twist-diameter coupling through the synergy of magnetic-tweezers experiments,
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, and theoretical calculations. In
experiments, the DNA twist angle always increases with the concentration of
NaCl, KCl, or RbCl. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce salt-induced twist
changes and reveal the underlying physical mechanism: the reduction of DNA
diameter under a high salt concentration leads to the increase in DNA twist
angle through a strong negative twist-diameter coupling. The twist-diameter
coupling is mediated by two dihedral angles in DNA structure and the coupling
constant is 4.5 kBT/(deg nm) for one base-pair. Based on this coupling
constant, we predict the temperature-dependence of DNA twist -0.0102 deg/K per
bp, which agrees with our and previous experimental results. Our analysis
suggests that the twist-diameter coupling is a common driving force for salt-

replicated space, we show that the quantum bound to chaos is a direct
consequence of the KMS condition, as applied to a particular pair of two-time
correlation and response functions. Encouraged by this, we describe how quantum
fluctuation-dissipation relations act in general as a blurring of the
time-dependence of correlations, which can imply bounds on their decay rates.
Thinking in terms of fluctuation-dissipation opens a direct connection between
bounds and other thermodynamic properties.

these issues, showing results for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), tungsten

reveal that etching leads to anisotropic hexagonal features in the studied
transition metal dichalcogenides, with the relative degree of anisotropy ranked
as: WS2 > WSe2 > MoTe2 / MoS2. Etched holes are terminated by zigzag edges
while etched dots (protrusions) are terminated by armchair edges. This can be
explained by Wulff constructions, taking the relative stabilities of the edges
and the AA stacking order into account. Patterns in WS2 are transferred to an
underlying graphite layer, demonstrating a possible use for creating sub-10 nm
features. In contrast, multilayer hBN exhibits no lateral anisotropy, but shows
consistent vertical etch angles, independent of crystal orientation. This is
used to create super-resolution lithographic patterns with ultra-sharp corners
at the base of the hBN crystal, which are transferred into an underlying
graphite crystal. We find that the anisotropic SF6 reactive ion etching process
makes it possible to downsize nanostructures to obtain smooth edges, sharp

ability to alter unsafe control inputs explicitly to assure safety. In many
cases, RTA systems can functionally be described as containing a monitor that
watches the state of the system and output of a primary controller, and a
backup controller that replaces or modifies control input when necessary to
assure safety. An important quality of an RTA system is that the assurance
mechanism is constructed in a way that is entirely agnostic to the underlying

Resistive Random Access Memories (RRAM) and neuromorphic computing devices, as

addition, complementary functionalities such as memcapacitance could
significantly improve the performance of bio-inspired devices in key issues
such as energy consumption. However, the physics of mem-systems is not fully
understood so far, hampering their large-scale implementation in devices.
Perovskites that undergo topotactic transitions and redox reactions show
improved performance as mem-systems, compared to standard perovskites. In this
paper we analyze different strategies to optimize the multi-mem behavior
(memristive and memcapacitive) of topotactic redox
La$_{1/2}$Sr$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$Co$_{1/2}$O$_{3-x}$ (LSMCO) films grown on
Nb:SrTiO$_3$ (NSTO). We explored devices with different crystallinity (from
amorphous to epitaxial LSMCO), out-of-plane orientation ((001) and (110)) and
stimulated either with voltage or current pulses. We found that an optimum
memory response is found for epitaxial (110) LSMCO stimulated with current
pulses. Under these conditions, the system efficiently exchanges oxygen with
the environment minimizing, at the same time, self-heating effects that trigger
nanostructural and chemical changes which could affect the device integrity and
performance. Our work contributes to pave the way for the integration of
LSMCO-based devices in cross-bar arrays, in order to exploit their memristive
and memcapacitive properties for the development of neuromorphic or in-memory

fairness outperforms state-of-the-art models on the number of riders serviced,
both in the worst-off neighborhood and overall, showing that optimizing for

by having drivers keep an $r$ fraction of their income, and contributing the
rest to a redistribution pool. For certain values of $r$, most drivers earn
near their Shapley value, while still incentivizing drivers to maximize value,
thereby avoiding the free-rider problem and reducing income variability. The
first method can be extended to many definitions of fairness and the second

of black holes and ECOs within Rastall gravity using Kerr/CFT correspondence.
We systematically investigate the properties of the most general rotating black

its hidden conformal symmetry. The Cardy microscopic entropy formula and
absorption cross-sections from 2D CFT are computed and then matched with
gravity calculation. We also extend the dual CFT analysis for studying the
properties of ECOs. The existence of the quantum membrane leads to the
appearance of the gravitational echoes that is manifested as an oscillatory
feature on the absorption cross-section. We compute the absorption
cross-section and quasi-normal modes in the dual CFT picture. We also compare
the absorption cross-section of ECOs to that of black holes. We find that the
Rastall coupling constant plays a significant role for both objects. We also
obtain that the echo time delay depends explicitly on the Rastall coupling
constant. This coupling constant may play a role to recover the correction on

In view of this, the new 5G Radio Access Technology (RAT) aims to support, in
next releases, Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service Single Frequency Network
(MBSFN) to enable the simultaneous delivery of the same content to a set of
users covered by different cells. According to MBSFN, all cells belonging to
the same MBSFN Area are synchronized in time and the MBSFN transmission occurs
over the same radio resources. In such a way, the same content flow is
delivered by several cells to all the receivers in the MBSFN Area. A further
means to enhance the network coverage and provide high data rate and low
latency in future 5G-enabled MBSFN networks is Device-to-Device (D2D)
connectivity. Along these lines, in this paper we propose a D2D-aided MBSFN
Area Formation (D2D-MAF) algorithm to dynamically create MBSFN Areas with the
aim to improve the system aggregate data rate while satisfying all user
requests. The proposed D2D-MAF foresees that users could receive the service
through either MBSFN, or D2D, or unicast transmissions. Performance evaluation

the rigid transformation to optimally align the source point set with the
target one. Learning robust point cloud registration models with deep neural
networks has emerged as a powerful paradigm, offering promising performance in
predicting the global geometric transformation for a pair of point sets.
Existing methods firstly leverage an encoder to regress a latent shape
embedding, which is then decoded into a shape-conditioned transformation via
concatenation-based conditioning. However, different regions of a 3D shape vary
in their geometric structures which makes it more sense that we have a
region-conditioned transformation instead of the shape-conditioned one. In this
paper we present a \underline{R}egion-\underline{A}ware point cloud
\underline{R}egistration, denoted as RAR, to predict transformation for
pairwise point sets in the self-supervised learning fashion. More specifically,
we develop a novel region-aware decoder (RAD) module that is formed with an
implicit neural region representation parameterized by neural networks. The
implicit neural region representation is learned with a self-supervised 3D
shape reconstruction loss without the need for region labels. Consequently, the
region-aware decoder (RAD) module guides the training of the region-aware
transformation (RAT) module and region-aware weight (RAW) module, which predict
the transforms and weights for different regions respectively. The global
geometric transformation from source point set to target one is then formed by
the weighted fusion of region-aware transforms. Compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches, our experiments show that our RAR achieves
superior registration performance over various benchmark datasets (e.g.
ModelNet40).

Kagome lattices, linegraphs, and more recently moire superlattices. They enable
unique properties including slow light in photonics, correlated phases in
electronics, and supercollimation in both systems. Despite these intense
parallel efforts, flatbands have never been shown to affect the core
light-matter interaction between electrons and photons, which is limited by a
dimensionality mismatch. Here, we reveal that a photonic flatband can overcome
this mismatch between localized electrons and extended photons and thus
remarkably boost their light-matter interaction. We design flatband resonances
in a silicon-on-insulator photonic crystal slab to control and enhance the
radiation emission from free electrons by tuning their trajectory and velocity.
In particular, we record a 100-fold radiation enhancement from the conventional
diffraction-enabled Smith-Purcell radiation, and show the potential of our
approach to achieve $10^6$-fold enhancements and beyond. The enhancement also
enables us to perform polarization shaping of free electron radiation from
multiple flatbands and demonstrate an approach to measure photonic bands via
angle-resolved electron-beam measurements. Our results suggest flatbands as
ideal test beds for strong light-electron interaction in various systems, with
particular relevance for efficient and compact free-electron light sources and
accelerators.

which induces orders of magnitude larger volume of data movement than training
a single DNN model. In this paper, we reveal that the root cause for BNN
training inefficiency originates from the massive off-chip data transfer by
Gaussian Random Variables (GRVs). To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel
design that eliminates all the off-chip data transfer by GRVs through the
reversed shifting of Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) without incurring
any training accuracy loss. To efficiently support our LFSR reversion strategy
at the hardware level, we explore the design space of the current DNN
accelerators and identify the optimal computation mapping scheme to best
accommodate our strategy. By leveraging this finding, we design and prototype
the first highly efficient BNN training accelerator, named Shift-BNN, that is
low-cost and scalable. Extensive evaluation on five representative BNN models

with long-range multi-body interactions resulting from the Trotter-Suzuki
decomposition of the time-evolution operator. We identify a regime where the
Floquet operator underlying the Trotter decomposition undergoes sharp changes
even for small variations in the simulation step size. This results in a time
evolution operator that is very different from the dynamics generated by the
targeted Hamiltonian, which leads to a proliferation of errors in the quantum
simulation. These regions of sharp change in the Floquet operator, referred to
as structural instability regions, appear typically at intermediate Trotter
step sizes and in the weakly-interacting regime, and are thus complementary to
recently revealed quantum chaotic regimes of the Trotterized evolution
(Sieberer et al., npj Quantum Information 5, 1 (2019)). We characterize these
structural instability regimes in $p$-spin models, transverse-field Ising
models with all-to-all $p$-body interactions, and analytically predict their
occurrence based on unitary perturbation theory. We further show that the
effective Hamiltonian associated with the Trotter decomposition of the unitary
time-evolution operator, when the Trotter-step size is chosen to be in the
structural instability region, is very different from the target Hamiltonian,
which explains the large errors that can occur in the simulation in the regions

communications, where a rotational dipole emits EM signals with angular
momenta. In this paper we analytically derive the electromagnetic fields from a
rotational electric dipole using Fourier transform method, and find that the
radiated fields from the rotational electric dipole carries nonzero energy flow
density in both orbital and spin angular momentum (AM) parts by AM flux
tensors. Intuitively, a rotation of a dipole induces a longitudinal orbital
angular momentum and a longitudinal spin angular momentum both circulating in
the rotation direction. And the binding force for the rotational electric
dipole is then shown to result mainly from the Coulomb fields. We believe that
our work can provide novel communication designs for portable mechanic
antennas.

laws for the interaction between a particle and a target. Each infected
particle affects the interaction region a number $n$ of times, according to its

introduced and studied for list colorings: $P_{\ell}$, the list color function
(1990); DP colorings: $P_{DP}$, the DP color function (2019), and $P^*_{DP}$,
the dual DP color function (2021). For any graph $G$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$,
$P_{DP}(G, m) \leq P_\ell(G,m) \leq P(G,m) \leq P_{DP}^*(G,m)$. A function $f$

Theoretically, they can be obtained by bending half-wavelength resonator
resonators with parallel couplings into a ""U"" shape. The proposed configuration
of the parallel-coupled line resonator is used to design the ML band-pass
filter. The FR4 substrate with a dielectric constant ({\epsilon}r) of 4.3 and
1.6 mm thickness was used. A comparative analysis between the simulated
insertion loss and the reflection coefficient of substrates RO3003 and FR4 was
performed to validate the efficiency of the proposed filter design. Simulation
of PCL filter is accomplished using computer simulation technology (CST) and an
advanced design system (ADS) software. The PCL Bandpass filter was
experimentally validated and a total tally between simulation results and
measured results were achieved demonstrating a well-measured reflection
coefficient. The simulated results obtained by the hairpin ML bandpass filter

post-processing to refine the prediction streams for R-peak localisation. The
post-processing performs signal-processing tasks from as simple as, removing
isolated 0s or 1s in the prediction-stream to sophisticated steps, which
require domain-specific knowledge, including the minimum threshold of a
QRS-complex extent or R-R interval. Often these thresholds vary among
QRS-detection studies and are empirically determined for the target dataset,
which may have implications if the target dataset differs. Moreover, these
studies, in general, fail to identify the relative strengths of deep-learning
models and post-processing to weigh them appropriately. This study classifies
post-processing, as found in the QRS-detection literature, into two levels -
moderate, and advanced - and advocates that the thresholds be learned by an
appropriate deep-learning module, called a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), to avoid
explicitly setting post-processing thresholds. This is done by utilising the
same philosophy of shifting from hand-crafted feature-engineering to
deep-learning-based feature-extraction. The results suggest that GRU learns the
post-processing level and the QRS detection performance using GRU-based
post-processing marginally follows the domain-specific manual post-processing,
without requiring usage of domain-specific threshold parameters. To the best of
our knowledge, the use of GRU to learn QRS-detection post-processing from CNN
model generated prediction streams is the first of its kind. The outcome was
used to recommend a modular design for a QRS-detection system, where the level
of complexity of the CNN model and post-processing can be tuned based on the

convergence to an attractor, even when excluding the task of first identifying
the attractors from the comparison. We showcase the power of our implementation

state spaces, fractal basin boundaries, and interlaced attracting periodic
orbits, among others. The output of our method can be straightforwardly used to
calculate concepts such as basin stability and final state sensitivity.

same size) of the original polygon. A polyomino is a polygon that is formed by
joining one or more unit squares edge to edge. These two notions were first
introduced and investigated by Solomon W. Golomb in the 1950s and popularized
by Martin Gardner in the 1960s. Since then, dozens of studies have been made in
communities of recreational mathematics and puzzles. In this study, we first
focus on the specific rep-tiles that have been investigated in these
communities. Since the notion of rep-tiles is so simple that can be formulated
mathematically in a natural way, we can apply a representative puzzle solver, a
MIP solver, and SAT-based solvers for solving the rep-tile problem in common.
In comparing their performance, we can conclude that the puzzle solver is the
weakest while the SAT-based solvers are the strongest in the context of simple
puzzle solving. We then turn to analyses of the specific rep-tiles. Using some
properties of the rep-tile patterns found by a solver, we can complete analyses
of specific rep-tiles up to certain sizes. That is, up to certain sizes, we can
determine the existence of solutions, clarify the number of the solutions, or
we can enumerate all the solutions for each size. In the last case, we find new
series of solutions for the rep-tiles which have never been found in the
communities.

(RL)-based framework for the design of composite structures which avoids the
need for user-selected training data. For a 5 $\times$ 5 composite design space
comprised of soft and compliant blocks of constituent material, we find that
using this approach, the model can be trained using 2.78% of the total design

RL-based framework is capable of finding designs at a success rate exceeding
90%. The success of this approach motivates future learning frameworks to
utilize RL for the design of composites and other material systems.

dimensional semiconductors (WS$_2$) via optically excited carriers above a
critical carrier density through many body interactions. The above nonlinear
optical transition occurs when excited electron hole pairs in ML WS2 continuum
heavily interact with each other followed by transformation into a collective
electron hole plasma phase (EHP), by losing their identity as individual
quasiparticles. This is manifested by the alluring red-shift-blue-shift
crossover (RBC) phenomena of the excitonic peaks in the emission spectra,
resulting from the synergistic attraction-repulsion processes at the
Mott-transition point. A systematic investigation of many-body effects is
reported on ML WS$_2$, while considering the modulated dielectric screening of
three different substrates, viz., silicon dioxide, sapphire, and gold.
Substrate doping effects on ML WS$_2$ are discussed using the Raman
fingerprints and PL spectral weight, which are further corroborated using
theoretical DFT calculations. Further the substrate dependent excitonic Bohr
radius of ML WS$_2$ is extracted via modelling the emission energy shift with
Lennard-Jones potential. The variation of Mott point as well as excitonic Bohr
radius is explained via substrate induced dielectric screening effect for both
the dielectric substrates, which is however absent in ML WS$_2$ on Au. Our
study therefore reveals diverse many-body ramifications in 2D semiconductors
and offers decisive outlooks on selecting the impeccable substrate materials

for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Language model (LM) fusion-based
approaches require an additional external LM during inference, significantly
increasing the computation cost. To overcome this, we propose an internal LM
adaptation (ILMA) of the E2E model using text-only data. Trained with
audio-transcript pairs, an E2E model implicitly learns an internal LM that
characterizes the token sequence probability which is approximated by the E2E
model output after zeroing out the encoder contribution. During ILMA, we
fine-tune the internal LM, i.e., the E2E components excluding the encoder, to
minimize a cross-entropy loss. To make ILMA effective, it is essential to train
the E2E model with an internal LM loss besides the standard E2E loss.
Furthermore, we propose to regularize ILMA by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the output distributions of the adapted and unadapted
internal LMs. ILMA is the most effective when we update only the last linear
layer of the joint network. ILMA enables a fast text-only adaptation of the E2E
model without increasing the run-time computational cost. Experimented with
30K-hour trained transformer transducer models, ILMA achieves up to 34.9%
relative word error rate reduction from the unadapted baseline.

restricting network slice failures, machine learning-enabled reconfigurable
wireless network solutions are required. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
deep learning model that consists of a convolution neural network (CNN) and
long short term memory (LSTM). The CNN performs resource allocation, network
reconfiguration, and slice selection while the LSTM is used for statistical
information (load balancing, error rate etc.) regarding network slices. The
applicability of the proposed model is validated by using multiple unknown
devices, slice failure, and overloading conditions. The overall accuracy of
95.17% is achieved by the proposed model that reflects its applicability.

motivates the development of intelligent adaptive approaches to spectrum access
that go beyond traditional carrier sensing. We develop a novel distributed
implementation of a policy gradient method known as Proximal Policy
Optimization modelled on a two stage Markov decision process that enables such
an intelligent approach, and still achieves decentralized contention-based
medium access. In each time slot, a base station (BS) uses information from
spectrum sensing and reception quality to autonomously decide whether or not to
transmit on a given resource, with the goal of maximizing proportional fairness
network-wide. Empirically, we find the proportional fairness reward accumulated
by the policy gradient approach to be significantly higher than even a
genie-aided adaptive energy detection threshold. This is further validated by
the improved sum and maximum user throughputs achieved by our approach.

may be used for solving difficult real-world problems. The main difference
between TGP and other GP techniques is that TGP does not explicitly store the
evolved computer programs. In this paper, TGP is used for solving real-world
classification problems taken from PROBEN1. Numerical experiments show that TGP
performs similar and sometimes even better than other GP techniques for the
considered test problems.
