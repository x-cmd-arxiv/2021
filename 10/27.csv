  to UAVs",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cooperating radios can extend their communication range by adjusting their
signals to ensure coherent combining at a destination radio. This technique is
called distributed transmit beamforming. Beamforming (BF) relies on the BF
radios having frequency synchronized carriers and phases adjusted for coherent
combining. Both requirements are typically met by exchanging preambles with the
destination. However, since BF aims to increase the communication range, the
individually transmitted preambles are typically at low SNR and their lengths
are constrained by the channel coherence time. These noisy preambles lead to
errors in frequency and phase estimation, which result in randomly changing BF
gains. To build reliable distributed BF systems, the impact of estimation
errors on the BF gains need to be considered in the design. In this work,
assuming a destination-led BF protocol and Kalman filter for frequency
tracking, we optimize the number of BF radios and the preamble lengths to
achieve reliable BF gain. To do that, we characterize the relations between the
BF gains distribution, the channel coherence time, and design parameters like
the SNR, preamble lengths, and the number of radios. The proposed relations are
verified using simulations and via experiments using software-defined radios in
a lab and on UAVs.

movements of the vehicles. These behaviors may indicate a tendency to perform
riskier maneuvers, consume more fuel or energy, break traffic rules, or drive
carefully. Therefore, this paper presents a driving style recognition using
Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System with Multiple Experts Decision-Making
for classifying drivers into calm, moderate and aggressive. This system
receives as input features longitudinal and lateral kinematic parameters of the
vehicle motion. The type-2 fuzzy sets are more robust than type-1 fuzzy sets
when handling noisy data, because their membership function are also fuzzy
sets. In addition, a multiple experts approach can reduce the bias and
imprecision while building the fuzzy rulebase, which stores the knowledge of
the fuzzy system. The proposed approach was evaluated using descriptive
statistics analysis, and compared with clustering algorithms and a type-1 fuzzy
inference system. The results show the tendency to associate lower kinematic
profiles for the driving styles classified with the type-2 fuzzy inference
system when compared to other algorithms, which is in line with the more
conservative approach adopted in the aggregation of the experts' opinions.

an accretion shock on the disk material. The measured rotational temperatures

Class 0 sources, these shocks are confined to the specific disk region impacted
by the streamer. In HL Tau, the known accreting streamer induces a shock in the
disk outskirt, and the released SO and SO$_2$ molecules spiral toward the star
in a few hundreds years. These results suggest that shocks induced by late
accreting material may be common in the disks of young star-forming regions

probe accretion shocks from a larger sample.

perspectives via a manifestly gauge-invariant Hilbert space in the form of
""quantum coordinate transformations"", and we clarify how it is a quantum
extension of special covariance. We model the QRF orientations as coherent
states which give rise to a covariant POVM, furnishing a consistent probability
interpretation and encompassing non-ideal QRFs whose orientations are not
perfectly distinguishable. We generalize the construction of relational
observables, establish a variety of their algebraic properties and equip them
with a transparent conditional probability interpretation. We import the
distinction between gauge transformations and physical symmetries from gauge
theories and identify the latter as QRF reorientations. The ""quantum coordinate
maps"" into an internal QRF perspective are constructed via a conditioning on
the QRF's orientation, generalizing the Page-Wootters formalism and a symmetry
reduction procedure. We find two types of QRF transformations: gauge induced
""quantum coordinate transformations"" as passive unitary changes of description
and symmetry induced active changes of relational observables from one QRF to
another. We reveal new effects: (i) QRFs with non-trivial orientation isotropy
groups can only resolve isotropy-group-invariant properties of other
subsystems; (ii) in the absence of symmetries, the internal perspective Hilbert
space ""rotates"" through the kinematical subsystem Hilbert space as the QRF

by programming individual vehicles on the surface via radio communications,
which becomes impractical with large vehicle numbers; or they require
bi-directional inter-vehicle acoustic communications to achieve limited
coordination when submerged, with limited scalability due to the physical
properties of the acoustic channel. Our approach utilizes a single,
periodically-broadcasting beacon acting as a navigation reference for the group
of AUVs, each of which carries a chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC) and fixed
ultra-short baseline (USBL) array of acoustic receivers. One-way travel-time
(OWTT) from synchronized clocks and time-delays between signals received by
each array element allows any number of vehicles within receive distance to
determine range, angle, and thus determine their relative position to the
beacon. The operator can command different vehicle behaviors by selecting
between broadcast signals from a predetermined set, while coordination between
AUVs is achieved without inter-vehicle communication, by defining individual
vehicle behaviors within the context of the group. Vehicle behaviors are
designed within a beacon-centric moving frame of reference, allowing the
operator to control the absolute position of the AUV group by re-positioning
the navigation beacon to survey the area of interest. Multiple deployments with
a fleet of three miniature, low-cost SandShark AUVs performing closed-loop
acoustic navigation in real-time provide experimental results validated against
a secondary long-baseline (LBL) positioning system, demonstrating the
capabilities and robustness of our approach with real-world data.

entanglement in two-electron spin subsystem (TESSS) by performing some
manipulations on TESSS (the subsystem to which experimentalists have an
access), e.g. repeatable quantum projective measurements of TESSS. Unlike in
the quantum Zeno effect, the goal of the proposed manipulations is not to
freeze TESSS in its initial state and to preclude any time evolution of the
state by infinitely frequent quantum measurements. Instead of that, performing
a few cycles of free evolution of the system for some time $\tau$ followed by a
quantum measurement of TESSS with subsequent postselection of TESSS state (the
same as the initial one) produces quantum correlations in NSEs and also
restores the quantum correlations in TESSS. By numerical calculation of the
system evolution (the full density matrix $\hat \rho(t)$), we show that, in
contrast to the fast decay of TESSS entanglement on timescale of the order of
$T_2^*$, application of the proposed manipulation sequence gradually builds up
coherences in the entire system and the rest decay of quantum correlations of
TESSS may be significantly slowed down for specific cycle durations $\tau$ and
numbers of performed cycles.

competitive behaviors with its nearby agents. Manually designing the
controllers for such SDP system is time-consuming, while the resulting emergent

simulation of SDP systems remains challenging. Reinforcement learning provides
an appealing alternative for automating the development of the controller for
SDP. However, previous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods define
the agents to be teammates or enemies before hand, which fail to capture the
essence of SDP where the role of each agent varies to be cooperative or

is to coordinate agents' behaviors while still maximizing individual

develop a novel MARL method called Coordinated Policy Optimization (CoPO),

be studied using concurrent TMS-fMRI, a technique where TMS is delivered during
fMRI scanning. However, although concurrent TMS-fMRI was developed over 20
years ago and dozens of studies have used this technique, there is still no
consensus on whether TMS increases blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity

previous concurrent TMS-fMRI studies that reported analyses of BOLD activity at
the target location. We find evidence that TMS increases local BOLD activity
when stimulating the primary motor and visual cortices but that these effects
are likely driven by the downstream consequences of TMS (finger twitches and
phosphenes). However, TMS does not appear to increase BOLD activity at the site
of stimulation for areas outside of the primary motor and visual cortices when
conducted at rest. We examine the possible reasons for such lack of BOLD signal
increase based on recent work in non-human animals. We argue that the current
evidence points to TMS inducing periods of increased and decreased neuronal
firing that mostly cancel each other out and therefore lead to no change in the

protoplanetary disks are still imperfectly understood, with an elusive
phenomenon being turbulence in such disks. Observations are available of
planetary systems and of some protoplanetary disks, which can serve as a
starting point for these investigations. Detected systems reveal different
architectures of planets. One particularly interesting case to consider is the
Kepler-223 system, which contains a rare configuration of four planets in a
resonance chain, implying a certain migration history. We aim to use the
orbital configuration of Kepler-223's planets to constrain the parameters of
the protoplanetary disk that allow for the formation of a chain of mean-motion
resonances that resembles the one of Kepler-223. The parameters we aim to
investigate are primarily the disk viscosity and surface density. We use the
swift_symba N-body integrator with additional dissipative forces to mimic
planet-disk interactions. We constrain the surface densities and viscosities
that allow the formation of a resonant chain like that of Kepler-223. We find
that surface densities of up to a few minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) surface
densities and disk viscosity parameters $\alpha$ of a few $10^{-3}$ up to
$10^{-2}$ are most successful at reproducing the architecture of this
particular planetary system. We describe how these two quantities are linked to
each other considering the success of reproducing the chain and find that
higher disk surface densities in turn require lower viscosities to build the
chain. Our results show that well characterized observed planetary systems hold
information about their formation conditions in the protoplanetary disks and
that it is possible to extract this information, namely the initial disk
surface density and viscosity, helping to constrain planet formation.

almost edge-on disk with an outside diameter $\sim$ 100 AU which is heated from
the inside. The high opacity at 220-340 GHz hides the internal structure and
presents a surface temperature $\sim$500 K. Images at 43, 86 and 99 GHz reveal
structure within the disk. At 43 GHz there is bright compact emission with
brightness temperature $\sim$1300 K. Another feature, most prominent at 99 GHz,
is a warped ridge of emission. The data can be explained by a simple model with
a hot inner structure, seen through cooler material. A wide angle outflow
mapped in SiO emission ablates material from the interior of the disk, and
extends in a bipolar outflow over 1000 AU along the rotation axis of the disk.
SiO $v=0$ $J=5-4$ emission appears to have a localized footprint in the warped
ridge. These observations suggest that the ridge is the working surface of the
disk, and heated by accretion and the outflow. The disk structure may be
evolving, with multiple accretion and outflow events. We discuss two sources of
variability: 1) variable accretion onto the disk as Source I travels through
the filamentary debris from the BN-Source I encounter $\sim$550 yr ago; and 2)
episodic accretion from the disk onto the protostar which may trigger multiple
outflows. The warped inner disk structure is direct evidence that SrcI could be
a binary experiencing episodic accretion.

physical reservoir to perform complex time-series processing tasks such as
speech recognition and forecasting. Unlike other machine-learning approaches,
reservoir computing relaxes the need for optimization of intra-network
parameters, and is thus particularly attractive for near-term
hardware-efficient quantum implementations. However, the complete description
of practical quantum reservoir computers requires accounting for their
placement in a quantum measurement chain, and its conditional evolution under
measurement. Consequently, training and inference has to be performed using
finite samples from obtained measurement records. Here we describe a framework
for reservoir computing with nonlinear quantum reservoirs under continuous
heterodyne measurement. Using an efficient truncated-cumulants representation
of the complete measurement chain enables us to sample stochastic measurement
trajectories from reservoirs of several coupled nonlinear bosonic modes under
strong excitation. This description also offers a mathematical basis to
directly compare the computational capabilities of a given physical reservoir
operated across classical and quantum regimes. Applying this framework to the
classification of quantum states of systems that are part of the same
measurement chain as the quantum reservoir computer, we assess and explain
measurement-contingent advantages and disadvantages of reservoir processing in
quantum regimes. Our results also identify the vicinity of bifurcation points
as presenting optimal nonlinear processing regimes of an oscillator-based
quantum reservoir. The considered models are directly realizable in modern
circuit QED experiments, while the framework is applicable to more general
quantum nonlinear reservoirs.

Modes, the number of potentially significant astrophysical contaminants becomes
larger as well. Thermal emission from interplanetary dust, for example, has
been detected by the Planck satellite. While the polarization fraction of this
Zodiacal, or interplanetary dust emission (IPDE) is expected to be low, it is
bright enough to be detected in total power. Here, estimates of the magnitude
of the effect as it might be seen by the LiteBIRD satellite are made. The COBE
IPDE model from Kelsall et al. (1998) is combined with a model of the LiteBIRD
experiment's scanning strategy to estimate potential contamination of the CMB
in both total power and in polarization power spectra. LiteBIRD should detect
IPDE in temperature across all of its bands, from 40 through 402 GHz, and
should improve limits on the polarization fraction of IPDE at the higher end of
this frequency range. If the polarization fraction of IPDE is of order 1%, the
current limit from ISO/CAM measurements in the mid-infrared, it may induce
large-scale polarization B Modes comparable to cosmological models with an r of
order 0.001. In this case, the polarized IPDE would also need to be modeled and
removed. As a CMB foreground, IPDE will always be subdominant to Galactic
emissions, though because it caused by emission from grains closer to us, it
appears variable as the Earth travels around the Sun, and may thereby
complicate the data analysis somewhat. But with an understanding of some of the
symmetries of the emission and some flexibility in the data processing, it
should not be the primary impediment to the CMB polarization measurement.

k$_L$ behavior in BaO, BaS and MgTe by exploring lattice dynamics and phonon
transport of 16 iso-structural MX (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and X = O, S, Se and Te)
compounds in the rocksalt (NaCl)-type structure by comparing their lattice
transport properties with the champion thermoeletric iso-structural material,
PbTe. Anomalous trends are observed for k$_L$ in MX compounds except the MgX
series in contrast to the expected trend from their atomic mass. The underlying
mechanisms for such low k$_L$ behavior in relatively low atomic mass systems
namely BaO, BaS and MgTe compounds are thoroughly analyzed. We propose the
following dominant factors that might be responsible for low k$_L$ behavior in
these materials: 1) softening of transverse acoustic (TA) phonon modes despite
low atomic mass, 2) low lying optic (LLO) phonon modes fall deep into acoustic
mode region which enhances overlap between longitudinal acoustic (LA) and LLO
phonon modes which increases scattering phase space, 3) short phonon lifetimes
and high scattering rates, 4) relatively high density (\r{ho}) and large
Gr\""uneisen parameter. Moreover, tensile strain also causes a further reduction
in k$_L$ for BaO, BaS and MgTe through phonon softening and near ferroelectric
instability. Our comprehensive study on 16 binary MX compounds might provide a
pathway for designing (ultra)low k$_L$ materials even with simple crystal
systems through phonon engineering.

relevant in the context of using anisotropic building blocks with various

polyhedral nematic, and bond orientational order, respectively. For the latter,
a variation of classical bond order parameters is introduced that takes
advantage of the symmetry of constituent particles, and/or expected crystalline
phases. These Symmetrized Bond Order Parameters (SymBOPs) can be averaged over
an entire system, or assigned locally to an individual bond. By combining that
with bond percolation procedure, one is able to identify coherent domains
within a self-assembled structure. As a demonstration of the proposed
framework, we apply it to a simulated hybrid system that combines isotropic and
patchy particles with octahedral symmetry. Not only does the methodology allow
one to identify individual crystalline domains, but it also detects coherent
clusters of a peculiar compact amorphous structure that is not space-filling
and lacks any long-range order.

  Federated Learning from a Client Perspective","To be appeared in NeurIPS 2021 conference",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) is a popular distributed learning framework that
trains a global model through iterative communications between a central server
and edge devices. Recent works have demonstrated that FL is vulnerable to model
poisoning attacks. Several server-based defense approaches (e.g. robust
aggregation), have been proposed to mitigate such attacks. However, we
empirically show that under extremely strong attacks, these defensive methods
fail to guarantee the robustness of FL. More importantly, we observe that as
long as the global model is polluted, the impact of attacks on the global model
will remain in subsequent rounds even if there are no subsequent attacks. In
this work, we propose a client-based defense, named White Blood Cell for
Federated Learning (FL-WBC), which can mitigate model poisoning attacks that
have already polluted the global model. The key idea of FL-WBC is to identify
the parameter space where long-lasting attack effect on parameters resides and
perturb that space during local training. Furthermore, we derive a certified
robustness guarantee against model poisoning attacks and a convergence
guarantee to FedAvg after applying our FL-WBC. We conduct experiments on
FasionMNIST and CIFAR10 to evaluate the defense against state-of-the-art model
poisoning attacks. The results demonstrate that our method can effectively
mitigate model poisoning attack impact on the global model within 5
communication rounds with nearly no accuracy drop under both IID and Non-IID
settings. Our defense is also complementary to existing server-based robust
aggregation approaches and can further improve the robustness of FL under
extremely strong attacks.

with half the mass located at each position or as a quantum superposition with
a far more interesting and subtle behaviour for the gravitational field.
Quantum field theory is ideally suited to probe exactly this kind of question.
We study the scattering of a massless scalar on such a spatially nonlocal,
quantum superposition of a massive particle. We compute the differential
scattering cross section corresponding to the interaction coming from the
exchange of one graviton. We find that the scattering cross section is not at
all represented by the Schr\""odinger-Newton picture of potential scattering
from two localized sources with half the mass at each source. We discuss how
our result would be lethal to the Schr\""odinger-Newton description of

the corresponding Poisson process driven by a random walk model with power-law

showed that the time-scale-independent FS corresponds to essentially a
logarithmic diffusion (i.e., a kind of ultraslow diffusion). In addition, we
confirmed that this relationship is also valid for the actual data. This
finding may contribute to the discovery of actual examples of ultraslow
diffusion, which have been nearly unobserved in spite of many mathematical
theories, because we can detect the time-scale-independent FS more easily and
more distinctly than through direct detection of the logarithmic diffusion

of the velocity birefringence of GWs in their propagation caused by the parity
violation due to the Nieh-Yan term, which are explicitly presented in the GW

LayerZero is the first system to trustlessly enable direct transactions across

by finding a small subset of the input that is sufficient to predict the neural
model output. The selection mechanism is commonly integrated into the model
itself by specifying a two-component cascaded system consisting of a rationale
generator, which makes a binary selection of the input features (which is the
rationale), and a predictor, which predicts the output based only on the
selected features. The components are trained jointly to optimize prediction
performance. In this paper, we reveal a major problem with such cooperative
rationalization paradigm -- model interlocking. Interlocking arises when the
predictor overfits to the features selected by the generator thus reinforcing
the generator's selection even if the selected rationales are sub-optimal. The
fundamental cause of the interlocking problem is that the rationalization
objective to be minimized is concave with respect to the generator's selection
policy. We propose a new rationalization framework, called A2R, which
introduces a third component into the architecture, a predictor driven by soft
attention as opposed to selection. The generator now realizes both soft and
hard attention over the features and these are fed into the two different
predictors. While the generator still seeks to support the original predictor
performance, it also minimizes a gap between the two predictors. As we will
show theoretically, since the attention-based predictor exhibits a better
convexity property, A2R can overcome the concavity barrier. Our experiments on
two synthetic benchmarks and two real datasets demonstrate that A2R can
significantly alleviate the interlock problem and find explanations that better
align with human judgments. We release our code at

High data rate communication is typically along line-of-sight (LoS). In outdoor
environments, such communication is susceptible to temporary blockage by
pedestrians interposed between the transmitter and receiver. It results in
outages in which the user is lost, and has to be reacquired as a new user,
severely disrupting interactive and high throughput applications. It has been
presumed that the solution is to have a densely deployed set of base stations
that will allow the mobile to perform a handover to a different non-blocked
base station every time a current base station is blocked. This is however a
very costly solution for outdoor environments. Through extensive experiments we
show that it is possible to exploit a strong ground reflection with a received
signal strength (RSS) about 4dB less than the LoS path in outdoor built
environments with concrete or gravel surfaces, for beams that are narrow in
azimuth but wide in zenith. While such reflected paths cannot support the high
data rates of LoS paths, they can support control channel communication, and,
importantly, sustain time synchronization between the mobile and the base
station. This allows a mobile to quickly recover to the LoS path upon the
cessation of the temporary blockage, which typically lasts a few hundred
milliseconds. We present a simple in-band protocol that quickly discovers
ground reflected radiation and uses it to recover the LoS link when the
temporary blockage disappears.

  flow and effects of halo shape","Reformatted with data source provided",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Halo-mediated mass and energy cascades are key to understand dark matter
flow. Both cascades origin from the mass exchange between halo and out-of-halo
sub-systems. Kinetic energy can be from the motion of halos and particle motion
in halos. Similarly, potential energy can be due to the inter- and intra-halo
interactions. Intra-halo virial equilibrium is established much faster than
inter-halo. Change of energy of entire system comes from virilization in halos.
At statistically steady state, continuous mass exchange is required to sustain
growth of total halo mass $M_h\propto a^{1/2}$ and energy $E\propto a^{3/2}$,
where $a$ is scale factor. Inverse cascade is identified for kinetic energy
that is transferred from the smallest scale to large mass scales. This is
sustained by the direct cascade of potential energy from large to small scale.
Both energies have a scale- and time-independent flux in propagation range that
is proportional to mass flux. Energy cascade is mostly facilitated by mass
cascade, which can be quantitatively described by mass accretion of typical
halos. Halo radial, angular momentum, and angular velocity are modelled and
inverse cascade is identified for the coherent radial and rotational motion in
halos. In turbulence, vortex stretching (shape changing) along its axis of spin
enables energy cascade from large to small length scales. However, change in
halo shape is not the dominant mechanism for energy cascade as the moment of
inertial gained from shape changing is less than 2 times. Large halos exhibit
preference for prolateness over oblateness and most halos have spin axis
perpendicular to major axis. Since mass cascade is local in mass space, halo
shape evolves continuously in mass space with halos formed by incrementally
inheriting structure from progenitor halos. A unique evolution path of halos is
found that gradually approaches sphere with increasing size.

of heterogeneous graph structures. The dynamics associated with heterogeneity
have posed new challenges for HTG representation learning. To solve this
problem, in this paper, we propose heterogeneous temporal graph neural network
(HTGNN) to integrate both spatial and temporal dependencies while preserving
the heterogeneity to learn node representations over HTGs. Specifically, in
each layer of HTGNN, we propose a hierarchical aggregation mechanism, including
intra-relation, inter-relation, and across-time aggregations, to jointly model
heterogeneous spatial dependencies and temporal dimensions. To retain the
heterogeneity, intra-relation aggregation is first performed over each slice of
HTG to attentively aggregate information of neighbors with the same type of
relation, and then intra-relation aggregation is exploited to gather
information over different types of relations; to handle temporal dependencies,
across-time aggregation is conducted to exchange information across different
graph slices over the HTG. The proposed HTGNN is a holistic framework tailored
heterogeneity with evolution in time and space for HTG representation learning.

number of elements in $U$.
  We study the classification of HAT as recurrent or transient, as the
dimension $d$ and number of elements $n$ in the initial set vary. It was
recently proved that the stationary distribution of HAT (on certain equivalence
classes of sets) exists when $d = 2$, for every number of elements $n \geq 2$.
We prove that HAT exhibits a phase transition in both $d$ and $n$, in the sense
that HAT is transient when $d \geq 5$ and $n \geq 4$.
  Remarkably, transience occurs in only one ""way"": The initial set fragments
into clusters of two or three elements -- but no other number -- which then
grow indefinitely separated. We call these clusters dimers and trimers.
Underlying this characterization of transience is the fact that, from any set,
HAT reaches a set consisting exclusively of dimers and trimers, in a number of
steps and with at least a probability which depend on $d$ and $n$ only.

random walk from $x$. If the walk leaves from $y$ when it first enters $U$, add
$y$ to $U$. Iterating this procedure constitutes the process we call Harmonic
Activation and Transport (HAT).
  HAT exhibits a phenomenon we refer to as collapse: informally, the diameter
shrinks to its logarithm over a number of steps which is comparable to this
logarithm. Collapse implies the existence of the stationary distribution of
HAT, where configurations are viewed up to translation, and the exponential
tightness of diameter at stationarity. Additionally, collapse produces a
renewal structure with which we establish that the center of mass process,
properly rescaled, converges in distribution to two-dimensional Brownian
motion.
  To characterize the phenomenon of collapse, we address fundamental questions
about the extremal behavior of harmonic measure and escape probabilities. Among
$n$-element subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, what is the least positive value of
harmonic measure? What is the probability of escape from the set to a distance
of, say, $d$? Concerning the former, examples abound for which the harmonic
measure is exponentially small in $n$. We prove that it can be no smaller than
exponential in $n \log n$. Regarding the latter, the escape probability is at
most the reciprocal of $\log d$, up to a constant factor. We prove it is always
at least this much, up to an $n$-dependent factor.

videos in neural networks. Unlike conventional representations that treat
videos as frame sequences, we represent videos as neural networks taking frame
index as input. Given a frame index, NeRV outputs the corresponding RGB image.
Video encoding in NeRV is simply fitting a neural network to video frames and
decoding process is a simple feedforward operation. As an image-wise implicit
representation, NeRV output the whole image and shows great efficiency compared
to pixel-wise implicit representation, improving the encoding speed by 25x to
70x, the decoding speed by 38x to 132x, while achieving better video quality.
With such a representation, we can treat videos as neural networks, simplifying
several video-related tasks. For example, conventional video compression
methods are restricted by a long and complex pipeline, specifically designed
for the task. In contrast, with NeRV, we can use any neural network compression
method as a proxy for video compression, and achieve comparable performance to
traditional frame-based video compression approaches (H.264, HEVC \etc).
Besides compression, we demonstrate the generalization of NeRV for video
denoising. The source code and pre-trained model can be found at

efforts to understand how gradient descent (GD) converges to low-loss solutions
that generalize well. Real-life neural networks are initialized from small
random values and trained with cross-entropy loss for classification (unlike
the ""lazy"" or ""NTK"" regime of training where analysis was more successful), and
a recent sequence of results (Lyu and Li, 2020; Chizat and Bach, 2020; Ji and
Telgarsky, 2020) provide theoretical evidence that GD may converge to the
""max-margin"" solution with zero loss, which presumably generalizes well.
However, the global optimality of margin is proved only in some settings where
neural nets are infinitely or exponentially wide. The current paper is able to
establish this global optimality for two-layer Leaky ReLU nets trained with
gradient flow on linearly separable and symmetric data, regardless of the
width. The analysis also gives some theoretical justification for recent
empirical findings (Kalimeris et al., 2019) on the so-called simplicity bias of
GD towards linear or other ""simple"" classes of solutions, especially early in
training. On the pessimistic side, the paper suggests that such results are
fragile. A simple data manipulation can make gradient flow converge to a linear

Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene intrinsically supports a pair of flat bands
predicted to host a variety of spontaneous broken-symmetry states arising from
van Hove singularities and a four-fold spin-valley (isospin) degeneracy. Here,
we show that ultra-clean samples of bilayer graphene display a cascade of
symmetry-broken states with spontaneous and spin and valley ordering at zero
magnetic field. Using capacitive sensing in a dual-gated geometry, we tune the
carrier density and electric displacement field independently to explore the
phase space of transitions and probe the character of the isospin order.
Itinerant ferromagnetic states emerge near the conduction and valence band
edges with complete spin and valley polarization and a high degree of
displacement field tunability. At larger hole densities, two-fold degenerate
quantum oscillations manifest in an additional broken symmetry state that is
enhanced by the application of an in-plane magnetic field. Both types of
symmetry-broken states display enhanced layer polarization at low temperatures,
suggesting a coupling to the layer pseudospin degree of freedom in the
electronic wavefunctions. Notably, the zero-field spontaneous symmetry breaking
reported here emerges in the absence of a moir\'e superlattice and is intrinsic
to natural graphene bilayers. Thus, we demonstrate that the tunable bands of

good agreement between $1.5$ to $3$pMpc from the quasar. This region is far
away from the quasar hosts and hence approaching the mean density of the
universe, which allows us to use the CDF to set constraints on the cosmological
parameter $\sigma_8=0.6\pm0.3$. The uncertainty is mainly due to the limited
number of high-quality quasar sightlines currently available. Utilizing the
more than $>200$ known quasars at $z\gtrsim 6$, this method will allow us in
the future to tighten the constraint on $\sigma_8$ to the percent level. In the
region closer to the quasar within $1.5$ pMpc, we find the density is higher
than predicted in the simulation by $1.23 \pm 0.17$, suggesting the typical
host dark matter halo mass of a bright quasar ($M_{\rm 1450}<-26.5$) at $z\sim
6$ is $\log_{\rm 10} (M/M_\odot)=12.5^{+0.4}_{-0.7}$.

transport of heat, is an outstanding problem, with implications for our
understanding of their thermodynamic history and structure. As the dilute
plasma of the intracluster medium (ICM) is magnetized, heat and momentum travel
preferentially along magnetic field lines. This anisotropy triggers a class of
buoyancy instabilities that destabilize the ICM, and whose turbulent motions
can augment or impede heat transport. We focus on the magneto-thermal
instability (MTI), which may be active in the periphery of galaxy clusters. We
aim to take a fresh look at the problem and construct a general theory that
explains the MTI saturation mechanism and provides scalings and estimates for
the turbulent kinetic energy, magnetic energy, and heat flux. We simulate MTI
turbulence with a Boussinesq code, SNOOPY, which, in contrast to previous work,
allows us to perform an extensive sampling of the parameter space. In two
dimensions the saturation mechanism involves an inverse cascade carrying
kinetic energy from the short MTI injection scales to larger scales, where it
is arrested by the stable entropy stratification; at a characteristic ""buoyancy
scale"", the energy is dumped into large-scale g-modes, which subsequently
dissipate. Consequently, the entropy stratification sets an upper limit on the
size and strength of turbulent eddies. Meanwhile, the MTI conveys a substantial
fraction of heat, despite the tangled geometry of the magnetic field. In a
companion paper, these results are extended to three-dimensional flows, and
compared to real cluster observations.

the observed UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), and by including a population of

the star-formation rate density required to match the UVLFs. Nevertheless, we
forecast high signal-to-noise detections for both HERA and the SKA. We
demonstrate how the stellar-to-halo mass relation of the unseen, first galaxies

each catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a
comparison is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and
of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency
in the resulting photometric redshifts. The $i<21$ sources have sub-percent

fractionalization where quasiparticles carry only a fraction of the charge or

Hall effect. We discuss the observation of fractionalization and anyonic
statistics already in the integer quantum Hall effect coupled to a metallic
island. A continuous fractional emitter is proposed, which sends dilute beams
of non-integer charges, and its full counting statistics is obtained. The
fractional charge is governed solely by the number of ballistic channels
covered by the island and it is one half of the electron charge for a single
ballistic channel. We further characterize the mixing of two such fractional
beams through a quantum point contact beam splitter. We predict negative
cross-correlations, in strong contrast with free electrons, that depend on the
double exchange phase between electrons and the fractional charges emulating
anyons. The result is similar to a genuine fractional edge state as recently
measured at filling $\nu = 1/3$. We revisit the physical interpretation of this

deviation from fermionic antibunching.

neutrinos (RHN) and one vector like fermion in the context of cosmic inflation.
The complex singlet scalar field responsible for the spontaneous breaking of
$B-L$ gauge symmetry is non-minimally coupled to gravity and serves the role of
inflaton. The keV scale vector like fermion DM gives rise to the possibility of
warm dark matter, but it gets overproduced thermally. The subsequent entropy
dilution due to one of the RHN decay can bring the thermal abundance of DM
within the observed limit. The dynamics of both the DM and the diluter are
regulated by the $B-L$ model parameters which are also restricted by the
requirement of successful inflationary dynamics.We constrain the model
parameter space from the requirement of producing sufficient entropy dilution
to obtain correct DM relic, inflationary observables along with other
phenomenological constraints. Interestingly, we obtain unique predictions for
the order of lightest active neutrino mass ($m_{\nu_l}\lesssim 10^{-14}$ eV) as
function of $B-L$ gauge coupling for keV scale DM. The proposed framework also
explains the origin of observed baryon asymmetry from the decay of other two
heavier RHN by overcoming the entropy dilution effect.

The astrometry is tied to the Gaia astrometric reference system, and the
typical astrometric uncertainty for sources with 16<[3.6]<19 is <0.15 arcsec.
The photometric calibration is in excellent agreement with previous WISE

that the Spitzer Space Telescope has now been decommissioned these mosaics are

0.2$^{\prime\prime}$ beam than a 0.9$^{\prime\prime}$ beam, indicative of
possible internal sources of heating. Furthermore, the velocity field includes
a bipolar ${\sim}7{-}8$ km s$^{-1}$ feature with a southeast-northwest
orientation against the surrounding ${\sim}4{-}5$ km s$^{-1}$ velocity field,
which may be due to an outflow. We also find evidence of a possible source of
internal heating toward the Northwest Clump, since the excitation temperature
there is higher in a smaller beam versus a larger beam. Finally, the region
southwest of the Hot Core (Hot Core-SW) presents itself as a particularly
heterogeneous region bridging the Hot Core and Compact Ridge. Additional
studies to identify the (hidden) sources of luminosity and heating within Orion
KL are necessary to better understand the nebula and its chemistry.

the power spectrum. To access this information, we need to model the bispectrum
in the weakly non-linear regime. In this work we present the first two-loop,
i.e., next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative description of the bispectrum
within an effective field theory (EFT) framework. Using an analytic expansion
of the perturbative kernels up to $F_6$ we derive a renormalized bispectrum
that is demonstrated to be independent of the UV cutoff. We show that the EFT
parameters associated with the four independent second-order EFT operators
known from the one-loop bispectrum are sufficient to absorb the UV sensitivity
of the two-loop contributions in the double-hard region. In addition, we employ
a simplified treatment of the single-hard region, introducing one extra EFT
parameter at two-loop order. We compare our results to N-body simulations using
the realization-based grid-PT method and find good agreement within the
expected range, as well as consistent values for the EFT parameters. The
two-loop terms start to become relevant at $k\approx 0.07h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.
The range of wavenumbers with percent-level agreement, independently of the
shape, extends from $0.08h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $0.15h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ when
going from one to two loops at $z=0$. In addition, we quantify the impact of
using exact instead of Einstein-de-Sitter kernels for the one-loop bispectrum,

generation methods are heavily restricted by the rareness and structure of
safety-critical scenarios. Therefore, existing generative models that only
estimate distributions from observational data are not satisfying to solve this
problem. In this paper, we integrate causality as a prior into the scenario
generation and propose a flow-based generative framework, Causal Autoregressive
Flow (CausalAF). CausalAF encourages the generative model to uncover and follow
the causal relationship among generated objects via novel causal masking
operations instead of searching the sample only from observational data. By
learning the cause-and-effect mechanism of how the generated scenario causes
risk situations rather than just learning correlations from data, CausalAF
significantly improves learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three
heterogeneous traffic scenarios illustrate that CausalAF requires much fewer
optimization resources to effectively generate safety-critical scenarios. We
also show that using generated scenarios as additional training samples
empirically improves the robustness of autonomous driving algorithms.

Applying luminosity-metallicity relations derived from BaSTI $\alpha$-enhanced

eventual dominance of radiation pressure in stellar envelope hydrostatic
balance. As the luminosity approaches the Eddington limit, additional
instabilities (beyond conventional convection) can occur. These instabilities
readily manifest in the outer envelopes of OB stars, where the opacity increase
associated with iron yields density and gas pressure inversions in 1D models.
Additionally, recent photometric surveys (e.g. TESS) have detected excess
broadband low frequency variability in power spectra of OB star lightcurves,
called stochastic low frequency variability (SLFV). This motivates our novel 3D
Athena++ radiation hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations of two 35$\,$M$_\odot$ star
envelopes (the outer $\approx$15$\%$ of the stellar radial extent), one on the
zero-age main sequence and the other in the middle of the main sequence. Both
models exhibit turbulent motion far above and below the conventional iron
opacity peak convection zone (FeCZ), obliterating any ``quiet"" part of the
near-surface region and leading to velocities at the photosphere of
10-100$\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$, directly agreeing with spectroscopic data. Surface
turbulence also produces SLFV in model lightcurves with amplitudes and
power-law slopes that are strikingly similar to those of observed stars. The
characteristic frequencies associated with SLFV in our models are comparable to
the thermal time in the FeCZ ($\approx$3-7$\,$days$^{-1}$). These simulations,
which have no free parameters, are directly validated by observations and,
though more models are needed, we remain optimistic that 3D RHD models of main
sequence O star envelopes exhibit SLFV originating from the FeCZ.

interpretation and safety reasons. To better predict the future trajectories of
multiple agents, recent works have introduced interaction modules to capture
interactions among agents. This approach leads to correlations among the
predicted trajectories. However, the uncertainty brought by such correlations
is neglected. To fill this gap, we propose a novel concept, collaborative
uncertainty(CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from the interaction
module. We build a general CU-based framework to make a prediction model to
learn the future trajectory and the corresponding uncertainty. The CU-based
framework is integrated as a plugin module to current state-of-the-art (SOTA)
systems and deployed in two special cases based on multivariate Gaussian and
Laplace distributions. In each case, we conduct extensive experiments on two
synthetic datasets and two public, large-scale benchmarks of trajectory
forecasting. The results are promising: 1) The results of synthetic datasets
show that CU-based framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the
ground-truth distribution. 2) The results of trajectory forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that the CU-based framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve
their performances. Especially, the proposed CU-based framework helps VectorNet
improve by 57cm regarding Final Displacement Error on nuScenes dataset. 3) The
visualization results of CU illustrate that the value of CU is highly related
to the amount of the interactive information among agents.

i.e. high performance over the worst-off samples in the dataset. This problem
has been widely studied in fields such as algorithmic fairness, class
imbalance, and risk-sensitive decision making. A popular approach to maximize
the model's tail performance is to minimize the CVaR (Conditional Value at
Risk) loss, which computes the average risk over the tails of the loss.
However, for classification tasks where models are evaluated by the zero-one
loss, we show that if the classifiers are deterministic, then the minimizer of
the average zero-one loss also minimizes the CVaR zero-one loss, suggesting
that CVaR loss minimization is not helpful without additional assumptions. We
circumvent this negative result by minimizing the CVaR loss over randomized
classifiers, for which the minimizers of the average zero-one loss and the CVaR
zero-one loss are no longer the same, so minimizing the latter can lead to
better tail performance. To learn such randomized classifiers, we propose the
Boosted CVaR Classification framework which is motivated by a direct
relationship between CVaR and a classical boosting algorithm called LPBoost.
Based on this framework, we design an algorithm called $\alpha$-AdaLPBoost. We
empirically evaluate our proposed algorithm on four benchmark datasets and show
that it achieves higher tail performance than deterministic model training
methods.

potentials $\Phi$ while propagating across the Universe. If the potential is
not constant in time, the photons will pick up a net redshift or blueshift,
known as the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. In the $z \ll 1000$ universe,
$\dot{\Phi}$ is nonzero on large scales when the Universe transitions from
matter to dark energy domination. This effect is only detectable in
cross-correlation with large-scale structure at $z \sim 1$. In this paper we
present a 3.2$\sigma$ detection of the ISW effect using cross-correlations
between unWISE infrared galaxies and Planck CMB temperature maps. We use 3
tomographic galaxy samples spanning $0 < z < 2$, allowing us to fully probe the
dark energy domination era and the transition into matter domination. This
measurement is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM ($A_{\rm ISW} = 0.96 \pm 0.30$). We
study constraints on a particular class of dynamical dark energy models (where
the dark energy equation of state is different in matter and dark energy
domination), finding that unWISE-ISW improves constraints from type Ia
supernovae due to improved constraints on the time evolution of dark energy.
When combining with BAO measurements, we obtain the tightest constraints on
specific dynamical dark energy models. In the context of a phenomenological
model for freezing quintessence, the Mocker model, we constrain the dark energy
density within 10% at $z < 2$ using ISW, BAO and supernovae. Moreover, the ISW
measurement itself provides an important independent check when relaxing
assumptions about the theory of gravity, as it is sensitive to the
gravitational potential rather than the expansion history.

interpretation of heliospheric observations. There are several
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) heliospheric models that rely on
different strategies and assumptions. Until now only one paper has compared
global heliosphere models, but without magnetic field effects. We compare the
results of two different MHD models, the BU and Moscow models. Both models use
identical boundary conditions to compare how different numerical approaches and
physical assumptions contribute to the heliospheric solution. Based on the
different numerical treatments of discontinuities, the BU model allows for the
presence of magnetic reconnection, while the Moscow model does not. Both models
predict collimation of the solar outflow in the heliosheath by the solar
magnetic field and produce a split-tail where the solar magnetic field confines
the charged solar particles into distinct north and south columns that become
lobes. In the BU model, the ISM flows between the two lobes at large distances
due to MHD instabilities and reconnection. Reconnection in the BU model at the
port flank affects the draping of the interstellar magnetic field in the
immediate vicinity of the heliopause. Different draping in the models cause
different ISM pressures, yielding different heliosheath thicknesses and
boundary locations, with the largest effects at high latitudes. The BU model
heliosheath is 15% thinner and the heliopause is 7% more inwards at the north
pole relative to the Moscow model. These differences in the two plasma
solutions may manifest themselves in energetic neutral atom measurements of the

planes of the inner and outer disc, will excite a slowly evolving bending wave
in the outer disc. The torque from the stiff inner disc drives a retrograde,
leading-spiral bending wave that grows in amplitude as it propagates outward
over a period of several Gyr. This behaviour creates warps that obey the rules
established from observations, and operates no matter what the original cause
of the misalignment between the inner and outer disc. The part of the disc left
behind by the outwardly propagating wave is brought into alignment with the
inner disc. Here we confirm that mild warps in simulations of disc galaxies can
be excited by shot noise in the halo, as was recently reported. We show that
the quadrupole component of the noise creates disc distortions most
effectively. Bending waves caused by shot noise in carefully constructed
equilibrium simulations of isolated galaxies are far too mild to be observable,
but perturbations from halo substructure and galaxy assembly must excite larger
amplitude bending waves in real galaxies.

routines to convert the distributions of plasma and H atoms into ENA maps. Here
we investigate how two different kinetic-MHD models of the heliosphere (the BU
and Moscow models) manifest in modeled ENA maps using the same prescription and
how they compare with Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) observations. Both
MHD models treat the solar wind as a single-ion plasma for protons, which
include thermal solar wind ions, pick-up ions (PUIs), and electrons. Our ENA
prescription partitions the plasma into three distinct ion populations (thermal
solar wind, PUIs transmitted and ones energized at the termination shock) and
models the populations with Maxwellian distributions. Both kinetic-MHD
heliospheric models produce a heliotail with heliosheath plasma organized by
the solar magnetic field into two distinct north and south columns that become
lobes of high mass flux flowing down the heliotail, though in the BU model the
ISM flows between the two lobes at distances in the heliotail larger than 300
AU. While our prescription produces similar ENA maps for the two different
plasma and H atom solutions at the IBEX-Hi energy range (0.5 - 6 keV), the
modeled ENA maps require a scaling factor of ~2 to be in agreement with the
data. This problem is present in other ENA models with the Maxwellian
approximation of multiple ion species and indicates that a higher neutral
density or some acceleration of PUIs in the heliosheath is required.

from depleted stocks caused by overfishing, illegal encroachments by fishermen

finds that nations in congested environments are incentivized to issue
excessive quotas, which in turn tacitly encourages illegal fishing and extracts
illegal rent from another's legal waters. This behavior couldn't persist in the

poor MCS. A bargaining problem is analyzed to complement the noncooperative

co-occurrences and analyze the behavior of potential candidate treatments. We
used a data set associated with a COVID-19 drug re-purposing study from Oak

treatments, including drugs and approved compounds, which had been analyzed and
ranked according to their potential for blocking the ability of the SARS-COV-2

that their frequency and contextual dynamics could be evaluated. We identified
three classes of behaviors: those where frequency and contextual shifts were
small and positively correlated; those where there was no correlation between
frequency and contextual changes; and those where there was a negative
correlation between frequency and contextual shift. We speculate that the
latter two patterns are indicative that a target candidate therapeutics is
undergoing active evaluation. The patterns we detected demonstrate the

heads so that they supported both tasks with minimal addition to computer
run-time. Furthermore, based on the outcome of the system, motion metrics were
calculated. These metrics included traditional metrics such as time and path
length as well as new metrics assessing the technique participants use for
holding the tools. The dual-task network performance was similar to that of two
networks, while computational load was only slightly bigger than one network.
In addition, the motion metrics showed significant differences between experts

surgery, it is not an integral component of open surgery. Thus, new algorithms,
focusing on the unique challenges open surgery videos present, are required. In
this study, a dual-task network was developed to solve both a localization task

multi-task network, which may be useful for images with multiple layers and for

control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their
shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \mapsto y$
by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation
$\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are
closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit
their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time,
explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale
adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time
memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that
endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a
simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series
benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world
healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification

for solving NP-hard routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem

solve complex problems, DRL frameworks still struggle to compete with
state-of-the-art heuristics showing a substantial performance gap. This paper
proposes a novel hierarchical problem-solving strategy, termed learning
collaborative policies (LCP), which can effectively find the near-optimum
solution using two iterative DRL policies: the seeder and reviser. The seeder
generates as diversified candidate solutions as possible (seeds) while being
dedicated to exploring over the full combinatorial action space (i.e., sequence
of assignment action). To this end, we train the seeder's policy using a simple
yet effective entropy regularization reward to encourage the seeder to find
diverse solutions. On the other hand, the reviser modifies each candidate
solution generated by the seeder; it partitions the full trajectory into
sub-tours and simultaneously revises each sub-tour to minimize its traveling
distance. Thus, the reviser is trained to improve the candidate solution's
quality, focusing on the reduced solution space (which is beneficial for
exploitation). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed two-policies
collaboration scheme improves over single-policy DRL framework on various
NP-hard routing problems, including TSP, prize collecting TSP (PCTSP), and
capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP).

at the ISOLDE facility at CERN, where indium isotopes were selectively

Population of neutron-unbound states decaying via $\gamma$ rays was identified
in the two daughter nuclei of $^{134}$In, $^{134}$Sn and $^{133}$Sn, at
excitation energies exceeding the neutron separation energy by 1 MeV. The
$\beta$-delayed one- and two-neutron emission branching ratios of $^{134}$In

one-neutron decay was observed to be dominant $\beta$-decay branch of

the $\beta$ decay of $^{135}$In are reported for the first time, including

ordering is strongest and best characterized. Here we report a combined
resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS) and neutron scattering study of charge
and spin density waves in isotopically enriched La$_{1.8-x}$ Eu$_{0.2}$
Sr$_{x}$ CuO$_{4}$ over a range of doping $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.20$. For all
dopings studied by RSXS, we find that the CDW amplitude is approximately
temperature-independent and develops well above experimentally accessible
temperatures. Surprisingly, the CDW ordering wavevector shows a non-monotonic
temperature dependence, with a sudden change occurring at temperatures near the
SDW onset temperature. We describe this behavior with a Landau-Ginzburg theory
for an incommensurate CDW in a metallic system with a finite charge
compressibility and CDW-SDW coupling. Our Landau-Ginzburg analysis suggests
that the ordering wavevector at high temperatures decreases with increased
doping. This behavior is opposite to the trend at low temperatures and highly
reminiscent of the doping dependence seen in YBa$_2$ Cu$_3$ O$_{6+\delta}$ ,
suggesting a common origin of the CDW in hole-doped cuprate superconductors.

translation of reality processes into an abstract mechanism that has similar
structure and parallel events of the external processes. Although various
modeling approaches exist, including UML (Unified Modeling Language) in
software engineering and its dialect, SysML (System Modeling Language), in
systems engineering, several difficulties arise in such models, including the
problem of model multiplicity that is related to the lack an integrated view of
structure and behavior. This paper generalizes conceptual modeling to be
applied in organizations at large. According to authorities, the so-called
organization theory portrays organizations as machine-like systems. As a
machine, an organization coordinates its parts to transform inputs into
outputs. Therefore, we synthesize the notion of an organization as a machine
and apply a new modeling methodology called thinging machine (TM) to real
engineering operations. The results show the viability of the TM methodology

  Model for Disease Progression Modeling",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Model (CT-HMM) is an attractive approach to
modeling disease progression due to its ability to describe noisy observations
arriving irregularly in time. However, the lack of an efficient parameter
learning algorithm for CT-HMM restricts its use to very small models or
requires unrealistic constraints on the state transitions. In this paper, we
present the first complete characterization of efficient EM-based learning
methods for CT-HMM models, as well as the first solution to decoding the
optimal state transition sequence and the corresponding state dwelling time. We
show that EM-based learning consists of two challenges: the estimation of
posterior state probabilities and the computation of end-state conditioned
statistics. We solve the first challenge by reformulating the estimation
problem as an equivalent discrete time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov model. The
second challenge is addressed by adapting three distinct approaches from the
continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) literature to the CT-HMM domain.
Additionally, we further improve the efficiency of the most efficient method by
a factor of the number of states. Then, for decoding, we incorporate a
state-of-the-art method from the (CTMC) literature, and extend the end-state
conditioned optimal state sequence decoding to the CT-HMM case with the
computation of the expected state dwelling time. We demonstrate the use of
CT-HMMs with more than 100 states to visualize and predict disease progression
using a glaucoma dataset and an Alzheimer's disease dataset, and to decode and
visualize the most probable state transition trajectory for individuals on the

small collection of basic tensor algebra operators. This decomposition enables
TOD to accelerate OD computations by leveraging recent advances in deep
learning infrastructure in both hardware and software. Moreover, to deploy
memory-intensive OD applications on modern GPUs with limited on-device memory,
we introduce two key techniques. First, provable quantization speeds up OD
computations and reduces its memory footprint by automatically performing
specific floating-point operations in lower precision while provably
guaranteeing no accuracy loss. Second, to exploit the aggregated compute
resources and memory capacity of multiple GPUs, we introduce automatic
batching, which decomposes OD computations into small batches for both
sequential execution on a single GPU and parallel execution on multiple GPUs.
  TOD supports a diverse set of OD algorithms. Extensive evaluation on 11 real
and 3 synthetic OD datasets shows that TOD is on average 10.9x faster than the
leading CPU-based OD system PyOD (with a maximum speedup of 38.9x), and can
handle much larger datasets than existing GPU-based OD systems. In addition,
TOD allows easy integration of new OD operators, enabling fast prototyping of

as it is one of the major causes of cancer mortality worldwide. In this regard,
breast ultrasonography images are frequently utilized by doctors to diagnose
breast cancer at an early stage. However, the complex artifacts and heavily
noised breast ultrasonography images make diagnosis a great challenge.
Furthermore, the ever-increasing number of patients being screened for breast
cancer necessitates the use of automated end-to-end technology for highly
accurate diagnosis at a low cost and in a short time. In this concern, to
develop an end-to-end integrated pipeline for breast ultrasonography image
classification, we conducted an exhaustive analysis of image preprocessing
methods such as K Means++ and SLIC, as well as four transfer learning models
such as VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, and ResNet50. With a Dice-coefficient score
of 63.4 in the segmentation stage and accuracy and an F1-Score (Benign) of
73.72 percent and 78.92 percent in the classification stage, the combination of
SLIC, UNET, and VGG16 outperformed all other integrated combinations. Finally,
we have proposed an end to end integrated automated pipelining framework which
includes preprocessing with SLIC to capture super-pixel features from the
complex artifact of ultrasonography images, complementing semantic segmentation
with modified U-Net, leading to breast tumor classification using a transfer
learning approach with a pre-trained VGG16 and a densely connected neural
network. The proposed automated pipeline can be effectively implemented to
assist medical practitioners in making more accurate and timely diagnoses of
breast cancer.

the inherent subjectivity of neighborhoods creates methodological challenges in

respondents to draw their neighborhoods on a map. We also propose a statistical
model to analyze how the characteristics of respondents and local areas
determine subjective neighborhoods. We conduct two surveys: collecting
subjective neighborhoods from voters in Miami, New York City, and Phoenix, and
asking New York City residents to draw a community of interest for inclusion in
their city council district. Our analysis shows that, holding other factors
constant, White respondents include census blocks with more White residents in
their neighborhoods. Similarly, Democrats and Republicans are more likely to
include co-partisan areas. In addition, our model provides more accurate
out-of-sample predictions than standard neighborhood measures.

selection bias is linked to both (i) which players receive opportunity to
perform in sport, and (ii) at which ages we observe these players perform. This

the probability of a connection between two nodes depends on the distance

the graph Laplacian in the limit as the number of nodes tends to infinity by a
nonlocal operator -- the graphon Laplacian. For the ring networks considered
here, we employ center manifold theory to characterize Turing bifurcations in
the continuum limit in a manner similar to the classical partial differential

derive estimates that relate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the finite
graph Laplacian to those of the graphon Laplacian. We are then able to show
that, for a sufficiently large realization of the network, with high
probability the bifurcations that occur in the finite graph are well
approximated by those in the graphon limit. The number of nodes required
depends on the spectral gap between the critical eigenvalue and the remaining
ones, with the smaller this gap the more nodes that are required to guarantee
that the graphon and graph bifurcations are similar. We demonstrate that if
this condition is not satisfied then the bifurcations that occur in the finite

diagnostic predictions. We select publicly available deep learning models
relating to various health conditions (e.g., skin cancer, lung sound, and
Parkinson's disease) using various input data types (e.g., image, audio, and

out-of-distribution data with high accuracy for the health models that operate
on different modalities. We then translate the out-of-distribution score into a
human interpretable CONFIDENCE SCORE to investigate its effect on the users'

Given the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning, we argue for a

computational meta-imaging from the earliest frequency-diverse compressive
systems to modern programmable intelligent meta-imagers. We introduce a clear
taxonomy in terms of the flow of task-relevant information that has direct
links to information theory: compressive meta-imagers indiscriminately acquire
all scene information in a task-agnostic measurement process that aims at a
near-isometric embedding; intelligent meta-imagers highlight task-relevant
information in a task-aware measurement process that is purposefully
non-isometric. The measurement process of intelligent meta-imagers is thus
simultaneously an analog wave processor that implements a first task-specific
inference step ""over-the-air"". We provide explicit design tutorials for the
integration of programmable meta-atoms as trainable physical weights into an
intelligent end-to-end sensing pipeline. This merging of the physical world of
metamaterial engineering and the digital world of AI enables the remarkable
latency gains of intelligent meta-imagers. We further outline emerging
opportunities for cognitive meta-imagers with reverberation-enhanced resolution

vibrant field of metamaterial wave processors to reach the holy grail of

  Variable Speed Limit and Boundary Flow Control",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The combination of boundary flow control and variable speed limit (VSL) is a
widely used strategy for highway corridors to maintain safety and throughput
when the capacity downstream is dropped. However, most proposed models assume
fixed and known demand, which is not always true in reality. Following a
recently proposed boundary flow and VSL control model that is based on the
Lax-Hopf solution to the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model, this paper
proposes a two-stage stochastic model to tackle the uncertainties in demand.
Our model assumes the demand follows a discrete distribution and the speed
limit can be chosen from a pre-defined set with reasonable values. The first
stage tries to find the optimal inflow control, which is the here-and-now
decision, by considering the speed limit control downstream, and the second
stage is to determine the optimal speed limit after observing the real demand.
Those controls are coordinated by using a rolling horizon scheme. The case
study shows the proposed model outperforms three deterministic models, which
use the minimum, mean value and maximum of the demand as model input, under
various scenarios. With ensuring the maximum of throughput, the proposed model
is demonstrated to be able to reduce the fluctuation of entry flow without a
significant increase in blocked vehicles.

this deficiency, researchers are actively developing new training strategies,
which encourage models that are robust to small input perturbations. Several
successful robust training methods have been proposed. However, many of them
rely on strong adversaries, which can be prohibitively expensive to generate
when the input dimension is high and the model structure is complicated. We
adopt a new perspective on robustness and propose a novel training algorithm
that allows a more effective use of adversaries. Our method improves the model
robustness at each local ball centered around an adversary and then, by
combining these local balls through a global term, achieves overall robustness.
We demonstrate that, by maximizing the use of adversaries via focusing on local
balls, we achieve high robust accuracy with weak adversaries. Specifically, our
method reaches a similar robust accuracy level to the state of the art
approaches trained on strong adversaries on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. As a
result, the overall training time is reduced. Furthermore, when trained with
strong adversaries, our method matches with the current state of the art on
MNIST and outperforms them on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

While surrogate regret bounds have been developed for certain classes of loss

provide two general results. The first gives a linear surrogate regret bound
for any polyhedral (piecewise-linear and convex) surrogate, meaning that
surrogate generalization rates translate directly to target rates. The second

paper proposes a novel Memory-Economic Sparse Training (MEST) framework
targeting for accurate and fast execution on edge devices. The proposed MEST
framework consists of enhancements by Elastic Mutation (EM) and Soft Memory
Bound (&S) that ensure superior accuracy at high sparsity ratios. Different
from the existing works for sparse training, this current work reveals the
importance of sparsity schemes on the performance of sparse training in terms
of accuracy as well as training speed on real edge devices. On top of that, the
paper proposes to employ data efficiency for further acceleration of sparse
training. Our results suggest that unforgettable examples can be identified
in-situ even during the dynamic exploration of sparsity masks in the sparse
training process, and therefore can be removed for further training speedup on
edge devices. Comparing with state-of-the-art (SOTA) works on accuracy, our
MEST increases Top-1 accuracy significantly on ImageNet when using the same
unstructured sparsity scheme. Systematical evaluation on accuracy, training
speed, and memory footprint are conducted, where the proposed MEST framework
consistently outperforms representative SOTA works. A reviewer strongly against
our work based on his false assumptions and misunderstandings. On top of the
previous submission, we employ data efficiency for further acceleration of

that second-life batteries have a complex ultrasound response due to the

molecular jets have been observed from several protostars in the early Class\,0

no clear jet has been detected with SiO emission from isolated evolved Class\,I
protostellar systems. We report a prominent dense SiO jet from a Class\,I
source G205S3 (HOPS\,315: T$_{bol}$ $\sim$ 180 K, spectral index $\sim$ 0.417),

G205S3 is still in a high accretion phase, similar to that expected of Class\,0
objects. We compare G205S3 to a representative Class\,0 system G206W2
(HOPS\,399) and literature Class\,0/I sources to explore the possible
explanations behind the SiO emission seen at the later phase. We estimate a
high inclination angle ($\sim$ 40$^\circ$) for G205S3 from CO emission, which
may expose the infrared emission from the central core and mislead the spectral
classification. However, the compact 1.3\,mm continuum, C$^{18}$O emission,
location in the bolometric luminosity to sub-millimeter fluxes diagram, outflow
force ($\sim$ 3.26 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ M$_\odot$km s$^{-1}$/yr) are also
analogous to that of Class\,I systems. We thus consider G205S3 to be at the
very early phase of Class\,I, and in the late phase of ``high-accretion"". The
episodic ejection could be due to the presence of an unknown binary, a
planetary companion, or dense clumps, where the required mass for such high

along trajectories (e.g. rigid body motion). The distance estimation problem
will be correlatively sparse when the distance objective is separable.

  Systems, 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The goal of multi-task learning is to enable more efficient learning than
single task learning by sharing model structures for a diverse set of tasks. A
standard multi-task learning objective is to minimize the average loss across
all tasks. While straightforward, using this objective often results in much
worse final performance for each task than learning them independently. A major
challenge in optimizing a multi-task model is the conflicting gradients, where
gradients of different task objectives are not well aligned so that following
the average gradient direction can be detrimental to specific tasks'
performance. Previous work has proposed several heuristics to manipulate the
task gradients for mitigating this problem. But most of them lack convergence
guarantee and/or could converge to any Pareto-stationary point. In this paper,
we introduce Conflict-Averse Gradient descent (CAGrad) which minimizes the
average loss function, while leveraging the worst local improvement of
individual tasks to regularize the algorithm trajectory. CAGrad balances the
objectives automatically and still provably converges to a minimum over the
average loss. It includes the regular gradient descent (GD) and the multiple
gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) in the multi-objective optimization (MOO)
literature as special cases. On a series of challenging multi-task supervised
learning and reinforcement learning tasks, CAGrad achieves improved performance
over prior state-of-the-art multi-objective gradient manipulation methods.

compromises the reliability of a model. The problem has gained significant
attention due to its importance for safety deploying models in open-world

modeling all possible unknown distributions. To date, several research domains
tackle the problem of detecting unfamiliar samples, including anomaly
detection, novelty detection, one-class learning, open set recognition, and
out-of-distribution detection. Despite having similar and shared concepts,
out-of-distribution, open-set, and anomaly detection have been investigated
independently. Accordingly, these research avenues have not cross-pollinated,
creating research barriers. While some surveys intend to provide an overview of
these approaches, they seem to only focus on a specific domain without
examining the relationship between different domains. This survey aims to
provide a cross-domain and comprehensive review of numerous eminent works in
respective areas while identifying their commonalities. Researchers can benefit
from the overview of research advances in different fields and develop future
methodology synergistically. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, while
there are surveys in anomaly detection or one-class learning, there is no
comprehensive or up-to-date survey on out-of-distribution detection, which our
survey covers extensively. Finally, having a unified cross-domain perspective,
we discuss and shed light on future lines of research, intending to bring these

many research fields, such as planning, verification, and security. Mainstream
modern SAT solvers are based on the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)
algorithm. Recent work aimed to enhance CDCL SAT solvers by improving their
variable branching heuristics through predictions generated by Graph Neural
Networks(GNNs). However, so far this approach either has not made solving more
effective, or has required online access to substantial GPU resources. Aiming
to make GNN improvements practical, this paper proposes an approach called
NeuroComb, which builds on two insights: (1) predictions of important variables
and clauses can be combined with dynamic branching into a more effective hybrid
branching strategy, and (2) it is sufficient to query the neural model only
once for the predictions before the SAT solving starts. NeuroComb is
implemented as an enhancement to a classic CDCL solver called MiniSat and a
more recent CDCL solver called Glucose. As a result, it allowed MiniSat to
solve 11% and Glucose 5% more problems on the recent SATCOMP-2021 competition
problem set, with the computational resource requirement of only one GPU.
NeuroComb is therefore a both effective and practical approach to improving SAT
solving through machine learning.

studied. Prior work~\cite{veli19neural} has shown that to enable systematic
generalisation on graph algorithms it is critical to have access to the
intermediate steps of the program/algorithm. In many reasoning tasks, where
algorithmic-style reasoning is important, we only have access to the input and
output examples. Thus, inspired by the success of pre-training on similar tasks
or data in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision, we set out to
study how we can transfer algorithmic reasoning knowledge. Specifically, we
investigate how we can use algorithms for which we have access to the execution
trace to learn to solve similar tasks for which we do not. We investigate two
major classes of graph algorithms, parallel algorithms such as breadth-first
search and Bellman-Ford and sequential greedy algorithms such as Prim and
Dijkstra. Due to the fundamental differences between algorithmic reasoning
knowledge and feature extractors such as used in Computer Vision or NLP, we
hypothesise that standard transfer techniques will not be sufficient to achieve
systematic generalisation. To investigate this empirically we create a dataset
including 9 algorithms and 3 different graph types. We validate this
empirically and show how instead multi-task learning can be used to achieve the
transfer of algorithmic reasoning knowledge.

transfer a well-generalized meta-model learned from various meta-training
tasks. Existing meta-learning algorithms randomly sample meta-training tasks
with a uniform probability, under the assumption that tasks are of equal
importance. However, it is likely that tasks are detrimental with noise or
imbalanced given a limited number of meta-training tasks. To prevent the
meta-model from being corrupted by such detrimental tasks or dominated by tasks
in the majority, in this paper, we propose an adaptive task scheduler (ATS) for
the meta-training process. In ATS, for the first time, we design a neural
scheduler to decide which meta-training tasks to use next by predicting the
probability being sampled for each candidate task, and train the scheduler to
optimize the generalization capacity of the meta-model to unseen tasks. We
identify two meta-model-related factors as the input of the neural scheduler,
which characterize the difficulty of a candidate task to the meta-model.
Theoretically, we show that a scheduler taking the two factors into account
improves the meta-training loss and also the optimization landscape. Under the
setting of meta-learning with noise and limited budgets, ATS improves the
performance on both miniImageNet and a real-world drug discovery benchmark by
up to 13% and 18%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art task schedulers.

high-mass white dwarf. The optical pre-outburst detection of a 501.42s

oscillation of this magnitude has been detected in a classical nova prior to
outburst. We report X-ray outburst observations from {\it Swift} and {\it
Chandra} which uniquely show: (1) a very strong modulation of super-soft X-rays

variations and the possible presence of period variations of the order of
0.1-0.3s; and (3) rich grating spectra that vary with modulation phase and show
P Cygni-type emission lines with two dominant blue-shifted absorption

difference between the period found in the {\it Chandra} data and a reported

congestion and energy consumption by proposing an integrated bi-level framework
comprising of: a) a dynamic micro-scale traffic simulation suitable for
modelling current and hypothetical traffic and charging demand scenarios and b)
a queue model for capturing the impact of fast charging station use, informed
by traffic flows, travel distances, availability of charging infrastructure and
estimated vehicle battery state of charge. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first integrated analysis of potential traffic congestion
and energy infrastructure impacts linked to EV uptake, based on real traffic
flows and the placement and design of existing fast-charging infrastructure.
Results showcase that the integrated queue-energy-transport modelling framework
can predict correctly the limitations of the EV infrastructure as well as the
traffic congestion evolution. The modelling approach identifies concrete pain
points to be addressed in both traffic and energy management and planning. The

the final state using the MicroBooNE experiment and an investigation into the
excess of low-energy electromagnetic events observed by the MiniBooNE
collaboration. The measurement is performed in exclusive channels with
(1$e$N$p$0$\pi$) and without (1$e$0$p$0$\pi$) visible final-state protons using
6.86$\times 10^{20}$ protons on target of data collected from the Booster
Neutrino Beam at Fermilab. Events are reconstructed with the Pandora pattern
recognition toolkit and selected using additional topological information from
the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber. Using a goodness-of-fit
test the data are found to be consistent with the predicted number of events
with nominal flux and interaction models with a $p$-value of 0.098 in the two
channels combined. A model based on the low-energy excess observed in MiniBooNE
is introduced to quantify the strength of a possible $\nu_e$ excess. The
analysis suggests that if an excess is present, it is not consistent with a
simple scaling of the $\nu_e$ contribution to the flux. Combined, the
1$e$N$p$0$\pi$ and 1$e$0$p$0$\pi$ channels do not give a conclusive indication
about the tested model, but separately they both disfavor the low-energy excess
model at $>$90% CL. The observation in the most sensitive 1$e$N$p$0$\pi$
channel is below the prediction and consistent with no excess. In the less
sensitive 1$e$0$p$0$\pi$ channel the observation at low energy is above the
prediction, while overall there is agreement over the full energy spectrum.

efficient model reduction methodology to capture transient dynamics in a
transmission level electric power system. Such dynamics is normally modeled on
seconds-to-tens-of-seconds time scales by the so-called swing equations, which
are ordinary differential equations defined on a spatially discrete model of
the power grid. Following Seymlyen (1974) and Thorpe, Seyler, and Phadke
(1999), we suggest to map the swing equations onto a linear, inhomogeneous
Partial Differential Equation (PDE) of parabolic type in two space and one time
dimensions with time-independent coefficients and properly defined boundary
conditions. We illustrate our method on the synchronous transmission grid of
continental Europe. We show that, when properly coarse-grained, i.e., with the
PDE coefficients and source terms extracted from a spatial convolution
procedure of the respective discrete coefficients in the swing equations, the
resulting PDE reproduces faithfully and efficiently the original swing
dynamics. We finally discuss future extensions of this work, where the
presented PDE-based modeling will initialize a physics-informed machine
learning approach for real-time modeling, $n-1$ feasibility assessment and
transient stability analysis of power systems.

  Found within Randomly Initialized Networks","Accepted at NeurIPS 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, i.e., an imperceptible perturbation to the input can mislead DNNs
trained on clean images into making erroneous predictions. To tackle this,
adversarial training is currently the most effective defense method, by
augmenting the training set with adversarial samples generated on the fly.
Interestingly, we discover for the first time that there exist subnetworks with
inborn robustness, matching or surpassing the robust accuracy of the
adversarially trained networks with comparable model sizes, within randomly
initialized networks without any model training, indicating that adversarial
training on model weights is not indispensable towards adversarial robustness.
We name such subnetworks Robust Scratch Tickets (RSTs), which are also by
nature efficient. Distinct from the popular lottery ticket hypothesis, neither
the original dense networks nor the identified RSTs need to be trained. To
validate and understand this fascinating finding, we further conduct extensive
experiments to study the existence and properties of RSTs under different
models, datasets, sparsity patterns, and attacks, drawing insights regarding
the relationship between DNNs' robustness and their
initialization/overparameterization. Furthermore, we identify the poor
adversarial transferability between RSTs of different sparsity ratios drawn
from the same randomly initialized dense network, and propose a Random RST
Switch (R2S) technique, which randomly switches between different RSTs, as a
novel defense method built on top of RSTs. We believe our findings about RSTs
have opened up a new perspective to study model robustness and extend the
lottery ticket hypothesis.

topology has become a new paradigm in condensed matter physics. Realization of
topology as a generic property of materials has led to numerous predictions of
topological effects. Although most of the classical topological effects,
directly resulting from the presence of the spin-momentum-locked topological
surface states (TSS), were experimentally confirmed soon after the theoretical
prediction of TIs, many topological quantum effects remained elusive for a long
while. It turns out that native defects, particularly interfacial defects, have
been the main culprit behind this impasse. Even after quantum regime is
achieved for the bulk states, TSS still tends to remain in the classical regime
due to high density of interfacial defects, which frequently donate mobile
carriers due to the very nature of the topologically-protected surface states.
However, with several defect engineering schemes that suppress these effects, a
series of topological quantum effects have emerged including quantum anomalous
Hall effect, quantum Hall effect, quantized Faraday/Kerr rotations, topological
quantum phase transitions, axion insulating state, zeroth-Landau level state,
etc. Here, we review how these defect engineering schemes have allowed
topological surface states to pull out of the murky classical regime and reveal
their elusive quantum signatures, over the past decade.

both returns an estimate in $(\beta x^*,x^*]$ and enjoys an upper-bound $\lceil

mechanism employed in several root-searching methods is adapted here for the
purpose of performing inexact line searches, leading to a new class of inexact

is transposed into a very simple method that completes the same inexact line

kinematics of charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) events. The topology of such

deep-learning-based image identification, and event isolation using a boosted
decision-tree ensemble trained to recognize two-body scattering kinematics.
This analysis selects 25 $\nu_e$-candidate events in the reconstructed neutrino
energy range of 200--1200\,MeV, while $29.0 \pm 1.9_\text{(sys)} \pm
5.4_\text{(stat)}$ are predicted when using $\nu_\mu$ CCQE interactions as a

observation into a prediction for a $\nu_e$ signal in MicroBooNE. A $\Delta
\chi^2$ test statistic, based on the combined Neyman--Pearson $\chi^2$
formalism, is used to define frequentist confidence intervals for the LEE
signal strength. Using this technique, in the case of no LEE signal, we expect
this analysis to exclude a normalization factor of 0.75 (0.98) times the median
MiniBooNE LEE signal strength at 90\% ($2\sigma$) confidence level, while the
MicroBooNE data yield an exclusion of 0.25 (0.38) times the median MiniBooNE

  Learning-Based Bug Repair",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Training a deep learning model on source code has gained significant traction
recently. Since such models reason about vectors of numbers, source code needs
to be converted to a code representation before vectorization. Numerous
approaches have been proposed to represent source code, from sequences of
tokens to abstract syntax trees. However, there is no systematic study to
understand the effect of code representation on learning performance. Through a
controlled experiment, we examine the impact of various code representations on
model accuracy and usefulness in deep learning-based program repair. We train
21 different generative models that suggest fixes for name-based bugs,
including 14 different homogeneous code representations, four mixed
representations for the buggy and fixed code, and three different embeddings.
We assess if fix suggestions produced by the model in various code
representations are automatically patchable, meaning they can be transformed to
a valid code that is ready to be applied to the buggy code to fix it. We also
conduct a developer study to qualitatively evaluate the usefulness of inferred
fixes in different code representations. Our results highlight the importance
of code representation and its impact on learning and usefulness. Our findings
indicate that (1) while code abstractions help the learning process, they can
adversely impact the usefulness of inferred fixes from a developer's point of
view; this emphasizes the need to look at the patches generated from the
practitioner's perspective, which is often neglected in the literature, (2)
mixed representations can outperform homogeneous code representations, (3) bug
type can affect the effectiveness of different code representations; although
current techniques use a single code representation for all bug types, there is
no single best code representation applicable to all bug types.

  parameter inference for partially observed stochastic processes",,,"10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111543",,"stat.CO q-bio.MN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Models of stochastic processes are widely used in almost all fields of
science. Theory validation, parameter estimation, and prediction all require
model calibration and statistical inference using data. However, data are
almost always incomplete observations of reality. This leads to a great
challenge for statistical inference because the likelihood function will be
intractable for almost all partially observed stochastic processes. This
renders many statistical methods, especially within a Bayesian framework,
impossible to implement. Therefore, computationally expensive likelihood-free
approaches are applied that replace likelihood evaluations with realisations of
the model and observation process. For accurate inference, however,
likelihood-free techniques may require millions of expensive stochastic
simulations. To address this challenge, we develop a new method based on recent
advances in multilevel and multifidelity. Our approach combines the multilevel
Monte Carlo telescoping summation, applied to a sequence of approximate
Bayesian posterior targets, with a multifidelity rejection sampler to minimise
the number of computationally expensive exact simulations required for accurate
inference. We present the derivation of our new algorithm for likelihood-free
Bayesian inference, discuss practical implementation details, and demonstrate
substantial performance improvements. Using examples from systems biology, we
demonstrate improvements of more than two orders of magnitude over standard
rejection sampling techniques. Our approach is generally applicable to
accelerate other sampling schemes, such as sequential Monte Carlo, to enable
feasible Bayesian analysis for realistic practical applications in physics,
chemistry, biology, epidemiology, ecology and economics.

throughout the universe, gravitational influences over the life of the universe
have resulted in mass clustered on a range of scales. Hence we expect that, in
our inhomogeneous universe, the view of an observer will be influenced by the
location and local environment. Here we analyse the one-point probability
distribution functions and angular power spectra of weak-lensing (WL)
convergence and magnification numerically to investigate the influence of our
local environment on WL statistics in relativistic $N$-body simulations. To
achieve this, we numerically solve the null geodesic equations which describe
the propagation of light bundles backwards in time from today, and develop a
ray-tracing algorithm, and from these calculate various WL properties. Our
findings demonstrate how cosmological observations of large-scale structure
through WL can be impacted by the locality of the observer. We also calculate
the constraints on the cosmological parameters as a function of redshift from
the theoretical and numerical study of the angular power spectrum of WL
convergence. This study concludes the minimal redshift for the constraint on
the parameter $\Omega_m$ ($H_0$) is $z \sim 0.2$ $(z \sim 0.6 )$ beyond which
the local environment's effect is negligible and the data from WL surveys are
more meaningful above that redshift. The outcomes of this study will have
direct consequences for future surveys, where percent-level-precision is

neuromorphic chips. To harness these computational benefits, SNN need to be
trained by learning algorithms that adhere to brain-inspired neuromorphic
principles, namely event-based, local, and online computations. Yet, the
state-of-the-art SNN training algorithms are based on backprop that does not
follow the above principles. Due to its limited biological plausibility, the
application of backprop to SNN requires non-local feedback pathways for
transmitting continuous-valued errors, and relies on gradients from future
timesteps. The introduction of biologically plausible modifications to backprop
has helped overcome several of its limitations, but limits the degree to which
backprop is approximated, which hinders its performance. We propose a
biologically plausible gradient-based learning algorithm for SNN that is
functionally equivalent to backprop, while adhering to all three neuromorphic
principles. We introduced multi-compartment spiking neurons with local
eligibility traces to compute the gradients required for learning, and a
periodic ""sleep"" phase to further improve the approximation to backprop during
which a local Hebbian rule aligns the feedback and feedforward weights. Our
method achieved the same level of performance as backprop with multi-layer
fully connected SNN on MNIST (98.13%) and the event-based N-MNIST (97.59%)
datasets. We deployed our learning algorithm on Intel's Loihi to train a
1-hidden-layer network for MNIST, and obtained 93.32% test accuracy while
consuming 400 times less energy per training sample than BioGrad on GPU. Our
work shows that optimal learning is feasible in neuromorphic computing, and
further pursuing its biological plausibility can better capture the benefits of
this emerging computing paradigm.

or are the strong high-excitation oxygen lines in the WO-type stars an
indication of higher temperatures. This study will act as a baseline for
answering the question of where WO-type stars fall in WR evolution. Each star's
spectrum, extending from 1100~\AA\ to 25000~\AA, was modeled using \cmfgen\ to
determine the star's physical properties such as luminosity, mass-loss rate,
and chemical abundances. The oxygen abundance is a key evolutionary diagnostic,
and with higher resolution data and an improved stellar atmosphere code, we
found the oxygen abundance to be up to a factor of 5 lower than previous
studies. The second evolutionary question revolves around the formation of WR
stars: Do they evolve by themselves or is a close companion star necessary for
their formation? Using our derived physical parameters, we compared our results
to the Geneva single-star evolutionary models and the BPASS binary evolutionary
models. We found that both the Geneva solar metallicity models and BPASS LMC
metallicity models are in agreement with the four WC-type stars, while the
Geneva LMC metallicity models are not. Therefore, these four WC4 stars could
have been formed either via binary or single-star evolution.

even in high-dimensional continuous state-action spaces. Bisimulation metrics
offer one solution to this representation learning problem, by collapsing
functionally similar states together in representation space, which promotes
invariance to noise and distractors. In this work, we generalize value function
approximation bounds for on-policy bisimulation metrics to non-optimal policies

embedding pathologies that may occur in practical use. In particular, we find
that these issues stem from an underconstrained dynamics model and an unstable

sparse rewards. Further, we propose a set of practical remedies: (i) a norm
constraint on the representation space, and (ii) an extension of prior

provide evidence that the resulting method is not only more robust to sparse

topological insulator, with helical conducting edge modes surrounding a bulk
state that becomes insulating at low temperatures. Here we present evidence
that the bulk state has a very unusual nature, containing electrons and holes
bound by Coulomb attraction (excitons) that spontaneously form in thermal
equilibrium. On cooling from room temperature to 100 K the conductivity
develops a V-shaped dependence on electrostatic doping, while the chemical
potential develops a ~43 meV step at the neutral point. These features are much
sharper than is possible in an independent-electron picture, but they can be
largely accounted for by positing that some of the electrons and holes are
paired in equilibrium. Our calculations from first principles show that the
exciton binding energy is larger than 100 meV and the radius as small as 4 nm,
explaining their formation at high temperature and doping levels. Below 100 K
more strongly insulating behavior is seen, suggesting that a charge-ordered
state forms. The observed absence of charge density waves in this state appears
surprising within an excitonic insulator picture, but we show that it can be
explained by the symmetries of the exciton wave function. Monolayer WTe2
therefore presents an exceptional combination of topological properties and
strong correlations over a wide temperature range.

dimensions have to be constrained by user-defined thresholds; second, elements

objective cost function that automatically drives the co-clustering process,
avoiding the need for constraining dimensions. We evaluate the proposed

to which the established features of this regularisation scheme survive in HEFT
is examined. In a single-channel $\pi N$ analysis, fits to experimental phase
shifts withstand large variations in the regularisation parameter, $\Lambda$,
providing an opportunity to explore the sensitivity of the finite-volume
spectrum and state composition on the regulator. While the L\""uscher formalism
ensures the eigenvalues are insensitive to $\Lambda$ variation in the
single-channel case, the eigenstate composition varies with $\Lambda$; the
admission of short distance interactions diminishes single-particle
contributions to the states. In the two-channel $\pi N$, $\pi \Delta$ analysis,
$\Lambda$ is restricted to a small range by the experimental data. Here the
inelasticity is particularly sensitive to variations in $\Lambda$ and its
associated parameter set. This sensitivity is also manifest in the
finite-volume spectrum for states near the opening of the $\pi \Delta$
scattering channel. Finally, HEFT has the unique ability to describe the
quark-mass dependence of the finite-volume eigenstates. The robust nature of
this capability is presented and used to confront current state-of-the-art
lattice QCD calculations.

Kinematics-based models estimating these metrics suffer from significant
different distributions of both kinematics and the injury metrics across head

the injury metrics. We have previously shown the kinematic features vary
largely across head impact types, resulting in different patterns of brain
deformation. This study analyzes the spatial distribution of brain deformation
and applies principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the representative
patterns of injury metrics (maximum principal strain (MPS), MPS rate (MPSR) and
MPSXMPSR) in four impact types (simulation, football, mixed martial arts and
car crashes). We apply PCA to decompose the patterns of the injury metrics for
all impacts in each impact type, and investigate the distributions among brain
regions using the first principal component (PC1). Furthermore, we developed a
deep learning head model (DLHM) to predict PC1 and then inverse-transform to
predict for all brain elements. PC1 explained >80% variance on the datasets.
Based on PC1 coefficients, the corpus callosum and midbrain exhibit high
variance on all datasets. We found MPSXMPSR the most sensitive metric on which
the top 5% of severe impacts further deviates from the mean and there is a
higher variance among the severe impacts. Finally, the DLHM reached mean
absolute errors of <0.018 for MPS, <3.7 (1/s) for MPSR and <1.1 (1/s) for
MPSXMPSR, much smaller than the injury thresholds. The brain injury metric in a
dataset can be decomposed into mean components and PC1 with high explained
variance. The brain dynamics decomposition enables better interpretation of the
patterns in brain injury metrics and the sensitivity of brain injury metrics
across impact types. The decomposition also reduces the dimensionality of DLHM.

introduce a two-stage approach: (a) we extract semantic objects from images by
utilizing discrete codes from a vector-quantized variational autoencoder, and
(b) we randomly drop the units that share the same discrete code together,
i.e., masking out semantic objects. Our experiments demonstrate that OREO
significantly improves the performance of behavioral cloning, outperforming
various other regularization and causality-based methods on a variety of Atari

present a method for computing the optimal value of $R_m$ based on the

(i) Single-Rm-ELM, in which a single $R_m$ is used for generating the random

$R_m$ constants are involved with each used for generating the random

particular, here we compute all the differential operators involving the output
fields of the last hidden layer by a forward-mode auto-differentiation, as
opposed to the reverse-mode auto-differentiation in a previous work. These
improvements significantly reduce the network training time and enhance the ELM
performance. We systematically compare the computational performance of the

classical second-order FEM and the high-order FEM with Lagrange elements of
higher degrees, for solving a number of linear and nonlinear PDEs. It is shown

eventually modeled as the corresponding multiobjective optimization problems

Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) has been
regarded as a significantly promising approach for solving MOPs. Recent studies
have shown that MOEA/D with uniform weight vectors is well-suited to MOPs with
regular Pareto optimal fronts, but its performance in terms of diversity
usually deteriorates when solving MOPs with irregular Pareto optimal fronts. In
this way, the solution set obtained by the algorithm can not provide more
reasonable choices for decision makers. In order to efficiently overcome this
drawback, we propose an improved MOEA/D algorithm by virtue of the well-known
Pascoletti-Serafini scalarization method and a new strategy of multi-reference
points. Specifically, this strategy consists of the setting and adaptation of
reference points generated by the techniques of equidistant partition and
projection. For performance assessment, the proposed algorithm is compared with
existing four state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms on
benchmark test problems with various types of Pareto optimal fronts. According
to the experimental results, the proposed algorithm exhibits better diversity
performance than that of the other compared algorithms. Finally, our algorithm
is applied to two real-world MOPs in engineering optimization successfully.

challenge given the computational limits of the mobile environment. Many
studies leverage knowledge distillation to boost predictive performance by
transferring the knowledge from large models to on-device models. However, most
lack a mechanism to distill the essence of the temporal information, which is
crucial to audio classification tasks, or similar architecture is often
required. In this paper, we propose a new knowledge distillation method
designed to incorporate the temporal knowledge embedded in attention weights of
large transformer-based models into on-device models. Our distillation method
is applicable to various types of architectures, including the
non-attention-based architectures such as CNNs or RNNs, while retaining the
original network architecture during inference. Through extensive experiments
on both an audio event detection dataset and a noisy keyword spotting dataset,
we show that our proposed method improves the predictive performance across
diverse on-device architectures.

new theories of light to be derived but it has also been used in interferometry
for the measurement of small displacements, refractive index changes and
surface irregularities. In a two-beam interferometer, variations in the
interference fringes are used as a diagnostic for anything that causes the
optical path difference (OPD) to change; therefore, for a specified OPD,
greater variation in the fringes indicates better measurement sensitivity.
Here, we introduce and experimentally validate an interesting optical
interference phenomenon that uses photons with a structured frequency-angular
spectrum, which are generated from a spontaneous parametric down-conversion
process in a nonlinear crystal. This interference phenomenon is manifested as
interference fringes that vary much more rapidly with increasing OPD than the
corresponding fringes for equal-inclination interference; the phenomenon is
parameterised using an equivalent wavelength, which under our experimental
conditions is 29.38 nm or about 1/27 of the real wavelength. This phenomenon
not only enriches the knowledge with regard to optical interference but also
offers promise for applications in interferometry.

high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 5$) Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) are high. However,
possible observational bias in $T_\mathrm{d}$ is yet to be understood. Thus, we
perform a simple test using random realizations of LBGs with various stellar
masses, dust temperatures, and dust-to-stellar mass ratios, and examine how the
sample detected by ALMA is biased in terms of $T_\mathrm{d}$. We show that ALMA
tends to miss high-$T_\mathrm{d}$ objects even at total dust luminosity. LBGs
are, however, basically selected by the stellar UV luminosity. The
dust-temperature bias in a UV-selected sample is complicated because of the
competing effects between high $T_\mathrm{d}$ and low dust abundance. For ALMA
Band 6, there is no tendency of high-$T_\mathrm{d}$ LBGs being more easily
detected in our experiment. Thus, we suggest that the observed trend of high
$T_\mathrm{d}$ in $z\gtrsim 5$ LBGs is real. We also propose that the 450
$\mu$m band is useful in further clarifying the dust temperatures. To overcome
the current shallowness of 450 $\mu$m observations, we examine a future
Antarctic 30-m class telescope with a suitable atmospheric condition for
wavelengths $\lesssim 450~\mu$m, where the detection is not confusion-limited.
We find that, with this telescope, an $L_\mathrm{IR}$-selected sample with
$\log(L_\mathrm{IR}/\mathrm{L}_{\odot})>11$ is constructed for $z\gtrsim 5$,
and detection in the intermediate-$M_\star$ (stellar mass) range [$9<\log

potential in computer vision and graphics applications. A crucial step is to
manipulate sequential future motion while retaining the appearance

trained a separate model specifically for each target person, which is not

to learn a single model to parsimoniously transfer motion from a source video
to any target person given only one image of the person, named as Collaborative
Parsing-Flow Network (CPF-Net). The paucity of information regarding the target
person makes the task particularly challenging to faithfully preserve the
appearance in varying designated poses. To address this issue, CPF-Net
integrates the structured human parsing and appearance flow to guide the
realistic foreground synthesis which is merged into the background by a
spatio-temporal fusion module. In particular, CPF-Net decouples the problem
into stages of human parsing sequence generation, foreground sequence
generation and final video generation. The human parsing generation stage
captures both the pose and the body structure of the target. The appearance
flow is beneficial to keep details in synthesized frames. The integration of
human parsing and appearance flow effectively guides the generation of video
frames with realistic appearance. Finally, the dedicated designed fusion
network ensure the temporal coherence. We further collect a large set of human

many are supported largely empirically. Moreover, combining such approaches in
a piecemeal manner can result in ad hoc methods, and the limited theoretical
results supporting each individual contribution may no longer hold. Toward
addressing these issues in a principled way, this paper proposes a cohesive
robust framework for center-based clustering under a general class of
dissimilarity measures. In particular, we present a rigorous theoretical
treatment within a Median-of-Means (MoM) estimation framework, showing that it
subsumes several popular $k$-means variants. In addition to unifying existing
methods, we derive uniform concentration bounds that complete their analyses,

Importantly, we neither require any assumptions on the distribution of the

computation and memory cost of deep ensembles limits their practicability.
While some recent works propose to distill an ensemble model into a single
model to reduce such costs, there is still a performance gap between the
ensemble and distilled models. We propose a simple approach for reducing this
gap, i.e., making the distilled performance close to the full ensemble. Our key
assumption is that a distilled model should absorb as much function diversity
inside the ensemble as possible. We first empirically show that the typical
distillation procedure does not effectively transfer such diversity, especially
for complex models that achieve near-zero training error. To fix this, we
propose a perturbation strategy for distillation that reveals diversity by
seeking inputs for which ensemble member outputs disagree. We empirically show
that a model distilled with such perturbed samples indeed exhibits enhanced
diversity, leading to improved performance.

probe to monitor dense and large objects. Muons are the most abundant cosmic
radiation on Earth, however, their flux at sea level is approximately 10,000

muon flux depends on not only various natural conditions (e.g., zenith angle,

detectors. Since the low muon flux typically results in long measurement times,
an accurate estimation of measurable muon counts is important for muon
applications. Here we propose a simple and versatile semi-empirical model to
improve the accuracy in muon flux estimation at all zenith angles by
incorporating the geometric parameters of detectors, and we name this the
Effective Solid Angle model. To demonstrate the functionality, our model is

a physical treatment of BH mergers. The BH population is broadly consistent
with empirical constraints on the BH mass function, the bright end of the

modules with all of their functionality, even if only a fraction is needed,
which causes an undue increase in code size. Eliminating this unused
functionality from distributions is desirable, but the sound analysis required
to find unused code is difficult due to JavaScript's extreme dynamicity.
  We present a fully automatic technique that identifies unused code by
constructing static or dynamic call graphs from the application's tests, and
replacing code deemed unreachable with either file- or function-level stubs. If
a stub is called, it will fetch and execute the original code on-demand, thus
relaxing the requirement that the call graph be sound. The technique also
provides an optional guarded execution mode to guard application against
injection vulnerabilities in untested code that resulted from stub expansion.
  This technique is implemented in an open source tool called Stubbifier, which

application size by 56% on average while incurring only minor performance

capable of preventing several known injection vulnerabilities that are
manifested in stubbed-out code. Finally, Stubbifier can work alongside

atomic inversion and the entanglement dynamics of atom-field interaction for
both the radiation fields are investigated and compared with each other. We
observe that depending on the state of the field, squeezing has very different
effects on coherent photons. Mild squeezing on the coherent photons localizes
the PCD for PSCS; however, for MSCS there is no such localization observed -
instead squeezing manifests for MSCS as oscillations in the PCD. The effects of
squeezing on the atomic inversion and the entanglement dynamics for PSCS are
very different as compared with the corresponding quantities associated with
MSCS; in fact, they are contrasting. It is well known in the literature that
for PSCS, increasing the squeezing increases the well-known ringing revivals in
the atomic inversion, and also increases irregularity in the entanglement
dynamics. However, increasing the squeezing in MSCS very significantly alters
the collapse-revival pattern in the atomic inversion and the entanglement

considered for active platform control: a low-bandwidth actuator that uses
variable floater ballast to bring a heeling platform to a steady-state upright

substructure geometry to actively reject transient platform motion. Each

They can be viewed as general solutions for representing KGs. However, existing

the inductive relation prediction task. They can not handle other out-of-KG

propose a model MorsE, which does not learn embeddings for entities but learns
transferable meta-knowledge that can be used to produce entity embeddings. Such
meta-knowledge is modeled by entity-independent modules and learned by
meta-learning. Experimental results show that our model significantly

associated quantum linear passive system is proposed, whose canonical form
reveals typical features of the Tavis-Cummings model, including $\sqrt{N}$-

are used to study the excitation properties of the Tavis-Cummings model in the

assignment $\sigma:E(G) \rightarrow \{+,-\}$. The notion of homomorphisms of
signed graphs is a relatively new development which allows to strengthen the
connection between the theories of minors and colorings of graphs. Following
this thread of thoughts, we investigate this connection through the notion of
Extended Double Covers of signed graphs, which was recently introduced by
Naserasr, Sopena and Zaslavsky. More precisely, we say that a signed graph $(B,
\pi)$ is planar-complete if any planar signed graph $(G, \sigma)$ which
verifies the conditions of a basic no-homomorphism lemma with respect to
$(B,\pi)$ admits a homomorphism to $(B, \pi)$. Our conjecture then is that: if
$(B, \pi)$ is a connected signed graph with no positive odd closed walk which
is planar-complete, then its Extended Double Cover ${\rm EDC}(B,\pi)$ is also
planar-complete. We observe that this conjecture largely extends the Four-Color
Theorem and is strongly connected to a number of conjectures in extension of
this famous theorem.
  A given (signed) graph $(B,\pi)$ \emph{bounds} a class of (signed) graphs if
every (signed) graph in the class admits a homomorphism to $(B,\pi)$. In this
work, and in support of our conjecture, we prove it for the subclass of signed
$K_4$-minor free graphs. Inspired by this development, we then investigate the
problem of finding optimal homomorphism bounds for subclasses of signed
$K_4$-minor-free graphs with restrictions on their girth and we present nearly
optimal solutions. Our work furthermore leads to the development of weighted
signed graphs.

the clause deletion scheme. Most current solvers have two (or more) stores of
clauses. One has ``valuable'' clauses which are never deleted. Most learned
clauses are added to the other, with an aggressive deletion strategy to
restrict its size. Recent solvers in the MapleSAT family, have comparatively
complex deletion scheme, and perform well. Many solvers store only binary
clauses permanently, but MapleLCMDistChronoBT stores clauses with small LBD
permanently. We report an experimental study of the permanent clause store in
MapleLCMDistChronoBT. We observe that this store can get quite large, but
several methods for limiting its size reduced performance. We also show that
alternate size and LBD based criteria improve performance, while still having
large permanent stores. In particular, saving clauses up to size 8, and adding
small numbers of high-centrality clauses, both improved performance, with the
best improvement using both methods.

objective function given a static dataset of input-output queries. A popular
approach to solving this problem is maintaining a proxy model, e.g., a deep
neural network (DNN), that approximates the true objective function. Here, the
main challenge is how to avoid adversarially optimized inputs during the
search, i.e., the inputs where the DNN highly overestimates the true objective
function. To handle the issue, we propose a new framework, coined robust model
adaptation (RoMA), based on gradient-based optimization of inputs over the DNN.
Specifically, it consists of two steps: (a) a pre-training strategy to robustly
train the proxy model and (b) a novel adaptation procedure of the proxy model
to have robust estimates for a specific set of candidate solutions. At a high
level, our scheme utilizes the local smoothness prior to overcome the
brittleness of the DNN. Experiments under various tasks show the effectiveness
of RoMA compared with previous methods, obtaining state-of-the-art results,
e.g., RoMA outperforms all at 4 out of 6 tasks and achieves runner-up results
at the remaining tasks.

patch-based augmentations, to generate negative samples. These samples achieve
better generalization, especially under out-of-domain settings. We also analyze
our method and the generated texture-based samples, showing that texture

their respective counterparts in a reference image for the computation of the
current head pose. Afterwards, a prediction approach is used to guess the most

adapted to determine the path and local frames taken between the two poses. The
result is a smooth head trajectory that serves as an input to set the camera in

advantage of being: continuous in time, it adapts to any frame rate of

it is smooth and free from rendering jerks; and it is also torsion and
curvature minimizing as it produces a path with minimum bending energy.

reasoning abilities employing suitable abstractions, commonsense knowledge, and
creative synthesis of problem-solving strategies. To help advance AI systems
towards such capabilities, we propose a new reasoning challenge, namely Fermi
Problems (FPs), which are questions whose answers can only be approximately
estimated because their precise computation is either impractical or
impossible. For example, ""How much would the sea level rise if all ice in the
world melted?"" FPs are commonly used in quizzes and interviews to bring out and
evaluate the creative reasoning abilities of humans. To do the same for AI
systems, we present two datasets: 1) A collection of 1k real-world FPs sourced
from quizzes and olympiads; and 2) a bank of 10k synthetic FPs of intermediate
complexity to serve as a sandbox for the harder real-world challenge. In
addition to question answer pairs, the datasets contain detailed solutions in
the form of an executable program and supporting facts, helping in supervision
and evaluation of intermediate steps. We demonstrate that even extensively
fine-tuned large scale language models perform poorly on these datasets, on
average making estimates that are off by two orders of magnitude. Our
contribution is thus the crystallization of several unsolved AI problems into a
single, new challenge that we hope will spur further advances in building
systems that can reason.

the gas kinematics on 1000-10,000 au scales. The $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission
shows a velocity gradient across the protostar in a direction almost
perpendicular to the outflow. The radial profile of the peak velocity was
measured from a $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ position-velocity diagram cut along the disk
major axis. The measured peak velocity decreases with radius at a radii of
$\sim$1400-2900 au, but increases slightly or is almost constant at radii of
$r\gtrsim$2900 au. Disk-and-envelope models were compared with the observations
to understand the nature of the radial profile of the peak velocity. The
measured peak velocities are best explained by a model where the specific
angular momentum is constant within a radius of 2900 au but increases with
radius outside 2900 au. We calculated the radial profile of the specific
angular momentum from the measured peak velocities, and compared it to analytic
models of core collapse. The analytic models reproduce well the observed radial
profile of the specific angular momentum and suggest that material within a
radius of $\sim$4000-6000 au in the initial dense core has accreted to the
central protostar. Because dense cores are typically $\sim$10,000-20,000 au in
radius, and as L1489 IRS is close to the end of mass accretion phase, our
result suggests that only a fraction of a dense core eventually forms a star.

the energy hierarchy of magnetostatically coupled nanomagnets, offers an
attractive pathway to implement in-memory computation. This computational
paradigm avoids separate energy costs associated with transporting and storing
the outcome of a computational operation. Thermally-driven nanomagnetic logic
gates, which are driven solely by the ambient thermal energy, hold great
promise for energy-efficient operation, but have the disadvantage of slow
operating speeds due to the lack of spatial selectivity of currently-employed
global heating methods. As has been shown recently, this disadvantage can be
removed by employing local plasmon-assisted photo-heating. Here, we show by
means of micromagnetic and finite-elements simulations how such local heating
can be exploited to design reconfigurable nanomagnetic Boolean logic gates. The
reconfigurability of operation is achieved either by modifying the initialising
field protocol or optically, by changing the order in which horizontally and
vertically polarised laser pulses are applied. Our results thus demonstrate
that nanomagnetic logic offers itself as a fast (up to GHz), energy-efficient

a learning framework, neural view synthesis and matching, that can transfer the

unseen 3D views and nuisance variations such as the object shape, texture,
illumination or scene context. In our approach, objects are represented as 3D
cuboid meshes composed of feature vectors at each mesh vertex. The model is
initialized from a few labelled images and is subsequently used to synthesize
feature representations of unseen 3D views. The synthesized views are matched
with the feature representations of unlabelled images to generate pseudo-labels
of the 3D pose. The pseudo-labelled data is, in turn, used to train the feature
extractor such that the features at each mesh vertex are more invariant across
varying 3D views of the object. Our model is trained in an EM-type manner
alternating between increasing the 3D pose invariance of the feature extractor
and annotating unlabelled data through neural view synthesis and matching. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised learning
framework for 3D pose estimation on the PASCAL3D+ and KITTI datasets. We find

used to distinguish among concurrent evolution scenarios. However, multi-planet
systems usually host mini-Neptunes and super-Earths, whose size make orbital
architecture measurements challenging. We introduce the Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect Revolutions technique, which can access spin-orbit angles of small
planets by exploiting the full information contained in spectral transit time
series. We validated the technique on published HARPS-N data of the
mini-Neptune HD3167c, refining its high sky-projected spin-orbit angle
(-108.9+5.4-5.5 deg), and we applied it to new ESPRESSO observations of the
super-Earth HD3167b, revealing an aligned orbit (-6.6+6.6-7.9 deg).
Surprisingly different variations in the contrast of the stellar lines occulted
by the planets can be reconciled with a latitudinal dependence of the stellar
line shape. In this scenario, a joint fit to both datasets constrains the
inclination of the star (111.6+3.1-3.3 deg) and the 3D spin-orbit angles of
HD3167b (29.5+7.2-9.4 deg) and HD3167c (107.7+5.1-4.9 deg). The projected
spin-orbit angles do not depend on the model for the line contrast variations,
and so, with a mutual inclination of 102.3+7.4-8.0 deg, we conclude that the
two planets are on perpendicular orbits. This could be explained by HD3167b
being strongly coupled to the star and retaining its primordial alignment,
whereas HD3167c would have been brought to a nearly polar orbit via secular
gravitational interactions with an outer companion. Follow-up observations and
dynamical evolution simulations are required to search for this companion and
explore this scenario. HD3167b is the smallest exoplanet with a confirmed
spectroscopic Rossiter-McLaughlin signal. Our new technique opens the way to
determining the orbital architectures of the super-Earth and Earth-sized planet
populations.

capable of supporting collective modes known as lattice resonances. These
modes, which originate from the coherent multiple scattering between the

responses. Here, we show that, thanks to their collective nature, the lattice
resonances of a periodic array of metallic nanoparticles can mediate an
efficient long-range coupling between dipole emitters placed near the array.
Specifically, using a coupled dipole approach, we calculate the Green tensor of
the array connecting two points and analyze its spectral and spatial
characteristics. This quantity represents the electromagnetic field produced by
the array at a given position when excited by a unit dipole emitter located at
another one. We find that, when a lattice resonance is excited, the Green

Green tensor of vacuum. Therefore, in addition to advancing the fundamental
understanding of lattice resonances, our results show that periodic arrays of

collections of dipole emitters, which makes them a promising platform for
applications such as nanoscale energy transfer and quantum information

code which computes the large-scale temperature and ionized hydrogen fields in
a cosmologically representative volume accounting for the patchiness in these
quantities arising from reionization. The code is an extension to a previously
developed version for studying the growth of ionized regions, namely, Semi

essential for temperature calculations. This extended version of SCRIPT also
implements physical consequences of photoheating during reionization, e.g.,
radiative feedback. These enhancements allow us to predict observables which

various problems in beam optics. Thus they have found widespread use in
adaptive optics realizations that are used to correct wavefront aberrations.
However, Zernike aberrations lose their orthogonality when used in combination
with Gaussian beams, which are omnipresent in real-world optical applications.
As a consequence, Zernike aberrations in Gaussian beams start to cross-couple
between each other, a phenomenon that does not occur for Zernike aberrations in
plane waves. Here, we describe how the aberration radius influences this
cross-coupling of Zernike aberrations. Furthermore, we propose that this effect
can actually be harnessed to allow efficient compensation of higher-order

acceleration (DSA) of electrons at merger-driven shocks with Mach number
$M_{s}\lesssim3-4$ in the intracluster medium (ICM). Recent studies have
suggested that electron preacceleration and injection, prerequisite steps for
DSA, could occur at supercritical shocks with $M_{s}\gtrsim2.3$ in the ICM,
thanks to the generation of multiscale waves by microinstabilities such as the
Alfv\'en ion cyclotron (AIC) instability, the electron firehose instability
(EFI), and the whistler instability (WI). On the other hand, some relics are
observed to have subcritical shocks with $M_{s}\lesssim2.3$, leaving DSA at
such weak shocks as an outstanding problem. Reacceleration of preexisting
nonthermal electrons has been contemplated as one of possible solutions for
that puzzle. To explore this idea, we perform Particle-in-Cell (PIC)
simulations for weak quasi-perpendicular shocks in high-$\beta$ ($\beta=P_{\rm
gas}/P_{B}$) plasmas with power-law suprathermal electrons in addition to
Maxwellian thermal electrons. We find that suprathermal electrons enhance the
excitation of electron-scale waves via the EFI and WI. However, they do not
affect the ion reflection and the ensuing generation of ion-scale waves via the
AIC instability. The presence of ion-scale waves is the key for the
preacceleration of electrons up to the injection momentum, thus the shock
criticality condition for electron injection to DSA is preserved. Based on the
results, we conclude that preexisting nonthermal electrons in the preshock
region alone would not resolve the issue of electron preacceleration at
subcritical ICM shocks.

the Boolean setting, history determinism and good for gameness coincide, we
show that this is no longer the case in the quantitative setting: good for

in which history determinism, which is generally broader than determinisability
by pruning, coincides with it, which we then apply to typical quantitative

remarkable significance in both academia and industry. Theoretically, it boosts
the development of other subjects such as statistics, sociology, and data
mining. Practically, diffusion modeling provides fundamental support for many
downstream applications (\textit{e.g.}, public opinion monitoring, rumor source
identification, and viral marketing.) Tremendous efforts have been devoted to
this area to understand and quantify information diffusion dynamics. This
survey investigates and summarizes the emerging distinguished works in
diffusion modeling. We first put forward a unified information diffusion
concept in terms of three components: information, user decision, and social
vectors, followed by a detailed introduction of the methodologies for diffusion
modeling. And then, a new taxonomy adopting hybrid philosophy (\textit{i.e.,}
granularity and techniques) is proposed, and we made a series of comparative
studies on elementary diffusion models under our taxonomy from the aspects of
assumptions, methods, and pros and cons. We further summarized representative
diffusion modeling in special scenarios and significant downstream tasks based
on these elementary models. Finally, open issues in this field following the
methodology of diffusion modeling are discussed.

formation only recently, due to advances in numerical techniques and a better
understanding of the galaxy formation physics. In this paper, we develop a new
subgrid model for the turbulent dynamo that takes place in the supersonic
interstellar medium in star-forming galaxies. It is based on a mean-field
approach that computes the turbulent kinetic energy at unresolved scales (the
so-called subgrid scales) and modifies the induction equation to account for
the corresponding $\alpha$ dynamo. Our subgrid model depends on one free
parameter, the quenching parameter, that controls the saturation of the subgrid
dynamo. Thanks to this mean-field approach, we can now model the fast
amplification of the magnetic field inside turbulent star-forming galaxies,
without relying on artificially strong initial fields or without using
prohibitively expensive high-resolution simulations. We show that the evolution
of the magnetic field in our zoom-in Milky Way-like galaxy is consistent with a
simple picture, in which the field is in equipartition with the turbulent
kinetic energy inside the star-forming disc, with a field strength around 10
$\mu$G at low redshift, while at the same time strong galactic outflows fill
the halo with a slightly weaker magnetic field, whose strength (10 nG) is
consistent will the ideal MHD dilution factor. Our results are in good
agreement with recent theoretical and numerical predictions. We also compare
our simulation with Faraday depth observations at both low and high redshift,
seeing overall good agreement with some caveats. Our model naturally predicts
stronger magnetic fields at high redshift (around 100 $\mu$G in the galaxy and
1 $\mu$G in the halo), but also stronger depolarisation effects due to stronger
turbulence at early time.

infrared quantum absorption spectroscopy (IRQAS) can extract the infrared

has been an obstacle for higher sensitivity and spectrometer miniaturization.
However, experimental demonstrations have been limited to wavelengths shorter
than 5 um or in the terahertz region, and have not been realized in the
so-called fingerprint region of 1500- 500 cm^-1 (6.6 to 20 um), which is
commonly used to identify chemical compounds or molecules. Here we report the
experimental demonstration of quantum Fourier transform infrared (QFTIR)
spectroscopy in the fingerprint region, by which both absorption and phase
spectra (complex spectra) can be obtained from Fourier transformed quantum
interferograms obtained with a single pixel visible-light detector. As
demonstrations, we obtained the transmittance spectrum of a silicon wafer at
around 10 um (1000 cm^-1) and complex transmittance spectrum of a synthetic
fluoropolymer sheet, polytetrafluoroethylene, in the wavelength range of 8 to
10.5 um (1250 to 950 cm^-1), where absorption due to symmetric and asymmetric
stretching modes of C-F bonds is clearly observed. The signal-to-noise ratio

We investigate the synthetic observational signatures from numerical
models of coronal heating in an arcade to determine what features are
associated with such heating, and what tools can be used to identify them.
  Methods. We consider two simulations of coronal arcades driven by footpoint
motions with different characteristic timescales. Forward modelling is then
used, and the synthetic emission data is analysed.
  Results. The total intensity and Doppler velocities clearly show the magnetic
structure of the coronal arcade. Contrasts in the local Doppler shift also
highlight the locations of separatrix surfaces. The distinguishing feature of
the AC and DC models is that of the frequencies. Through FFT analysis of the
Doppler velocities, when short timescale footpoint motions are present, higher
frequencies are observed. For longer timescale motions, the dominant signal is
that of lower frequencies; however, higher frequencies were also detected,
which matched the natural Alfv\'en frequency of the background magnetic field.
Alfv\'enic wave signatures were identified in both models with fast wave
signatures observable in the AC model. Finally, the estimates of the kinetic
energy using the Doppler shifts were found to significantly underestimate
within these models.
  Conclusions. Observables identified within this article were from features
such as Alfv\'en waves, fast waves, the arcade structure and separatrix
surfaces. The two models were differentiated by examining the frequencies
present. The Doppler velocities cannot provide accurate estimates of the total
kinetic energy or the component parallel to the LOS. This is due to some plasma
outside the formation temperature range of the ion, the multi-directional
driver, and cancellation of the velocity along the LOS. The impact each factor
has on the estimation is dependent on the set up of the model and the chosen
emission line.

knowledge graphs (KGs) usually scale with the number of edges and can only be
applied effectively on small instance-dependent subgraphs. In this paper, we
address this issue by showing that multi-hop and more complex logical reasoning
can be accomplished separately without losing expressive power. Motivated by
this insight, we propose an approach to multi-hop reasoning that scales
linearly with the number of relation types in the graph, which is usually
significantly smaller than the number of edges or nodes. This produces a set of
candidate solutions that can be provably refined to recover the solution to the
original problem. Our experiments on knowledge-based question answering show
that our approach solves the multi-hop MetaQA dataset, achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the more challenging WebQuestionsSP, is orders of magnitude
more scalable than competitive approaches, and can achieve compositional
generalization out of the training distribution.

the nematicity (Pomeranchuk instability), which is driven by many-body effect
and stronger in flat-band systems, enhances superconducting transition
temperature in a systematic manner on the $T_{\rm c}$ dome. There, a
$s_{x^2+y^2} - d_{x^2-y^2} - d_{xy}$-wave symmetry, in place of the
conventional $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave, governs the nematicity-enhanced pairing with a
sharp rise in the $T_{\rm c}$ dome on the filling axis. When the sixfold
symmetry is spontaneously broken, the pairing becomes more compact in real
space than in the case when the symmetry is enforced. These are accompanied by
a non-Fermi character of electrons in the partially flat bands with many-body

which are goods that an agent can receive, use, and trade again for a different
good. This is often the case with books that can be read and later exchanged
for unread ones. Other examples of such easily transferable durable goods
include puzzles, video games and baby clothes.
  We introduce a model for the exchange of easily transferable durable goods.
In our model, each agent owns a set of items and demands a different set of
items. An agent is interested in receiving as many items as possible from his
demand set. We consider mechanisms that exchange items in cycles in which each
participating agent receives an item that he demands and gives an item that he
owns. We aim to develop mechanisms that have the following properties: they are
\emph{efficient}, in the sense that they maximize the total number of items
that agents receive from their demand set, they are \emph{strategyproof} (i.e.,
it is in the agents' best interest to report their preferences truthfully) and
they run in \emph{polynomial time}.
  One challenge in developing mechanisms for our setting is that the supply and
demand sets of the agents are updated after a trade cycle is executed. This
makes constructing strategyproof mechanisms in our model significantly
different from previous works, both technically and conceptually and requires
developing new tools and techniques. We prove that simultaneously satisfying
all desired properties is impossible and thus focus on studying the tradeoffs
between these properties. To this end, we provide both approximation algorithms
and impossibility results.

by spots or cloud-like co-rotating structures, which are non-stationary and
short-lived. The time-resolved radial velocity measurements, in combination
with the K2 photometry, confirm that HD 73045 does not show any periodic
variability on timescales shorter than 1.3 d, contrary to previous reports in
the literature. In addition to these new rotational variables, we discovered a
new heartbeat system, HD 73619, where no pulsational signatures are seen. The
spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric analyses indicate that HD 73619 belongs
to the peculiar Am class, with either a weak or no magnetic field considering
the 200 G detection limit of our study. The Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD)
profiles for HD 76310 indicate a complex structure in its spectra suggesting
that this star is either part of a binary system or surrounded by a cloud
shell. When placed in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, all studied stars are
evolved from main-sequence and situated in the $\delta$ Scuti instability
strip. The present work is relevant for further detailed studies of CP stars,
such as inhomogeneities (including spots) in the absence of magnetic fields and
the origin of the pulsational variability in heartbeat systems.

shear flow of a Newtonian fluid is studied by 3D direct numerical simulations
using a finite-difference and level-set method combined with the Saramito model
for the EVP fluid. This model gives rise to a yield stress behavior, where the
unyielded state of the material is described as a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic
solid and the yielded state as a viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid. Yielding of an
initially solid drop of Carbopol is simulated under successively increasing
shear rates. We proceed to examine the roles of nondimensional parameters on
the yielding process; in particular, the Bingham number ($Bi$), capillary
number ($Ca$), Weissenberg number ($Wi$), and ratio of solvent and total drop
viscosity. We find that all of these parameters, and not only $Bi$, have a
significant influence on the drop dynamics. Numerical simulations predict that
the volume of the unyielded region inside the droplet increases with $Bi$ and
$Wi$, while it decreases with $Ca$ at low $Wi$ and $Bi$. A new regime map is
obtained for the prediction of the yielded, unyielded, and partly yielded modes
as a function of $Bi$ and $Wi$. The drop deformation is studied and explained
by examining the stresses in the vicinity of the drop interface. The
deformation has a complex dependence on $Bi$ and $Wi$. At low $Bi$, the droplet
deformation shows a nonmonotonic behavior with an increasing $Wi$. In contrast,
at moderate and high $Bi$, droplet deformation always increases with $Wi$.
Moreover, it is found that the deformation increases with $Ca$ and with the
solvent to total drop viscosity ratio. A simple ordinary differential equation
model is developed to explain the various behaviours observed numerically. The
presented results are in contrast with the heuristic idea that viscoelasticity
in the dispersed phase always inhibits deformation.

commonly required to achieve state-of-the-art performance in many computer
vision tasks. Importance sampling approaches might play a key role in budgeted
training regimes, i.e. when limiting the number of training iterations. These
approaches aim at dynamically estimating the importance of each sample to focus
on the most relevant and speed up convergence. This work explores this paradigm
and how a budget constraint interacts with importance sampling approaches and
data augmentation techniques. We show that under budget restrictions,
importance sampling approaches do not provide a consistent improvement over
uniform sampling. We suggest that, given a specific budget, the best course of
action is to disregard the importance and introduce adequate data augmentation;
e.g. when reducing the budget to a 30% in CIFAR-10/100, RICAP data augmentation
maintains accuracy, while importance sampling does not. We conclude from our
work that DNNs under budget restrictions benefit greatly from variety in the
training set and that finding the right samples to train on is not the most
effective strategy when balancing high performance with low computational
requirements. Source code available at https://git.io/JKHa3 .

(OFDM)-based over-the-air (OTA) aggregation solution for wireless federated
learning (FL). In particular, the local gradients in massive IoT devices are
modulated by an analog waveform and are then transmitted using the same
wireless resources. To this end, achieving perfect waveform superposition is
the key challenge, which is difficult due to the existence of frame timing
offset (TO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO). In order to address these
issues, we propose a two-stage waveform pre-equalization technique with a
customized multiple access protocol that can estimate and then mitigate the TO
and CFO for the OTA aggregation. Based on the proposed solution, we develop a
hardware transceiver and application software to train a real-world FL task,
which learns a deep neural network to predict the received signal strength with
global positioning system information. Experiments verify that the proposed OTA
aggregation solution can achieve comparable performance to offline learning
procedures with high prediction accuracy.

a band gap reduction because of a violation of the octet rule. Moreover, the
local disorder, namely forming (4,0) or (0,4) tetrahedra, would lead to an
appreciable band gap reduction and hinder the enhancement of the optical
absorption. An off-stoichiometric Mg/Sn ratio can strongly affect the
morphology of Mg1+xSn1-xN2 samples due to the higher ionicity of the Mg-N bonds
in comparison with Zn-N bonds. Furthermore, Mg1+xSn1-xN2 compounds show an
ambipolar self-doping behavior, i.e., Mg-rich Mg1+xSn1-xN2 show p-type doping

individuals face (to get immunized or not) when the population is exposed to an
infectious disease. The model has recently gained much traction due to the
COVID-19 pandemic since the public perception of vaccines plays a significant
role in disease dynamics. This paper studies the vaccination game in the
thermodynamic limit with an analytical method derived from the 1D Ising model
called Nash equilibrium mapping. The individual dilemma regarding Vaccination
comes from an internal conflict wherein one tries to balance the perceived
advantages of immunizing with the apparent risks associated with Vaccination
which they hear through different news media. We compare the results of Nash
equilibrium(NE) mapping to other 1D Ising-based models, namely Darwinian
evolution and agent-based simulation. This study aims to analyze the behaviour
of an infinite population regarding what fraction of people choose to vaccinate
or not vaccinate. While Nash equilibrium mapping and agent-based simulation
agree mostly, Darwinian evolution strays far from the two models. It fails to
predict the equilibrium behaviour of players in the population reasonably. We
apply the results of our study to analyze the Astra-Zeneca(AZ) COVID-19 vaccine
risk versus disease deaths debate, both via NE mapping and agent-based method.
Both predict near 100% AZ vaccine coverage for people above 40, notwithstanding
the risk. At the same time, younger people show a slight reluctance. We predict
that while government intervention via vaccination mandates and advertisement
campaigns is unnecessary for the older population, for the younger population
(ages: 20-39), some encouragement from the government via media campaigns and
vaccine mandates may be necessary.

popular saliency methods should not be used for explainability purposes since
the maps they produce are not sensitive to the underlying model that is to be

empirical evaluation does not fully establish these conclusions, due to a form
of confounding introduced by the tasks they evaluate on. Through various

Small data (in critical weak-Lebesgue space) global well-posedness is obtained
in $C_{b}([0,\infty);L^{q_c,\infty}(\RR^{n}))$. As a direct consequence, global
existence for data in strong critical Lebesgue $L^{q_c}(\RR^{n})$ follows under
a smallness condition while uniqueness is unconditional. Besides, we prove the
existence of self-similar solutions and examine the long time behavior of
globally defined solutions. The zero solution $u\equiv 0$ is shown to be
asymptotically stable in $L^{q_c}(\RR^{n})$ -- it is the only self-similar
solution which is initially small in $L^{q_c}(\RR^{n})$. Moreover, blow-up
results are obtained under mild assumptions on the initial data and the
corresponding Fujita critical exponent is found.

real-world applications, and it is traditionally achieved via wearable sensing.
Recently, to avoid the burden and discomfort caused by wearable devices,
device-free approaches exploiting RF signals arise as a promising alternative
for HAR. Most of the latest device-free approaches require training a large
deep neural network model in either time or frequency domain, entailing
extensive storage to contain the model and intensive computations to infer
activities. Consequently, even with some major advances on device-free HAR,
current device-free approaches are still far from practical in real-world
scenarios where the computation and storage resources possessed by, for
example, edge devices, are limited. Therefore, we introduce HAR-SAnet which is
a novel RF-based HAR framework. It adopts an original signal adapted
convolutional neural network architecture: instead of feeding the handcraft
features of RF signals into a classifier, HAR-SAnet fuses them adaptively from
both time and frequency domains to design an end-to-end neural network model.
We apply point-wise grouped convolution and depth-wise separable convolutions
to confine the model scale and to speed up the inference execution time. The
experiment results show that the recognition accuracy of HAR-SAnet outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms and systems.

activation maps (CAMs) for pseudo labels generation. As CAMs only highlight the
most discriminative regions of objects, the generated pseudo labels are usually
unsatisfactory to serve directly as supervision. To solve this, most existing
approaches follow a multi-training pipeline to refine CAMs for better
pseudo-labels, which includes: 1) re-training the classification model to
generate CAMs; 2) post-processing CAMs to obtain pseudo labels; and 3) training
a semantic segmentation model with the obtained pseudo labels. However, this
multi-training pipeline requires complicated adjustment and additional time. To
address this, we propose a class-conditional inference strategy and an
activation aware mask refinement loss function to generate better pseudo labels
without re-training the classifier. The class conditional inference-time
approach is presented to separately and iteratively reveal the classification
network's hidden object activation to generate more complete response maps.
Further, our activation aware mask refinement loss function introduces a novel
way to exploit saliency maps during segmentation training and refine the
foreground object masks without suppressing background objects. Our method
achieves superior WSSS results without requiring re-training of the classifier.

theoretical framework and an algorithm for the recognition of twinned pairs of
ferroelastic domains and the identification of the coherent twin relationship
using high-resolution reciprocal space mapping of X-ray diffraction intensity
around split Bragg peaks. Specifically, we adapt the geometrical theory of
twinned ferroelastic crystals (Fousek & Janovec, 1969) for the analysis of the
X-ray diffraction patterns. We derive the necessary equations and outline an
algorithm for calculation of the separation between the Bragg peaks, diffracted
from possible coherent twin domains, connected to one another via mismatch-free
interface. We demonstrate that such separation is always perpendicular to the
planar interface between mechanically matched domains. As examples, we present
the analysis of the separation between the peaks diffracted from tetragonal and
rhombohedral domains in the high-resolution reciprocal space maps of BaTiO3 and
PbZr1-xTixO3 crystals. The demonstrated method can be used to analyse the

Ideally, how a node receives its neighborhood information should be a function

To utilize node locality without overfitting, we propose a node-wise
localization of GNNs by accounting for both global and local aspects of the

encode the general patterns across the graph; locally, each node is localized

on the calibration of polarization angles. Miscalibrated polarization angles
induce a mixing of E- and B-modes that obscures the primordial B-mode signal.
We introduce an iterative angular power spectra maximum likelihood-based method
to calculate polarization angles from the multi-frequency signal. The basis
behind this methodology grounds on nulling the EB power spectra. To simplify
the likelihood, we assume that the rotation angles are small (<6 deg) and, the
maximum likelihood solution for the rotation angles is obtained by applying an
iterative process where the covariance matrix does not depend on the angles per
iteration, i.e., the rotation angles are fixed to the estimated angles in the
previous iteration. With these assumptions, we obtain an analytical linear
system which leads to a very fast computational implementation. We show that
with this methodology we are able to determine the rotation angle for each
frequency with sufficiently good accuracy. To prove the latter point we perform
component separation analyses using the parametric component separation method
B-SeCRET with two different approaches. In the first approach we apply the
B-SeCRET pipeline to the signal de-rotated with the estimation of the angles,
while in the second, the rotation angles are treated as model parameters using
the estimation of the angles as a prior information. We obtain that the
rotation angles estimations improve after applying the second approach, and
show that the systematic residuals due to the non-null calibration polarization
angles are mitigated to the order of a 1% at the power spectrum level.

graph attention layers are meant to capture temporal features while the
spectral-based GCN layer is meant to capture spatial features. The main novelty
of the model is the integration of time series of four different time
granularities: the original time series, together with hourly, daily, and
weekly time series. Unlike previous work that used multi-granularity time
series by handling every time series separately, GACAN combines the outcome of
processing all time series after each graph attention layer. Thus, the effects
of different time granularities are integrated throughout the model. We perform
a series of experiments on three real-world datasets. The experimental results
verify the advantage of using multi-granularity time series and that the
proposed GACAN model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

maximum variance of the bias. Second, we mitigate biases by mapping image
inputs to label embedding spaces. Each value of the protected attribute has its
projection head where classes are embedded through a latent vector
representation rather than a common one-hot encoding. Once trained, we further
reduce in the feature space the bias effect by removing its direction.

partially permeate (leak) through such boundaries. We specifically focus on
rectangular nanolanes defined as areas confined between a pair of parallel

identify metalizable states whose bandgaps can continuously be decreased to

the least time difference between the occurrence of the predicted peak value

follow-up of extrasolar planet candidates. While the transit signal of a
Jupiter-sized object can typically be detected to a high level of confidence
with small telescope apertures as well, the shallow transit dips of planets
with the size of Neptune and smaller are more challenging to reveal. We employ
new observational data to illustrate the photometric follow-up capabilities of
meter-sized telescopes for shallow exoplanet transits. We describe in detail
the capability of distinguishing the photometric signal of an exoplanet transit
from an underlying trend in the light curve. The transit depths of the six
targets we observed, Kepler-94b, Kepler-63b, K2-100b, K2-138b, K2-138c, and
K2-138e, range from 3.9 ppt down to 0.3 ppt. For five targets of this sample,
we provide the first ground-based photometric follow-up. We detect or rule out
the transit features significantly in single observations for the targets that
show transits of 1.3 ppt or deeper. The shallower transit depths of two targets
of 0.6 and 0.8 ppt were detected tentatively in single light curves, and were
detected significantly by repeated observations. Only for the target of the
shallowest transit depth of 0.3 ppt were we unable to draw a significant
conclusion despite combining five individual light curves. An
injection-recovery test on our real data shows that we detect transits of 1.3
ppt depth significantly in single light curves if the transit is fully covered,
including out-of-transit data toward both sides, in some cases down to 0.7 ppt
depth. For Kepler-94b, Kepler-63b, and K2-100b, we were able to verify the
ephemeris. In the case of K2-138c with a 0.6 ppt deep transit, we were able to
refine it, and in the case of K2-138e, we ruled out the transit in the time
interval of more than +-1.5 sigma of its current literature ephemeris.

this paper, we propose a novel detector for OTFS systems, referred to as the
Bayesian based parallel interference and decision statistics combining
(B-PIC-DSC) OTFS detector that can achieve a high BER performance, under high

dissimilar approaches to reduce transmission risks: a strategy to augment the
indoor ventilation capacity with portable air purifiers and a strategy to
utilize partitioning by exploiting portable space dividers. To substantiate the
physical relevance of the LES model, a set of experimental aerosol
concentration measurements are carried out, and their results are used for
validating the LES model results. The obtained LES dispersion results are
subjected to pathogen exposure and infection probability analysis. Wells-Riley
probability model is extended to rely on realistic time- and space-dependent
concentration fields to yield time- and space-dependent infection probability
fields. The use of air purifiers leads to greater reduction in absolute risks
compared to the analytical Wells-Riley model, which fails to predict the
original risk level. However, the two models do agree on the relative risk
reduction. The spatial partitioning strategy is demonstrated to have an
undesirable effect when employed without other measures. The partitioning
approach may yield positive results when employed together with targeted air
purifier units. The LES-based results are examined in juxtaposition with the
classical Wells-Riley model, which is shown to significantly underestimate the
infection probability, highlighting the importance of employing accurate indoor

contributions of nutrient concentrations in river-aquifer systems. Using a
fully coupled transient flow and reactive transport model, we investigated the
denitrification potential of hyporheic zones during peak-flow events. The
effects of streambed permeability, channel gradient and bedform amplitude on
the spatio-temporal distribution of nitrate and dissolved organic carbon in
streambeds and the associated denitrification potential were explored. Distinct
peak-flow events with different intensity, duration and hydrograph shape were
selected to represent a wide range of peak-flow scenarios. Our results
indicated that the specific hydrodynamic characteristics of individual flow
events largely determine the average positive or negative nitrate removal
capacity of hyporheic zones, however the magnitude of this capacity is
controlled by geomorphological settings (i.e. channel slope, streambed
permeability and bedform amplitude). Specifically, events with longer duration
and higher intensity were shown to promote higher nitrate removal efficiency
with higher magnitude of removal efficiency in the scenarios with higher slope
and permeability values. These results are essential for better assessment of
the subsurface nitrate removal capacity under the influence of flow dynamics

multiplicative constant. Moreover, we formulate the continuity condition on $A$

of graph convolution which can be realized by message passing between direct
neighbors or beyond. To scale such GNNs to large graphs, various neighbor-,
layer-, or subgraph-sampling techniques are proposed to alleviate the ""neighbor
explosion"" problem by considering only a small subset of messages passed to the
nodes in a mini-batch. However, sampling-based methods are difficult to apply
to GNNs that utilize many-hops-away or global context each layer, show unstable
performance for different tasks and datasets, and do not speed up model
inference. We propose a principled and fundamentally different approach,
VQ-GNN, a universal framework to scale up any convolution-based GNNs using
Vector Quantization (VQ) without compromising the performance. In contrast to
sampling-based techniques, our approach can effectively preserve all the
messages passed to a mini-batch of nodes by learning and updating a small
number of quantized reference vectors of global node representations, using VQ
within each GNN layer. Our framework avoids the ""neighbor explosion"" problem of
GNNs using quantized representations combined with a low-rank version of the
graph convolution matrix. We show that such a compact low-rank version of the
gigantic convolution matrix is sufficient both theoretically and
experimentally. In company with VQ, we design a novel approximated message
passing algorithm and a nontrivial back-propagation rule for our framework.
Experiments on various types of GNN backbones demonstrate the scalability and
competitive performance of our framework on large-graph node classification and
link prediction benchmarks.

many existing mechanisms directly use the contextual information to recalibrate
the input, which unilaterally enhances the propagation of the informative

with confidence suppresses useless information while enhancing the informative

large-scale datasets that continue to grow in size. Increasingly, those

datasets are hard to annotate, and annotations may contain biases that we are
often unaware of. Deep-net-based classifiers, in turn, are prone to exploit
those biases and to find shortcuts. To study and quantify this concern, we
introduce the perceptual score, a metric that assesses the degree to which a
model relies on the different subsets of the input features, i.e., modalities.
Using the perceptual score, we find a surprisingly consistent trend across four
popular datasets: recent, more accurate state-of-the-art multi-modal models for
visual question-answering or visual dialog tend to perceive the visual data
less than their predecessors. This trend is concerning as answers are hence
increasingly inferred from textual cues only. Using the perceptual score also
helps to analyze model biases by decomposing the score into data subset
contributions. We hope to spur a discussion on the perceptiveness of
multi-modal models and also hope to encourage the community working on
multi-modal classifiers to start quantifying perceptiveness via the proposed
perceptual score.

not been well understood, especially regarding how to control the extent of
smoothness. Intuitively, too small or too large smoothing iterations may cause
under-smoothing or over-smoothing and can lead to sub-optimal performance.
Moreover, the extent of smoothness is node-specific, depending on its degree
and local structure. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called
node-dependent local smoothing (NDLS), which aims to control the smoothness of
every node by setting a node-specific smoothing iteration. Specifically, NDLS
computes influence scores based on the adjacency matrix and selects the
iteration number by setting a threshold on the scores. Once selected, the
iteration number can be applied to both feature smoothing and label smoothing.
Experimental results demonstrate that NDLS enjoys high accuracy --

contents of the video snippets plays an important role for the final
performance. However, existing video architectures usually generate it by using
a simple, global average pooling (GAP) method, which has limited ability to
capture complex dynamics of videos. For image recognition task, there exist
evidences showing that covariance pooling has stronger representation ability
than GAP. Unfortunately, such plain covariance pooling used in image
recognition is an orderless representative, which cannot model spatio-temporal
structure inherent in videos. Therefore, this paper proposes a
Temporal-attentive Covariance Pooling(TCP), inserted at the end of deep
architectures, to produce powerful video representations. Specifically, our TCP
first develops a temporal attention module to adaptively calibrate
spatio-temporal features for the succeeding covariance pooling, approximatively
producing attentive covariance representations. Then, a temporal covariance
pooling performs temporal pooling of the attentive covariance representations
to characterize both intra-frame correlations and inter-frame
cross-correlations of the calibrated features. As such, the proposed TCP can
capture complex temporal dynamics. Finally, a fast matrix power normalization
is introduced to exploit geometry of covariance representations. Note that our
TCP is model-agnostic and can be flexibly integrated into any video
architectures, resulting in TCPNet for effective video recognition. The
extensive experiments on six benchmarks (e.g., Kinetics, Something-Something V1
and Charades) using various video architectures show our TCPNet is clearly
superior to its counterparts, while having strong generalization ability. The

class of $n$-dimensional centered convex bodies. We then pass to the dimension
independent (i.e. log-concave) case where we find a 1-parameter family of

In the traffic4cast competition, the task of short-term traffic prediction is
tackled in unprecedented detail, with traffic volume and speed information
available at 5 minute intervals and high spatial resolution. To improve
generalization to unknown cities, as required in the 2021 extended challenge,
we propose to predict small quadratic city sections, rather than processing a
full-city-raster at once. At test time, breaking down the test data into
spatially-cropped overlapping snippets improves stability and robustness of the
final predictions, since multiple patches covering one cell can be processed
independently. With the performance on the traffic4cast test data and further
experiments on a validation set it is shown that patch-wise prediction indeed
improves accuracy. Further advantages can be gained with a Unet++ architecture
and with an increasing number of patches per sample processed at test time. We
conclude that our snippet-based method, combined with other successful network
architectures proposed in the competition, can leverage performance, in
particular on unseen cities. All source code is available at

Gaussian processes with different fidelities we can fight the curse of
dimensionality affecting these kind of quantities of interest, especially for
many-query applications. In particular we seek a gradient-based reduction of

transformation of the input space. Then we build a low-fidelity response
surface based on such reduction, thus enabling multi-fidelity Gaussian process
regression without the need of running new simulations with simplified physical

algorithm decide which weights to change, i.e., by learning where to learn. We
find that patterned sparsity emerges from this process, with the pattern of
sparsity varying on a problem-by-problem basis. This selective sparsity results
in better generalization and less interference in a range of few-shot and
continual learning problems. Moreover, we find that sparse learning also
emerges in a more expressive model where learning rates are meta-learned. Our

power-law distribution. We find the range of the interactions plays a key role
in characterizing both phases and their measurement-induced transitions. For
the cluster unitary gates we find a transition between a phase with volume-law
scaling of the entanglement entropy and a phase with area-law entanglement
entropy. Our results indicate that the universality class of the phase
transition is compatible to that of short range hybrid Clifford circuits.
Oppositely, in the case of power-law distributed gates, we find the

intermediate values of the control parameter, we find a non-conformal critical
line which separates a phase with volume-law scaling of the entanglement
entropy from one with sub-extensive scaling. Within this region, we find the

excellent systems to experimentally study phase transitions in dense colloidal

are challenging due to the deformability and possibility for interpenetration

the strong scattering signal from the gold cores with respect to the almost

show that the sparse second-order Transformers with kernel attention are
theoretically more expressive than message passing operations while having an

theoretical models of hydrogen (H) and helium (He) dominated atmospheres. We
estimated the PDF for effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity, parallax,
and spectral type; and the probability of having a H-dominated atmosphere (pH)
for each source. We applied a prior in parallax, using Gaia EDR3 measurements
as reference, and derived a self-consistent prior for the atmospheric
composition as a function of Teff. We described the fraction of He-dominated
atmosphere white dwarfs (fHe) with a linear function of Teff at 5000 < Teff <
30000 K. We found fHe = 0.24 +- 0.01 at Teff = 10000 K, a change rate along the
cooling sequence of 0.14 +- 0.02 per 10 kK, and a minimum He-dominated fraction
of 0.08 +- 0.02 at the high-temperature end. We tested the obtained pH by
comparison with spectroscopic classifications, finding that it is reliable. We
estimated the mass distribution for the 351 sources with distance d < 100 pc,
mass M > 0.45 Msun, and Teff > 6000 K. The result for H-dominated white dwarfs
agrees with previous work, with a dominant M = 0.59 Msun peak and the presence
of an excess at M ~ 0.8 Msun. This high-mass excess is absent in the
He-dominated distribution, which presents a single peak. The J-PLUS optical
data provides a reliable statistical classification of white dwarfs into H- and
He-dominated atmospheres. We find a 21 +- 3 % increase in the fraction of
He-dominated white dwarfs from Teff = 20000 K to Teff = 5000 K.

the speaker voice in the synthesized speech to be different from the desired
target speakers. To prevent this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised

that can represent the prosody styles of different speakers. We then use the
learned prosodic representations as conditional information to train and
enhance our VC model for zero-shot conversion. In our experiments, we show that

Moreover, we demonstrate that the addition of our prosody representations

construction of optimal decision-making systems. Motivated by a desire to
deploy Gaussian processes in novel areas of science, a rapidly-growing line of
research has focused on constructively extending these models to handle
non-Euclidean domains, including Riemannian manifolds, such as spheres and
tori. We propose techniques that generalize this class to model vector fields
on Riemannian manifolds, which are important in a number of application areas
in the physical sciences. To do so, we present a general recipe for
constructing gauge independent kernels, which induce Gaussian vector fields,
i.e. vector-valued Gaussian processes coherent with geometry, from
scalar-valued Riemannian kernels. We extend standard Gaussian process training
methods, such as variational inference, to this setting. This enables

approximation driven by Markovian noise: $$ \theta_{n+1}= \theta_n + \alpha_{n

$\theta_n\in\Re^d$, $ \{ \Phi_n \}$ is a Markov chain on a general state space
X with stationary distribution $\pi$, and $f:\Re^d\times \text{X} \to\Re^d$. In
addition to standard Lipschitz bounds on $f$, and conditions on the vanishing
step-size sequence $\{\alpha_n\}$, it is assumed that the associated ODE is
globally asymptotically stable with stationary point denoted $\theta^*$, where
$\bar f(\theta)=E[f(\theta,\Phi)]$ with $\Phi\sim\pi$. Moreover, the
ODE@$\infty$ defined with respect to the vector field, $$ \bar
f_\infty(\theta):= \lim_{r\to\infty} r^{-1} \bar f(r\theta) \,,\qquad
\theta\in\Re^d, $$ is asymptotically stable. The main contributions are
summarized as follows:
  (i) The sequence $\theta$ is convergent if $\Phi$ is geometrically ergodic,
and subject to compatible bounds on $f$.
  The remaining results are established under a stronger assumption on the
Markov chain: A slightly weaker version of the Donsker-Varadhan Lyapunov drift
condition known as (DV3).
  (ii) A Lyapunov function is constructed for the joint process
$\{\theta_n,\Phi_n\}$ that implies convergence of $\{ \theta_n\}$ in $L_4$.
  (iii) A functional CLT is established, as well as the usual one-dimensional
CLT for the normalized error $z_n:= (\theta_n-\theta^*)/\sqrt{\alpha_n}$.
Moment bounds combined with the CLT imply convergence of the normalized
covariance, $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} E [ z_n z_n^T ] = \Sigma_\theta, $$ where
$\Sigma_\theta$ is the asymptotic covariance appearing in the CLT.
  (iv) An example is provided where the Markov chain $\Phi$ is geometrically

of excitons in BBG and calculate the exciton band structures and optical matrix
elements for field strengths in the range $30-300 \,

field dependence, with both energy ordering and dipole alignment varying
significantly between the low and high field regions. Namely, at low fields we
find a mostly dark ground state exciton, as opposed to high fields, where the
lowest exciton is bright. Also, excitons preferentially align with a dipole
moment opposite the field, due to the field-induced charge transfer in the
ground state of BBG. However, in stronger fields, this alignment becomes
energetically less favorable. Additionally, the bright excitons show particle-
and light-like bands similar to monolayer transition metal dichalchogenides.
Finally, we model the radiative lifetimes and emission properties of BBG, which
prove to be strongly dependent on temperature in addition to field strength.

  Perspective",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of nonparametric estimation of the drift and
diffusion coefficients of a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), based on
$n$ independent replicates $\left\{X_i(t)\::\: t\in [0,1]\right\}_{1
  \leq i \leq n}$, observed sparsely and irregularly on the unit interval, and
subject to additive noise corruption. By \textit{sparse} we intend to mean that
the number of measurements per path can be arbitrary (as small as two), and
remain constant with respect to $n$. We focus on time-inhomogeneous SDE of the
form $dX_t = \mu(t)X_t^{\alpha}dt + \sigma(t)X_t^{\beta}dW_t$, where $\alpha
\in \{0,1\}$ and $\beta \in \{0,1/2,1\}$, which includes prominent examples
such as Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, geometric Brownian motion,
and Brownian bridge.
  Our estimators are constructed by relating the local (drift/diffusion)
parameters of the diffusion to their global parameters (mean/covariance, and
their derivatives) by means of an apparently novel PDE. This allows us to use
methods inspired by functional data analysis, and pool information across the
sparsely measured paths. The methodology we develop is fully non-parametric and
avoids any functional form specification on the time-dependency of either the
drift function or the diffusion function. We establish almost sure uniform
asymptotic convergence rates of the proposed estimators as the number of
observed curves $n$ grows to infinity. Our rates are non-asymptotic in the
number of measurements per path, explicitly reflecting how different sampling
frequency might affect the speed of convergence. Our framework suggests
possible further fruitful interactions between FDA and SDE methods in problems
with replication.

counterpart surficial lithologies. A Gated Shape Convolutional Neural Network
algorithm was trained on a generated synthetic dataset to perform geological
mapping of airborne magnetic data and detect lithological contacts. The
algorithm also provides attention maps highlighting the structures at different
scales, and clustering was applied to its high-level features to do a

methodology is suitable to segment the surficial geology using airborne

magnetic anomalies into a pertinent geological map. Moreover, the first
attention map isolates the structures at low scales and shows a pertinent

engineering systems are generally subject to physics constraints that may
induce fatal failures when they are violated, while such constraints are
frequently underestimated in active learning. In this paper, we develop a novel
active learning method that avoids failures considering implicit physics
constraints that govern the system. The proposed approach is driven by two
tasks: the safe variance reduction explores the safe region to reduce the
variance of the target model, and the safe region expansion aims to extend the
explorable region exploiting the probabilistic model of constraints. The global
acquisition function is devised to judiciously optimize acquisition functions
of two tasks, and its theoretical properties are provided. The proposed method

zero-failure without the knowledge of explicit failure regions.

weak such that, under tensile loading, CNTs can easily slide inside the Al

independent of CNT length and volume fraction. Little load transfer and
consequently no crack bridging are observed during the simulation of pristine
CNTs threading the crack surfaces. CNTs that are geometrically fixated inside
Al, on the other hand, can increase the fracture stress and enhance plastic

scenario generation approach uses deep generative models (DGM) that allow
scenario generation without prior assumptions about the data distribution.
However, the validation of generated scenarios is difficult, and a
comprehensive discussion about appropriate validation methods is currently
lacking. To start this discussion, we provide a critical assessment of the
currently used validation methods in the energy scenario generation literature.
In particular, we assess validation methods based on probability density,
auto-correlation, and power spectral density. Furthermore, we propose using the
multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) as an additional validation
method for non-trivial features like peaks, bursts, and plateaus. As
representative examples, we train generative adversarial networks (GANs),
Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs) on two renewable
power generation time series (photovoltaic and wind from Germany in 2013 to
2015) and an intra-day electricity price time series form the European Energy

historical and the generated data and discuss the interpretation of validation
results as well as common mistakes, pitfalls, and limitations of the validation
methods. Our assessment shows that no single method sufficiently characterizes
a scenario but ideally validation should include multiple methods and be

(PDM) techniques have been used previously to claim detections of QPOs in AGN
light curves. In this paper we perform Monte Carlo simulations to empirically
test QPO detection feasibility in the presence of red noise. Given the
community's access to large databases of monitoring light curves via large-area
monitoring programmes, our goal is to provide guidance to those searching for
QPOs via data trawls. We simulate evenly-sampled pure red noise light curves to
estimate false alarm probabilities; false positives in both tools tend to occur
towards timescales longer than (very roughly) one-third of the light curve
duration. We simulate QPOs mixed with pure red noise and determine the
true-positive detection sensitivity; in both tools, it depends strongly on the
relative strength of the QPO against the red noise and on the steepness of the
red noise PSD slope. We find that extremely large values of peak QPO power
relative to red noise (typically $\sim 10^{4-5}$) are needed for a 99.7 per
cent true-positive detection rate. Given that the true-positive detections
using the ACF or PDM are generally rare to obtain, we conclude that period
searches based on the ACF or PDM must be treated with extreme caution when the
data quality is not good. We consider the feasibility of QPO detection in the

intensity of interaction over an edge is proportional to the product of the
amounts of data in each node at either end of the edge. The maximum sum of
interactions over the edges is searched for. This model can be extended to
other interacting entities. For bipartite graphs and odd-length cycles we prove
that the greatest degree of interaction emerge when the whole data is
concentrated in an arbitrary pair of neighbors. Equal partitioning of the load
is shown to be optimum for complete graphs. Finally, we show that in general
graphs for maximum interaction the data should be distributed equally between
the nodes of the largest clique in the graph. We also present in this context a
result of Motzkin and Straus from 1965 for the maximal interaction objective.

However, it is challenging to collect high quality hand movement video data,
especially for older participants, many of whom have no IT background. During
the data collection process, one of the key steps is to detect whether the
participants are following the test instructions correctly and also to detect
similar gestures from different devices. Furthermore, we need this process to
be automated and accurate as we expect many thousands of participants to
complete the test. We have implemented a hand gesture detector to detect the
gestures in the hand movement tests and our detection mAP is 0.782 which is
better than the state-of-the-art. In this research, we have processed 20,000
images collected from hand movement tests and labelled 6,450 images to detect
different hand gestures in the hand movement tests. This paper has the
following three contributions. Firstly, we compared and analysed the
performance of different network structures for hand gesture detection.
Secondly, we have made many attempts to improve the accuracy of the model and
have succeeded in improving the classification accuracy for similar gestures by
implementing attention layers. Thirdly, we have created two datasets and
included 20 percent of blurred images in the dataset to investigate how
different network structures were impacted by noisy data, our experiments have
also shown our network has better performance on the noisy dataset.

science and engineering including porous media flow, biological flows,
microfluidics, microrobotics, and hydrodynamic lubrication. The present study
concerns the discretization of the equations of motion of Stokes flows in three
dimensions utilizing the MINI mixed finite element, focusing on the
superconvergence of the method which was investigated with numerical
experiments using five purpose-made benchmark test cases with analytical
solution. Despite the fact that the MINI element is only linearly convergent
according to standard mixed finite element theory, a recent theoretical
development proves that, for structured meshes in two dimensions, the pressure
superconverges with order 1.5, as well as the linear part of the computed
velocity with respect to the piecewise-linear nodal interpolation of the exact
velocity. The numerical experiments documented herein suggest a more general
validity of the superconvergence in pressure, possibly to unstructured
tetrahedral meshes and even up to quadratic convergence which was observed with
one test problem, thereby indicating that there is scope to further extend the
available theoretical results on convergence.

sample-efficient than their on-policy counterparts, and can additionally
benefit from any off-policy data stored in the replay buffer. Expert
demonstrations are a popular source for such data: the agent is exposed to
successful states and actions early on, which can accelerate the learning
process and improve performance. In the past, multiple ideas have been proposed
to make good use of the demonstrations in the buffer, such as pretraining on
demonstrations only or minimizing additional cost functions. We carry on a
study to evaluate several of these ideas in isolation, to see which of them
have the most significant impact. We also present a new method for
sparse-reward tasks, based on a reward bonus given to demonstrations and
successful episodes. First, we give a reward bonus to the transitions coming
from demonstrations to encourage the agent to match the demonstrated behaviour.
Then, upon collecting a successful episode, we relabel its transitions with the
same bonus before adding them to the replay buffer, encouraging the agent to
also match its previous successes. The base algorithm for our experiments is
the popular Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), a state-of-the-art off-policy algorithm
for continuous action spaces. Our experiments focus on manipulation robotics,
specifically on a 3D reaching task for a robotic arm in simulation. We show
that our method SACR2 based on reward relabeling improves the performance on

($0.5-60$ keV) using AstroSat observations during the period of $2016-2019$.
The MAXI X-ray lightcurve of the source shows rise and decay profiles similar
to canonical outbursting black holes. However, the source does not follow the
exemplary 'q'-diagram in the Hardness-Intensity Diagram (HID). Model
independent analysis of lightcurves suggests that GRS 1915+105 displays various
types of variability classes ($\delta,\chi,\rho,\kappa,\omega$ and $\gamma$).
We also report possible transitions from one class to another
($\chi\rightarrow\rho,\rho\rightarrow\kappa$ via an 'unknown' class and
$\omega\rightarrow\gamma\rightarrow\omega+\gamma$) within a few hours duration.
Broadband energy spectra are well modeled with multi-coloured disc blackbody
and Comptonised components. We explore the 'spectro-temporal' features of the
source in the different variability classes, transitions between classes, and
evolution during $2016-2019$. Detailed analysis indicates a gradual increase in
the photon index ($\Gamma$) from $1.83$ to $3.8$, disc temperature ($kT_{in}$)
from $1.33$ to $2.67$ keV, and Quasi-periodic Oscillation (QPO) frequency
($\nu$) from $4$ to $5.64$ Hz during the rise, while the parameters decrease to
$\Gamma$ ~$1.18$, $kT_{in}$ ~$1.18$ keV, and $\nu$ ~$1.38$ Hz respectively in
the decline phase. The source shows maximum bolometric luminosity (L$_{bol}$)
during the peak at ~$36$% of Eddington luminosity (L$_{EDD}$), and a minimum of
~$2.4$% L$_{EDD}$ during the decay phase. Further evolution of the source
towards an obscured low-luminosity (L$_{bol}$ of ~ 1% L$_{EDD}$) phase, with a
decrease in the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the source due to
obscuration, has also been indicated from our analysis. The implication of our

simultaneously trade-off safe exploration and task fulfillment. In this paper,
we introduce a new generation of RL solvers that learn to minimise safety
violations while maximising the task reward to the extent that can be tolerated
by the safe policy. Our approach introduces a novel two-player framework for
safe RL called Distributive Exploration Safety Training Algorithm (DESTA). The
core of DESTA is a game between two adaptive agents: Safety Agent that is
delegated the task of minimising safety violations and Task Agent whose goal is
to maximise the environment reward. Specifically, Safety Agent can selectively
take control of the system at any given point to prevent safety violations
while Task Agent is free to execute its policy at any other states. This
framework enables Safety Agent to learn to take actions at certain states that
minimise future safety violations, both during training and testing time, while
Task Agent performs actions that maximise the task performance everywhere else.
Theoretically, we prove that DESTA converges to stable points enabling safety
violations of pretrained policies to be minimised. Empirically, we show DESTA's
ability to augment the safety of existing policies and secondly, construct safe
RL policies when the Task Agent and Safety Agent are trained concurrently. We
demonstrate DESTA's superior performance against leading RL methods in Lunar

common genetic origin. Mineral particles are like humans: they appear different
despite having a same geological origin. Then, do the particles have some sort
of 'phenotypic trait' in the geometries as we do? How can we characterize the
phenotypic trait of particle geometries? This paper discusses a new perspective
on how the phenotypic trait can be discovered in the particle geometries and
how the 'variation' and 'average' of the geometry can be quantified. The key
idea is using the power-law between particle surface-area-to-volume ratio
($A/V$) and the particle volume ($V$) that uncovers the phenotypic trait in
terms of ${\alpha}$ and ${\beta}^*$: From the log-transformed relation of $V =
(A/V)^{\alpha} {\times} {\beta}^*$, the power value ${\alpha}$ represents the
relation between shape and size, while the term ${\beta}^*$ (evaluated by
fixing ${\alpha}$ = -3) informs the angularity of the average shape in the
granular material. In other words, ${\alpha}$ represents the 'variation' of the
geometry while ${\beta}^*$ is concerned with the 'average' geometry of a
granular material. Furthermore, this study finds that $A/V$ and $V$ can be also
used to characterize individual particle shape in terms of Wadell's true
Sphericity ($S$). This paper also revisits the $M = A/V {\times} L/6$ concept
originally introduced by Su et al. (2020) and finds the shape index $M$ is an
extended form of $S$ providing additional information about the particle
elongation. Therefore, the proposed method using $A/V$ and $V$ provides a
unified approach that can characterize the particle geometry at multiple scales
from granular material to a single particle.

Following their initial compression, such 'failed' cores re-expand, rather than
collapsing. We propose that their formation and subsequent dispersal regulate
the gas density of cluster-forming clumps and, therefore, their core and star
formation rates. Clumps for which failed cores are the dominant core type
experience star formation histories with peaks and troughs. In contrast, too
few failed cores results in smoothly decreasing star formation rates. We
identify three main parameters shaping the star formation history of a clump:
the star and core formation efficiencies per free-fall time, and the time-scale
on which failed cores return to the clump gas. The clump mass acts as a scaling
factor. We use our model to constrain the density and mass of the Orion Nebula
Cluster progenitor clump, and to caution that the star formation histories of
starburst clusters may contain close-by peaks concealed by stellar age
uncertainties. Our model generates a great variety of star formation histories.
Intriguingly, the chromosome maps and O-Na anti-correlations of old globular
clusters also present diverse morphologies. This prompts us to discuss our
model in the context of globular cluster multiple stellar populations. More
massive globular clusters exhibit stronger multiple stellar population
patterns, which our model can explain if the formation of the polluting stars
requires a given stellar mass threshold.

accordance with the predictions of the linear theory, i.e. it is quantized and
determined by the dynamical Chern numbers of the lowest band. The breakdown of
the transport is also explained by nontrivial topology of the bands. In that
case, the nonlinearity induces Rabi oscillations of atoms between two (or more)
lowest bands. If the sum of the dynamical Chern numbers of the populated bands

corresponds to the transport breakdown. Otherwise the sum of the Chern numbers

to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis. In MRI, restricted by hardware
capacity, scan time, and patient cooperation ability, isotropic 3D HR image
acquisition typically requests long scan time and, results in small spatial
coverage and low SNR. Recent studies showed that, with deep convolutional
neural networks, isotropic HR MR images could be recovered from low-resolution
(LR) input via single image super-resolution (SISR) algorithms. However, most
existing SISR methods tend to approach a scale-specific projection between LR
and HR images, thus these methods can only deal with a fixed up-sampling rate.
For achieving different up-sampling rates, multiple SR networks have to be
built up respectively, which is very time-consuming and resource-intensive. In
this paper, we propose ArSSR, an Arbitrary Scale Super-Resolution approach for
recovering 3D HR MR images. In the ArSSR model, the reconstruction of HR images
with different up-scaling rates is defined as learning a continuous implicit
voxel function from the observed LR images. Then the SR task is converted to
represent the implicit voxel function via deep neural networks from a set of
paired HR-LR training examples. The ArSSR model consists of an encoder network
and a decoder network. Specifically, the convolutional encoder network is to
extract feature maps from the LR input images and the fully-connected decoder
network is to approximate the implicit voxel function. Due to the continuity of
the learned function, a single ArSSR model can achieve arbitrary up-sampling

realize high-fidelity simulations of the compressible flow, especially the
cases with broadband length scales. It has been recognized that the
minimization of dispersion error is an effective method to improve the
precision. In addition, the proper dissipation of a scheme is important to
restrain the non-physics oscillations and reserve details of flows
simultaneously. The authors have previously proposed a scale sensor to adjust
the numerical dissipation of a fourth-order finite difference scheme according
to the local scale of the flow. In this paper, the scale sensor is further
modified for the sixth-order finite difference scheme to achieve minimized
dispersion and adaptive dissipation properties. Firstly, the scale sensor
quantifies the local length scale of the numerical solution as the effective
scaled wavenumber. Then, the dispersion-dissipation condition is used to
construct the relationship between the dissipation/dispersion parameter and the
effective scaled wavenumber. Therefore, a sixth-order finite difference scheme
with minimized dispersion and adaptive dissipation (MDAD6th) is proposed.
Several benchmark test cases with broadband length scales are presented to
clarify the high resolution of the new scheme.

optimizing the structure or adding new functional modules of the U-Net, which

semantic information from coarse to fine granularity without introducing
additional parameters; (2) EPL divides the training process into two ""stages""
to optimize parameters, and realizes the fusion of coarse-grained information

evaluate our method in different medical image analysis tasks, and the results
show that the segmentation performance of PL-Net is better than the

use a drift-diffusion-reaction fluid model with the local field approximation
and a PIC-MCC (particle-in-cell, Monte Carlo collision) particle model. The
simulations are performed at 300 K and 1 bar in a 10 mm plate-plate gap with a
2 mm needle electrode. Applied voltages between 11.7 and 15.6 kV are used,
which correspond to background fields of about 15 to 20 kV/cm. Streamer
properties like maximal electric field, head position and velocity are compared
as a function of time or space.
  Our results show good agreement between the particle and fluid simulations,
in contrast to some earlier comparisons that were carried out in 1D or for
negative streamers. To quantify discrepancies between the models, we mainly
look at streamer velocities as a function of streamer length. For the test
cases considered here, the mean deviation in streamer velocity between the
particle and fluid simulations is less than 4%. We study the effect of
different types of transport data for the fluid model, and find that flux
coefficients lead to good agreement whereas bulk coefficients do not.
Furthermore, we find that with a two-term Boltzmann solver, data should be
computed using a temporal growth model for the best agreement. The numerical
convergence of the particle and fluid models is also studied. In fluid
simulations the streamer velocity increases somewhat using finer grids, whereas
the particle simulations are less sensitive to the grid. Photoionization is the
dominant source of stochastic fluctuations in our simulations. When the same
stochastic photoionization model is used, particle and fluid simulations
exhibit similar fluctuations.

which has been successfully used as an iterative solver and as a preconditioner
for discretized Helmholtz boundary-value problems. In this paper, we give, for
the first time, a convergence analysis for ORAS as an iterative solver -- and
also as a preconditioner -- for nodal finite element Helmholtz systems of any
polynomial order. The analysis starts by showing (for general domain
decompositions) that ORAS as an unconventional finite element approximation of
a classical parallel iterative Schwarz method, formulated at the PDE
(non-discrete) level. This non-discrete Schwarz method was recently analysed in
[Gong, Gander, Graham, Lafontaine, Spence, arXiv 2106.05218], and the present
paper gives a corresponding discrete version of this analysis. In particular,
for domain decompositions in strips in 2-d, we show that, when the mesh size is
small enough, ORAS inherits the convergence properties of the Schwarz method,
independent of polynomial order. The proof relies on characterising the ORAS
iteration in terms of discrete `impedance-to-impedance maps', which we prove
(via a novel weighted finite-element error analysis) converge as $h\rightarrow

the vertex cover size. This generalizes a similar result for \ecp and
immediately extends to the \bocp, which was earlier not known.

bipartite graphs when $c>3$, the result follows for \bcp as well. We provide a

motivated from the observed oscillations of the light neutrinos and they have
shown to successfully explain the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU)
through, for instance, the so-called ARS leptogenesis. Sterile neutrinos can be
added in minimal ways to the SM, but many theories exist where sterile
neutrinos are not the only new fields. Such theories often include scalar
bosons, which brings about the possibility of further interactions between the
sterile neutrinos and the SM. In this paper we consider an extension of the SM
with two sterile neutrinos and one scalar singlet particle and investigate the
effect that an additional, thermalised, scalar has on the ARS leptogenesis
mechanism. We show that in general the created asymmetry is reduced due to
additional sterile neutrino production from scalar decays. When sterile
neutrinos and scalars are discovered in the laboratory, our results will
provide information on the applicability of the ARS leptogenesis mechanism.

construct an effective Lagrangian of the CS boson interaction with quarks of
two different flavors. This interaction is given by a divergent loop diagram,
however, it turns out that the divergent part is equal to zero as a consequence
of the CKM matrix unitarity in the SM. Therefore, we are able to predict the
effective interaction of the CS boson with quarks of different flavors without
introducing new unknown parameters to the model, using only parameters of the
initial effective Lagrangian. Our result shows that the effective interaction
of the CS boson with down-type quarks is sufficiently stronger compared with
up-type quarks. Based on our results, we give a prediction for the production
of CS bosons in mesons decays. Branching fractions were obtained for the main
reactions of the CS production in meson decays. The results obtained will be
useful for searching for the long-lived GeV-scale CS boson in intensity

XVII Modave summer school in mathematical physics, aimed at Ph.D. students in
high-energy theoretical physics.
  The manuscript starts by briefly stating Goldstone's theorem and emphasises
the motivations behind Goldstone physics; the main asset being the universality
of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) which is the fundamental hypothesis of
Goldstone's theorem. Once the different notions of SSB will be
clarified/reviewed, Goldstone's theorem will be stated and proved. A prediction
of this theorem is the existence of gapless particles, called Nambu-Goldstone
modes (NG modes). From the discussion on Goldstone's results, some aspects of
the NG modes will emerge. Besides to be gapless, they are systematically weakly
coupled at low energy. Therefore, an effective field theory (EFT) building tool
called ``coset construction'' will be presented to explicitly display these
specific features of the NG modes. The coset construction suits our goal since
it is mainly based on the symmetry realisation of the perturbed theory around
the background inducing SSB. From the general obtained EFT, a counting rule for
the NG modes will be derived. The limitations of this rule as well as the still
ongoing generalisation will be discussed (e.g. spacetime symmetry breaking).
The tools developed during this course will be illustrated with a concrete
example in physics: ferromagnetism. The notes end with a brief state of the art
of Goldstone physics. This provides some directions into which the interested
reader could investigate to expand his knowledge on the subject.

high-speed single-mode homodyne detection with low electronic noise at room
temperature. Together with continuous-variable information encoding to
nonclassical states, the distance for secure key transmission through lossy
channels can approach 300 km in current optical fibers. Such protocols tolerate
higher channel noise and also limited data processing efficiency compared to
coherent-state protocols. The secret key rate can be further increased by
increasing the system clock rates, and, further, by a suitable
frequency-mode-multiplexing of optical transmission channels. However, the
multiplexed modes couple together in the source or any other part of the
protocol. Therefore, multiplexed communication will experience crosstalk and
the gain can be minuscule. Advantageously, homodyne detectors allow solving
this crosstalk problem by proper data processing. It is a potential advantage
over protocols with single-photon detectors, which do not enable similar data
processing techniques. We demonstrate the positive outcome of this methodology
on the experimentally characterized frequency-multiplexed entangled source of
femtosecond optical pulses with natural crosstalk between eight entangled pairs
of modes. As the main result, we predict almost 15-fold higher secret key rate.
This experimental test and analysis of frequency-multiplexed entanglement

supervised learning that requires abundant amounts of training data. However,
collecting well-labeled training data becomes expensive when the data from many

address these challenges, we present AdaMEL, a deep transfer learning framework

through an attribute-level self-attention mechanism, and leverages the massive
unlabeled data from new data sources through domain adaptation to make it

incorporating an additional set of labeled data to more accurately integrate
data sources with different attribute importance. Extensive experiments show
that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results with 8.21% improvement on
average over methods based on supervised learning. Besides, it is more stable
in handling different sets of data sources in less runtime.

strategy based on information perturbation. The idea is to perturb information
in the original input signal (e.g., formant, pitch, and frequency response),
thereby letting synthesis networks selectively take essential attributes to
reconstruct the input signal. Because NANSY does not need any bottleneck
structures, it enjoys both high reconstruction quality and controllability.
Furthermore, NANSY does not require any labels associated with speech data such
as text and speaker information, but rather uses a new set of analysis
features, i.e., wav2vec feature and newly proposed pitch feature, Yingram,
which allows for fully self-supervised training. Taking advantage of fully
self-supervised training, NANSY can be easily extended to a multilingual

that NANSY can achieve significant improvement in performance in several

impacted regions. Usually human experts are needed to manually label the
degrees of the building damage so that proper humanitarian assistance and
disaster response (HADR) can be achieved, which is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. Expecting human labeling of major disasters over a wide area
gravely slows down the HADR efforts. It is thus of crucial interest to take
advantage of the cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
techniques to speed up the natural infrastructure damage assessment process to
achieve effective HADR. Accordingly, the paper demonstrates a systematic effort
to achieve efficient building damage classification. First, two novel
generative adversarial nets (GANs) are designed to augment data used to train
the deep-learning-based classifier. Second, a contrastive learning based method
using novel data structures is developed to achieve great performance. Third,
by using information fusion, the classifier is effectively trained with very
few training data samples for transfer learning. All the classifiers are small
enough to be loaded in a smart phone or simple laptop for first responders.
Based on the available overhead imagery dataset, results demonstrate data and
computational efficiency with 10% of the collected data combined with a GAN
reducing the time of computation from roughly half a day to about 1 hour with
roughly similar classification performances.

inverse-probability-weighted and doubly robust estimation using propensity
scores, is a standard tool in causal inference, and it is rapidly being
extended in various directions. On the other hand, although model selection is
indispensable in statistical analysis, an information criterion for selecting
an appropriate regression structure has just started to be developed. In this
paper, based on the original definition of Akaike information criterion (AIC;
\citealt{Aka73}), we derive an AIC-type criterion for propensity score
analysis. Here, we define a risk function based on the Kullback-Leibler
divergence as the cornerstone of the information criterion and treat a general
causal inference model that is not necessarily a linear one. The causal effects
to be estimated are those in the general population, such as the average
treatment effect on the treated or the average treatment effect on the
untreated. In light of the fact that this field attaches importance to doubly
robust estimation, which allows either the model of the assignment variable or
the model of the outcome variable to be wrong, we make the information
criterion itself doubly robust so that either one can be wrong and it will
still be an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the risk function. In
simulation studies, we compare the derived criterion with an existing criterion
obtained from a formal argument and confirm that the former outperforms the
latter. Specifically, we check that the divergence between the estimated
structure from the derived criterion and the true structure is clearly small in
all simulation settings and that the probability of selecting the true or
nearly true model is clearly higher. Real data analyses confirm that the
results of variable selection using the two criteria differ significantly.

community and policymakers, since forecasts can provide insight into disease
dynamics in the near future and inform interventions. Due to delays in case
reporting, however, forecasting models may often underestimate the current and
future disease burden.
  In this paper, we propose a general framework for addressing reporting delay
in disease forecasting efforts with the goal of improving forecasts. We propose
strategies for leveraging either historical data on case reporting or external
internet-based data to estimate the amount of reporting error. We then describe
several approaches for adapting general forecasting pipelines to account for
under- or over-reporting of cases. We apply these methods to address reporting
delay in data on dengue fever cases in Puerto Rico from 1990 to 2009 and to
reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States between 2010 and
2019. Through a simulation study, we compare method performance and evaluate
robustness to assumption violations. Our results show that forecasting accuracy
and prediction coverage almost always increase when correction methods are
implemented to address reporting delay. Some of these methods required
knowledge about the reporting error or high quality external data, which may
not always be available. Provided alternatives include excluding
recently-reported data and performing sensitivity analysis. This work provides
intuition and guidance for handling delay in disease case reporting and may
serve as a useful resource to inform practical infectious disease forecasting
efforts.

order to reconcile analytical and numerical approaches, finite-size KBI have
been proposed in the literature, resulting in two strategies to obtain their TL
values from computer simulations. (i) The spatial block-analysis method in
which the simulation box is divided into subdomains of volume $V$ to compute
fluctuations of the number of particles. (ii) A direct integration method where
a corrected radial distribution function and a kernel that accounts for the
geometry of the integration subvolumes are combined to obtain KBI as a function
of $V$. In this work, we propose a method that connects both strategies into a
single framework. We start from the definition of finite-size KBI, including
the integration subdomain and an asymptotic correction to the radial
distribution function, and solve them in Fourier space where periodic boundary
conditions are trivially introduced. The limit $q\to 0$, equivalent to the
value of the KBI in the TL, is obtained via the spatial block-analysis method.
When compared to the latter, our approach gives nearly identical results for
all values of $V$. Moreover, all finite-size effect contributions (ensemble,
finite-integration domains and periodic boundary conditions) are easily
identifiable in the calculation. This feature allows us to analyse finite-size
effects independently and extrapolate the results of a single simulation to
different box sizes. To validate our approach, we investigate prototypical

have increased explosively. Many emojis are used to express emotions,
attitudes, and opinions. Emoji representation learning can be helpful to
improve the performance of emoji-related natural language processing tasks,
especially in text sentiment analysis. However, most studies have only utilized
the fixed descriptions provided by the Unicode Consortium without consideration
of actual usage scenarios. As for the sentiment analysis task, many researchers
ignore the emotional impact of the interaction between text and emojis. It
results that the emotional semantics of emojis cannot be fully explored. In
this work, we propose a method called EmoGraph2vec to learn emoji
representations by constructing a co-occurrence graph network from social data
and enriching the semantic information based on an external knowledge base
EmojiNet to embed emoji nodes. Based on EmoGraph2vec model, we design a novel
neural network to incorporate text and emoji information into sentiment
analysis, which uses a hybrid-attention module combined with TextCNN-based
classifier to improve performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
model can outperform several baselines for sentiment analysis on benchmark
datasets. Additionally, we conduct a series of ablation and comparison
experiments to investigate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model.

many super-resolution (SR) and image restoration tasks. While many such
networks can upscale low-resolution (LR) images using just the raw pixel-level
information, the ill-posed nature of SR can make it difficult to accurately
super-resolve an image which has undergone multiple different degradations.
Additional information (metadata) describing the degradation process (such as
the blur kernel applied, compression level, etc.) can guide networks to
super-resolve LR images with higher fidelity to the original source. Previous
attempts at informing SR networks with degradation parameters have indeed been
able to improve performance in a number of scenarios. However, due to the
fully-convolutional nature of many SR networks, most of these metadata fusion
methods either require a complete architectural change, or necessitate the
addition of significant extra complexity. Thus, these approaches are difficult
to introduce into arbitrary SR networks without considerable design
alterations. In this paper, we introduce meta-attention, a simple mechanism
which allows any SR CNN to exploit the information available in relevant
degradation parameters. The mechanism functions by translating the metadata
into a channel attention vector, which in turn selectively modulates the
network's feature maps. Incorporating meta-attention into SR networks is
straightforward, as it requires no specific type of architecture to function
correctly. Extensive testing has shown that meta-attention can consistently
improve the pixel-level accuracy of state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks when
provided with relevant degradation metadata. For PSNR, the gain on
blurred/downsampled (X4) images is of 0.2969 dB (on average) and 0.3320 dB for
SOTA general and face SR models, respectively.

imitates the behavior of a pre-trained teacher in a target domain. Prior KD
approaches, despite their gratifying results, have largely relied on the
premise that \emph{in-domain} data is available to carry out the knowledge
transfer. Such an assumption, unfortunately, in many cases violates the
practical setting, since the original training data or even the data domain is
often unreachable due to privacy or copyright reasons. In this paper, we
attempt to tackle an ambitious task, termed as \emph{out-of-domain} knowledge
distillation~(OOD-KD), which allows us to conduct KD using only OOD data that
can be readily obtained at a very low cost. Admittedly, OOD-KD is by nature a
highly challenging task due to the agnostic domain gap. To this end, we
introduce a handy yet surprisingly efficacious approach, dubbed
as~\textit{MosaicKD}. The key insight behind MosaicKD lies in that, samples
from various domains share common local patterns, even though their global
semantic may vary significantly; these shared local patterns, in turn, can be
re-assembled analogous to mosaic tiling, to approximate the in-domain data and
to further alleviating the domain discrepancy. In MosaicKD, this is achieved
through a four-player min-max game, in which a generator, a discriminator, a
student network, are collectively trained in an adversarial manner, partially
under the guidance of a pre-trained teacher. We validate MosaicKD over
{classification and semantic segmentation tasks} across various benchmarks, and
demonstrate that it yields results much superior to the state-of-the-art
counterparts on OOD data. Our code is available at

strain engineering in ordered arrays of vertically close-stacked SiGe quantum
dot (QD) pairs. The strain induced by the respective lower QD creates a
preferential nucleation site for the upper one and strains the upper QD as well
as the Si cap above it. Electrons are confined in the strain pockets in the Si
cap, which leads to an enhanced wave function overlap with the heavy holes near
the upper QD's apex. With a thickness of the Si spacer between the stacked QDs
below 5 nm, we separated the functions of the two QDs: The role of the lower
one is that of a pure stressor, whereas only the upper QD facilitates radiative
recombination of QD-bound excitons. We report on the design and strain
engineering of the QD pairs via strain-dependent Schr\""odinger-Poisson

comprehensive study of their structural and optical properties in comparison

wetting layers is suppressed in the double-QD configuration.

architecture search (NAS) technique based on genetic algorithm (GA), NAS-G, to
search for the best CNN architecture. Firstly, we attach each kernel with an
adaptive coefficient to enhance the signal processing of the inputs. This can
enhance the propagation of informative features and suppress the propagation of
useless features in the early stage of the network. Then, we make full use of
GA's heuristic search and the advantage of no need for the gradient to search
for the best architecture of CNN. This can achieve a CNN with better
performance than a handcrafted one in a large search space at the minimum cost.
We verify the convergence of our data processing trick and compare the
performance of traditional CNNs before and after using our trick. Meanwhile, we
compare the performance between the CNN generated through NAS-G and the
traditional CNNs with our trick. The experiments demonstrate that the
convergence of CNNs with data processing trick is faster than without data

outperforms the handcrafted counterparts that use the data processing trick
too.

  Objective: In this paper, we aim to learn robust vector representations from
massive unlabeled EEG signals, such that the learned vectorized features (1)
are expressive enough to replace the raw signals in the sleep staging task; and
(2) provide better predictive performance than supervised models in scenarios
of fewer labels and noisy samples.
  Methods: We propose a self-supervised model, named Contrast with the World
Representation (ContraWR), for EEG signal representation learning, which uses
global statistics from the dataset to distinguish signals associated with
different sleep stages. The ContraWR model is evaluated on three real-world EEG
datasets that include both at-home and in-lab EEG recording settings.
  Results: ContraWR outperforms 4 recent self-supervised learning methods on
the sleep staging task across 3 large EEG datasets. ContraWR also beats
supervised learning when fewer training labels are available (e.g., 4% accuracy
improvement when less than 2% data is labeled). Moreover, the model provides
informative representative feature structures in 2D projection.
  Conclusions: We show that ContraWR is robust to noise and can provide
high-quality EEG representations for downstream prediction tasks. The proposed
model can be generalized to other unsupervised physiological signal learning
tasks. Future directions include exploring task-specific data augmentations and
combining self-supervised with supervised methods, building upon the initial
success of self-supervised learning in this paper.

technique widely applied across many science and engineering disciplines to
perform non-intrusive gas diagnostics. CARS is often used to study combustion,
where the measured spectra can be used to simultaneously recover multiple flow
parameters from the reacting gas such as temperature and relative species mole
fractions. This is typically done by using numerical optimization to find the
flow parameters for which a theoretical model of the CARS spectra best matches
the actual measurements. The most commonly used theoretical model is the CARSFT
spectrum calculator. Unfortunately, this CARSFT spectrum generator is
computationally expensive and using it to recover multiple flow parameters can
be prohibitively time-consuming, especially when experiments have hundreds or
thousands of measurements distributed over time or space. To overcome these
issues, several methods have been developed to approximate CARSFT using a
library of pre-computed theoretical spectra. In this work we present a new
approach that leverages ideas from the machine learning literature to build an
adaptively smoothed kernel-based approximator. In application on a simulated
dual-pump CARS experiment probing a $H_2/$air flame, we show that the approach
can use a small number library spectra to quickly and accurately recover
temperature and four gas species' mole fractions. The method's flexibility
allows fine-tuned navigation of the trade-off between speed and accuracy, and
makes the approach suitable for a wide range of problems and flow regimes.

biological plausibility, which has made it an attractive machine learning
framework for edge and neuromorphic computing paradigms. Originally proposed as
a model of brain computation, the LSM tunes its internal weights without
backpropagation of gradients, which results in lower performance compared to
multi-layer neural networks. Recent findings in neuroscience suggest that
astrocytes, a long-neglected non-neuronal brain cell, modulate synaptic
plasticity and brain dynamics, tuning brain networks to the vicinity of the
computationally optimal critical phase transition between order and chaos.
Inspired by this disruptive understanding of how brain networks self-tune, we
propose the neuron-astrocyte liquid state machine (NALSM) that addresses
under-performance through self-organized near-critical dynamics. Similar to its
biological counterpart, the astrocyte model integrates neuronal activity and
provides global feedback to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which
self-organizes NALSM dynamics around a critical branching factor that is
associated with the edge-of-chaos. We demonstrate that NALSM achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy versus comparable LSM methods, without the need for
data-specific hand-tuning. With a top accuracy of 97.61% on MNIST, 97.51% on
N-MNIST, and 85.84% on Fashion-MNIST, NALSM achieved comparable performance to
current fully-connected multi-layer spiking neural networks trained via

present two reactive percolation experiments performed on a natural

fast and dramatic decrease of the permeability for both experiments principally
due to the precipitation of carbonates. On the contrary, serpentine was found
to be less impacting as it precipitates in low-flow zones, out of the main
percolation paths. In total, about 5.6% of the total injected CO2 was retained
in the core, at 280{\deg}C. In the same time, hydrogen was consistently

serpentine is much slower to react and gets altered only if the activity of
