Most existing deep hashing approaches adopt one-to-one quantization to reduce
information loss. However, such class-unrelated quantization cannot give
discriminative feedback for network training. In addition, these methods only
utilize single label to integrate supervision information of data for hashing
function learning, which may result in inferior network generalization
performance and relatively low-quality hash codes since the inter-class
information of data is totally ignored. In this paper, we propose a dual
semantic asymmetric hashing (DSAH) method, which generates discriminative hash
codes under three-fold constraints. Firstly, DSAH utilizes class prior to
conduct class structure quantization so as to transmit class information during
the quantization process. Secondly, a simple yet effective label mechanism is
designed to characterize both the intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability of data, thereby achieving semantic-sensitive binary code
learning. Finally, a meaningful pairwise similarity preserving loss is devised
to minimize the distances between class-related network outputs based on an
affinity graph. With these three main components, high-quality hash codes can
be generated through network. Extensive experiments conducted on various
datasets demonstrate the superiority of DSAH in comparison with
state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.

flat-band phenomena. In this paper, we investigate flat-band plasmons in the
hole-doped twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ (tb-MoS$_2$) by employing a full
tight-binding model and the random phase approximation. When considering
lattice relaxations in tb-MoS$_2$, the flat band is not separated from remote
valence bands, which makes the contribution of interband transitions in
transforming the plasmon dispersion and energy significantly different. In
particular, low-damped and quasi-flat plasmons emerge if we only consider
intraband transitions in the doped flat band, whereas a $\sqrt q$ plasmon
dispersion emerges if we also take into account interband transitions between
the flat band and remote bands. Furthermore, the plasmon energies are tunable
with twist angles and doping levels. However, in a rigid sample that suffers no
lattice relaxations, lower-energy quasi-flat plasmons and higher-energy
interband plasmons can coexist. For rigid tb-MoS$_2$ with a high doping level,
strongly enhanced interband transitions quench the quasi-flat plasmons. Based
on the lattice relaxation and doping effects, we conclude that two conditions,
the isolated flat band and a properly hole-doping level, are essential for
observing the low-damped and quasi-flat plasmon mode in twisted bilayer
transition metal dichalcogenides. We hope that our study on flat-band plasmons
can be instructive for studying the possibility of plasmon-mediated
superconductivity in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the

  near-restriction multilinear estimates without transversality",,,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new approach to the Fourier restriction conjectures. It is based
on a discretization of the Fourier extension operators in terms of
quadratically modulated wave packets. Using this new point of view, and by
combining natural scalar and mixed norm quantities from appropriate level sets,
we prove that all the $L^{2}$-based $k$-linear extension conjectures are true
up to the endpoint for every $1 \leq k \leq d+1$ if one of the functions
involved is a full tensor. We also introduce the concept of \textit{weak
transversality}, under which we show that all conjectured $L^{2}$-based
multilinear extension estimates are still true up to the endpoint provided that
one of the functions involved has a weaker tensor structure, and we prove that
this result is sharp. Under additional tensor hypotheses, we show that one can
improve the conjectured threshold of these problems in some cases. In general,
the largely unknown multilinear extension theory beyond $L^{2}$ inputs remains
open even in the bilinear case; with this new point of view, and still under
the previous tensor hypothesis, we obtain the near-restriction target for the
$k$-linear extension operator if the inputs are in a certain $L^{p}$ space for
$p$ sufficiently large. The proof of this result is adapted to show that the
$k$-fold product of linear extension operators (no transversality assumed) also
``maps near restriction"" if one input is a tensor. Finally, we exploit the
connection between the geometric features behind the results of this paper and
the theory of Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, which allows us to verify a special

because commodity machines may not have enough memory to accommodate both the
model and a large data batch size. The batch size is one of the
hyper-parameters used in the training model, and it is dependent on and is
limited by the target machine memory capacity because the batch size can only
fit into the remaining memory after the model is uploaded. Moreover, the data
item size is also an important factor because if each data item size is larger
then the batch size that can fit into the remaining memory becomes smaller.
This paper proposes a framework called Micro-Batch Streaming (MBS) to address
this problem. This method helps deep learning models to train by providing a
batch streaming method that splits a batch into a size that can fit in the
remaining memory and streams them sequentially. A loss normalization algorithm
based on the gradient accumulation is used to maintain the performance. The
purpose of our method is to allow deep learning models to train using larger
batch sizes that exceed the memory capacity of a system without increasing the
memory size or using multiple devices (GPUs).

that converged for increasing $M$, but the Neumann type produced eigenvalues
for the same structures that approached two different limits as $M$ increased.
This last behavior is unexpected, as it implies a dependence upon the type of
film end layer.

integrated with the ultra-thin oxide (UO) tunneling interfacial layer has been
systematically investigated. Si nanomembranes (NMs) were oxidized in different
time periods prior to the hetero-integration process to create the non-ideal
single-side passivated Si/GaAs heterostructure. The atomic level oxygen
distribution and the degree of oxygen content in Si NM and GaAs were carefully
investigated using the atom probe tomography (APT) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) to trace the changes in chemical composition and reactional
mechanism across the UO interface when the surface of Si NM was exposed to air
for different period of time. The negatively induced charges at the UO layer
caused the oxygen diffusion to GaAs layer and formed the unwanted GaAs oxide
layer. This native oxide stack noticeably degraded the thermal properties of
the Si/GaAs heterostructure as Si NMs were more oxidized. This study revealed
that the poor surface passivation on the one side of the heterointerface leads
to a both-side oxidation, thus severely deteriorating the transport properties
across the heterojunction that is formed with the UO layer.

elections, we consider the problem of public good allocation: Given a set of
indivisible projects (or candidates) of different sizes, and voters with
different monotone utility functions over subsets of these candidates, the goal
is to choose a budget-constrained subset of these candidates (or a committee)
that provides fair utility to the voters. The notion of fairness we adopt is
that of core stability from cooperative game theory: No subset of voters should
be able to choose another blocking committee of proportionally smaller size
that provides strictly larger utility to all voters that deviate. The core
provides a strong notion of fairness, subsuming other notions that have been
widely studied in computational social choice.
  It is well-known that an exact core need not exist even when utility
functions of the voters are additive across candidates. We therefore relax the
problem to allow approximation: Voters can only deviate to the blocking
committee if after they choose any extra candidate (called an additament),
their utility still increases by an $\alpha$ factor. If no blocking committee
exists under this definition, we call this an $\alpha$-core.
  Our main result is that an $\alpha$-core, for $\alpha < 67.37$, always exists
when utilities of the voters are arbitrary monotone submodular functions, and
this can be computed in polynomial time. This result improves to $\alpha <
9.27$ for additive utilities, albeit without the polynomial time guarantee. Our
results are a significant improvement over prior work that only shows
logarithmic approximations for the case of additive utilities. We complement
our results with a lower bound of $\alpha > 1.015$ for submodular utilities,
and a lower bound of any function in the number of voters and candidates for
general monotone utilities.

  We suggest a new approach to detecting change in the data distribution by

remain stable if the data distribution does not change. We thus use a set of
learned strong polynomial relations to identify drift. For a set of polynomial

drift observed for that relation. The amount of drift is measured by
calculating the Bayes Factor for the polynomial relation likelihood of the

  Though there exist several imaging methods and grading criteria for
quantifying collateral blood flow, the actual grading is mostly done through
manual inspection of the acquired images. This approach is associated with a
number of challenges. First, it is time-consuming - the clinician needs to scan
through several slices of images to ascertain the region of interest before
deciding on what severity grade to assign to a patient. Second, there is a high

learning problem and train a deep learning network to automatically detect the
occluded region within the 3D MR perfusion volumes. Second, we extract radiomic
features from the obtained region of interest through local image descriptors

constructs the hierarchy in an increasing order of subgraph density. They
iteratively peel the entities with minimum butterfly count i.e. remove them
from the graph and update the butterfly count of other entities. However, the
amount of butterflies in large bipartite graphs makes bottom-up peeling
computationally demanding. Furthermore, the strict order of peeling entities
results in a numerous sequentially dependent iterations, which makes
parallelization challenging.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Parallel Bipartite Network peelinG (PBNG)
framework which adopts a two-phased peeling approach to relax the order of
peeling, and in turn, reduce synchronization. The first phase divides the
decomposition hierarchy into several partitions using very few peeling
iterations. The second phase concurrently processes these partitions to
generate the final hierarchy, and requires no global synchronization. The
two-phased peeling further enables batching optimizations that dramatically
improve the computational efficiency.
  We empirically evaluate PBNG using several real-world bipartite graphs.
Compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks and decomposition algorithms, PBNG
achieves up to four orders of magnitude reduction in synchronization and two
orders of magnitude speedup, respectively. We also present the first

  Modeling",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Missing data theory deals with the statistical methods in the occurrence of
missing data. Missing data occurs when some values are not stored or observed
for variables of interest. However, most of the statistical theory assumes that
data is fully observed. An alternative to deal with incomplete databases is to
fill in the spaces corresponding to the missing information based on some
criteria, this technique is called imputation. We introduce a new imputation
methodology for databases with univariate missing patterns based on additional
information from fully-observed auxiliary variables. We assume that the
non-observed variable is continuous, and that auxiliary variables assist to
improve the imputation capacity of the model. In a fully Bayesian framework,
our method uses a flexible mixture of multivariate normal distributions to
model the response and the auxiliary variables jointly. Under this framework,
we use the properties of Gaussian Cluster-Weighted modeling to construct a
predictive model to impute the missing values using the information from the
covariates. Simulations studies and a real data illustration are presented to
show the method imputation capacity under a variety of scenarios and in
comparison to other literature methods.

processes. In this work, our main tool is perturbation theory of strongly
continuous semigroups. The advantage of this technique is that one can provide
functional evolution equations with the explicit representation formulas of the
solution. First, we introduce a closed form of the fundamental solution of the
evolution equation with a discrete delay using the delayed Dyson-Phillips
series. Then we set up the analytical representation formulas of the classical
solutions of linear homogeneous/non-homogeneous evolution equations with a
constant delay in a Banach space. In the special case, when a strongly
continuous group $\left\lbrace \mathcal{T}(t)\right\rbrace_{t\in \mathbb{R}}$
commutes with a bounded linear operator $A_{1}$, we obtain an elegant formula
for the fundamental solution using the powers of the resolvent operator of
$A_{0}$.
  Furthermore, we consider delay evolution equations with
permutable/non-permutable linear bounded operators and derive crucial results
in terms of non-commutative analysis. Finally, we present an example, in the
context of a one-dimensional heat equation with a discrete delay to demonstrate
the applicability of our theoretical results and give some comparisons with
existing results.

  Distillation","Accepted to BMVC 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel method, X-Distill, to improve the
self-supervised training of monocular depth via cross-task knowledge
distillation from semantic segmentation to depth estimation. More specifically,
during training, we utilize a pretrained semantic segmentation teacher network
and transfer its semantic knowledge to the depth network. In order to enable
such knowledge distillation across two different visual tasks, we introduce a
small, trainable network that translates the predicted depth map to a semantic
segmentation map, which can then be supervised by the teacher network. In this
way, this small network enables the backpropagation from the semantic
segmentation teacher's supervision to the depth network during training. In
addition, since the commonly used object classes in semantic segmentation are
not directly transferable to depth, we study the visual and geometric
characteristics of the objects and design a new way of grouping them that can
be shared by both tasks. It is noteworthy that our approach only modifies the
training process and does not incur additional computation during inference. We
extensively evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach on the standard
KITTI benchmark and compare it with the latest state of the art. We further
test the generalizability of our approach on Make3D. Overall, the results show
that our approach significantly improves the depth estimation accuracy and
outperforms the state of the art.

that the developed system allows users to operate the robot smoother, which
leads to a decrease in task execution time when manipulating test tubes. In
addition, the participants evaluated the developed system as less mentally

combine the power of data with the classical convex regularization theory.
Specifically, we leverage the variational source condition (SC) during training
to enforce that the ground-truth images minimize the variational loss
corresponding to the learned convex regularizer. This is achieved by adding an
appropriate penalty term to the ACR training objective. The resulting
regularizer (abbreviated as ACR-SC) performs on par with the ACR, but unlike
ACR, comes with a quantitative convergence rate estimate.

solve downstream geospatial computer vision tasks. Tiles resulting from a
raster representation of the earth's surface are modeled as nodes on a graph or
pixels of an image. GPS trajectories are modeled as allowed Markovian paths on
these nodes. A scalable and distributed algorithm is presented to compute
image-like tensors, called reachability summaries, of the spatial connectivity
patterns between tiles and their neighbors implied by the observed Markovian
paths. A convolutional, contractive autoencoder is trained to learn compressed

representations for five different downstream geospatial tasks, cast as
supervised semantic segmentation problems, we quantitatively demonstrate that
reachability embeddings are semantically meaningful representations and result
in 4-23% gain in performance, while using upto 67% less trajectory data, as

models by integrating observation and numerical simulation. For many
applications in earth system sciences, an optimization method which allows
parameters to temporally change is required. In the present paper, an efficient
and practical method to estimate the time-varying parameters of relatively low
dimensional models is presented. In the newly proposed method, called Hybrid
Offline Online Parameter Estimation with Particle Filtering (HOOPE-PF), an
inflation method to maintain the spread of ensemble members in a
sampling-importance-resampling particle filter is improved using a
non-parametric posterior probabilistic distribution of time-invariant
parameters obtained by comparing simulated and observed climatology. The
HOOPE-PF outperforms the original sampling-importance-resampling particle
filter in synthetic experiments with toy models and a real-data experiment with
a conceptual hydrological model especially when the ensemble size is small. The
advantage of HOOPE-PF is that its performance is not greatly affected by the
size of perturbation to be added to ensemble members to maintain their spread
while it is critically important to get the optimal performance in the original
particle filter. Since HOOPE-PF is the extension of the existing particle
filter which has been extensively applied to many earth system models such as
land, ecosystem, hydrology, and paleoclimate reconstruction, the HOOPE-PF can
be applied to improve the simulation of these earth system models by
considering time-varying model parameters.

that A-unital channels are precisely the completely free operations for the

problem. This paper focuses on primal heuristics used with Dantzig-Wolfe
decomposition. We propose two primal heuristics: one based on decomposition and
one based on machine learning. The first one uses the fractional solution to
the restricted master problem to fix a subset of the integer variables. In each
iteration of the column generation procedure, the primal heuristic obtains the
fractional solution, checks whether each binary variable satisfies the
integrality constraint and fix those which do. The remaining variables are then
optimised quickly by a solver to find a feasible, near-optimal solution to the
original instance. The other primal heuristic based on machine learning is of
interest when the problems are to be solved repeatedly with different demand
data but with the same problem structure. The primal heuristic uses a
pre-trained neural network to fix a subset of the integer variables. In the
training phase, a neural network is trained to predict for any demand data and
for each binary variable how likely it is that the variable takes each of two
possible values. After the training, given an instance to be solved, the
prediction of the model is used with a rounding threshold to fix some binary
variables. Our numerical experiments compare our methods with solving the
undecomposed problem and also with other primal heuristics from the literature.
The experiments reveal that the primal heuristic based on machine learning is
superior when the suboptimality tolerance is relatively large, such as 0.5% or
0.25%, while the decomposition is the best when the tolerance is small, for
example 0.1%.

provide a trustworthy, secure, and cost-effective mechanism to manage the
auction process; on the other hand, auction models can be utilized to design

opportunities have attracted enormous research and innovation activities in
both academia and industry; however, there is a lack of an in-depth review of

effects associated with quasi-BICs in the simplest structures, where quasi-BICs
are very pronounced. An example is a dielectric cylinder, and in a number of
works, quasi-BICs have been studied both in single cylinders and in structures
composed of cylinders. In this work, we studied the properties of quasi-BICs
during the transition from a homogeneous dielectric cylinder in an air
environment to a ring with narrow walls while increasing the diameter of the
inner air cylinder gradually. The results demonstrate the quasi-BIC crossover
from the strong-coupling to the weak-coupling regime, which manifests itself in
the transition from avoided crossing of branches to their intersection with the
quasi-BIC being preserved on only one straight branch. In the regime of
strong-coupling and quasi-BIC, three waves interfere in the far-field zone: two
waves corresponding to the resonant modes of the structure and the wave
scattered by the structure as a whole. The validity of the Fano resonance
concept is discussed, since it describes the interference of only two waves
under weak coupling conditions.

the notion of the digital twin to capture the relationship between a real-world

permit off-chain state persistence and on-chain state traceability, where the
container can be deployed on the blockchain as well as on traditional

data through artificial intelligence techniques. The aim is to predict whether
a magnetic active region (AR) will originate solar flares above a certain class
within a certain amount of time. A crucial issue is concerned with the way the
adopted machine learning method is implemented, since forecasting results
strongly depend on the criterion with which training, validation, and test sets
are populated. In this paper we propose a general paradigm to generate these
sets in such a way that they are independent from each other and internally
well-balanced in terms of AR flaring effectiveness. This set generation process
provides a ground for comparison for the performance assessment of machine
learning algorithms. Finally, we use this implementation paradigm in the case
of a deep neural network, which takes as input videos of magnetograms recorded
by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO/HMI). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the solar flare
forecasting problem is addressed by means of a deep neural network for video
classification, which does not require any a priori extraction of features from
the HMI magnetograms.

representing high-dimensional distributions with structure. Recent years have
also seen big advances in designing multi-item mechanisms. Akin to overfitting,

  We consider a natural class of multi-item mechanism design problems with very

estimating a multi-dimensional prior from the task of designing a good

realized utilities. The methodology developed successfully finds strategies

complex social phenomena. In a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, social
influence can determine whether life-saving information is adopted. Existing
literature studying online social influence suffers from several drawbacks.
First, a disconnect appears between psychology approaches, which are generally
performed and tested in controlled lab experiments, and the quantitative
methods, which are usually data-driven and rely on network and event analysis.
The former are slow, expensive to deploy, and typically do not generalize well
to topical issues (such as an ongoing pandemic); the latter often oversimplify
the complexities of social influence and ignore psychosocial literature. This
work bridges this gap and presents three contributions towards modeling and
empirically quantifying online influence. The first contribution is a
data-driven Generalized Influence Model that incorporates two novel
psychosocial-inspired mechanisms: the conductance of the diffusion network and
the social capital distribution. The second contribution is a framework to
empirically rank users' social influence using a human-in-the-loop active
learning method combined with crowdsourced pairwise influence comparisons. We
build a human-labeled ground truth, calibrate our generalized influence model
and perform a large-scale evaluation of influence. We find that our generalized
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches and corrects the
inherent biases introduced by the widely used follower count. As the third
contribution, we apply the influence model to discussions around COVID-19. We
quantify users' influence, and we tabulate it against their professions. We
find that the executives, media, and military are more influential than
pandemic-related experts such as life scientists and healthcare professionals.

parallel controlled qubits is a vital requirement for fault-tolerant quantum
computing. For superconducting quantum processors, though isolated one- or
two-qubit gates have been demonstrated with high-fidelity, implementing these
gates in parallel commonly shows worse performance. Generally, this degradation
is attributed to various crosstalks between qubits, such as quantum crosstalk
due to residual inter-qubit coupling. An understanding of the exact nature of
these crosstalks is critical to figuring out respective mitigation schemes and
improved qubit architecture designs with low crosstalk. Here we give a
theoretical analysis of quantum crosstalk impact on simultaneous gate
operations in a qubit architecture, where fixed-frequency transmon qubits are
coupled via a tunable bus, and sub-100-ns controlled-Z (CZ) gates can be
realized by applying a baseband flux pulse on the bus. Our analysis shows that
for microwave-driven single-qubit gates, the dressing from the qubit-qubit
coupling can cause non-negligible cross-driving errors when qubits operate near
frequency collision regions. During CZ gate operations, although unwanted
near-neighbor interactions are nominally turned off, sub-MHz parasitic
next-near-neighbor interactions involving spectator qubits can still exist,
causing considerable leakage or control error when one operates qubit systems
around these parasitic resonance points. To ensure high-fidelity simultaneous
operations, there could raise a request to figure out a better way to balance
the gate error from target qubit systems themselves and the error from
non-participating spectator qubits. Overall, our analysis suggests that towards
useful quantum processors, the qubit architecture should be examined carefully
in the context of high-fidelity simultaneous gate operations in a scalable
qubit lattice.

this research was to develop a computational algorithm that can be applied
across a broad range of ARA models; to the best of our knowledge, no such
algorithm currently exists. Using a two-person sequential model, we
incrementally increase the size of the model and develop a simulation-based
approximation of the true optimum where an exact solution is computationally
impractical. In particular, we begin with a relatively large decision space by
considering a theoretically continuous space that must be discretized. Then, we
incrementally increase the number of strategic objectives which causes the
decision space to grow exponentially. The problem is exacerbated by the
presence of an intelligent adversary who also must solve an exponentially large
decision problem according to some unknown decision-making process.
Nevertheless, using a stylized example that can be solved analytically we show
that our algorithm not only solves large ARA models quickly but also accurately
selects to the true optimal solution. Furthermore, the algorithm is
sufficiently general that it can be applied to any ARA model with a large, yet
finite, decision space.

as efficient if its relative error, namely the ratio between its standard
deviation and mean, is sufficiently controlled. It is widely known that when a
rare-event set contains multiple ""important regions"" encoded by the so-called
dominating points, IS needs to account for all of them via mixing to achieve
efficiency. We argue that in typical experiments, missing less significant
dominating points may not necessarily cause inefficiency, and the traditional
analysis recipe could suffer from intrinsic looseness by using relative error,
or in turn estimation variance, as an efficiency criterion. We propose a new
efficiency notion, which we call probabilistic efficiency, to tighten this gap.
In particular, we show that under the standard Gartner-Ellis large deviations
regime, an IS that uses only the most significant dominating points is
sufficient to attain this efficiency notion. Our finding is especially relevant
in high-dimensional settings where the computational effort to locate all
dominating points is enormous.

formalisation of these rules is needed. However, only recently this has been

allocation changes and opportunities for new failure modes arise. This
necessitates an approach to identify the safety requirements for the
increasingly autonomous system (IAS) as well as a framework and techniques to
verify and validate that an IAS meets its safety requirements. We use Crew
Resource Management techniques to identify requirements and behaviors for safe
human-machine teaming behaviors. We provide a methodology to verify that an IAS
meets its requirements. We apply the methodology to a case study in Urban Air
Mobility, which includes two contingency scenarios: unreliable sensor and
aborted landing. For this case study, we implement an IAS agent in the Soar
language that acts as a copilot for the selected contingency scenarios and
performs takeoff and landing preparation, while the pilot maintains final
decision authority. We develop a formal human-machine team architecture model
in the Architectural Analysis and Design Language (AADL), with operator and IAS
requirements formalized in the Assume Guarantee REasoning Environment (AGREE)
Annex to AADL. We formally verify safety requirements for the human-machine
team given the requirements on the IAS and operator. We develop an automated
translator from Soar to the nuXmv model checking language and formally verify
that the IAS agent satisfies its requirements using nuXmv. We share the design
and requirements errors found in the process as well as our lessons learned.

  eigenvalues and inviscid damping",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with the eigenvalues and linear inviscid damping of
the 2D capillary gravity water waves of finite depth $x_2\in(-h,0)$ linearized
at a monotone shear flow $U(x_2)$. Unlike the linearized Euler equation in a
fixed channel where eigenvalues exist only in low horizontal wave number $k$,
we first prove the linearized capillary gravity wave has two branches of
eigenvalues $-ikc^\pm(k)$, where the wave speeds $c^\pm(k)=O(\sqrt{|k|})$ for
$|k|\gg1$ have the same asymptotics as the those of the linear irrotational
capillary gravity waves. Under the additional assumption of $U""\ne0$, we obtain
the complete continuation of these two branches, which are all the eigenvalues
in this (and some other) case(s). Particularly $-ikc^-(k)$ could bifurcate into
unstable eigenvalues at $c^-(k)=U(-h)$. The bifurcation of unstable eigenvalues
from inflection values of $U$ is also proved. Assuming no singular modes, i.e.
no embedded eigenvalues for any wave number $k$, linear solutions
$(v(t,x),\eta(t,x_1))$ are studieded in both periodic-in-$x_1$ and $x_1\in R$
cases, where $v$ is the velocity and $\eta$ the surface profile. Solutions can
be split into $(v^p,\eta^p)$ and $(v^c,\eta^c)$ whose $k$-th Fourier mode in
$x_1$ correspond to the eigenvalues and the continuous spectra of wave number
$k$, respectively. The component $(v^p,\eta^p)$ is governed by a (possibly
unstable) dispersion relation given by the eigenvalues, which are simply
$k\to-ikc^\pm(k)$ in the case of $x_1\in R$. The other component $(v^c,\eta^c)$
satisfies the inviscid damping as fast as
$|v_1^c|_{L_x^2},|\eta^c|_{L_x^2}=O(|t|^{-1})$ and $|v_2^c|_{L_x^2}=O(t^{-2})$
as $|t|\gg1$. Additional decay of $tv_1^c,t^2v_2^c$ in $L_x^2L_t^q$,
$q\in(2,\infty]$, is obtained after leading asymptotic terms are removed, which
are in the forms of $t$-dependent translations in $x_1$ of certain functions of
$x$.

system: DelightfulTTS for Blizzard Challenge 2021. The goal of this challenge
is to synthesize natural and high-quality speech from text, and we approach
this goal in two perspectives: The first is to directly model and generate
waveform in 48 kHz sampling rate, which brings higher perception quality than
previous systems with 16 kHz or 24 kHz sampling rate; The second is to model
the variation information in speech through a systematic design, which improves
the prosody and naturalness. Specifically, for 48 kHz modeling, we predict 16
kHz mel-spectrogram in acoustic model, and propose a vocoder called HiFiNet to
directly generate 48 kHz waveform from predicted 16 kHz mel-spectrogram, which
can better trade off training efficiency, modelling stability and voice
quality. We model variation information systematically from both explicit
(speaker ID, language ID, pitch and duration) and implicit (utterance-level and
phoneme-level prosody) perspectives: 1) For speaker and language ID, we use
lookup embedding in training and inference; 2) For pitch and duration, we
extract the values from paired text-speech data in training and use two
predictors to predict the values in inference; 3) For utterance-level and
phoneme-level prosody, we use two reference encoders to extract the values in
training, and use two separate predictors to predict the values in inference.
Additionally, we introduce an improved Conformer block to better model the
local and global dependency in acoustic model. For task SH1, DelightfulTTS
achieves 4.17 mean score in MOS test and 4.35 in SMOS test, which indicates the
effectiveness of our proposed system

  arXiv:2104.06595, arXiv:2005.14638",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Face presentation attack detection (fPAD) plays a critical role in the modern
face recognition pipeline. The generalization ability of face presentation
attack detection models to unseen attacks has become a key issue for real-world
deployment, which can be improved when models are trained with face images from
different input distributions and different types of spoof attacks. In reality,
due to legal and privacy issues, training data (both real face images and spoof
images) are not allowed to be directly shared between different data sources.
In this paper, to circumvent this challenge, we propose a Federated Test-Time
Adaptive Face Presentation Attack Detection with Dual-Phase Privacy
Preservation framework, with the aim of enhancing the generalization ability of
fPAD models in both training and testing phase while preserving data privacy.
In the training phase, the proposed framework exploits the federated learning
technique, which simultaneously takes advantage of rich fPAD information
available at different data sources by aggregating model updates from them
without accessing their private data. To further boost the generalization
ability, in the testing phase, we explore test-time adaptation by minimizing
the entropy of fPAD model prediction on the testing data, which alleviates the
domain gap between training and testing data and thus reduces the
generalization error of a fPAD model. We introduce the experimental setting to
evaluate the proposed framework and carry out extensive experiments to provide
various insights about the proposed method for fPAD.

a multi-level partition scheme of the observed data, (2) a cascade of

variance-aware confidence set construction that can take advantage of
low-variance reward. We further prove that the regret of the proposed algorithm

the presence of concrete lower bounding techniques: polynomial method and

bounds using these methods but even to compare and relate them. We explore the
value of these bounds on quantum query complexity for the class of symmetric
functions, arguably one of the most natural and basic set of Boolean functions.
We show that the recently introduced measure of spectral sensitivity give the
same value as both these bounds (positive adversary and approximate degree) for
every total symmetric Boolean function. We also look at the quantum query
complexity of Gap Majority, a partial symmetric function. It has gained
importance recently in regard to understanding the composition of randomized
query complexity. We characterize the quantum query complexity of Gap Majority
and show a lower bound on noisy randomized query complexity (Ben-David and
Blais, FOCS 2020) in terms of quantum query complexity. In addition, we study
how large certificate complexity and block sensitivity can be as compared to
sensitivity (even up to constant factors) for symmetric functions. We show
tight separations, i.e., give upper bound on possible separations and construct
functions achieving the same.

  Space for Robotic Assembly Tasks","Submitted to ICRA 22",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a discrete-continuous action space to learn insertion
primitives for robotic assembly tasks. Primitive is a sequence of elementary
actions with certain exit conditions, such as ""pushing down the peg until
contact"". Since the primitive is an abstraction of robot control commands and
encodes human prior knowledge, it reduces the exploration difficulty and yields
better learning efficiency. In this paper, we learn robot assembly skills via
primitives. Specifically, we formulate insertion primitives as parameterized
actions: hybrid actions consisting of discrete primitive types and continuous
primitive parameters. Compared with the previous work using a set of
discretized parameters for each primitive, the agent in our method can freely
choose primitive parameters from a continuous space, which is more flexible and
efficient. To learn these insertion primitives, we propose Twin-Smoothed
Multi-pass Deep Q-Network (TS-MP-DQN), an advanced version of MP-DQN with twin
Q-network to reduce the Q-value over-estimation. Extensive experiments are
conducted in the simulation and real world for validation. From experiment
results, our approach achieves higher success rates than three baselines:
MP-DQN with parameterized actions, primitives with discrete parameters, and
continuous velocity control. Furthermore, learned primitives are robust to
sim-to-real transfer and can generalize to challenging assembly tasks such as
tight round peg-hole and complex shaped electric connectors with promising
success rates. Experiment videos are available at

discrepancies between odd-order and even-order resonances using classical
mechanical models analogous to the nanocavities. By tuning the resonance

precisely determines primordial curvature fluctuations on larger scales than
$\mathcal O(1)\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, while the small-scale curvature fluctuation is
still less constrained. The constraint on small-scale fluctuations is highly
improved if we assume the standard thermal relic dark matter scenario. When
small-scale fluctuations are large enough, dense regions collapse to form small
halos even in a redshift $z\gtrsim10^3$, which is called ultracompact
minihalos. These minihalos enhance the annihilation of the dark matter and it
is constrained by observations such as extragalactic gamma rays and the CMB. We
revisit the effect of minihalos formed by the small-scale density fluctuations
and calculate the ionization history modified by the dark matter annihilation.
We perform the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the size of
small-scale curvature fluctuations by the CMB power spectrum. It is found that
the constraint from the CMB power spectrum is comparable to that from the
extragalactic gamma rays. We confirm that our constraint mainly comes from the
energy injection in early time ($z\gtrsim 100$) and hence it is independent of
the uncertainty of minihalo properties in the late time.

flavin-superoxide radical pair to explain the modulation of ROS production and
the attenuation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a hypomagnetic field. The
results of our calculations favor a singlet-born radical pair over a
triplet-born radical pair. Our model predicts hypomagnetic field effects on the
triplet/singlet yield of comparable strength as the effects observed in
experimental studies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our predictions are
also in qualitative agreement with experimental results on superoxide

  Using a Bilevel Optimization Strategy",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Strongly motivated from use in various fields including machine learning, the
methodology of sparse optimization has been developed intensively so far.
Especially, the recent advance of algorithms for solving problems with
nonsmooth regularizers is remarkable. However, those algorithms suppose that
weight parameters of regularizers, called hyperparameters hereafter, are
pre-fixed, and it is a crucial matter how the best hyperparameter should be
selected. In this paper, we focus on the hyperparameter selection of
regularizers related to the $\ell_p$ function with $0<p\le 1$ and apply a
bilevel programming strategy, wherein we need to solve a bilevel problem, whose
lower-level problem is nonsmooth, possibly nonconvex and non-Lipschitz.
Recently, for solving a bilevel problem for hyperparameter selection of the
pure $\ell_p\ (0<p \le 1)$ regularizer Okuno et al. discovered new necessary
optimality conditions, called SB(scaled bilevel)-KKT conditions, and further
proposed a smoothing-type algorithm using a certain smoothing function.
However, this optimality measure is loose in the sense that there could be many
points that satisfy the SB-KKT conditions. In this work, we propose new bilevel
KKT conditions, which are new necessary optimality conditions tighter than the
ones proposed by Okuno et al. Moreover, we propose a unified smoothing approach
using smoothing functions that belong to the Chen-Mangasarian class, and then
prove that generated iteration points accumulate at \alert{bilevel KKT points
under milder constraint qualifications. Another contribution is that our
approach and analysis are applicable to a wider class of regularizers.
Numerical comparisons demonstrate which smoothing functions work well for
hyperparameter optimization via bilevel optimization approach.

mean fill. We carry out a large scale experimental analysis using 3,600
AR(1)-based simulated time series to determine the optimal method for
estimating missing values. The results of the numerical experiments show that
the forward and backward fill methods are better suited for times series with
large positive correlations, while the mean fill method is better suited for
times series with low or negative correlations. The extensive and exhaustive
nature of the numerical experiments provides a definitive answer to the
comparison of the three imputation methods.

by taking advantage of the labelled source data and unlabelled target data.
Usually, the source and target domains share the same set of classes. As a
special case, Open-Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) assumes there exist additional
classes in the target domain but not present in the source domain. To solve
such a domain adaptation problem, our proposed method learns discriminative
common subspaces for the source and target domains using a novel Open-Set
Locality Preserving Projection (OSLPP) algorithm. The source and target domain
data are aligned in the learned common spaces class-wisely. To handle the
open-set classification problem, our method progressively selects target
samples to be pseudo-labelled as known classes and rejects the outliers if they
are detected as from unknown classes. The common subspace learning algorithm
OSLPP simultaneously aligns the labelled source data and pseudo-labelled target
data from known classes and pushes the rejected target data away from the known
classes. The common subspace learning and the pseudo-labelled sample
selection/rejection facilitate each other in an iterative learning framework
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets Office-31 and

covariate imbalances and increase the precision of the treatment effect
estimate. We propose a general framework for constructing the confidence
interval (CI) for a difference or ratio effect parameter under stratified
sampling by the method of variance estimates recovery (MOVER). We consider the
additive variance and additive CI approaches for the difference, in which
either the CI for the weighted difference, or the CI for the weighted effect in
each group, or the variance for the weighted difference is calculated as the
weighted sum of the corresponding stratum-specific statistics. The CI for the
ratio is derived by the Fieller and log-ratio methods. The weights can be
random quantities under the assumption of a constant effect across strata, but
this assumption is not needed for fixed weights. These methods can be easily
applied to different endpoints in that they require only the point estimate,
CI, and variance estimate for the measure of interest in each group across
strata. The methods are illustrated with two real examples. In one example, we
derive the MOVER CIs for the risk difference and risk ratio for binary
outcomes. In the other example, we compare the restricted mean survival time
and milestone survival in stratified analysis of time-to-event outcomes.
Simulations show that the proposed MOVER CIs generally outperform the standard
large sample CIs, and that the additive CI approach performs slightly better
than the additive variance approach.

each sentence individually and extract salient sentences one by one to compose
a summary, which have two main drawbacks: (1) neglecting both the intra and
cross-document relations between sentences; (2) neglecting the coherence and
conciseness of the whole summary. In this paper, we propose a novel MDS
framework (SgSum) to formulate the MDS task as a sub-graph selection problem,
in which source documents are regarded as a relation graph of sentences (e.g.,
similarity graph or discourse graph) and the candidate summaries are its
sub-graphs. Instead of selecting salient sentences, SgSum selects a salient
sub-graph from the relation graph as the summary. Comparing with traditional
methods, our method has two main advantages: (1) the relations between
sentences are captured by modeling both the graph structure of the whole
document set and the candidate sub-graphs; (2) directly outputs an integrate
summary in the form of sub-graph which is more informative and coherent.
Extensive experiments on MultiNews and DUC datasets show that our proposed
method brings substantial improvements over several strong baselines. Human
evaluation results also demonstrate that our model can produce significantly
more coherent and informative summaries compared with traditional MDS methods.
Moreover, the proposed architecture has strong transfer ability from single to
multi-document input, which can reduce the resource bottleneck in MDS tasks.

smear and the diverse cell classes, the detection of bone marrow cells is
difficult. The existing bone marrow cell detection algorithms are still
insufficient for the automatic analysis system of bone marrow smears. This
paper proposes a bone marrow cell detection algorithm based on the YOLOv5
network, trained by minimizing a novel loss function. The classification method
of bone marrow cell detection tasks is the basis of the proposed novel loss
function. Since bone marrow cells are classified according to series and
stages, part of the classes in adjacent stages are similar. The proposed novel
loss function considers the similarity between bone marrow cell classes,
increases the penalty for prediction errors between dissimilar classes, and
reduces the penalty for prediction errors between similar classes. The results
show that the proposed loss function effectively improves the algorithm's

carriers. Despite the absence of the CDW phase transition in doped compounds
even for the lowest doping level of $x=0.047$, the superconductivity survives
in all doped samples with enhanced critical temperatures. The high-resolution
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal that the
Ti-dopant in the kagome plane lowers the chemical potential, pushing the van
Hove singularity (VHS) at $M$ point above the Fermi level. First-principle
simulations corroborate the doping evolution of the band structure observed in
ARPES, and affirm that the CDW instability does not occur once the VHS is
pushed above the Fermi level, explaining the absence of the CDW ordering in our
doped samples Cs(V$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$. Our results demonstrate a
competition between the CDW and superconducting orders in the kagome-metal
superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, although the superconductivity is likely
inconsequential of the CDW order.

sources}, a general class of weak sources introduced by Chattopadhyay and Li
(STOC, 2016). An $(n,k,C)$-sumset source $\mathbf{X}$ is a distribution on
$\{0,1\}^n$ of the form $\mathbf{X}_1 + \mathbf{X}_2 + \ldots + \mathbf{X}_C$,
where $\mathbf{X}_i$'s are independent sources on $n$ bits with min-entropy at
least $k$. Prior extractors either required the number of sources $C$ to be a
large constant or the min-entropy $k$ to be at least $0.51 n$.
  As our main result, we construct an explicit extractor for sumset sources in
the setting of $C=2$ for min-entropy $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ and polynomially
small error. We can further improve the min-entropy requirement to $(\log n)
\cdot (\log \log n)^{1 + o(1)}$ at the expense of worse error parameter of our
extractor. We find applications of our sumset extractor for extracting
randomness from other well-studied models of weak sources such as affine
sources, small-space sources, and interleaved sources.
  Interestingly, it is unknown if a random function is an extractor for sumset
sources. We use techniques from additive combinatorics to show that it is a
disperser, and further prove that an affine extractor works for an interesting
subclass of sumset sources which informally corresponds to the ""low doubling""
case (i.e., the support of $\mathbf{X_1} + \mathbf{X_2}$ is not much larger
than $2^k$).

accretion of asteroidal material. Our Sun is to become a WD in several Gyr.
Here, we examine how the solar WD accretes from the three major small body
populations: the main belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian trojan asteroids (JTAs),
and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Owing to the solar mass loss during the
giant branch, 40\% of the JTAs are lost but the vast majority of MBAs and TNOs
survive. During the WD phase, objects from all three populations are
sporadically scattered onto the WD, implying ongoing accretion. For young
cooling ages $\lesssim 100$ Myr, accretion of MBAs predominates; our predicted
accretion rate $\sim10^6$ g/s falls short of observations by two orders of
magnitude. On Gyr timescales, thanks to the consumption of the TNOs that kicks
in $\gtrsim 100$ Myr, the rate oscillates around $10^6-10^7$ g/s until several
Gyr and drops to $\sim10^5$ g/s at 10 Gyr. Our solar WD accretion rate from 1
Gyr and beyond agrees well with those of the extrasolar WDs. We show that for
the solar WD, the accretion source region evolves in an inside-out pattern.
Moreover, in a realistic small body population with individual sizes covering a
wide range as WD pollutants, the accretion is dictated by the largest objects.
As a consequence, the accretion rate is lower by an order of magnitude than
that from a population of bodies of a uniform size and the same total mass and
shows greater scatter.

must account for stochastic disturbances. Such disturbances are often modelled

We present a novel planning method that does not rely on any explicit
representation of the noise distributions. In particular, we address the
problem of computing a controller that provides probabilistic guarantees on
safely reaching a target. First, we abstract the continuous system into a
discrete-state model that captures noise by probabilistic transitions between
states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from the scenario approach to
compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on these transition
probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the noise. We capture
these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a so-called interval
Markov decision process (iMDP). This iMDP is robust against uncertainty in the
transition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be
controlled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification
techniques to provide guarantees on the iMDP, and compute a controller for
which these guarantees carry over to the autonomous system. Realistic
benchmarks show the practical applicability of our method, even when the iMDP
has millions of states or transitions.

edge stability in a wide range of edge safety factors by changing the

this influences the stabilizing effect of the local magnetic shear close to the

calculations with the HELENA code reveal that small ELM plasmas are indeed

enhanced confinement. We also present first non-linear simulations of small ELM

efficiency by casting microstructure reconstruction as a gradient-based

well, so that the interplay of the band structure deformation and MO
conductivities can be studied. We have found that the MO conductivity shows
features in the semi-Dirac system that are quite distinct from the Dirac case
near the ultra-violet and the visible regimes. The real parts of the
longitudinal conductivities, namely Re($\sigma_{xx}$) and Re($\sigma_{yy}$)
(which are different in the semi-Dirac case, as opposed to a Dirac one) present
a series of resonance peaks as a function of the incident photon energy. We
have also found that the absorption peaks corresponding to the $y$-direction
are larger (roughly one order of magnitude) than those corresponding to the
$x$-direction for the semi-Dirac case. In the case of the Hall conductivity,
that is, Re($\sigma_{xy}$), there are extra peaks in the spectra compared to
the Dirac case which originate from the distinct optical transitions of the
carriers from one Landau level to another. We have also explored how the
carrier concentration influences the MO conductivities. In the semi-Dirac case,
there is the emergence of additional peaks yet again in the absorption spectrum
underscoring the presence of an asymmetric dispersion compared to the Dirac
case. Further, we have explored the interplay between the polarization of the
incident beam and the features of the absorption spectra which can be probed in
experiments. Finally, we evaluate the MO activity of the medium by computing
the Faraday rotation angle, $\theta_{F}$.

upward propagation with partial presence of standing waves. We also tested the

similar in period to the Alfv\'en waves observed earlier in the corona of

advantage is the use of a consistent nomenclature in an overarching
machine-learning toolkit instead of a varying package-specific syntax, making
it easier for users to choose from a variety of spatiotemporal resampling

a knowledge graph (KG) by identifying the reasoning relations between topic

reasoning over the multi-hop relational chain preserved in KG to arrive at the
right answer. Despite recent successes, the existing works on answering
multi-hop complex questions still face the following challenges: i) The absence
of an explicit relational chain order reflected in user-question stems from a
misunderstanding of a user's intentions. ii) Incorrectly capturing relational
types on weak supervision of which dataset lacks intermediate reasoning chain
annotations due to expensive labeling cost. iii) Failing to consider implicit
relations between the topic entity and the answer implied in structured KG
because of limited neighborhoods size constraint in subgraph retrieval-based

herein, namely Relational Chain based Embedded KGQA (Rce-KGQA), which
simultaneously utilizes the explicit relational chain revealed in natural

integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), combining both sensing and
communication systems to jointly utilize their resources and to pursue mutual

spectrum co-sharing leads to a fundamental tradeoff between sensing and
communication performance, which is not well understood except for very simple
cases with the same sensing and channel states, and perfect channel state

ISAC model is proposed to account for the scenarios that the sensing state is
different from but correlated with the channel state, and the CSIR is not
necessarily perfect. For the model considered, the optimal tradeoff is
characterized by a capacity-distortion function that quantifies the best
communication rate for a given sensing distortion constraint requirement. An
iterative algorithm is proposed to compute such tradeoff, and a few non-trivial
examples are constructed to demonstrate the benefits of ISAC as compared to the

both problems simultaneously, especially in the non-Cartesian acquisition

understand the role of phonons. Here, we observe that the unusual temperature
dependence of phonons in BaTiO3 gets suppressed when Ba2+ is replaced by Eu2+.
This manifests in a decrease in the cubic-to-tetragonal (i.e.,
para-to-ferroelectric) phase transition temperature (by 150 K) and a complete
suppression of tetragonality of the lattice (at room temperature by 40%
replacement of Ba2+ by Eu2+). We have quantified the anharmonicity of the
phonons and observed that the replacement of Ba2+ by Eu2+ suppresses it (by
93%) with a resultant lowering of the ferroelectric ordering temperature in the
EuxBa1-xTiO3. This suggests that tuning phonon anharmonicity can be an
important route to novel ferroelectric materials.

is trained differently from existing knowledge transfer methods; hence, it has
an advantage in that the prior knowledge acquired from various tasks can be
naturally transferred during the training process to the target task.
Furthermore, it can improve the generalization performance on most datasets
through the proposed knowledge transfer between different problem domains from
multiple source networks. SSKT outperforms the other transfer learning methods

constrained by adaptive-optics astrometry, obtained with the VLT/SPHERE

attributed to this satellite. Hereinafter, we try to link all observations,
spanning 1980--2018. We find the nominal orbit exhibits an unexplained shift by
$+60^\circ$ in the true longitude. Using both periodogram analysis and an $\ell
= 10$ multipole model suitable for the motion of mutually interacting moons
about the irregular body, we confirmed that it is not possible to adjust the
respective osculating period $P_2$. Instead, we were forced to use a model with
tidal dissipation (and increasing orbital periods) to explain the shift. We
also analyzed light curves, spanning 1977--2021, and searched for the expected
spin deceleration of Kleopatra. According to our best-fit model, the observed
period rate is $\dot P_2 = (1.8\pm 0.1)\cdot 10^{-8}\,{\rm d}\,{\rm d}^{-1}$
and the corresponding time lag $\Delta t_2 = 42\,{\rm s}$ of tides, for the
assumed value of the Love number $k_2 = 0.3$. It is the first detection of
tidal evolution for moons orbiting 100-km asteroids. The corresponding
dissipation factor $Q$ is comparable with other terrestrial bodies, albeit at a
higher loading frequency $2|\omega-n|$. We also predict a secular evolution of
the inner moon, $\dot P_1 = 5.0\cdot 10^{-8}$, as well as a spin deceleration
of Kleopatra, $\dot P_0 = 1.9\cdot 10^{-12}$. In alternative models, with moons
captured in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance or more massive moons, the respective
values of $\Delta t_2$ are a factor of 2--3 lower. Future astrometric
observations by direct imaging or occultations should allow to distinguish
between these models, which is important for the internal structure and

which is a measure of the performance index of dynamics systems. First, the
deficiency of chattering in traditional SMC and the quasi-SMC method are
analyzed in this paper. In quasi-SMC, the signum function of the traditional
SMC is replaced with a continuous saturation function. Then, a chattering
reduction algorithm based on integral reinforcement learning (IRL) is proposed.
Under an initial sliding mode controller, the proposed method can learn the
nearly optimal saturation function using policy iteration. To satisfy the
requirement of the learned saturation function, we treat the problem of
training the saturation function as the constraint of an optimization problem.
The online neural network implementation of the proposed algorithm is presented
based on symmetric radius basis functions and a regularized batch least-squares

pressure candidates are found in groups and clusters spanning a wide range in

enhanced star formation rates relative to star-forming field galaxies. The
enhancement in star formation is largely independent of galaxy mass and
strongest for galaxies in clusters. As a result of the large survey footprint

while they achieve state-of-the-art results, most methods are computationally
expensive, requiring significant resources to run in real-time. In the
following, we build on our previous work and develop SRT3D, a sparse
region-based approach to 3D object tracking that bridges this gap in
efficiency. Our method considers image information sparsely along so-called
correspondence lines that model the probability of the object's contour
location. We thereby improve on the current state of the art and introduce
smoothed step functions that consider a defined global and local uncertainty.
For the resulting probabilistic formulation, a thorough analysis is provided.
Finally, we use a pre-rendered sparse viewpoint model to create a joint
posterior probability for the object pose. The function is maximized using
second-order Newton optimization with Tikhonov regularization. During the pose
estimation, we differentiate between global and local optimization, using a
novel approximation for the first-order derivative employed in the Newton
method. In multiple experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting algorithm
improves the current state of the art both in terms of runtime and quality,
performing particularly well for noisy and cluttered images encountered in the

It is thought to be able to accelerate the evolution of their star formation,
trigger the activity of their central active galactic nucleus (AGN) and the
interplay between the galactic and environmental gas, and eventually dissipate
their gas reservoir. We explored the outcomes of ram pressure stripping by
studying the non-thermal radio emission of the jellyfish galaxy JW100 in the
cluster Abell 2626 ($z=0.055$) by combining LOFAR, MeerKAT, and VLA
observations from 0.144 to 5.5 GHz. We studied the integrated spectra of the
stellar disk, the stripped tail and the AGN, mapped the spectral index over the
galaxy, and constrained the magnetic field intensity to be between 11 and 18
$\mu$G in the disk and $<10$ $\mu$G in the tail. The stellar disk radio
emission is dominated by a radiatively old plasma, likely related to an older
phase of high star formation rate. This suggests that the star formation was
quickly quenched by a factor of 4 in a few $10^7$ yr. The radio emission in the
tail is consistent with the stripping scenario, where the radio plasma
originally accelerated in the disk is then displaced in the tail. The
morphology of the radio and X-ray emissions supports the scenario of accretion
of the magnetized environmental plasma onto the galaxy. The AGN non-thermal
spectrum indicates that the relativistic electron acceleration may have
occurred simultaneously with a central ionized gas outflow, thus suggesting a
physical connection between the two processes.

variants from wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity of $10^{-17}$ M
(approximately 6 copies/$\mu$L). The assay took just 10 min with the
Cas12a/crRNA reaction after a simple RT-PCR using a fluorescence reporting

$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K^{2/3})$ regret is guaranteed. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first algorithm with a sublinear regret guarantee for
learning linear mixture SSP. Moreover, we design a refined Bernstein-type
confidence set and propose an improved algorithm, which provably achieves an
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d B_{\star}\sqrt{K/c_{\min}})$ regret. In complement to
the regret upper bounds, we also prove a lower bound of $\Omega(dB_{\star}
\sqrt{K})$. Hence, our improved algorithm matches the lower bound up to a
$1/\sqrt{c_{\min}}$ factor and poly-logarithmic factors, achieving a
near-optimal regret guarantee.

perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric background in full
Horndeski theories. We take a perfect fluid into account as a form of the
Schutz-Sorkin action. Our formulation is sufficiently versatile in that the
second-order actions of perturbations in odd- and even-parity sectors are
derived without choosing particular gauge conditions, so they can be used for
any convenient gauges at hand. The odd-parity sector contains one dynamical
gravitational degree of freedom coupled to a time-independent four velocity of
the fluid. In the even-parity sector there are three dynamical perturbations
associated with gravity, scalar field, and matter sectors, whose equations of
motion are decoupled from other nondynamical perturbations. For high radial and
angular momentum modes, we obtain the propagation speeds of all dynamical
perturbations and show that the perfect fluid in the even-parity sector has a
standard sound speed affected by neither gravity nor the scalar field. Our
general stability conditions and perturbation equations of motion can be
directly applied to the stabilities of neutron stars and black holes as well as
the calculations of their quasi-normal frequencies.

cooling rate more representative of commercial production and provides an
understanding of the potential challenges arising from casting-related
segregation during efforts to scale up medium Mn steels, whilst the smaller
casting has a high cooling rate and different segregation pattern. Sections
from both ingots were homogenised at 1250 \degree C for various times to study
the degree of chemical homogeneity and $\delta$-ferrite dissolution. Within 2
h, the Mn segregation range (max $-$ min) decreased from 8.0 to 1.7 wt\% in the
400 g ingot and from 6.2 to 1.5 wt\% in the 5 kg ingot. Some $\delta$-ferrite
also remained untransformed after 2 h in both ingots but with the 5 kg ingot
showing nearly three times more than the 400 g ingot. Micress modelling was
carried out and good agreement was seen between predicted and measured
segregation levels and distribution. After thermomechanical processing, it was
found that the coarse untransformed $\delta$-ferrite in the 5 kg ingot turned
into coarse $\delta$-ferrite stringers in the finished product, resulting in a
slight decrease in yield strength. Nevertheless, rolled strips from both ingots
showed $>$900 MPa yield strength, $>$1100 MPa tensile strength and $>$40\%
elongation with $<$10\% difference in strength and no change in ductility when

represent stationary distribution functions. The equations incorporate the
geometry of inelastic collisions and a driving mechanism in a transparent way.
Energy is injected by boosting particles that hit the walls of the container to

irreducible toric variety. In the case of a flag variety, its toric
degeneration with desirable properties induces degenerations of Richardson
varieties to unions of irreducible closed toric subvarieties, called semi-toric
degenerations. For instance, Morier-Genoud proved that Caldero's toric
degenerations arising from string polytopes have this property. Semi-toric
degenerations are closely related to Schubert calculus. Indeed, Kogan-Miller
constructed semi-toric degenerations of Schubert varieties from
Knutson-Miller's semi-toric degenerations of matrix Schubert varieties which
give a geometric proof of the pipe dream formula of Schubert polynomials. In
this paper, we focus on a toric degeneration of a flag variety arising from a

small flare events has the advantage of exploring the atmosphere in its

much more common than powerful flares, which allows one to choose from a larger

individual organelles. Each mitochondrion contains on average less than a full

mitochondrial dynamics may allow individual mitochondria to `collect' a full
copy of the mtDNA genome over time, by facilitating exchange between
individuals. Akin to trade on a social network, exchange of mtDNA fragments
across organelles may lead to the emergence of full `effective' genomes in
individuals over time. We characterise the collective dynamics of mitochondria
in \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} hypocotyl cells using a recent approach
combining single-cell timelapse microscopy, video analysis, and network
science. We then use a quantitative model to predict the capacity for the
sharing and accumulation of genetic information through the networks of
encounters between mitochondria. We find that biological encounter networks are
strikingly well predisposed to support the collection of full genomes over
time, outperforming a range of other networks generated from theory and
simulation. Using results from the coupon collector's problem, we show that the
upper tail of the degree distribution is a key determinant of an encounter
network's performance at this task and discuss how features of mitochondrial
dynamics observed in biology facilitate the emergence of full effective
genomes.

A multistage stochastic IP is an IP of the form $\max \{ c^T x \mid \mathcal{A}

$\mathcal{A}$ consists of small block matrices ordered on the diagonal line and
for each stage there are larger blocks with few columns connecting the blocks
in a tree like fashion. Over the last years there was enormous progress in the
area of block structured IPs. For many of the known block IP classes - such as
$n$-fold, tree-fold, and two-stage stochastic IPs, nearly matching upper and
lower bounds are known concerning their computational complexity. One of the
major gaps that remained however was the parameter dependency in the running
time for an algorithm solving multistage stochastic IPs. Previous algorithms
require a tower of $t$ exponentials, where $t$ is the number of stages, while
only a double exponential lower bound was known. In this paper we show that the
tower of $t$ exponentials is actually not necessary. We can show an improved
running time for the algorithm solving multistage stochastic IPs with a running
time of $2^{(d\||A||_\infty)^{\mathcal{O}(d^{3t+1})}} \cdot poly(d,n)$, where
$d$ is the sum of columns in the connecting blocks and $n$ is the number of
blocks on the lowest stage. In contrast to previous works, our algorithm has
only a triple exponential dependency on the parameters and only doubly
exponential for every constant $t$. By this we come very close the known double
exponential bound (based on the exponential time hypothesis) that holds already
for two-stage stochastic IPs, i.e. multistage stochastic IPs with only two
stages.

field using the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. Near the critical
transport current, the dissipation processes are driven by vortex and phase
slip dynamics. The transition between the vortex and phase-slip regimes is
found to depend on the external magnetic field only weakly if the magnetic
field and/or the transport current are switched on gradually. In the case of an
abrupt switch-on of the magnetic field or transport current, the system can be
triggered to the stable phase-slip regime, within a certain window of
parameters. Finally, a hysteresis effect in the current-voltage characteristics
is predicted in superconducting open nanotubes.

any given run of the MDP, the total cost received may be unacceptably high. An
alternative approach is to find a policy which optimises a risk-averse
objective such as conditional value at risk (CVaR). However, optimising the
CVaR alone may result in poor performance in expectation. In this work, we
begin by showing that there can be multiple policies which obtain the optimal
CVaR. This motivates us to propose a lexicographic approach which minimises the
expected cost subject to the constraint that the CVaR of the total cost is
optimal. We present an algorithm for this problem and evaluate our approach on
four domains. Our results demonstrate that our lexicographic approach improves
the expected cost compared to the state of the art algorithm, while achieving

has a highly variable structure. How this complex behaviour is formed in the
solar corona is not yet known, since it requires omnipresent fluctuations,
which constantly emit material to feed the wind. In this article we analysed 14
upflow regions in the solar corona to find potential sources for plasma flow.
The upflow regions were derived from spectroscopic data from the EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode determining their Doppler velocity and
defining regions which have blueshifts stronger than $-6\,km\,s^{-1}$. To
identify the sources of this blueshift data from the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), onboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the X-ray Telescope (XRT), onboard
Hinode, were used. The analysis revealed that only 5 out of 14 of the upflows
were associated with frequent transients, like obvious jets or bright points.
In contrast to that, seven events were associated with small-scale features,
which show a large variety of dynamics. Some resemble small bright points,
while others show an eruptive nature, all of which are faint and only live for
a few minutes; we can not rule out that several of these sources may be fainter
and, hence, less obvious jets. Since the complex structure of the solar wind is
known, this suggests that new sources have to be considered or better methods
used to analyse the known sources. This work shows that small and frequent
features, which were previously neglected, can cause strong upflows in the
solar corona. These results emphasise the importance of the first observations
from the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard Solar Orbiter, which revealed
complex small-scale coronal structures.

elongated, disk-like structure near 3.5$\mu$m, similar to what has been
observed in other wavelength regimes. In particular, the orientation at a

denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is gaining popularity in emerging
cyber-physical applications. In previous works, explicit system models are
required to design a predictor-based resilient controller. These models can be
either given a priori or obtained through a prior system identification step.
Recent research efforts have focused on data-driven control based on
pre-collected input-output trajectories (i.e., without explicit system models).
In this paper, we take an initial step toward data-driven stabilization of
stochastic LTI systems under DoS attacks, and develop a resilient model
predictive control (MPC) scheme driven purely by data-dependent conditions. The
proposed data-driven control method achieves the same level of resilience as
the model-based control method. For example, local input-to-state stability
(ISS) is achieved under mild assumptions on the noise and the DoS attacks. To
recover global ISS, two modifications are further suggested at the price of
reduced resilience against DoS attacks or increased computational complexity.
Finally, a numerical example is given to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed control method.

exists a gap in accuracy between real-time models and slower state-of-the-art

iterative multi-scale coarse-to-fine refinement (iCFR) framework to bridge this
gap by allowing it to adopt any stereo matching network to make it fast, more
efficient and scalable while keeping comparable accuracy. To reduce the
computational cost of matching, we use multi-scale warped features to estimate
disparity residuals and push the disparity search range in the cost volume to a
minimum limit. Finally, we apply a refinement network to recover the loss of
precision which is inherent in multi-scale approaches. We test our iCFR
framework by adopting the matching networks from state-of-the art GANet and
AANet. The result is 49$\times$ faster inference time compared to GANetdeep and
4$\times$ less memory consumption, with comparable error. Our best performing
network, which we call FRSNet is scalable even up to an input resolution of 6K

randomness for key generation and has proven to be an effective addition
security layer in wireless communications. However, static or scarcely random
channels require artificially induced dynamics to improve the secrecy
performance, e.g., using intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). One key
challenge is that the induced random phase from IRS is also reflected in the
direction to eavesdroppers (Eve). This leakage enables Eve nodes to estimate
the legitimate channels and secret key via a globally known pilot sequence. To
mitigate the secret key leakage issue, we propose to exploit random matrix
theory to inform the design of a new physical layer secret key generation
(PL-SKG) algorithm. We prove that, when sending appropriate random Gaussian
matrices, the singular values of Alice's and Bob's received signals follow a
similar probability distribution. Leveraging these common singular values, we
propose a random Gaussian matrix based PL-SKG (RGM PL-SKG), which avoids the
usages of the globally known pilot and thereby prevents the aforementioned
leakage issue. Our results show the following: (i) high noise resistance which
leads to superior secret key rate (SKR) improvement (up to 300%) in low SNR
regime, and (ii) general improved SKR performance against multiple colluded
Eves. We believe our combination of random matrix theory and PL-SKG shows a new
paradigm to secure the wireless communication channels.

data can be sparsely represented. Methods in the literature typically formulate
the dictionary learning problem as an optimization w.r.t. two variables, i.e.,
dictionary and sparse coefficients, and solve it by alternating between two
stages: sparse coding and dictionary update. The key contribution of this work
is a Rank-One Atomic Decomposition (ROAD) formulation where dictionary learning
is cast as an optimization w.r.t. a single variable which is a set of rank one
matrices. The resulting algorithm is hence single-stage. Compared with
two-stage algorithms, ROAD minimizes the sparsity of the coefficients whilst
keeping the data consistency constraint throughout the whole learning process.
An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is derived to solve the
optimization problem and the lower bound of the penalty parameter is computed
to guarantees a global convergence despite non-convexity of the optimization
formulation. From practical point of view, ROAD reduces the number of tuning
parameters required in other benchmark algorithms. Numerical tests demonstrate

(PFCs) for the problem of output synchronization over heterogeneous agents and
the benefits this approach can provide. Specifically, it addresses the addition
of stable PFCs on agents that interact with each other using diffusive
couplings. The value in the application of such PFC is twofold. Firstly, it has
been an issue that output synchronization among passivity-short systems
requires global information for the design of controllers in the cases when
initial conditions need to be taken into account, such as average consensus and
distributed optimization. We show that a stable PFC can be designed to
passivate a passivity-short system while its output asymptotically vanishes as
its input tends to zero. As a result, output synchronization is achieved among
these systems by fully distributed controls without altering the original
consensus results. Secondly, in the literature of output synchronization over
signed weighted graphs, it is generally required that the graph Laplacian be
positive semidefinite, i.e., $L \geq 0$ for undirected graphs or $L + L^T \geq
0$ for balanced directed graphs. We show that the PFC serves as output feedback
to the communication graph to enhance the robustness against negative weight
edges. As a result, output synchronization is achieved over a signed weighted
and balanced graph, even if the corresponding Laplacian is not positive
semidefinite.

mapping of fermionic states to qubits. The key characteristic of an efficient
mapping is its ability to translate local fermionic interactions into local
qubit interactions, leading to easy-to-simulate qubit Hamiltonians.
  All fermion-qubit mappings must use a numbering scheme for the fermionic
modes in order for translation to qubit operations. We make a distinction
between the unordered, symbolic labelling of fermions and the ordered, numeric
labelling of the qubits to which the fermionic system maps. This separation
shines light on a new way to design fermion-qubit mappings by making use of the
extra degree of freedom -- the enumeration scheme for the fermionic modes. This
allows well-defined concepts of optimal fermion-qubit mappings: for example,
the main focus of this paper is in identifying Jordan-Wigner transformations
that minimise the average number of Pauli matrices in the terms of the qubit
Hamiltonians they produce. Given a fermionic system, it does not expend any
resources to choose the optimal fermionic enumeration schemes for practical
cost functions of the target qubit Hamiltonian.
  We demonstrate how Mitchison and Durbin's enumeration pattern is optimal for
minimising the average Pauli weight of Jordan-Wigner transformations of the
systems interacting in square fermionic lattices. This leads to qubit
Hamiltonians consisting of terms with average Pauli weights 13.9% shorter than
previously known. Furthermore, by adding only two ancilla qubits we introduce a
new class of fermion-qubit mappings, and reduce the average Pauli weight of
Hamiltonian terms by 37.9% compared to previous methods. For other natural
$n$-mode fermionic systems we find enumeration patterns which result in
$n^{1/4}$ improvement in average Pauli weight over na\""ive enumeration schemes.

quantum boosting algorithm with similar theoretical guarantees. Their
algorithm, which we refer to as QAdaBoost henceforth, is a quantum adaptation
of AdaBoost and only works for the binary hypothesis case. QAdaBoost is
quadratically faster than AdaBoost in terms of the VC-dimension of the
hypothesis class of the weak learner but polynomially worse in the bias of the
weak learner.
  Izdebski et al. posed an open question on whether we can boost quantum weak
learners that output non-binary hypothesis. In this work, we address this open
question by developing the QRealBoost algorithm which was motivated by the
classical RealBoost algorithm. The main technical challenge was to provide
provable guarantees for convergence, generalization bounds, and quantum
speedup, given that quantum subroutines are noisy and probabilistic. We prove
that QRealBoost retains the quadratic speedup of QAdaBoost over AdaBoost and
further achieves a polynomial speedup over QAdaBoost in terms of both the bias
of the learner and the time taken by the learner to learn the target concept
class.
  Finally, we perform empirical evaluations on QRealBoost and report
encouraging observations on quantum simulators by benchmarking the convergence
performance of QRealBoost against QAdaBoost, AdaBoost, and RealBoost on a

existing optimization-based quantification entails high computational burdens
limiting flexibility utilization in real-time applications, and a more

functions are proposed to approximate the flexibility envelopes with
significantly fewer parameters, which can be communicated to system operators
instead of the original flexibility envelope. The results show that the most
promising prediction and approximation approaches allow for a minimum reduction
of the computational burden by a factor of 9 and of the communication load by a
factor of 6.6, respectively.

spin-orbit (SO) coupling at the fifth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (5.5PN) order.
The method we use splits the conservative dynamics into local and
nonlocal-in-time parts, then relates the local-in-time part to gravitational
self-force results by exploiting the simple mass-ratio dependence of the
post-Minkowskian expansion of the scattering angle. We calculate the nonlocal

5.5PN SO coefficients from first-order self-force results for the redshift and
spin-precession invariants, except for one unknown that could be fixed in the
future by second-order self-force results. However, by incorporating our 5.5PN
results in the effective-one-body formalism and comparing its binding energy to
numerical relativity, we find that the remaining unknown has a small effect on
the SO dynamics, demonstrating an improvement in accuracy at that order.

increased and the catalyst showed only slight diffusion enhancement within the
range expected for reaction-induced sample heating. The decrease in diffusion
coefficient of the alkyne, one of the two reactants of click reaction, was not

previous representations have flaws in one or more aspects. Thin-Plate-Spline

Inspired by this, we reversely think of its usage and sophisticatedly take TPS

near-horizontal one to assist the subsequent recognition. To further exploit
the potential of the TPS representation, the Border Alignment Loss is proposed.
Based on these designs, we implement the text detector TPSNet, which can be

widely in the world, causing a huge threat to people's living environment.
Objective: Under computed tomography (CT) imaging, the structure features of
COVID-19 lesions are complicated and varied greatly in different cases. To
accurately locate COVID-19 lesions and assist doctors to make the best
diagnosis and treatment plan, a deep-supervised ensemble learning network is
presented for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT images. Methods: Considering
the fact that a large number of COVID-19 CT images and the corresponding lesion
annotations are difficult to obtained, a transfer learning strategy is employed
to make up for the shortcoming and alleviate the overfitting problem. Based on
the reality that traditional single deep learning framework is difficult to
extract COVID-19 lesion features effectively, which may cause some lesions to
be undetected. To overcome the problem, a deep-supervised ensemble learning
network is presented to combine with local and global features for COVID-19
lesion segmentation. Results: The performance of the proposed method was
validated in experiments with a publicly available dataset. Compared with
manual annotations, the proposed method acquired a high intersection over union
(IoU) of 0.7279. Conclusion: A deep-supervised ensemble learning network was
presented for coronavirus pneumonia lesion segmentation in CT images. The
effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by visual inspection and
quantitative evaluation. Experimental results shown that the proposed mehtod
has a perfect performance in COVID-19 lesion segmentation.

The efficiency increase it offers in comparison with coherent light is modest,

several models of maps on non-oriented surfaces can be used to obtain explicit

genus and size parameters. Using techniques already known in the orientable
case (elimination of variables via Virasoro constraints or Tutte equations), we
naturally obtain recurrence formulas with non-polynomial coefficients. This
non-polynomiality reflects the presence of shifts of the charge parameter in
the BKP equation. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to obtain
non-shifted versions, meaning pure ODEs for the associated generating
functions, from which recurrence relations with polynomial coefficients can be
extracted. We treat the cases of triangulations, general maps, and bipartite
maps. These recurrences with polynomial coefficients are conceptually
interesting but bigger to write than those with non-polynomial coefficients.
However they are relatively nice-looking in the case of one-face maps. In
particular we show that Ledoux's recurrence for non-oriented one-face maps can
be recovered in this way, and we obtain the analogous statement for the

recruiting a new provider only when the success probability of the already

ballooning/drift wave dynamics: unstable modes experience explosive growth at
high pressure gradients after a phase in which they are stabilized by the
diamagnetic coupling leading to the onset of a transport barrier. The sheared
$E\times B$ flow does not play any significant role. After relaxation the
transport barrier forms again and it sets the conditions for a novel
relaxation, resulting in an oscillatory behavior. We find that energy flux into
the scrape of layer decreases with increasing oscillation frequency and that
the oscillations are tamed by increasing plasma temperature. This behavior is
reminiscent of so-called type III Edge Localized Modes. A one-dimensional model
reproducing the relaxations is also derived.

and ultrafast spin dynamics. One of the urgent challenges, hindering the

gap between AFM metals and insulators. Here, we demonstrate the insulator-metal
transition and persistently large anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in single
crystals Sr2(Ir1-xGax)O4 (0<x<0.09) which host the same basal-plane AFM lattice
with strong spin-orbit coupling. The non-doped Sr2IrO4 shows the insulating
transport with the AMR as big as ~16.8% at 50 K. The Ga substitution of Ir
allows a gradual reduction of electrical resistivity, and a clear
insulator-to-metal transition is identified in doped samples with x above 0.05,
while the AMR can still have ~1%, sizable in comparison with those in AFM
metals reported so far. Our experiments reveal that all the samples have the
similar fourfold AMR symmetry, which can be well understood in the scenario of

mixing has often been employed. However, it has been still unclear how to
choose important Slater determinants from a huge model space. We propose a
novel efficient method as the Replica Exchange Monte-Carlo (RXMC) method to
sample important Slater determinants and optimize and analyze the obtained
results. As an application, we apply it to the ground and excited states of
$^{12}$C based on the Bloch-Brink $\alpha$ cluster model and show the detailed
structure of the obtained states. The RXMC method enables us to efficiently
sample Slater determinants following the Boltzmann distribution on the
multi-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) under a given model space. To
analyze the obtained excited states, we embed sampled basis functions onto the
PES calculated with the $\beta$-$\gamma$ constraint method and discuss the main
component in the state. The RXMC method can efficiently perform the samplings
with a temperature parameter of $T_L=2.5$ MeV in $^{12}$C. We obtain the
gas-like state with a wide density distribution in the tail part in the second
$0^+$ state. We also obtain the linear-chain-like states with the bending and
stretching vibrational modes in the third and fourth $0^+$ states,
respectively. In the fifth $0^+$ state, the main component of the basis
functions contains expanded equilateral triangle configurations. The second
$0^+$ gas-like state emerges at the local minimum in the PES, which is the
beginning of the valley structure connected to the linear-chain breakup
channel. The third and fourth linear-chain-like states emerge in this valley
structure. We conclude that the RXMC method is a powerful method to calculate
the excited states of nuclei, which would be applied to much complicated
nuclear fission dynamics in heavier nuclei.

the fast reaction to changes in data distributions. We propose a new Chunk

QDs after incorporation into the MAPbBr$_3$ matrix. Ensemble photoluminescence
excitation (PLE) spectra exhibit signatures of wavelength-dependent coupling
between the CdSe/CdZnS QDs and the MAPbBr$_3$ matrix. Spatially-resolved PL
experiments reveal a strong correlation between the positions of QDs and an
enhancement of the PL signal of the matrix. Fluorescence lifetime imaging
(FLIM)of the doped films furthermore show that the emission lifetime of
MAPbBr$_3$ is slower in the vicinity of QDs, which, in combination with the
increased PL signal of the matrix, suggests that QDs can act as nucleation
seeds that improve the crystallinity of MAPbBr$_3$, boosting its emission
quantum yield. Antibunching measurements provide clear evidence of
single-photon emission from individual QDs-in-perovskite. Finally, the analysis
of blinking statistics indicates an improvement of the photostability of
individual QDs in perovskite as compared to bare CdSe/CdZnS QDs. At high doping
levels, this work opens the route to hybrid-based LEDs. Low-doping content

ultrasound devices and automatic ultrasound acquisition techniques, an
automated interpretation method requiring only a limited set of views as input
could make preliminary cardiovascular disease diagnoses more accessible. In
this study, we developed a deep learning (DL) method for automated detection of
impaired left ventricular (LV) function and aortic valve (AV) regurgitation
from apical four-chamber (A4C) ultrasound cineloops and investigated which
anatomical structures or temporal frames provided the most relevant information
for the DL model to enable disease classification.
  Methods and Results. A4C ultrasounds were extracted from 3,554
echocardiograms of patients with either impaired LV function (n=928), AV
regurgitation (n=738), or no significant abnormalities (n=1,888). Two
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained separately to classify the
respective disease cases against normal cases. The overall classification
accuracy of the impaired LV function detection model was 86%, and that of the
AV regurgitation detection model was 83%. Feature importance analyses
demonstrated that the LV myocardium and mitral valve were important for
detecting impaired LV function, while the tip of the mitral valve anterior
leaflet, during opening, was considered important for detecting AV
regurgitation.
  Conclusion. The proposed method demonstrated the feasibility of a 3D CNN
approach in detection of impaired LV function and AV regurgitation using A4C
ultrasound cineloops. The current research shows that DL methods can exploit
large training data to detect diseases in a different way than conventionally

slowly varying property. Namely, we assume that arms' rewards are stochastic
and independent over time, but that the absolute difference between the
expected rewards of any arm at any two consecutive time-steps is at most a
drift limit $\delta > 0$. For this setting that has not received enough
attention in the past, we give a new algorithm which extends naturally the
well-known Successive Elimination algorithm to the non-stationary bandit
setting. We establish the first instance-dependent regret upper bound for
slowly varying non-stationary bandits. The analysis in turn relies on a novel
characterization of the instance as a detectable gap profile that depends on
the expected arm reward differences. We also provide the first minimax regret
lower bound for this problem, enabling us to show that our algorithm is
essentially minimax optimal. Also, this lower bound we obtain matches that of
the more general total variation-budgeted bandits problem, establishing that
the seemingly easier former problem is at least as hard as the more general
latter problem in the minimax sense. We complement our theoretical results with
experimental illustrations.

written under the supervision of Professor Krzysztof Stempak in 2019. For
general (possibly nondoubling) metric measure spaces various properties of the
associated maximal operators, centered $\mathcal{M}^{\rm c}$ and noncentered
$\mathcal{M}$, are investigated. Chapter 1 is the introduction to the topic. In
Chapter 2 the classification of possible interrelations between the occurrences
of strong, weak, and restricted weak type inequalities for both
$\mathcal{M}^{\rm c}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ simultaneously is given. In Chapter 3 a
similar analysis for the so-called modified maximal operators is performed.
Chapter 4 is devoted to studying the boundedness of $\mathcal{M}^{\rm c}$ from
$L^{p,q}$ to $L^{p,r}$. In particular, for each fixed $p \in (1, \infty)$ the
classification of possible shapes of the sets \[ \Big\{ \Big(
\frac{1}{q},\frac{1}{r} \Big) \in [0,1] \times [0,1] : \mathcal{M}^{\rm c}
\text{ is bounded from } L^{p,q} \text{ to } L^{p,r} \Big\} \] is given for the
class of spaces satisfying a mild support assumption $\mu(X \setminus {\rm
supp}(\mu)) = 0$. The main result of Chapter 5 is the classification of
possible interrelations between the spaces ${\rm BMO}^p$, $p \in [1,\infty)$.
In Chapter 6 a dichotomy regarding the finiteness of maximal functions
associated with doubling spaces is tested in general setting. As a result, each
of the four configurations regarding its occurrence or not for
$\mathcal{M}^{\rm c}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ is illustrated with a suitably chosen
nondoubling space. Finally, Appendix contains a new elementary proof of the
interpolation theorem for Lorentz spaces with the first parameter fixed and the
second parameter varying among its natural range of admissibility.

additive manufacturing (AM) is difficult due to the presence of multiple scales
in both time and space, ranging from the part scale (order of
millimeters/seconds) to the powder scale (order of microns/milliseconds). This
difficulty is compounded by the fact that the regions of small-scale behavior
are not fixed, but change in time as the geometry is produced. While much work
in recent years has been focused on resolving the problem of multiple scales in
space, there has been less work done on multiscale approaches for the temporal
discretization of LPBF problems. In the present contribution, we extend on a
previously introduced two-level method in space by combining it with a
multiscale time integration method. The unique transfer of information through
the transmission conditions allows for interaction between the space and time
scales while reducing computational costs. At the same time, all of the
advantages of the two-level method in space (namely its geometrical flexibility
and the ease in which one may deploy structured, uniform meshes) remain intact.
Adopting the proposed multiscale time integration scheme, we observe a
computational speed-up by a factor $\times 2.44$ compared to the same two-level
approach with uniform time integration, when simulating a laser source
traveling on a bare plate of nickel-based superalloy material following an
alternating scan path of fifty laser tracks.

can be modified in radial domains in general dimensions. Previously, upper and
lower estimates of GBU or RBC rates were available only in special case when
basic comparison principle can be used. Even for type II BU in other PDEs, as
far as we know, there has been no complete classification except [50], in which
the argument relies on features peculiar to chemotaxis syst. Whereas there are
many results on construction of special type II BU sol. of PDEs with
investigation of (in-)stability of bubble, determination of (in-)stability of
space-time profile for general sol. has not been done. In this paper, we
determine whether space-time profile for each sol. is stable or unstable.
  A key in our proofs is to focus on algebraic structure with respect to
vanishing intersections with singular steady state. In turn, GBU and RBC rates
and profiles, as well as their (in-)stability, can be completely characterized
by the number of vanishing intersections. We construct special sol. in bounded
and unbounded intervals in both GBU and RBC cases, based on methods from [29],
and then apply braid group theory to get upper and lower estimates of the
rates. After that, we rule out oscillation of the rates, which leads us to the
complete space-time profile. In the process, careful construction of special
sol. with specific behaviors in intermediate and outer regions, far from bubble
and the RBC point, plays essential role. The application of such techniques to
viscosity sol. is completely new.

Estimations of their typical frequencies make them perfect targets for the
current network of advanced, ground-based detectors. A successful detection
could potentially reveal the underlying explosion mechanism through the
analysis of the waveform. This has been illustrated using the SupernovaModel
Evidence Extractor (SMEE; Logue et al. (2012)), an algorithm based on
principal-component analysis and Bayesian model selection. Here, we present a
complementary approach to SMEE based on (supervised) dictionary-learning and
show that it is able to reconstruct and classify CCSN signals according to
their morphology. Our waveform signals are obtained from (a) two publicly
available catalogs built from numerical simulations of neutrino-driven (Mur)
and magneto-rotational (Dim) CCSN explosions and (b) from a third 'mock'
catalog of simulated sine-Gaussian (SG) waveforms. Those signals are injected
into coloured Gaussian noise to simulate the background noise of Advanced LIGO
in its broadband configuration and scaled to a freely-specifiable
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We show that our approach correctly classifies
signals from all three dictionaries. In particular, for SNR=15-20, we obtain
perfect matches for both Dim and SG signals and about 85% true classifications
for Mur signals. These results are comparable to those reported by SMEE for the
same CCSN signals when those are injected in only one LIGO detector. We discuss
the main limitations of our approach as well as possible improvements.

Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft conducted a
series of Almost Limb activities to look for dust near the dawn terminator
region. During these activities the instrument stared at a fixed point in the
zodiacal background off the Moon's limb while the spacecraft moved in
retrograde orbit from the sunlit to the unlit side of the Moon. The spectra
obtained from these activities probe altitudes within a few kilometers of the
Moon's surface, a region whose dust populations were not well constrained by
previous remote-sensing observations from orbiting spacecraft. Filtering these
spectra to remove a varying instrumental signal enables constraints to be
placed on potential signals from a dust atmosphere. These filtered spectra are
compared with those predicted for dust atmospheres with various exponential
scale heights and particle size distributions to yield upper limits on the dust
number density for these potential populations. For a differential size
distribution proportional to $s^{-3}$ (where $s$ is the particle size) and a
scale height of 1 km, we obtain an upper limit on the number density of dust
particles at the Moon's surface of 142 $m^{-3}$.

compressibility of brittle tubular particle assemblies. The material is
extremely porous due to the presence of a large hole within the tube-shaped
particle. The release of the inner void, protected by a fragile shell, gives
the material a very strong ability to compress. The compressive response is
investigated by means of the Discrete Element Method, DEM, using
crushable-elements. To address the complexity of the model, a step-by-step
break-down is developed. The paper comprises the comparison of the numerical
results with both results obtained by the authors and existing experiments.
With the insights provided by the DEM, we have sought to better understand the
phenomena that originate at the grain scale, and that govern macroscopic
behaviour. Grain breakage was proven to control the compressive behaviour, and
thus, the importance of internal pores dominates the inter-particle voids.
Then, a novel concept of compressibility analysis has been proposed using the
separation of the double porosity and the quantification of the pore collapse
through primary grain breakage. Finally, a general, geometrical development of
a semi-analytical model has been proposed aiming the prediction of the
evolution of double porosity vs axial strain.

system, in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) aims to send confidential

sense several targets that may be suspicious eavesdroppers. To ensure the
sensing quality while preventing the eavesdropping, we consider that the BS
sends dedicated sensing signals (in addition to confidential information
signals) that play a dual role of artificial noise (AN) for confusing the
eavesdropping targets. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the transmit
information and sensing beamforming at the BS, to minimize the matching error
between the transmit beampattern and a desired beampattern for sensing, subject
to the minimum secrecy rate requirement at the CU and the transmit power
constraint at the BS. Although the formulated problem is non-convex, we propose
an algorithm to obtain the globally optimal solution by using the semidefinite
relaxation (SDR) together with a one-dimensional (1D) search. Next, to avoid
the high complexity induced by the 1D search, we also present two sub-optimal
solutions based on zero-forcing and separate beamforming designs, respectively.
Numerical results show that the proposed designs properly adjust the
information and sensing beams to balance the tradeoffs among communicating with
CU, sensing targets, and confusing eavesdroppers, thus achieving desirable
transmit beampattern for sensing while ensuring the CU's secrecy rate.

solutions to improve the robustness of DNN models. Due to the extensiveness and
high liquidity of natural language over the social networks, various natural
language based adversarial attack algorithms have been proposed in the
literature. These algorithms generate adversarial text examples with high
semantic quality. However, the generated adversarial text examples may be
maliciously or illegally used. In order to tackle with this problem, we present
a general framework for generating watermarked adversarial text examples. For
each word in a given text, a set of candidate words are determined to ensure
that all the words in the set can be used to either carry secret bits or
facilitate the construction of adversarial example. By applying a word-level
adversarial text generation algorithm, the watermarked adversarial text example
can be finally generated. Experiments show that the adversarial text examples
generated by the proposed method not only successfully fool advanced DNN
models, but also carry a watermark that can effectively verify the ownership
and trace the source of the adversarial examples. Moreover, the watermark can
still survive after attacked with adversarial example generation algorithms,
which has shown the applicability and superiority.

By combining these maps, threads can access compact space and interact with

decays at $- \infty$ but approaches a nonzero limit at $+\infty$. TOFs usually
appear in complex Ginzburg Landau equations of the type $U_t = \alpha U_{xx} +

from linearizing about the TOF in a co-moving and co-rotating frame, has

further isolated eigenvalues are bounded away from the imaginary axis. The
basic idea of the proof is to consider the problem in an extended phase space

since full Pareto sets become impractically large for more than two criteria,
we adapt an approach by Delling et al. to restrict the Pareto set in a

varying blend absorption levels, which may indicate different depths of the

with current world-leading measurements, and to make a substantial contribution
to an LHC-wide average due to the complementary acceptance of LHCb with respect

induce strong optical nonlinearities and correlations between individual light

exotic bound states of photons, which form quantum mechanical precursors of
optical solitons, as found in many optical media. Here, we study the
propagation of light through an optical waveguide that is chirally coupled to
three-level quantum emitters. We show that the additional laser-coupling to a
third emitter state not only permits to control the properties of the bound
state but can even eliminate it entirely. This makes it possible to turn an
otherwise focussing nonlinearity into a repulsive photon-photon interaction. We
demonstrate this emerging photon-photon repulsion by analysing the quantum
dynamics of multiple photons in large emitter arrays and reveal a dynamical
fragmentation of incident uncorrelated light fields and self-ordering into
regular trains of single photons. These striking effects expand the rich
physics of waveguide quantum electrodynamics into the domain of repulsive
photons and establish a conceptually simple platform to explore optical
self-organization phenomena at the quantum level. We discuss implementations of
this setting in cold-atom experiments and propose a new approach based on

However, the study of the fundamental event data association problem is still
in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a novel Event Data Association
approach (called EDA) to explicitly address the data association problem. The
proposed EDA seeks for event trajectories that best fit the event data, in
order to perform unifying data association. In EDA, we first asynchronously
gather the event data, based on its information entropy. Then, we introduce a
deterministic model hypothesis generation strategy, which effectively generates
model hypotheses from the gathered events, to represent the corresponding event
trajectories. After that, we present a two-stage weighting algorithm, which
robustly weighs and selects true models from the generated model hypotheses,
through multi-structural geometric model fitting. Meanwhile, we also propose an
adaptive model selection strategy to automatically determine the number of the
true models. Finally, we use the selected true models to associate the event
data, without being affected by sensor noise and irrelevant structures. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed EDA on the object tracking task. The
experimental results show the effectiveness of EDA under challenging scenarios,
such as high speed, motion blur, and high dynamic range conditions.

including Seurat, SC3, K-Means, and Hierarchical Clustering. Simulation results
show that RZiMM-scRNA demonstrates superior clustering performance and enhanced
biomarker detection accuracy compared to alternative methods, especially when
cell subgroups are less distinct, verifying the robustness of our method. Our
empirical investigations focus on two brain tumor studies dealing with
astrocytoma of various grades, including the most malignant of all brain

definition of the mass splittings between neutrino mass eigenstates, done in
the latest analysis of experimental data, can be of crucial importance for
defining the nature of neutrino mass hierarchy. The Standard Model has three
generations of fundamental matter particles. Three generations of the charged
lepton mass show a hierarchical structure. Owing to that, there is a belief and
it is considered that neutrinos may follow such a hierarchical structure. In
our calculations, we have also included the latest data obtained, based on the
processing of measurement results, which showed that even with such data,
obtained results favor the normal neutrino mass hierarchy. As for the
individual neutrino mass calculated in this paper, in today's neutrino physics
it is only known that the neutrino mass scale is bounded only from above, and
both the Dirac and the Majorana character of neutrinos are compatible with all
observations. Among some of the questions resolved in this paper, which are
related to the properties of neutrinos, a positive answer was also given to the

simulation methods. Finally, the neural ODE and DAE modules are implemented
with Python and made public on GitHub. Using the portal measurements, three
simple but representative cases of excitation controller modeling, photovoltaic
power plant modeling, and equivalent load modeling of a regional power network

simultaneous application of two one-qubit and two two-qubit gates are included
in the quantum gate simulations. In particular, by studying the parallel

  systems from partial observations",,,,,"eess.SP math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a popular data-driven
modeling approach to identifying spatio-temporal coherent structures in
dynamical systems, owing to its strong relation with the Koopman operator. For
dynamical systems with external forcing, the identified model should not only
be suitable for a specific forcing function but should generally approximate
the input-output behavior of the underlying dynamics. A novel methodology for
modeling those classes of dynamical systems is proposed in the present work,
using wavelets in conjunction with the input-output dynamic mode decomposition
(ioDMD). Our non-intrusive approach constructs numerical models directly from
trajectories of the full model's inputs and outputs, without requiring the
full-model operators. These trajectories are generated by running a simulation
of the full model or observing the original dynamical systems' response to
inputs in an experimental framework. Hence, the present methodology is
applicable for dynamical systems whose internal state vector measurements are
not available. Instead, data from only a few output locations are only
accessible, as often the case in practice. The present methodology's
applicability is explained by modeling the input-output response of a finite
element beam model. The WDMD provides a linear state-space representation of
the dynamical system using the response measurements and the corresponding
input forcing functions. The developed state-space model is then used to
simulate the beam's response towards different types of forcing functions. The
method is further validated on an experimental data set using modal analysis on
a simple free-free beam, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed methodology
as an appropriate candidate for modeling practical dynamical systems despite
having no access to internal state measurements and treating the full model as
a black-box.

stabilising the predictions and in reducing the theoretical uncertainty for
both inclusive and exclusive jet production for all three modes. This is
particularly true in the kinematical regimes associated with low to medium

Nickel layer is magnetized, we observe circularly polarized photoluminescence
of the trion peak in MoSe2 monolayer under linearly polarized excitation. This
build-up of circular polarization can reach a measured value of about 4% when
the magnetization of Ni is saturated perpendicularly to the sample plane, and
changes its sign when the magnetization is reversed. The circular polarization

which is the combination of the log-signature layer and recurrent type neural
networks (RNNs). The former one comes from the mathematically principled
technology of signatures and log-signatures as representations for streamed
data, which can manage high sample rate streams, non-uniform sampling and time
series of variable length. It serves as an enhancement of the recurrent layer,
which can be conveniently plugged into neural networks. Besides we propose two
path transformation layers to significantly reduce path dimension while
retaining the essential information fed into the Logsig-RNN module. Finally,
numerical results demonstrate that replacing the RNN module by the Logsig-RNN
module in SOTA networks consistently improves the performance on both Chalearn
gesture data and NTU RGB+D 120 action data in terms of accuracy and robustness.
In particular, we achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on Chalearn2013 gesture

galaxies at $z\sim1.5-2$, compared with RS and BC galaxies. We also compare AGN
accretion timescales with typical color transition timescales of $UV$-selected
galaxies. We find that the lifetime of GV galaxies at $z\sim1.5-2$ is very
close to the typical timescale when the AGNs residing in them stay in the
high-accretion-rate mode at these redshifts; for BC galaxies, the consistency
between the color transition timescale and the black hole strong accretion
lifetime is more likely to happen at lower redshifts ($z<1$). Our results
support the scenario where AGN accretion activities govern $UV$ color
transitions of host galaxies, making galaxies and their central SMBHs coevolve
with each other.

show exceptionally large changes in the luminosity, spectral shape, and/or
X-ray absorption. The most notable are the changes of the spectral type when
the source classified as a Seyfert 1 becomes a Seyfert 2 galaxy or vice versa.
Thus a name was coined of 'Changing-Look AGN' (CL AGN). The origin of this
phenomenon is still unknown, but for most of the sources, there are strong
arguments in favor of the intrinsic changes. Understanding the nature of such
rapid changes is a challenge to the models of black hole accretion flows since
the timescales of the changes are much shorter than the standard disk viscous
timescales. We aim to model the CL AGN phenomenon assuming that the underlying
mechanism is the time-dependent evolution of a black hole accretion disk
unstable due to the dominant radiation pressure. We use a 1-dimensional,
vertically integrated disk model, but we allow for the presence of the hot
coronal layer above the disk and the presence of the inner purely hot flow. We
focus on the variability timescales and amplitudes, which can be regulated by
the action of large-scale magnetic fields, the description of the disk-corona
coupling, and the presence of an inner optically thin flow, like
Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF). We compare model predictions for the
accretion disk around black hole mass 10$^7$M$_{\odot}$.

input variables whose gates compute the sum or the product of their inputs.
Positive AC -- that is, AC representing non-negative functions -- subsume many
interesting probabilistic models such as probabilistic sentential decision
diagram (PSDD) or sum-product network (SPN) on indicator variables. Efficient
algorithms for many operations useful in probabilistic reasoning on these
models critically depend on imposing structural restrictions to the underlying
AC. Generally, adding structural restrictions yields new tractable operations
but increases the size of the AC. In this paper we study the relative
succinctness of classes of AC with different combinations of common
restrictions. Building on existing results for Boolean circuits, we derive an
unconditional succinctness map for classes of monotone AC -- that is, AC whose
constant labels are non-negative reals -- respecting relevant combinations of
the restrictions we consider. We extend a small part of the map to classes of
positive AC. Those are known to generally be exponentially more succinct than
their monotone counterparts, but we observe here that for so-called
deterministic circuits there is no difference between the monotone and the
positive setting which allows us to lift some of our results. We end the paper
with some insights on the relative succinctness of positive AC by showing
exponential lower bounds on the representations of certain functions in

by a tidal interaction model. The optical counterpart of the plume is mainly
associated with the southern arm. The connecting part (base) of the plume
(directed eastwards) with NGC 3628 is located at the blueshifted (western) side
of NGC 3628. Two bases appear to be associated with the two arms of the plume.
A clump with reversed velocity gradient (relative to the velocity gradient of M
66) and a newly detected tail, i.e. M 66SE, is found in the southeast of M 66.
We suspect that M 66SE represents gas from NGC 3628 which was captured by M 66
in the recent interaction between the two galaxies. Meanwhile gas is falling
toward M 66, resulting in features already previously observed in the
southeastern part of M 66, e.g. large line widths and double peaks. An
upside-down `Y'-shaped HI gas component (M 65S) is detected in the south of M
65 which suggests that M 65 may also have been involved in the interaction. We

to forget its initial point during a warmup phase, the subsequent sampling
phase can be almost arbitrarily short. To determine if the resulting short
chains are reliable, we need to assess how close the Markov chains are to
convergence to their stationary distribution. The $\hat R$ statistic is a
general purpose and popular convergence diagnostic but unfortunately can
require a long sampling phase to work well. We present a nested design to
overcome this challenge and a generalization called nested $\hat R$. This new
diagnostic works under conditions similar to $\hat R$ and completes the MCMC
workflow for many GPU-friendly samplers. In addition, the proposed nesting
provides theoretical insights into the utility of $\hat R$, in both classical

role of NH-O hydrogen bonds in the formation of iodoplumbates monomers. Our
calculations indicate unbalanced reaction energies at several elementary
reaction steps in either DMF or DMSO. Mixing a small amount of DMSO in DMF

better equilibria in the overall crystallization process and better quality of

current concern. In response, recent research has proposed a plethora of new
fairness metrics, for example, the dozens of fairness metrics in the IBM AIF360
toolkit. This raises the question: How can any fairness tool satisfy such a
diverse range of goals? While we cannot completely simplify the task of
fairness testing, we can certainly reduce the problem. This paper shows that
many of those fairness metrics effectively measure the same thing. Based on
experiments using seven real-world datasets, we find that (a) 26 classification
metrics can be clustered into seven groups, and (b) four dataset metrics can be
clustered into three groups. Further, each reduced set may actually predict
different things. Hence, it is no longer necessary (or even possible) to
satisfy all fairness metrics. In summary, to simplify the fairness testing
problem, we recommend the following steps: (1)~determine what type of fairness
is desirable (and we offer a handful of such types); then (2) lookup those
types in our clusters; then (3) just test for one item per cluster.

understanding of high energy astrophysical phenomena. In order to reliably use
GRBs to this end, we first need to have a well-developed grasp of the mechanism
that produces the radiation within GRB jets and how that relates to their
structure. One model for the emission mechanism of GRBs invokes radiation
produced deep in the jet which eventually escapes the jet at its photosphere.
While this model has been able to explain a number of observed GRB
characteristics, it is currently lacking in predictive power and in ability to
fully reproduce GRB spectra. In order to address these shortcomings of the
model, we have expanded the capabilities of the MCRaT code, a state of the art
radiative transfer code that can now simulate optical to gamma ray radiation
propagating in a hydrodynamically simulated GRB jet. Using the MCRaT code, we
have constructed mock observed light curves, spectra, and polarization from
optical to gamma ray energies for the simulated GRBs. Using these mock
observables, we have compared our simulations of photospheric emission to
observations and found much agreement between the two. Furthermore, the MCRaT
calculations combined with the hydrodynamical simulations allow us to connect
the mock observables to the structure of the simulated GRB jet in a way that
was not previously possible. While there are a number of improvements that can
be made to the analyses, the steps taken here begin to pave the way for us to
fully understand the connection between the structure of a given GRB jet and
the radiation that would be expected from it.

predictions regarding the abundance of subhaloes. These predictions are
hampered by artificial disruption in numerical simulations, by large
halo-to-halo variance, and by the fact that the results depend on the baryonic
physics of galaxy formation. In particular, numerical simulations have shown
that the formation of a central disc can drastically reduce the abundance of
substructure compared to a dark matter-only simulation, which has been
attributed to enhanced destruction of substructure due to disc shocking. We
examine the impact of discs on substructure using the semi-analytical subhalo
model SatGen, which accurately models the tidal evolution of substructure free
of the numerical disruption that still hampers $N$-body simulations. Using a
sample of 10,000 merger trees of Milky Way-like haloes, we study the
demographics of subhaloes that are evolved under a range of composite halo-disc
potentials with unprecedented statistical power. We find that the overall
subhalo abundance is relatively insensitive to properties of the disc aside
from its total mass. For a disc that contains $5\%$ of $M_\mathrm{vir}$, the
mean subhalo abundance within $r_\mathrm{vir}$ is suppressed by
${\lesssim}10\%$ relative to the no-disc case, a difference that is dwarfed by
halo-to-halo variance. For the same disc mass, the abundance of subhaloes
within 50 kpc is reduced by ${\sim}30\%$. We argue that the disc mainly drives
excess mass loss for subhaloes with small pericentric radii and that the impact
of disc shocking is negligible.

production with statistics of dynamical observables. We introduce a
Thermo-Kinetic Relation to bound the entropy production or the non-adiabatic
(Hatano-Sasa, excess) entropy production for overdamped Markov jump processes,
possibly with time-varying rates and non stationary distributions. For
stationary cases, this bound is akin to a Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation,
only involving absolute fluctuations rather than the mean square, thereby
offering a better lower bound far from equilibrium. For non-stationary cases,
this bound generalises Classical Speed Limits, where the kinetic term is not
necessarily the activity (number of jumps) but any trajectory observable of
interest. As a consequence, in the task of driving a system from a given
probability distribution to another, we find a trade-off between non-adiabatic
entropy production and housekeeping entropy production: the latter can be
increased in order to decrease the former, although to a limited extent. We
also find constraints specific to constant-rate Markov processes. We illustrate
our Thermo-Kinetic Relations on simple examples from biophysics and computing
devices.

exceeding 200 $\mu$s at a magnetic field of 1.9 T. The $T_1$ values show a
strong dependence on the spin splitting, promising even longer $T_1$ at lower

last few years, most of the known guarantees are worst-case in nature, failing

problem at hand. In this paper we address the question of whether worst-case
lower bounds for regret in online learning of Markov decision processes (MDPs)
can be circumvented when information about the MDP, in the form of predictions
about its optimal $Q$-value function, is given to the algorithm. We show that
when the predictions about the optimal $Q$-value function satisfy a reasonably
weak condition we call distillation, then we can improve regret bounds by
replacing the set of state-action pairs with the set of state-action pairs on
which the predictions are grossly inaccurate. This improvement holds for both
uniform regret bounds and gap-based ones. Further, we are able to achieve this
property with an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret when given arbitrary
predictions (i.e., even those which are not a distillation). Our work extends a
recent line of work on algorithms with predictions, which has typically focused
on simple online problems such as caching and scheduling, to the more complex

The ion adsorption process is considered at the surface of carbon electrodes.
At the continuum scale, Darcy equation and advection-diffusion equation
governing water flow and solute transport through CDI cells are solved using
OpenFOAM. After validation against analytical solutions and previously
published results, the model is used to study the coupled water flow, ion
transport and adsorption at the pore and continuum scales. In the pore-scale
modeling, the effect of electrode microstructure, electrical potential and flow
velocity on the adsorption processes is quantitatively investigated, and the
relative importance of various parameters is determined. In addition, the
average adsorption rate derived from the pore-scale simulations is used in the
continuum model to simulate water desalination in a flow-through CDI cell. The
evolution of salt concentration during desalination has been quantified. It is
found that the electrode adsorption capability has a direct influence on
overall ion adsorption. Results also demonstrate that a narrower spacer between

phase inversion between each solar cycle in the sequence of four solar cycles,
20 to 23. The hypothesis advanced is that this feature is due to synchronicity
between solar activity and planetary alignment. An index of alignment between
Earth and Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn is shown to have dominant peaks of
alignment separated by 1.6 years in each solar cycle with, however, peak
alignments shifting by half a period, 0.8 years, between alternate solar
cycles. Accepting that solar activity increases when planets align would
explain the phase inversion in alternate solar cycles observed in the 1.6 year
quasi-biennial oscillation. Two new methods were developed to test this
hypothesis: (a) Narrow band filtering of solar activity with the pass band
based on the frequency content of the planetary alignment index. (b)
Superposing intervals of raw solar activity data centered on times of maximum
planet alignment. Both methods provided strong support for the hypothesis.
Planetary alignment is complex but predictable enabling the forecasting of

scientific computation. The datasets generated by the internet often correspond
to the analysis of high-dimensional sparse matrices. Notwithstanding recent
advances in the promotion of traditional singular value decomposition (SVD), an
efficient estimation algorithm for the rank of a high-dimensional sparse matrix
is still lacking. Inspired by the controllability theory of complex networks,
we converted the rank of a matrix into maximum matching computing. Then, we
established a fast rank estimation algorithm by using the cavity method, a
powerful approximate technique for computing the maximum matching, to estimate
the rank of a sparse matrix. In the merit of the natural low complexity of the
cavity method, we showed that the rank of a high-dimensional sparse matrix can
be estimated in a much faster way than SVD with high accuracy. Our method
offers an efficient pathway to quickly estimate the rank of the
high-dimensional sparse matrix when the time cost of computing the rank by SVD
is unacceptable.

early days, many developments have been made to improve the performance of the
system. PSNR of the received signal, secure transmission channel, quality of
encoding used, etc. are some of the key attributes of a good system. To ensure
security, the most commonly used technique is cryptography in which the message
is altered with respect to a key and using the same, the encoded message is
decoded at the receiver side. A complementary technique that is popularly used
to insure security is steganography. The advancements in Artificial
Intelligence(AI) have paved way for performing steganography in an intelligent,
tamper-proof manner. The recent discovery by researchers in the field of Deep
Learning(DL), an unsupervised learning network known as the Generative
Adversarial Networks(GAN) has improved the performance of this technique
exponentially. It has been demonstrated that deep neural networks are highly
sensitive to tiny perturbations of input data, giving rise to adversarial
examples. Though this property is usually considered a weakness of learned
models, it could be beneficial if used appropriately. The work that has been
accomplished by MIT for this purpose, a deep-neural model by the name of
SteganoGAN, has shown obligation for using this technique for steganography. In
this work, we have proposed a novel approach to improve the performance of the
existing system using latent space compression on the encoded data. This
theoretically would improve the performance exponentially. Thus, the algorithms
used to improve the system's performance and the results obtained have been
enunciated in this work. The results indicate the level of dominance this
system could achieve to be able to diminish the difficulties in solving
real-time problems in terms of security, deployment and database management.

fraction of end use energy consumed. Therefore, it is important to provide the
occupant comfort requirements in buildings in an energy efficient manner.
However, buildings are large scale complex systems, susceptible to sensor,
actuator or communication network failures in their thermal control
infrastructure, that can affect their performance in terms of occupant comfort
and energy efficiency. The degree of decentralization in the control
architecture determines a fundamental tradeoff between performance and
robustness. This thesis studies the problem of thermal control of buildings
from the perspective of partitioning them into clusters for decentralized
control, to balance underlying performance and robustness requirements.
Measures of deviation in performance and robustness between centralized and
decentralized architectures in the Model Predictive Control framework are
derived. Appropriate clustering algorithms are then proposed to determine
decentralized control architectures which provide a satisfactory trade-off
between the underlying performance and robustness objectives. Two different
partitioning methodologies the CLF-MCS method and the OLF-FPM method are
developed and compared. The problem of decentralized control design based on
the architectures obtained using these methodologies is also considered. It
entails the use of decentralized extended state observers to address the issue
of unavailability of unknown states and disturbances in the system. The
potential use of the proposed control architecture selection and decentralized
control design methodologies is demonstrated in simulation on a real world

Simultaneously the need for interpretable prediction- and classification
methods is increasing, as this improves both our trust in these models and the
amount of information we can abstract from data. An important aspect of this
interpretability is to obtain insight in the sensitivity-specificity trade-off
constituted by multiple plausible input-output relationships. These are often
shown in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. These developments
combined lead to the need for a method that can abstract complex yet
interpretable input-output relationships from large data, i.e. data containing
large numbers of samples and sample features. Boolean phrases in disjunctive
normal form (DNF) are highly suitable for explaining non-linear input-output
relationships in a comprehensible way. Mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
can be used to abstract these Boolean phrases from binary data, though its
computational complexity prohibits the analysis of large datasets. This work
presents IRELAND, an algorithm that allows for abstracting Boolean phrases in
DNF from data with up to 10,000 samples and sample characteristics. The results
show that for large datasets IRELAND outperforms the current state-of-the-art

individual realizations of idealized measurements of photons that have been
absorbed and subsequently emitted as fluorescence. The quantum nature of the
single photon input requires a fully quantum model of both the input and output
light fields. We show that PSII coupled to the field via three collective
``bright states'', whose orientation and distribution correlate strongly with
its natural geometry. Measurements of the transmitted beam strongly affects the
system state, since a (null) detection of the outgoing photon confirms that the
system must be in the electronic (excited) ground state. Using numerical and
analytical calculations we show that observing the null result transforms a
state with a low excited state population $O( 10^{-5} )$ to a state with nearly
all population contained in the excited states. This is solely a property of
the single photon input, as we confirm by comparing this behavior with that for
excitation by a coherent state possessing an average of one photon, using a
smaller five site ``pentamer'' system. We also examine the effect of a
dissipative phononic environment on the conditional excited state dynamics. We
show that the environment has a strong effect on the observed rates of
fluorescence, which could act as a new photon-counting witness of excitonic
coherence. The long time evolution of the phononic model predicts an

log-frequency correlation measure on spectral densities that gives the temporal
evolution of the distribution of frequency ratios (rational or irrational) in
between two signals, using analytic wavelets. We illustrate these concepts on
numerical signals (sums of sine functions) and voice recordings from the
Voice-Icar-Federico II database. Finally, with a second correlation operation
from two of these ratio distributions (a reference one, the other from the

of electromagnetic (EM) waves with unitary efficiency and relatively simple
fabrication requirements. Herein, two-dimensional (2D) metagratings composed of
a 2D periodic array of rectangular holes in a metallic medium are proposed for
diffraction pattern control. We first present an analytical method for
diffraction analysis of 2D compound metallic metagrating (a periodic metallic
structure with more than one rectangular hole in each period). Closed-form and
analytical expressions are presented for the reflection coefficients of
diffracted orders for the first time. Next, we verify the proposed method's
results against full-wave simulations and demonstrate their excellent
agreement. As a proof of principle, two applications are presented using the
proposed analytical method. The first application is a perfect out-of-plane
reflector that transfers a normal transverse-magnetic (TM) polarized plane wave
to an oblique transverse-electric (TE) polarized plane wave in the $y-z$ plane.
The second one is a five-channel beam splitter with an arbitrary power
distribution between channels. Using the proposed analytical method, we
designed these metagratings without requiring even a single optimization in a
full-wave solver. The performance of the designed metagratings is better than
previously reported structures in terms of power efficiency and relative
distribution error. Our analytical results reveals that 2D metagratings can be
used for manipulating EM waves in the plane and out of the plane of incidence
with very high efficiency, thereby leading to extensive applications in a wide
range of frequencies from microwave to terahertz (THz) regimes.

most promising emerging non-volatile memories for flexible electronics because
of its simple structure and low fabrication cost. The reported switching
mechanism can be classified into either localized or bulk effect. The localized
effect is commonly observed in GO-RRAM with active electrode e.g. Cu and Al.
The switching mechanism includes metallic conduction filament evolution or
modification of interfacial resistance between GO layer and electrodes. On the
other hand, the bulk effect involves hybridization state change of the entire
GO layer and is typically observed in devices with inert electrode e.g. Pt and
Au. Numerous compact models have been proposed for RRAM that are based on
localized switching mechanism. However, compact modeling of GO-RRAM based on
bulk mechanism is still lacking. Thus, this paper presents a compact model for
GO-RRAM that relies on hybridization state modulation. The proposed model
associates the resistance switching mechanism with the electricaldriven
modification of sp2 clusters density in the switching layer. A SPICE model
incorporating the proposed compact model is developed for parameter
calibration. The simulated I-V characteristic exhibits strong correlation with
