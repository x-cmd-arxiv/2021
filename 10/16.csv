mechanism behind the pre-trained language models (PLMs). Despite the growing
progress of probing knowledge for PLMs in the general domain, specialised areas
such as biomedical domain are vastly under-explored. To catalyse the research
in this direction, we release a well-curated biomedical knowledge probing
benchmark, MedLAMA, which is constructed based on the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. We test a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art PLMs
and probing approaches on our benchmark, reaching at most 3% of acc@10. While
highlighting various sources of domain-specific challenges that amount to this
underwhelming performance, we illustrate that the underlying PLMs have a higher
potential for probing tasks. To achieve this, we propose Contrastive-Probe, a
novel self-supervised contrastive probing approach, that adjusts the underlying
PLMs without using any probing data. While Contrastive-Probe pushes the acc@10
to 28%, the performance gap still remains notable. Our human expert evaluation
suggests that the probing performance of our Contrastive-Probe is still
under-estimated as UMLS still does not include the full spectrum of factual
knowledge. We hope MedLAMA and Contrastive-Probe facilitate further
developments of more suited probing techniques for this domain.

historically characterized as being localized (Frenkel) excitons that emerge
from the atomic $d{-}d$ transitions between the Cr-3$d$-$t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$
orbitals. The argument has gathered strength in recent years as the excitons in
recently made monolayers are found at almost the same energies as the bulk. The
Laporte rule, which restricts such parity forbidden atomic transitions, can
relax if, at least, one element is present: spin-orbit coupling, odd-parity
phonons or Jahn-Teller distortion. While what can be classified as a purely
Frenkel exciton is a matter of definition, we show using an advanced first
principles parameter-free approach that these excitons in CrX$_{3}$, in both
its bulk and monolayer variants, have band-origin and do not require the
relaxation of Laporte rule as a fundamental principle. We show that, the
character of these excitons is mostly determined by the Cr-$d$ orbital
manifold, nevertheless, they appear only as a consequence of X-p states
hybridizing with the Cr-$d$. The hybridization enhances as the halogen atom
becomes heavier, bringing the X-$p$ states closer to the Cr-$d$ states in the
sequence Cl{\textrightarrow}Br{\textrightarrow}I, with an attendant increase in
exciton intensity and decrease in binding energy. By applying a range of
different kinds of perturbations, we show that, moderate changes to the
two-particle Hamiltonian that essentially modifies the Cr-$d$-X-$p$
hybridization, can alter both the intensities and positions of the exciton
peaks. A detailed analysis of several deep lying excitons, with and without
strain, reveals that the exciton is most Frenkel like in CrCl$_{3}$ and
acquires mixed Frenkel-Wannier character in CrI$_{3}$.

strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. Unfortunately, most standard
multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques, such as self-play (SP) or
population play (PP), produce agents that overfit to their training partners
and do not generalize well to humans. Alternatively, researchers can collect
human data, train a human model using behavioral cloning, and then use that
model to train ""human-aware"" agents (""behavioral cloning play"", or BCP). While
such an approach can improve the generalization of agents to new human
co-players, it involves the onerous and expensive step of collecting large
amounts of human data first. Here, we study the problem of how to train agents
that collaborate well with human partners without using human data. We argue
that the crux of the problem is to produce a diverse set of training partners.
Drawing inspiration from successful multi-agent approaches in competitive
domains, we find that a surprisingly simple approach is highly effective. We
train our agent partner as the best response to a population of self-play
agents and their past checkpoints taken throughout training, a method we call
Fictitious Co-Play (FCP). Our experiments focus on a two-player collaborative
cooking simulator that has recently been proposed as a challenge problem for
coordination with humans. We find that FCP agents score significantly higher

Furthermore, humans also report a strong subjective preference to partnering
with FCP agents over all baselines.

how it is possible to bury the paradox into approximate DP's delta parameter.
We develop a few mechanisms for one-sided padding mechanisms that always give
conservative answers, but still achieve approximate differential privacy. We
show how these mechanisms can be applied in a few select areas including making
the cardinalities of set intersections and unions revealed in Private Set

answer choice. We find that models often rely on stereotypes when the context
is under-informative, meaning the model's outputs consistently reproduce
harmful biases in this setting. Though models are more accurate when the
context provides an informative answer, they still rely on stereotypes and
average up to 3.4 percentage points higher accuracy when the correct answer
aligns with a social bias than when it conflicts, with this difference widening
to over 5 points on examples targeting gender for most models tested.

operators, specified in terms of a constant phase shift in a free-fermionic
basis. From the physical point of view this $\tau$-function has multiple
interpretations: as a correlator of Jordan-Wigner strings, a Loschmidt Echo in
the Aharonov-Bohm effect, or the generating function of the local densities in
the Tonks-Girardeau gas. We present the $\tau$-function as a form-factors
series and tackle it from four vantage points: (i) we perform an exact
summation and express it in terms of a Fredholm determinant in the
thermodynamic limit, (ii) we use bosonization techniques to perform partial
summations of soft modes around the Fermi surface to acquire the scaling at
zero temperature, (iii) we derive large space and time asymptotic behavior for
the thermal Fredholm determinant by relating it to effective form-factors with
an asymptotically similar kernel, and (iv) we identify and sum the important
basis elements directly through a tailor-made numerical algorithm for
finite-entropy states in a free-fermionic Hilbert space. All methods confirm
each other. We find that, in addition to the exponential decay in the
finite-temperature case the dynamic correlation functions exhibit an extra
power law in time, universal over any distribution and time scale.

coKleisli category of the pebbling comonad specifies equivalences under
different fragments and extensions of infinitary k-variable logic. Moreover,
the coalgebras over this pebbling comonad characterise treewidth and correspond
to tree decompositions. In this paper we introduce the pebble-relation comonad,
which characterises pathwidth and whose coalgebras correspond to path
decompositions. We further show that the existence of a coKleisli morphism in
this comonad is equivalent to truth preservation in the restricted conjunction
fragment of k-variable infinitary logic. We do this using Dalmau's
pebble-relation game and an equivalent all-in-one pebble game. We then provide
a similar treatment to the corresponding coKleisli isomorphisms via a bijective

polynomial rings for both two-generation scenario and three-generation
scenario. However, Wang et al.'s claim of the finiteness of the generating sets
of the polynomial rings and their calculation by the approach of Hilbert series
with generalized Molien-Weyl formula are both based on their assertion that the
unitary group ${\rm U}(n,\mathbb{C})$ is reductive, which is unfortunately
incorrect. The property of being reductive is only applicable to linear
algebraic groups. And it is well-known that the unitary group ${\rm
U}(n,\mathbb{C})$ is not even a linear algebraic group. In this paper, we point
out the above issue and provide a solution to fill in the accompanying logical
gaps in [JHEP 09 (2021) 053]. Some important results from the theory of linear
algebraic group, the invariant theory of square matrices and group theory are
needed in the analysis. We also clarify some somewhat misleading or vague
statements in [JHEP 09 (2021) 053] about the scope of flavor invariants. Note
that, although built from incorrect assertion, Wang et al.'s calculation
results in [JHEP 09 (2021) 053] are nonetheless correct, which is ultimately
because the ring of invariants of ${\rm U}(n,\mathbb{C})$ is isomorphic to that
of ${\rm GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ which is itself reductive.

Our proposed NNK-Means, unlike previous DL techniques, such as kSVD, learns
geometric dictionaries with atoms that are representative of the input data
space. Experiments show that summarization using NNK-Means can provide better
class separation compared to linear and kernel versions of kMeans and kSVD.
Moreover, NNK-Means is scalable, with runtime complexity similar to that of
kMeans.

dysarthric speech while preserving the speaker identity. Such a framework is
essential for (1) clinical decision making processes and alleviation of patient
stress, (2) data augmentation for dysarthric speech recognition. This is an
especially challenging task since the converted samples should capture the
severity of dysarthric speech while being highly natural and possessing the
speaker identity of the normal speaker. To this end, we adopted a two-stage
framework, which consists of a sequence-to-sequence model and a nonparallel
frame-wise model. Objective and subjective evaluations were conducted on the
UASpeech dataset, and results showed that the method was able to yield
reasonable naturalness and capture severity aspects of the pathological speech.
On the other hand, the similarity to the normal source speaker's voice was
limited and requires further improvements.

  Speech Synthesis in Simultaneous Speech-to-Speech Translation","Accepted by Interspeech 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) converts input speech to speech in
another language. A challenge of delivering S2ST in real time is the
accumulated delay between the translation and speech synthesis modules. While
recently incremental text-to-speech (iTTS) models have shown large quality
improvements, they typically require additional future text inputs to reach
optimal performance. In this work, we minimize the initial waiting time of iTTS
by adapting the upstream speech translator to generate high-quality pseudo
lookahead for the speech synthesizer. After mitigating the initial delay, we
demonstrate that the duration of synthesized speech also plays a crucial role
on latency. We formalize this as a latency metric and then present a simple yet
effective duration-scaling approach for latency reduction. Our approaches
consistently reduce latency by 0.2-0.5 second without sacrificing speech
translation quality.

is not infinitely floppy and instead exhibits a tunable mechanical response

us to explore the properties of planar and spatial assemblies of
neutrally-stable elements and also pose and solve the inverse problem of
designing assemblies that can morph from one given shape into another. Simple

the three-dimensional standard flat torus, in particular the asymptotic
distribution of the nodal intersection length against a fixed regular reference
surface. Expectation and variance have been addressed by Maffucci (2019) who
found that the expected length is proportional to the square root of the
eigenvalue times the area of the surface, while the asymptotic variance only
depends on the geometry of the surface, the projected lattice points being
equidistributed on the two-dimensional unit sphere in the high-energy limit. He
also noticed that there are ``special'' surfaces, so-called static, for which
the variance is of smaller order; however he did not prescribe the precise
asymptotic law in this case. In this paper, we study second order fluctuations
of the nodal intersection length. Our first main result is a Central Limit
Theorem for ``generic'' surfaces, while for static ones, a sphere or a
hemisphere e.g., our main results are a non-Central Limit Theorem and a precise
asymptotic law for the variance of the nodal intersection length, conditioned
on the existence of so-called well-separated sequences of Laplacian
eigenvalues. It turns out that, in this regime, the nodal area investigated by
Cammarota (2019) is asymptotically fully correlated with the length of the
nodal intersections against any sphere. The main ingredients for our proofs are
the Kac-Rice formula for moments, the chaotic decomposition for square
integrable functionals of Gaussian fields, and some arithmetic estimates that
may be of independent interest.

concepts (e.g. objects and categories) for which a question could be generated,
but models are trained to mimic an arbitrary choice of concept as given in
their training data. This makes training difficult and also poses issues for
evaluation -- multiple valid questions exist for most images but only one or a
few are captured by the human references. We present Guiding Visual Question
Generation - a variant of VQG which conditions the question generator on
categorical information based on expectations on the type of question and the
objects it should explore. We propose two variants: (i) an explicitly guided
model that enables an actor (human or automated) to select which objects and
categories to generate a question for; and (ii) an implicitly guided model that
learns which objects and categories to condition on, based on discrete latent
variables. The proposed models are evaluated on an answer-category augmented
VQA dataset and our quantitative results show a substantial improvement over
the current state of the art (over 9 BLEU-4 increase). Human evaluation
validates that guidance helps the generation of questions that are
grammatically coherent and relevant to the given image and objects.

Ce$_{3}$Bi$_{4}$Pd$_{3}$ becomes more insulating under pressure, which is a

increases quadratically with pressure, similar to the behavior observed in the

a different sub-network for each input sample during deployment. However,
current dynamic methods rely on learning a continuous channel gating through
regularization by inducing sparsity loss. This formulation introduces
complexity in balancing different losses (e.g task loss, regularization loss).
In addition, regularization based methods lack transparent tradeoff
hyperparameter selection to realize a computational budget. Our contribution is
two-fold: 1) decoupled task and pruning losses. 2) Simple hyperparameter
selection that enables FLOPs reduction estimation before training. Inspired by
the Hebbian theory in Neuroscience: ""neurons that fire together wire together"",
we propose to predict a mask to process k filters in a layer based on the
activation of its previous layer. We pose the problem as a self-supervised
binary classification problem. Each mask predictor module is trained to predict
if the log-likelihood for each filter in the current layer belongs to the top-k
activated filters. The value k is dynamically estimated for each input based on
a novel criterion using the mass of heatmaps. We show experiments on several
neural architectures, such as VGG, ResNet and MobileNet on CIFAR and ImageNet

After being injected with a backdoor, a deep neural model will behave normally

that can make existing textual backdoor attacks much more harmful. The first
trick is to add an extra training task to distinguish poisoned and clean data
during the training of the victim model, and the second one is to use all the
clean training data rather than remove the original clean data corresponding to
the poisoned data. These two tricks are universally applicable to different
attack models. We conduct experiments in three tough situations including clean
data fine-tuning, low-poisoning-rate, and label-consistent attacks.
Experimental results show that the two tricks can significantly improve attack

ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). These outflows are optically thick and can
reprocess a significant fraction of the accretion luminosity. Assuming
isotropic emission, escaping radiation from the outflow's photosphere has the
potential to irradiate the outer disc. Here, we explore how the atmosphere of
the outer disc would respond to such irradiation, and specifically whether
unstable heating may lead to significant mass loss via thermally-driven winds.
We find that, for a range of physically relevant system parameters, this mass
loss may actually switch off the inflow entirely and potentially drive
limit-cycle behaviour (likely modulated on the timescale of the outer disc). In
ULXs harbouring neutron stars, magnetic fields tend to have a slight
destabilizing effect; for the strongest magnetic fields and highest accretion
rates, this can push otherwise stable systems into the unstable regime. We
explore the prevalence of the instability in a simulated sample of ULXs
obtained from a binary population synthesis calculation. We find that almost
all neutron star and black hole ULXs with Eddington-scaled accretion rates of
$\dot{m}_0 < 100$ should be able to drive powerful outflows from their outer
discs. Several known ULXs are expected to lie in this regime; the persistence
of accretion in these sources implies the irradiation may be anisotropic which
can be reconciled with the inferred reprocessed (optical) emission if some of
this originates in the wind photosphere or irradiation of the secondary star.

truncate the interacting Hamiltonian to a finite-dimensional space of states

below some energy cutoff $E_\text{max}$. In this work, we show how to treat
Hamiltonian truncation systematically using effective field theory methodology.
We define the finite-dimensional effective Hamiltonian by integrating out the
states above $E_\text{max}$. The effective Hamiltonian can be computed by
matching a transition amplitude to the full theory, and gives corrections order
by order as an expansion in powers of $1/E_\text{max}$. The effective
Hamiltonian is non-local, with the non-locality controlled in an expansion in
powers of $H_0/E_\text{max}$. The effective Hamiltonian is also non-Hermitian,
and we discuss whether this is a necessary feature or an artifact of our
definition. We apply our formalism to 2D $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, and compute
the the leading $1/E_\text{max}^2$ corrections to the effective Hamiltonian. We
show that these corrections non-trivially satisfy the crucial property of
separation of scales. Numerical diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian
gives residual errors of order $1/E_\text{max}^3$, as expected by our power

point is the observation that quantum fluctuations of fields are the more

notion of spacetime distance, including the metric as its infinitesimal
version, can be replaced by the notion of correlation strength. This suggests a
new picture in which abstract (2-point and multi-point) correlators are the
primary structure. In general, these abstract correlators can only be described
as information theoretic structures and, in principle, they need not bear any
relationship to quantum fields or spacetimes. These correlators may allow
approximations, however, so that, in certain regimes, they can be
mathematically approximately represented as the 2-point and multi-point
functions of quantum fields living on a spacetime. In this way, the standard
picture of a curved spacetime with fields whose correlators arise from Feynman

description of the NESS. Furthermore, we estimate the Liouvillian gap by
exploiting a Majorana canonical basis as the basis of super-operators. In this
manner we show that the Liouvillian gap can remain finite in the thermodynamic

Additionally, we show that the character of the gap with respect to the
anisotropy parameter differs depending on the phase of the XY model. The change
of character corresponds to the quantum phase transition of the XY model.

information about the thermal structure and the mass accretion process as it
can inform about the occurrence of recent ($\lesssim$1,000 yr) accretion
bursts. In addition, the ability to image water emission makes these sources
excellent laboratories to test indirect snowline tracers such as
H$^{13}$CO$^+$. We study the water snowline in five protostellar envelopes in
Perseus using a suite of molecular line observations taken with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at
$\sim$0.2$^{\prime\prime}-$0.7$^{\prime\prime}$ (60--210 au) resolution. B1-c
provides a textbook example of compact H$_2^{18}$O ($3_{1,3}-2_{2,0}$) and HDO
($3_{1,2}-2_{2,1}$) emission surrounded by a ring of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ ($J=2-1$)
and HC$^{18}$O$^+$ ($J=3-2$). Compact HDO surrounded by H$^{13}$CO$^+$ is also
detected toward B1-bS. The optically thick main isotopologue HCO$^+$ is not
suited to trace the snowline and HC$^{18}$O$^+$ is a better tracer than
H$^{13}$CO$^+$ due to a lower contribution from the outer envelope. However,
since a detailed analysis is needed to derive a snowline location from
H$^{13}$CO$^+$ or HC$^{18}$O$^+$ emission, their true value as snowline tracer
will lie in the application in sources where water cannot be readily detected.
For protostellar envelopes, the most straightforward way to locate the water
snowline is through observations of H$_2^{18}$O or HDO. Including all
sub-arcsecond resolution water observations from the literature, we derive an
average burst interval of $\sim$10,000 yr, but high-resolution water
observations of a larger number of protostars is required to better constrain

this, we explore 3 notable secondary features in enrichment (found in three
different case-study galaxies) that arise from a galaxy merger or bursty star
formation. First, we observe a secondary track with a lower [Mg/Fe] than the
main trend. At z = 0, stars from this track are predominantly found within 2-6
kpc of the center; they were accreted in a 1:3 total-mass-ratio merger ~ 0.4
Gyr ago. Second, we find a distinct elemental bi-modality that forms following
a strong burst in star formation in a galaxy at t_lookback ~ 10 Gyr. This burst
quenched star formation for ~ 0.66 Gyr, allowing Ia supernovae to enrich the
system with iron before star formation resumed. Third, we examine stripes in
enrichment that run roughly orthogonal to the dominant [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H]
trend; these stripes correspond to short bursts of star formation during which
core-collapse supernovae enrich the surrounding medium with Mg (and Fe) on
short timescales. If observed, these features would substantiate the utility of
elemental abundances in revealing the assembly and star formation histories of
dwarf galaxies. We explore the observability of these features for upcoming
spectroscopic studies. Our results show that precise measurements of elemental
abundance patterns can reveal critical events in the formation histories of
low-mass galaxies.

organic para-sexiphenyl molecule (p-6P) on amorphous silicon dioxide
($\alpha$-SiO$_2$) by means of atomistically resolved classical molecular
dynamics computer simulations. We use a simulation model that mimics the
experimental deposition from the vapor and subsequent self-assembly onto the
underlying surface. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed
orientational changes from lying to upright standing configurations of the
grown layers. We demonstrate that the increase in the number of fluorinated
groups inside the p-6P leads to a smoother, layer-by-layer growth on the
$\alpha$-SiO$_2$ surface: We observe that in the first layers, due to strong
molecule-substrate interactions the molecules first grow in chiral (fan-like)
structures, where each consecutive molecule has a higher angle, supported by
molecules lying underneath. Subsequently deposited molecules bind to the
already standing molecules of the chiral structures until all molecules are
standing. The growth of chiral islands is the main mechanism for growth of the
fluorinated p-6P derivative, while the p-6P, due to the lower interaction with
the underlying substrate, forms less chiral structures. This leads to a lower
energy barrier for step-edge crossing for the fluorinated molecules. We find
that partial fluorination of the p-6P molecule can in this way significantly
alter its growth behaviour by modifying the rough, 3D growth into a smooth,
layer-by-layer growth. This has implications for the rational design of
molecules and their functionalized forms which could be tailored for a desired
growth behavior and structure formation.

that electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) angular crossings, which are the

the stellar rotation facilitates the occurrence of FFC. The
low-electron-fraction region in the post-shock layer expands by centrifugal
force, enhancing the disparity of neutrino absorption between electron-type
neutrinos ($\nu_{\rm e}$) and their anti-particles ($\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$). This
has a significant impact on the angular distribution of neutrinos in momentum
space, in which $\nu_{\rm e}$ tends to be more isotropic than $\bar{\nu}_{\rm
e}$; consequently, ELN crossings emerge. The ELN crossing found in this study
is clearly associated with rotation, which motivates further investigation on
how the subsequent FFC influences explosion dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and
neutrino signals in rotating CCSNe.

be more serious than it looks: It harms our credibility in ways that can make
it harder to mitigate present-day harms, like those involving biased systems
for content moderation or resume screening. It also limits our ability to
prepare for the potentially enormous impacts of more distant future advances.
This paper urges researchers to be careful about these claims and suggests some
research directions and communication strategies that will make it easier to
avoid or rebut them.

time-series anomaly detection mainly use deep autoencoders to solve this

reconstruction error on abnormal inputs. However, in practice, autoencoders can
reconstruct anomalies so well, due to powerful capabilites of neural networks.
Besides, these approaches can be ineffective for identifying non-point

contention in concurrent systems. Traditionally, mutual exclusion algorithms
have been designed under the assumption that a process does not fail while
acquiring/releasing a lock or while executing its critical section. However,
failures do occur in real life, potentially leaving the lock in an inconsistent
state. This gives rise to the problem of recoverable mutual exclusion (RME)
that involves designing a mutual exclusion (ME) algorithm that can tolerate
failures, while maintaining safety and liveness properties.
  In this work, we present a framework that transforms any algorithm that
solves the RME problem into an algorithm that can also simultaneously adapt to
(1) the number of processes competing for the lock, as well as (2) the number
of failures that have occurred in the recent past, while maintaining the
correctness and performance properties of the underlying RME algorithm.
Additionally, the algorithm constructed as a result of this transformation adds
certain desirable properties like fairness (a variation of FCFS) and bounded
recovery. Assume that the worst-case RMR complexity of a critical section
request in the underlying RME algorithm is $R(n)$. Then, our framework yields
an RME algorithm for which the worst-case RMR complexity of a critical section
request is given by $\mathcal{O}(\min \{\ddot{c}, \sqrt{F+1}, R(n)\})$, where
$\ddot{c}$ denotes the point contention of the request and $F$ denotes the
number of failures in the recent past of the request.
  We further extend our framework by presenting a novel memory reclamation
algorithm to bound the worst-case space complexity of the RME algorithm. The
memory reclamation techniques maintain the fairness, performance and
correctness properties of our transformation and is general enough to be
employed to bound the space of other RME algorithms.

realization of most precubical sets, though their colimits are not so easy to
determine (in comparison with colimits in the category of d-spaces for
example). We use the plural here, as the notion of a locally ordered space vary
from an author to another, only differing according to seemingly anodyne
technical details. As we explain in this article, these differences have
dramatic consequences on colimits. In particular, we show that most categories
of locally ordered spaces are not cocomplete, thus answering a question that
was neglected so far. The strategy is the following: given a directed loop
{\gamma} on a locally ordered space X, we try to identify the image of {\gamma}
with a single point. If it were taken in the category of d-spaces, such an
identification would be likely to create a vortex, while locally ordered spaces
have no vortices. Concretely, the antisymmetry of local orders gets more points
to be identified than in a mere topological quotient. However, the effect of
this phenomenon is in some sense limited to the neighbourhood of (the image of)
{\gamma}. So the existence and the nature of the corresponding coequalizer
strongly depends on the topology around the image of {\gamma}. As an extreme
example, if the latter forms a connected component, the coequalizer exists and
its underlying space matches with the topological coequalizer.

mechanistic models, simulation of which is computationally intensive and does
not provide a simplified understanding of the mechanisms driving the overall
dynamics. For such systems, lower-order models can prove useful to enable
sustainability analysis through coupled dynamical analysis. There have been few
attempts at finding low-order models of manufacturing and natural systems, with
existing work focused on model development of individual mechanism level. This
work seeks to fill this current gap in the literature of developing simplified
dynamical models for these systems by developing reduced-order models using a
machine learning (ML) approach. The approach is demonstrated on an entire
soybean-oil to soybean-diesel process plant and a lake system. We use a
grey-box ML method with a standard nonlinear optimization approach to identify
relevant models of governing dynamics as ODEs using the data simulated from
mechanistic models. Results show that the method identifies a high accuracy
linear ODE models for the process plant, reflective of underlying linear
stoichiometric mechanisms and mass balance driving the dynamics. For the
natural systems, we modify the ML approach to include the effect of past
dynamics, which gives non-linear ODE. While the modified approach provides a
better match to dynamics of stream flow, it falls short of completely
recreating the dynamics. We conclude that the proposed ML approach work well
for systems where dynamics is smooth, such as in manufacturing plant whereas
does not work perfectly well in case of chaotic dynamics such as water stream
flow.

analyze the working of loss functions. For our case, we will use two sets of
loss functions, generalized loss functions like Binary cross-entropy or BCE and
specialized loss functions like Dice loss or focal loss. Through a series of
experiments, we will establish whether combining different loss functions is
better than using a single loss function and if yes, then what is the reason
behind it. In order to establish the difference between generalized loss and
specialized losses, we will train several models using the above-mentioned
losses and then compare their robustness on adversarial examples. In
particular, we will look at how fast the accuracy of different models decreases

  Novel Ensemble Architecture",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Membership inference attacks are a key measure to evaluate privacy leakage in
machine learning (ML) models. These attacks aim to distinguish training members
from non-members by exploiting differential behavior of the models on member
and non-member inputs. The goal of this work is to train ML models that have
high membership privacy while largely preserving their utility; we therefore
aim for an empirical membership privacy guarantee as opposed to the provable
privacy guarantees provided by techniques like differential privacy, as such
techniques are shown to deteriorate model utility. Specifically, we propose a
new framework to train privacy-preserving models that induces similar behavior
on member and non-member inputs to mitigate membership inference attacks. Our
framework, called SELENA, has two major components. The first component and the
core of our defense is a novel ensemble architecture for training. This
architecture, which we call Split-AI, splits the training data into random
subsets, and trains a model on each subset of the data. We use an adaptive
inference strategy at test time: our ensemble architecture aggregates the
outputs of only those models that did not contain the input sample in their
training data. We prove that our Split-AI architecture defends against a large
family of membership inference attacks, however, it is susceptible to new
adaptive attacks. Therefore, we use a second component in our framework called
Self-Distillation to protect against such stronger attacks. The
Self-Distillation component (self-)distills the training dataset through our
Split-AI ensemble, without using any external public datasets. Through
extensive experiments on major benchmark datasets we show that SELENA presents
a superior trade-off between membership privacy and utility compared to the
state of the art.

high interpretability, and incorporates an estimation of the prediction
reliability which is not usually available. By combining these features in the
same approach we expect that it can boost the confidence of physicians to use
such a tool in their daily activity. In order to achieve the mentioned goals, a
three-step methodology was developed: several rules were created by
dichotomizing risk factors; such rules were trained with a machine learning
classifier to predict the acceptance degree of each rule (the probability that
the rule is correct) for each patient; that information was combined and used
to compute the risk of mortality and the reliability of such prediction. The
methodology was applied to a dataset of patients admitted with any type of
acute coronary syndromes (ACS), to assess the 30-days all-cause mortality risk.
The performance was compared with state-of-the-art approaches: logistic
regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and clinical risk score model
(Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events - GRACE). The proposed approach
achieved testing results identical to the standard LR, but offers superior
interpretability and personalization; it also significantly outperforms the
GRACE risk model and the standard ANN model. The calibration curve also
suggests a very good generalization ability of the obtained model as it
approaches the ideal curve. Finally, the reliability estimation of individual
predictions presented a great correlation with the misclassifications rate.
Those properties may have a beneficial application in other clinical scenarios

critical points (TQCPs) where quantum phase transitions between two topological
distinct superconducting states take place. We illustrate that while
superconducting phases on both sides of TQCPs spontaneously break same
symmetries, universality classes of critical states can be identified only when
global symmetries in topological states are further specified. In dimensions
$d=2,3$, we find that continuous $(d+1)$th order transitions at weakly
interacting TQCPs that were pointed out previously in the presence of emergent
Lorentz symmetry can be terminated by strongly interacting fixed points of
majorana fields. For $2d$ time reversal symmetry breaking TQCPs, termination
points are supersymmetric with ${\mathcal N}=4N_f={1}$ (where $N_f$ is the
number of four-component Dirac fermions and ${\mathcal N}$ is the number of
two-component real fermions) beyond which transitions are discontinuous first
order ones. For $2d$ time reversal symmetric TQCPs without other global
symmetries, termination points of $(d+1)$th order continuous transition lines
are generically conformal invariant without supersymmetry. Beyond these strong
coupling fixed points, there are first-order discontinuous transitions as far
as the protecting symmetry is not spontaneously broken but no direct
transitions if the protecting symmetry is spontaneously broken in the presence
of strong interactions. In $3d$, strong coupling termination points can be
further effectively represented by new emergent gapless real bosons weakly
coupled with free gapless majorana fermions. However, in $1d$, time reversal
symmetric $(d+1)$th continuous transition lines of TQCPs are terminated by
simple free majorana fermion fixed points.

paper presents a novel deep neural network-based particle tracing method to
explore time-varying vector fields represented by Lagrangian flow maps. In our
workflow, in situ processing is first utilized to extract Lagrangian flow maps,
and deep neural networks then use the extracted data to learn flow field
behavior. Using a trained model to predict new particle trajectories offers a
fixed small memory footprint and fast inference. To demonstrate and evaluate
the proposed method, we perform an in-depth study of performance using a

scientific mobility, and has been the subject of considerable policy debate.
However, tracking the migration life courses of researchers is challenging due
to data limitations. In this study, we use Scopus bibliometric data on eight
million publications from 1.1 million researchers who have published at least
once with an affiliation address from Germany in 1996-2020. We construct the
partial life histories of published researchers in this period and explore both
their out-migration and the subsequent return of a subset of this group: the
returnees. Our analyses shed light on the career stages and gender disparities
between researchers who remain in Germany, those who emigrate, and those who
eventually return. We find that the return migration streams are even more
gender imbalanced, which points to the need for additional efforts to encourage
female researchers to come back to Germany. We document a slightly declining
trend in return migration among more recent cohorts of researchers who left
Germany, which, for most disciplines, was associated with a decrease in the
German collaborative ties of these researchers. Moreover, we find that the
gender disparities for the most gender imbalanced disciplines are unlikely to
be mitigated by return migration given the gender compositions of the cohorts
of researchers who have left Germany and of those who have returned. This
analysis uncovers new dimensions of migration among scholars by investigating
the return migration of published researchers, which is critical for the
development of science policy.

growth and dissipation of Be star discs in systems where the binary orbit is
misaligned with respect to the spin axis of the primary star. We investigate
six different scenarios of varying orbital period and misalignment angle,
feeding the disc at a constant rate for 100 orbital periods, and then letting
the disc dissipate for 100 orbital periods. During the disc growth phase, we
find that the binary companion tilts the disc away from its initial plane at
the equator of the primary star before settling to a constant orientation after
40 to 50 orbital periods. While the mass-injection into the disc is ongoing,
the tilting of the disc can cause material to reaccrete onto the primary star
prematurely. Once disc dissipation begins, usually the disc precesses about the
binary companion's orbital axis with precession periods ranging from 20 to 50
orbital periods. In special cases we detect phenomena of disc tearing, as well
as Kozai-Lidov oscillations of the disc. These oscillations reach a maximum
eccentricity of about 0.6, and a minimum inclination of about \ang{20} with
respect to the binary's orbit. We also find the disc material to have highly
eccentric orbits beyond the transition radius, where the disc changes from
being dominated by viscous forces, to heavily controlled by the companion star,
in contrast to its nearly circular motion inward of the transition radius.
Finally, we offer predictions to how these changes will affect Be star
observables.

However, because natural language can contain a great deal of ambiguity and

interactive semantic parsing framework that explains the predicted logical form

through natural-language feedback for individual steps. We focus on question
answering over knowledge bases (KBQA) as an instantiation of our framework,
aiming to increase the transparency of the parsing process and help the user
appropriately trust the final answer. To do so, we construct INSPIRED, a
crowdsourced dialogue dataset derived from the ComplexWebQuestions dataset. Our
experiments show that the interactive framework with human feedback has the
potential to greatly improve overall parse accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a
pipeline for dialogue simulation to evaluate our framework w.r.t. a variety of

The results demonstrate that our interactive semantic parsing framework

the traditional many-body localization phenomenon, SMBL does not require
disorder. Here we investigate SMBL in a spin-$1/2$ described by a Heisenberg
model including a next-nearest-neighbor exchange coupling. By employing an
exact diagonalization approach and time evolution calculation we analyze both
level spacing ratio (LSR) statistics of the Hamiltonian model as well as the
dynamics of the system from a given initial state. Our results reveals that for
zero field in our finite system, LSR statistics suggest localization while the
dynamics shows thermalization, which has been attributed to a finite-size
effect. Slightly nonuniform field gradient, LSR statistic predictions agree
very well with the dynamics of the physical quantities indicating
delocalization and localization for small and large field gradient,
respectively. More interestingly, we find that localization is robust in the
presence of next-nearest-neighbor coupling in the Hamiltonian. Moreover, this
coupling can be tuned to enhance SMBL in the system, meaning that localized
regimes can be obtained for smaller field gradient as compared to the

the complexity has a period of rapid linear growth followed by a saturation
determined by the UV cutoff and the number of spatial dimensions. We also study
the complexity of the unitary evolution of quantum cosmological perturbations
in de Sitter space, which can be written as time-dependent squeezing and
rotation operators on individual Fourier mode pairs. The complexity of a single
mode pair at late times grows linearly with the number of e-folds, while the
complexity at early times oscillates rapidly due to the sensitivity of operator
complexity to the phase of unitary time evolution. Integrating over all modes,
the total complexity of cosmological perturbations scales as the square root of
the (exponentially) growing volume of de Sitter space, suggesting that
inflation leads to an explosive growth in complexity of the Universe.

methodology was applied to two-dimensional incompressible laminar steady flows
around an elastically-mounted circular cylinder, and we obtained the gradients
of the real and imaginary parts of the least stable eigenvalues with respect to
forces located at arbitrary points in the flow domain. Selected values of mass
ratio and reduced velocity were considered in the simulations, and the results
were compared to those obtained for a fixed cylinder at the same Reynolds
number. We noticed that the sensitivity fields of the fluid-structure
interaction system can be very different from its fixed structure counterpart,
and amongst the cases, with an elastic structure, the fields vary greatly
according to the reduced velocity. Finally, the sensitivity results were
verified against linear and nonlinear simulations of flows with small control
cylinders placed at locations selected according to the sensitivity fields. The
agreement between the predictions made with the sensitivity analyses and the
linear and nonlinear results of the forced flows was excellent. In some cases,
it was possible to completely suppress the cylinder vibration.

require the directional derivative of the objective function at a point on the
path. Thus, methods based on a simple backtracking procedure must be used to
give a step that satisfies an ""Armijo-like"" sufficient decrease condition. As a
consequence, conventional projected-search methods are unable to exploit
sophisticated safeguarded polynomial interpolation techniques that have been
shown to be effective for the unconstrained case.
  This paper concerns the formulation and analysis of projected-search methods
based on a new quasi-Wolfe line search that is appropriate for piecewise
differentiable functions. The behavior of the line search is similar to
conventional Wolfe line search, except that a step is accepted under a wider
range of conditions. These conditions take into consideration steps at which
the restriction of the objective function on the search path is not
differentiable. Two new classes of method are proposed that may be broadly
categorized as active-set and interior-point methods. Computational results are
given for two specific methods from these general classes: a projected-search
active-set method that uses a limited-memory quasi-Newton approximation of the
Hessian; and a projected-search primal-dual interior-point method. The results
show that in these contexts, a quasi-Wolfe line search is substantially more
efficient and reliable than an Armijo line search.

Type Ia supernova, shows surprising anomalies in the distribution of its ejecta

several locations far from the remnant center, in some cases beyond prominent
silicon and sulfur emission. These asymmetries strongly suggest a highly
asymmetric explosion. We present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations in
two and three dimensions of the evolution from ages of 100 seconds to hundreds
of years of two asymmetric Type Ia models, expanding into a uniform medium. At
the age of G1.9+0.3 (about 100 years), our 2D model shows almost no iron
shocked to become visible in X-rays. Only in a much higher-density environment
could significant iron be shocked, at which time the model's expansion speed is
completely inconsistent with the observations of G1.9+0.3. Our 3D model,
evolving the most asymmetric of a suite of Type Ia SN models from Seitenzahl et
al.~(2013), shows some features resembling G1.9+0.3. We characterize its
evolution with images of composition in three classes: C and O,
intermediate-mass elements (IMEs), and iron-group elements (IGEs). From ages of
13 to 1800 years, we follow the evolution of the highly asymmetric initial
remnant as the explosion asymmetries decrease in relative strength to be
replaced by asymmetries due to evolutionary hydrodynamic instabilities. At an
age of about 100 years, our 3D model has comparable shocked masses of C+O,
IMEs, and IGEs, with about 0.03 $M_\odot$ each. Evolutionary changes appear to
be rapid enough that continued monitoring with the Chandra X-ray Observatory

simply count the number of index values. First, we place different vectors,
refer to as seed vectors, uniformly throughout the mask image. The mask image
has boundary information of the objects to be counted. Secondly, the seeds are
diffused using an edge-weighted harmonic variational optimization model within

approach and alternating direction minimization method, and theoretical
analysis of this algorithm is given. An optimal solution of the model is
obtained when the distributed seeds are completely diffused such that there is
a unique intensity within each object, which we refer to as an index. For
computational efficiency, we stop the diffusion process before a full
convergence, and propose to cluster these diffused index values. We refer to
this approach as Counting Objects by Diffused Index (CODI). We explore scalar
and multi-dimensional seed vectors. For Scalar seeds, we use Gaussian fitting
in histogram to count, while for vector seeds, we exploit a high-dimensional
clustering method for the final step of counting via clustering. The proposed

in a region far from the interface the main contribution to the radiation comes
from the spherical waves. We present typical radiation patterns for the

radio Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect that goes along with it. The radio
background Comptonization leads to a slight photon excess at all wavelengths,
while Comptonization of the CMB at low frequencies leads to a decrement. For
levels of the radio background consistent with observations, these effects
cancel each other around $\nu\simeq 735~$MHz, with an excess at lower
frequencies and a decrement at higher frequencies. Assuming a purely
cosmological origin of the observed ARCADE radio excess, at $\nu \lesssim
20\,{\rm GHz}$ the signal scales as $\Delta T / T_{\rm CMB}\simeq 2\,y\left[
(\nu/735\,{\rm MHz})^{-2.59}-1\right]$ with frequency and the Compton-$y$
parameter of the cluster. For a typical cluster, the total radio SZ signal is
at the level of $\Delta T\simeq 1\,{\rm mK}$ around the null, with a steep
scaling towards radio frequencies. This is above current raw sensitivity limits
for many radio facilities at these wavelengths, providing a unique way to
confirm the cosmological origin of the ARCADE excess and probe its properties

Gemini ""hedges"" against unpredicted bursts, by spreading these bursts across
multiple paths, to minimize packet loss in exchange for a small increase in

software to accelerate the solving of linear systems in the least squares sense
on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), in double double, quad double, and octo
double precision. The goal is to use accelerators to offset the cost overhead
caused by multiple double precision arithmetic. For the blocked Householder QR
and the back substitution, of interest are those dimensions at which teraflop
performance is attained. The other interesting question is the cost overhead
factor that appears each time the precision is doubled.
  Experimental results are reported on five different NVIDIA GPUs, with a
particular focus on the P100 and the V100, both capable of teraflop
performance. Thanks to the high Compute to Global Memory Access (CGMA) ratios
of multiple double arithmetic, teraflop performance is already attained running
the double double QR on 1,024-by-1,024 matrices, both on the P100 and the V100.
For the back substitution, the dimension of the upper triangular system must be
as high as 17,920 to reach one teraflops on the V100, in quad double precision,
and then taking only the times spent by the kernels into account. The lower
performance of the back substitution in small dimensions does not prevent
teraflop performance of the solver at dimension 1,024, as the time for the QR
decomposition dominates.
  In doubling the precision from double double to quad double and from quad
double to octo double, the observed cost overhead factors are lower than the
factors predicted by the arithmetical operation counts. This observation
correlates with the increased performance for increased precision, which can
again be explained by the high CGMA ratios.

obeying the regulations of data privacy, making it difficult to train a machine
learning model over gathered data from different medical centers. Failure of
leveraging data of the same kind may result in poor generalizability for the
trained model. Federated learning (FL) enables collaboratively training a joint
model while keeping the data decentralized for multiple medical centers.
However, federated optimizations often suffer from the heterogeneity of the
data distribution across medical centers. In this work, we propose Federated
Learning with Shared Label Distribution (FedSLD) for classification tasks, a
method that assumes knowledge of the label distributions for all the
participating clients in the federation. FedSLD adjusts the contribution of
each data sample to the local objective during optimization given knowledge of
the distribution, mitigating the instability brought by data heterogeneity
across all clients. We conduct extensive experiments on four publicly available
image datasets with different types of non-IID data distributions. Our results
show that FedSLD achieves better convergence performance than the compared

synchronization gives rise to a burst in photon emission. This superradiant
burst only occurs if there is one -- or just a few -- dominant decay channels.
For a fixed atom number, this happens only below a critical interatomic
distance. Here we show that array dimensionality is the determinant factor that
drives superradiance. In 2D and 3D arrays, superradiance occurs due to
constructive interference, which grows stronger with atom number. This leads to
a critical distance that scales sublogarithmically with atom number in 2D, and
as a power law in 3D. In 1D arrays, superradiance occurs due to destructive
interference that effectively switches off certain decay channels, yielding a
critical distance that saturates with atom number. Our results provide a guide
to explore many-body decay in state-of-the art experimental setups.

canonical utterances and programs from a grammar, and further paraphrasing
these utterances to improve linguistic diversity. However, such synthetic

zero-shot parsers through the lenses of the language and logical gaps (Herzig

the computation of a leading-edge suction parameter based on measured values of
the partial circulation around the leading-edge and the stagnation point
location. We validate the computation of the leading-edge suction parameter for
both numerical and experimental data under steady and unsteady flow conditions.
The leading-order approximation of the definition of the leading-edge suction
parameter is proven to be sufficiently accurate for the application to thin
aerofoils such as the NACA0009 without a-priori knowledge of the stagnation
point location. The higher-order terms including the stagnation point location
are required to reliably compute the leading-edge suction parameter on thicker
aerofoils such as the NACA0015. The computation of the leading-edge suction
parameter from inviscid flow theory does not assume the Kutta condition to be
valid at the trailing edge which allows us to compute its value for separated
flows. The relation between the leading-edge suction parameter and the
evolution of the shear layer height is studied in two different unsteady flow
conditions, a fixed aerofoil in a fluctuating free-stream velocity and a
pitching aerofoil in a steady free-stream. We demonstrate here that the
instantaneous value of the leading-edge suction parameter based on the partial
circulation around the leading edge is unambiguously defined for a given flow

unsteady flow separation at the leading edge.

of linguistic information through probing, an endeavor which consists of
training a supervised model to predict a linguistic property directly from the

subject to extensive criticism in the literature, and has been observed to lead
to paradoxical and counter-intuitive results. In the theoretical portion of
this paper, we take the position that the goal of probing ought to be measuring

task. We further describe a Bayesian framework that operationalizes this goal
and allows us to quantify the representations' inductive bias. In the empirical

Restricting our attention to vascular FSI, we now reduce this arbitrary

vascular wall. The resulting reduced unified continuum formulation achieves
monolithic FSI coupling in the Eulerian frame through a simple modification of
the fluid boundary integral. While ostensibly similar to the semi-discrete
formulation of the coupled momentum method, its underlying derivation does not
rely on an assumption of a fictitious body force in the elastodynamics
sub-problem and therefore represents a direct simplification of the ALE method.
Uniform temporal discretization is performed via the generalized-$\alpha$
scheme. In contrast to the predominant approach yielding only first-order
accuracy for pressure, we collocate both pressure and velocity at the
intermediate time step to achieve uniform second-order temporal accuracy. In
conjunction with quadratic tetrahedral elements, our methodology offers
higher-order temporal and spatial accuracy for quantities of clinical interest.
Furthermore, without loss of consistency, a segregated predictor
multi-corrector algorithm is developed to preserve the same block structure as
for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the implicit solver's
associated linear system. Block preconditioning of a monolithically coupled FSI
system is therefore made possible for the first time. Compared to alternative
preconditioners, our three-level nested block preconditioner, which improves
representation of the Schur complement, demonstrates robust performance over a
wide range of physical parameters. We present verification against Womersley's

(EoR) experiment is the accuracy of the foreground calibration model. Recent
results have shown that highly accurate models of extended foreground sources,
and including models for sources in both the primary beam and its sidelobes,
are necessary for reducing foreground power. To improve the accuracy of the
source models for the EoR fields observed by the Murchison Widefield Array
(MWA), we conducted the MWA Long Baseline Epoch of Reionisation Survey (LoBES).
This survey consists of multi-frequency observations of the main MWA EoR fields
and their eight neighbouring fields using the MWA Phase II extended array. We
present the results of the first half of this survey centred on the MWA EoR0
observing field (centred at RA(J2000) 0 h, Dec(J2000) -27 deg). This half of
the survey covers an area of 3069 degrees$^2$, with an average rms of 2.1 mJy
beam$^{-1}$. The resulting catalogue contains a total of 80824 sources, with 16
separate spectral measurements between 100 and 230 MHz, and spectral modelling
for 78$\%$ of these sources. Over this region we estimate that the catalogue is
90$\%$ complete at 32 mJy, and 70$\%$ complete at 10.5~mJy. The overall
normalised source counts are found to be in good agreement with previous
low-frequency surveys at similar sensitivities. Testing the performance of the
new source models we measure lower residual rms values for peeled sources,
particularly for extended sources, in a set of MWA Phase I data. The
2-dimensional power spectrum of these data residuals also show improvement on
small angular scales -- consistent with the better angular resolution of the
LoBES catalogue. It is clear that the LoBES sky models improve upon the current
sky model used by the Australian MWA EoR group for the EoR0 field.

state of people and enabling various health-related applications (e.g.,
recommending a change of lifestyle, examining the risk of diseases).
Traditional approaches rely on hospitalization or body-attached instruments,
which are costly and intrusive. Therefore, researchers have been exploring
contact-less vital sign monitoring with radio frequency signals in recent
years. Early studies with continuous wave radars/WiFi devices work on detecting
vital signs of a single individual, but it still remains challenging to
simultaneously monitor vital signs of multiple subjects, especially those who
locate in proximity. In this paper, we design and implement a time-division
multiplexing (TDM) phased-MIMO radar sensing scheme for high-precision vital
sign monitoring of multiple people. Our phased-MIMO radar can steer the mmWave
beam towards different directions with a micro-second delay, which enables
capturing the vital signs of multiple individuals at the same radial distance
to the radar. Furthermore, we develop a TDM-MIMO technique to fully utilize all
transmitting antenna (TX)-receiving antenna (RX) pairs, thereby significantly
boosting the signal-to-noise ratio. Based on the designed TDM phased-MIMO
radar, we develop a system to automatically localize multiple human subjects
and estimate their vital signs. Extensive evaluations show that under
two-subject scenarios, our system can achieve an error of less than 1 beat per
minute (BPM) and 3 BPM for breathing rate (BR) and heartbeat rate (HR)
estimations, respectively, at a subject-to-radar distance of $1.6~m$. The
minimal subject-to-subject angle separation is $40{\deg}$, corresponding to a
close distance of $0.5~m$ between two subjects, which outperforms the
state-of-the-art.

significant impacts on space- and ground-based assets. The majority of strong
storms are associated with the passage of interplanetary coronal mass ejections
(ICMEs) in the near-Earth environment. In many cases, these ICMEs can be traced
back unambiguously to a specific coronal mass ejection (CME) and solar activity
on the frontside of the Sun. Hence, predicting the arrival of ICMEs at Earth
from routine observations of CMEs and solar activity currently makes a major
contribution to the forecasting of geomagnetic storms. However, it is clear
that some ICMEs, which may also cause enhanced geomagnetic activity, cannot be
traced back to an observed CME, or, if the CME is identified, its origin may be
elusive or ambiguous in coronal images. Such CMEs have been termed ""stealth
CMEs."" In this review, we focus on these ""problem"" geomagnetic storms in the
sense that the solar/CME precursors are enigmatic and stealthy. We start by
reviewing evidence for stealth CMEs discussed in past studies. We then identify
several moderate to strong geomagnetic storms (minimum Dst < -50 nT) in solar
cycle 24 for which the related solar sources and/or CMEs are unclear and
apparently stealthy. We discuss the solar and in situ circumstances of these
events and identify several scenarios that may account for their elusive solar
signatures. These range from observational limitations (e.g., a coronagraph
near Earth may not detect an incoming CME if it is diffuse and not wide enough)
to the possibility that there is a class of mass ejections from the Sun that
have only weak or hard-to-observe coronal signatures. In particular, some of
these sources are only clearly revealed by considering the evolution of coronal
structures over longer time intervals than is usually considered. We also
review a variety of numerical modelling approaches...

  To answer this question, we propose Recursive ROAR, a new faithfulness
metric. This works by recursively masking allegedly important tokens and then
retraining the model. The principle is that this should result in worse model
performance compared to masking random tokens. The result is a performance
curve given a masking-ratio. Furthermore, we propose a summarizing metric using
relative area-between-curves (RACU), which allows for easy comparison across
papers, models, and tasks.
  We evaluate 4 different importance measures on 8 different datasets, using

the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Stokes equations. These are reduced or
simplified by forming the limit of strong electrolytes, for which ion densities
are relatively large, together with the limit of thin Debye layers. Debye
layers of opposite polarity form on either side of the drop interface or

  Two formulations of the model are given. One utilizes an integral equation

condition that incorporates the double layer structure into relations between

interface remains an open question. While data-to-text generation has the
potential to serve as a universal interface for data and text, its feasibility
for downstream tasks remains largely unknown. In this work, we bridge this gap
and use the data-to-text method as a means for encoding structured knowledge
for ODQA. Specifically, we propose a verbalizer-retriever-reader framework for
ODQA over data and text where verbalized tables from Wikipedia and graphs from
Wikidata are used as augmented knowledge sources. We show that our Unified Data
and Text QA, UDT-QA, can effectively benefit from the expanded knowledge index,
leading to large gains over text-only baselines. Notably, our approach sets the
single-model state-of-the-art on Natural Questions. Furthermore, our analyses
indicate that verbalized knowledge is preferred for answer reasoning for both
adapted and hot-swap settings.

state-of-the-art models to humans; the bigger the performance gap, the harder

understanding of how difficult each instance in a given distribution is, or
what attributes make the dataset difficult for a given model. To address these
questions, we frame dataset difficulty -- w.r.t. a model $\mathcal{V}$ -- as
the lack of $\mathcal{V}$-$\textit{usable information}$ (Xu et al., 2019),
where a lower value indicates a more difficult dataset for $\mathcal{V}$. We
further introduce $\textit{pointwise $\mathcal{V}$-information}$ (PVI) for
measuring the difficulty of individual instances w.r.t. a given distribution.
While standard evaluation metrics typically only compare different models for
the same dataset, $\mathcal{V}$-$\textit{usable information}$ and PVI also
permit the converse: for a given model $\mathcal{V}$, we can compare different
datasets, as well as different instances/slices of the same dataset.
Furthermore, our framework allows for the interpretability of different input
attributes via transformations of the input, which we use to discover
annotation artefacts in widely-used NLP benchmarks.

While important progress was made by exploiting deep neural networks,
incremental learning remains very challenging. This is particularly the case
when no memory of past data is allowed and catastrophic forgetting has a strong
negative effect. We tackle class-incremental learning without memory by
adapting prediction bias correction, a method which makes predictions of past
and new classes more comparable. It was proposed when a memory is allowed and
cannot be directly used without memory, since samples of past classes are
required. We introduce a two-step learning process which allows the transfer of
bias correction parameters between reference and target datasets. Bias
correction is first optimized offline on reference datasets which have an
associated validation memory. The obtained correction parameters are then
transferred to target datasets, for which no memory is available. The second
contribution is to introduce a finer modeling of bias correction by learning
its parameters per incremental state instead of the usual past vs. new class
modeling. The proposed dataset knowledge transfer is applicable to any
incremental method which works without memory. We test its effectiveness by
applying it to four existing methods. Evaluation with four target datasets and
different configurations shows consistent improvement, with practically no
computational and memory overhead.

component of data curation for model development and testing. Currently, IV
contrast is poorly documented in imaging metadata and necessitates manual
correction and annotation by clinician experts, presenting a major barrier to
imaging analyses and algorithm deployment. We sought to develop and validate a
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning (DL) platform to
identify IV contrast within CT scans. Methods: For model development and
evaluation, we used independent datasets of CT scans of head, neck (HN) and
lung cancer patients, totaling 133,480 axial 2D scan slices from 1,979 CT scans
manually annotated for contrast presence by clinical experts. Five different DL
models were adopted and trained in HN training datasets for slice-level
contrast detection. Model performances were evaluated on a hold-out set and on
an independent validation set from another institution. DL models was then
fine-tuned on chest CT data and externally validated on a separate chest CT
dataset. Results: Initial DICOM metadata tags for IV contrast were missing or
erroneous in 1,496 scans (75.6%). The EfficientNetB4-based model showed the
best overall detection performance. For HN scans, AUC was 0.996 in the internal
validation set (n = 216) and 1.0 in the external validation set (n = 595). The
fine-tuned model on chest CTs yielded an AUC: 1.0 for the internal validation
set (n = 53), and AUC: 0.980 for the external validation set (n = 402).
Conclusion: The DL model could accurately detect IV contrast in both HN and
chest CT scans with near-perfect performance.

ability of LMs to reliably capture knowledge over rare entities is a pressing

primarily modify the LM architecture or introduce auxiliary objectives to
inject useful entity knowledge, we ask to what extent we could match the

metadata, such as entity descriptions and categorical tags, are appended to
examples based on information theoretic metrics. Intuitively, if metadata
corresponding to popular entities overlap with metadata for rare entities, the
LM may be able to better reason about the rare entities using patterns learned
from similar popular entities. On standard entity-rich tasks (TACRED, FewRel,

particles in the strong FRB pulse may occur in the outer regions of the
magnetosphere for longer rotation periods, $P\geq 1$ second. These losses are
suppressed by several effects: (i) the ponderomotive pre-acceleration of
background plasma along the direction of wave propagation (losses reduced
approximately as $\gamma_\parallel^{3}$: smaller frequency, $ \propto
\gamma_\parallel^2$ in power, and times scales stretched, $ \propto

used in practice with function approximation (Mnih et al., 2015). In contrast,
existing theoretical results are pessimistic about Q-learning. For example,
(Baird, 1995) shows that Q-learning does not converge even with linear function
approximation for linear MDPs. Furthermore, even for tabular MDPs with
synchronous updates, Q-learning was shown to have sub-optimal sample complexity
(Li et al., 2021;Azar et al., 2013). The goal of this work is to bridge the gap
between practical success of Q-learning and the relatively pessimistic
theoretical results. The starting point of our work is the observation that in
practice, Q-learning is used with two important modifications: (i) training
with two networks, called online network and target network simultaneously
(online target learning, or OTL) , and (ii) experience replay (ER) (Mnih et
al., 2015). While they have been observed to play a significant role in the
practical success of Q-learning, a thorough theoretical understanding of how
these two modifications improve the convergence behavior of Q-learning has been
missing in literature. By carefully combining Q-learning with OTL and reverse
experience replay (RER) (a form of experience replay), we present novel methods
Q-Rex and Q-RexDaRe (Q-Rex + data reuse). We show that Q-Rex efficiently finds
the optimal policy for linear MDPs (or more generally for MDPs with zero
inherent Bellman error with linear approximation (ZIBEL)) and provide
non-asymptotic bounds on sample complexity -- the first such result for a
Q-learning method for this class of MDPs under standard assumptions.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that Q-RexDaRe in fact achieves near optimal sample
complexity in the tabular setting, improving upon the existing results for
vanilla Q-learning.

worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) maximization over
distributional uncertainty sets for the random interference-plus-noise
covariance (INC) matrix and desired signal steering vector. The distributional
uncertainty set of the INC matrix accounts for the support and the positive
semidefinite (PSD) mean of the distribution, and a similarity constraint on the
mean. The distributional uncertainty set for the steering vector consists of
the constraints on the known first- and second-order moments. The RAB problem
is formulated as a minimization of the worst-case expected value of the SINR
denominator achieved by any distribution, subject to the expected value of the
numerator being greater than or equal to one for each distribution. Resorting
to the strong duality of linear conic programming, such a RAB problem is
rewritten as a quadratic matrix inequality problem. It is then tackled by
iteratively solving a sequence of linear matrix inequality relaxation problems
with the penalty term on the rank-one PSD matrix constraint. To validate the
results, simulation examples are presented, and they demonstrate the improved
performance of the proposed robust beamformer in terms of the array output
SINR.

of BD is the derivation of Benders cuts, which are often not unique. In this
paper, we introduce a novel unifying Benders cut selection technique based on a
geometric interpretation of cut ``depth'', produce deepest Benders cuts based
on $\ell_p$-norms, and study their properties. Specifically, we show that
deepest cuts resolve infeasibility through minimal deviation from the incumbent
point, are relatively sparse, and may produce optimality cuts even when
classical Benders would require a feasibility cut. Leveraging the duality
between separation and projection, we develop a Guided Projections Algorithm
for producing deepest cuts while exploiting the combinatorial structure or
decomposablity of problem instances. We then propose a generalization of our
Benders separation problem that brings several well-known cut selection
strategies under one umbrella. In particular, we provide systematic ways of
selecting the normalization coefficients in the Minimal Infeasible Subsystems
method by establishing its connection to our method. Finally, in our tests on
facility location problems, we show deepest cuts often reduce both runtime and
number of Benders iterations, as compared to other cut selection strategies;
and relative to classical Benders, use $1/3$ the number of cuts and $1/2$ the
runtime.

methods with differing assumptions on the attacker's strength and prior
information. Our goal is to understand adversarial attacks on GP bandits from
theoretical and practical perspectives. We focus primarily on targeted attacks
on the popular GP-UCB algorithm and a related elimination-based algorithm,
based on adversarially perturbing the function $f$ to produce another function
$\tilde{f}$ whose optima are in some target region $\mathcal{R}_{\rm target}$.
Based on our theoretical analysis, we devise both white-box attacks (known $f$)
and black-box attacks (unknown $f$), with the former including a Subtraction
attack and Clipping attack, and the latter including an Aggressive subtraction
attack. We demonstrate that adversarial attacks on GP bandits can succeed in
forcing the algorithm towards $\mathcal{R}_{\rm target}$ even with a low attack
budget, and we test our attacks' effectiveness on a diverse range of objective
functions.

qubit, and the $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^+$ isotope is promising as a high-fidelity
qudit ($d>2$). Barium metal is very reactive, and $^{133}\mathrm{Ba}^+$ is
radioactive and can only be sourced in small quantities, so the most commonly
used loading method, oven heating, is less suited for barium, and is currently
not possible for $^{133}\mathrm{Ba}^+$.Pulsed laser ablation solves both of
these problems by utilizing compound barium sources, while also giving some
distinct advantages, such as fast loading, less displaced material, and lower
heat load near the ion trap. Because of the relatively low abundances of the
isotopes of interest, a two-step photoionization technique is used, which gives
us the ability to selectively load isotopes. Characterization of the ablation
process for our $\mathrm{BaCl}_2$ targets are presented, including observation
of neutral and ion ablation-fluence regimes, preparation/conditioning and
lifetimes of ablation spots, and plume velocity distributions.We show that
using laser ablation on $\mathrm{BaCl}_2$ salt targets with a two-step
photoionization method, we can produce and trap barium ions reliably. Further,
we demonstrate that with our photoionization method, we can trap
$^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^+$ with an enhanced selectivity compared to its natural
abundance.

Retrieval (CASPER). Given an input query, the parser retrieves related
exemplars from a retrieval index, augments them to the query, and then applies
a generative seq2seq model to produce an output parse. The exemplars act as a

retrieval index or how the augmented query is constructed, we can manipulate
the behavior of the parser. On the MTOP dataset, in addition to achieving

results show the superiority of the proposed model over other existing methods

heterogeneous graph-based model attaches more importance to hemispheric

that unlike classic models of rubber elasticity they do not consider the
coupled electromechanical response of single polymer chains which must be
treated using statistical mechanics. The objective of this paper is to compute
the stretch and polarization of single polymer chains subject to a fixed force
and fixed electric field using statistical mechanics. We assume that the
dipoles induced by the applied electric field at each link do not interact with
each other and compute the partition function using standard techniques. We
then calculate the stretch and polarization by taking appropriate derivatives
of the partition function and obtain analytical results in various limits. We
also perform Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis and
umbrella sampling methods, as well as develop a new sampling method which
improves convergence by exploiting a symmetry inherent in dielectric polymer
chains. The analytical expressions are shown to agree with the Monte Carlo
results over a range of forces and electric fields. Our results complement

coarse graphs can be propagated over longer distances compared to dense graphs.
In addition, information about pose can guide to recover local shape detail and
vice versa. We recognize that the connection between coarse and dense is itself

different decays for different kinds of $k>0~$. Finally, we show that the

galaxies (MBHBM$^\star$) Project, we present a dynamical measurement of the
supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the nearby lenticular galaxy NGC 3593,
using cold molecular gas $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission observed at an angular
resolution of $\approx0''.3$ ($\approx10$ pc) with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Our ALMA observations reveal a
circumnuclear molecular gas disc (CND) elongated along the galaxy major axis
and rotating around the SMBH. Using dynamical modelling, the molecular gas
kinematics allow us to infer a SMBH mass $M_{\rm
BH}=2.40_{-1.05}^{+1.87}\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ (only statistical uncertainties
at the $3\sigma$ level). We also detect a massive core of cold molecular gas
(CMC) of mass $M_{\rm CMC}=(5.4\pm1.2)\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ and effective
(half-mass) radius $r_{\rm CMC,e}=11.2\pm2.8$ pc, co-spatial with a nuclear
star cluster (NSC) of mass $M_{\rm NSC}=(1.67\pm0.48)\times10^7$ M$_\odot$ and
effective radius $r_{\rm NSC,e}=5.0\pm1.0$~pc (or $0''.15\pm0''.03$). The mass
profiles of the CMC and NSC are well described by S\'{e}rsic functions with
indices $1-1.4$. Our $M_{\rm BH}$ and $M_{\rm NSC}$ estimates for NGC 3593
agree well with the recently compiled $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm NSC}$ scaling
relation. Although the $M_{\rm NSC}$ uncertainty is twice the inferred $M_{\rm
BH}$, the rapid central rise of the rotation velocities of the CND (as the
radius decreases) clearly suggests a SMBH. Indeed, our dynamical models show
that even if $M_{\rm NSC}$ is at the upper end of its allowed range, the
evidence for a black hole does not vanish, but remains with a lower limit of
$M_{\rm BH}>3\times10^5$ M$_\odot$.

onset and the related instability of the magneotail current sheet. Since the
simplest 2D current sheet configuration with monotonic $B_z$ was proven to be
stable to the tearing mode, the focus of the instability investigation moved to
more specific configurations, e.g. kinetic current sheets with strong transient
ion currents and current sheets with non-monotonic $B_z$ (local $B_z$ minima
or/and peaks). Stability of the latter current sheet configuration has been
studied both within kinetic and fluid approaches, whereas the investigation of
the transient ion effects were limited to kinetic models only. This paper aims
to provide detailed analysis of stability of a multi-fluid current sheet
configuration that mimics current sheets with transient ions. Using the system
with two field-aligned ion flows that mimic the effect of pressure
non-gyrotropy, we construct 1D current sheet with a finite $B_z$. This model
describes well recent findings of very thin intense magnetotail current sheets.
The stability analysis of this two-ion model confirms the stabilizing effect of
finite $B_z$ and shows that the most stable current sheet is the one with
exactly counter-streaming ion flows and zero net flow. Such field-aligned flows
may substitute the contribution of the pressure tensor nongyrotropy to the
stress balance, but cannot overtake the stabilizing effect of $B_z$. Obtained
results are discussed in the context of magnetotail dynamical models and
spacecraft observations.

make it difficult for these algorithms to provide both efficiency and

However, they are not capable of adapting to dynamically changing environments

Specifically, SiCLOP tailors Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and uses

provides real time solution of a MMDP problem. It also improves scalability

operate in different environments. We also provide theoretical discussion about
the convergence property of our algorithm within the context of multi-agent

to its potential to improve grid resilience by realizing self-healing
microgrids (MGs). This paper proposes a new strategy for the real-time
frequency regulation of a reconfigurable MG, wherein the feedforward control of
synchronous and inverter-interfaced distributed generators (DGs) is achieved in
coordination with the operations of sectionalizing and tie switches (SWs). This
enables DGs to compensate more quickly, and preemptively, for a forthcoming
variation in load demand due to NR-aided restoration. An analytical dynamic
model of a reconfigurable MG is developed to analyze the MG frequency response
to NR and hence determine the desired dynamics of the feedforward controllers,
with the integration of feedback loops for inertial response emulation and
primary and secondary frequency control. A small-signal analysis is conducted
to analyze the contribution of the supplementary feedforward control to the MG
frequency regulation. Simulation case studies of NR-aided load restoration are
also performed. The results of the small-signal analysis and case studies
confirm that the proposed strategy is effective for improving the MG frequency
regulation under various conditions of load demand, model parameter errors, and
communication time delays.

the level of psycho-physiological arousal from a) human annotations fused with
b) galvanic skin response (also known as Electrodermal Activity (EDA)) signals
from the stressed people. The Ulm-TSST dataset which is a novel subset of the
audio-visual textual Ulm-Trier Social Stress dataset that features German

in both sub-challenges. For the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge, we highlight our
solutions in three aspects: 1) the audio-visual features and the bio-signal
features are used for emotional state recognition. 2) the Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) with the self-attention mechanism is utilized to capture complex
temporal dependencies within the feature sequences. 3) the late fusion strategy
is adopted to further boost the model's recognition performance by exploiting
complementary information scattered across multimodal sequences. Our proposed
model achieves CCC of 0.6159 and 0.4609 for valence and arousal respectively on
the test set, which both rank in the top 3. For the MuSe-Physio sub-challenge,
we first extract the audio-visual features and the bio-signal features from
multiple modalities. Then, the LSTM module with the self-attention mechanism,
and the Gated Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) as well as the LSTM network
are utilized for modeling the complex temporal dependencies in the sequence.
Finally, the late fusion strategy is used. Our proposed method also achieves
CCC of 0.5412 on the test set, which ranks in the top 3.

incorporating both the semantic encoding and the semantic communication

how the semantics are processed and represented in a semantics-aware coding and

$S_8$ constrained by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and the smaller
one suggested by the cosmic shear data. Recent studies show that, for
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, redshift-space distortion (RSD) data also prefers a
smaller $S_8$ that is $\sim 2$-$3\sigma$ lower than the CMB value, but the
result is sensitive to the cosmological model. In the present work we update
the RSD constraint on $S_8$ with the most up-to-date RSD data set where the
correlation between data points are properly taken into account. To reduce the
model dependence, we add in our Monte Carlo Markov Chain calculation the most
up-to-date data sets of Type Ia supernovae (SN) and baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO), whose correlation with RSD is also taken into account, to
constrain the background geometry. For $\Lambda$CDM cosmology we find $S_8=
0.812 \pm 0.026$, which is $\sim 2\sigma$ larger than previous studies, and
hence is consistent with the CMB constraint. By replacing $\Lambda$CDM with the
Parameterization based on cosmic Age (PAge), an almost model-independent
description of the late universe, we find that the RSD + SN + BAO constraint on
$S_8$ is insensitive to the cosmological model.

$\theta_0$, it is rigorously proved that Lasso \textit{without

critical one is that an eavesdropper (Eve) cannot distinguish between the
signal and decoy states. However, a rigorous proof of the rationality about
this assumption is not yet available so far. In fact, due to the difference of
photon-number probability distribution between the signal and decoy states, Eve
is able to distinguish the two states with a certain probability. In this work,
we adopt the Bayesian decision to distinguish the signal and decoy states in
one-decoy-state QKD, and perform different PNS attack strategies for the two
states according to the previous decision. The numerical simulations indicate
that the attack effect is not obvious or even failed. Thus, it is reasonable to
assume that the signal and decoy states are indistinguishable in decoy-state

improve the communication efficiency, but also avoid the attack from Eve using

constant magnetic field magnitude $|{\bf B}|$, i.e., approximate magnetic
pressure balance. Such domains are interrupted by particularly strong
fluctuations, including but not limited to radial field (polarity) reversals,
known as switchbacks. It has been proposed that nonlinear Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities form near magnetic boundaries in the nascent solar wind leading
to extensive shear-driven dynamics, strong turbulent fluctuations including
switchbacks, and mixing layers that involve domains of approximate magnetic

fraction of domains, a measure of Alfv\'enicity, varies from median values of
90% within 0.2 au to 38% outside 0.9 au, with strong fluctuations. We find an
inverse association between the mean domain duration and plasma $\beta$. We
examine whether the mean domain duration is also related to the crossing time

ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) system. The considered
scenario is a finite blocklength (FBL) regime and the problem is solved by
leveraging a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm named
twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3). First, assuming an
industrial automation system with multiple actuators, the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and achievable rate in the FBL regime
are identified for each actuator in terms of the phase shift configuration
matrix at the RIS. Next, the joint active/passive beamforming and CBL
optimization problem is formulated where the objective is to maximize the total
achievable FBL rate in all actuators, subject to non-linear amplitude response
at the RIS elements, BS transmit power budget, and total available CBL. Since
the amplitude response equality constraint is highly non-convex and non-linear,
we resort to employing an actor-critic policy gradient DRL algorithm based on
TD3. The considered method relies on interacting RIS with the industrial
automation environment by taking actions which are the phase shifts at the RIS
elements, CBL variables, and BS beamforming to maximize the expected observed
reward, i.e., the total FBL rate. We assess the performance loss of the system
when the RIS is non-ideal, i.e., with non-linear amplitude response, and
compare it with ideal RIS without impairments. The numerical results show that
optimizing the RIS phase shifts, BS beamforming, and CBL variables via the
proposed TD3 method is highly beneficial to improving the network total FBL
rate as the proposed method with deterministic policy outperforms conventional
methods.

datasets should include diverse examples that span numerous phenomena. Dynamic
adversarial data collection (DADC), where annotators craft examples that
challenge continually improving models, holds promise as an approach for
generating such diverse training sets. Prior work has shown that running DADC
over 1-3 rounds can help models fix some error types, but it does not
necessarily lead to better generalization beyond adversarial test data. We
argue that running DADC over many rounds maximizes its training-time benefits,
as the different rounds can together cover many of the task-relevant phenomena.
We present the first study of longer-term DADC, where we collect 20 rounds of
NLI examples for a small set of premise paragraphs, with both adversarial and
non-adversarial approaches. Models trained on DADC examples make 26% fewer
errors on our expert-curated test set compared to models trained on
non-adversarial data. Our analysis shows that DADC yields examples that are
more difficult, more lexically and syntactically diverse, and contain fewer
annotation artifacts compared to non-adversarial examples.

consider multimodal dialogue generation under a natural assumption that only

devise a novel conversational agent, Divter, in order to isolate parameters

means, the major part of the model can be learned from a large number of
text-only dialogues and text-image pairs respectively, then the whole

and can lead to structural damage. Accurate prediction and modelling of the
dynamic stall loads are crucial for a more robust design of wings and blades
that operate under unsteady conditions susceptible to dynamic stall and for
widening the range of operation of these lifting surfaces. Many dynamic stall
models rely on empirical parameters that need to be obtained from experimental
or numerical data which limits their generalisability. Here, we introduce
physically derived times scales to replace the empirical parameters in the
Goman-Khrabrov dynamic stall model. The physics-based time constants correspond
to the dynamic stall delay and the decay rate of post-stall load fluctuations.
The dynamic stall delay is largely independent of the type of the motion, the
Reynolds number, and the airfoil geometry and is described as a function of a
normalised instantaneous pitch rate. The post-stall decay rate is independent
of the motion kinematics and is directly related to the Strouhal number of the
post-stall vortex shedding. The general validity of our physics-based time
constants is demonstrated using three sets of experimental dynamic stall data
covering various airfoil profiles, Reynolds numbers varying from 75'000 to
1'000'000, and sinusoidal and ramp-up pitching motions. The use of
physics-based time constants generalises the Goman-Khrabrov dynamic stall model

kinetic energy (bulk flow+thermal energy) at the rate per unit volume of ${\pp

Such decaying turbulence is well known to evolve toward a state with strongly
intermittent plasma current. Here we decompose the electric field into
components that are irrotational, ${\pp E}_{\rm ir}$, and solenoidal
(divergence-free), ${\pp E}_{\rm so}$. ${\pp E}_{\rm ir}$ is associated with
charge separation, and ${\pp J}\cdot{\pp E}_{\rm ir}$ is a rate of energy
transfer between ions and electrons with little net change in plasma kinetic

accompanied by a sharp change in properties, even a small shift of such a
critical temperature can lead to large changes in properties in its vicinity.
In order to account for this effect, data known from various sources on the
true coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE) of w\""ustite , magnetite ,
hematite , and metallic iron are generalized by approximating functions that
include critical temperatures as variable parameters. It is shown that the true
CLTE of magnetite at the same rated temperature can differ by up to 30%
depending on the position of the Curie point within the limits of its possible
""movability"". The proposed methods allow to take into account the critical
temperatures as adaptation parameters in engineering calculations of thermal
expansion of oxide scale. Generalized formulas for each scale component are
also given in a particular form for fixed (basic) values of critical

trajectory $\hat x(.)$ whose distance from the reference trajectory $x(.)$ is
bounded by a quantity proportional to $\sqrt{d}$. Our method requires a further
assumption of non-positiveness of a sort of curvature and is based on the

establish the continuity up to the boundary of the value function $V$ of a

attracts more attention as a prominent tool for neural model compression.
However, there are counter intuitive observations in the literature showing
some challenging limitations of KD. A case in point is that the best performing
checkpoint of the teacher might not necessarily be the best teacher for
training the student in KD. Therefore, one important question would be how to
find the best checkpoint of the teacher for distillation? Searching through the
checkpoints of the teacher would be a very tedious and computationally
expensive process, which we refer to as the \textit{checkpoint-search problem}.
Moreover, another observation is that larger teachers might not necessarily be
better teachers in KD which is referred to as the \textit{capacity-gap}
problem. To address these challenging problems, in this work, we introduce our
progressive knowledge distillation (Pro-KD) technique which defines a smoother
training path for the student by following the training footprints of the
teacher instead of solely relying on distilling from a single mature
fully-trained teacher. We demonstrate that our technique is quite effective in
mitigating the capacity-gap problem and the checkpoint search problem. We
evaluate our technique using a comprehensive set of experiments on different
tasks such as image classification (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), natural language
understanding tasks of the GLUE benchmark, and question answering (SQuAD 1.1
and 2.0) using BERT-based models and consistently got superior results over
state-of-the-art techniques.

PTLM's ability to adapt to new corpora while retaining learned knowledge in
earlier corpora. Our experiments show distillation-based approaches to be most

successfully and yields state-of-the-art results. However, its performance is
still affected by speaker mismatch between training and test data. Further
finetuning a trained model with target speaker data is the most natural
approach for adaptation, but it takes a lot of compute and may cause
catastrophic forgetting to the existing speakers. In this work, we propose a
unified speaker adaptation approach consisting of feature adaptation and model
adaptation. For feature adaptation, we employ a speaker-aware persistent memory
model which generalizes better to unseen test speakers by making use of speaker
i-vectors to form a persistent memory. For model adaptation, we use a novel
gradual pruning method to adapt to target speakers without changing the model
architecture, which to the best of our knowledge, has never been explored in
ASR. Specifically, we gradually prune less contributing parameters on model
encoder to a certain sparsity level, and use the pruned parameters for
adaptation, while freezing the unpruned parameters to keep the original model
performance. We conduct experiments on the Librispeech dataset. Our proposed
approach brings relative 2.74-6.52% word error rate (WER) reduction on general
speaker adaptation. On target speaker adaptation, our method outperforms the
baseline with up to 20.58% relative WER reduction, and surpasses the finetuning
method by up to relative 2.54%. Besides, with extremely low-resource adaptation

the conifold and the non-critical string on the semi-infinite cigar described
by SL($2, \mathbb{R}$)/U(1) Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model. This spectrum was

operators on the cigar. We show that in most channels holographic approach
works in our theory because normalizable and non-normalizable vertex operators
with the same conformal dimension are related due to the reflection from the

hole concentrations in the overdoped region is found. To elucidate the reasons
for such unusual behavior the electronic structure of the low-energy
excitations and the structure of the contributions of the pair states to the
superconducting gap in momentum space were investigated at different doping. It
is shown that the presence of a shallow pocket in the region of the maximum
value of the s*-wave component of the gap results in different symmetry of the
superconducting gap in different regions of the k-space and an increase in the
s*-wave component.

that completely coincides with the BH of the Einstein general relativity
despite the non-vanishing value of the {\bf mimetic-like scalar field}. The
first case is completely consistent with the previous studies in the literature
that mimetic theory coincides with GR \cite{Nashed:2018qag}. In the second
case, we derive a solution with a constant value of the {\bf potential} and a
dynamical value of the Lagrange multiplier. This solution has no horizon and
therefore the obtained spacetime does not correspond to the BH. In this
solution, there appears the region of the Euclidian signature where the
signature of the diagonal components of the metric is $(+,+,+,+)$ or the region
with two times where the signature is $(+,+,-,-)$. Finally, we derive a BH
solution with non-vanishing values of the Lagrange multiplier, {\bf potential},

with the Einstein BH solution. The relevant physics of the third case is
discussed by showing their behavior of the metric potential at infinity,
calculating their energy conditions, and study their thermodynamical

with fine-grained rims (FGRs). FGRs can be formed on the surface of free
floating chondrules in a turbulent nebula, where dust aggregation also occurs.
A former study has reported that the morphology of the dust populations
accreting onto chondrules affects the initial structures of FGRs. It was
revealed that, if monomer grains accrete onto chondrules, the smaller grains
tend to accumulate near the surface of chondrules, and FGRs exhibit grain size
coarsening from the bottom to the top. However, the study did not consider the
effect of temporal growth of dust aggregates on FGRs formation. In this study,
we calculate the aggregation of polydisperse monomer grains and their accretion
onto chondrules. The following two different stages of dust aggregation can be
identified: the monomer-aggregation stage and the BCCA-like stage. In the
monomer-aggregation stage, monomer grains are incorporated into aggregates when
the average aggregate size reaches the size of the monomer. In the BCCA-like
stage, aggregates evolve fractally in a fashion similar to that of single size
monomer grains. Based on the results of the previous study, we obtain the
requisite conditions for chondrules to acquire monomer-accreting FGRs with
grain size coarsening observed in some chondrites. In the case of similar size
distribution as that of Inter Stellar Medium (ISM), the maximum grain size of
$>$ $1$ $\mu$m is widely ($\alpha$ $<$ $10^{-3}$) required for monomer
accretion, while if turbulent intensity in a nebula is extremely weak ($\alpha$
$<$ $10^{-5}$), a maximum grain size $\sim$ $10$ $\mu$m is required. The
monomer size distributions having larger mass fraction in the large grains
compared to ISM might be necessary for the effective grain size coarsening.

images and name it deep debanding network (deepDeband). For its training, we
construct a large-scale dataset of 51,490 pairs of corresponding pristine and
banded image patches. Performance evaluation shows that deepDeband is
successful at greatly reducing banding artifacts in images, outperforming
existing methods both quantitatively and visually.

  Framework for Embodied Navigation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  An embodied task such as embodied question answering (EmbodiedQA), requires
an agent to explore the environment and collect clues to answer a given
question that related with specific objects in the scene. The solution of such
task usually includes two stages, a navigator and a visual Q&A module. In this
paper, we focus on the navigation and solve the problem of existing navigation
algorithms lacking experience and common sense, which essentially results in a
failure finding target when robot is spawn in unknown environments.
  Inspired by the human ability to think twice before moving and conceive
several feasible paths to seek a goal in unfamiliar scenes, we present a route
planning method named Path Estimation and Memory Recalling (PEMR) framework.
PEMR includes a ""looking ahead"" process, \textit{i.e.} a visual feature
extractor module that estimates feasible paths for gathering 3D navigational
information, which is mimicking the human sense of direction. PEMR contains
another process ``looking behind'' process that is a memory recall mechanism
aims at fully leveraging past experience collected by the feature extractor.
Last but not the least, to encourage the navigator to learn more accurate prior
expert experience, we improve the original benchmark dataset and provide a
family of evaluation metrics for diagnosing both navigation and question
answering modules. We show strong experimental results of PEMR on the
EmbodiedQA navigation task.

simple quantitative laws have emerged that connect cell growth to proteomic

the previous ground-truth tokens. The semantic information in the previously
generated tokens is lost. Therefore, we design a self-forcing (SF) stream that
takes the semantic information in the probability distribution of the previous

self-driving car ALVINN in 1989, with a supervised learning approach, or
behavioral cloning (BC). In BC, a neural network is trained with state-action
pairs that constitute the training set made by an expert, i.e., a human driver.
However, this type of imitation learning does not take into account the
temporal dependencies that might exist between actions taken in different
moments of a navigation trajectory. These type of tasks are better handled by
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, which need to define a reward function.
On the other hand, more recent approaches to imitation learning, such as
Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), can train policies without
explicitly requiring to define a reward function, allowing an agent to learn by
trial and error directly on a training set of expert trajectories. In this
work, we propose two variations of GAIL for autonomous navigation of a vehicle
in the realistic CARLA simulation environment for urban scenarios. Both of them
use the same network architecture, which process high dimensional image input
from three frontal cameras, and other nine continuous inputs representing the
velocity, the next point from the sparse trajectory and a high-level driving

algorithms on satellite imagery is a rising topic of research. Although
satellite imagery quality is relatively low, additional spectral channels
provide a sufficient amount of information for tree crown classification tasks.

crowns generated by Autoencoders as a data set to train classical Machine

common method among topic modeling methods. In this article, the proposed
n-stage LDA method, which can enable the LDA method to be used more
effectively, is explained in detail. The positive effect of the method has been
demonstrated by the applied English and Turkish studies. Since the method

is the consensus problem. It was shown to abstract a myriad of problems in
which processes have to agree on a single value. Consensus applications include
fundamental services for the environments of the Cloud or Blockchain. In such
challenging environments, malicious behavior is often modeled as adversarial
Byzantine faults. At OPODIS 2010, Moste}faoui and Raynal, in short, MR,
presented a Byzantine- and intrusion-tolerant solution to consensus in which
the decided value cannot be a value proposed only by Byzantine processes. In
addition to this validity property, MR has optimal resilience since it can deal
with up to t < n/3 Byzantine processes, where n is the number of processes. We
note that MR provides this multivalued consensus object (which accepts
proposals taken from a set with a finite number of values) assuming the
availability of a single Binary consensus object (which accepts proposals taken
from the set {0,1}).
  This work, which focuses on multivalued consensus, aims at the design of an
even more robust solution than MR. Our proposal expands MR's fault-model with
self-stabilization, a vigorous notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to
tolerating Byzantine and communication failures, self-stabilizing systems can
automatically recover after the occurrence of arbitrary transient-faults. These
faults represent any violation of the assumptions according to which the system
was designed to operate (provided that the algorithm code remains intact).
  To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first self-stabilizing solution
for intrusion-tolerant multivalued consensus for asynchronous message-passing
systems prone to Byzantine failures.

$\alpha$ and $\beta$, and compare the results with the linear split. We find
that the beta functions for the Higgs potential are expressed in terms of
redefined Planck mass such that the apparent gauge dependence is absent. Only
the trace mode of the gravity fluctuations couples to the Higgs potential and
it tends to decouple in the large $\beta$ limit, but the anomalous dimension
becomes large, invalidating the local potential approximation. This gives the
limitation of the exponential parametrization. There are also singularities for
some values of the gauge parameters but well away from these, we find rather
stable fixed points and critical exponents. We thus find that there are regions
for the gauge parameters to give stable fixed points and critical exponents
against the change of gauge parameters. The Higgs coupling is confirmed to be
irrelevant for the reasonable choice of gauge parameters.

  mapping, IQHE and FQHE labelling","10 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The magnetic field affects the Bloch band structure in a couple of ways.
First it breaks the Bloch band into magnetic subbands or the Landau levels are
broadened into magnetic Bloch bands. The resulting group of subbands in the
central portion of the energy scale is associated with the integer quantum Hall
effect (IQHE). Then at high fields it changes the integrated density of states
of the remaining lowest and topmost subband, respectively, which can be
associated with fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE).
  Here, we employ the Maxwell Chern-Simons gauge theory to formulate the
subband-gap mapping algorithm and to construct the butterfly profile of the
Hofstadter spectrum. The two regions in the spectrum responsible for the IQHE
are identified. At very high magnetic fields the highest and lowest subband are
affected by magnetic-field induced restructuring of the integrated density of
states in each subband, respectively. The resulting transformation of each of
the two subband is responsible for the FQHE. Thus, in the central regions of
the energy scale, the principal group of subbands defined by the gap mapping is
responsible for the IQHE. The fine structure of the topmost and lowest subband,
which convey an iterative nature of the magnetic spectrum is a result of a
hierarchical scaling and restructuring by the magnetic fields on the integrated
density of states in each respective subband and is responsible for the FQHE.

15.9+/-1.6 ME with nearly equal probability; the two solutions correspond to
two possibilities for the stellar activity period. Hence, the density is either
5.1+/-0.7 g cm^-3 or 5.5^{+0.8}_{-0.7} g cm^-3, making it one of the relatively

demonstrated which attempts to estimate the unknown utopia in formulating
acquisition function, through calibration using a priori selected regression
model. However, the existing MOBO model lacks flexibility in selecting the
appropriate regression models given the guided sampled data and therefore, can
under-fit or over-fit as the iterations of the MOBO progress, reducing the
overall MOBO performance. As it is too complex to a priori guarantee a best
model in general, this motivates us to consider a portfolio of different
families of predictive models fitted with current training data, guided by the
WTB MOBO; the best model is selected following a user-defined prediction root
mean-square-error-based approach. The proposed approach is implemented in
optimizing a multi-modal benchmark problem and a thin tube design under
constant loading of temperature-pressure, with minimizing the risk of
creep-fatigue failure and design cost. Finally, the nested weighted Tchebycheff
MOBO model performance is compared with different MOBO frameworks with respect
to accuracy in parameter estimation, Pareto-optimal solutions and function
evaluation cost. This method is generalized enough to consider different
families of predictive models in the portfolio for best model selection, where
the overall design architecture allows for solving any high-dimensional
(multiple functions) complex black-box problems and can be extended to any
other global criterion multi-objective optimization methods where prior

unequivocally shown fast-cooling sources, such as in the case of neutron star
MXB 1659-29. Previous calculations have estimated its total neutrino luminosity
and heat capacity, as well as suggested that direct Urca reactions take place
in $1 \%$ of the volume of the core. In this paper, we reproduce the inferred
luminosity of this source with detailed models of equations of state (EOS) and
nuclear pairing gaps. We show that three superfluidity gap models are
inconsistent with data for all EOS and another three are disfavoured because of
fine tuning arguments. We also calculate the total heat capacity for all
constructed stars and show that independent observations of mass and luminosity
could set constraints on the core superfluidity of a source as well as the
density slope of the symmetry energy, L. This is an important step towards
defining a universal equation of state for neutron stars and therefore, towards
a better understanding of the phase diagram of asymmetric matter at high
densities.

machine learning algorithms to production. Engineering data pipelines for
video-sequences poses several challenges including isolation of key-frames from
video sequences that are high quality and represent significant variations in
the scene. Manual isolation of such quality key-frames can take hours of
sifting through hours worth of video data. In this work, we present a data
pipeline framework that can automate this process of manual frame sifting in
video sequences by controlling the fraction of frames that can be removed based
on image quality and content type. Additionally, the frames that are retained
can be automatically tagged per sequence, thereby simplifying the process of
automated data retrieval for future ML model deployments. We analyze the
performance of the proposed video-data pipeline for versioned deployment and
monitoring for object detection algorithms that are trained on outdoor
autonomous driving video sequences. The proposed video-data pipeline can retain
anywhere between 0.1-20% of the all input frames that are representative of
high image quality and high variations in content. This frame selection,
automated scene tagging followed by model verification can be completed in
under 30 seconds for 22 video-sequences under analysis in this work. Thus, the
proposed framework can be scaled to additional video-sequence data sets for
automating ML versioned deployments.

underlying physics of dynamical systems from measured data. Existing
approaches, however, still lack robustness, especially when the measured data
contain a large level of noise. The lack of robustness is mainly attributed to
the insufficient representativeness of used features. As a result, the
intrinsic mechanism governing the observed system cannot be accurately
identified. In this study, we use an efficient topological descriptor for
complex data, i.e., the Euler characteristics (ECs), as features to
characterize the spatiotemporal data collected from dynamical systems and
discover the underlying physics. Unsupervised manifold learning and supervised
classification results show that EC can be used to efficiently distinguish
systems with different while similar governing models. We also demonstrate that
the machine learning approaches using EC can improve the confidence level of
sparse regression methods of physics discovery.

  Fundamental Newtonian Approach","21 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A novel method for calculating power output from wind turbines using
Newtonian mechanics is proposed. This contrasts with current methods based on
interception rates by airfoils of kinetic energy to estimate power output,
governed by the Betz limit of propeller theory. Radial action generates torques
from impulses from air molecules at differing radii on rotor surfaces, both
windward and leeward. Dimensionally, torque is a rate of action. Integration of
the windward torque is achieved numerically using inputs of rotor dimensions,
the angle of incidence of elastic wind impulse on the blade surface, chord and
blade lengths and the tip speed ratio with wind speed. The rate of leeward or
back torque in the plane of rotation is estimated from radial impulses from the
blades rotation on material particles, with magnitude varying with the square
of the blade radius and its angular velocity. The net torque from these rates
of action and reaction is converted to power by its product with the angular
velocity of the turbine rotors, considered as an ideal cycle for wind turbines.
Its design should assist optimization of the aerodynamic elements of turbine
operation. A matter of concern must be predictions for a significant rate of
heat production by wind turbines, represented partly by the magnitude of the
leeward reaction torque but also by a greater release of heat downwind caused
by a turbulent cascade in the wake of air flow following its impacts with the
blades. Given the widespread occurrence of wind farms as sources of renewable
energy and a need to minimize environmental impacts this new method should
promote improved theory and practice regarding wind energy.

inside of the model (attention matrix Q, K, V, and the remaining part of the
attention layer (including the fully-connected layer, the residual connection,
and the layer normalization module) enhance the gender bias while the averaged
attentions reduces the bias).

we introduce such an important social-cognitive skill, i.e. Theory of Mind

cooperate effectively to accomplish challenging tasks. With ToM, each agent is
capable of inferring the mental states and intentions of others according to
its (local) observation. Based on the inferred states, the agents decide ""when""
and with ""whom"" to share their intentions. With the information observed,
inferred, and received, the agents decide their sub-goals and reach a consensus
among the team. In the end, the low-level executors independently take
primitive actions to accomplish the sub-goals. We demonstrate the idea in two
typical target-oriented multi-agent tasks: cooperative navigation and
multi-sensor target coverage. The experiments show that the proposed model not
only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on reward and communication
efficiency, but also shows good generalization across different scales of the
