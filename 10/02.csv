anomaly of proton, electron and anisotropy in the past works. In fact, there
exists twelve SNRs around solar system within $1$ kpc. One question is that can
other SNRs also possibly contribute the spectra of nuclei and electron and
explain the special structure of anisotropy? In this work, under the
spatial-dependent propagation, we systematically study the contribution of all
local SNRs within 1 kpc around solar to the spectra of nuclei and electron, as
well as the energy dependence of anisotropy. As a result, only Geminga,
Monogem, and Vela SNRs have quantitive contribution to the nuclei and electron
spectra and anisotropy. Here, Geminga SNR is the sole optimal candidate and
Monogem SNR is controversial due to the tension of anisotropy between model
calculation and observations. The Vela SNR contributes a new spectral structure
beyond TeV energy, hinted by HESS, VERITAS, DAMPE and CALET measurements. More
interesting is that the electron anisotropy satisfies the Fermi-LAT limit below
TeV energy, but rises greatly and reaches $10\%$ at several TeV. This new
structure will shed new light to check our model. We hope that the new
structure of electron spectrum and anisotropy can be observed by space-borne
DAMPE and HERD and ground-based HAWC and LHAASO experiments in the near future.

higher performance, supports richer functionality, and requires fewer lines of

volumetric geometry reconstruction to differentiable appearance reconstruction.
Unlike existing GPU hash maps, the ASH framework provides a versatile tensor
interface, hiding low-level details from the users. In addition, by decoupling
the internal hashing data structures and key-value data in buffers, we offer
direct access to spatially varying data via indices, enabling seamless
integration to modern libraries such as PyTorch. To achieve this, we 1) detach
stored key-value data from the low-level hash map implementation; 2) bridge the
pointer-first low level data structures to index-first high-level tensor
interfaces via an index heap; 3) adapt both generic and non-generic
integer-only hash map implementations as backends to operate on
multi-dimensional keys. We first profile our hash map against state-of-the-art
hash maps on synthetic data to show the performance gain from this
architecture. We then show that ASH can consistently achieve higher performance

applications, including 1) point cloud voxelization, 2) retargetable volumetric
scene reconstruction, 3) non-rigid point cloud registration and volumetric
deformation, and 4) spatially varying geometry and appearance refinement. ASH

adopting VEM on the agglomerated polyhedra yield critical time steps that are

automatically choosing explanation granularity to match the sensitivity of the

that limit the models' real-world potentials. To address these challenges, we
propose a new paradigm, Calibrating Concepts and Operations (CCO), which
enables neural symbolic models to capture underlying data characteristics and
to reason with hierarchical importance. Specifically, we introduce an executor
with learnable concept embedding magnitudes for handling distribution
imbalance, and an operation calibrator for highlighting important operations
and suppressing redundant ones. Our experiments show CCO substantially boosts
the performance of neural symbolic methods on real images. By evaluating models
on the real world dataset GQA, CCO helps the neural symbolic method NSCL
outperforms its vanilla counterpart by 9.1% (from 47.0% to 56.1%); this result
also largely reduces the performance gap between symbolic and non-symbolic
methods. Additionally, we create a perturbed test set for better understanding
and analyzing model performance on real images. Code is available at

vertex-weights and where new vertices attach to $m\in\mathbb N$ predecessors,
each selected independently with a probability proportional to the

rate of the maximum degree of the WRG model and here we show that there exists
a critical exponent $\mu_m$, such that the typical label size of the maximum

effective methods to slow the spread of the coronavirus and reduce the
overloading of healthcare is to wear a face mask. Nevertheless, to mandate the
use of face masks or coverings in public areas, additional human resources are
required, which is tedious and attention-intensive. To automate the monitoring
process, one of the promising solutions is to leverage existing object
detection models to detect the faces with or without masks. As such, security
officers do not have to stare at the monitoring devices or crowds, and only
have to deal with the alerts triggered by the detection of faces without masks.
Existing object detection models usually focus on designing the CNN-based
network architectures for extracting discriminative features. However, the size
of training datasets of face mask detection is small, while the difference
between faces with and without masks is subtle. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a face mask detection framework that uses the context attention module
to enable the effective attention of the feed-forward convolution neural
network by adapting their attention maps feature refinement. Moreover, we
further propose an anchor-free detector with Triplet-Consistency Representation
Learning by integrating the consistency loss and the triplet loss to deal with
the small-scale training data and the similarity between masks and occlusions.
Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the other
state-of-the-art methods. The source code is released as a public download to

interactions such as a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a Kane-Mele
coupling for the Mott-insulating phase at half-filling. For the twisted TMD
homobilayers, the spin-orbit coupling in the Hubbard model, which is expected
to induce the antisymmetric exchange couplings in the effective spin
Hamiltonian, is a highly tunable and experimentally accessible quantity that
can be tuned by an applied electric field. In this study, we investigate
classical and quantum phase diagrams of the effective spin Hamiltonian using
analytical and numerical methods. We show that the model exhibits a rich
classical phase diagram including an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, a planar
spiral ordered phase with high classical degeneracy, a $z$-AFM phase, a
noncoplanar phase, a noncollinear phase, and a 120$^{\circ}$-AFM phase. In the
quantum treatment, we calculate low-energy magnon excitation spectrum, ground
state energy, and static spin structure factor using linear spin-wave theory

diagram of the effective spin Hamiltonian. Beyond the Heisenberg interaction,
we find that the existence of these antisymmetric couplings is responsible for

Twisted TMD homobilayers, therefore, offer rich platforms for realizing rich

topological insulator that exhibits quantum AHE in exfoliated nanoflakes.
However, its complicated AHE behaviors may offer an opportunity for the
unexplored correlation between magnetism and band structure. Here, we show the

utilizing a high-dielectric SrTiO3 as the back-gate, we unveil an ambipolar
conduction and electron-hole carrier (n-p) transition in ~7 septuple layer
MnBi2Te4. A quadratic relation between the saturated AHE resistance and
longitudinal resistance suggests its intrinsic AHE mechanism. For ~3 septuple
layer MnBi2Te4, however, the AHE reverses its sign from pristine negative to
positive under the electric-gating. The first-principles calculations
demonstrate that such behavior is due to the competing Berry curvature between
polarized spin-minority-dominated surface states and spin-majority-dominated
inner-bands. Our results shed light on the physical mechanism of the
gate-tunable intrinsic AHE in MnBi2Te4 thin films and provide a feasible

Previously, this problem was solved for linear time-invariant (LTI) system for

iterative learning control framework, which we refer to as robust
learning-based model predictive control (RL-MPC). However, this work does not
apply to the case when only noisy observations of part of the state are

First, in practical applications we typically do not have access to the full
state. Second, uncertainties in the observations, when not accounted for, can
lead to instability and constraint violations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a combination of RL-MPC with robust output feedback model predictive
control, named robust learning-based output feedback model predictive control
(RLO-MPC). We show recursive feasibility and stability, and prove theoretical

that is, ones that reflect fine-grained geometry of animals, and that are often
specific to customized behavioral tasks. Due to visual and geometric ambiguity,
nonexperts are often not qualified for secondary landmark annotation, which can
require anatomical and zoological knowledge. These barriers significantly
impede downstream behavioral studies because the learned tracking models
exhibit limited generalizability. We hypothesize that there exists a shared
representation between the primary and secondary landmarks because the range of
motion of the secondary landmarks can be approximately spanned by that of the
primary landmarks. We present a method to learn this spatial relationship of
the primary and secondary landmarks in three dimensional space, which can, in
turn, self-supervise the secondary landmark detector. This 3D representation
learning is generic, and can therefore be applied to various multiview settings
across diverse organisms, including macaques, flies, and humans.

between the mathematical representations of a true physical system and its
imperfect model is called the model error. These model errors can lead to
substantial differences between the numerical solutions of the model and the
state of the system, particularly in those involving nonlinear, multi-scale
phenomena. Thus, there is increasing interest in reducing model errors,
particularly by leveraging the rapidly growing observational data to understand
their physics and sources. Here, we introduce a framework named MEDIDA: Model
Error Discovery with Interpretability and Data Assimilation. MEDIDA only
requires a working numerical solver of the model and a small number of
noise-free or noisy sporadic observations of the system. In MEDIDA, first the
model error is estimated from differences between the observed states and
model-predicted states (the latter are obtained from a number of one-time-step
numerical integrations from the previous observed states). If observations are
noisy, a data assimilation (DA) technique such as ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)
is employed to provide the analysis state of the system, which is then used to
estimate the model error. Finally, an equation-discovery technique, here the
relevance vector machine (RVM), a sparsity-promoting Bayesian method, is used
to identify an interpretable, parsimonious, and closed-form representation of
the model error. Using the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system as the test
case, we demonstrate the excellent performance of MEDIDA in discovering
different types of structural/parametric model errors, representing different
types of missing physics, using noise-free and noisy observations.

to be qualitatively well described by the Mean-Field theory, however the
related self-consistent problem so far has only been able to predict a partial
suppression of the transition even with proper account of classical lattice
fluctuations. Here the Hartree-Fock approximation scheme is extended to the
full quantum regime, by mapping the momentum-frequency spectrum of
order-parameter fluctuations onto a continuous two-parameter space. For the
one-dimensional half-filled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model the ratio $d=\Omega/2\pi
T_c^0$, where $\Omega$ is the characteristic phonon frequency and $2\pi T_c^0$
the lowest finite phonon Matsubara frequency at the mean-field critical point
$T_c^0$, provides a natural measure of the adiabaticity of lattice
fluctuations. By integrating out finite-frequency phonons, it is found that a
variation of $d$ from the classical regime $d=0$ continuously connects $T_c^0$
to a zero-temperature charge-density-wave transition setting up at a finite
crossover $d=d_c$. This finite crossover decreases within the range $0\leq d
\approx 1$ as the electron-phonon coupling strength increases but remaining
small enough for weak-coupling considerations to still hold. Implications of
$T_c$ supression on the Ginzburg criterion is discussed, and evidence is given
of a possible coherent description of the charge-density-wave problem within
the framework of a renormalized Mean-Field theory encompassing several aspects
of the transition including its thermodynamics close to the quantum critical

a simple grid search. Hence, this paper proposes weight vector tuning of a
generic binary linear classifier through the parameterization of a
decomposition of the discriminant by a scalar which controls the trade-off
between conflicting informative and noisy terms. By varying this parameter, the
original weight vector is modified in a meaningful way. Applying this method to
a number of linear classifiers under a variety of data dimensionality and
sample size settings reveals that the classification performance loss due to
non-optimal native hyperparameters can be compensated for by weight vector
tuning. This yields computational savings as the proposed tuning method reduces
to tuning a scalar compared to tuning the native hyperparameter, which may
involve repeated weight vector generation along with its burden of
optimization, dimensionality reduction, etc., depending on the classifier. It
is also found that weight vector tuning significantly improves the performance
of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) under high estimation noise. Proceeding
from this second finding, an asymptotic study of the misclassification
probability of the parameterized LDA classifier in the growth regime where the
data dimensionality and sample size are comparable is conducted. Using random
matrix theory, the misclassification probability is shown to converge to a
quantity that is a function of the true statistics of the data. Additionally,
an estimator of the misclassification probability is derived. Finally,
computationally efficient tuning of the parameter using this estimator is
demonstrated on real data.

training with marginal likelihood, the deterministic nature of feature
extractor might lead to overfitting while the replacement with a Bayesian
network seemed to cure it. Here, we propose the conditional Deep Gaussian
Process (DGP) in which the intermediate GPs in hierarchical composition are
supported by the hyperdata and the exposed GP remains zero mean. Motivated by
the inducing points in sparse GP, the hyperdata also play the role of function
supports, but are hyperparameters rather than random variables. We follow our
previous moment matching approach to approximate the marginal prior for
conditional DGP with a GP carrying an effective kernel. Thus, as in empirical
Bayes, the hyperdata are learned by optimizing the approximate marginal
likelihood which implicitly depends on the hyperdata via the kernel. We shall
show the equivalence with the deep kernel learning in the limit of dense
hyperdata in latent space. However, the conditional DGP and the corresponding
approximate inference enjoy the benefit of being more Bayesian than deep kernel
learning. Preliminary extrapolation results demonstrate expressive power from
the depth of hierarchy by exploiting the exact covariance and hyperdata
learning, in comparison with GP kernel composition, DGP variational inference
and deep kernel learning. We also address the non-Gaussian aspect of our model
as well as way of upgrading to a full Bayes inference.

  Enhancement","in submission",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A promising approach for multi-microphone speech separation involves two deep
neural networks (DNN), where the predicted target speech from the first DNN is
used to compute signal statistics for time-invariant minimum variance
distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming, and the MVDR result is then used as
extra features for the second DNN to predict target speech. Previous studies
suggested that the MVDR result can provide complementary information for the
second DNN to better predict target speech. However, on fixed-geometry arrays,
both DNNs can take in, for example, the real and imaginary (RI) components of
the multi-channel mixture as features to leverage the spatial and spectral
information for enhancement. It is not explained clearly why the linear MVDR
result can be complementary and why it is still needed, considering that the
DNNs and the beamformer use the same input, and the DNNs perform non-linear
filtering and could render the linear filtering of MVDR unnecessary. Similarly,
in monaural cases, one can replace the MVDR beamformer with a monaural weighted
prediction error (WPE) filter. Although the linear WPE filter and the DNNs use
the same mixture RI components as input, the WPE result is found to
significantly improve the second DNN. This study provides a novel explanation
from the perspective of the low-distortion nature of such algorithms, and finds
that they can consistently improve phase estimation. Equipped with this
understanding, we investigate several low-distortion target estimation
algorithms including several beamformers, WPE, forward convolutive prediction,

second network to achieve better enhancement. Evaluation results on single- and
multi-microphone speech dereverberation and enhancement tasks indicate the

represent many graph classes correctly. While more expressive graph
representation learning (GRL) alternatives can distinguish some of these
classes, they are significantly harder to implement, may not scale well, and
have not been shown to outperform well-tuned GNNs in real-world tasks. Thus,
devising simple, scalable, and expressive GRL architectures that also achieve
real-world improvements remains an open challenge. In this work, we show the
extent to which graph reconstruction -- reconstructing a graph from its
subgraphs -- can mitigate the theoretical and practical problems currently
faced by GRL architectures. First, we leverage graph reconstruction to build
two new classes of expressive graph representations. Secondly, we show how
graph reconstruction boosts the expressive power of any GNN architecture while
being a (provably) powerful inductive bias for invariances to vertex removals.
Empirically, we show how reconstruction can boost GNN's expressive power --
while maintaining its invariance to permutations of the vertices -- by solving
seven graph property tasks not solvable by the original GNN. Further, we
demonstrate how it boosts state-of-the-art GNN's performance across nine
real-world benchmark datasets.

is only one branch of an unimaginably fast-multiplying plethora of alternative

strand of pasta. By way of motivation, we first give a very simple presentation
of Bell's inequality by comparing it to a ``quantum game show'', followed by a
simple description of Aspect's 1985 experiment involving entangled photons

measurements as resulting from a process outside of spacetime that produces
both the original entanglement and the measurements. This is followed by a
brief presentation of MWI, and then by a pictorial comparison of the proposed
process model and MWI. The final section lists a number of potential

non-axisymmetric features, often interpreted as vortices. Numerical modeling
has repeatedly shown that gap-opening planets are capable of producing large
and long-lasting vortices at their outer gap edge, making massive planets
popular candidates as the source of such features. Aims: We explore the
lifetime of vortices generated by Jupiter-sized planets as a function of the
thermal relaxation timescale, the level of turbulence, and the effect of disk
self-gravity. Methods: We conduct 2D numerical simulations using the
hydrodynamics codes PLUTO and FARGO, scanning through several physical and
numerical parameters. Vortex properties are automatically extracted from
thousands of simulation snapshots. Results: We find that vortices that spawn at
the outer gap edge can survive for about 100-3000 planetary orbits, with the
shortest lifetimes occurring for moderately efficient dissipation and cooling.
However, we also observe a different regime of long-lasting vortices with
lifetimes of at least 15 000 orbits for very low viscosity and very short
thermal relaxation timescales. Disk self-gravity significantly shortens the
lifetime of regular vortices but still allows long-lived ones to survive.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the cooling timescale plays an important
role in vortex formation and lifetime and that planet-generated vortices should
be observable at large distances from the star for typical thermal relaxation
timescales and low turbulence levels.

significant effect on the observed kinematics, such as artificially increasing
the observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion.
  We analyse the binary fractions and distributions of 95 simulated GCs, with
and without an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in their centre. We show
that an IMBH will not only halt the segregation of binaries towards the cluster
centre, but also, directly and indirectly, disrupt the binaries that segregate,
thus depleting binaries in the cluster core. We illustrate this by showing that
clusters with an IMBH have fewer binaries and flatter radial binary
distributions than their counterparts without one. These differences in the
binary fraction and distribution provide an additional indicator for the
presence of a central IMBH in GCs. In addition, we analyse the effects of the
binary fraction on the line-of-sight velocity dispersion in the simulated GCs

to highly-controlled laboratory environments. Here, we employ a transfer
oscillator technique, which employs digital and RF analog electronics to
coherently suppress additive optical frequency comb noise. This relaxes the
stabilization requirements and allows for the extraction of multiple
independent microwave outputs from a single comb, while at the same time,
permitting low-noise microwave generation from combs with higher noise

saturation and photon blockade, problematic. Here we present another effect
occurring within the Tavis-Cummings model: a nonlinear response of the cavity
for resonant external driving of intermediate strength, which makes use of
large cavity dissipation rates. In this regime, $(N+1)$-photon processes
dominate when the cavity couples to $N$ emitters. We explore and characterize
this effect in detail, and provide a picture of how the effect occurs due to
destructive interference between the emitter ensemble and the external drive.
We find that a central condition for the observed effect is large
cooperativity, i.e., the product of the cavity and emitter decay rates is much
smaller than the collective cavity-emitter interaction strength squared.
Importantly, this condition does not require strong coupling. We also find an
analytical expression for the critical drive strength at which the effect
appears. Our results have potential for quantum state engineering, e.g., photon
filtering, and could be used for the characterization of cavity-emitter systems
where the number of emitters is unknown. In particular, our results open the

the infection spread of Covid-19 throughout the 2020-2021 years. However,
identifying a ""clean"" causal relation is not an easy task due to a high number
of non-observable (behavioral) effects. We suggest the usage of Google Trends
and News-based indexes as controls for some of these behavioral effects and we
find that a 1\% increase in residential mobility (i.e. a reduction in overall
mobility) have significant impacts for reducing both Covid-19 cases (at least
3.02\% on a one-month horizon) and deaths (at least 2.43\% at the two-weeks
horizon) over the 2020-2021 sample. We also evaluate the effects of mobility on
Covid-19 spread on the restricted sample (only 2020) where vaccines were not
available. The results of diminishing mobility over cases and deaths on the
restricted sample are still observable (with similar magnitudes in terms of
residential mobility) and cumulative higher, as the effects of restricting
workplace mobility turns to be also significant: a 1\% decrease in workplace
mobility diminishes cases around 1\% and deaths around 2\%.

their cooling age distribution is well fitted by a linear combination of the

recent years because of their possible link to extremely low-mass white dwarfs,
a rare class of objects resulting from binary evolution. Although most sdA
stars are consistent with metal-poor halo main-sequence stars, the formation
and evolution of a fraction of these stars are still matters of debate. The
identification of photometric variability can help to put further constraints
on the evolutionary status of sdA stars, in particular through the analysis of
pulsations. Moreover, the binary ratio, which can be deduced from eclipsing
binaries and ellipsoidal variables, is important as input for stellar models.
In order to search for variability due to either binarity or pulsations in
objects of the spectroscopic sdA class, we have extracted all available high
precision light curves from the Kepler K2 mission. We have performed a thorough
time series analysis on all available light curves, employing three different
methods. Frequencies with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than four have been
used for further analysis. From the 25 targets, 13 turned out to be variables
of different kinds (i.e. classical pulsating stars, ellipsoidal and cataclysmic
variables, eclipsing binaries, and rotationally induced variables). For the

left out after warm inflation, plays the role of quintessence field at late
times and is coupled to a non-conserved baryonic current. Assuming a four
fermion $(B-L)$ violating effective interaction, we have demonstrated that the
required baryon asymmetry can be produced successfully in this case. We show
that the post-inflationary evolution, with the underlying scalar field
potential, $V(\phi)=V^4_0 \exp{(-\alpha \phi^n/M_{\rm Pl}^4 ) }$, $n>1$ well
suited to warm inflation, exhibits scaling behaviour soon after a brief kinetic
regime. We show that the coupling of the scalar field to massive neutrino
matter can give rise to exit from the scaling regime to cosmic acceleration at
late times as massive neutrinos turn non-relativistic. The proposed model is
shown to successfully describe the cosmic history from inflation to late-time
acceleration, with the evolution independent of initial conditions, along with
the generation of baryon asymmetry during the post-inflationary era. A brief
analysis of relic gravity waves produced in the scenario is presented.

address this we present a delayed rejection variant: if an initial HMC
trajectory is rejected, we make one or more subsequent proposals each using a
step size geometrically smaller than the last. We extend the standard delayed
rejection framework by allowing the probability of a retry to depend on the
probability of accepting the previous proposal. We test the scheme in several
sampling tasks, including multiscale model distributions such as Neal's funnel,
and statistical applications. Delayed rejection enables up to five-fold
performance gains over optimally-tuned HMC, as measured by effective sample
size per gradient evaluation. Even for simpler distributions, delayed rejection
provides increased robustness to step size misspecification. Along the way, we
provide an accessible but rigorous review of detailed balance for HMC.

usually thought to be the dominant factors that produce the variations we see
in the observed emission line spectra. There is an increasing amount of
evidence that these two quantities are physically correlated, although the
exact form of this correlation is debatable in the literature. Simulated
emission line spectra from photoionized clouds provide important clues about
the physical conditions of HII regions and are frequently used for deriving
metallicities and ionization parameters. Through a systematic investigation on
the assumptions and methodology used in applying photoionization models, we
find that the derived correlation has a strong dependence on the choice of
model parameters. On the one hand, models that give consistent predictions over
multiple emission-line ratios yield a positive correlation between the
metallicity and ionization parameter for the general population of HII regions.
On the other hand, models that are inconsistent with the data locus in the
line-ratio space yield discrepant correlations when different subsets of line
ratios are used in the derivation. The correlation between the metallicity and
ionization parameter has a secondary dependence on the SFR surface density,
with the higher SFR regions showing higher ionization parameter but weaker
correlations. The existence of the positive correlation contradicts the
wind-driven bubble model for HII regions. We explore assumptions in the models
and conclude that there is a potential bias associated with the geometry.
However, this is still insufficient to explain the correlation. Mechanisms that
suppress the dynamical influence of stellar winds in realistic HII regions
might be the key to solving this puzzle, though more sophisticated combinations
of dynamical models and photoionization models to test are required.

the bias, we also examine the variance and mean squared error (MSE). In both
synthetic and realistic scenarios, we evaluate three estimators and find the
unbiased estimator has the highest variance, and the estimator with the
smallest variance has the largest bias; the estimator with the smallest MSE
strikes a balance between bias and variance, displaying a classic bias-variance
tradeoff. We use expected validation performance to compare between different
models, and analyze how frequently each estimator leads to drawing incorrect
conclusions about which of two models performs best. We find that the two
biased estimators lead to the fewest incorrect conclusions, which hints at the
importance of minimizing variance and MSE.

  This paper proposes Cuttlefish, a programming model oblivious C/C++ library
for achieving energy efficiency in multicore parallel programs running over
Intel processors. An online profiler periodically profiles model-specific
registers to discover a running application's memory access pattern. Using a
combination of DVFS and UFS, Cuttlefish then dynamically adapts the processor's
core and uncore frequencies, thereby improving its energy efficiency. The
evaluation on a 20-core Intel Xeon processor using a set of widely used OpenMP
benchmarks, consisting of several irregular-tasking and work-sharing pragmas,
achieves geometric mean energy savings of 19.4% with a 3.6% slowdown.

estimation scheme for a class of implicit two-time-scale nonlinear systems.
Taking the advantage of the two-time-scale separation, these processes are
decomposed into smaller subsystems such as fast subsystem and slow subsystem.
In the proposed method, an approach, composite solution, combines the
approximate solutions obtained from both fast and slow subsystems. Based on the
fast and slow subsystems, a distributed state estimation scheme is proposed to
handle the implicit time-scale multiplicity. In the proposed design, an
extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed for the fast subsystem and a moving
horizon estimator (MHE) is designed for the slow subsystem. There is a
communication between the estimators: the slow subsystem is only required to
send information to the fast subsystem one-directionally. The fast subsystem
estimator does not send out any information. The estimators use different
sampling of the state measurements, i.e., fast sampling of the fast state
variables is considered in the fast EKF and slow sampling of the slow state
variables is considered in the slow MHE. Extensive simulations based on a
chemical process are performed to illustrate the effectiveness and
applicability of the proposed subsystem decomposition and composite state
estimation architecture.

angular distributions. The density matrix formalism along with its multipole
expansions called statistical tensors is employed, enabling to perform a full
simulation of the angular correlation effects in a cascade of an arbitrary
number of {\gamma} transitions. A triple {\gamma} angular correlation
simulation is demonstrated for the first time. The present approach was coupled
with the Monte Carlo code FIFRELIN, which can simulate the de-excitation of
fission fragments or of excited nuclei after neutron capture. It provides a
complete description of the spatial distributions of all the {\gamma} rays in
the cascade, that can be used for simulation purposes in various applications

we train a neural network to estimate the field of view, camera pitch, and roll
given an input image. We employ novel losses that improve the calibration
accuracy over previous work. We then train a novel network that concatenates
the camera calibration to the image features and uses these together to regress
3D body shape and pose. SPEC is more accurate than the prior art on the
standard benchmark (3DPW) as well as two new datasets with more challenging
camera views and varying focal lengths. Specifically, we create a new
photorealistic synthetic dataset (SPEC-SYN) with ground truth 3D bodies and a

(FRB) -- enigmatic powerful radio pulses with durations of several milliseconds
and high brightness temperatures. The first observational evidence for this
scenario was obtained in 2020 April when a FRB was detected from the direction
of the Galactic magnetar and soft gamma-ray repeater SGR\,1935+2154. The FRB
was preceded by two gamma-ray outburst alerts by the BAT instrument aboard the
Swift satellite, which triggered follow-up observations by the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). H.E.S.S. has observed SGR\,1935+2154 for 2 hr
on 2020 April 28. The observations are coincident with X-ray bursts from the
magnetar detected by INTEGRAL and Fermi-GBM, thus providing the first very high
energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations of a magnetar in a flaring state.
High-quality data acquired during these follow-up observations allow us to
perform a search for short-time transients. No significant signal at energies
$E>0.6$~TeV is found and upper limits on the persistent and transient emission
are derived. We here present the analysis of these observations and discuss the
obtained results and prospects of the H.E.S.S. follow-up program for soft
gamma-ray repeaters.

observational data by accessing previously seen datasets associated with ground
truth causal relations. This paper presents a first attempt at addressing a
fundamental question: What are the benefits from supervision and how does it
benefit? Starting from seeing that SCL is not better than random guessing if
the learning target is non-identifiable a priori, we propose a two-phase
paradigm for SCL by explicitly considering structure identifiability. Following
this paradigm, we tackle the problem of SCL on discrete data and propose ML4C.
The core of ML4C is a binary classifier with a novel learning target: it
classifies whether an Unshielded Triple (UT) is a v-structure or not.
Specifically, starting from an input dataset with the corresponding skeleton
provided, ML4C orients each UT once it is classified as a v-structure. These
v-structures are together used to construct the final output. To address the
fundamental question of SCL, we propose a principled method for ML4C
featurization: we exploit the vicinity of a given UT (i.e., the neighbors of UT
in skeleton), and derive features by considering the conditional dependencies
and structural entanglement within the vicinity. We further prove that ML4C is
asymptotically correct. Last but foremost, thorough experiments conducted on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that ML4C remarkably outperforms other
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, reliability, robustness and
tolerance. In summary, ML4C shows promising results on validating the
effectiveness of supervision for causal learning. Our codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/microsoft/ML4C.

turbines to provide advanced power and load control capabilities. However, with
the ever increasing rotor sizes, the wind field over the rotor surface shows a
higher degree of spatial variation. A single effective wind speed estimation
therefore limits the attainable levels of load mitigation, and the estimation
of the Blade Effective Wind Speed (BEWS) might present opportunities for
improved load control. This letter introduces two novel BEWS estimator
approaches: A Proportional Integral Notch (PIN) estimator based on individual
blade load measurements, and a Coleman estimator targeting the estimation in
the non-rotating frame. Given the seeming disparities between these two
estimators, the objective of this letter is to analyze the similarities between
the approaches. It is shown that the PIN estimator, which is equivalent to the
diagonal form of the Coleman estimator, is a simple but effective method to
estimate the BEWS. The Coleman estimator, which takes the coupling effects
between individual blades into account, shows a more well behaved transient
response than the PIN estimator.

autonomous driving vehicles. In this work, we focus on the uncertainty in
sensing and perception, resulted from a limited field of view, occlusions, and
sensing range. This problem is often tackled by considering hypothetical hidden
objects in occluded areas or beyond the sensing range to guarantee passive
safety. However, this may result in conservative planning and expensive
computation, particularly when numerous hypothetical objects need to be
considered. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based solution to manage
uncertainty by optimizing for the worst case outcome. This approach is in
contrast to traditional RL, where the agents try to maximize the average
expected reward. The proposed approach is built on top of the Distributional RL
with its policy optimization maximizing the stochastic outcomes' lower bound.
This modification can be applied to a range of RL algorithms. As a
proof-of-concept, the approach is applied to two different RL algorithms, Soft
Actor-Critic and DQN. The approach is evaluated against two challenging
scenarios of pedestrians crossing with occlusion and curved roads with a
limited field of view. The algorithm is trained and evaluated using the SUMO
traffic simulator. The proposed approach yields much better motion planning
behavior compared to conventional RL algorithms and behaves comparably to
humans driving style.

state-of-the-art partial differential equation solvers. However, in finite
element methods, this poses an inherent difficulty: efficient quadrature rules
available when integrating functions whose discontinuity falls in the element's
interior are for low order degree polynomials, not easily extended to higher
order degree polynomials, and cover a restricted set of geometries. Many
approaches to this issue have been developed in recent years. Among them one of
the most elegant and versatile is the equivalent polynomial technique. This
method replaces the discontinuous function with a polynomial, allowing
integration to occur over the entire domain rather than integrating over
complex subdomains. Although eliminating the issues involved with discontinuous
function integration, the equivalent polynomial tactic introduces its problems.
The exact subdomain integration requires a machinery that quickly grows in
complexity when increasing the polynomial degree and the geometry dimension,
restricting its applicability to lower order degree finite element families.
The current work eliminates this issue. We provide algebraic expressions to
exactly evaluate the subdomain integral of any degree polynomial on parent
finite element shapes cut by a planar interface. These formulas also apply to
the exact evaluation of the embedded interface integral. We provide recursive
algorithms that avoid overflow in computer arithmetic for standard finite
element geometries: triangle, square, cube, tetrahedron, and prism, along with
a hypercube of arbitrary dimensions.

proof that any deterministic distributed algorithm that computes a

rounds and any randomized algorithm requires $\Omega(\log_\Delta\log n)$
rounds. We prove this result by showing that a natural relaxation of the
$\Delta$-coloring problem is a fixed point in the round elimination framework.
  As a first application, we show that our $\Delta$-coloring lower bound proof
directly extends to arbdefective colorings. We exactly characterize which
variants of the arbdefective coloring problem are ""easy"", and which of them
instead are ""hard"". As a second application, which we see as our main
contribution, we use the structure of the fixed point as a building block to
prove lower bounds as a function of $\Delta$ for a large class of distributed
symmetry breaking problems. For example, we obtain a tight lower bound for the
fundamental problem of computing a $(2,\beta)$-ruling set. This is an
exponential improvement over the best existing lower bound for the problem,
which was proven in [FOCS '20]. Our lower bound even applies to a much more
general family of problems that allows for almost arbitrary combinations of
natural constraints from coloring problems, orientation problems, and
independent set problems, and provides a single unified proof for known and new
lower bound results for these types of problems.
  Our lower bounds as a function of $\Delta$ also imply lower bounds as a
function of $n$. We obtain, for example, that maximal independent set, on

trajectories for a self-driving vehicle to follow. The trajectories are
generated through an optimization scheme to optimize a cost function based on
metrics related to smoothness, movability, and comfort, and subject to a set of
constraints derived from the planned behavior, safety considerations, and
feasibility. A common practice is to manually design the cost function and
constraints. Recent work has investigated learning the cost function from human
driving demonstrations. While effective, the practical application of such
approaches is still questionable in autonomous driving. In contrast, this paper
focuses on learning driving constraints, which can be used as an add-on module
to existing autonomous driving solutions. To learn the constraint, the planning
problem is formulated as a constrained Markov Decision Process, whose elements
are assumed to be known except the constraints. The constraints are then
learned by learning the distribution of expert trajectories and estimating the
probability of optimal trajectories belonging to the learned distribution. The

While the proposed solution follows the classical hierarchy of behavior
decision, motion planning and control, it introduces a key intermediate
abstraction within the motion planner to discretize the state-action space
according to high level behavioral decisions. We argue that this design allows
principled modular extension of motion planning, in contrast to using either
monolithic behavior cloning or a large set of hand-written rules. Moreover, we
demonstrate that our state-action space abstraction allows transferring of the
trained models without retraining from a simulated environment with virtually

However, the deep neural network, as the basic model of deep learning, has
suffered from issues such as local traps and miscalibration. In this paper, we
provide a new framework for sparse deep learning, which has the above issues
addressed in a coherent way. In particular, we lay down a theoretical
foundation for sparse deep learning and propose prior annealing algorithms for
learning sparse neural networks. The former has successfully tamed the sparse
deep neural network into the framework of statistical modeling, enabling
prediction uncertainty correctly quantified. The latter can be asymptotically
guaranteed to converge to the global optimum, enabling the validity of the
down-stream statistical inference. Numerical result indicates the superiority
of the proposed method compared to the existing ones.

State Information (CSI) in Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
systems. Map-assisted localization is an environment-aware approach in which
the communication system has information regarding the surrounding environment.
By combining radio frequency ray tracing parameters of the multipath components
(MPC) with the environment map, it is possible to accomplish localization.
Unfortunately, in real-world scenarios, ray tracing parameters are typically
not explicitly available. Thus, additional complexity is added at a base
station to obtain this information. On the other hand, CSI is a common
communication parameter, usually estimated for any communication channel. In
this work, we leverage the already available CSI data to propose a novel
map-assisted CSI localization approach, referred to as MAP-CSI. We show that
Angle-of-Departure (AoD) and Time-of-Arrival (ToA) can be extracted from CSI
and then be used in combination with the environment map to localize the user.
We perform simulations on a public MIMO dataset and show that our method works
for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. We compare
our method to the state-of-the-art (SoA) method that uses the ray tracing data.
Using MAP-CSI, we accomplish an average localization error of 1.8 m in LOS and
2.8 m in mixed (combination of LOS and NLOS samples) scenarios. On the other
hand, SoA ray tracing has an average error of 1.0 m and 2.2 m, respectively,
but requires explicit AoD and ToA information to perform the localization task.

led to novel techniques to classify ordered and disordered phases, as well as

methods to dynamical processes in complex networks is a field of active
research. Network-percolation, a measure of resilience and robustness to
structural failures, as well as a proxy for spreading processes, has numerous
applications in social, technological, and infrastructural systems. A
particular challenge is to identify the existence of a percolation cluster in a
network in the face of noisy data. Here, we consider bond-percolation, and
introduce a sampling approach that leverages the core-periphery structure of
such networks at a microscopic scale, using onion decomposition, a refined
version of the $k-$core. By selecting subsets of nodes in a particular layer of
the onion spectrum that follow similar trajectories in the percolation process,
percolating phases can be distinguished from non-percolating ones through an
unsupervised clustering method. Accuracy in the initial step is essential for
extracting samples with information-rich content, that are subsequently used to
predict the critical transition point through the confusion scheme, a recently
introduced learning method. The method circumvents the difficulty of missing
data or noisy measurements, as it allows for sampling nodes from both the core
and periphery, as well as intermediate layers. We validate the effectiveness of
our sampling strategy on a spectrum of synthetic network topologies, as well as
on two real-word case studies: the integration time of the US domestic airport

treatment regime rely on intention-to-treat analyses which estimate the effect
of following a certain dynamic treatment regime regardless of compliance
behavior of patients. There are two major concerns with intention-to-treat
analyses: (1) the estimated effects are often biased toward the null effect;
(2) the results are not generalizable and reproducible due to the potential
differential compliance behavior. These are particularly problematic in
settings with high level of non-compliance such as substance use disorder
treatments. Our work is motivated by the Adaptive Treatment for Alcohol and
Cocaine Dependence study (ENGAGE), which is a multi-stage trial that aimed to
construct optimal treatment strategies to engage patients in therapy. Due to
the relatively low level of compliance in this trial, intention-to-treat
analyses essentially estimate the effect of being randomized to a certain
treatment sequence which is not of interest. We fill this important gap by
defining the target parameter as the mean outcome under a dynamic treatment
regime given potential compliance strata. We propose a flexible non-parametric
Bayesian approach, which consists of a Gaussian copula model for the potential
compliances, and a Dirichlet process mixture model for the potential outcomes.
Our simulations highlight the need for and usefulness of this approach in

elicit adjustments in control allocation (e.g., those eliciting signals

when a given situation will give rise to a given control adjustment remain
poorly understood. Significant progress has recently been made on this front by
casting the allocation of control as a decision-making problem, and developing
unifying and normative models that prescribe when and how a change in

Despite their successes, these models, and the experiments that have been

engage at any given time. Here, we will lay out the complexities of the inverse

inverse problems within motor control (e.g., choosing between redundant limb

drawn from optimal control theory, which have proposed that effort costs act to
regularize actions and transform motor planning into a well-posed problem.
These same principles may help shed light on how our brains optimize over

design parameters: the point of an HSA's auxetic trajectory that is
energetically preferred, and the number of cells along the HSAs length.
Modeling the HSA as a programmable spring, we characterize the effect of both
on blocked force, minimum energy length, spring constant, angle range and
holding torque. We also examined the effect viscoelasticity has on actuation
forces over time. By varying the auxetic trajectory point, we were able to make
actuators that can push, pull, or do both. We expanded the range of forces
possible from 5N to 150N, and the range of stiffness from 2 N/mm to 89 N/mm.
For a fixed point on the auxetic trajectory, we found decreasing length can
improve force output, at the expense of needing higher torques, and having a
shorter throw. We also found that the viscoelastic effects can limit the amount

non-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric
defined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which
results in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental
exponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each
other. By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its
nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction
metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix
inequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known
linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems.
Furthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness
property of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison
lemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural
network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more
involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state
stability. Such distinctive features permit systematic construction of a
contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit
exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and
solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning
errors. The objective of this paper is therefore to present a tutorial overview
of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of
deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal
robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven
automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of
techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and
estimation laws using deep neural networks.

survey comprised of over 200 individual nights of observation between 2012
December 12 and 2019 March 14. After correcting for the limiting magnitude and
the spatial and temporal coverage of the survey, the nova rate in M83 was found
to be $R=19^{+5}_{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate, when normalized to the $K$-band
luminosity of the galaxy, yields a luminosity-specific nova rate, $\nu_K =
3.0^{+0.9}_{-0.6}\times10^{-10}$ yr$^{-1} L_{\odot,K}^{-1}$. The spatial
distribution of the novae is found to be more extended than the overall galaxy
light suggesting that the observed novae are likely dominated by a disk
population. This result is consistent with the observed nova light curves which
reveal that the M83 novae are on average more luminous at maximum light and
fade faster when compared with novae observed in M31. Generally, the more
luminous M83 novae were observed to fade more rapidly, with the complete sample
being broadly consistent with a linear Maximum-Magnitude vs Rate of Decline
relation.

refinement type annotations and uses them to prove that arithmetic operations

  To evaluate the usefulness of our type system, we use Solid to prove
arithmetic safety of a total of 120 smart contracts. When used in its fully
automated mode (i.e., using Solid's type inference capabilities), Solid is able
to eliminate 86.3% of redundant runtime checks used to guard against overflows.

annotations of cell subtypes are often done manually, which is time-consuming
and irreproducible. Garnett is a cell-type annotation software based the on
elastic net method. Besides cell-type annotation, supervised machine learning
methods can also be applied to predict other cell phenotypes from genomic data.
Despite the popularity of such applications, there is no existing study to
systematically investigate the performance of those supervised algorithms in
various sizes of scRNA-seq data sets.
  Methods and Results: This study evaluates 13 popular supervised machine
learning algorithms to classify cell phenotypes, using published real and
simulated data sets with diverse cell sizes. The benchmark contained two parts.
In the first part, we used real data sets to assess the popular supervised
algorithms' computing speed and cell phenotype classification performance. The
classification performances were evaluated using AUC statistics, F1-score,
precision, recall, and false-positive rate. In the second part, we evaluated
gene selection performance using published simulated data sets with a known
list of real genes.
  Conclusion: The study outcomes showed that ElasticNet with interactions
performed best in small and medium data sets. NB was another appropriate method
for medium data sets. In large data sets, XGB works excellent. Ensemble
algorithms were not significantly superior to individual machine learning
methods. Adding interactions to ElasticNet can help, and the improvement was
significant in small data sets.

on LA images. Multi-view SA-LA model assembles an extremely rich set of

maps learned from matched SA and LA cardiac MR images. Segmentation performance
is further enhanced by: (1) incorporating spatial context of LV as a prior and
(2) performing deep supervision in the last three layers of the decoder branch.

defy predictions of statistical learning and pose conceptual challenges for
non-convex optimization. In this paper, we use methods from statistical physics
of disordered systems to analytically study the computational fallout of
overparameterization in non-convex binary neural network models, trained on
data generated from a structurally simpler but ""hidden"" network. As the number
of connection weights increases, we follow the changes of the geometrical

so-called interpolation point, when solutions begin to exist (perfect fitting
becomes possible). This transition reflects the properties of typical
solutions, which however are in sharp minima and hard to sample. After a gap, a
second transition occurs, with the discontinuous appearance of a different kind
of ""atypical"" structures: wide regions of the weight space that are
particularly solution-dense and have good generalization properties. The two
kinds of solutions coexist, with the typical ones being exponentially more
numerous, but empirically we find that efficient algorithms sample the
atypical, rare ones. This suggests that the atypical phase transition is the
relevant one for learning. The results of numerical tests with realistic
networks on observables suggested by the theory are consistent with this

discriminatively prefer some of the neurons to be refined during the training

DAM approach has remarkably good performance over various applications,
including dimensionality reduction, recommendation system, graph representation
learning, and structured pruning for image classification. We also
theoretically show that the learning objective of DAM is directly related to

training, and even undergraduate physics. In contrast, there has been no change
in the basic theory taught to aeronautical or aerospace engineers. What has
changed is technology, both experimentally and computationally. The internet
and social media have also empowered citizen science such that the deficiencies
in the legacy physics education around flight and lift are well known. The
long-standing equal transit time (ETT) theory to explain lift has been proven
false. If incorrect, why was it ever taught? Through a historical analysis of
relevant fluid and aerodynamics literature, this study attempts to explain why
ETT theory is part of our collectively lower-level cognitive understanding of
lift and flight. It was found that in 1744 D'Alembert himself assumed this to
be a feature of moving fluids, and while this initial intuition (ETT 1.0) was
incorrect, the property of ETT (ETT 2.0) was derived in 1752 when applying
Newton's laws of motion to fluids. This incorrect result was independently
confirmed in 1757 by Euler! The conclusion is that an over simplified treatment
of fluids predicts ETT, along with no lift and drag. This then leads to the
open question, can ETT be taught at an appropriately low level as an
explanation for lift?

formal robustness guarantees for learning-based control frameworks, utilizing
contraction theory as an analytical tool to study the nonlinear stability of
learned systems via convex optimization. In particular, we rigorously show in
this paper that, by regarding modeling errors of the learning schemes as

solution trajectories, which exponentially decreases with time even under the

platforms, and microwave links that operate on frequency bands such as Ka-band
or higher are extremely susceptible to rain. Thus, rain fade forecasting for
these systems is critical because it allows the system to switch between ground
gateways proactively before a rain fade event to maintain seamless service.
Although empirical, statistical, and fade slope models can predict rain fade to
some extent, they typically require statistical measurements of rain
characteristics in a given area and cannot be generalized to a large scale
system. Furthermore, such models typically predict near-future rain fade events
but are incapable of forecasting far into the future, making proactive resource
management more difficult. In this paper, a deep learning (DL)-based
architecture is proposed that forecasts future rain fade using satellite and
radar imagery data as well as link power measurements. Furthermore, the data
preprocessing and architectural design have been thoroughly explained and
multiple experiments have been conducted. Experiments show that the proposed DL
architecture outperforms current state-of-the-art machine learning-based
algorithms in rain fade forecasting in the near and long term. Moreover, the
results indicate that radar data with weather condition information is more
effective for short-term prediction, while satellite data with cloud movement

Li et al. proposed a learned approach named AdaptNN to support adaptive ANN
query processing. In the middle of query execution, AdaptNN collects a number
of runtime features and predicts termination condition for each individual
query, by which better end-to-end latency is attained. Despite its efficiency,
using runtime features complicates the learning process and leads to
performance degradation. Radically different from AdaptNN, we argue that it is
promising to predict termination condition before query exetution.
Particularly, we developed Tao, a general learning framework for Terminating
ANN queries Adaptively using Only static features. Upon the arrival of a query,
Tao first maps the query to a local intrinsic dimension (LID) number, and then
predicts the termination condition using LID instead of runtime features. By
decoupling prediction procedure from query execution, Tao eliminates the
laborious feature selection process involved in AdaptNN. Besides, two design
principles are formulated to guide the application of Tao and improve the
explainability of the prediction model. We integrate two state-of-the-art
indexing approaches, i.e., IMI and HNSW, into Tao, and evaluate the performance
over several million to billion-scale datasets. Experimental results show that,
in addition to its simplicity and generality , Tao achieves up to 2.69x speedup

highly tunable spin physics and spin-related technology. Two-dimensional (2D)
magnons in van der Waals magnets are collective excitation of spins under
strong confinement. Although considerable progress has been made in
understanding 2D magnons, a crucial magnon device called the van der Waals
magnon valve, in which the magnon signal can be completely and repeatedly
turned on and off electrically, has yet to be realized. Here we demonstrate
such magnon valves based on van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator MnPS3. By
applying DC electric current through the gate electrode, we show that the
second harmonic thermal magnon (SHM) signal can be tuned from positive to
negative. The guaranteed zero crossing during this tuning demonstrates a
complete blocking of SHM transmission, arising from the nonlinear gate
dependence of the non-equilibrium magnon density in the 2D spin channel. Using
the switchable magnon valves we demonstrate a magnon-based inverter. These
results illustrate the potential of van der Waals anti-ferromagnets for

fully capitalize on the dimensionality reduction feature of the boundary
integral methods, shape sensitivities must ideally involve evaluating the
physical variables on the particle or pump boundaries only. We show that this
can indeed be accomplished owing to the linearity of Stokes flow. The forward
problem solves for the particle motion in a slip-driven pipe flow while the
adjoint problems in our construction solve quasi-static Dirichlet boundary
value problems backwards in time, retracing the particle evolution. The shape
sensitivities simply depend on the solution of one forward and one adjoint (for

unexplored, such as outlier detection and robustness. Existing functional
outlier detection methods are mainly used for ordinary functional data and
usually perform poorly when applied to PDFs. To fill this gap, this study
focuses on PDF-valued outlier detection, as well as its application in robust
distributional regression. Similar to ordinary functional data, detecting the
shape outlier masked by the ""curve net"" formed by the bulk of the PDFs is the
major challenge in PDF-outlier detection. To this end, we propose a
tree-structured transformation system for feature extraction as well as
converting the shape outliers to easily detectable magnitude outliers, relevant
outlier detectors are designed for the specific transformed data. A multiple
detection strategy is also proposed to account for detection uncertainties and
to combine different detectors to form a more reliable detection tool.
Moreover, we propose a distributional-regression-based approach for detecting
the abnormal associations of PDF-valued two-tuples. As a specific application,
the proposed outlier detection methods are applied to robustify a
distribution-to-distribution regression method, and we develop a robust
estimator for the regression operator by downweighting the detected outliers.
The proposed methods are validated and evaluated by extensive simulation

CeO$_2$-(111) surface exhibits a robust surface spin polarization due to the

the surface oxygen vacancy formation energy and enhance the oxide reducibility.
We show that the inclusion of spin polarization can therefore significantly
reduce the major activation barrier in the proposed reaction pathway of CO

surface spin polarization enhances the bonding between Pt nanoparticle and

Google's multilingual NMT, has ability to perform zero-shot translation and the
iterative self-learning algorithm can improve the quality of zero-shot
translation, it confronts with two problems: the multilingual NMT model is
prone to generate wrong target language when implementing zero-shot
translation; the self-learning algorithm, which uses beam search to generate
synthetic parallel data, demolishes the diversity of the generated source
language and amplifies the impact of the same noise during the iterative
learning process. In this paper, we propose the tagged-multilingual NMT model
and improve the self-learning algorithm to handle these two problems. Firstly,
we extend the Google's multilingual NMT model and add target tokens to the
target languages, which associates the start tag with the target language to
ensure that the source language can be translated to the required target
language. Secondly, we improve the self-learning algorithm by replacing beam
search with random sample to increases the diversity of the generated data and
makes it properly cover the true data distribution. Experimental results on
IWSLT show that the adjusted tagged-multilingual NMT separately obtains 9.41

rapid neutron capture process or $r$-process is intimately related to the
competition between neutron capture and $\beta$-decay rates, which ultimately
depends on the binding energy of neutron-rich nuclei. The well-known
Bethe-Weizs\""acker semi-empirical mass formula\cite{weiz,bethe} describes the
binding energy of ground states -- i.e. nuclei with temperatures of $T\approx0$
MeV -- with the symmetry energy parameter converging between $23-27$ MeV for
heavy nuclei. Here we find an unexpected enhancement of the symmetry energy at
higher temperatures, $T\approx0.7-1.0$ MeV, from the available data of giant
dipole resonances built on excited states. Although these are likely the
temperatures where seed elements are created -- during the cooling down of the
ejecta following neutron-star mergers\cite{mergersnucleo} or
collapsars\cite{collapsar} -- the fact that the symmetry energy remains
constant between $T\approx0.7-1.0$ MeV, suggests a similar trend down to
$T\approx0.5$ MeV, where neutron-capture may start occurring. Calculations
using this relatively larger symmetry energy yield a reduction of the binding
energy per nucleon for heavy neutron-rich nuclei and inhibits radiative
neutron-capture rates. This results in a substantial close in of the neutron
dripline -- where nuclei become unbound -- which elucidates the long sought
universality of heavy-element abundances through the $r$-process; as inferred
from the similar abundances found in extremely metal-poor stars and the Sun.

Direct selenization of Cu(111) gives rise to the formation of honeycomb CuSe
monolayers with 1D moir\'e structures (stripe-CuSe), due to the asymmetric
lattice distortions in CuSe induced by the lattice mismatch. Additional
deposition of Se combined with post annealing results in the formation of
honeycomb CuSe with quasi-ordered arrays of triangular holes (hole-CuSe),
namely, the structural transition from stripe-CuSe to hole-CuSe. Further,
annealing the hole-CuSe at higher temperature leads to the reverse structural
transition, namely from hole-CuSe to stripe-CuSe. AES measurement unravels the
Se content change in the reversible structural transition. Therefore, both the
Se coverage and annealing temperature play significant roles in the reversible
structural transition in CuSe on Cu(111). Our work provides insights in

model in the meta-learning framework. The standard benchmarks in meta-learning
are challenged by learning on diverse task distributions. The proposed network
learns the regularization function in a variational model and reconstructs MR
images with various under-sampling ratios or patterns that may or may not be
seen in the training data by leveraging a heterogeneous dataset. Methods: We
propose an unrolling network induced by learnable optimization algorithms (LOA)
for solving our nonconvex nonsmooth variational model for MRI reconstruction.
In this model, the learnable regularization function contains a task-invariant
common feature encoder and task-specific learner represented by a shallow
network. To train the network we split the training data into two parts:
training and validation, and introduce a bilevel optimization algorithm. The
lower-level optimization trains task-invariant parameters for the feature
encoder with fixed parameters of the task-specific learner on the training
dataset, and the upper-level optimizes the parameters of the task-specific
learner on the validation dataset. Results: The average PSNR increases
significantly compared to the network trained through conventional supervised
learning on the seen CS ratios. We test the result of quick adaption on the
unseen tasks after meta-training and in the meanwhile saving half of the
training time; Conclusion: We proposed a meta-learning framework consisting of
the base network architecture, design of regularization, and bi-level
optimization-based training. The network inherits the convergence property of
the LOA and interpretation of the variational model. The generalization ability
is improved by the designated regularization and bilevel optimization-based
training algorithm.

assignment of a vector $u_v \in \mathbb{F}^t$ to every vertex $v$ of $G$, such
that $\langle u_v,u_v \rangle \neq 0$ for every vertex $v$ and $\langle

of the orthogonal representation is the largest dimension of a subspace spanned
by the vectors associated with a closed neighborhood in the graph. We introduce
a novel graph parameter, called the local orthogonality dimension, defined for
a given graph $G$ and a given field $\mathbb{F}$, as the smallest possible
locality of an orthogonal representation of $G$ over $\mathbb{F}$. We
investigate the usefulness of topological methods for proving lower bounds on
the local orthogonality dimension. We prove that graphs for which topological
methods imply a lower bound of $t$ on their chromatic number have local
orthogonality dimension at least $\lceil t/2 \rceil +1$ over every field,
strengthening a result of Simonyi and Tardos on the local chromatic number. We
show that for certain graphs this lower bound is tight, whereas for others, the
local orthogonality dimension over the reals is equal to the chromatic number.
More generally, we prove that for every complement of a line graph, the local
orthogonality dimension over $\mathbb{R}$ coincides with the chromatic number.
This strengthens a recent result by Daneshpajouh, Meunier, and Mizrahi, who
proved that the local and standard chromatic numbers of these graphs are equal.
As another extension of their result, we prove that the local and standard
chromatic numbers are equal for some additional graphs, from the family of
Kneser graphs. We also show an $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness result for the local
orthogonality dimension and present an application of this graph parameter to
the index coding problem from information theory.

Single Labeled Domain Generalization (SLDG) task with only one source domain

major obstacle in the SLDG task is the discriminability-generalization bias:
the discriminative information in the labeled source dataset may contain
domain-specific bias, constraining the generalization of the trained model. To
tackle this challenging task, we propose a novel framework called
Domain-Specific Bias Filtering (DSBF), which initializes a discriminative model
with the labeled source data and then filters out its domain-specific bias with
the unlabeled source data for generalization improvement. We divide the
filtering process into (1) feature extractor debiasing via k-means
clustering-based semantic feature re-extraction and (2) classifier
rectification through attention-guided semantic feature projection. DSBF
unifies the exploration of the labeled and the unlabeled source data to enhance
the discriminability and generalization of the trained model, resulting in a
highly generalizable model. We further provide theoretical analysis to verify
the proposed domain-specific bias filtering process. Extensive experiments on

by analyzing the output characteristics of a solar cell, an improved MPPT

the maximum power point (MPP) of solar cell modules. To perform the task,
Bayesian Regularization method was chosen as the training algorithm as it works
best even for smaller data supporting the wide range of the train data set. The
theoretical results show that the improved NN MPPT algorithm has higher
efficiency compared with the Perturb and Observe method in the same
environment, and the PV system can keep working at MPP without oscillation and
probability of any kind of misjudgment. So it can not only reduce misjudgment,
but also avoid power loss around the MPP. Moreover, we implemented the
algorithm in a hardware set-up and verified the theoretical result comparing it
with the empirical data.

Galerkin approach combined with the MINRES linear solver and a discrete
differentiation rule and (2) a modification of a displacement FFT solver which
penalizes the indetermination of strains in the empty regions, leading to a

smooth out the lattice surface, based on modifying the actual stiffness of the
voxels not fully embedded in the lattice or empty space. The accuracy of the
resulting approaches is assessed for an octet-lattice by comparison with FEM
solutions for different relative densities and discretization levels. It is
shown that the adapted Galerkin approach combined with a Voigt surface

efficiency and h-convergence. With respect to numerical efficiency it was
observed that FFT becomes competitive compared to FEM for cells with relative
densities above 7%. Finally, to show the real potential of the approaches

on the trade-off behind the multiplicity of student-optimal assignments, the
incentive properties, and the problem's complexity. Due to the impossibility of
efficiently solving the problem with classical methods, we generalize existent
mathematical programming formulations of stability constraints to our setting,
most of which result in integer quadratically-constrained programs. In
addition, we propose a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation that
is exponentially-large on the problem size. We show that its stability
constraints can be separated in linear time, leading to an effective
cutting-plane method. We evaluate the performance of our approaches in a
detailed computational study, and we find that our cutting-plane method
outperforms mixed-integer programming solvers applied to the formulations
obtained by extending existing approaches. We also propose two heuristics that

To appear in ISAAC 2021",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The distributed subgraph detection asks, for a fixed graph $H$, whether the
$n$-node input graph contains $H$ as a subgraph or not. In the standard CONGEST
model of distributed computing, the complexity of clique/cycle detection and
listing has received a lot of attention recently.
  In this paper we consider the induced variant of subgraph detection, where
the goal is to decide whether the $n$-node input graph contains $H$ as an
\emph{induced} subgraph or not. We first show a $\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ lower bound
for detecting the existence of an induced $k$-cycle for any $k\geq 4$ in the
CONGEST model. This lower bound is tight for $k=4$, and shows that the induced
variant of $k$-cycle detection is much harder than the non-induced version.
This lower bound is proved via a reduction from two-party communication
complexity. We complement this result by showing that for $5\leq k\leq 7$, this
$\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ lower bound cannot be improved via the two-party
communication framework.
  We then show how to prove stronger lower bounds for larger values of $k$.
More precisely, we show that detecting an induced $k$-cycle for any $k\geq 8$
requires $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{2-\Theta{(1/k)}})$ rounds in the CONGEST model,
nearly matching the known upper bound $\tilde{O}(n^{2-\Theta{(1/k)}})$ of the
general $k$-node subgraph detection (which also applies to the induced version)
by Eden, Fiat, Fischer, Kuhn, and Oshman~[DISC 2019].
  Finally, we investigate the case where $H$ is the diamond (the diamond is
obtained by adding an edge to a 4-cycle, or equivalently removing an edge from
a 4-clique), and show non-trivial upper and lower bounds on the complexity of
the induced version of diamond detecting and listing.

whether in a given (random) graph there is a subgraph that is unusually dense.
Specifically, we observe an undirected and unweighted graph on $n$ nodes. Under
the null hypothesis, the graph is a realization of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph
with edge probability (or, density) $q$. Under the alternative, there is a
subgraph on $k$ vertices with edge probability $p>q$. The statistical as well
as the computational barriers of this problem are well-understood for a wide
range of the edge parameters $p$ and $q$. In this paper, we consider a natural
variant of the above problem, where one can only observe a small part of the
graph using adaptive edge queries.
  For this model, we determine the number of queries necessary and sufficient
for detecting the presence of the planted subgraph. Specifically, we show that
any (possibly randomized) algorithm must make $\mathsf{Q} =
\Omega(\frac{n^2}{k^2\chi^4(p||q)}\log^2n)$ adaptive queries (on expectation)
to the adjacency matrix of the graph to detect the planted subgraph with
probability more than $1/2$, where $\chi^2(p||q)$ is the Chi-Square distance.
On the other hand, we devise a quasi-polynomial-time algorithm that detects the
planted subgraph with high probability by making $\mathsf{Q} =
O(\frac{n^2}{k^2\chi^4(p||q)}\log^2n)$ non-adaptive queries. We then propose a
polynomial-time algorithm which is able to detect the planted subgraph using
$\mathsf{Q} = O(\frac{n^3}{k^3\chi^2(p||q)}\log^3 n)$ queries. We conjecture
that in the leftover regime, where $\frac{n^2}{k^2}\ll\mathsf{Q}\ll
\frac{n^3}{k^3}$, no polynomial-time algorithms exist. Our results resolve two
questions posed in \cite{racz2020finding}, where the special case of adaptive

require convergence and remain susceptible to changes in acoustic environments,

length. So far, empirical analysis of the PA-MFPADs has often been carried out
employing Young's formula in which each of the two atomic centers emits a
$s$-photoelectron wave. The PA-MFPADs, on the other hand, can consist of an
interference between the $p$-wave from the X-ray absorbing atom emitted along
the molecular axis and the $s$-wave scattered by neighboring atom, within the
framework of Multiple Scattering theory. The difference of this $p$-$s$ wave
interference from the commonly used $s$-$s$ wave interference causes a dramatic
change in the interference pattern, especially near the angles perpendicular to
the molecular axis. This change involves an additional fringe, urging us to
caution when using the conventional Young's formula for retrieving the bond
length. We have derived a new formula analogous to Young's formula but for the
$p$-$s$ wave interference. The bond lengths retrieved from the PA-MFPADs via
the new formula reproduce the original C-O bond lengths used in the reference
$ab$-$initio$ PA-MFPADs within the relative error of 5 %. In the high energy
regime, this new formula for $p$-$s$ wave interference converges to the
ordinary Young's formula for the $s$-$s$ wave interference. We expect it to be
used to retrieve the bond length for time-resolved PA-MFPADs instead of the
conventional Young's formula.

and allows for the maximization of the single-photon probabilities under
realistic conditions by optimizing the different input mean photon numbers
unit-wise and the detection strategy that can be defined in terms of actual
detected photon numbers. We apply this novel description to analyze periodic
single-photon sources based on asymmetric spatial multiplexing realized with
general asymmetric routers. We show that optimizing the different input mean
photon numbers results in maximal single-photon probabilities higher than those
achieved by using optimal identical input mean photon numbers in this setup. We
identify the parameter ranges of the system for which the enhancement in the
single-photon probability for the various detection strategies is relevant. An
additional advantage of the unit-wise optimization of the input mean photon
numbers is that it can result in the decrease of the optimal system size needed
to maximize the single-photon probability. We find that the highest
single-photon probability that our scheme can achieve in principle when
realized with state-of-the-art bulk optical elements is 0.935. This is the
highest one to our knowledge that has been reported thus far in the literature

Intelligence (AI-HLEG) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has
recently posed an interesting challenge to the eXplainable AI (XAI) community,
by demanding a more user-centred approach to explain Automated Decision-Making
systems (ADMs). Looking at the relevant literature, XAI is currently focused on
producing explainable software and explanations that generally follow an
approach we could term One-Size-Fits-All, that is unable to meet a requirement
of centring on user needs. One of the causes of this limit is the belief that
making things explainable alone is enough to have pragmatic explanations. Thus,
insisting on a clear separation between explainabilty (something that can be
explained) and explanations, we point to explanatorY AI (YAI) as an alternative
and more powerful approach to win the AI-HLEG challenge. YAI builds over XAI
with the goal to collect and organize explainable information, articulating it
into something we called user-centred explanatory discourses. Through the use
of explanatory discourses/narratives we represent the problem of generating
explanations for Automated Decision-Making systems (ADMs) into the
identification of an appropriate path over an explanatory space, allowing
explainees to interactively explore it and produce the explanation best suited
to their needs.

AI algorithms for structuring natural language documents into knowledge graphs,
answering questions effectively and satisfactorily. With this work we aim to
prove that the philosophical theory of explanations presented by Achinstein can
be actually adapted for being implemented into a concrete software application,
as an interactive and illocutionary process of answering questions.
Specifically, our contribution is an approach to frame illocution in a
computer-friendly way, to achieve user-centrality with statistical question
answering. Indeed, we frame the illocution of an explanatory process as that
mechanism responsible for anticipating the needs of the explainee in the form
of unposed, implicit, archetypal questions, hence improving the user-centrality
of the underlying explanatory process. Therefore, we hypothesise that if an
explanatory process is an illocutionary act of providing content-giving answers
to questions, and illocution is as we defined it, the more explicit and
implicit questions can be answered by an explanatory tool, the more usable its
explanations. We tested our hypothesis with a user-study involving more than 60
participants, on two XAI-based systems, one for credit approval and one for
heart disease prediction. The results showed that increasing the illocutionary
power of an explanatory tool can produce statistically significant improvements
on effectiveness. This, combined with a visible alignment between the
increments in effectiveness and satisfaction, suggests that our understanding

cases accurately. In contrast, the dominant model often fails to extract enough
information to measure precession. In particular, it cannot distinguish a
face-on highly precessing binary from a slowly precessing binary system
irrespective of the binary's mass ratio. As expected, we see a significant
improvement in measuring precession for edge-on binaries. Other intrinsic
parameters also become better constrained, indicating that precession effects
help break the correlations between mass and spin parameters. However, the
precession measurements are prior dominated for equal-mass binaries with
face-on orientation, even if we employ waveform model including subdominant
harmonics. In this case, doubling the signal-to-noise ratio does not help to
reduce these prior induced biases. As we expect detections of highly spinning
binary signals with misaligned spin orientations in the future, simulation
studies like ours are crucial for understanding the prospects and limitations
of GW parameter inferences.

  Valuations","41 pages",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of allocating indivisible goods among $n$ agents with
the objective of maximizing Nash social welfare (NSW). This welfare function is
defined as the geometric mean of the agents' valuations and, hence, it strikes
a balance between the extremes of social welfare (arithmetic mean) and
egalitarian welfare (max-min value). Nash social welfare has been extensively
studied in recent years for various valuation classes. In particular, a notable
negative result is known when the agents' valuations are complement-free and
are specified via value queries: for XOS valuations, one necessarily requires
exponentially many value queries to find any sublinear (in $n$) approximation
for NSW. Indeed, this lower bound implies that stronger query models are needed
for finding better approximations. Towards this, we utilize demand oracles and
XOS oracles; both of these query models are standard and have been used in
prior work on social welfare maximization with XOS valuations.
  We develop the first sublinear approximation algorithm for maximizing Nash
social welfare under XOS valuations, specified via demand and XOS oracles.
Hence, this work breaks the $O(n)$-approximation barrier for NSW maximization
under XOS valuations. We obtain this result by developing a novel connection
between NSW and social welfare under a capped version of the agents'
valuations. In addition to this insight, which might be of independent
interest, this work relies on an intricate combination of multiple technical
ideas, including the use of repeated matchings and the discrete moving knife
method. In addition, we partially complement the algorithmic result by showing
that, under XOS valuations, an exponential number of demand and XOS queries are
necessarily required to approximate NSW within a factor of $\left(1 -
\frac{1}{e}\right)$.

indirect reduction and incremental construction. Indirect reduction means the

it is reduced to a context-free grammar from which an LR(1) state machine is
derived. Furthermore, by considering the nodes in the graph to be colored one

of the subjects' results (83.3%) or simply asking their opinions (55.6%). Some
studies (16.7%) rely exclusively on the latter variable.There are still few
studies that monitor subjects' physical signs, such as brain activation regions
(5%). Moreover, our study shows that some variables are multi-faceted. For
instance, correctness can be measured as the ability to predict the output of a
program, answer questions about its behavior, or recall parts of it. These
results make it clear that different evaluation approaches require different
competencies from subjects, e.g., tracing the program vs. summarizing its goal
vs. memorizing its text. To assist researchers in the design of new studies and
improve our comprehension of existing ones, we model program comprehension as a
learning activity by adapting a preexisting learning taxonomy. This adaptation
indicates that some competencies are often exercised in these evaluations
whereas others are rarely targeted.

  Expansion","10 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Disentanglement learning aims to construct independent and interpretable
latent variables in which generative models are a popular strategy. InfoGAN is
a classic method via maximizing Mutual Information (MI) to obtain interpretable
latent variables mapped to the target space. However, it did not emphasize
independent characteristic. To explicitly infer latent variables with
inter-independence, we propose a novel GAN-based disentanglement framework via
embedding Orthogonal Basis Expansion (OBE) into InfoGAN network
(Inference-InfoGAN) in an unsupervised way. Under the OBE module, one set of
orthogonal basis can be adaptively found to expand arbitrary data with
independence property. To ensure the target-wise interpretable representation,
we add a consistence constraint between the expansion coefficients and latent
variables on the base of MI maximization. Additionally, we design an
alternating optimization step on the consistence constraint and orthogonal
requirement updating, so that the training of Inference-InfoGAN can be more
convenient. Finally, experiments validate that our proposed OBE module obtains
adaptive orthogonal basis, which can express better independent characteristics
than fixed basis expression of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). To depict the
performance in downstream tasks, we compared with the state-of-the-art
GAN-based and even VAE-based approaches on different datasets. Our
Inference-InfoGAN achieves higher disentanglement score in terms of FactorVAE,
Separated Attribute Predictability (SAP), Mutual Information Gap (MIG) and
Variation Predictability (VP) metrics without model fine-tuning. All the
experimental results illustrate that our method has inter-independence
inference ability because of the OBE module, and provides a good trade-off
between it and target-wise interpretability of latent variables via jointing
the alternating optimization.

where the objectives are learned functionals of signed-distance fields that

analytical models and carefully chosen abstractions/state-spaces to be
effective. A central question is how models can be obtained from data that are
not primarily accurate in their predictions, but, more importantly, enable
efficient reasoning within a planning framework, while at the same time being
closely coupled to perception spaces. We show that representing objects as
signed-distance fields not only enables to learn and represent a variety of
models with higher accuracy compared to point-cloud and occupancy measure
representations, but also that SDF-based models are suitable for
optimization-based planning. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we
learn both kinematic and dynamic models to solve tasks that involve hanging
mugs on hooks and pushing objects on a table. We can unify these quite
different tasks within one framework, since SDFs are the common object

previous works perform phoneme specific modification in CLP speech. In CLP
speech, both the articulation error and the nasalization distorts the
intelligibility of a word. Consequently, modification of a specific phoneme may
not always yield in enhanced entire word-level intelligibility. For such cases,
it is important to identify and isolate the phoneme specific error based on the
knowledge of acoustic events. Accordingly, the phoneme specific error
modification algorithms can be exploited for transforming the specified errors
and enhance the word-level intelligibility. Motivated by that, in this work, we
combine some of salient phoneme specific enhancement approaches and demonstrate
their effectiveness in improving the word-level intelligibility of CLP speech.
The enhanced speech samples are evaluated using subjective and objective

We propose and experimentally demonstrate a light-field microscopy architecture

three-dimensional test targets and biological samples out of the focused plane.
We improve the depth of field by a factor 6 with respect to conventional

control problems in an integrated way, which can be easier to generalize at
scale and be more adapting to new scenarios. However, high costs and risks make
it very hard to train autonomous cars in the real world. Simulations can
therefore be a powerful tool to enable training. Due to slightly different
observations, agents trained and evaluated solely in simulation often perform
well there but have difficulties in real-world environments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning approach called
Cycleconsistent World Models. Contrary to related approaches, our model can
embed two modalities in a shared latent space and thereby learn from samples in
one modality (e.g., simulated data) and be used for inference in different
domain (e.g., real-world data). Our experiments using different modalities in
the CARLA simulator showed that this enables CCWM to outperform
state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches. Furthermore, we show that CCWM
can decode a given latent representation into semantically coherent
observations in both modalities.

that a classifier should be disqualified if it is possible to improve its

quantify fairness and accuracy in a given task. Towards this objective, we
establish principled translations between units of accuracy and units of

ridges on an initially flat sediment bed is investigated with the aid of
particle-resolved direct numerical simulations of open channel flow at bulk
Reynolds numbers up to 9500. The regular arrangement of quasi-streamwise ridges
and troughs at a characteristic spanwise spacing between 1 and 1.5 times the
mean fluid height is found to be a consequence of the preferential spanwise
organization of turbulence in large-scale streamwise velocity streaks. Sediment
ridges predominantly appear in regions of weaker erosion below large-scale
low-speed streaks and vice versa for troughs. The interaction between the
dynamics of the large-scale streaks in the bulk flow and the evolution of
sediment ridges on the sediment bed is best described as a `top-down' process,
as the arrangement of the sediment bedforms is seen to adapt to changes in the
outer flow with a time delay of several bulk time units. The observed
`top-down' interaction between the outer flow and the bed agrees fairly well
with the conceptual model on causality in canonical channel flows proposed by
Jimenez (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 842, 2018, P1, section 5.6). Mean secondary
currents of Prandtl's second kind of comparable intensity and lateral spacing
are found over developed sediment ridges and in single-phase smooth-wall
channels alike in averages over O(10) bulk time units. This indicates that the
secondary flow commonly observed together with sediment ridges is the
statistical footprint of the regularly organized large-scale streaks.

mission-critical applications. In this regard, it is suggested to quantify the
freshness of updates by using Age of Information (AoI) from the receiver's
perspective. Specifically, the AoI measures the freshness over time. However,
the freshness in the content is neglected. In this paper, we introduce an
age-based utility, named as Age of Changed Information (AoCI), which captures
both the passage of time and the change of information content. By modeling the
underlying physical process as a discrete time Markov chain, we investigate the
AoCI in a time-slotted status update system, where a sensor samples the
physical process and transmits the update packets to the destination. With the
aim of minimizing the weighted sum of the AoCI and the update cost, we
formulate an infinite horizon average cost Markov Decision Process. We show
that the optimal updating policy has a special structure with respect to the
AoCI and identify the condition under which the special structure exists. By
exploiting the special structure, we provide a low complexity relative policy
iteration algorithm that finds the optimal updating policy. We further
investigate the optimal policy for two special cases. In the first case where
the state of the physical process transits with equiprobability, we show that
optimal policy is of threshold type and derive the closed-form of the optimal
threshold. We then study a more generalized periodic Markov model of the
physical process in the second case. Lastly, simulation results are laid out to
exhibit the performance of the optimal updating policy and its superiority over
the zero-wait baseline policy.

velocities, there are two primary dissipative mechanisms that control how
friction changes with sliding velocity: viscoelastic dissipation and adhesive
dissipation. To distinguish the contribution of these dissipative mechanisms we
have measured frictional shear stresses for crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) on three different rough surfaces of similar surface chemistry across
nearly six decades of sliding velocity. The results show that the observed
friction is dominated by adhesive dissipation, rather than viscoelastic
dissipation. Prior models for elastomer friction assume that roughness only
influences adhesive dissipation via the amount of contact area; by contrast, we
find that the roughness-induced oscillations occurring across all length scales
from macroscopic to atomic influence the molecular processes governing the
adhesive dissipation. While it was previously known that roughness-induced
oscillations affected the viscoelastic dissipation; this is the first
demonstration that these oscillations also control the behavior of the adhesive
component of friction. Finally, while theory predicts that rough friction
should be independent of elastic modulus ($E'$), we show that a strong
dependence on modulus, with the frictional shear stress scaling as $E'^{1/2}$.
When analyzed in this way, data from four different moduli and three different
roughnesses collapse onto a universal curve to describe the velocity-dependent
friction of soft materials. Taken together, this investigation sheds new light
on the adhesive component of friction, and how it depends on the roughness and
stiffness of the materials.

the appropriate models, when trained on long-duration wide-field image
presentations, exhibit similar temporal response dynamics and classical
contextual modulations as observed in V1 neurons. This work provides insights
to the computational rationale of recurrent circuits and suggests that neural
response prediction could be useful for characterizing the recurrent neural
circuits in the visual cortex.

version is to determine whether $H$ is trivial or not, and the goal of the
identification version is to identify $H$. An algorithm for the problem should
query $f(g)$ for $g\in G$ at least as possible. Nayak asked whether there exist
deterministic algorithms with $O(\sqrt{\frac{|G|}{|H|}})$ query complexity for
$\mathsf{HSP}$. We answer this problem by proving the following results, which
also extend the main results of Ref. [30], since here the algorithms do not
rely on any prior knowledge of $H$. (i)When $G$ is a general finite Abelian
group, there exist an algorithm with $O(\sqrt{\frac{|G|}{|H|}})$ queries to
decide the triviality of $H$ and an algorithm to identify $H$ with
$O(\sqrt{\frac{|G|}{|H|}\log |H|}+\log |H|)$ queries. (ii)In general there is
no deterministic algorithm for the identification version of $\mathsf{HSP}$
with query complexity of $O(\sqrt{\frac{|G|}{|H|}})$, since there exists an
instance of $\mathsf{HSP}$ that needs $\omega(\sqrt{\frac{|G|}{|H|}})$ queries
to identify $H$. $f(x)$ is said to be $\omega(g(x))$ if for every positive
constant $C$, there exists a positive constant $N$ such that for $x>N$,
$f(x)\ge C\cdot g(x)$, which means $g$ is a strict lower bound for $f$. On the
other hand, there exist instances of $\mathsf{HSP}$ with query complexity far
smaller than $O(\sqrt{\frac{|G|}{|H|}})$, whose query complexity is $O(\log
\frac{|G|}{|H|})$ and even $O(1)$.

observable behavior of their resulting composite components through
specifications of interactions of the behaviors of their constituent
components, as they, e.g., synchronize with or mutually exclude each other's
alternative behaviors. Our framework is expressive enough to allow articulation
of properties that coordinate desired interactions among composed components
within the framework, also as component behavior. We demonstrate the usefulness
of our formalism through examples of coordination properties in a CPS
consisting of two robots interacting through shared physical resources.

angles is becoming increasingly popular, in particular with the advent of
multimodal communication systems. Here, we address the hybrid network
localization problem using ranges and bearings to jointly determine the
positions of a number of agents through a single maximum-likelihood (ML)
optimization problem that seamlessly fuses all the available pairwise range and
angle measurements. We propose a tight convex surrogate to the ML estimator, we
examine practical measures for the accuracy of the relaxation, and we
comprehensively characterize its behavior in simulation. We found that our
relaxation outperforms a state of the art SDP relaxation by one order of
magnitude in terms of localization error, and is amenable to much more
lightweight solution algorithms.

presence of swimming microorganisms. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the
sedimentation of spherical colloids at various E. coli concentration within the
dilute regime. Results show the appearance of two sedimentation fronts, a
spherical particle front and the bacteria front. We find that the bacteria
front behave diffusive at short times, whereas at long times decays linearly.
The sedimentation speed of passive particles decays at a constant speed and
decreases as bacteria concentration ($\phi_b$) is increased. As $\phi_b$ is
increased further, the sedimentation speed becomes independent of $\phi_b$. The
timescales of the bacteria front is associated with the particle settling
speeds. Remarkably, all experiments collapse onto a single master line by using
the bacteria front timescale. A phenomenological model is proposed that
captures the sedimentation of passive particles in active fluids.

manipulation of flexible structures by external magnetic fields is a keystone
of future magnetoelectronics-based devices. This work studies the elastic
properties of a magnetoelastic nanodisc that hosts a meron as the magnetic
state and can be deformed from structures with positive to negative Gaussian
curvature. We show that the winding number of the hosted meron is crucial to
determine the curvature sign of the stable obtained shape. Additionally, we
show that the optimum curvature reached by the nanodisc depends on geometrical
and mechanical parameters. It is shown that an increase in the external radius,
thickness, and Young's modulus lead to a decrease in the optimum curvature
absolute value. Finally, it is shown that the nanodisc's shape also depends on
the connection between the polarity and chirality of the vortex-like meron.

"2110.05929","Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury","Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury, Nitin Rathi and Kaushik Roy","One Timestep is All You Need: Training Spiking Neural Networks with
  Ultra Low Latency",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are energy efficient alternatives to commonly
used deep neural networks (DNNs). Through event-driven information processing,
SNNs can reduce the expensive compute requirements of DNNs considerably, while
achieving comparable performance. However, high inference latency is a
significant hindrance to the edge deployment of deep SNNs. Computation over
multiple timesteps not only increases latency as well as overall energy budget
due to higher number of operations, but also incurs memory access overhead of
fetching membrane potentials, both of which lessen the energy benefits of SNNs.
To overcome this bottleneck and leverage the full potential of SNNs, we propose
an Iterative Initialization and Retraining method for SNNs (IIR-SNN) to perform
single shot inference in the temporal axis. The method starts with an SNN
trained with T timesteps (T>1). Then at each stage of latency reduction, the
network trained at previous stage with higher timestep is utilized as
initialization for subsequent training with lower timestep. This acts as a
compression method, as the network is gradually shrunk in the temporal domain.
In this paper, we use direct input encoding and choose T=5, since as per
literature, it is the minimum required latency to achieve satisfactory
performance on ImageNet. The proposed scheme allows us to obtain SNNs with up
to unit latency, requiring a single forward pass during inference. We achieve
top-1 accuracy of 93.05%, 70.15% and 67.71% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and
ImageNet, respectively using VGG16, with just 1 timestep. In addition, IIR-SNNs
perform inference with 5-2500X reduced latency compared to other
state-of-the-art SNNs, maintaining comparable or even better accuracy.
Furthermore, in comparison with standard DNNs, the proposed IIR-SNNs
provide25-33X higher energy efficiency, while being comparable to them in
classification performance.

architectures, (Kotseruba and Tsotsos 2020), evaluates modelling of the core
cognitive abilities in humans, but only marginally addresses biologically
plausible approaches based on natural computation. This mini review presents a
set of perspectives and approaches which have shaped the development of
biologically inspired computational models in the recent past that can lead to
the development of biologically more realistic cognitive architectures. For
describing continuum of natural cognitive architectures, from basal cellular to
human-level cognition, we use evolutionary info-computational framework, where
natural/ physical/ morphological computation leads to evolution of increasingly
complex cognitive systems. Forty years ago, when the first cognitive
architectures have been proposed, understanding of cognition, embodiment and
evolution was different. So was the state of the art of information physics,
bioinformatics, information chemistry, computational neuroscience, complexity
theory, self-organization, theory of evolution, information and computation.
Novel developments support a constructive interdisciplinary framework for
cognitive architectures in the context of computing nature, where interactions
between constituents at different levels of organization lead to
complexification of agency and increased cognitive capacities. We identify
several important research questions for further investigation that can
increase understanding of cognition in nature and inspire new developments of
cognitive technologies. Recently, basal cell cognition attracted a lot of
interest for its possible applications in medicine, new computing technologies,
as well as micro- and nanorobotics.

contribute to the wealth and well being of world society. The evolution of the
Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics is briefly described. In present days
remarkable development of all the modern technology, essential for the welfare
and progress of the global society, imposes an immense stress on basic Physics,
and consequently on Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics, in situations like,
for example: fluids with complex structures, electronics and photonics
involving systems out of equilibrium, nano-technologies, low-dimensional
systems, non-linear and ultrafast processes in semiconductors devices, and soft
matter. It is shown that the Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics can deal,
within a certain degree of triumph, with some these situations, namely: 1.
nonconventional thermo-hydrodynamics; 2. ultrafast relaxation processes in
semiconductors devices; 3. nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein-like condensations and
coherent states; 4. low-dimensional semiconductors; 5. thermo-statistics of
complex structured systems; 6. nonlinear higher-order thermo-hydrodynamics; and
7. nonlinear transport in semiconductors devices. These areas are of particular
interest, at the scientific, technological and at the production line, and
therefore of relevance for government and society, successfully analyzed in
terms of the formalism of Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics.
