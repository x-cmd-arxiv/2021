main genres of publication in literary and textual scholarship, and have a
century-long tradition. Yet, the exploitation of thousands of digitized

Character Recognition (OCR), especially on commentaries to Greek texts. In this
paper, we evaluate the performances of two pipelines suitable for the OCR of
historical classical commentaries. Our results show that Kraken + Ciaconna
reaches a substantially lower character error rate (CER) than Tesseract/OCR-D
on commentary sections with high density of polytonic Greek text (average CER
7% vs. 13%), while Tesseract/OCR-D is slightly more accurate than Kraken +
Ciaconna on text sections written predominantly in Latin script (average CER
8.2% vs. 8.4%). As part of this paper, we also release GT4HistComment, a small
dataset with OCR ground truth for 19th classical commentaries and Pogretra, a
large collection of training data and pre-trained models for a wide variety of

  Theory: Density Functional Theory and Beyond",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Machine learning thermodynamic perturbation theory (MLPT) is a promising
approach to compute finite temperature properties when the goal is to compare
several different levels of ab initio theory and/or to apply highly expensive
computational methods. Indeed, starting from a production molecular dynamics
trajectory, this method can estimate properties at one or more target levels of
theory from only a small number of additional fixed-geometry calculations,
which are used to train a machine learning model. However, as MLPT is based on
thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT), inaccuracies might arise when the
starting point trajectory samples a configurational space which has a small
overlap with that of the target approximations of interest. By considering case
studies of molecules adsorbed in zeolites and several different density
functional theory approximations, in this work we assess the accuracy of MLPT
for ensemble total energies and enthalpies of adsorption. The problematic cases
that were found are analyzed and it is shown that, even without knowing exact
reference results, pathological cases for MLPT can be detected by considering a
coefficient that measures the statistical imbalance induced by the TPT
reweighting. For the most pathological examples we recover target level results
within chemical accuracy by applying a machine learning-based Monte Carlo
(MLMC) resampling. Finally, based on the ideas developed in this work, we
assess and confirm the accuracy of recently published MLPT-based enthalpies of
adsorption at the random phase approximation level, whose high computational
cost would completely hinder a direct molecular dynamics simulation.

reactions can be modelled by dynamical systems which typically experience
bifurcations. Transients typically suffer extremely long delays at the vicinity
of bifurcations and it is also known that these transients follow scaling laws
as the bifurcation parameter gets closer the bifurcation value in deterministic
systems. The mechanisms involved in local bifurcations are well-known. However,
for saddle-node bifurcations, the relevant dynamics after the bifurcation occur
in the complex phase space. Hence, the mechanism responsible for the delays and
the associated inverse-square root scaling law for this bifurcation can be
better understood by looking at the dynamics in the complex space. We follow
this approach and complexify a simple ecological system undergoing a
saddle-node bifurcation. The discrete model describes a biological system with
facilitation (cooperation) under habitat destruction for species with
non-overlapping generations. We study the complex (as opposed to real) dynamics
once the bifurcation has occurred. We identify the fundamental mechanism
causing these long delays (called ghosts), given by two repellers in the
complex space. Such repellers appear to be extremely close to the real line,
thus forming a narrow channel close to the two new fixed points and responsible
for the slow passage of the orbits, which remains tangible in the real numbers
phase space. We analytically provide the relation between the inverse
square-root scaling law and the multipliers of these repellers. We finally
prove that the same phenomenon occurs for more general i.e., non-necessarily
polynomial, models.

the empirical similarity of these scores across heads and layers and find them

inequality indicator of the Theil index and decompose Theil to show within and
between-group inequalities. Second, a Threefold Oaxaca Decomposition is
employed to break the earnings differentials into components of endowment,

rural divisions. Within-group, inequalities are found larger than between
groups across variables; with a higher overall inequality for forward castes. A
high endowment is observed which implies pre-market discrimination in human
capital investment such as nutrition and education. Policymakers should first
invest in basic quality education and simultaneously expand post-graduate
diploma opportunities, subsequently increasing the participation in the labour
force for the traditionally disadvantaged in disciplines and occupations where

the differentiation of speakers in multi-turn conversations. Differing from
prior work that solely relies on the content of conversation history to
generate a response, we argue that capturing relative social relations among

benefits the machine capturing fine-grained context information from a
conversation history to improve context coherence in the generated response.
Given that, we propose a speaker-aware Parallel Hierarchical Attentive
Encoder-Decoder (PHAED) model that aims to model each utterance with the
awareness of its speaker and contextual associations with the same speaker's
previous messages. Specifically, in a conversation involving two speakers, we
regard the utterances from one speaker as responses and those from the other as
queries. After understanding queries via our encoder with inner-query and
inter-query encodings, our decoder reuses the hidden states of previously
generated responses, instead of reconstructing these by the encoder, to
generate a new response. Our empirical results show that PHAED outperforms the
state-of-the-art in both automatic and human evaluations. Furthermore, our
ablation study shows that dialogue models with speaker tokens can generally
decrease the possibility of generating non-coherent responses regarding the

aggregate node representation and the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is
used to extract temporal information. CasSeqGCN predicts the future cascade
size more accurately compared with other state-of-art baseline methods. The
ablation study demonstrates that the improvement mainly comes from the design
of the input and the GCN layer. We explicitly design an experiment to show the
quality of the cascade representation learned by our approach is better than
other methods. Our work proposes a new approach to combine the structural and
temporal features, which not only gives a useful baseline model for future
studies of cascade prediction, but also brings new insights on a wide
collection of problems related with dynamics on and of the network.

developing wireless networks above 100 GHz is given by an accurate performance
evaluation. For simulations, this strongly depends on the accuracy of the
modeling of the channel and of the interaction with the higher layers of the
stack. This paper introduces the implementation of two recently proposed
channel models (based on ray tracing and on a fully stochastic model) for the
140 GHz band for the ns-3 TeraSim module, which enables simulation of macro
wireless networks in the sub-terahertz and terahertz spectrum. We also compare
the two channel models with full-stack simulations in an indoor scenario,

row monomial matrices and the necessary conditions to be closed under the

  The most significant difference between the algebra of row monomial matrices

of row monomial matrices is closed.
  The operation of summation in the algebra can be considered also as an
algebra of subsets of any set. The class of subsets of given set is closed

  The deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can be presented by a complete
underlying graph of the automaton with edges labelled by letters of an
alphabet. Row monomial matrices can be induced by words in the alphabet of
labels on edges of underlying graph of DFA and present a mapping of the set of
states.
  A word $s$ of letters on edges of underlying graph $\Gamma$ of deterministic
finite automaton (DFA) is called synchronizing if $s$ sends all states of the
automaton to a unique state.
  J. \v{C}erny discovered in 1964 a sequence of $n$-state complete DFA
possessing a minimal synchronizing word of length $(n-1)^2$. The hypothesis,
mostly known today as \v{C}erny conjecture, claims that $(n-1)^2$ is a precise
upper bound on the length of such a word over alphabet $\Sigma$ of letters on
edges of $\Gamma$ for every complete $n$-state DFA. The hypothesis was
formulated in 1966 by Starke.
  The following proof of the conjecture uses the algebra of row monomial

studied the variation in the filling factor of overdense structures in the

the synthetic images, we again estimate the filling factors. The estimated
filling factors obtained from both methods are in reasonable agreement. Also,

coronal holes and loops. Our results show that the generation of turbulence
increases the filling factor of the solar corona.

For relatively large lattice constant $d$ and small hopping integral $t$, the

behavior as a function of the interaction strength, and leads to a pair density
wave ground state, where $T_c$ vanishes, for a range of intermediate coupling
strength. In the unitary and BCS regimes, the nature of the in-plane and
overall pairing changes from particle-like to hole-like, with an unexpected
nonmonotonic dependence of the chemical potential on the pairing strength. The

reside above the neutral line between majority-polarity magnetic flux patch and
a merging minority-polarity flux patch, with a flux cancelation rate of
$\sim$10$^{18}$Mx hr$^{-1}$; (iii) some of the campfires occur repeatedly from
the same neutral line; (iv) in the large majority of instances, campfires are
preceded by a cool-plasma structure, analogous to minifilaments in coronal
jets; and (v) although many campfires have `complex' structure, most campfires
resemble small-scale jets, dots, or loops. Thus, `campfire' is a general term
that includes different types of small-scale solar dynamic features. They
contain sufficient magnetic energy ($\sim$10$^{26}$-10$^{27}$ erg) to heat the
solar atmosphere locally to 0.5--2.5MK. Their lifetimes range from about a
minute to over an hour, with most of the campfires having a lifetime of $<$10

Analysis of a disparate collection of large-scale English language corpora --

reinterpretation of the Pollyanna principle's positivity bias for written

the problems with representing observed ousiometric dimensions by bipolar
adjective pairs, we introduce and explore `synousionyms' and `antousionyms' --
ousiometric counterparts of synonyms and antonyms. We further show that the PD
framework revises the circumplex model of affect as a more general model of
state of mind. Finally, we use our findings to construct and test a prototype
`ousiometer', a telegnomic instrument that measures ousiometric time series for

of CL-based techniques, their formulation often relies on heavy-computation

from theoretical and empirical studies, a noticeable negative-positive-coupling

efficiency concerning the batch size. By removing the NPC effect, we propose
decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) loss, which removes the positive term from
the denominator and significantly improves the learning efficiency. DCL
achieves competitive performance with less sensitivity to sub-optimal
hyperparameters, requiring neither large batches in SimCLR, momentum encoding

manifesting robustness as much less sensitive to suboptimal hyperparameters.
Notably, SimCLR with DCL achieves 68.2% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy using batch
size 256 within 200 epochs pre-training, outperforming its SimCLR baseline by
6.4%. Further, DCL can be combined with the SOTA contrastive learning method,
NNCLR, to achieve 72.3% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy with 512 batch size in 400

design an integrated motion model that estimates the motion of the camera and
object in the first and second warping stages, respectively, controlled by the
attention module through a shared motion encoder. Second, we propose an object
motion field estimation through contrastive sample consensus, called CSAC,
taking advantage of weak semantic prior (bounding box from an object detector)
and geometric constraints (each object respects the rigid body motion model).
Experiments on KITTI, Cityscapes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the
relevance of our approach and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms for the tasks of self-supervised monocular depth estimation, object
motion segmentation, monocular scene flow estimation, and visual odometry.

approximations, such as the restriction to certain classes of diagrams in
perturbation theory, that reduce the precision with which magnetic properties
are described. In this work, we examine the description of magnetic properties
in second order perturbation theory, GW, FLEX, and two TMatrix approximations
to numerically exact CT-QMC reference data. We assess finite-size effects and
compare periodic lattice simulations to cluster embedding. We find that
embedding substantially improves finite size convergence. However, by analyzing
different partial summation methods we find no systematic improvement in the
description of magnetic properties, with most methods considered in this work
predicting first-order instead of continuous transitions, leading us to the
conclusion that non-perturbative methods are necessary for the accurate

shifts (MarBLR). We perform empirical evaluation via simulations and a
real-world study predicting COPD risk. We derive ""Type I and II"" regret bounds,
which guarantee the procedures are non-inferior to a static model and
competitive with an oracle logistic reviser in terms of the average loss. Both
procedures consistently outperformed the static model and other online logistic
revision methods. In simulations, the average estimated calibration index
(aECI) of the original model was 0.828 (95%CI 0.818-0.938). Online
recalibration using BLR and MarBLR improved the aECI, attaining 0.265 (95%CI

extensive logistic model revisions, BLR and MarBLR increased the average AUC

the original model with a continually-refitted gradient boosted tree to achieve
aAUCs of 0.924 (95%CI 0.913-0.935) and 0.925 (95%CI 0.914-0.935), compared to
the static model's aAUC of 0.904 (95%CI 0.892-0.916). Despite its simplicity,
BLR is highly competitive with MarBLR. MarBLR outperforms BLR when its prior
better reflects the data. BLR and MarBLR can improve the transportability of
clinical prediction models and maintain their performance over time.

society. In this paper, we propose a population vaccination game framework,
called EPROACH, to design policies for reopenings that guarantee post-opening
public health safety. In our framework, a population of players decides whether
to vaccinate or not based on the public and private information they receive.
The reopening is captured by the switching of the game state. The insights
obtained from our framework include the appropriate vaccination coverage
threshold for safe-reopening and information-based methods to incentivize
individual vaccination decisions. In particular, our framework bridges the
modeling of the strategic behaviors of the populations and the spreading of
infectious diseases. This integration enables finding the threshold which
guarantees a disease-free epidemic steady state under the population's Nash
equilibrium vaccination decisions. The equilibrium vaccination decisions depend
on the information received by the agents. It makes the steady-state epidemic
severity controllable through information. We find out that the externalities
created by reopening lead to the coordination of the rational players in the
population and result in a unique Nash equilibrium. We use numerical
experiments to corroborate the results and illustrate the design of public
information for responsible reopening.

the axons and dendrites of neurons plays a crucial role in normal cell
function. Moreover, stimulus-dependent regulation of active transport is an
important component of long-term synaptic plasticity, whereas the disruption of
vesicular transport can lead to the onset of various neurodegenerative
diseases. In this paper we investigate how the discrete and stochastic nature
of vesicular transport in axons contributes to fluctuations in the accumulation
of resources within synaptic targets. We begin by solving the first passage
time problem of a single motor-cargo complex (particle) searching for synaptic
targets distributed along a one-dimensional axonal cable. We then use queuing
theory
  to analyze the accumulation of synaptic resources under the combined effects
of multiple search-and-capture events and degradation. In particular, we
determine the steady-state mean and variance of the distribution of synaptic
resources along the axon in response to the periodic insertion of particles.
The mean distribution recovers the spatially decaying distribution of resources
familiar from deterministic population models. However, the discrete nature of
vesicular transport can lead to Fano factors that are greater than unity
(non-Poissonian) across the array of synapses, resulting in significant
fluctuation bursts. We also find that each synaptic Fano factor is independent
of the rate of particle insertion but increases monotonically with the amount
of protein cargo in each vesicle. This implies that fluctuations can be reduced
by increasing the injection rate while decreasing the cargo load of each
vesicle.

performed a series of ab initio simulations on carbon in order to match the
density-stress measurements of Smith et al. [Smith, et al., Nature 511, 330

carbon in the diamond and BC8 phases, with and without defects, as well as

an initially uniaxially compressed cell transforming isochorically into an
isotropically (hydrostatic equivalent) compressed state having lower internal
energy, hence higher temperature so as to conserve energy. Multiple such
heating events can occur during a single ramp experiment, leading to higher
temperatures than with isentropic compression. Comparison with experiments
shows that heating alone does not explain the equation of state measurements on
diamond, instead implying that a significant uniaxial stress component remains
present at high compression. The temperature predictions of our ramp
compression model remain to be verified with future laboratory measurements.

the defining power or are not interesting enough to social media app users.
Another reason is that the intricacy of natural language allows the use of
tense, negation and grammar to change the logic or emphasis of language, thus
conveying completely different meanings. In this paper, we present TAG, a
high-quality concept matching dataset consisting of 10,000 labeled pairs of

expensive re-training on all of the candidate models/tasks pairs. In this

the poor performance of H-score -- a common baseline for newer metrics -- and
propose shrinkage-based estimator. This results in up to 80% absolute gain in
H-score correlation performance, making it competitive with the
state-of-the-art LogME measure. Our shrinkage-based H-score is
$3\times$-10$\times$ faster to compute compared to LogME. Additionally, we look
into a less common setting of target (as opposed to source) task selection. We
demonstrate previously overlooked problems in such settings with different

NCE, LEEP that resulted in them being misrepresented as leading measures. We
propose a correction and recommend measuring correlation performance against

task, collected an AVSD dataset, developed AVSD technologies, and hosted an
AVSD challenge track at both the 7th and 8th Dialog System Technology
Challenges (DSTC7, DSTC8). In these challenges, the best-performing systems
relied heavily on human-generated descriptions of the video content, which were
available in the datasets but would be unavailable in real-world applications.
To promote further advancements for real-world applications, we proposed a
third AVSD challenge, at DSTC10, with two modifications: 1) the human-created
description is unavailable at inference time, and 2) systems must demonstrate
temporal reasoning by finding evidence from the video to support each answer.
This paper introduces the new task that includes temporal reasoning and our new
extension of the AVSD dataset for DSTC10, for which we collected
human-generated temporal reasoning data. We also introduce a baseline system
built using an AV-transformer, which we released along with the new dataset.
Finally, this paper introduces a new system that extends our baseline system
with attentional multimodal fusion, joint student-teacher learning (JSTL), and
model combination techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performances on the
AVSD datasets for DSTC7, DSTC8, and DSTC10. We also propose two temporal
reasoning methods for AVSD: one attention-based, and one based on a time-domain
region proposal network.

bounded domain $\calU\subset \R^d$ for $d=2,3$. The domain is perforated by a
set of partially absorbing targets within which the particle may be absorbed at
a rate $\kappa$. Each target is assumed to be much smaller than $|\calU|$,
which allows us to use asymptotic and Green's function methods to solve the
diffusion equation in Laplace space. In particular, we construct an inner
solution within the interior and local exterior of each target, and match it
with an outer solution in the bulk of $\calU$. This yields an asymptotic
expansion of the Laplace transformed flux into each target in powers of
$\nu=-1/\ln \epsilon$ ($d=2$) and $\epsilon$ ($d=3$), respectively, where
$\epsilon$ is the non-dimensionalized target size. The fluxes determine how the
mean first-passage time to absorption depends on the reaction rate $\kappa$ and
the resetting rate $r$. For a range of parameter values, the MFPT is a unimodal
function of $r$, with a minimum at an optimal resetting rate $r_{\rm opt}$ that
depends on $\kappa$ and the target configuration.

upper and lower bounds for both methods, which improves upon concurrently
developed upper bounds for this problem via a fast rate generalization bound.
We discover that the current Deep Ritz Methods is sub-optimal and propose a
modified version of it. We also prove that PINN and the modified version of DRM
can achieve minimax optimal bounds over Sobolev spaces. Empirically, following
recent work which has shown that the deep model accuracy will improve with
growing training sets according to a power law, we supply computational
experiments to show a similar behavior of dimension dependent power law for
deep PDE solvers.

mesons. Specifically, we focus on hadronic decay and scattering processes,
which are dominated by effects of the strong interaction in the low-energy
regime. A peculiarity of the strong interaction is that perturbative expansions
fail at hadronic energy scales. Thus, genuine nonperturbative tools are
essential to obtain first-principles predictions. Here we use Lattice Field
Theory, and Effective Field Theories. The mathematical formulation of Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) and the methods to resolve its dynamics will be addressed
in Chapter 1. The research of this dissertation is divided in two parts.
Chapter 2 describes our study of the 't Hooft limit of QCD using lattice
simulations, while in Chapter 3 we consider processes that involve
multiparticle states. The 't Hooft limit provides a simplification of
nonabelian gauge theories that leads to nonperturbative predictions. We will
analyze the scaling with the number of colours of various observables, such as
meson masses, decay constants and weak matrix elements. A question we address
is the origin of the long-standing puzzle of the $\Delta I=1/2$ rule, that is,
the large hierarchy in the isospin amplitudes of the $K \to \pi\pi$ weak decay.
Regarding multiparticle processes, we will discuss generalizations of the
L\""uscher formalism to explore three-particle processes from lattice
simulations. The focus will be on our contributions, such as our implementation
of the finite-volume formalism that includes higher partial waves, and the
first application of the formalism to a full lattice QCD spectrum. We will also
comment on the extension of the approach to generic three-pion systems. A
summary in Spanish will be given in Chapter 4. The final part of the thesis

to a desirable value function, it is well-known that ETD often encounters a
large variance so that its sample complexity can increase exponentially fast
with the number of iterations. In this work, we propose a new ETD method,
called PER-ETD (i.e., PEriodically Restarted-ETD), which restarts and updates
the follow-on trace only for a finite period for each iteration of the
evaluation parameter. Further, PER-ETD features a design of the logarithmical
increase of the restart period with the number of iterations, which guarantees
the best trade-off between the variance and bias and keeps both vanishing
sublinearly. We show that PER-ETD converges to the same desirable fixed point
as ETD, but improves the exponential sample complexity of ETD to be
polynomials. Our experiments validate the superior performance of PER-ETD and
its advantage over ETD.

the physical world. How should an intelligent agent go about learning such
models? In this paper, we will study if models of the world learned in an
open-ended physics environment, without any specific tasks, can be reused for
downstream physics reasoning tasks. To this end, we build a benchmark
Open-ended Physics ENvironment (OPEn) and also design several tasks to test
learning representations in this environment explicitly. This setting reflects
the conditions in which real agents (i.e. rolling robots) find themselves,
where they may be placed in a new kind of environment and must adapt without
any teacher to tell them how this environment works. This setting is
challenging because it requires solving an exploration problem in addition to a
model building and representation learning problem. We test several existing
RL-based exploration methods on this benchmark and find that an agent using
unsupervised contrastive learning for representation learning, and
impact-driven learning for exploration, achieved the best results. However, all
models still fall short in sample efficiency when transferring to the
downstream tasks. We expect that OPEn will encourage the development of novel
rolling robot agents that can build reusable mental models of the world that
facilitate many tasks.

of the key challenges in deep learning, especially for overparametrized models,
where the local minimizers of the loss function $L$ can form a manifold.
Intuitively, with a sufficiently small learning rate $\eta$, SGD tracks
Gradient Descent (GD) until it gets close to such manifold, where the gradient
noise prevents further convergence. In such a regime, Blanc et al. (2020)
proved that SGD with label noise locally decreases a regularizer-like term, the
sharpness of loss, $\mathrm{tr}[\nabla^2 L]$. The current paper gives a general
framework for such analysis by adapting ideas from Katzenberger (1991). It
allows in principle a complete characterization for the regularization effect
of SGD around such manifold -- i.e., the ""implicit bias"" -- using a stochastic
differential equation (SDE) describing the limiting dynamics of the parameters,
which is determined jointly by the loss function and the noise covariance. This
yields some new results: (1) a global analysis of the implicit bias valid for
$\eta^{-2}$ steps, in contrast to the local analysis of Blanc et al. (2020)
that is only valid for $\eta^{-1.6}$ steps and (2) allowing arbitrary noise
covariance. As an application, we show with arbitrary large initialization,
label noise SGD can always escape the kernel regime and only requires
$O(\kappa\ln d)$ samples for learning an $\kappa$-sparse overparametrized
linear model in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (Woodworth et al., 2020), while GD initialized
in the kernel regime requires $\Omega(d)$ samples. This upper bound is minimax
optimal and improves the previous $\tilde{O}(\kappa^2)$ upper bound (HaoChen et
al., 2020).

\emph{object-centric} approach that extends video transformer layers with a

fuse object-centric representations starting from early layers and propagate
them into the transformer-layers, thus affecting the spatio-temporal

object-level streams: appearance and dynamics. In the appearance stream, an
""Object-Region Attention"" module applies self-attention over the patches and
\emph{object regions}. In this way, visual object regions interact with uniform
patch tokens and enrich them with contextualized object information. We further
model object dynamics via a separate ""Object-Dynamics Module"", which captures
trajectory interactions, and show how to integrate the two streams. We evaluate
our model on four tasks and five datasets: compositional and few-shot action
recognition on SomethingElse, spatio-temporal action detection on AVA, and
standard action recognition on Something-Something V2, Diving48 and

given data of its state over time has challenged scientists for decades. In
this paper, the approach of using machine learning to model the {\em updates}
of the phase space variables is introduced; this is done as a function of the
phase space variables. (More generally, the modeling is done over the jet space
of the variables.) This approach is shown to accurately replicate the dynamics
for the examples of the harmonic oscillator, the pendulum, and the Duffing
oscillator; the underlying differential equation is also accurately recovered
in each example. In addition, the results in no way depend on how the data is
sampled over time (i.e., regularly or irregularly). It is demonstrated that
this approach (named ""FJet"") is similar to the model resulting from a Taylor
series expansion of the Runge-Kutta (RK) numerical integration scheme. This
analogy confers the advantage of explicitly revealing the appropriate functions
to use in the modeling, as well as revealing the error estimate of the updates.
Thus, this new approach can be thought of as a way to determine the
coefficients of an RK scheme by machine learning. Finally, it is shown in the
undamped harmonic oscillator example that the stability of the updates is
stable for $10^9$ times longer than with $4$th-order RK.

This top-down approach outperforms its bottom-up counterpart in which object
bounding box prediction follows per-pixel depth estimation, since it does not

new result is an improvement over that of [14] in two important respects.
First, the axiomatization of frames in [14] was rather cumbersome and it is now
simplified, partly by incorporating Gehrke's proposal [8] of section stability
for relations. Second, morphisms are redefined so as to preserve Galois stable
(and co-stable) sets and we rely for this, partly again, on Goldblatt's [11]
recently proposed definition of bounded morphisms for polarities, though we
need to strengthen the definition in order to get a Stone duality result.
  In studying the dual algebraic structures associated to polarities with
relations we demonstrate that stable/co-stable set operators result as the
Galois closure of the restriction of classical (though sorted) image operators
generated by the frame relations to Galois stable/co-stable sets. This provides
a proof, at the representation level, that non-distributive logics can be

numerical simulations, we study the impact that the large optical depth has on
various signal statistics. We observe that the variance, skewness and kurtosis,
calculated at simulation resolution ($\sim 0.5 h^{-1} \, {\rm Mpc}$), are

redshifts, with 77$\pm$11% of sources at $z>3$ and 38$\pm$12% of sources at

the highest redshift dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Lower redshift DSFGs
($z<3$) are far more numerous than those at $z>3$ yet likely to drop out at

robustly differentiate smooth emission, as expected for a dark matter origin,
from more ""clumpy"" emission expected for a population of relatively bright,
unresolved point sources. We use recent advancements in the field of
simulation-based inference, in particular density estimation techniques using
normalizing flows, in order to characterize the contribution of modeled
components, including unresolved point source populations, to the GCE. Compared
to traditional techniques based on the statistical distribution of photon
counts, our machine learning-based method is able to utilize more of the
information contained in a given model of the Galactic Center emission, and in
particular can perform posterior parameter estimation while accounting for
pixel-to-pixel spatial correlations in the gamma-ray map. This makes the method
demonstrably more resilient to certain forms of model misspecification. On
application to Fermi data, the method generically attributes a smaller fraction
of the GCE flux to unresolved point sources when compared to traditional
approaches. We nevertheless infer such a contribution to make up a
non-negligible fraction of the GCE across all analysis variations considered,
with at least $38^{+9}_{-19}\%$ of the excess attributed to unresolved point
sources in our baseline analysis.

larger Hilbert spaces are established in mathematics, they have been so far
less explored beyond the two-level case for practical usage in condensed matter
settings, or have involved restrictions to sub manifolds within the full
Hilbert space. We here employ a coherence vector description to theoretically
characterize a general N-level system on the higher dimensional generalized
Bloch (hyper)sphere by respecting the structure of the underlying SU(N) algebra
and construct physically intuitive geometric pictures for topological concepts.
Focusing on two spatial dimensions, we reveal a geometric interpretation for
the Chern number in larger Hilbert spaces in terms of a nested structure
comprising N-1 two-spheres. We demonstrate that for the N-level case, there is
an exterior two-sphere that provides a useful characterization of the system,
notably by playing a primary role in determining the Chern number. The external
sphere can be directly measured in ultracold atoms via well-established band
mapping techniques, thereby imparting knowledge of the topological nature of
state. We also investigate how the time evolution of the coherence vector
defined on the generalized Bloch hypersphere can be utilized to extract the
full state vector in experiments, allowing us to develop a tomography scheme
involving quenches for three-level systems. Our geometric description opens up
a new avenue for the interpretation of the topological classification and the
dynamical illustration of multi-level systems, which in turn is anticipated to

$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}\gtrsim1$ AGN at $0.4\leq z \leq 0.75$, observed with
XMM-Newton. Optical/UV data from simultaneous Optical Monitor observations have
been also considered. These AGN have been selected to have relatively high
values of black hole mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}\sim10^{8-8.5}M_\odot$) and bolometric
luminosity ($L_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), in order to complement
previous studies of high-Eddington AGN at lower $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and
$L_\mathrm{bol}$. We studied the relation between $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ and
other key X-ray spectral parameters, such as the photon index of the power-law
continuum $\Gamma$, the X-ray bolometric correction $k_\mathrm{bol,X}$ and
$\alpha_\mathrm{ox}$. Despite the homogeneous optical and SMBH accretion
properties, the X-ray properties of these high-Eddington AGN are quite
heterogeneous. We measured values of $\Gamma$ comprised between 1.3 and 2.5, at
odds with the expectations based on previously reported
$\Gamma-\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ relations, by which $\Gamma\geq2$ would be an
ubiquitous hallmark of AGN with $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}\sim1$. We found that
$\sim30\%$ of the sources are X-ray weak, with an X-ray emission about a factor
of $\sim10-80$ fainter than that of typical AGN at similar UV luminosities. The
X-ray weakness seems to be intrinsic and not due to intervening obscuration.
This may indicate that high-Eddington AGN commonly undergo periods of intrinsic
X-ray weakness. Furthermore, results from a follow-up monitoring with Swift of
one of these X-ray weak AGN suggest that these periods can last for several
years.

infinite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces which must be truncated to perform
simulations of real-time dynamics on classical or quantum computers. To analyze
the truncation error, we develop methods for bounding the rate of growth of
local quantum numbers such as the occupation number of a mode at a lattice
site, or the electric field at a lattice link. Our approach applies to various
models of bosons interacting with spins or fermions, and also to both abelian
and non-abelian gauge theories. We show that if states in these models are
truncated by imposing an upper limit $\Lambda$ on each local quantum number,
and if the initial state has low local quantum numbers, then an error at most
$\epsilon$ can be achieved by choosing $\Lambda$ to scale polylogarithmically
with $\epsilon^{-1}$, an exponential improvement over previous bounds based on
energy conservation. For the Hubbard-Holstein model, we numerically compute a
bound on $\Lambda$ that achieves accuracy $\epsilon$, obtaining significantly
improved estimates in various parameter regimes. We also establish a criterion
for truncating the Hamiltonian with a provable guarantee on the accuracy of
time evolution. Building on that result, we formulate quantum algorithms for
dynamical simulation of lattice gauge theories and of models with bosonic
modes; the gate complexity depends almost linearly on spacetime volume in the
former case, and almost quadratically on time in the latter case. We establish
a lower bound showing that there are systems involving bosons for which this
quadratic scaling with time cannot be improved. By applying our result on the
truncation error in time evolution, we also prove that spectrally isolated
energy eigenstates can be approximated with accuracy $\epsilon$ by truncating

metal-loading factor. The resulting model reproduces very well the local
mass-metallicity relation, and the observed trends of metallicity with gas
fraction. Although the difference in mass loading between accreted and expelled
gas is extremely difficult to constrain, we find indications that, on average,
the amount of gas acquired through accretion is roughly the same as the gas
lost through bulk stellar outflows, corresponding to a ""gas equilibrium""
scenario. In agreement with previous work, the wind metal-loading factor shows
a steep increase toward lower mass and circular velocity, indicating that
low-mass galaxies are more efficient at expelling metals, thus shaping the
mass-metallicity relation. Effective yields are found to increase with mass up
to an inflection mass threshold, with a mild decline at larger masses and
circular velocities. A comparison of our results for metal loading in outflows
with the expectations for their mass loading favors momentum-driven winds at
low masses, rather than energy-driven ones. (abridged)

Release 4 (KiDS-1000), using a new pseudo angular power spectrum estimator
(pseudo-$C_{\ell}$) under development for the ESA Euclid mission. Over 21
million galaxies with shape information are divided into five tomographic
redshift bins, ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 in photometric redshift. We measured
pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ using eight bands in the multipole range $76<\ell<1500$ for
auto- and cross-power spectra between the tomographic bins. A series of tests
were carried out to check for systematic contamination from a variety of
observational sources including stellar number density, variations in survey
depth, and point spread function properties. While some marginal correlations
with these systematic tracers were observed, there is no evidence of bias in
the cosmological inference. B-mode power spectra are consistent with zero
signal, with no significant residual contamination from E/B-mode leakage. We
performed a Bayesian analysis of the pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ estimates by forward
modelling the effects of the mask. Assuming a spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology, we constrained the structure growth parameter $S_8 =
\sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{1/2} = 0.754_{-0.029}^{+0.027}$. When combining
cosmic shear from KiDS-1000 with baryon acoustic oscillation and redshift space
distortion data from recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) measurements of
luminous red galaxies, as well as the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and its
cross-correlation with quasars, we tightened these constraints to $S_8 =
0.771^{+0.006}_{-0.032}$. These results are in very good agreement with
previous KiDS-1000 and SDSS analyses and confirm a $\sim 3\sigma$ tension with
early-Universe constraints from cosmic microwave background experiments.

particular event is uncharacteristic of a given background distribution. One
way to define a score is to use autoencoders, which rely on the ability to
reconstruct certain types of data (background) but not others (signals). In
this paper, we study some challenges associated with variational autoencoders,
such as the dependence on hyperparameters and the metric used, in the context
of anomalous signal (top and $W$) jets in a QCD background. We find that the
hyperparameter choices strongly affect the network performance and that the
optimal parameters for one signal are non-optimal for another. In exploring the
networks, we uncover a connection between the latent space of a variational
autoencoder trained using mean-squared-error and the optimal transport
distances within the dataset. We then show that optimal transport distances to
representative events in the background dataset can be used directly for
anomaly detection, with performance comparable to the autoencoders. Whether
using autoencoders or optimal transport distances for anomaly detection, we
find that the choices that best represent the background are not necessarily
best for signal identification. These challenges with unsupervised anomaly
detection bolster the case for additional exploration of semi-supervised or
alternative approaches.

metallicities of the streams and the mass-metallicity relation, the
luminosities of the progenitors of the DG streams range between Carina and Ursa
Major I ($-9.5\lesssim M_V\lesssim-5.5$). Four of the six GC streams have mean
metallicities of [Fe/H]$< -2$, more metal-poor than typical Milky Way (MW) GCs

streams on retrograde orbits in our dozen stream sample. Finally, we compare
the orbital properties of the streams with known DGs and GCs in the MW, finding
several possible associations. Some streams appear to have been accreted with
the recently discovered Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage system, and others suggest that

dust-to-metals/DTM ratio) tends to increase with metallicity. This can be
explained by the increasing efficiency of grain growth in the interstellar
medium (ISM) at higher metallicities, with a corollary being that the low DTM
ratios seen at low metallicities are due to inefficient stellar dust
production. This interpretation assumes that the efficiency of dust destruction
in the ISM is constant, whereas it might be expected to increase at low
metallicity; the decreased cooling efficiency of low-metallicity gas should
result in more post-shock dust destruction via thermal sputtering. We show that
incorporating a sufficiently strong metallicity dependence into models of
galaxy evolution removes the need for low stellar dust yields. The contribution
of stellar sources to the overall dust budget may be significantly
underestimated, and that of grain growth overestimated, by models assuming a

means of so-called quantum instruments capturing both classical outputs and

characterize quantum instruments alongside its experimental implementation and
analysis. Thereby, the full dynamics of a quantum instrument can be captured,
exhibiting details of the quantum dynamics that would be overlooked with common

technique to a quantum instrument used for the detection of qubit loss and
leakage, which was recently implemented as a building block in a quantum error

unexpected and in-depth information about the failure modes of the

implications of these experimental failure modes on QEC performance, when the
instrument is employed as a building block in QEC protocols on a logical qubit.
Our results highlight the importance of careful characterization and modelling

Reconstructing the 3D intrinsic density distribution of a galaxy from the 2D
image is challenging, especially for barred galaxies, but is a critical step
for constructing galactic dynamical models. Here we present a method for
deprojecting barred galaxies and we validate the method by testing against mock
images created from an N-body simulation with a peanut-shaped bar. We decompose
a galaxy image into a bulge (including a bar) and a disk. By subtracting the
disk from the original image a barred bulge remains. We perform multi-Gaussian
expansion (MGE) fit to each component, then we deproject them separately by
considering the barred bulge is triaxial while the disk is axisymmetric. We
restrict the barred bulge to be aligned in the disk plane and has a similar
thickness to the disk in the outer regions. The 3D density distribution is thus
constructed by combining the barred bulge and the disk. Our model can generally
recover the 3D density distribution of disk and inner barred bulge regions,
although not a perfect match to the peanut-shaped structure. By using the same
initial conditions, we integrate the orbits in our model-inferred potential and
the true potential by freezing the N-body simulation. We find that 85% of all
these orbits have similar morphologies in these two potentials, and our model
supports the orbits that generate a boxy/peanut-shaped structure and an
elongated bar similar to these in the true potential.

long-standing ill-posed topic. Such challenge stems mainly from the diverse
subjective opinions of different observers about the varied types of content.
There is a growing interest in estimating the user agreement by considering the
standard deviation of the scores, instead of only predicting the mean aesthetic
opinion score. Nevertheless, when comparing a pair of contents, few studies
consider how confident are we regarding the difference in the aesthetic scores.
In this paper, we thus propose (1) a re-adapted multi-task attention network to
predict both the mean opinion score and the standard deviation in an end-to-end
manner; (2) a brand-new confidence interval ranking loss that encourages the
model to focus on image-pairs that are less certain about the difference of
their aesthetic scores. With such loss, the model is encouraged to learn the
uncertainty of the content that is relevant to the diversity of observers'
opinions, i.e., user disagreement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that
the proposed multi-task aesthetic model achieves state-of-the-art performance

commonly used to diagnose gas properties in the interstellar medium but are
significantly sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionization rate. The carbon-cycle
chemistry is known to be quite sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionization rate,
$\zeta$, controlled by the flux of low-energy cosmic rays which get attenuated
through molecular clouds. However, astrochemical models commonly assume a
constant cosmic-ray ionization rate in the clouds. We investigate the effect of
cosmic-ray attenuation on the emission of carbon cycle species from molecular
clouds, in particular the [CII] 158 $\mu$m, [CI] 609 $\mu$m and CO (J = 1 - 0)
115.27 GHz lines. We use a post-processed chemical model of diffuse and dense
simulated molecular clouds and quantify the variation in both column densities
and velocity integrated line emission of the carbon cycle with different
cosmic-ray ionization rate models. We find that the abundances and column
densities of carbon cycle species is significantly impacted by the chosen
cosmic-ray ionization rate model: no single constant ionization rate can
reproduce the abundances modelled with an attenuated cosmic-ray model. Further,
we show that constant ionization rate models fail to simultaneously reproduce
the integrated emission of the lines we consider, and their deviations from a
physically derived cosmic-ray attenuation model is too complex to be simply
corrected. We demonstrate that the two clouds we model exhibit a similar
average $A_{\rm V, eff}$ -- $n_{\rm H}$ relationship, resulting in an average
relation between the cosmic-ray ionization rate and density $\zeta(n_{\rm H})$.
We conclude by providing a number of implementation recommendations for CRs in
astrochemical models, but emphasize the necessity for column-dependent
cosmic-ray ionization rate prescriptions.

domain, resulting in a surge of new information. As with other emergent
domains, the discussion surrounding the topic has been rapidly changing,
leading to the spread of misinformation. This has created the need for a public
space for users to ask questions and receive credible, scientific answers. To
fulfill this need, we turn to the task of open-domain question-answering, which
we can use to efficiently find answers to free-text questions from a large set
of documents. In this work, we present such a system for the emergent domain of
COVID-19. Despite the small data size available, we are able to successfully
train the system to retrieve answers from a large-scale corpus of published
COVID-19 scientific papers. Furthermore, we incorporate effective re-ranking
and question-answering techniques, such as document diversity and multiple
answer spans. Our open-domain question-answering system can further act as a
model for the quick development of similar systems that can be adapted and
modified for other developing emergent domains.

then the entanglement between them can undergo a phase transition and become
nonzero at a finite critical time $t_c$. The fidelity of teleporting a quantum
state from an input qubit to an infinitely distant output qubit shows the same
critical onset. Specifically, these finite time transitions occur in
short-range interacting two-dimensional random unitary circuits and in
sufficiently long-range interacting one-dimensional circuits. The phase
transition is understood by mapping the random continuous-time evolution to a
finite temperature thermal state of an effective spin Hamiltonian, where the
inverse temperature equals the evolution time in the circuit. In this
framework, the entanglement between two distant qubits at times $t>t_c$
corresponds to the emergence of long-range ferromagnetic spin correlations
below the critical temperature. We verify these predictions using numerical

attracted attention as a platform for building quantum devices capable of
performing tasks that are out of reach for classical devices. There is
therefore significant interest, from the perspective of computational
complexity theory, in solidifying the mathematical foundation for the hardness
of simulating these devices. We show that, under the standard
Anti-Concentration and Permanent-of-Gaussians conjectures, there is no
efficient classical algorithm to sample from ideal Gaussian boson sampling
distributions (even approximately) unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.
The hardness proof holds in the regime where the number of modes scales
quadratically with the number of photons, a setting in which hardness was
widely believed to hold but that nevertheless had no definitive proof.
  Crucial to the proof is a new method for programming a Gaussian boson
sampling device so that the output probabilities are proportional to the
permanents of submatrices of an arbitrary matrix. This technique is a
generalization of Scattershot BosonSampling that we call BipartiteGBS. We also
make progress towards the goal of proving hardness in the regime where there
are fewer than quadratically more modes than photons (i.e., the high-collision
regime) by showing that the ability to approximate permanents of matrices with
repeated rows/columns confers the ability to approximate permanents of matrices
with no repetitions. The reduction suffices to prove that GBS is hard in the
constant-collision regime.

demonstrate a validation of our analysis pipeline using the mock catalogs of

the first billion years. Exploring four models of radiative feedback, we fit
the SFH of each galaxy at $z>5$ as $\mathrm{log}(\mathrm{SFR}(z))=-\alpha(1 +
z)+\beta$; star formation is deemed stochastic if it deviates from this fit by
more than $\Delta_\mathrm{SFR}=0.6\,$dex. Our key findings are: (i) The
fraction of stellar mass formed and time spent in the stochastic phase decrease
with increasing stellar mass and redshift $z$. While galaxies with stellar
masses of $M_\star\sim10^7M_\odot$ at $z\sim5~(10)$ form $\sim70\%~(20\%)$ of
their stellar mass in the stochastic phase, this reduces to $<10\%$ at all
redshifts for galaxies with $M_\star > 10^{10}M_\odot$; (ii) the fractional
mass assembled and lifetime spent in the stochastic phase do not significantly
change with the radiative feedback model used; (iii) at all redshifts, $\alpha$
increases (decreases for the strongest radiative feedback model) with stellar
mass for galaxies with $M_\star\lesssim 10^{8.5}M_\odot$ and converges to
$\sim0.18$ for more massive galaxies; $\beta$ always increases with stellar
mass. Our proposed fits can reliably recover the stellar masses and
mass-to-light ratios for galaxies with $M_\star\sim10^{8-10.5}M_\odot$ and
$M_{UV}\sim-17~{\rm to}~-23$ at $z\sim 5-9$. This physical model can therefore
be used to derive the SFHs for galaxies observed by a number of forthcoming
instruments.

Motivated by this observation, we tackle the initialization problem for

propose a guided policy search method that has two key components: i)
Trajectory update; ii) Policy update. The trajectory update involves offline
solutions of a large number of trajectory optimization problems from different
initial states via Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). Here we take a single
SCP step to generate the trajectory iterate for each problem. In conjunction
with these iterates, we also generate additional trajectories around each
iterate via a feedback control law. Then all these trajectories are used by a
stochastic gradient descent algorithm to update the neural network policy,
i.e., the policy update step. As a result, the trained policy makes it possible
to generate trajectory candidates that are close to the optimality and
feasibility and that provide excellent initial guesses for the trajectory
optimization methods. We validate the proposed method via a real-world
6-degree-of-freedom powered descent guidance problem for a reusable rocket.

enabler for next-generation vehicles with enhanced safety, efficiency, and
comfort. However, existing road information discovery approaches have been
predominately performed in a single-vehicle setting, which is inevitably
susceptible to vehicle model uncertainty and measurement errors. To overcome
these limitations, this paper presents a novel cloud-assisted collaborative
estimation framework that can utilize multiple heterogeneous vehicles to
iteratively enhance estimation performance. Specifically, each vehicle combines
its onboard measurements with a cloud-based Gaussian process (GP), crowdsourced
from prior participating vehicles as ""pseudo-measurements"", into a local
estimator to refine the estimation. The resultant local onboard estimation is
then sent back to the cloud to update the GP, where we utilize a noisy input GP
(NIGP) method to explicitly handle uncertain GPS measurements. We employ the
proposed framework to the application of collaborative road profile estimation.
Promising results on extensive simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments
show that the proposed collaborative estimation can significantly enhance

expensive function evaluations (also referred to as experiments), where the
goal is to approximate the true Pareto set of solutions by minimizing the total
resource cost of experiments. For example, in hardware design optimization, we
need to find the designs that trade-off performance, energy, and area overhead
using expensive computational simulations. The key challenge is to select the
sequence of experiments to uncover high-quality solutions using minimal
resources. In this paper, we propose a general framework for solving MOO
problems based on the principle of output space entropy (OSE) search: select
the experiment that maximizes the information gained per unit resource cost
about the true Pareto front. We appropriately instantiate the principle of OSE
search to derive efficient algorithms for the following four MOO problem
settings: 1) The most basic em single-fidelity setting, where experiments are
expensive and accurate; 2) Handling em black-box constraints} which cannot be
evaluated without performing experiments; 3) The discrete multi-fidelity
setting, where experiments can vary in the amount of resources consumed and
their evaluation accuracy; and 4) The em continuous-fidelity setting, where
continuous function approximations result in a huge space of experiments.
Experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that our OSE
search based algorithms improve over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both
computational-efficiency and accuracy of MOO solutions.

Originally implemented in Java as a proof of concept, it did not scale well,

  Encountered-Type Haptic Display",,,,,"cs.RO cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Rendering stable hard surfaces is an important problem in haptics for many
tasks, including training simulators for orthopedic surgery or dentistry.
Current impedance devices cannot provide enough force and stiffness to render a
wall, and the high friction and inertia of admittance devices make it difficult
to render free space. We propose to address these limitations by combining
haptic augmented reality, untethered haptic interaction, and an
encountered-type haptic display. We attach a plate with the desired hardness on
the kinesthetic device's end-effector, which the user interacts with using an
untethered stylus. This method allows us to directly change the hardness of the
end-effector based on the rendered object. In this paper, we evaluate how
changing the hardness of the end-effector can mask the device's stiffness and
affect the user's perception. The results of our human subject experiment
indicate that when the end-effector is made of a hard material, it is difficult
for users to perceive when the underlying stiffness being rendered by the
device is changed, but this stiffness change is easy to distinguish while the
end-effector is made of a soft material. These results show promise for our
approach in avoiding the limitations of haptic devices when rendering hard
surfaces.

recognition model that assigns a multitude of distinct images to the concept of
""cat"" to the time series forecasting model which assigns a range of distinct
time-series to a single scalar regression value. While the primary use of such
models is naturally to associate correct output to each input, in many problems
it is also useful to be able to explore, understand, and sample from a model's
fibers, which are the set of input values $x$ such that $f(x) = y$, for fixed
$y$ in the output space. In this paper we show that popular generative
architectures are ill-suited to such tasks. Motivated by this we introduce a
novel generative architecture, a Bundle Network, based on the concept of a
fiber bundle from (differential) topology. BundleNets exploit the idea of a
local trivialization wherein a space can be locally decomposed into a product
space that cleanly encodes the many-to-one nature of the map. By enforcing this
decomposition in BundleNets and by utilizing state-of-the-art invertible
components, investigating a network's fibers becomes natural.

performance on previously seen classes. Our findings shed new light on the

star formation, based chiefly on 729~ks Chandra observations. Our main findings
are 1) the X-ray emission is enhanced not only along the galaxy's grand spiral
arms, but also clearly in their downstreams; 2) the spectrum of the emission
can be well characterized by a super-solar metallicity plasma with a lognormal
temperature distribution, plus an X-ray absorption of a lognormal column
density distribution; 3) the intensity of the emission is strongly
anti-correlated with the dust obscuration seen in optical images of the galaxy.
These findings suggest A) the morphology of the X-ray emission is likely due to
the convolution of the feedback heating of the plasma with its thermal and
dynamical evolution; B) the X-ray emission, accounting for ~10% of the feedback
energy input rate, probably traces only the high-energy tail of the radiation
from the plasma; C) a good fraction of the recent star forming regions seems
sufficiently energetic to produce multi-phased outflows, likely responsible for
much of the dust obscuration and X-ray absorption. Direct confrontation of the

Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) signals as dependent variables, and then using
machine learning algorithms to develop a blood pressure estimation model based
on these data. The greatest challenge of this field is the insufficient

method involves extracting Pulse Transit Time (PTT), PPG Intensity Ratio (PIR),

Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals as the inputs of clustering and regression,
extracting Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)

The method was implemented using the MIMICII dataset with the silhouette
criterion used to determine the optimal number of clusters. The results showed
that because of the inconsistency, high dispersion, and multi-trend behavior of
the extracted features vectors, the accuracy can be significantly improved by
running a clustering algorithm and then developing a regression model on each
cluster, and finally weighted averaging of the results based on the error of
each cluster. When implemented with 5 clusters and GBR, this approach yielded
an MAE of 2.56 for SBP estimates and 2.23 for DBP estimates, which were
significantly better than the best results without clustering (DBP: 6.27, SBP:

learning. However, due to the nested structure of bilevel optimization, even
gradient-based methods require second-order derivative approximations via
Jacobian- or/and Hessian-vector computations, which can be costly and
unscalable in practice. Recently, Hessian-free bilevel schemes have been
proposed to resolve this issue, where the general idea is to use zeroth- or
first-order methods to approximate the full hypergradient of the bilevel
problem. However, we empirically observe that such approximation can lead to
large variance and unstable training, but estimating only the response Jacobian
matrix as a partial component of the hypergradient turns out to be extremely
effective. To this end, we propose a new Hessian-free method, which adopts the
zeroth-order-like method to approximate the response Jacobian matrix via taking
difference between two optimization paths. Theoretically, we provide the
convergence rate analysis for the proposed algorithms, where our key challenge
is to characterize the approximation and smoothness properties of the
trajectory-dependent estimator, which can be of independent interest. This is
the first known convergence rate result for this type of Hessian-free bilevel
algorithms. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms
outperform baseline bilevel optimizers on various bilevel problems.
Particularly, in our experiment on few-shot meta-learning with ResNet-12
network over the miniImageNet dataset, we show that our algorithm outperforms
baseline meta-learning algorithms, while other baseline bilevel optimizers do
not solve such meta-learning problems within a comparable time frame.

2006 California implemented a unique firearm monitoring program, the Armed and

APPS program first identifies those firearm owners who become prohibited from
owning one due to federal or state law, then confiscates their firearms. Our
goal is to assess the effect of APPS on California murder rates using annual,

increased monitoring and enforcement from the APPS program substantially
decreased homicides in California. We also find that the effect on murder is

mining applications on graphs, either as a standalone problem or as part of
node classification. Many label propagation algorithms utilize random walks (or
network propagation), which provide limited ability to take into account
negatively-labeled nodes (i.e., nodes that are known to be not associated with
the label of interest). Specialized algorithms to incorporate negatively
labeled samples generally focus on learning or readjusting the edge weights to
drive walks away from negatively-labeled nodes and toward positively-labeled
nodes. This approach has several disadvantages, as it increases the number of
parameters to be learned, and does not necessarily drive the walk away from
regions of the network that are rich in negatively-labeled nodes.
  We reformulate random walk with restarts and network propagation to enable
""variable restarts"", that is the increased likelihood of restarting at a
positively-labeled node when a negatively-labeled node is encountered. Based on
this reformulation, we develop CusTaRd, an algorithm that effectively combines
variable restart probabilities and edge re-weighting to avoid
negatively-labeled nodes. In addition to allowing variable restarts, CusTaRd
samples negatively-labeled nodes from neighbors of positively-labeled nodes to
better characterize the difference between positively and negatively labeled
nodes. To assess the performance of CusTaRd, we perform comprehensive
experiments on four network datasets commonly used in benchmarking label
propagation and node classification algorithms. Our results show that CusTaRd
consistently outperforms competing algorithms that learn/readjust edge weights,

improves predictive accuracy.

various anomalous behaviors including hydrodynamic instability, negative

varying signs of the slope of the mass-radius relation, anomalously large and

unitary principal series representations of the Lie algebra $gl_n(\mathbb{C})$.
The Gelfand-Tsetlin basis for an infinite-dimensional representation can be
defined as the basis of common eigenfunctions of corner quantum minors of the
corresponding L-operator. The construction is based on the induction with
respect to the rank of the algebra: an element of the basis for

element of the basis for $gl_{n-1}(\mathbb{C})$. The integration variables are
the parameters (in other words, the quantum numbers) setting the eigenfunction.
Explicit results are obtained for ranks $3$ and $4$, and the orthogonality of
constructed sets of basis elements is demonstrated. For $gl_3(\mathbb{C})$ the
kernel of the integral is expressed in terms of gamma-functions of the
parameters of eigenfunctions, and in the case of $gl_4(\mathbb{C})$ -- in terms
of a hypergeometric function of the complex field at unity. The formulas

energized; as a consequence, they enter a state of low Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG)
entropy relative to the thermal state. The Vlasov equations predict that in a
collisionless plasma with closed boundaries, BG entropy is formally conserved,
along with an infinite set of Casimir invariants; this provides a seemingly
strong constraint that may explain how plasmas maintain low entropy.
Nevertheless, it is commonly believed that entropy production is enabled by
phase mixing or nonlinear entropy cascades. The question of whether such
anomalous entropy production occurs, and of how to characterize it
quantitatively, is a fundamental problem in plasma physics. We construct a new
theoretical framework for characterizing entropy production (in a generalized
sense) based on ideally conserved dimensional quantities derived from the
Casimir invariants; these are referred to as ``Casimir momenta'' and they
generalize BG entropy. The growth of Casimir momenta relative to the average
particle momentum indicates entropy production. We apply this framework to
quantify entropy production in particle-in-cell simulations of laminar flows
and turbulent flows driven in relativistic plasma, where efficient nonthermal
particle acceleration is enabled. We demonstrate that a large amount of
anomalous entropy is produced by turbulence despite nonthermal features. These
results have implications for reduced modeling of nonthermal particle
acceleration and for diagnosing irreversible dissipation in collisionless
plasmas such as the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. Dimensional
representations of generalized entropy analogous to Casimir momenta may be
useful for other problems in statistical physics.

Self-assembly of diblockor triblock copolymers can lead to tubular polymersomes

value contrary to the Rayleigh-Plateau in-stability, an already known or if the
spontaneous curvature is in a specific range whichdepends on membrane tension.
For the case of spontaneous curvature-induced shape insta-bility, two dynamical

of the most unstablemode tends to a constant as membrane viscosity increases.
In this mode, its growth ratebecomes independent of the bulk viscosity in the

tight-binding (TB) approximation, we study the charge and spin transport
properties through a $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbon (BNR) with the different
edge shapes. We show when a BNR exposed to a nonlocal exchange magnetic field,
the spin filtering occurs for both spin-up and spin-down so that the spin
direction of transmitted electrons could be controlled by adjusting the energy
of incoming electrons with the help of an external backgate voltage. It is
found that an armchair BNR (ABNR) in the simultaneous presence of a transverse
electric field and a nonlocal exchange field indicates a half-metallic nature
which is electrically controllable. Moreover, the influence of local exchange
field fields is evaluated by exposing the edges of ABNR to ferromagnetic strips
with parallel and antiparallel configurations. Our findings show that the edge
manipulations in ABNRs lead to the emergence of a giant magnetoresistance and a
perfect spin filter. Finally, we studied the effects of edge vacancies and
Anderson disorder on the spin-dependent conductance of an ABNR and find that
the perfect spin polarization is not destroyed in the presence of Anderson
disorder and various single vacancies. Our results reveal the outstanding spin

diffusive scaling, using the physics informed neural networks (PINNs). The idea
of PINNs is to minimize a least-square loss function, that consists of the
residual from the governing equation, the mismatch from the boundary
conditions, and other physical constraints such as conservation. It is
advantageous of being flexible and easy to execute, and brings the potential
for high dimensional problems. Nevertheless, due the presence of small scales,
the vanilla PINNs can be extremely unstable for solving multiscale steady
transfer equations. In this paper, we propose a new formulation of the loss
based on the macro-micro decomposition. We prove that, the new loss function is
uniformly stable with respect to the small Knudsen number in the sense that the
$L^2$-error of the neural network solution is uniformly controlled by the loss.
When the boundary condition is an-isotropic, a boundary layer emerges in the
diffusion limit and therefore brings an additional difficulty in training the
neural network. To resolve this issue, we include a boundary layer corrector
that carries over the sharp transition part of the solution and leaves the rest
easy to be approximated. The effectiveness of the new methodology is
demonstrated in extensive numerical examples.

need to recognize inputs that are far or out-of-distribution (OoD) with respect
to the known or training data. To achieve this, many methods estimate
class-conditional posterior probabilities and use confidence scores obtained
from the posterior distributions. Recent works propose to use multivariate
Gaussian distributions as models of posterior distributions at different layers
of the CNN (i.e., for low- and upper-level features), which leads to the
confidence scores based on the Mahalanobis distance. However, this procedure
involves estimating probability density in high dimensional data using the
insufficient number of observations (e.g. the dimensionality of features at the
last two layers in the ResNet-101 model are 2048 and 1024, with ca. 1000
observations per class used to estimate density). In this work, we want to
address this problem. We show that in many OoD studies in high-dimensional
data, LOF-based (Local Outlierness-Factor) methods outperform the parametric,
Mahalanobis distance-based methods. This motivates us to propose the
nonparametric, LOF-based method of generating the confidence scores for CNNs.
We performed several feasibility studies involving ResNet-101 and
EffcientNet-B3, based on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet (as known data), and CIFAR-100,
SVHN, ImageNet2010, Places365, or ImageNet-O (as outliers). We demonstrated
that nonparametric LOF-based confidence estimation can improve current
Mahalanobis-based SOTA or obtain similar performance in a simpler way.

accounting for fixed effects and random effects from multiple sources of

available and it is of interest to select a parsimonious subset of those being
effectively relevant for predicting the response variable. Variational
approximations facilitate fast approximate Bayesian inference for the
parameters of a variety of statistical models, including linear mixed models.
However, for models having a high number of fixed or random effects, simple
application of standard variational inference principles does not lead to fast

inefficient treatment of sparse matrix problems arising from the required
approximating density parameters updates. We illustrate how recently developed
streamlined variational inference procedures can be generalized to make fast

random effects and global-local priors for Bayesian fixed effects selection.
Our variational inference algorithms achieve convergence to the same optima of
their standard implementations, although with significantly lower computational
effort, memory usage and time, especially for large numbers of random effects.
Using simulated and real data examples, we assess the quality of automated

high-resolution signatures to inform disease prognosis and precision medicine.
This paper takes an important first step towards this goal by developing an
interpretable machine learning algorithm, CloudPred, to predict individuals'
disease phenotypes from their scRNA-seq data. Predicting phenotype from
scRNA-seq is challenging for standard machine learning methods -- the number of
cells measured can vary by orders of magnitude across individuals and the cell
populations are also highly heterogeneous. Typical analysis creates pseudo-bulk
samples which are biased toward prior annotations and also lose the single cell
resolution. CloudPred addresses these challenges via a novel end-to-end
differentiable learning algorithm which is coupled with a biologically informed
mixture of cell types model. CloudPred automatically infers the cell
subpopulation that are salient for the phenotype without prior annotations. We
developed a systematic simulation platform to evaluate the performance of
CloudPred and several alternative methods we propose, and find that CloudPred
outperforms the alternative methods across several settings. We further
validated CloudPred on a real scRNA-seq dataset of 142 lupus patients and
controls. CloudPred achieves AUROC of 0.98 while identifying a specific
subpopulation of CD4 T cells whose presence is highly indicative of lupus.
CloudPred is a powerful new framework to predict clinical phenotypes from
scRNA-seq data and to identify relevant cells.

photoinduced quantum phase transition between distinct topological phases has
been considered as a promising route to realize ultrafast topological quantum
computers. Here we use first-principles and effective Hamiltonian methods to
show that in ZrTe$_5$, a layered topological material, lattice distortions
corresponding to all three types of zone-center infrared optical phonon modes
can drive the system from the strong or weak topological insulating phase to a
Weyl semimetal by breaking the global inversion symmetry. Thus achieved Weyl
phases are robust, highly tunable and one of the cleanest ones due to the
proximity of the Weyl points to the Fermi level and a lack of other carriers.
We further show that the amount of infrared-mode pumping necessary to induce
such Weyl phases can be reduced if used in conjunction with an A$_g$ Raman-mode
pumping that first drives the system to the Dirac semimetal state. We also find
that Berry curvature dipole moment (BCDM), induced by the dynamical inversion
symmetry breaking, gives rise to various nonlinear effects that oscillate with
the amplitude of the phonon modes. These nonlinear effects present a novel
switch for controlling the Weyltronics enabled quantum system.

compactifies theimage of a period map arising from a particular two-parameter
family of Calabi-Yau threefolds studied by Hosono and Takagi, with Hodge

sufficiently. Hence, we extensively investigate composition of temporal
augmentations suitable for learning audiovisual representations; we find lossy

videos are the most effective. Furthermore, we show that the effectiveness of
these transformations scales with higher temporal resolution and stronger

  Reusable Resources"" By Rajan Udwani Journal version: Under submission in
  Mathematics of Operations Research",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the classic online bipartite matching problem with a twist: offline
vertices, called resources, are $\textit{reusable}$. In particular, when a
resource is matched to an online vertex it is unavailable for a deterministic
time duration $d$ after which it becomes available again for a re-match. Thus,
a resource can be matched to many different online vertices over a period of
time. While recent work on the problem have resolved the asymptotic case where
we have large starting inventory (i.e., many copies) of every resource, we
consider the (more general) case of $\textit{unit inventory}$ and give the
first algorithms that are provably better than the naive greedy approach which
has a competitive ratio of (exactly) 0.5. Our first algorithm, which achieves a
competitive ratio of $0.589$, generalizes the classic RANKING algorithm for
online bipartite matching of non-reusable resources (Karp et al., 1990), by
$\textit{reranking}$ resources independently over time. While reranking
resources frequently has the same worst case performance as greedy, we show
that reranking intermittently on a periodic schedule succeeds in addressing
reusability of resources and performs significantly better than greedy in the
worst case. Our second algorithm, which achieves a competitive ratio of
$0.505$, is a primal-dual randomized algorithm that works by suggesting up to
two resources as candidate matches for every online vertex, and then breaking
the tie to make the final matching selection in a randomized correlated fashion
over time. As a key component of our algorithm, we suitably adapt and extend
the powerful technique of online correlated selection (Fahrbach et al., 2020)
to reusable resources, in order to induce negative correlation in our tie
breaking step and to beat the competitive ratio of $0.5$. Both of our results
also extend to the case where offline vertices have weights.

develop a perturbation theory that provides semi-analytical dynamic solutions

in such systems and allows solving several difficulties in their modeling, such
as extracting the switching current in magnetic random access memories (MRAM)

directly predicts the critical switching current, i.e., switching current for

that switching by a finite pulse is possible.

large wavenumbers. A comparison of the flow of polymeric fluids and the
wormlike micellar solutions at maximum drag reduction (MDR) shows comparable
drag-reduction effects, with a large decrease in Reynolds shear stresses, and
increased turbulence anisotropy in the buffer layer due to the large streamwise
fluctuations and near-zero wall-normal fluctuations. Additionally, the MDR
regime was bounded by Virk's asymptote for both polymers and the micellar gel,

reinforcement learning (RL) approach by fully exploring the historical ocean
current profiles. The planner will search for a path to optimize a chosen cost
criterion, such as maximizing the total harvested energy for a given time.
Model predictive control (MPC) is then utilized to design the tracking control
for the optimal path command from the planner subject to problem constraints.
The planner and the tracking control are accommodated in an integrated
framework to optimize these two parts in a real-time manner. The proposed
approach is validated on a marine current turbine (MCT) that executes vertical
waypoint path searching to maximize the net power due to spatiotemporal
uncertainties in the ocean environment, as well as the path following via an
MPC tracking controller to navigate the MCT to the optimal path. Results
demonstrate that the path planning increases harnessed power compared to the
baseline (i.e., maintaining MCT at an equilibrium depth), and the tracking
controller can successfully follow the reference path under different shear
profiles.

where the channel state information (CSI) is estimated via pilot symbols that
are orthogonal in a cell but re-used in other cells. Re-using the pilots,
however, contaminates the CSI estimate at each base station (BS) by the channel
of the users sharing the same pilot in other cells. The resulting inter-cell
interference does not vanish even when the number of BS antennas $M$ is large,
i.e., $M\rightarrow\infty$, and thus the rates achieved by treating
interference as noise (TIN) saturate even if $M\rightarrow\infty$. In this
paper, interference aware decoding schemes based on simultaneous unique
decoding (SD) and simultaneous non-unique decoding (SND) of the full
interference or a part of the interference (PD) are studied with two different
linear precoding techniques: maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero forcing
(ZF). The resulting rates are shown to grow unbounded as $M\rightarrow\infty$.
In addition, the rates achievable via SD/SND/PD for finite $M$ are derived
using a worst-case uncorrelated noise technique, which are shown to scale as
$\mathcal{O}(\log M)$. To compare the performance of different schemes, the
maximum symmetric rate problem is studied, where it is confirmed that with
large, yet practical, values of $M$, SND strictly outperforms TIN, and also
that PD strictly outperforms SND.

properties. The ability to accurately predict this temperature field in detail,
and relate it quantitatively to structure and properties, is a key step in
predicting part performance and optimizing process design. In this work, a
finite element simulation of the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process is
used to predict the space- and time-dependent temperature field during the
multi-layer build process for Inconel 718 walls. The thermal model is validated
using the dynamic infrared (IR) images captured in situ during the DED builds,
showing good agreement with experimental measurements. The relationship between
predicted cooling rate, microstructural features, and mechanical properties is
examined, and cooling rate alone is found to be insufficient in giving
quantitative property predictions. Because machine learning offers an efficient
way to identify important features from series data, we apply a 1D
convolutional neural network (CNN) data-driven framework to automatically
extract the dominant predictive features from simulated temperature history.
The relationship between the CNN-extracted features and the mechanical
properties is studied. To interpret how CNN performs in intermediate layers, we
visualize the extracted features produced on each convolutional layer by a
trained CNN. Our results show that the results predicted by the CNN agree well
with experimental measurements and give insights into physical mechanisms of
microstructure evolution and mechanical properties.

Vehicles (AVs) in a complex and dynamic environment. Numerous studies have been
conducted for AV evaluation using traffic simulation over the past decades.
However, the current simulation environments fall behind on two fronts -- the
background vehicles (BVs) fail to simulate naturalistic driving behavior and
the existing environments do not test the entire pipeline in a modular fashion.
This study aims to propose a simulation framework that creates a complex and
naturalistic traffic environment. Specifically, we combine a modified version
of the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) simulator with the Cars Learning to
Act (CARLA) simulator to generate a simulation environment that could emulate
the complexities of the external environment while providing realistic sensor
outputs to the AV pipeline. In a past research work, we created an open-source
Python package called SUMO-Gym which generates a realistic road network and
naturalistic traffic through SUMO and combines that with OpenAI Gym to provide
ease of use for the end user. We propose to extend our developed software by
adding CARLA, which in turn will enrich the perception of the ego vehicle by
providing realistic sensors outputs of the AVs surrounding environment. Using
the proposed framework, AVs perception, planning, and control could be tested
in a complex and realistic driving environment. The performance of the proposed
framework in constructing output generation and AV evaluations are demonstrated
using several case studies.

of the magnetars whose spin-down is dominated by DRs ($n\lesssim 3$) and
adopting a universal radiation efficiency of $0.3$, we find that the typical
magnetic field strength ($B_p$) is $10^{16}$ G {\em vs.} $10^{15}$ G and the
typical initial period ($P_0$) is $\sim 20$ ms {\em vs.} $2$ ms for the
magnetars in the sGRBs {\em vs.} lGRBs. They follow the same relation between
$P_0$ and the isotropic GRB energy as $ P_0\propto E_{\rm jet}^{-0.4}$. We also
extend our comparison analysis to superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and stable
pulsars. Our results show that a magnetar born in merger of compact stars tends
to have a stronger $B_p$ and a longer $P_0$ by about one order of magnitude
than that born in collapse of massive stars. Its spin-down is dominated by the
magnetic DRs as old pulsars, being due to its strong magnetic field strength,
whereas the early spin-down of magnetars born in massive star collapse is
governed by both the DRs and gravitational wave (GW) emission. A magnetar with
a faster rotation speed should power a more energetic jet, being independent of

because the last encoder block is dominantly supervised compared with lower
blocks. This paper proposes a new residual auxiliary EEND (RX-EEND) learning
architecture for transformers to enforce the lower encoder blocks to learn more
accurately. The auxiliary loss is applied to the output of each encoder block,
including the last encoder block. The effect of auxiliary loss on the learning
of the encoder blocks can be further increased by adding a residual connection

boundary conditions on the plates. The case of Neumann boundary conditions is
uninteresting, since it yields the same result as the case of Dirichlet

regularization technique that allows me to obtain exact expressions for the
Casimir energy and pressure. I discover that, when the compactified length of
the extra dimension is similar to the plate distance, or slightly larger, the
Casimir energy and pressure become significantly different than their standard
three dimensional values, for either Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions.
Therefore, the Casimir effect of a quantum field that permeates a compactified

overcome this problem while maintaining the advantages of the class-wise

cytoskeleton, are increasingly used as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and
fundamental studies in cell biology. Recent experiments suggest that the cell
cytoskeleton and its permeating cytosol, can be described as a poroelastic (PE)
material. Biot theory is the standard model used to describe PE materials. Yet,
this theory does not account for the fluid viscous stress, which can lead to
inaccurate predictions of the mechanics in the dilute filamentous network of
the cytoskeleton. Here, we adopt a two-phase model that extends Biot theory by
including the fluid viscous stresses in the fluid's momentum equation. We use
generalized linear viscoelastic (VE) constitutive equations to describe the
permeating fluid and the network stresses and assume a constant friction
coefficient that couples the fluid and network displacement fields. As the
first step in developing a computational framework for solving the resulting
equations, we derive closed-form general solutions of the fluid and network
displacement fields in spherical coordinates. To demonstrate the applicability
of our results, we study the motion of a rigid sphere moving under a constant
force inside a PE medium, composed of a linear elastic network and a Newtonian
fluid. We find that the network compressibility introduces a slow relaxation of
the sphere and a non-monotonic network displacements with time along the
direction of the applied force. These novel features cannot be predicted if VE
constitutive equation is used for the medium. We show that our results can be
applied to particle-tracking microrheology to differentiate between PE and VE
materials and to independently measure the permeability and VE properties of
the fluid and the network phases.

local visual features with a set of seen classes and leveraging global visual
features makes the knowledge transfer ineffective. To tackle this problem, we
propose a Region Semantically Aligned Network (RSAN), which maps local features
of unseen classes to their semantic attributes. Instead of using global
features which are obtained by an average pooling layer after an image encoder,
we directly utilize the output of the image encoder which maintains local
information of the image. Concretely, we obtain each attribute from a specific
region of the output and exploit these attributes for recognition. As a result,
the knowledge of seen classes can be successfully transferred to unseen classes
in a region-bases manner. In addition, we regularize the image encoder through
attribute regression with a semantic knowledge to extract robust and

highest inner product with a given query user, is an essential problem in the
recommendation field. It is usual that e-commerce companies face situations
where they want to promote and sell new or discounted items. In these
situations, we have to consider a question: who are interested in the items and
how to find them? This paper answers this question by addressing a new problem
called reverse maximum inner product search (reverse MIPS). Given a query
vector and two sets of vectors (user vectors and item vectors), the problem of
reverse MIPS finds a set of user vectors whose inner product with the query
vector is the maximum among the query and item vectors. Although the importance
of this problem is clear, its straightforward implementation incurs a
computationally expensive cost. We therefore propose Simpfer, a simple, fast,
and exact algorithm for reverse MIPS. In an offline phase, Simpfer builds a
simple index that maintains a lower-bound of the maximum inner product. By
exploiting this index, Simpfer judges whether the query vector can have the
maximum inner product or not, for a given user vector, in a constant time.
Besides, our index enables filtering user vectors, which cannot have the
maximum inner product with the query vector, in a batch. We theoretically
demonstrate that Simpfer outperforms baselines employing state-of-the-art MIPS
techniques. Furthermore, our extensive experiments on real datasets show that
Simpfer is at least two orders magnitude faster than the baselines.

hang over deep learning. Both of them harness task-irrelevant features of data
in their implementation. Text style is a feature that is naturally irrelevant
to most NLP tasks, and thus suitable for adversarial and backdoor attacks. In
this paper, we make the first attempt to conduct adversarial and backdoor
attacks based on text style transfer, which is aimed at altering the style of a
sentence while preserving its meaning. We design an adversarial attack method
and a backdoor attack method, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate
them. Experimental results show that popular NLP models are vulnerable to both
adversarial and backdoor attacks based on text style transfer -- the attack
success rates can exceed 90% without much effort. It reflects the limited
ability of NLP models to handle the feature of text style that has not been
widely realized. In addition, the style transfer-based adversarial and backdoor
attack methods show superiority to baselines in many aspects. All the code and

activity to maintain its functionality when it is perturbed. To study
resilience of dynamics on networks, Gao et al. proposed a theoretical framework
to reduce dynamical systems on networks, which are high dimensional in general,
to one-dimensional dynamical systems. The accuracy of this one-dimensional
reduction relies on several assumption in addition to the assumption that the
network has a negligible degree correlation. In the present study, we analyze
the accuracy of the one-dimensional reduction assuming networks without degree
correlation. We do so mainly through examining the validity of the individual
assumptions underlying the method. Across five dynamical system models, we find
that the accuracy of the one-dimensional reduction hinges on the spread of the
equilibrium value of the state variable across the nodes in most cases.
Specifically, the one-dimensional reduction tends to be accurate when the
dispersion of the node's state is small. We also find that the correlation
between the node's state and the node's degree, which is common for various
dynamical systems on networks, is unrelated to the accuracy of the
one-dimensional reduction.

explore the upper limit of deep models. However, large language model
pre-training costs intensive computational resources and most of the models are
trained from scratch without reusing the existing pre-trained models, which is
wasteful. In this paper, we propose bert2BERT, which can effectively transfer
the knowledge of an existing smaller pre-trained model (e.g., BERT_BASE) to a
large model (e.g., BERT_LARGE) through parameter initialization and
significantly improve the pre-training efficiency of the large model.
Specifically, we extend the previous function-preserving on Transformer-based
language model, and further improve it by proposing advanced knowledge for
large model's initialization. In addition, a two-stage pre-training method is
proposed to further accelerate the training process. We did extensive
experiments on representative PLMs (e.g., BERT and GPT) and demonstrate that
(1) our method can save a significant amount of training cost compared with
baselines including learning from scratch, StackBERT and MSLT; (2) our method
is generic and applicable to different types of pre-trained models. In
particular, bert2BERT saves about 45% and 47% computational cost of
pre-training BERT_BASE and GPT_BASE by reusing the models of almost their half
sizes. The source code will be publicly available upon publication.

The first advantage of this formulation is that an exact and analytic solution
for single scattering, regardless of the number of volumetric layers, can be
derived. We propose to approximate multiple scattering by an additional
single-scattering lobe with modified parameters and a Lambertian lobe. We use a
parameter mapping neural network to find the parameters of the newly added

absence of layer interfaces, we demonstrate that many common material effects
can be achieved with layers of SGGX microflake and other volumes with
appropriate parameters. A normal mapping effect can also be achieved through
mapping of microflake orientations, which avoids artifacts common in standard
normal maps. Thanks to the analytical formulation, our model is very fast to
evaluate and sample. Through various parameter settings, our model is able to
handle many types of materials, like plastics, wood, cloth, etc., opening a

However, the current process of obtaining these shape descriptors from imaging

to be repeated to infer shape descriptors for new image data using a

computational time, making it a viable solution for fully end-to-end SSM
applications. In addition, we introduce a model-based data-augmentation
strategy to address data scarcity. Finally, this paper presents and analyzes
two different architectural variants of DeepSSM with different loss functions

real-world, noisy data. However, it is still unclear why models are less robust
to some perturbations than others. In this work, we test the hypothesis that
the extent to which a model is affected by an unseen textual perturbation
(robustness) can be explained by the learnability of the perturbation (defined
as how well the model learns to identify the perturbation with a small amount
of evidence). We further give a causal justification for the learnability
metric. We conduct extensive experiments with four prominent NLP models --
TextRNN, BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet -- over eight types of textual perturbations
on three datasets. We show that a model which is better at identifying a
perturbation (higher learnability) becomes worse at ignoring such a
perturbation at test time (lower robustness), providing empirical support for
our hypothesis.

  with Enhanced Topic Coherence",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a transformer over transformer framework, called
Transformer$^2$, to perform neural text segmentation. It consists of two
components: bottom-level sentence encoders using pre-trained transformers, and
an upper-level transformer-based segmentation model based on the sentence
embeddings. The bottom-level component transfers the pre-trained knowledge
learned from large external corpora under both single and pair-wise supervised
NLP tasks to model the sentence embeddings for the documents. Given the
sentence embeddings, the upper-level transformer is trained to recover the
segmentation boundaries as well as the topic labels of each sentence. Equipped
with a multi-task loss and the pre-trained knowledge, Transformer$^2$ can
better capture the semantic coherence within the same segments. Our experiments
show that (1) Transformer$^2$ manages to surpass state-of-the-art text
segmentation models in terms of a commonly-used semantic coherence measure; (2)
in most cases, both single and pair-wise pre-trained knowledge contribute to
the model performance; (3) bottom-level sentence encoders pre-trained on
specific languages yield better performance than those pre-trained on specific
domains.

Recent work suggests that the degree of hallucination may depend on errors in

variations in noise in training samples to reduce hallucination. We first

the absence of noise, the proposed model exhibits birhythmicity of two

transition rate increases with the noise intensity. Our results provide a

dynamics produced by the proposed model heavily rely on the initial conditions
when noise is weak; while for intermediate and strong noise, the burst dynamics
are independent of the initial condition.

of Gd$_x$(FeCo)$_{1-x}$ at femtosecond time scales. Optical excitations are
found to drive charge from Fe majority $d$-states to the unoccupied Gd
$f$-minority states, with $f$-electron character excited occupation lagging
behind that of the $d$-electron character, leading to substantial
demagnetisation of both species while leaving the global moment almost
unchanged. For $x > 0.33$ this results in the creation of an ultrafast
ferromagnetic (FM) transient by the end of the laser pulse, with the Gd
demagnetization rate slower than that of Fe. For all concentrations the Gd
moments begin to rotate from their ground state orientations developing
in-plane moments of between 0.2-0.5~$\mu_B$. Thus, the ultrafast spin dynamics
of the material captures three important ingredients of the all optical
switching that occurs at much later (picosecond) times: (i) the development of
a FM transient, (ii) the different rates of demagnetisation of Fe and Gd and,
(iii), the breaking of the colinear symmetry of the ground state. Furthermore,
several predictions are made about the behaviour of Fe-Gd alloys that can be
experimentally tested and can lead to a spin-filtering device.

perform denoising while preserving edges. It has disadvantages in that it is
nonlinear, and its computational complexity and hardware resources are directly
proportional to its window size. Thus far, several approximation methods and
hardware implementations have been proposed to solve these problems. However,
processing large-scale and high-resolution images in real time under severe
hardware resource constraints remains a challenge.
  This paper proposes a real-time image denoising system that uses an FPGA
based on the bilateral grid (BG). In the BG, a 2D image consisting of x- and
y-axes is projected onto a 3D space called a ""grid,"" which consists of axes
that correlate to the x-component, y-component, and intensity value of the
input image. This grid is then blurred using the Gaussian filter, and the
output image is generated by interpolating the grid. Although it is possible to
change the window size in the BF, it is impossible to change it on the input
image in the BG. This makes it difficult to associate the BG with the BF and to
obtain the property of suppressing the increase in hardware resources when the
window radius is enlarged.
  This study demonstrates that a BG with a variable-sized window can be
realized by introducing the window radius parameter wherein the window radius
on the grid is always 1. We then implement this BG on an FPGA in a fully
pipelined manner. Further, we verify that our design suppresses the increase in
hardware resources even when the window size is enlarged and outperforms the
existing designs in terms of computation speed and hardware resources.

modeling strategies designed to exploit graph structure in tasks such as node
property prediction. The former is typically based on stacked message-passing
layers that share neighborhood information to transform node features into
predictive embeddings. In contrast, the latter involves spreading label
information to unlabeled nodes via a parameter-free diffusion process, but
operates independently of the node features. Given then that the material
difference is merely whether features or labels are smoothed across the graph,
it is natural to consider combinations of the two for improving performance. In
this regard, it has recently been proposed to use a randomly-selected portion
of the training labels as GNN inputs, concatenated with the original node
features for making predictions on the remaining labels. This so-called label
trick accommodates the parallel use of features and labels, and is foundational
to many of the top-ranking submissions on the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)
leaderboard. And yet despite its wide-spread adoption, thus far there has been
little attempt to carefully unpack exactly what statistical properties the
label trick introduces into the training pipeline, intended or otherwise. To
this end, we prove that under certain simplifying assumptions, the stochastic
label trick can be reduced to an interpretable, deterministic training
objective composed of two factors. The first is a data-fitting term that
naturally resolves potential label leakage issues, while the second serves as a
regularization factor conditioned on graph structure that adapts to graph size
and connectivity. Later, we leverage this perspective to motivate a broader
range of label trick use cases, and provide experiments to verify the efficacy

nucleoid, which is composed essentially of DNA (80%), RNA (10%), and a number
of different proteins (10%). These nucleoid proteins act as regulators of gene
expression and influence the organization of the nucleoid by bridging, bending,
or wrapping the DNA. These so-called architectural properties of nucleoid
proteins are still poorly understood. For example, the reason why certain
proteins compact the DNA coil in certain environments but make instead the DNA
more rigid in other environments is the matter of ongoing debates. Here, we
address the question of the impact of the self-association of nucleoid proteins
on their architectural properties and try to determine whether differences in
self-association are sufficient to induce large changes in the organization of
the DNA coil. More specifically, we developed two coarse-grained models of
proteins, which interact identically with the DNA but self-associate
differently by forming either clusters or filaments in the absence of the DNA.
We showed through Brownian dynamics simulations that self-association of the
proteins increases dramatically their ability to shape the DNA coil. Moreover,
we observed that cluster-forming proteins compact significantly the DNA coil
(similar to the DNA-bridging mode of H-NS proteins), whereas filament-forming
proteins increase instead significantly the stiffness of the DNA chain (similar
to the DNA-stiffening mode of H-NS proteins). This work consequently suggests
that the knowledge of the DNA-binding properties of the proteins is in itself
not sufficient to understand their architectural properties. Rather, their
self-association properties must also be investigated in detail, because they
might actually drive the formation of different DNA/protein complexes.

for complex systems simultaneously structured in space and time. However, a
realistic description of time-varying materials requires considering their
material dispersion. The combination thereof has barely been considered but is
crucial since dispersion accompanies materials suitable for dynamic modulation.
As a canonical scattering problem from which many general insights can be

samples improves the basic model, and using a global negative queue further
improves and stabilizes the model while training with hard negative samples. We
evaluate the coherence model on task-independent test sets that resemble
real-world applications and show significant improvements in coherence
evaluations of downstream tasks.

the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the
sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output

large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a
unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for
both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this
unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach
that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface
between encoder and decoder. Extensive evaluations show the superiority of the

is greatly affected by several degrading effects. Recently, deep learning-based
perception methods have addressed multiple degrading effects to reflect
real-world bad weather cases but have shown limited success due to 1) high
computational costs for deployment on mobile devices and 2) poor relevance
between image enhancement and visual perception in terms of the model ability.
To solve these issues, we propose a task-driven image enhancement network
connected to the high-level vision task, which takes in an image corrupted by
bad weather as input. Specifically, we introduce a novel low memory network to
reduce most of the layer connections of dense blocks for less memory and
computational cost while maintaining high performance. We also introduce a new
task-driven training strategy to robustly guide the high-level task model
suitable for both high-quality restoration of images and highly accurate

the performance among lane and 2D object detection, and depth estimation

an octopus pushes a bend (localized region of large curvature) from the base to
the tip of the arm. Bend propagation arises from the complex interplay between
mechanics of the flexible arm, forces generated by internal muscles, and
environmental effects (buoyancy and drag) from of the surrounding fluid. In
part due to this complexity, much of prior modeling and analysis work has
relied on the use of high dimensional computational models. The contribution of
this paper is to present a control-oriented reduced order model based upon a
novel parametrization of the curvature of the octopus arm. The parametrization
is motivated by the experimental results. The reduced order model is related to
and derived from a computational model which is also presented. The results
from the two sets of models are compared using numerical simulations which is
shown to lead to useful qualitative insights into bend propagation. A

in regional and global climate trends. Thawing and degradation of permafrost
has numerous adverse environmental, economic, and societal impacts.
Mathematical modeling and numerical simulations provide powerful tools for
predicting the degree of degradation and evolution of subsurface permafrost as
a result of global warming. A particularly significant characteristic of alpine
environments is the high variability in their topography and geomorphology
which drives large lateral thermal and fluid fluxes. Additionally, harsh winds,
extreme weather conditions, and various degrees of saturation have to be
considered. The combination of large lateral fluxes and unsaturated ground
makes alpine systems markedly different from Arctic permafrost environments and
general geotechnical ground freezing applications, and therefore, alpine
permafrost demands its own specialized modeling approaches. In this research
work, we present a multi-physics permafrost model tailored to alpine regions.
In particular, we resolve the ice-water phase transitions, unsaturated
conditions, and capillary actions, and account for the impact of the evolving
pore volume on fluid-matrix interactions. Moreover, the approach is
multi-dimensional, and therefore, inherently resolves fluxes along topographic
gradients. Through numerical cases studies based on the elevation profiles of
the two prominent peaks of the Zugspitze (DE) and the Matterhorn (CH), we show
the strong influence of topography driven thermal and fluid fluxes on active
layer dynamics and the distribution of permafrost.

expensive compared to traditional microscopes. In addition, the point scanning
in a confocal leads to slow imaging speed and photobleaching due to the high
dose of laser energy. In this paper, we demonstrate how the advances in machine
learning can be exploited to ""teach"" a traditional wide-field microscope, one
that's available in every lab, into producing 3D volumetric images like a
confocal. The key idea is to obtain multiple images with different focus
settings using a wide-field microscope and use a 3D Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) based neural network to learn the mapping between the blurry
low-contrast image stack obtained using wide-field and the sharp, high-contrast
images obtained using a confocal. After training the network with
widefield-confocal image pairs, the network can reliably and accurately
reconstruct 3D volumetric images that rival confocal in terms of its lateral
resolution, z-sectioning and image contrast. Our experimental results
demonstrate generalization ability to handle unseen data, stability in the
reconstruction results, high spatial resolution even when imaging thick

model we add a rate at which individuals are tested, and once an infectious
individual tests positive it is isolated and each of their contacts are traced
and tested independently with some fixed probability. If such a traced
individual tests positive it is isolated, and the contact tracing is iterated.
This model is analysed using large population approximations, both for the
early stage of the epidemic when the ""to-be-traced components"" of the epidemic
behaves like a branching process, and for the main stage of the epidemic where
the process of to-be-traced components converges to a deterministic process
defined by a system of differential equations. These approximations are used to
quantify the effect of testing and of contact tracing on the effective
reproduction numbers (for the components as well as for the individuals), the
probability of a major outbreak, and the final fraction getting infected. Using
numerical illustrations when rates of infection and natural recovery are fixed,
it is shown that Test-and-Trace strategy is effective in reducing the
reproduction number. Surprisingly, the reproduction number for the branching
process of components is not monotonically decreasing in the tracing

  Maximum Mean Discrepancy Optimization",,,,,"eess.SP cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We introduce a learning-based algorithm to obtain a measurement matrix for
compressive sensing related recovery problems. The focus lies on matrices with
a constant modulus constraint which typically represent a network of analog
phase shifters in hybrid precoding/combining architectures. We interpret a
matrix with restricted isometry property as a mapping of points from a high- to
a low-dimensional hypersphere. We argue that points on the low-dimensional
hypersphere, namely, in the range of the matrix, should be uniformly
distributed to increase robustness against measurement noise. This notion is
formalized in an optimization problem which uses one of the maximum mean
discrepancy metrics in the objective function. Recent success of such metrics
in neural network related topics motivate a solution of the problem based on
machine learning. Numerical experiments show better performance than random
measurement matrices that are generally employed in compressive sensing
contexts. Further, we adapt a method from the literature to the constant
modulus constraint. This method can also compete with random matrices and it is
shown to harmonize well with the proposed learning-based approach if it is used
as an initialization. Lastly, we describe how other structural matrix
constraints, e.g., a Toeplitz constraint, can be taken into account, too.

the \emph{s}FRBs at higher central frequency are commonly shorter than those at

\emph{s}FRBs. Secondly, we find that fluence and peak flux density are
correlated with a power law relation of $F \varpropto S{^{\gamma}_{p,obs}}$ for
both \emph{s}FRBs and \emph{l}FRBs whose distributions are obviously different.
Thirdly, the \emph{l}FRBs with isotropic energies ranging from $10^{42}$ to

remote sensing to probe clouds and aerosols more accurately and with improved
sampling. Here, we bring new results that support Differential Optical
Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) using oxygen absorption features in the
visible/near-IR spectrum. With known concentration and cross-section, the
remaining unknown in O$_2$ DOAS is the path the light followed through the
absorbing gas. In presence of scattering by cloud or aerosol particles, that
path is broken at each interaction. Cumulative pathlength through the gas is a
random variable, and its probability distribution function (PDF) will contain
desirable information about the clouds or aerosols. Here, we compute
statistical moments of the that PDF, showing that mean and variance convey
different pieces of information, namely, size and opacity of the medium. We
also extend the connection between geometric thickness and mean pathlength in
presence of absorption by the scattering particles. We view pathlength moments
as intermediate products that can be obtained from O$_2$ spectroscopy, and
describe an algorithm to do that. In turn, these moments yield cloud or aerosol
profile parameters of interest: layer geometric and optical thicknesses. One
normally thinks about active sensors, radars and lidars, for such atmospheric
profiling. Here, the profile is parameterized and representative of a
horizontal average determined by multiple scattering. However, there are
advantages in passive vs active instrumentation, starting with the possibility
of imaging over a large swath.

are often noisy and available after some unknown delay that may depend on the
computation time of the oracle. Additionally, if the exact evaluations are

a generic extension of hierarchical optimistic tree search (HOO), called
ProCrastinated Tree Search (PCTS), that flexibly accommodates a delay and
noise-tolerant bandit algorithm. We provide a generic proof technique to
quantify regret of PCTS under delayed, noisy, and multi-fidelity feedbacks.
Specifically, we derive regret bounds of PCTS enabled with delayed-UCB1 (DUCB1)

block for GCNs. Many existing results have focused on the regime of small
perturbation with a small number of edge rewires. However, the number of edge
rewires can be large in many applications. To study the latter case, this work
departs from the previous analysis and proves a bound on the stability of graph
filter relying on the filter's frequency response. Assuming the graph filter is
low pass, we show that the stability of the filter depends on perturbation to
the community structure. As an application, we show that for stochastic block
model graphs, the graph filter distance converges to zero when the number of

surface resistance with direct access to the residual resistance thanks to the
low frequency of the first operating quadrupole mode. Besides the well-known
high resolution of the QPR, a bias of measurement data towards higher values
has been observed, especially at higher harmonic quadrupole modes. Numerical
studies show that this can be explained by parasitic RF losses on the adapter
flange used to mount samples into the QPR. Coating several micrometer of
niobium on those surfaces of the stainless steel flange that are exposed to the
RF fields significantly reduced this bias, enabling a direct measurement of a
residual resistance smaller than 5 n$\Omega$ at 2 K and 413 MHz. A constant
correction based on simulations was not feasible due to deviations from one

modeling sequential and time series data. They are notoriously hard to train
because their loss gradients backpropagated in time tend to saturate or diverge
during training. This is known as the exploding and vanishing gradient problem.
Previous solutions to this issue either built on rather complicated,
purpose-engineered architectures with gated memory buffers, or - more recently
- imposed constraints that ensure convergence to a fixed point or restrict (the
eigenspectrum of) the recurrence matrix. Such constraints, however, convey
severe limitations on the expressivity of the RNN. Essential intrinsic dynamics
such as multistability or chaos are disabled. This is inherently at disaccord
with the chaotic nature of many, if not most, time series encountered in nature
and society. It is particularly problematic in scientific applications where
one aims to reconstruct the underlying dynamical system. Here we offer a
comprehensive theoretical treatment of this problem by relating the loss
gradients during RNN training to the Lyapunov spectrum of RNN-generated orbits.
We mathematically prove that RNNs producing stable equilibrium or cyclic
behavior have bounded gradients, whereas the gradients of RNNs with chaotic
dynamics always diverge. Based on these analyses and insights we suggest ways
of how to optimize the training process on chaotic data according to the
system's Lyapunov spectrum, regardless of the employed RNN architecture.

mathematical optimization solvers, such as Gurobi and CPLEX. In our study, we
determine that QA demonstrates better performance than the solvers in the break
minimization problem in a mirrored double round-robin tournament (MDRRT). We
also explain the desirable performance of QA for the sparse interaction between
variables and a problem without constraints. In this process, we demonstrate
that the break minimization problem in an MDRRT can be expressed as a 4-regular
graph. Through computational experiments, we solve this problem using our QA
approach and two-integer programming approaches, which were performed using the
latest quantum annealer D-Wave Advantage, and the sophisticated mathematical
optimization solver, Gurobi, respectively. Further, we compare the quality of
the solutions and the computational time. QA was able to determine the exact
solution in 0.05 seconds for problems with 20 teams, which is a practical size.
In the case of 36 teams, it took 84.8 s for the integer programming method to
reach the objective function value, which was obtained by the quantum annealer
in 0.05 s. These results not only present the break minimization problem in an
MDRRT as an example of applying QA to practical optimization problems, but also
contribute to find problems that can be effectively solved by QA.

A recent study evaluated recursive processing in recurrent neural language

embedded dependencies within nested constructions -- a prototypical example of
recursion in natural language. Here, we study if state-of-the-art Transformer
LMs do any better. We test four different Transformer LMs on two different
types of nested constructions, which differ in whether the embedded (inner)
dependency is short or long range. We find that Transformers achieve
near-perfect performance on short-range embedded dependencies, significantly
better than previous results reported for RNN-LMs and humans. However, on
long-range embedded dependencies, Transformers' performance sharply drops below
chance level. Remarkably, the addition of only three words to the embedded
dependency caused Transformers to fall from near-perfect to below-chance
performance. Taken together, our results reveal Transformers' shortcoming when
it comes to recursive, structure-based, processing.

band-theory. The basic inputs of this program are the structural information,
dense k-points sampling in the irreducible part of the Brillouin zone and the
information of velocity matrix elements, which can be calculated using
third-party ab-initio package. TRACK is expected to calculate the transport

performing calculation on three different types of materials namely Vanadium

studying neutrino-matter interactions. Prior to the shock-breakout neutrino
burst during the collapse of the iron core, a preshock $\nu_e$ burst arises
from the electron capture of nuclei and it is sensitive to the low-energy
coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) which dominates the
neutrino opacity. Since the CE$\nu$NS depends strongly on the non-standard
neutrino interactions (NSI) which are completely beyond the standard model and
yet to be determined, the detection of the preshock burst thus provides a clean
way to extract the NSI information. Within the spherically symmetric
general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulation for the CCSN, we investigate the
NSI effects on the preshock burst. We find that the NSI can maximally enhance
the peak luminosity of the preshock burst almost by a factor of three, reaching
a value comparable with that of the shock-breakout burst. Future detection of
the preshock burst will have critical implications on astrophysics, neutrino
physics and physics beyond the standard model.

transition (HSIT) mostly focus on two-dimensional material systems where the
transition and its proximate ground-state phases, often exhibit features that
are seemingly at odds with the expected behavior. Here we present a
complementary study of a three-dimensional pressure-packed amorphous
indium-oxide (InOx) powder where granularity controls the HSIT. Above a low
threshold pressure of ~0.2 GPa, vestiges of superconductivity are detected,
although neither a true superconducting transition nor insulating behavior are
observed. Instead, a saturation at very high resistivity at low pressure is
followed by saturation at very low resistivity at higher pressure. We identify
both as different manifestations of anomalous metallic phases dominated by
superconducting fluctuations. By analogy with previous identification of the
low resistance saturation as a ""failed superconductor"", our data suggests that
the very high resistance saturation is a manifestation of a ""failed insulator"".
Above a threshold pressure of ~6 GPa, the sample becomes fully packed, and
superconductivity is robust, with TC tunable with pressure. A quantum critical
point at PC~25 GPa marks the complete suppression of superconductivity. For a
finite pressure below PC, a magnetic field is shown to induce a HSIT from a
true zero-resistance superconducting state to a weakly insulating behavior.
Determining the critical field, HC, we show that similar to the 2D behavior,
the insulating-like state maintains a superconducting character, which is
quenched at higher field, above which the magnetoresistance decreases to its
fermionic normal state value.

loading. Tribo-oxide formation at room temperature is associated with diffusion
processes along defects, such as dislocations or grain boundaries. Here, we
embark on investigating the additional influence of temperature on the
tribo-oxidation of copper. Dry, reciprocating sliding tests were performed with
a variation of the sample temperature between 21 - 150 $^\circ$C.
Microstructural changes were monitored and analyzed with state-of-the-art
electron microscopy techniques. Oxide layer formation through thermal oxidation
was observed for 150 $^\circ$C, but not for lower temperatures. As the
temperature increases from room temperature up to 100 $^\circ$C, a
significantly stronger tribo-oxidation into deeper material layers and an
increase in the amount of formed pores and oxides was detected. Up to 75
$^\circ$C, diffusional processes along grain boundaries and dislocation pipes
were identified. Starting at 100 $^\circ$C, CuO was detected. Hence,
tribological loading significantly alters the CuO formation in comparison with
static oxidation. Along with the CuO formation at temperatures >= 90 $^\circ$C,
the oxide layer thickness decreased while the friction coefficient increased.
The observations broaden our understanding of the elementary mechanisms of
tribo-oxidation in high-purity copper. Eventually, this will allow to
systematically customize surfaces showing tribo-oxidation for specific
tribological applications.

to approximating the individual sub-posteriors for practical necessity, then

of computational limitations, particularly when unifying a large number of

theory, have played an essential role in the development of distributed Nash
equilibrium-seeking algorithms for network systems. Such techniques
intrinsically rely on the uniform asymptotic stability properties of the
dynamics that evolve in each time scale of the closed-loop system. When such
properties are absent, synthesizing multi-time scale Nash equilibrium-seeking
algorithms is more challenging and requires additional regularization
mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the synthesis and analysis of these
mechanisms in the context of accelerated pseudogradient flows with time-varying
damping in non-cooperative games. Specifically, we introduce a new class of
distributed and hybrid Nash set-seeking (NSS) algorithms that synergistically
combine dynamic momentum-based flows with coordinated discrete-time resets. The
reset mechanisms can be seen as restarting techniques that allow individual
players to choose their own momentum restarting policy to achieve better
transient performance. The resulting closed-loop system is modeled as a hybrid
dynamic inclusion, which is analyzed using tools from hybrid dynamical system's
theory. Our algorithms are developed for potential games, as well as for
monotone games for which a potential function does not exist. They can be
implemented in games where players have access to gradient Oracles with full or
partial information, as well as in games where players have access only to
measurements of their costs. In the latter case, we use tools from hybrid
extremum seeking control to achieve accelerated model-free Nash set seeking.

learn from a continuous stream of tasks without forgetting knowledge learned
from the previous tasks. To avoid performance decrease caused by forgetting,
prior studies exploit episodic memory (EM), which stores a subset of the past
observed samples while learning from new non-i.i.d. data. Despite the promising
results, since CL is often assumed to execute on mobile or IoT devices, the EM
size is bounded by the small hardware memory capacity and makes it infeasible
to meet the accuracy requirements for real-world applications. Specifically,
all prior CL methods discard samples overflowed from the EM and can never
retrieve them back for subsequent training steps, incurring loss of information
that would exacerbate catastrophic forgetting. We explore a novel hierarchical
EM management strategy to address the forgetting issue. In particular, in
mobile and IoT devices, real-time data can be stored not just in high-speed
RAMs but in internal storage devices as well, which offer significantly larger
capacity than the RAMs. Based on this insight, we propose to exploit the
abundant storage to preserve past experiences and alleviate the forgetting by
allowing CL to efficiently migrate samples between memory and storage without
being interfered by the slow access speed of the storage. We call it Carousel
Memory (CarM). As CarM is complementary to existing CL methods, we conduct
extensive evaluations of our method with seven popular CL methods and show that
CarM significantly improves the accuracy of the methods across different
settings by large margins in final average accuracy (up to 28.4%) while
retaining the same training efficiency.

using individual semiconductor quantum dots embedded in a topological add-drop
filter. The filter is imprinted within a valley-Hall photonic crystal (PhC)
membrane and comprises a resonator evanescently coupled to a pair of access
waveguides. We show that the longitudinal modes of the resonator enable the
filter to perform wavelength-selective routing of light, protected by the
underlying topology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a quantum dot located
at a chiral point in the resonator, selective coupling occurs between
well-defined spin states and specific output ports of the topological device.
This behaviour is fundamental to the operation of chiral devices such as a
quantum optical circulator. Our device therefore represents a
topologically-protected building block with potential to play an enabling role
in the development of chiral integrated quantum photonic circuits.

  with Diverse Prompts","15 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work (e.g. LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019)) has found that the quality of
the factual information extracted from Large Language Models (LLMs) depends on
the prompts used to query them. This inconsistency is problematic because
different users will query LLMs for the same information using different
wording, but should receive the same, accurate responses regardless. In this
work we aim to address this shortcoming by introducing P-Adapters: lightweight
models that sit between the embedding layer and first attention layer of LLMs.
They take LLM embeddings as input and output continuous prompts that are used
to query the LLM. Additionally, we investigate Mixture of Experts (MoE) models
that learn a set of continuous prompts (""experts"") and select one to query the
LLM. They require a separate classifier trained on human-annotated data to map
natural language prompts to the continuous ones. P-Adapters perform comparably
to the more complex MoE models in extracting factual information from BERT and
RoBERTa while eliminating the need for additional annotations. P-Adapters show
between 12-26% absolute improvement in precision and 36-50% absolute
improvement in consistency over a baseline of only using natural language
queries. Finally, we investigate what makes P-Adapters successful and conclude
that a significant factor is access to the LLM's embeddings of the original
natural language prompt, particularly the subject of the entity pair being
queried.

leverages the novel concept of ""safe relaxing"" where one aims to identify
non-zero coefficients of the solution. It can be viewed as a dual approach to
""safe screening"" introduced in the last decade and allowing to reduce the
problem dimension using the identification of zero coefficients of the

(DeepMoCap) is proposed using multiple spatio-temporally aligned infrared-depth
sensors and retro-reflective straps and patches (reflectors). DeepMoCap
explores motion capture by automatically localizing and labeling reflectors on
depth images and, subsequently, on 3D space. Introducing a non-parametric
representation to encode the temporal correlation among pairs of colorized
depthmaps and 3D optical flow frames, a multi-stage Fully Convolutional Network
(FCN) architecture is proposed to jointly learn reflector locations and their
temporal dependency among sequential frames. The extracted reflector 2D
locations are spatially mapped in 3D space, resulting in robust 3D optical data
extraction. The subject's motion is efficiently captured by applying a
template-based fitting technique on the extracted optical data. Two datasets
have been created and made publicly available for evaluation purposes; one
comprising multi-view depth and 3D optical flow annotated images (DMC2.5D), and
a second, consisting of spatio-temporally aligned multi-view depth images along
with skeleton, inertial and ground truth MoCap data (DMC3D). The FCN model
outperforms its competitors on the DMC2.5D dataset using 2D Percentage of
Correct Keypoints (PCK) metric, while the motion capture outcome is evaluated
against RGB-D and inertial data fusion approaches on DMC3D, outperforming the
next best method by 4.5% in total 3D PCK accuracy.

closed Hamiltonian systems. Due to the energy fluctuations generated by the
noise, the isopotential curves open up and the particles can eventually escape
in finite times. This drastic change in the dynamical behavior turns the
bounded motion into a chaotic scattering problem. We analyze the escape
dynamics by means of the average escape time, the probability basins and the
average escape time distribution. We obtain that the main characteristics of
the scattering are different from the case of noisy open Hamiltonian systems.
In particular, the noise-enhanced trapping, which is ubiquitous in Hamiltonian
systems, does not play the main role in the escapes. On the other hand, one of
our main findings reveals a transition in the evolution of the average escape
time insofar the noise is increased. This transition separates two different
regimes characterized by different algebraic scaling laws. We provide strong
numerical evidence to show that the complete destruction of the stickiness of
the KAM islands is the key reason under the change in the scaling law. This
research unlocks the possibility of modeling chaotic scattering problems by
means of noisy closed Hamiltonian systems. For this reason, we expect potential
application to several fields of physics such us celestial mechanics and
astrophysics, among others.

demand-side flexibility service in distribution networks. Step one applies
optimization-based modelling to propose a generic problem formulation which
determines the offer curve, in terms of available flexible capacity and its
marginal cost, for flexible distribution-connected assets. These offer curves
form an input to the second step, which uses a multi-agent iterative game
framework to determine the benefits of demand-side flexibility for the
Distribution System Operator (DSO) and the service providers. The combined
two-step framework simultaneously accounts for the objectives of each
flexibility provider, technical constraints of flexible assets, customer
preferences, market clearing mechanisms, and strategic bidding by service
providers, omission of any of which can lead to erroneous results. The proposed
two-step framework has been applied to a real case study in the North East of
England to examine four market mechanisms and three bidding strategies. The
results showed that among all considered market mechanisms, flexibility markets
that operate under discriminatory pricing, such as pay-as-bid and Dutch reverse
auctions, are prone to manipulations, especially in the lack of competition. In
contrast, uniform pricing pay-as-cleared auction provides limited opportunities
for manipulation even when competition is low.

2D-xene materials with the addition of momentum relaxation effects, in order to
account for dephasing processes. The topological field effect transition
between the quantum spin Hall phase and the quantum valley Hall phase is
analyzed in detail using the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique
with the inclusion of momentum and phase relaxation, within the self-consistent
Born approximation. Details of the transition with applied electric field are
elucidated for the ON-OFF characteristics with emphasis on the transport
properties along with the tomography of the current carrying edge states. We
note that for moderate momentum relaxation, the current carrying quantum spin
Hall edge states are still pristine and show moderate decay with propagation.
To facilitate our analysis, we introduce two metrics in our calculations, the
coherent transmission and the effective transmission. In elucidating the
physics clearly, we show that the effective transmission, which is derived
rigorously from the quantum mechanical current operator is indeed the right
quantity to analyze topological stability against dephasing. Exploring further,
we show that the insulating quantum valley Hall phase, as a result of dephasing
carries band-tails which potentially activates parasitic OFF currents, thereby
degrading the ON-OFF ratios. Our analysis sets the stage for realistic modeling
of topological field effect devices for various applications, with the
inclusion of scattering effects and analyzing their role in the optimization of
the device performance.

a hierarchical network V$^2$-Net, which contains two sub-networks, to
hierarchically model and predict agents' trajectories with trajectory
spectrums. The coarse-level keypoints estimation sub-network first predicts the
""minimal"" spectrums of agents' trajectories on several ""key"" frequency

All relevant information, the collective expertise, and meta-information around
the code change and its context become evident, transparent, and explicit in
the corresponding code review discussion. The discussion participants can
leverage this information in the following code reviews; the information
diffuses through the communication network that emerges from code review.
Traditional time-aggregated graphs fall short in rendering information
diffusion as those models ignore the temporal order of the information
exchange: Information can only be passed on if it is available in the first
place.
  Aim: This manuscript presents a novel model based on time-varying hypergraphs
for rendering information diffusion that overcomes the inherent limitations of
traditional, time-aggregated graph-based models.
  Method: In an in-silico experiment, we simulate an information diffusion
within the internal code review at Microsoft and show the empirical impact of
time on a key characteristic of information diffusion: the number of reachable
participants.
  Results: Time-aggregation significantly overestimates the paths of
information diffusion available in communication networks and, thus, is neither
precise nor accurate for modelling and measuring the spread of information
within communication networks that emerge from code review.
  Conclusion: Our model overcomes the inherent limitations of traditional,
static or time-aggregated, graph-based communication models and sheds the first
light on information diffusion through code review. We believe that our model
can serve as a foundation for understanding, measuring, managing, and improving
knowledge sharing in code review in particular and information diffusion in
software engineering in general.

reinforcement learning employ a global error signal, which implies the use of
shallow networks. On the other hand, error backpropagation allows the use of
networks with multiple layers. However, precise error backpropagation is
difficult to justify in biologically realistic networks because it requires
precise weighted error backpropagation from layer to layer. In this study, we
introduce a novel network that solves this problem by propagating only the sign
of the plasticity change (i.e., LTP/LTD) throughout the whole network, while
neuromodulation controls the learning rate. Neuromodulation can be understood
as a rectified error or relevance signal, while the top-down sign of the error
signal determines whether long-term potentiation or long-term depression will
occur. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a real
robotic task as proof of concept. Our results show that this paradigm can
successfully perform complex tasks using a biologically plausible learning

covers LLP mass values from 10 GeV up to about one half the Higgs-like boson

(SWIPT) has become a practical and promising solution for connecting and
recharging battery-limited devices, thanks to significant advances in low-power
electronics technology and wireless communications techniques. To realize the
promised potentials, advanced resource allocation design plays a decisive role
in revealing, understanding, and exploiting the intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff
capitalizing on the dual use of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless
charging and communication. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive tutorial
overview of SWIPT from the perspective of resource allocation design. The
fundamental concepts, system architectures, and RF energy harvesting (EH)
models are introduced. In particular, three commonly adopted EH models, namely
the linear EH model, the nonlinear saturation EH model, and the nonlinear
circuit-based EH model are characterized and discussed. Then, for a typical
wireless system setup, we establish a generalized resource allocation design
framework which subsumes conventional resource allocation design problems as
special cases. Subsequently, we elaborate on relevant tools from optimization
theory and exploit them for solving representative resource allocation design
problems for SWIPT systems with and without perfect channel state information
(CSI) available at the transmitter, respectively. The associated technical
challenges and insights are also highlighted. Furthermore, we discuss several
promising and exciting future research directions for resource allocation
design for SWIPT systems intertwined with cutting-edge communication
technologies, such as intelligent reflecting surfaces, unmanned aerial
vehicles, mobile edge computing, federated learning, and machine learning.

data for learning a new task, which is hard to obtain in most real scenarios.
Considering that humans can continually learn new tasks from a handful of
examples, we expect the models also to be able to generalize well on new
few-shot tasks without forgetting the previous ones. In this work, we define
this more challenging yet practical problem as Lifelong Few-shot Language
Learning (LFLL) and propose a unified framework for it based on prompt tuning
of T5. Our framework called LFPT5 takes full advantage of PT's strong few-shot
learning ability, and simultaneously trains the model as a task solver and a
data generator. Before learning a new domain of the same task type, LFPT5
generates pseudo (labeled) samples of previously learned domains, and later
gets trained on those samples to alleviate forgetting of previous knowledge as
it learns the new domain. In addition, a KL divergence loss is minimized to
achieve label consistency between the previous and the current model. While
adapting to a new task type, LFPT5 includes and tunes additional prompt
embeddings for the new task. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
LFPT5 can be applied to various different types of tasks and significantly
outperform previous methods in different LFLL settings.

methods to the typical Machine Learning (ML) setting, which becomes
multi-objective if a model should optimize more than one objective, for
instance in fair machine learning. These works also use Multi-Task Learning
(MTL) problems to benchmark MOO algorithms treating each task as independent

  In this work we show that MTL problems do not resemble the characteristics of
MOO problems. In particular, MTL losses are not competing in case of a
sufficiently expressive single model. As a consequence, a single model can
perform just as well as optimizing all objectives with independent models,
rendering MOO inapplicable. We provide evidence with extensive experiments on
the widely used Multi-Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our results call for new

a spin-orbit interaction. Analysis of the beating character made it possible to
separate the conductance contributions from the two heavy holes subbands split

effective masses and quantum relaxation times have been determined, and then
the energy of the spin-orbit interaction was obtained. The quantum well

triplet extracted by ASTE only includes one opinion of the aspect, but an
aspect in a sentence may have multiple corresponding opinions and one opinion
only provides part of the reason why the aspect has this sentiment, as a

a new task, named Aspect Sentiment Multiple Opinions Triplet Extraction

AGF first extracts aspects, then predicts their opinions and sentiments.
Moreover, with the help of the proposed Sequence Labeling Attention(SLA), AGF
improves the performance of the sentiment classification using the extracted
opinions. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

  Networks","9 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  White-box Adversarial Example (AE) attacks towards Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) have a more powerful destructive capacity than black-box AE attacks in
the fields of AE strategies. However, almost all the white-box approaches lack
interpretation from the point of view of DNNs. That is, adversaries did not
investigate the attacks from the perspective of interpretable features, and few
of these approaches considered what features the DNN actually learns. In this
paper, we propose an interpretable white-box AE attack approach, DI-AA, which
explores the application of the interpretable approach of the deep Taylor
decomposition in the selection of the most contributing features and adopts the
Lagrangian relaxation optimization of the logit output and L_p norm to further
decrease the perturbation. We compare DI-AA with six baseline attacks
(including the state-of-the-art attack AutoAttack) on three datasets.
Experimental results reveal that our proposed approach can 1) attack non-robust
models with comparatively low perturbation, where the perturbation is closer to
or lower than the AutoAttack approach; 2) break the TRADES adversarial training
models with the highest success rate; 3) the generated AE can reduce the robust
accuracy of the robust black-box models by 16% to 31% in the black-box transfer
attack.

propose a confusion-focusing mechanism to address the class-confusion issue.
Our confusion-focusing mechanism is implemented by a two-branch network
architecture. Its baseline branch generates confusing classes, and its FocusNet
branch, whose architecture is flexible, discriminates correct labels from these
confusing classes. We also introduce a novel focus-picking loss function to
improve classification accuracy by encouraging FocusNet to focus on the most
confusing classes. The experimental results validate that our FocusNet is
effective for image classification on common datasets, and that our
focus-picking loss function can also benefit the current neural networks in
improving their classification accuracy.

Experiments: Particle-coated droplets of different mass loading were formed
using a volume addition. Then the prepared droplets were impacted on
superhydrophobic surfaces, and their dynamics were recorded using a high-speed
camera. Findings: We report an intriguing phenomenon where interfacial
fingering instability helps suppress breakage in particle-coated droplets. This
island of breakage suppression, where the droplet maintains its intactness upon
impact, appears within a regime of Weber numbers where droplet breakage is
inevitable. The onset of fingering instability in particle-coated droplets is
observed at much lower impact energy, around two times less than the bare
droplet. The instability is characterized using the rim Bond number. The
instability suppresses breakage because of the higher losses associated with
the formation of stable fingers. Such instability can also be seen in
Leidenfrost surfaces and dust/pollen-covered surfaces, making it useful in many
applications related to self-cleaning.

observed even between two independent light sources through either coherence
optics resulting in phase locking or post-selected measurements such as quantum
beating-based gating. Recently, BS physics regarding quantum features has been
discussed using pure coherence optics based on phase basis superposition of the
BS. Here, we experimentally demonstrate coherent photon bunching on a BS, where
coherent photons come from the same input port. Although the mean values of
both output photons are uniform and equal to each other, the mean value of the
coincidence measurements between two output photons results in the nonclassical
feature of photon bunching at a 50% rate. For this unprecedented result, we
discuss the origin of indistinguishability for this quantum feature using the
wave nature of a photon to understand the role of a BS in quantum mechanics.

challenge, this paper proposes a new solution approach to this MINLP problem by
iterative solving a set of coupled subproblems via the augmented Lagrangian
coordination approach following the philosophy of Multi-disciplinary Design

problem that enables its decomposition into a set of coupled subproblems of
different types: a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) subproblem for

an initial solution for this iterative approach is also proposed so that the
optimization can be performed without the need for a user-defined initial

sequence is optimized with a subsystem-level parametric spacecraft design
model. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, the proposed formulation can
obtain a better solution with a shorter computational time even without

be easily parallelizable and thus is expected to be further advantageous and

understanding the properties and evolution of the intracluster medium (ICM).
However, the ICM is a complex plasma, regularly stirred by mergers and
feedback, with non-negligible bulk and turbulent motions and a non-thermal
pressure component, making it difficult to construct a coherent and
comprehensive picture. To this end, we use the FABLE simulations to investigate
how the hydrostatic mass bias is affected by mergers, turbulence, and feedback.
Following in detail a single, massive cluster we find the bias varies
significantly over cosmic time, rarely staying at the average value found at a
particular epoch. Variations of the bias at a given radius are contemporaneous
with periods where outflows dominate the mass flux, either due to mergers or
interestingly, at high redshift, AGN feedback. The $z=0$ ensemble median mass
bias in FABLE is $\sim\!13$ per cent at $R_\mathrm{500}$ and $\sim\!15$ per
cent at $R_\mathrm{200}$, but with a large scatter in individual values. In
halo central regions, we see an increase in temperature and a decrease in
non-thermal pressure support with cosmic time as turbulence thermalises,
leading to a reduction in the mass bias within $\sim\!0.2 \, R_\mathrm{200}$.
When using a fitted pressure profile, instead of the simulation data, to
estimate the bias, we find there can be significant differences, particularly
at larger radii and higher redshift. We therefore caution over the use of such
fits in future work when comparing with the next generation of X-ray and SZ
observations.

Mover's Distance (WMD). Ostensibly adapted for its interpretability, WMD has

its most interpretable aspect: namely, the word-level distances required for
translating a set of words into another set of words. To address this apparent
gap, we introduce WMDecompose: a model and Python library that 1) decomposes
document-level distances into their constituent word-level distances, and 2)
subsequently clusters words to induce thematic elements, such that useful
lexical information is retained and summarized for analysis. To illustrate its
potential in a social scientific context, we apply it to a longitudinal social
media corpus to explore the interrelationship between conspiracy theories and
conservative American discourses. Finally, because of the full WMD model's high
time-complexity, we additionally suggest a method of sampling document pairs

prefix-tuning was shown to be a plug-and-play method on various text generation

However, sequence labeling tasks invalidate existing plug-and-play methods

of classification to totally reuse the architecture of pre-trained models for
sequence labeling tasks. Specifically, for each task, a label word set is first
constructed by selecting a high-frequency word for each class respectively, and
then, task-specific vectors are inserted into the inputs and optimized to
manipulate the model predictions towards the corresponding label words. As a
result, by simply switching the plugin vectors on the input, a frozen
pre-trained language model is allowed to perform different tasks. Experimental
results on three sequence labeling tasks show that the performance of the
proposed method can achieve comparable performance with standard fine-tuning
with only 0.1\% task-specific parameters. In addition, our method is up to 70

phenomenon over a heated sphere moving vertically downwards in the water.
Unprecedented to the previous analytical studies, this model accounts for the
buoyancy effects while solving the momentum, and energy equations in the vapor
phase to obtain the velocity, and the temperature distribution in terms of the
vapor boundary layer thickness. To calculate the vapor boundary layer thickness
an energy balance is applied at the vapor-liquid interface. The flow of liquid
around the sphere is considered to be governed by the potential theory, and the
energy equation in liquid is then solved for the known velocity distribution.
We find that the vapor boundary layer thickness increases with an increase in
the sphere, and the bulk water temperature, and a decrease in the free stream
velocity. This further results in a decrease in the film boiling heat transfer
coefficient. The present study concludes that at low free stream velocities ($<
0.5$ m/s) buoyancy becomes significant in delaying the separation, and when the
velocity is further reduced the separation angle approaches $180^{\circ}$.

importance for the study of particulate geophysical flows. In this work, the
modelling of sediment transport in the collisional regime is investigated with
a focus on the continuum modelling of the granular flow. For this purpose, a
frictional-collisional approach, combining a Coulomb model with the kinetic
theory of granular gases, is developed. The methodology is based on a
comparison with coupled fluid-discrete simulations, that classical kinetic
theory model fails to reproduce. In order to improve the continuum model, the
fluctuating energy balance is computed in the discrete simulations and
systematically compared with the kinetic theory closure laws. Inter-particle
friction is shown to affect the radial distribution function and to increase
the energy dissipation, in agreement with previous observations in the
literature. Due to saltating particles, whose motion can not be captured by the
kinetic theory, departure from the viscosity and diffusivity laws are observed
in the dilute part of the granular flow. Finally, the quadratic nature of the
drag force is shown to increase the granular fluctuating energy dissipation.
Based on these observations, modifications of the kinetic theory closure laws
are proposed. The modified model reproduces perfectly the discrete simulations
in the entire depth structure of the granular flow. These modifications are
shown to impact the rheological properties of the flow and they make it
possible to recover the {\mu}(I) rheology in the dense regime.

$\mu_f$-Dvoretzky covered \[ \limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{\ell_1
+ \dots + \ell_n}{\ln n}\right)\geq \frac{1}{m_f}. \] Under more restrictive
assumptions on $\{\ell_n\}$ the above result is true if $\dim_H K_f<1$. We next
show that as long as $\{\ell_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ and $f$ satisfy the above

covering can be achieved by changing $f$ on a set of arbitrarily small Lebesgue

multi-marginal optimal transport problems with Coulomb cost. This type of
optimal transport problems arises in quantum physics and plays an important
role in understanding the strongly correlated quantum systems. With a
Monge-like ansatz, the orginal high-dimensional problems are transferred into
mathematical programmings with generalized complementarity constraints, and
thus the curse of dimensionality is surmounted. However, the latter ones are
themselves hard to deal with from both theoretical and practical perspective.
Moreover in the presence of nonconvexity, brute-force searching for global
solutions becomes prohibitive as the problem size grows large. To this end, we
propose a global optimization approach for solving the nonconvex optimization
problems, by exploiting an efficient proximal block coordinate descent local
solver and an initialization subroutine based on hierarchical grid refinements.
We provide numerical simulations on some typical physical systems to show the
efficiency of our approach. The results match well with both theoretical
predictions and physical intuitions, and give the first visualization of
optimal transport maps for some two dimensional systems.

in contrast imaging protocols across clinical centers, in particular in the
time between contrast injection and image acquisition, while access to
multi-center contrast-enhanced image data is limited compared to available

single-domain, single-center deep learning models across new unseen domains and

exhaustive evaluation of deep learning techniques to achieve generalizability
to unseen clinical centers for contrast-enhanced image segmentation. To this

domain adaptation. To demonstrate the potential of domain generalization for

results are obtained based on a multi-center cardiac contrast-enhanced MRI

the solution of such systems is notoriusly challenging. In this manuscript, we
study efficient preconditioners for all-at-once approaches using both an
algebraic and an operator preconditioning framework. We show in particular that
for values of the regularization parameter not too small, the saddle-point

robustness can be recovered by the additional solution of a small linear
system, which however couples all realizations. A mean approximation and a
Chebyshev semi-iterative method are investigated to solve this reduced system.
Our analysis considers a random elliptic partial differential equation whose
diffusion coefficient $\kappa(x,\omega)$ is modeled as an almost surely
continuous and positive random field, though not necessarily uniformly bounded
and coercive. We further provide estimates on the dependence of the
preconditioned system on the variance of the random field. Such estimates
involve either the first or second moment of the random variables $1/\min_{x\in

where $D$ is the spatial domain. The theoretical results are confirmed by
numerical experiments, and implementation details are further addressed.

nearby optically bright QSOs. The objects have been selected from X-ray Galaxy
Catalog Xgal20. It is a catalog of 1172 manually identified and classified
galaxies, obtained as a cross-correlation between the 4XMM-DR9 catalog and the
Hyper-Linked Extragalactic Databases and Archives (HyperLeda) with an X-ray
flux greater than 1E-13 erg/cm^2/s.
  The goal of this work is to characterize the X-ray spectral properties of
selected QSOs in the 0.1 - 10 keV energy band. The majority of the sources (6
out of 11), are classified as radio-quiet QSOs. We studied optical spectra,
hardness ratios and performed X-ray spectral fits for the 10 brighter sources.
In most cases, the power law model with absorption is good enough to simulate
observed continua. Although the details of the spectrum in some sources
significantly complicate the model for fitting. The majority of sources have
steep spectra Gamma > 2.1. Extremely steep photon index 2.4 - 2.5 in our sample
occurs for three radio-loud type I quasars. We detected Fe K-alpha line for two
radio-loud type II quasars. We find no strong evidence for spectral hardening
above 2 keV neither for quasars of type I nor for obscured type II. For each
quasar its type was established both based on the features and details of
observed X-ray spectrum and previous data.

signal is used to quantify the evolution of susceptibilities related to
different modes of distortion (ferroelectric, incommensurate,
antiferrodistortive) as a function of temperature and the results are
critically compared to the predictions of a minimal symmetry-based Landau-like
model with two coupled order parameters (ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive)
and incommensurate order parameter being interpreted as inhomogeneous
polarization. Experimentally, we observe a Curie-Weiss-like linear dependence
of ferroelectric stiffness (inverse of susceptibility related to homogeneous
polarization fluctuations) in the cubic phase down to about 50 K above the
transition to the intermediate phase, where this dependence nearly saturates.
Upon cooling down to the intermediate phase, the maximum of susceptibility
shifts gradually to the non-zero wavevector, where another Curie-Weiss-like
linear stiffness trend is established, but with respect to the incommensurate
order parameter. Symmetry of diffuse scattering distributions indicates an
orthorhombic symmetry of the intermediate phase. A notable temperature
dependence of the constant that describes the energy of polarization
inhomogeneities is observed experimentally, which is in disagreement with the
model expectations. Specifics of this dependence suggest the presence of a
nearly temperature-independent characteristic length scale for inhomogeneities
across several phases. Other differences with the model suggest that the
incommensurate order parameter cannot be straightforwardly identified with
weakly-inhomogeneous ferroelectric polarization.

light instead, using time-domain analysis of speckle patterns at a maximum rate
limited by the frequency of image acquisition. The present work is based on
using a centimeter-sized quartz-powder cavity with an arbitrary shape that is
engineered with very high Lambertian reflectivity. When filled with a coherent
monochromatic photon gas, a statistically isotropic and homogeneous 3D speckle
interference pattern is obtained. A single-mode fiber is then used in
combination with photon number autocorrelation analysis to detect minute
changes of the speckle decorrelation spectrum, caused either by cavity
deformations or fluctuations of the dielectric tensor field inside. The
decorrelation spectrum is acquired over 8 to 10 frequency decades below 100

and the extrinsic instrumental noises. With typically 1700 reflections and an
average photon transit path length of 62m, our 3D stochastic interferometer

ergodic fashion over a six-decade dynamic range with a power noise floor of
4x{10}^{-3} pm^2 which corresponds to 2.7 pm at 1 kHz. The cavity also operates
as a speckle fluctuation amplifier that reveals decorrelation spectra due to
picometric thermal motions of colloids in both single and multiple scattering
regimes with a typical 100-fold sensitivity gain compared to conventional light

conjectural framework describing the behavior of certain quantum knot
invariants under the action of the modular group on their argument. More
precisely, when $J_{K,0}$ denotes the colored Jones polynomial of a knot $K$,
Zagier's modularity conjecture describes the asymptotics of the quotient
$J_{K,0} (e^{2 \pi i \gamma(x)}) / J_{K,0}(e^{2 \pi i x})$ as $x \to \infty$
along rationals with bounded denominators, where $\gamma \in
\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. This problem is most accessible for the
figure-eight knot $4_1$, when the colored Jones polynomial has an explicit
expression in terms of the $q$-Pochhammer symbol. Zagier also conjectured that
the function $h(x) = \log (J_{4_1,0} (e^{2 \pi i x}) / J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i
/x}))$ can be extended to a function on $\mathbb{R}$ which is continuous at
irrationals. In the present paper, we prove Zagier's continuity conjecture for
all irrationals which have unbounded partial quotients in their continued
fraction expansion. In particular, the continuity conjecture holds almost
everywhere on the real line. We also establish a smooth approximation of $h$,
uniform over all rationals, in accordance with the modularity conjecture. As an
application, we find the limit distribution (after a suitable centering and
rescaling) of $\log (J_{4_1,0}(e^{2 \pi i x}))$, when $x$ ranges over all
reduced rationals in $(0,1)$ with denominator at most $N$, as $N \to \infty$,
thereby confirming a conjecture of Bettin and Drappeau.

applications like cancer understanding and treatment or immune synapse
research. The MTAs principle is the following: samples are diluted inside a
fluid going through a microfluidic chamber composed of an array of a large
number of traps. While following the fluid flow, samples can encounter traps
that isolate them or very small group of them from the others. However, it
often appears that many traps stay empty, even after a long time which can
drastically reduce the number of exploitable samples. In this paper we built a
Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) Finite Element Model with a specific
streamlines analysis to investigate how the MTA geometry affects its trapping
efficiency and how it is possible to optimize the MTA geometry in order to
maximize the trapping efficiency. Our results shows that optimization of MTA
trapping efficiency is a complex and non-intuitive process and is about finding
a compromise between combinations of geometric parameters values that can not
be achieved with a purely experimental approach. Streamlines analysis suggests
that the important feature is to deviate the particle trajectories that can be
done with: a diagonal pressure gradient, the use of low hydrodynamic resistance
in strategic zones and with the proximity and size of inlet and outlet
channels. We showed that a MTA's trapping efficiency can be easily increased of
more than 20% with a single parametric approach and more than 30% with a
multi-parametric approach. Finally, such an efficient MTA geometry can also be
obtained introducing irregularities in the trap positions with randomized
translated traps.

simple baseline approach (PARE) in which all sentences of a bag are
concatenated into a passage of sentences, and encoded jointly using BERT. The

(self-)quarantine of symptomatic infectious individuals on disease dynamics. To
this end we depart from using the classic bilinear infection process, but
remain still within the framework of the mass-action assumption. From the
mathematical point of view our model is interesting due to the lack of
continuous differentiability at disease free steady states, which implies also
that the basic reproductive number cannot be computed following established
approaches for certain parameter values. However, we parametrise our
mathematical model using published values from the COVID-19 literature, and
analyse the model simulations. We also contrast model simulations against
publicly available COVID-19 test data focusing on the first wave of the
pandemic during March - July 2020 in the UK. Our simulations indicate that
actual peak case numbers might have been as much as 200 times higher than the
reported positive test cases during the first wave in the UK. We find that very
strong adherence to self-quarantine rules yields (only) a reduction of 22$\%$
of peak numbers and delays the onset of the peak by approximately 30-35 days.
However, during the early phase of the outbreak the impact of (self)-quarantine
is much more significant. We also take into account the effect of a national
lockdown in a simplistic way by reducing the effective susceptible population
size. We find that in case of a 90$\%$ reduction of the effective susceptible
population size, strong adherence to self-quarantine still only yields a 25$\%$
reduction of peak infectious numbers when compared to low adherence. This is
due to the significant number of asymptomatic infectious individuals in the
population.

the entropy $S[\boldsymbol{\eta}]$ of a system of non-interacting fermions

(MACC) where each user is connected to multiple caches in a manner that follows
a generalized combinatorial topology. This topology stands out as it allows for
unprecedented coding gains, even with very modest cache resources. First, we
extend the setting and the scheme presented by Muralidhar et al. to a much more
general topology that supports both a much denser range of users and the
coexistence of users connected to different numbers of caches, all while
maintaining the astounding coding gains, here proven to be exactly optimal,
associated with the combinatorial topology. This is achieved, for this
generalized topology, with a novel information-theoretic converse that we
present here, which establishes, together with the scheme, the exact optimal
performance under the assumption of uncoded placement. We subsequently consider
different connectivity ensembles, including the very general scenario of the
entire ensemble of all possible network connectivities/topologies, where any
user can be connected to any subset of caches arbitrarily. For these settings,
we develop novel converse bounds on the optimal performance averaged over the
ensemble's different connectivities, considering the additional realistic
scenario that the connectivity at delivery time is entirely unknown during
cache placement. This novel analysis of topological ensembles leaves open the
possibility that currently-unknown topologies may yield even higher gains, a
hypothesis that is part of the bigger question of which network topology yields
the most caching gains.

this power spectrum necessarily develops an asymptotic tail proportional to

initial matter distribution. The exponent $-3$ is set only by the number of
spatial dimensions. We derive the complete asymptotic series of the power
spectrum and compare the leading- and next-to-leading-order terms to derive
characteristic scales for the onset of non-linear structure formation,
independent of the cosmological model and the type of dark matter. Combined
with earlier results on the mean-field approximation for including particle
interactions, this asymptotic behaviour is likely to remain valid beyond the
Zel'dovich approximation. Due to their insensitivity to cosmological
assumptions, our results are generally applicable to particle distributions
with positions and momenta drawn from a Gaussian random field. We discuss an
analytically solvable toy model to further illustrate the formation of the

for each node to model its sending and receiving features respectively. We
further develop two steps in our directed GNN model with the first one to
aggregate/update the incoming features of nodes and the second one to
aggregate/update the outgoing features. By imposing the two roles for each
node, the likelihood of a directed edge can be calculated based on the outgoing
embedding of the start node and the incoming embedding of the end node. The
log-likelihood of all edges plays a natural role of regularization for the
proposed model, which can alleviate the over-smoothing problem of the deep
GNNs. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world directed graphs demonstrate
outstanding performances of the proposed model in both node-level and
graph-level tasks.

  Conference 2021",,,,"hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Triangle and other kinematic singularities are very sensitive to the precise
masses and widths of the intervening particles. Therefore, the effect that the
heavy-ion collision medium can have on those masses and widths, as captured by
finite-temperature field theory and reported in the literature, may erase the
singularity from the spectrum if the effect is large enough and the loop
completes before the hot gas freezes out. A very timely example is provided by
the $Z_{cs}(3985)$ structure recently reported by BES-III in a
$(D_s^-D^{*0}+D_s^{*-}D^0)$ spectrum recoiling against a $K^+$. If a new
hadron, this would be a clear exotic $c\bar{c}s\bar{u}$ tetraquark candidate,
the first of a charmonium-like family with strangeness: to accept this,
alternative explanations first need to be tested and discarded. As shown in
figure 1, the mass spectrum recoiling against the kaon is near the
$m_{D_s^{*-}}+m_{D^0}$ threshold, whereas the production cross-section seems to
peak around that for $\sqrt{s(e^-e^+)}=m_{D_{s2}^{*+}} +m_{D_s^{*-}} $.
Therefore, this structure may well be caused by a triangle with the three
charmed mesons $D_{s2}^{*+} / D_s^{*-} / D^0$ running in the loop, with the
amplitude enhanced at the two thresholds. If so, the structure would be erased
from the spectrum in Heavy Ion Collisions, whereas a hadron would continue to
exist although with a mass decreased by a few percent as computed by other
authors.

we tried to evaluate VQE methods with Genetic Algorithms(GA). In this paper, we
propose the VQE method with GA. We selected ground and excited-state energy on
hydrogen molecules as the target because there are many local minimum values on
excited states though the molecular structure is extremely simple. Therefore it
is not easy to find the energy of states. We compared the GA method with other
methods from the viewpoint of log error of the ground, triplet, singlet, and
doubly excited state energy value. As a result, we denoted that the BFGS method
has the highest accuracy. We thought that rcGA used as an optimization for the
VQE method was proved disappointing. The rcGA does not show an advantage
compared to other methods. we suggest that the cause is due to initial
convergence. In the future, we want to try to introduce Genetic Algorithms then

engineering life cycle. Test prioritization is a method that can improve the
efficiency of continuous integration testing by selecting test cases that can
detect faults in the early stage of each cycle. As continuous integration
testing produces voluminous test execution data, test history is a commonly
used artifact in test prioritization. However, existing test prioritization
techniques for continuous integration either cannot handle large test history
or are optimized for using a limited number of historical test cycles. We show
that such a limitation can decrease fault detection effectiveness of
prioritized test suites.
  This work introduces DeepOrder, a deep learning-based model that works on the
basis of regression machine learning. DeepOrder ranks test cases based on the
historical record of test executions from any number of previous test cycles.
DeepOrder learns failed test cases based on multiple factors including the
duration and execution status of test cases. We experimentally show that deep
neural networks, as a simple regression model, can be efficiently used for test
case prioritization in continuous integration testing. DeepOrder is evaluated
with respect to time-effectiveness and fault detection effectiveness in
comparison with an industry practice and the state of the art approaches. The
results show that DeepOrder outperforms the industry practice and
state-of-the-art test prioritization approaches in terms of these two metrics.

law enforcement and national security agencies have argued that the spread of
cryptography has hindered access to evidence and intelligence. Some in industry
and government now advocate a new technology to access targeted data:
client-side scanning (CSS). Instead of weakening encryption or providing law
enforcement with backdoor keys to decrypt communications, CSS would enable
on-device analysis of data in the clear. If targeted information were detected,
its existence and, potentially, its source, would be revealed to the agencies;
otherwise, little or no information would leave the client device. Its
proponents claim that CSS is a solution to the encryption versus public safety
debate: it offers privacy -- in the sense of unimpeded end-to-end encryption --
and the ability to successfully investigate serious crime. In this report, we
argue that CSS neither guarantees efficacious crime prevention nor prevents

serious security and privacy risks for all society while the assistance it can
provide for law enforcement is at best problematic. There are multiple ways in

hairpins with optical tweezers, with a general feedback protocol based on
multiple measurements that includes either discrete-time or continuous-time

it also improves free energy determination (information-to-measurement
conversion). We define thermodynamic information {\Upsilon} as the natural
logarithm of the feedback efficacy, a quantitative measure of the efficiency of
information-to-energy and information-to-measurement conversion in feedback
protocols. We find that discrete and continuous-time feedback reduces
dissipation by roughly kBT{\Upsilon} without improvement in free energy
determination. Remarkably, a feedback strategy (defined as a correlated
sequence of feedback protocols) further reduces dissipation, enhancing
information-to-measurement efficiency. Our study underlines the role of
temporal correlations to develop feedback strategies for efficient

analyze the convergence of the algorithm in the different parameter regions of
the AIM. As no additional approximation is made, the multiloop series for the
local self-energy and response functions converge perfectly to the
corresponding results of the parquet approximation (PA) in the weak- to
intermediate-coupling regime. Small oscillations of the mfRG solution as a
function of the loop order gradually increase with the interaction, hindering a
full convergence to the PA in the strong-coupling regime, where perturbative
resummation schemes are no longer reliable. By exploiting the converged
results, we inspect the fulfillment of (i) sum rules associated to the Pauli
principle and (ii) Ward identities related to conservation laws. For the Pauli
principle, we observe a systematic improvement by increasing the loop order and
including the multiloop corrections to the self-energy. This is consistent with
the preservation of crossing symmetries and two-particle self-consistency in
the PA. For the Ward identities, we numerically confirm a visible improvement
by means of the Katanin substitution. At weak coupling, violations of the Ward
identity are further reduced by increasing the loop order in mfRG. In this
regime, we also determine the precise scaling of the deviations of the Ward
identity as a function of the electronic interaction. For larger interaction
values, the overall behavior becomes more complex, and the benefits of the
higher-loop terms are mostly present in the contributions at large frequencies.

hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution, where the short-distance
constraints associated with the axial anomaly are notoriously difficult to
satisfy in hadronic models. This requires the summation of an infinite tower of
axial vector mesons, which is naturally present in holographic QCD models, and
indeed takes care of the longitudinal short-distance constraint due to Melnikov

models point to larger contributions from axial vector mesons than assumed
previously, while the predicted contributions from pseudo-Goldstone bosons
agree nicely with data-driven approaches.

to that of the non-smoothed estimator with however a slight increase in the

  under Class Imbalance",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classification of large multivariate time series with strong class imbalance
is an important task in real-world applications. Standard methods of class
weights, oversampling, or parametric data augmentation do not always yield
significant improvements for predicting minority classes of interest.
Non-parametric data augmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
offers a promising solution. We propose Imputation Balanced GAN (IB-GAN), a
novel method that joins data augmentation and classification in a one-step
process via an imputation-balancing approach. IB-GAN uses imputation and
resampling techniques to generate higher quality samples from randomly masked
vectors than from white noise, and augments classification through a
class-balanced set of real and synthetic samples. Imputation hyperparameter
$p_{miss}$ allows for regularization of classifier variability by tuning
innovations introduced via generator imputation. IB-GAN is simple to train and
model-agnostic, pairing any deep learning classifier with a
generator-discriminator duo and resulting in higher accuracy for under-observed
classes. Empirical experiments on open-source UCR data and proprietary 90K
product dataset show significant performance gains against state-of-the-art
parametric and GAN baselines.

crystal elastomer (LCE)-based architected material consisting of repeating unit
cells of bistable tilted LCE beams sandwiched between stiff supports.
Viscoelastic behaviors of the LCE material cause the energy absorption to
increase with strain rate according to a power-law relationship, which can be
modulated by changing the degree of mesogens alignment during synthesis. For a
strain rate of 600 s-1, the unit cell structure shows up to a 5 MJ/m3 energy
absorption density, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the same
structure fabricated from Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and is comparable to the
dissipation from irreversible plastic deformation exhibited by denser metals.
For a stacked structure of unit cells, viscoelasticity also produces nonuniform
buckling of the LCE beams, causing the energy absorption density to increase
with the stacking number n up to n=3. Varying the beam geometry further
promotes the nonuniform buckling behavior allowing the energy absorption
density to increase with stacking number without bounds. We envision that our
study can lead to the development of lightweight extreme energy-absorbing
materials.

Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory as a candidate for the medium-sized
telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). CTAO is
currently entering early construction phase of the project and once completed
it will vastly improve very high energy gamma-ray detection component in
multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observations due to significantly improved
sensitivity, angular resolution and field of view comparing to the current
generation of the ground-based gamma-ray observatories H.E.S.S., MAGIC and
VERITAS. The pSCT uses a dual aspheric mirror design with a $9.7$ m primary
mirror and $5.4$ m secondary mirror, both of which are segmented. The
Schwarzschild-Couder (SC) optical system (OS) selected for the prototype
telescope achieves wide field of view of $8$ degrees and simultaneously reduces
the focal plane plate scale allowing an unprecedented compact ($0.78$m
diameter) implementation of the high-resolution camera ($6$mm/ $0.067$deg per
imaging pixel with $11,328$ pixels) based on the silicon photo-multipliers
(SiPMs). The OS of the telescope is designed to eliminate spherical and comatic
aberrations and minimize astigmatism to radically improve off-axis imaging and
consequently angular resolution across all the field of view with respect to
the conventional single-mirror telescopes. Fast and high imaging resolution OS
of the pSCT comes with the challenging submillimeter-precision custom alignment
system, which was successfully demonstrated with an on-axis point spread
function (PSF) of $2.9$ arcmin prior to the first-light detection of the Crab

Therefore, our goal is to find coil configurations that increase construction

paper, we develop a gradient-based stochastic optimization model which seeks
robust stellarator coil configurations in high dimensions. In particular, we
design a two-step method: first, we perform an approximate global search by a
sample efficient trust-region Bayesian optimization; second, we refine the
minima found in step one with a stochastic local optimizer. To this end, we
introduce two stochastic local optimizers: BFGS applied to the Sample Average
Approximation and Adam, equipped with a control variate for variance reduction.
Numerical experiments performed on a W7-X-like coil configuration demonstrate
that our global optimization approach finds a variety of promising local
solutions at less than 0.1% of the cost of previous work, which considered

galaxy mergers. At subparsec separations, they are practically impossible to
resolve, and the most promising technique is to search for quasars with
periodic variability. However, searches for quasar periodicity in time-domain
data are challenging due to the stochastic variability of quasars. In this
paper, we used Bayesian methods to disentangle periodic SMBHB signals from
intrinsic damped random walk (DRW) variability in active galactic nuclei light
curves. We simulated a wide variety of realistic DRW and DRW+sine light curves.
Their observed properties are modeled after the Catalina Real-time Transient
Survey (CRTS) and expected properties of the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space
and Time (LSST) from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Through a careful analysis
of parameter estimation and Bayesian model selection, we investigated the range
of parameter space for which binary systems can be detected. We also examined
which DRW signals can mimic periodicity and be falsely classified as binary
candidates. We found that periodic signals are more easily detectable if the
period is short or the amplitude of the signal is large compared to the
contribution of the DRW noise. We saw similar detection rates both in the CRTS
and LSST-like simulations, while the false-detection rate depends on the
quality of the data and is minimal in LSST. Our idealized simulations provide
an excellent way to uncover the intrinsic limitations in quasar periodicity
searches and set the stage for future searches for SMBHBs.

IGR J18017$-$3542, PBC J1841.1+0138, IGR J18434$-$0508, and Swift J1909.3+0124.
A 311.8 s, coherent optical pulsation is detected from PBC J1841.1+0138, as
well as eclipses with a period of 0.221909 days. A 152.49 s coherent period is

period of 803.5 s in an archival X-ray observation of Swift J0717.8$-$2156. The
latter four objects are thus confirmed magnetic CVs of the intermediate polar

Swift J0820.6$-$2805, which has low and high states differing by $\approx4$
mag, and optical periods or QPOs not in agreement with proposed X-ray periods.
Of note is an unusually long 2.06 day orbital period for Swift J1909.3+0124,
manifest in the radial velocity variation of photospheric absorption lines of
an early K-type companion star. The star must be somewhat evolved if it is to

filters to expand the receptive field patterns and stabilize long continuous
signal generation; and 2) SingGAN introduces global and local discriminators at
different scales to enrich low-frequency details and promote high-frequency

auxiliary spectrogram losses and sub-band feature matching penalty loss. To the
best of our knowledge, SingGAN is the first work designed toward high-fidelity

Furthermore, the reference policy used in the regularization provides an extra

items to users through interactive conversations, has gained great research
interest recently. A CRS is usually composed of a recommendation module and a
generation module. In the previous work, these two modules are loosely
connected in the model training and are shallowly integrated during inference,
where a simple switching or copy mechanism is adopted to incorporate
recommended items into generated responses. Moreover, the current end-to-end
neural models trained on small crowd-sourcing datasets (e.g., 10K dialogs in
the ReDial dataset) tend to overfit and have poor chit-chat ability. In this
work, we propose a novel unified framework that integrates recommendation into
the dialog (RecInDial) generation by introducing a vocabulary pointer. To
tackle the low-resource issue in CRS, we finetune the large-scale pretrained

knowledge-aware bias learned from an entity-oriented knowledge graph to enhance
the recommendation performance. Furthermore, we propose to evaluate the CRS
models in an end-to-end manner, which can reflect the overall performance of
the entire system rather than the performance of individual modules, compared
to the separate evaluations of the two modules used in previous work.
Experiments on the benchmark dataset ReDial show our RecInDial model
significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods. More extensive analyses
show the effectiveness of our model.

analytically and numerically shown to reliably stabilize lattice gauge theories

demonstrate the efficacy of this scheme for nonperturbative errors in analog

distill but the usefulness of bound entangled states has been depicted in
different applications. This article represents a comparative dynamical study
of an open quantum system for one of the bound entangled states proposed by
Bennett et al. The study is conducted under the influence of Heisenberg,
bi-linear bi-quadratic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. During the
study, an auxiliary qutrit interacts with one of the qutrits of the selected
two qutrit bound entangled state through different interactions. The computable
cross-norm or realignment (CCNR) criterion has been used to detect the bound
entanglement of the state and the negativity has been applied to measure the
free entanglement. From this three-fold study it is observed that, although the
auxiliary qutrit plays a significant role during the interaction, the
probability amplitude of the qutrit does not affect the open quantum system.

pathology. Fully-supervised models have already achieved outstanding
performance with dense pixel-level annotations. However, drawing such labels on
the giga-pixel whole slide images is extremely expensive and time-consuming. In
this paper, we use only patch-level classification labels to achieve tissue
semantic segmentation on histopathology images, finally reducing the annotation
efforts. We proposed a two-step model including a classification and a
segmentation phases. In the classification phase, we proposed a CAM-based model
to generate pseudo masks by patch-level labels. In the segmentation phase, we
achieved tissue semantic segmentation by our proposed Multi-Layer
Pseudo-Supervision. Several technical novelties have been proposed to reduce
the information gap between pixel-level and patch-level annotations. As a part
of this paper, we introduced a new weakly-supervised semantic segmentation
(WSSS) dataset for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD-HistoSeg). We conducted several
experiments to evaluate our proposed model on two datasets. Our proposed model
outperforms two state-of-the-art WSSS approaches. Note that we can achieve
comparable quantitative and qualitative results with the fully-supervised
model, with only around a 2\% gap for MIoU and FwIoU. By comparing with manual
labeling, our model can greatly save the annotation time from hours to minutes.

6G networks. Back to Shannon's information theory, the goal of communication
has long been to guarantee the correct reception of transmitted messages
irrespective of their meaning. However, in general, whenever communication
occurs to convey a meaning, what matters is the receiver's understanding of the
transmitted message and not necessarily its correct reconstruction. Hence,
semantic communications introduce a new paradigm: transmitting only relevant
information sufficient for the receiver to capture the meaning intended can
save significant communication bandwidth. Thus, this work explores the
opportunity offered by semantic communications for beyond 5G networks. In
particular, we focus on the benefit of semantic compression. We refer to
semantic message as a sequence of well-formed symbols learned from the
""meaning"" underlying data, which have to be interpreted at the receiver. This
requires a reasoning unit, here artificial, on a knowledge base: a symbolic
knowledge representation of the specific application. Therefore, we present and
detail a novel architecture that enables representation learning of semantic
symbols for effective semantic communications. We first discuss theoretical
aspects and successfully design objective functions, which help learn effective
semantic encoders and decoders. Eventually, we show promising numerical results
for the scenario of text transmission, especially when the sender and receiver
speak different languages.

set of statistical methods based on techniques conventionally used to interpret

spectrally clustering a graph representation of the network's neurons with
edges determined either by network weights or correlations of activations. We
show that these partitionings, even ones based only on weights (i.e. strictly
from non-runtime analysis), reveal groups of neurons that are important and

theoretical method based on linear elastic fracture mechanics merged with
approaches from stochastic geometry to predict the 2D-macro-scale fragmentation
of glass. The approach is based on two influencing parameters of glass: (i)
fragment particle size and (ii) fracture particle intensity, which are related
to the pre-stress induced strain energy density before fracture. Further Finite
Element (FE) analysis of single cylindrical glass particles allow for
establishing functional relations of the glass fragment particle dimensions,
the pre-stress level and the resulting maximum in-plane deformation. Combining
the two parts of two-parameter fracture pattern modelling and FE results on
fragment expansion, formulas and engineering design charts for quantifying the
in-plane expansion of thermally pre-stressed glass panes due to fracturing via
an ETD approach is derived and provided within this paper. Two examples from
engineering practice serve as demonstrators on how to use our ETD approach to
compute the equivalent temperature difference and resulting internal forces as
well as deformations. This approach serves furthermore as a basis to estimate
secondary effects (such as fracture expansion-induced deformations or stresses)
on support structures or remaining parts of glass laminates in form of handy
ETD load cases within analytical as well as FE analysis.

recent years, there have been significant advances in the area. In particular,
for the Brazilian Portuguese (BP) language, there were about 376 hours public
available for ASR task until the second half of 2020. With the release of new
datasets in early 2021, this number increased to 574 hours. The existing
resources, however, are composed of audios containing only read and prepared
speech. There is a lack of datasets including spontaneous speech, which are
essential in different ASR applications. This paper presents CORAA (Corpus of
Annotated Audios) v1. with 290.77 hours, a publicly available dataset for ASR
in BP containing validated pairs (audio-transcription). CORAA also contains
European Portuguese audios (4.69 hours). We also present a public ASR model
based on Wav2Vec 2.0 XLSR-53 and fine-tuned over CORAA. Our model achieved a
Word Error Rate of 24.18% on CORAA test set and 20.08% on Common Voice test
set. When measuring the Character Error Rate, we obtained 11.02% and 6.34% for
CORAA and Common Voice, respectively. CORAA corpora were assembled to both
improve ASR models in BP with phenomena from spontaneous speech and motivate
young researchers to start their studies on ASR for Portuguese. All the corpora

significant costs in damages, as well as large-scale panic and injuries. A
mathematical description of sports riots is therefore sought to better
understand their propagation and limit these physical and financial damages. In
this work, we present an agent-based modelling framework that describes the
qualitative features of populations engaging in riotous behaviour. Agents,
pertaining to either a 'rioter' or a 'bystander' sub-population, move on an
underlying lattice and can either be recruited or defect from their respective
subpopulation. In particular, we allow these individual-level recruitment and
defection processes to vary with local population density. This agent-based
modelling framework provides the unifying link between multi-population
stochastic models and density-dependent reaction processes. Furthermore, the
continuum description of this ABM framework is shown to be a system of
nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations and faithfully agrees with the average
ABM behaviour from individual simulations. Finally, we determine the unique
correspondence between the underlying individual-level recruitment and
defection mechanisms with their population-level counterparts, providing a link
between local-scale effects and macroscale rioting phenomena.

underlying structure of gene-gene interaction networks is investigated so far
according to pair connections. To address this, we explore the gene interaction
networks of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae beyond pairwise interaction
using the structural balance theory (SBT). Specifically, we ask whether
essential and nonessential gene interaction networks are structurally balanced.
We study triadic interactions in the weighted signed undirected gene networks
and observe that balanced and unbalanced triads are over and underrepresented
in both networks, thus beautifully in line with the strong notion of balance.
Moreover, we note that the energy distribution of triads is significantly
different in both essential and nonessential networks compared with the
shuffled networks. Yet, this difference is greater in the essential network
regarding the frequency as well as the energy of triads. Additionally, results
demonstrate that triads in the essential gene network are more interconnected
through sharing common links, while in the nonessential network they tend to be
isolated. Last but not least, we investigate the contribution of all-length
signed walks and its impact on the degree of balance. Our findings reveal that
interestingly when considering longer cycles the nonessential gene network is
more balanced compared to the essential network.

  Edge","14 pages, submitted to Journal of Computer Networks (ComNet) 2022",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technology for
next-generation AI systems that allows a number of workers, i.e., edge devices,
collaboratively learn a shared global model while keeping their data locally to
prevent privacy leakage. Enabling FL over wireless multi-hop networks can
democratize AI and make it accessible in a cost-effective manner. However, the
noisy bandwidth-limited multi-hop wireless connections can lead to delayed and
nomadic model updates, which significantly slows down the FL convergence speed.
To address such challenges, this paper aims to accelerate FL convergence over
wireless edge by optimizing the multi-hop federated networking performance. In
particular, the FL convergence optimization problem is formulated as a Markov
decision process (MDP). To solve such MDP, multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MA-RL) algorithms along with domain-specific action space refining schemes are
developed, which online learn the delay-minimum forwarding paths to minimize
the model exchange latency between the edge devices (i.e., workers) and the
remote server. To validate the proposed solutions, FedEdge is developed and
implemented, which is the first experimental framework in the literature for FL
over multi-hop wireless edge computing networks. FedEdge allows us to fast
prototype, deploy, and evaluate novel FL algorithms along with RL-based system
optimization methods in real wireless devices. Moreover, a physical
experimental testbed is implemented by customizing the widely adopted Linux
wireless routers and ML computing nodes.Finally, our experimentation results on
the testbed show that the proposed network-accelerated FL system can
practically and significantly improve FL convergence speed, compared to the FL
system empowered by the production-grade commercially available wireless
networking protocol, BATMAN-Adv.

Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) require knowledge of full Channel State Information
(CSI). However, the resulting acquisition overhead constitutes a major
bottleneck for the realization of IRS-assisted wireless systems in practice. In
contrast, in this paper, focusing on downlink transmissions from a Base Station
(BS) to a Mobile User (MU) that is located in a blockage region, we propose to
optimize the IRS for illumination of the area centered around the MU. Hence,
the proposed design requires the estimation of the MU's position and not the
full CSI. For a given IRS phase-shift configuration, the end-to-end BS-IRS-MU
channel can then be estimated using conventional channel estimation techniques.
The IRS reconfiguration overhead for the proposed scheme depends on the MU
mobility as well as how wide the coverage of the IRS illumination is.
Therefore, we develop a general IRS phase-shift design, which is valid for both
the near- and far-field regimes and features a parameter for tuning the size of
the illumination area. Moreover, we study a special case where the IRS
illuminates the entire blockage area, which implies that the IRS phase shifts
do not change over time leading to zero overhead for IRS reconfiguration.

  Profile",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stability and protection of the electrical power systems are always of
primary concern. Stability can be affected mostly by increase in the load
demand. Power grids are overloaded in peak hours so more power generation units
are required to cope the demand. Increase in power generation is not an optimal
solution. With the enlargement in Smart grid (SG), it becomes easier to
correlate the consumer demand and available power. The most significant
featutre of smart grid is demand response (DR) which is used to match the
demand of available electrical energy and shift the peak load into off peak
hours to improve the economics of energy and stability of grid stations.
Presently we used Genetic algorithm (GA) to schedule the load via real time
pricing signal (RTP). Load is categorized depending on their energy
requirement, operational constraint and duty cycle. We conclude that GA
provides optimal solution for scheduling of house hold appliances by curtailing
overall utilized energy cost and peak to average ratio hence improving the load
profile.

Indonesian precipitation during the extended boreal summer (May to September).
The MJO is one of the dominant intraseasonal variabilities that influence the
extreme precipitation in the tropics, especially in Indonesia. The episodes of
intense precipitation (95th percentiles) during active MJO phases from
1998-2015 are evaluated using the daily precipitation datasets from the gridded
Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards
Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE) and several station rain gauges. The
boreal summer MJO influences the probability of extreme precipitation,
especially in the west and north parts of Indonesia. The west part experiences
an increase in the probability of extreme precipitation by up to 55\% and 80\%
during phases 2 and 3, respectively. Moreover, the extreme precipitation
probability in the north part increases by up to 40 to 70\% during phases 2 to
4. On the other hand, the influence of MJO is relatively weak in the south and
east parts of Indonesia. The contrast of the precipitation response between the
north and south parts of Indonesia is consistent with the northward movement of
boreal summer MJO.
