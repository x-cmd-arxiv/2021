exoplanets, as it introduces spurious jitter in the data sets and prevents the
correct retrieval of a planetary signal. This is key for M dwarfs, considering
that they manifest high activity levels and are primary targets for present and
future searches of habitable Earth-like planets. Effective filtering of
activity is crucial to achieve the sensitivity required for small planet
detections. Here, we analyse the impact of selecting different line lists for
least-squares deconvolution on the dispersion in our RV data sets, to identify
the line list that most effectively reduces the jitter. We employ optical
observations of the active M dwarf EV Lac collected with ESPaDOnS and NARVAL,
and study two line selection approaches: a parametric one based on line
properties and a randomised algorithm that samples the line combination space.
We test the latter further to find the line list that singles out the activity
signal from other sources of noise, and on AD Leo and DS Leo to examine its
consistency at mitigating jitter for different activity levels. The analysis is
complemented with planetary injection tests. The parametric selection yields a
RV RMS reduction of less than 10%, while the randomised selection a systematic
>50% improvement, regardless of the activity level of the star examined.
Furthermore, if activity is the dominant source of noise, this approach allows
the construction of lists containing mainly activity-sensitive lines, which
could be used to enhance the rotational modulation of the resulting data sets
and determine the stellar rotation period more robustly. Finally, the output
line lists allow the recovery of a synthetic planet (0.3-0.6 MJup on a 10 d
orbit) in the presence of both moderate (20 m/s semi-amplitude) and high (200
m/s) activity levels, without affecting the planet signal substantially.

  306 MeV",,,"10.1103/PhysRevC.102.044606",,"nucl-ex nucl-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Background: Heavy-ion induced two-nucleon transfer reactions are powerful
tools to reveal peculiar aspects of the atomic nucleus, such as pairing
correlations, single-particle and collective degrees of freedom, and more.
Also, these processes are in competition with the direct meson exchange in the
double charge exchange reactions, which have recently attracted great interest
due to their possible connection to neutrinoless double-beta decay. In this
framework, the exploration of two-nucleon transfer reactions in the 20Ne+116Cd
collision at energies above the Coulomb barrier is particularly relevant since
the 116Cd nucleus is a candidate for the double-beta decay. Methods: We
measured the excitation energy spectra and absolute cross sections for the two
reactions using the MAGNEX large acceptance magnetic spectrometer to detect the
ejectiles. We performed direct coupled reaction channels and sequential
distorted wave Born approximation calculations using the double folding S\~ao
Paulo potential to model the initial and final state interactions. The
spectroscopic amplitudes for two- and singleparticle transitions were derived
by different nuclear structure approaches: microscopic large-scale shell model,
interacting boson model-2 and quasiparticle random phase approximation.
Results: The calculations are able to reproduce the experimental cross sections
for both two-neutron and twoproton transfer reactions. The role of couplings
with the inelastic channels are found to be important in the two-proton
transfer case. A competition between the direct and the sequential process is
found in the reaction mechanism. For the two-proton transfer case, the
inclusion of the 1g7/2 and 2d5/2 orbitals in the model space is crucial.

supervised learning approaches and require substantial efforts in producing
pixel-level annotations. Further, such approaches may perform poorly when
applied to unseen image domains. To cope with these limitations, both
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with full source supervision but without
target supervision and semi-supervised learning (SSL) with partial supervision
have been proposed. While such methods are effective at aligning different
feature distributions, there is still a need to efficiently exploit unlabeled
data to address the performance gap with respect to fully-supervised methods.
In this paper we address semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) for semantic
segmentation, where a large amount of labeled source data as well as a small
amount of labeled target data are available. We propose a novel and effective
two-step semi-supervised dual-domain adaptation (SSDDA) approach to address
both cross- and intra-domain gaps in semantic segmentation. The proposed
framework is comprised of two mixing modules. First, we conduct a cross-domain
adaptation via an image-level mixing strategy, which learns to align the
distribution shift of features between the source data and target data. Second,
intra-domain adaptation is achieved using a separate student-teacher network
which is built to generate category-level data augmentation by mixing unlabeled
target data in a way that respects predicted object boundaries. We demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two common
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks. An extensive ablation study
is provided to further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

as a continuous decision boundary. While O-Nets are significantly more memory
efficient than 3D CNNs, they are limited to simple shapes, are relatively slow
at inference, and have not yet been adapted for 3D semantic segmentation of

build upon the original O-Net with modifications for increased expressiveness

modifications for faster inference. We leverage local observations to represent

OSS-Net's performance on 3D brain tumour and liver segmentation against a
function space baseline (O-Net), a performance baseline (3D residual U-Net),

results similar to the performance baseline and superior to the function space

comparable amounts of memory as the function space baseline, somewhat more
memory than the efficiency baseline and significantly less than the performance
baseline. As such, OSS-Net enables memory-efficient and accurate 3D semantic

the reconstructions of TESS photometry, we produce an activity model, which
reduces the rms scatter in RVs obtained with EXPRES from 4.72 m s$^{-1}$ to

start with the observation that different variants of the V1 model show gains
for specific corruption types. We then build a new model using an ensembling

understanding and development of solar physics, planetary dynamics and
controlled nuclear fusion. Dynamical properties of the MHD system involve
nonlinear interactions of waves with multiple travelling speeds (the fast and
slow magnetosonic waves, the Alfv\'{e}n wave and the entropy wave). One
intriguing topic is the shock phenomena accompanied by the magnetic field,
which have been affirmed by astronomical observations. However, permitting the
residence of all above multi-speed waves, mathematically, whether one can prove
shock formation for 3D MHD is still open. The multiple-speed nature of the MHD
system makes it fascinating and challenging. In this paper, we give an
affirmative answer to the above question. For 3D ideal compressible MHD, we
construct examples of shock formation allowing the presence of all
characteristic waves with multiple wave speeds. Building on our construction,
we further prove that the Cauchy problem for 3D ideal MHD is $H^2$ ill-posed.
And this is caused by the instantaneous shock formation. In particular, when
the magnetic field is absent, we also provide a desired low-regularity
ill-posedness result for the 3D compressible Euler equations, and it is sharp
with respect to the regularity of the fluid velocity. Our proof for 3D MHD is
based on a coalition of a carefully designed algebraic approach and a geometric
approach. To trace the nonlinear interactions of various waves, we
algebraically decompose the 3D ideal MHD equations into a $7\times 7$
non-strictly hyperbolic system. Via detailed calculations, we reveal its hidden
subtle structures. With them we give a complete description of MHD dynamics up
to the earliest singular event, when a shock forms.

the transition temperature down to room-temperature (300 K) whilst maintaining
a sharp transition in temperature, opening the door to the use of
Fe$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$ in functional devices. Crystallographic analysis through
Rietveld refinement of high-resolution x-ray diffraction data has showed that
arc-melted stoichiometric Fe$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$ is multi-phase regardless of
annealing temperature with a minor phase of FeGa$_{3}$ decreasing in phase
fraction at higher annealing temperature. In order to validate the trend in
ISDW-FM transition temperature with regard to unit cell volume, high pressure
magnetometry was performed. This showed that the FM-ISDW ($\sim$ 68 K) and
ISDW-FM ($\sim$ 360 K) transition temperatures could be tuned, increased and
decreased respectively, linearly with external pressure. Thus, external
pressure and the ensuing crystallographic changes minimize the temperature
range of the stability of the ISDW pointing toward the importance of structural
properties on the mechanism for the formation of the intermediate ISDW phase.
These results show how this model system can be tuned as well as highlighting
the need for future high-pressure crystallography and related single crystal
measurements to understand the mechanism and nature of the intermediate ISDW
phase to be exploited in future devices.

accommodate heterogeneous preferences. Due to the nonparametric nature of our

alternatives are presented to the decision makers as a list that correlates
with both heterogeneous preferences and random attention. We show that
preference and attention frequencies are (point or partially) identifiable

our identification results, for both preference and attention frequencies, we
develop econometric methods for estimation and inference that are valid in

DNS, we assess the abilities of the data assimilation methodology in improving
the unsteady URANS predictions. While improving the low-frequency oscillations
of the wake flow, we also demonstrate the ability to recover the high-frequency

of reference data is systematically investigated. The data resolution which is
required to improve the prediction of flow structures of interest is related to
their wavelength. Using a spacing of the order of one cylinder length between

accuracy in terms of mean flow prediction of URANS is achieved. Using spacing

coherent sets. They are obtained from the spectral clustering of trajectories
of massless fluid tracers that are advected in the flow. Coherent sets result
from trajectories that stay closely together under the dynamics of the
turbulent flow. For longer times, they are always destroyed by the intrinsic
turbulent dispersion of material transport. Here, this constraint is overcome
by the application of evolutionary clustering algorithms that add a time memory
to the coherent set detection and allow individual trajectories to leak in or
out of evolving clusters. Evolutionary clustering thus also opens the
possibility to monitor the splits and mergers of coherent sets. These rare
dynamic events leave clear footprints in the evolving eigenvalue spectrum of
the Laplacian matrix of the trajectory network in both convection flows. The
Lagrangian trajectories reveal the individual pathways of convective heat
transfer across the fluid layer. We identify the long-term coherent sets as
those fluid flow regions that contribute least to heat transfer. Thus, our
evolutionary framework defines a complementary perspective on the slow dynamics
of turbulent superstructure patterns in convection flows that were recently
discussed in the Eulerian frame of reference. The presented framework might be
well suited for studies in natural flows which are typically based on sparse
information from drifters and probes.

autonomously (mimicking human behavior), with the aims to influence the

As socialbots undermine the ecosystem of social platforms, they are often
considered harmful. As such, there have been several computational efforts to
auto-detect the socialbots. However, to our best knowledge, the adversarial
nature of these socialbots has not yet been studied. This begs a question ""can
adversaries, controlling socialbots, exploit AI techniques to their advantage?""
To this question, we successfully demonstrate that indeed it is possible for
adversaries to exploit computational learning mechanism such as reinforcement
learning (RL) to maximize the influence of socialbots while avoiding being
detected. We first formulate the adversarial socialbot learning as a
cooperative game between two functional hierarchical RL agents. While one agent
curates a sequence of activities that can avoid the detection, the other agent
aims to maximize network influence by selectively connecting with right users.
Our proposed policy networks train with a vast amount of synthetic graphs and
generalize better than baselines on unseen real-life graphs both in terms of
maximizing network influence (up to +18%) and sustainable stealthiness (up to
+40% undetectability) under a strong bot detector (with 90% detection
accuracy). During inference, the complexity of our approach scales linearly,
independent of a network's structure and the virality of news. This makes our
approach a practical adversarial attack when deployed in a real-life setting.

composed of inherently complex, non-homogeneous, and dynamic layers. A detailed
understanding of the physical processes involved in these layers is still
lacking. For example, it is largely unknown why the outermost layer of the
Sun's atmosphere (the solar corona) is so much hotter than the photosphere by
millions of degrees. Astrophysicists think that the layer sandwiched between
the photosphere and the corona, known as the interface region, may hold the key
to a better understanding of the nature of this enigma. With the help of
coordinated high-resolution, ground- and space-based observations from the
Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) on La Palma, Spain, and NASA's Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), along
with the support from an advanced numerical simulation, I aim to unlock some of
the mysteries surrounding the dynamics of the interface region with a focus on
small-scale jets, known as ""spicules"". Spicules are found almost everywhere on
the Sun's surface and at any given moment there can be as many as 10 million of
them rapidly shooting outwards. They are often found to be heated beyond
chromospheric temperatures and appear in the transition region and (even)
coronal passbands. Because of their ""omnipresence"", it is suggested that they
play a major role in energizing the outer atmospheric layers of the Sun. This
thesis focuses on the physical characteristics and dynamics of spicules, along
with their role in mass-balance and heating of the solar atmosphere.

involves sudden changes in pulsation mode and nulling occurring on timescales

quasi-regular, which has hampered their interpretation for decades. Here I show
that the pseudo-chaotic complexity of single pulses is caused by the viewing of
a relatively simple radio beam that has a sector structure traceable to the
magnetospheric charge distribution. The slow ExB drift of the sector beam, when
sampled by the line of sight, produces the classical drift-period-folded
patterns known from observations. The drifting azimuthal zones of the beam
produce the changes in pulsation modes and both the intermodal and sporadic
nulling at timescales of beating between the drift and the star spin. The
axially symmetric conal beams are thus a superficial geometric illusion, and
the standard carousel model of pulsar radio beams does not apply. The beam
suggests a particle flow structure that involves inward motions with possible
inward emission.

raised the question of whether or not these devices will find commercial use.
Unfortunately, a major shortcoming of many proposed NISQ-amenable algorithms,
such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), is coming into view: the
algorithms require too many independent quantum measurements to solve practical
problems in a reasonable amount of time. This motivates the central question of
our work: how might we speed up such algorithms in spite of the impact of error
on NISQ computations? We demonstrate on quantum hardware that the estimation of
expectation values, a core subroutine of many quantum algorithms including VQE,
can be improved in terms of precision and accuracy by using a technique we call
Robust Amplitude Estimation. Consequently, this method reduces the runtime to
achieve the same mean-squared error compared to the standard
prepare-and-measure estimation method. The surprising result is that by using
deeper, and therefore more error-prone, quantum circuits, we realize more
accurate quantum computations in less time. As the quality of quantum devices
improves, this method will provide a proportional reduction in estimation
runtime. This technique may be used to speed up quantum computations into the
regime of early fault-tolerant quantum computation and aid in the realization
of quantum advantage.

instead, the operator is defined on the Hilbert space of a fixed cubical graph.
The starting point of our work is to write the spatial Ricci scalar classically
as a function of the densitized triad and its SU(2)-covariant derivatives. We
pass from the classical expression to a quantum operator through a
regularization procedure, in which covariant derivatives of the triad are
discretized as finite differences of gauge covariant flux variables on the
cubical lattice provided by the graph. While more work is needed in order to
extend our construction to encompass states based on all possible graphs, the
operator presented here can be applied in models such as quantum-reduced loop
gravity and effective dynamics, which are derived from the kinematical
framework of full loop quantum gravity, and are formulated in terms of states
defined on cubical graphs.

train the algorithms on the Equivalent Width (EW) of characteristic absorption
lines (features) measured in high-quality spectra from large Galactic
(LAMOST,GOSSS) and extragalactic surveys (2dF,VFTS) with available
spectral-types and luminosity classes. We find that the overall accuracy score
is $\sim$70% with similar results across all approaches. We show that the full
set of 17 spectral lines is needed to reach the maximum performance per
spectral class. We apply our model in other observational data sets providing
examples of potential application of our classifier on real science cases. We
find that it performs well for both single massive stars and for the companion
massive stars in Be X-ray binaries. In addition, we propose a reduced
10-features scheme that can be applied to large data sets with lower S/N. The
similarity in the performances of our models indicates the robustness and the
reliability of the RF algorithm when it is used for the spectral classification
of early-type stars. The score of $\sim$70% is high if we consider (a) the
complexity of such multi-class classification problems, (b) the intrinsic
scatter of the EW distributions within the examined spectral classes, and (c)
the diversity of the training set since we use data obtained from different
surveys with different observing strategies. In addition, the approach
presented in this work, is applicable to data of different quality and of
different format (e.g.,absolute or normalized flux) while our classifier is
agnostic to the Luminosity Class of a star and, as much as possible,

work. By numerical computations, we explicitly find curved Regge geometries
from the large-$j$ Lorentzian Engle-Pereira-Rovelli-Livine (EPRL) spinfoam

angles and relate to the complex critical points of the amplitude. The dominant
contribution from the curved geometry to the spinfoam amplitude is proportional
to $e^{i \mathcal{I}}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is the Regge action of the geometry
plus corrections of higher order in curvature. As a result, the spinfoam
amplitude reduces to an integral over Regge geometries weighted by $e^{i

provides a mechanism to relax the cosine problem in the spinfoam model. Our
results provide important evidence supporting the semiclassical consistency of

metallic structure into meaningful chemical neighborhoods allowing for
localization of energy-dependent properties. The generalizability of this
approach is assessed by determining neighborhoods for crystalline materials of
different structure types, and significant structural defects such as grain
boundaries and dislocations. In all cases, we observe that the neighborhood

of near and long-term quantum computers. The best-known heuristic quantum
algorithm for combinatorial optimization on gate-based devices, the Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), has been the subject of many
theoretical and empirical studies. Unfortunately, its application to specific
combinatorial optimization problems poses several difficulties: among these,
few performance guarantees are known, and the variational nature of the
algorithm makes it necessary to classically optimize a number of parameters. In
this work, we partially address these issues for a specific combinatorial
optimization problem: diluted spin models, with MAX-CUT as a notable special
case. Specifically, generalizing the analysis of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
model by Farhi et al., we establish an explicit algorithm to evaluate the
performance of QAOA on MAX-CUT applied to random Erdos-Renyi graphs of expected
degree $d$ for an arbitrary constant number of layers $p$ and as the problem
size tends to infinity. This analysis yields an explicit mapping between QAOA
parameters for MAX-CUT on Erdos-Renyi graphs of expected degree $d$, in the
limit $d \to \infty$, and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, and gives good
QAOA variational parameters for MAX-CUT applied to Erdos-Renyi graphs. We then
partially generalize the latter analysis to graphs with a degree distribution
rather than a single degree $d$, and finally to diluted spin-models with
$D$-body interactions ($D \geq 3$). We validate our results with numerical
experiments suggesting they may have a larger reach than rigorously
established; among other things, our algorithms provided good initial, if not
nearly optimal, variational parameters for very small problem instances where
the infinite-size limit assumption is clearly violated.

Epoch of Reionization is an emerging tool to constrain their role in
reionization. Ongoing and upcoming experiments target the signal fluctuations
across the sky to reveal statistical and astrophysical properties of these
galaxies via signal statistics, e.g., the power spectrum. Here, we revisit the
[C II]$_{158 \mu \text{m}}$ LIM power spectrum under non-uniform
line-luminosity scatter, which has a halo-mass variation of statistical
properties. Line-luminosity scatter from a cosmological hydrodynamic and
radiative transfer simulation of galaxies at $z=6$ is considered in this study.
We test the robustness of different model frameworks that interpret the impact
of the line-luminosity scatter on the signal statistics. We use a simple
power-law model to fit the scatter and demonstrate that the mean
luminosity-halo mass correlation fit cannot preserve the mean intensity of the
LIM signal (hence the clustering power spectrum) under non-uniform scatter. In
our case, the mean intensity changes by $\sim 48$ per cent compared to the mean
correlation fit in contrast to the general case with semi-analytic scatter.
However, we find that the prediction for the mean intensity from the
most-probable fit can be modelled robustly, considering the generalized and
more realistic non-uniform scatter. We also explore the possibility of
diminishing luminosity bias under non-uniform scatter, affecting the clustering
power spectrum, although this phenomenon might not be statistically
significant. Therefore, we should adopt appropriate approaches that can
consistently interpret the LIM power spectrum from observations.

lower-dimensional worldvolume can be interpreted in a number of ways. The first
scenario, Type I, requires a mathematically consistent Kaluza-Klein style
truncation down to a theory in the lower dimension, in which case solutions
purely within that reduced theory exist. However, that situation is not a
genuine localisation of gravity because all such solutions have
higher-dimensional source extensions according to the Kaluza-Klein ansatz.
Also, there is no meaningful notion of Newton's constant for such Type I
constructions.
  Types II and III admit coupling to genuinely localised sources in the
higher-dimensional theory, with corresponding solutions involving full sets of
higher-dimensional modes. Type II puts no specific boundary conditions near the
worldvolume aside from regularity away from sources. In a case where the wave
equation separated in the non-compact space transverse to the worldvolume
admits a normalisable zero mode, the Type III scenario requires boundary
conditions near the worldvolume that permit the inclusion of that zero mode in
mode expansions for gravitational wave fluctuations or potentials. In such a
case, an effective theory of lower-dimensional gravity can emerge at
sufficiently large worldvolume distance scales.
  This taxonomy of brane gravity localisations is developed in detail for
linearised perturbations about a background incorporating the vacuum solution
of Salam-Sezgin theory when embedded into ten-dimensional supergravity with a
hyperbolic non-compact transverse space. Interpretations of the Newton constant

broadly motivated by hidden naturalness arguments. The dark quarks couple to
the Standard Model via irrelevant $Z$- and Higgs-portal operators, which encode
the low-energy effects of TeV-scale fermions interacting through Yukawa
couplings with the Higgs field. The dark pions, depending on their $CP$
properties, behave as either composite axion-like particles (ALPs) mixing with
the $Z$ or scalars mixing with the Higgs. The dark pion lifetimes fall
naturally in the most interesting region for present and proposed searches for

of $Z$ and Higgs bosons to hidden hadrons, and the TeV-scale signals of the
ultraviolet theory. New constraints are derived from $B$ decays at CMS and from

crystalline material, the number of electrons per unit cell, to the volume,
enclosed by its Fermi surface, which defines its low-energy observable
properties. Such statements are valuable since, in general, deducing a
low-energy description from microscopics, which may perhaps be regarded as the
main problem of condensed matter theory, is far from easy. In this paper we
present a unified framework, which allows one to discuss Luttinger theorems for
ordinary metals, as well as closely analogous exact statements for topological
(semi)metals, whose low-energy description contains either discrete point or
continuous line nodes. This framework is based on the 't Hooft anomaly of the
emergent charge conservation symmetry at each point on the Fermi surface, a
concept recently proposed by Else, Thorngren and Senthil [Phys. Rev. X 11,
021005 (2021)]. We find that the Fermi surface codimension $p$ plays a crucial
role for the emergent anomaly. For odd $p$, such as ordinary metals ($p=1$) and
magnetic Weyl semimetals ($p=3$), the emergent symmetry has a generalized
chiral anomaly. For even $p$, such as graphene and nodal line semimetals (both
with $p=2$), the emergent symmetry has a generalized parity anomaly. When
restricted to microscopic symmetries, such as $U(1)$ and lattice symmetries,
the emergent anomalies imply (generalized) Luttinger theorems, relating Fermi
surface volume to various topological responses. The corresponding topological
responses are the charge density for $p=1$, Hall conductivity for $p=3$, and
polarization for $p=2$. As a by-product of our results, we clarify exactly what
is anomalous about the surface states of nodal line semimetals.

rapid accretion phase lasts until a good fraction of the gas bounded within the

strong outflows driven by ionizing radiation emitted from the accreting BH. The
transient growing mode can be triggered for seed BHs formed in massive

due to the dearth of HII regions in these galaxies, rather than a lack of
higher-order variation. After subtracting a linear radial gradient, we see no
enrichment in the spiral arms versus the disc. We measure the 50 per cent
correlation scale from the two-point correlation function of these
radially-subtracted maps, finding it to typically be an order of magnitude
smaller than the fitted GPR kernel scale length. We study the dependence of the
two-point correlation scale length with a number of global galaxy properties.
We find no relationship between the 50 per cent correlation scale and the
overall gas turbulence, in tension with existing theoretical models. We also
find more actively star forming galaxies, and earlier type galaxies have a
larger 50 per cent correlation scale. The size and stellar mass surface density
do not appear to correlate with the 50 per cent correlation scale, indicating
that perhaps the evolutionary state of the galaxy and its current star

phenomenology of an ALP with flavor-changing couplings, and present a
comprehensive analysis of quark and lepton flavor-changing observables within a
general ALP effective field theory. Observables studied include rare meson
decays, flavor oscillations of neutral mesons, rare lepton decays, and dipole
moments. We derive bounds on the general ALP couplings as a function of its
mass, consistently taking into account the ALP lifetime and branching ratios.
We further calculate quark flavor-changing effects that are unavoidably induced
by running and matching between the new physics scale and the scale of the
measurements. This allows us to derive bounds on benchmark ALP models in which
only a single (flavorless or flavor-universal) ALP coupling to SM particles is
present at the new physics scale, and in this context we highlight the
complementarity and competitiveness of flavor bounds with constraints derived
from collider, beam dump and astrophysical measurements. We find that searches
for ALPs produced in meson decays provide some of the strongest constraints in
the MeV-GeV mass range, even for the most flavorless of ALP models. Likewise,
we discuss the interplay of flavor-conserving and flavor-violating couplings of
the ALP to leptons, finding that constraints from lepton flavor-violating
observables generally depend strongly on both. Additionally, we analyze whether
an ALP can provide an explanation for various experimental anomalies including
those observed in rare B-meson decays, measurements at the ATOMKI and KTeV

some cases they suffer from a sign problem, leading to an exponential slow down

NP-hard, many techniques exist for mitigating the sign problem in specific
cases; in particular, the technique of deforming the Monte Carlo simulation's
plane of integration onto Lefschetz thimbles (complex hypersurfaces of
stationary phase) has seen significant success in the context of quantum field
theories. We extend this methodology to spin systems by utilizing spin coherent
state path integrals to re-express the spin system's partition function in
terms of continuous variables. Using some toy systems, we demonstrate its
effectiveness at lessening the sign problem in this setting, despite the fact
that the initial mapping to spin coherent states introduces its own sign
problem. The standard formulation of the spin coherent path integral is known
to make use of uncontrolled approximations; despite this, for large spins they
are typically considered to yield accurate results, so it is somewhat
surprising that our results show significant systematic errors. Therefore,
possibly of independent interest, our use of Lefschetz thimbles to overcome the
intrinsic sign problem in spin coherent state path integral Monte Carlo enables
a novel numerical demonstration of a breakdown in the spin coherent path

giant members of the relatively high-metallicity globular cluster (GC)
Tononzintla~2 (Ton~2) using high-resolution near-infrared spectra collected
with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment II survey
(APOGEE-2), obtained as part of the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey. We investigate
chemical abundances for a variety of species including the light-, odd-Z,
$\alpha$-, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements from high S/N spectra of seven
giant members. The derived mean cluster metallicity is [Fe/H]$=-0.70\pm0.05$,
with no evidence for an intrinsic metallicity spread. Ton~2 exhibits a typical
$\alpha$-enrichment that follows the trend for high-metallicity Galactic GCs,
similar to that seen in 47~Tucanae and NGC~6380. We find a significant nitrogen
spread ($>0.87$ dex), and a large fraction of nitrogen-enriched stars that
populate the cluster. Given the relatively high-metallicity of Ton~2, these
nitrogen-enriched stars are well above the typical Galactic levels, indicating
the prevalence of the multiple-population phenomenon in this cluster which also
contains several stars with typical low, first-generation N abundances. We also
identify the presence of [Ce/Fe] abundance spread in Ton~2, which is correlated
with the nitrogen enhancement, indicating that the \textit{s}-process
enrichment in this cluster has been produced likely by relatively low-mass
Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. Furthermore, we find a mean radial velocity of
the cluster, $-178.6\pm0.86$ km s$^{-1}$ with a small velocity dispersion,
2.99$\pm$0.61 km s$^{-1}$, which is typical of a GC. We also find a prograde
bulge-like orbit for Ton~2 that appears to be radial and highly eccentric.

from a few Myr to a Gyr. We present spectroscopic transit observations of the

and LBT/PEPSI, and detected the radial velocity anomaly due to the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. V1298 Tau~b has a prograde, well-aligned orbit,
with $\lambda = 4_{-10}^{+7 \circ}$. By combining the
spectroscopically-measured $v\sin i_{\star}$ and the phtometrically-measured
rotation period of the host star we also find that the orbit is aligned in 3D,
$\psi = 8_{-7}^{+4 \circ}$ deg. Finally, we combine our obliquity constraints
with a previous measurement for the interior planet V1298 Tau c to constrain
the mutual inclination between the two planets to be
$i_{\mathrm{mut}}=0^{\circ} \pm 19^{\circ}$. This measurements adds to the
growing number of well-aligned planets at young ages, hinting that
misalignments may be generated over timescales of longer than tens of Myr. The
number of measurements, however, is still small, and this population may not be

procedures to determine aperture corrections, a standard step in the production
of star cluster candidate catalogs, and compare to prior work. We also use this
specialized sample to launch an analysis into the measurement of star cluster
light profiles. We focus on one measure, $M_{20}$ (normalized second order
moment of the brightest 20% of pixels), applied previously to study the
morphologies of galaxies. We find that $M_{20}$ in combination with UB-VI
colors, yields a parameter space where distinct loci are formed by
single-peaked symmetric clusters, single-peaked asymmetric clusters, and
multi-peaked associations. We discuss the potential applications for using
$M_{20}$ to gain insight into the formation and evolution of clusters and
associations. Finally, we compare the color distributions of this sample with
various synthetic stellar population models. One finding is that the standard
procedure of using a single-metallicity SSP track to fit the entire population
of clusters in a given galaxy should be revisited, as the oldest globular
clusters will be more metal-poor compared to clusters formed recently.

when the mediator mass is between one to two orders of magnitude larger than

of including these contributions in such dark matter freeze-in studies. We also
discuss the collider phenomenology of the heavy mediators, which is
qualitatively different from standard freeze-in scenarios. We highlight that,
due to the low TRH, the Standard Model-dark matter coupling in these scenarios

growing rapidly and are reshaping power systems. To promote DERs,
feed-in-tariff (FIT) is usually adopted by utilities to pay DER owners certain
fixed rates for supplying energy to the grid. An alternative to FIT is a
market-based approach; that is, consumers and DER owners trade energy in an
auction-based peer-to-peer (P2P) market, and the rates are determined based on
supply and demand. However, the auction complexity and market participants'
bounded rationality may invalidate many well-established theories on auction
design and hinder market development. To address the challenges, we propose an
automated bidding framework based on multi-agent, multi-armed bandit learning
for repeated auctions, which aims to minimize each bidder's cumulative regret.
Numerical results indicate convergence of such a multi-agent learning game to a
steady-state. Being particularly interested in auction designs, we have applied
the framework to four different implementations of repeated double-side
auctions to compare their market outcomes. While it is difficult to pick a
clear winner, $k$-double auction (a variant of uniform pricing auction) and

instability and we study the dynamics close to the onset of this instability.
First, we show that periodic traveling waves bifurcate from a homogeneous

instability, we construct modulating traveling fronts, which capture the
process of pattern-formation by modeling the transition from the homogeneous
ground state to the periodic traveling wave through an invading front. The
existence proof is based on center manifold reduction to a finite-dimensional
system. Here, the dimension of the center manifold depends on the relation
between the spreading speed of the invading modulating front and the linear
group velocities of the system. Due to the broken reflection symmetry, the
coefficients in the reduced equation are genuinely complex. Therefore, the main
challenge is the construction of persistent heteroclinic connections on the

mishap-free operation will confirm one's confidence in its safety and allow
progressively more extensive operation: a process of ""bootstrapping"" of

way to monitor individuals' health statuses and deliver just-in-time
personalized interventions. However, the practical use of mHealth technology
raises unique challenges to existing methodologies on learning an optimal
dynamic treatment regime. Many mHealth applications involve decision-making
with large numbers of intervention options and under an infinite time horizon
setting where the number of decision stages diverges to infinity. In addition,
temporary medication shortages may cause optimal treatments to be unavailable,
while it is unclear what alternatives can be used. To address these challenges,
we propose a Proximal Temporal consistency Learning (pT-Learning) framework to
estimate an optimal regime that is adaptively adjusted between deterministic
and stochastic sparse policy models. The resulting minimax estimator avoids the
double sampling issue in the existing algorithms. It can be further simplified
and can easily incorporate off-policy data without mismatched distribution
corrections. We study theoretical properties of the sparse policy and establish
finite-sample bounds on the excess risk and performance error. The proposed
method is provided in our proximalDTR package and is evaluated through
extensive simulation studies and the OhioT1DM mHealth dataset.

major hurdles in the adoption of deep learning techniques for solving
physics-based problems: 1) requirement of the large dataset for training the DL
model, 2) consistency of the DL model with the physics of the phenomenon. The
framework is generic in nature and can be applied to model a phenomenon from
other fields of research too as long as its behaviour is known. To demonstrate
the technique, a semi-supervised physics guided neural network (SPGNN) has been
developed that predicts I-V characteristics of a gallium nitride-based high
electron mobility transistor (GaN HEMT). A two-stage training method is
proposed, where in the first stage, the DL model is trained via the
unsupervised learning method using the I-V equations of a field-effect
transistor as a loss function of the model that incorporates physical behaviors
in the DL model and in the second stage, the DL model has been fine-tuned with
a very small set of experimental data. The SPGNN significantly reduces the
requirement of the training data by more than 80% for achieving similar or
better performance than a traditional neural network (TNN) even for unseen
conditions. The SPGNN predicts 32.4% of the unseen test data with less than 1%
of error and only 0.4% of the unseen test data with more than 10% of error.

$\vec{k} = (k_1,\ldots,k_m)$ whose entries sum of up $n$, the
$\vec{k}$-multi-slice is the set of vectors $x\in [m]^n$ in which each symbol
$i\in [m]$ appears precisely $k_i$ times. We show an invariance principle for
low-degree functions over the multi-slice, to functions over the product space
$([m]^n,\mu^n)$ in which $\mu(i) = k_i/n$. This answers a question raised by
Filmus et al.
  As applications of the invariance principle, we show:
  1. An analogue of the ""dictatorship test implies computational hardness""
paradigm for problems with perfect completeness, for a certain class of
dictatorship tests. Our computational hardness is proved assuming a recent
strengthening of the Unique-Games Conjecture, called the Rich $2$-to-$1$ Games
Conjecture. Using this analogue, we show that assuming the Rich $2$-to-$1$
Games Conjecture, (a) there is an $r$-ary CSP $\mathcal{P}_r$ for which it is
NP-hard to distinguish satisfiable instances of the CSP and instances that are
at most $\frac{2r+1}{2^r} + o(1)$ satisfiable, and (b) hardness of
distinguishing $3$-colorable graphs, and graphs that do not contain an
independent set of size $o(1)$.
  2. A reduction of the problem of studying expectations of products of
functions on the multi-slice to studying expectations of products of functions
on correlated, product spaces. In particular, we are able to deduce analogues
of the Gaussian bounds from \cite{MosselGaussian} for the multi-slice.
  3. In a companion paper, we show further applications of our invariance
principle in extremal combinatorics, and more specifically to proving removal
lemmas of a wide family of hypergraphs $H$ called $\zeta$-forests, which is a
natural extension of the well-studied case of matchings.

the bit-flip errors are modeled using a Markov chain, which for
log-probabilties must be evaluated using a LogSumExp function. We develop the
two versions of our filter by constraining this LogSumExp to have either one or

involving iterative adjustments of hyperparameters. To automate the treatment
planning process, we propose a meta-optimization framework, called MetaPlanner
(MP). Methods: Our MP algorithm automates planning by performing optimization
of treatment planning hyperparameters. The algorithm uses a derivative-free
method (i.e. parallel Nelder-Mead simplex search) to search for weight
configurations that minimize a meta-scoring function. Meta-scoring is performed
by constructing a tier list of the relevant considerations (e.g. dose
homogeneity, conformity, spillage, and OAR sparing) to mimic the clinical
decision-making process. Additionally, we have made our source code publicly
available via github. Results: The proposed MP method is evaluated on two
datasets (21 prostate cases and 6 head and neck cases) collected as part of
clinical workflow. MP is applied to both IMRT and VMAT planning and compared to
a baseline of manual VMAT plans. MP in both IMRT and VMAT scenarios has
comparable or better performance than manual VMAT planning for all evaluated
metrics. Conclusion: Our proposed MP provides a general framework for fully
automated treatment planning that produces high quality treatment plans.
Significance: Our MP method promises to substantially reduce the workload of
treatment planners while maintaining or improving plan quality.

locally transformed into a tensor-product ""core"" of $(1_A \times 1_B)_{\rm

exhibits an exponential hierarchy, and as such identifies the structure of
dominant region modes from which vacuum entanglement could be extracted into a
spatially separated pair of quantum detectors. Beyond the core, remaining modes
of the ""halo"" are determined to be AB-separable in isolation, as well as
separable from the core. However, state preparation protocols that distribute
entanglement in the form of $(1_A \times 1_B)_{\rm mixed}$ core pairs are found
to require additional entanglement in the halo that is obscured by classical
correlations. This inaccessible (bound) halo entanglement is found to mirror
the accessible entanglement, but with a step behavior as the continuum is
approached. It remains possible that alternate initialization protocols that do
not utilize the exponential hierarchy of core-pair entanglement may require
less inaccessible entanglement. Entanglement consolidation is expected to

The standard U-statistic theory is not directly applicable here as the
overlapping spacings form a dependent random sequence. The asymptotic
distribution of the statistics under the null hypothesis and under a sequence
of local alternatives are derived. In terms of the Pitman ARE, the U-statistic
based on Gini's mean square difference of overlapping spacings is found to be

bursts (FRB), in which the observed emission is produced as a narrowly-peaked
intrinsic spectral energy distribution sweeps down in frequency across the
instrumental bandpass as a power-law in time. Though originally motivated by
emission models which invoke a relativistic shock, the model could in principle
apply to a wider range of emission scenarios. We quantify the burst's
detectability using the frequency bandwidth over which most of its
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is accumulated. We demonstrate that by varying just
a single parameter of the toy model-the power-law index \beta of the frequency
drift rate-one can transform a long (and hence preferentially time-resolved)
burst with a narrow time-integrated spectrum into a shorter burst with a broad
power-law time-integrated spectrum. We suggest that burst-to-burst diversity in
the value of \beta could generate the dichotomy between burst duration and
frequency-width recently found by CHIME. In shock models, the value of \beta is
related to the radial density profile of external medium, which in light of the
preferentially longer duration of bursts from repeating sources may point to
diversity in the external environments surrounding repeating versus one-off FRB
sources.

are tested on real AMI recordings containing overlapping speech, and are
evaluated subjectively by human listeners. To objectively evaluate our models,
we also devise a synthetic AMI test set. For human evaluations on real

handle imperfect reference signals, which we call MUSHIRA. Holding network
architectures constant, we find that a fine-tuned semi-supervised model yields
the largest SI-SNR improvement, PESQ scores, and human listening ratings across
synthetic and real datasets, outperforming unadapted generalist models trained
on orders of magnitude more data. Our results show that unsupervised learning

conventional deep neural networks. However, to succeed, these methods require a
`batch' of samples to be available and visited multiple times during training.
While this works well in a static setting, these methods continue to suffer in
a more realistic situation where data arrives in \emph{online streaming
manner}. We empirically demonstrate that the performance of current approaches
degrades if the input is obtained as a stream of data with the following
restrictions: $(i)$ each instance comes one at a time and can be seen only
once, and $(ii)$ the input data violates the i.i.d assumption, i.e., there can
be a class-based correlation. We propose a novel approach (CIOSL) for the
class-incremental learning in an \emph{online streaming setting} to address
these challenges. The proposed approach leverages implicit and explicit dual
weight regularization and experience replay. The implicit regularization is
leveraged via the knowledge distillation, while the explicit regularization
incorporates a novel approach for parameter regularization by learning the
joint distribution of the buffer replay and the current sample. Also, we
propose an efficient online memory replay and replacement buffer strategy that
significantly boosts the model's performance. Extensive experiments and

network (TPARN) for multichannel speech enhancement in the time domain. TPARN
extends a single-channel dual-path network to a multichannel network by adding
a third path along the spatial dimension. First, TPARN processes speech signals
from all channels independently using a dual-path attentive recurrent network
(ARN), which is a recurrent neural network (RNN) augmented with self-attention.
Next, an ARN is introduced along the spatial dimension for spatial context
aggregation. TPARN is designed as a multiple-input and multiple-output
architecture to enhance all input channels simultaneously. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of TPARN over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

unresolved issue. Among the most likely candidates for mediating the Cooper
pair condensate are spin fluctuations and the electron-phonon interaction.
While the former have long been proposed to be responsible for various
observables in the superconducting state, the latter has recently been shown to
produce unconventional gap symmetries when vertex corrections are
self-consistently taken into account. Here, we develop multichannel Eliashberg
theory to incorporate both pairing mechanisms. Solving self-consistently the
full-bandwidth, anisotropic Eliashberg equations for a cuprate model system we
find the characteristic $d_{x^2 -y^2}$ symmetry of the superconducting gap and
a reasonable order of magnitude for $T_c$ ($50-120$ K). We further find that
both mechanisms support an unconventional $d$-wave symmetry of the order
parameter, yet the electron-phonon interaction is chiefly responsible for the
Cooper pairing and high $T_c$, whereas the spin fluctuations have a suppressing
effect on the gap magnitude and critical temperature.

average load. In this paper, we present a general framework that allows us to
analyze various allocation processes that slightly prefer allocating into
underloaded, as opposed to overloaded bins. Our analysis covers several natural
instances of processes, including:
  The Caching process (a.k.a. memory protocol) as studied by Mitzenmacher,
Prabhakar and Shah (2002): At each round we only take one bin sample, but we
also have access to a cache in which the most recently used bin is stored. We
place the ball into the least loaded of the two.
  The Packing process: At each round we only take one bin sample. If the load
is below some threshold (e.g., the average load), then we place as many balls
until the threshold is reached; otherwise, we place only one ball.
  The Twinning process: At each round, we only take one bin sample. If the load
is below some threshold, then we place two balls; otherwise, we place only one
ball.
  The Thinning process as recently studied by Feldheim and Gurel-Gurevich
(2021): At each round, we first take one bin sample. If its load is below some
threshold, we place one ball; otherwise, we place one ball into a
$\textit{second}$ bin sample.
  As we demonstrate, our general framework implies for all these processes a
gap of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ between the maximum load and average load, even
when an arbitrary number of balls $m \geq n$ are allocated (heavily loaded
case). Our analysis is inspired by a previous work of Peres, Talwar and Wieder
(2010) for the $(1+\beta)$-process, however here we rely on the interplay
between different potential functions to prove stabilization.

been solved previously by introducing an ad hoc material model including a

interpolate the interfaced materials permittivity functions. In this work, we
show that the inclusion of realistic spatial dispersion (e.g., hydrodynamic

and instructions within the CPU. Registers are not addressable in the same way
memory is, which makes them immune from memory attacks and manipulation by
other means. In this paper, we take advantage of this to provide a protection
mechanism for critical program data; both active local variables and control
objects on the stack. This protection effectively eliminates the threat of
control- and data-oriented attacks, even by adversaries with full knowledge of
the active stack. Our solution RegGuard, is a compiler register allocation
strategy that utilises the available CPU registers to hold critical variables
during execution. Unlike conventional allocations schemes, RegGuard prioritises
the security significance of a program variable over its expected performance
gain. Our scheme can deal effectively with saved registers to the stack, i.e.,
when the compiler needs to free up registers to make room for the variables of
a new function call. With RegGuard, critical data objects anywhere on the
entire stack are effectively protected from corruption, even by adversaries
with arbitrary read and write access. While our primary design focus is on
security, performance is very important for a scheme to be adopted in practice.
RegGuard is still benefiting from the performance gain normally associated with
register allocations, and the overhead is within a few percent of other
unsecured register allocation schemes for most cases. We present detailed
experiments that showcase the performance of RegGuard using different benchmark
programs and the C library on ARM64 platform.

time-invariant system (in continuous or discrete time) affected also by an
unknown-but-bounded disturbance sequence (with an energy or instantaneous
bound); the corresponding state sequence is measured. The goal is to design
directly from the input and state sequences a controller that enforces a
certain performance specification on the transient behaviour of the unknown
system. The performance specification is expressed through a subset of the
complex plane where closed-loop eigenvalues need to belong, a so called LMI
region. For this control design problem, we provide here convex programs to
enforce the performance specification from data in the form of linear matrix
inequalities (LMI). For generic LMI regions, these are sufficient conditions to
assign the eigenvalues within the LMI region for all possible dynamics
consistent with data, and become necessary and sufficient conditions for
special LMI regions. In this way, we extend classical model-based conditions
from a seminal work in the literature to the setting of data-driven control
from noisy data. Through two numerical examples, we investigate how these
data-based conditions compare with each other.

$27.3\pm0.6$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. Deprojecting these velocities from the

outer ring respectively. We find evidence of subtle dynamical change in the
inner circumbinary ring over the 17 years spanned by the data, manifesting in
variability in the ratio of the intensity of the blueshifted peak to the
redshifted peak of its emission lines and the central velocity becoming more
blueshifted. We perform smoothed-particle hydrodynamic simulations of the
system which suggest that these observed changes are consistent with pumping of
the eccentricity of a radially thin circumbinary ring by the inner binary. We
find a systemic velocity of the GG Carinae system of $-23.2 \pm

problems as compared to their classical counterparts. As the timeline to
developing a quantum-error corrected computer is unclear, the quantum computing
community has dedicated much attention to developing algorithms for currently
available noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ). Thus far, within
NISQ, optimization problems are one of the most commonly studied and are quite
often tackled with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). This
algorithm is best known for computing graph partitions with a maximal
separation of edges (MaxCut), but can easily calculate other problems related
to graphs. Here, I present a novel quantum optimization algorithm, which uses
exponentially less qubits as compared to the QAOA while requiring a
significantly reduced number of quantum operations to solve the MaxCut problem.
Such an improved performance allowed me to partition graphs with 32 nodes on
publicly available 5 qubit gate-based quantum computers without any
preprocessing such as division of the graph into smaller subgraphs. These
results represent a 40% increase in graph size as compared to state-of-art
experiments on gate-based quantum computers such as Google Sycamore. The
obtained lower bound is 54.9% on the solution for actual hardware benchmarks
and 77.6% on ideal simulators of quantum computers. Furthermore, large-scale
optimization problems represented by graphs of a 128 nodes are tackled with
simulators of quantum computers, again without any predivision into smaller
subproblems and a lower solution bound of 67.9% is achieved. The study

According to this approach, coordinated motion is achieved through
stabilization of a performance variable (e.g., an output in a collaborative

stochastic forcing driven by Gaussian and $\alpha$-stable L\'evy -
$\alpha\in(0,2)$ - noise laws, examine the statistics of transition times, and
estimate most probable transition paths. While the Gaussian noise case has been
carefully studied in a plethora of investigations on metastable systems, much
less is known about the L\'evy case, especially in the case of high- and
infinite-dimensional systems. In the weak noise limit, the expected residence
time in each metastable state scales in a fundamentally different way in the
Gaussian vs. L\'evy noise case with respect to the intensity of the noise. In
the former case, the classical Kramers-like exponential law is recovered. In
the latter case, power laws are found, with the exponent equal to $-\alpha$, in
apparent agreement with rigorous results obtained for additive noise in a
related - yet different - reaction-diffusion equation as well as in simpler
models. This can be better understood by treating the L\'evy noise as a
compound Poisson process. The transition paths are studied in a projection of
the state space and remarkable differences are observed between the two
different types of noise. The snowball-to-warm and the warm-to-snowball most
probable transition path cross at the single unstable edge state on the basin
boundary. In the case of L\'evy noise, the most probable transition paths in
the two directions are wholly separated, as transitions apparently take place
via the closest basin boundary region to the outgoing attractor. This property
can be better elucidated by considering singular perturbations to the solar
irradiance.

code distance, we estimate order-of-magnitude improvements in the overheads for
processing around one hundred logical qubits using this approach. Given the
high thresholds demonstrated by LDPC codes, our estimates suggest that
fault-tolerant quantum computation at this scale may be achievable with a few
thousand physical qubits at comparable error rates to what is needed for

controlling the degree of parallelization, with overall objectives including
high system utilization, low synchronization cost, and highly efficient
concurrent execution. The underlying concept is three-fold: (1) sampling is

with charge carriers and phonons offers a path to enhance thermoelectric
performance. The thermopower enhancement by spin fluctuations (SF) has been
observed before. However, the crucial evidence for enhancing
thermoelectric-figure-of-merit (zT) by SF has not been reported until now. Here
we report evidence for such enhancement in the ferromagnetic CrTe. The SF leads
to nearly 80% zT enhancement in ferromagnetic CrTe near and below TC~335 K. The
ferromagnetism in CrTe is originated from the collective electronic and
localized magnetic moments. The field-dependent transport properties
demonstrate the profound impact of SF on the electrons and phonons. The SF
simultaneously enhances the thermopower and reduces the thermal conductivity.
Under an external magnetic field, the enhancement in thermopower is suppressed,
and the thermal conductivity is enhanced, evidencing the existence of a strong
SF near and below TC. The anomalous thermoelectric transport properties are
analyzed based on theoretical models, and a good agreement with experimental
data is found. Furthermore, the detailed analysis proves an insignificant
impact from spin-wave contribution to the transport properties. This study
contributes to the fundamental understanding of spin fluctuation for designing
high-performance spin-driven thermoelectric materials.

Na and Mg exhibit the strongest binding on Zr$_{2}$CS$_{2}$, followed by
Ti$_{2}$CS$_{2}$, Nb$_{2}$CS$_{2}$ and V$_{2}$CS$_{2}$. Using the nudged
elastic band method (NEB) we computed promising diffusion barriers for both
dilute and nearly-full ion surface coverage cases. In the dilute ion adsorption
case, a single Mg and Na atom on Ti$_{2}$CS$_{2}$ experience $\sim$0.47 eV and
$\sim$0.10 eV diffusion barriers between the lowest energy sites, respectively.
For a nearly full surface coverage, a Na ion moving on Ti$_{2}$CS$_{2}$
experiences a $\sim$0.33 eV energy barrier, implying a concentration dependent
diffusion barrier. Our molecular dynamics results indicate that three (one)
layers (layer) of Mg (Na) ion on both surfaces of Ti$_{2}$CS$_{2}$ remain
stable at T=300 K. While, according to voltage calculations, Zr$_{2}$CS$_{2}$
can store Na up to three atomic layers, our MD simulations predict that the
outermost layers detach from Zr$_{2}$CS$_{2}$ monolayer due to weak interaction
between Na ions and the monolayer. This suggests that MD simulations are

healthy, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia cases The

such a dynamic model, we design a mechanism that decides not only which agents
to match, but also when to match them, to minimize the expected number of
unmatched agents. The main contribution of this paper is to achieve theoretical
bounds on the performance of local mechanisms with different timing properties.
We show that an algorithm that waits to thicken the market, called the
$\textit{Patient}$ algorithm, is exponentially better than the
$\textit{Greedy}$ algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that matches agents greedily.
This means that waiting has substantial benefits on maximizing a matching over
a bipartite network. We remark that the Patient algorithm requires the planner
to identify agents who are about to leave the market, and, under the
requirement, the Patient algorithm is shown to be an optimal algorithm. We also
show that, without the requirement, the Greedy algorithm is almost optimal. In
addition, we consider the $\textit{1-sided algorithms}$ where only an agent on
one side can attempt to match. This models a practical matching market such as
a freight exchange market and a labor market where only agents on one side can
make a decision. For this setting, we prove that the Greedy and Patient
algorithms admit the same performance, that is, waiting to thicken the market
is not valuable. This conclusion is in contrast to the case where agents on
both sides can make a decision and the non-bipartite case by [Akbarpour et

Remarkably, these molecules form ideal mixtures with respect to both the
paraelectric-ferroelectric nematic phase behavior and the ferroelectric
polarization density of the mixtures, the principal order parameter of the

the onset of glassy dynamics at low temperature. This behavior is attributable
in part to the similarity of their overall molecular shape and net longitudinal
dipole moment (~ 11 Debye), and to a common tendency for head-to-tail molecular
association. In contrast, the significant difference in molecular structures
leads to poor solubility in the crystal phases, enhancing the stability of the
ferroelectric nematic phase at low temperature in the mixtures and making
possible room temperature electro-optic effects. In the mixtures with excess

minimizing for others, by solving one-dimensional problems and justifying their

further scientific advancements to computational material design. This paper
provides the missing theoretical justification. We identify four classes of

other. Prospective climbing operations in these environments reveals a need for
small, compact robots capable of versatile mobility and manipulation. We
propose a novel robotic concept called ReachBot that fills this need by
combining two existing technologies: extendable booms and mobile manipulation.
ReachBot leverages the reach and tensile strength of extendable booms to
achieve an outsized reachable workspace and wrench capability. Through their
lightweight, compactable structure, these booms also reduce mass and complexity
compared to traditional rigid-link articulated-arm designs. Using these
advantages, ReachBot excels in mobile manipulation missions in low gravity or
that require climbing, particularly when anchor points are sparse. After
introducing the ReachBot concept, we discuss modeling approaches and strategies
for increasing stability and robustness. We then develop a 2D analytical model
for ReachBot's dynamics inspired by grasp models for dexterous manipulators.
Next, we introduce a waypoint-tracking controller for a planar ReachBot in
microgravity. Our simulation results demonstrate the controller's robustness to
disturbances and modeling error. Finally, we briefly discuss next steps that
build on these initially promising results to realize the full potential of
ReachBot.

diffusion kinetics for the intercalation of Li, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, and Al. We

improvement in voltage and energy density for all ions. This voltage increase
was attributed to the extra host sites for electrons present with H$_2$O, thus
leading to a stronger ionization of the ion and a higher voltage. We also found

averaging protocol that both significantly boosts domain generalization and
diminishes the impact of stochasticity by improving the rank correlation

is crucial for reliable early stopping. Taking advantage of our observation, we
show that instead of ensembling unaveraged models (that is typical in

boosts performance. We theoretically explain the boost in performance of
ensembling and model averaging by adapting the well known Bias-Variance

multiple sub-watersheds, but each sub-watershed is still treated as a whole,
and the geoinformation contained within the watershed is not fully utilized. In
this paper, we propose the GNRRM (Graph Neural Rainfall-Runoff Model), a novel
deep learning model that makes full use of spatial information from
high-resolution precipitation data, including flow direction and geographic
information. When compared to baseline models, GNRRM has less over-fitting and
significantly improves model performance. Our findings support the importance
of hydrological data in deep learning-based rainfall-runoff modeling, and we
encourage researchers to include more domain knowledge in their models.

that off-the-shelf dense-captioning models trained on Visual Genome can improve
the spatial structure of images from a different target domain without needing

to investigate the effects of having more than one possible type of clock ""at

massless scalar field in which the gravitational coupling $G_N$ is only a
constant on-shell, mimicking the procedure for $\Lambda$ in unimodular gravity.
Hence we have two ""simultaneous"" clocks in the theory: a scalar field clock,

concurrently are disastrous for recovering the classical limit. The Heisenberg
relations, instead of being saturated, are always realized abundantly above
their bound, with strong quantum effects expected at least in parts of the
trajectory. Semi-classical states always result from situations where we
effectively impose a single clock, either by making the other clock a failed
clock (i.e. by choosing a state where its conjugate constant is infinitely
sharp), or by choosing a basis of constants where all clocks but one are
redundant, i.e. motion or change in phase space does not occur with the passing
of their ""times"". We show how this conclusion generalizes to fluids with any
equation of state. It also applies to systems where ""sub-clocks"" of the same

result, they are ineffective in the scenarios where (i) multiple visual image
domains are involved; (ii) both structure and texture transformations are

multiple domains with significant domain gaps. Unlike previous models that
constrain the generators with the ubiquitous cycle-consistency constraint to
achieve the content similarity, the proposed model employs a perceptual
self-regularization constraint. With a single unified generator, the model can
maintain consistency over the global shapes as well as the local texture

material properties, such as changing the topology of the band structure.
Unfortunately, the weakness of van der Waals interactions makes it difficult to
compute the stacking dependence of properties, and even in a material as simple
as graphite the stacking energetics remain unclear. Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$Te$_{2}$
is a material in which three differently-stacked phases are conveniently
accessible by temperature changes: $1T^{\prime}$, $T^*_d$, and the reported
Weyl semimetal phase $T_d$. The transitions proceed via layer sliding, and the
corresponding interlayer shear mode (ISM) is relevant not just for the stacking
energetics, but for understanding the relationship between the Weyl physics and
structural changes. However, the interlayer interactions of
Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ are not well understood, with wide variation in
computed properties. We report inelastic neutron scattering of the ISM in a
Mo$_{0.91}$W$_{0.09}$Te$_{2}$ crystal. The ISM energies are generally
consistent with the linear chain model (LCM), as expected given the weak
interlayer interaction, though there are some discrepancies from predicted
intensities. However, the interlayer force constants $K_x$ in the $T^*_d$ and
$1T^{\prime}$ phases are substantially weaker than that of $T_d$, at 76(3)% and
83(3)%, respectively. Considering that the relative positioning of atoms in
neighboring layers is approximately the same regardless of overall stacking,
our results suggest that longer-range influences, such as stacking-induced band
structure changes, may be responsible for the substantial change in the
interlayer vibrational coupling. These findings should elucidate the stacking
energetics of Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ and other van der Waals layered

10^{-2}$ $Z_\odot$) binary stars yield most of the pair instability (PI) mass
gap events with $m_1 = 65$--$130$ $M_\odot$. Pop III binary stars contribute
more to the PI mass gap events with increasing redshift, and all the PI mass
gap events have the Pop III origin at redshifts $\gtrsim 8$. Our result can be
assessed by future GW observations in the following two points. First, there
are no binary BHs with $m_1=100$--$130$ $M_\odot$ in our result, and thus the
$m_1$ distribution should suddenly drop in the range of $m_1=100$--$130$
$M_\odot$. Second, the PI mass gap event rate should increase toward higher
redshift up to $\sim 11$, since those events mainly originate from the Pop III
binary stars. We find that the following three assumptions are needed to
reproduce the current GW observations: a top-heavy stellar initial mass
function and the presence of close binary stars for Pop III and EMP binary
stars, and inefficient convective overshoot in the main-sequence phase of
stellar evolution. Without any of the above, the number of PI mass gap events
becomes too low to reproduce current GW observations.

both the orbital parameters of the star and also the mass and spinning of the
massive black hole (MBH) can be revealed by using the time of arrival (TOA) of
the QPEs. By applying the model to the observed QPEs of GSN069, we find that
the star is in a near-circular orbit ( $e_\bullet=0.05^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$) with
semimajor axis of $\sim 365^{+54}_{-49}r_{\rm g}$ around a MBH with
$M_\bullet=3.0^{+0.9}_{-0.6} \times10^5M_\odot$. The alternative short and long
recurring time of the QPEs of GSN069 can be well explained by the small
eccentricity and the orbital precession of the star. We find that the QPEs of
GSN069 are possibly driven by a striped stellar core colliding with accretion
disc after partial tidal disruption event around the MBH. For GSN069-like
galaxies, if continuous X-ray monitoring of QPE events can be accumulated with
uncertainties of TOA $\lesssim 100-150$s, the spin of massive black hole can be
constrained by fitting to QPEs. Our results show that the timing of QPEs can

aggregate cost functions. We consider the case when some of the agents may be
asynchronous and/or Byzantine faulty. In this case, the classical algorithm of
distributed gradient descent (DGD) is rendered ineffective. Our goal is to
design techniques improving the efficacy of DGD with asynchrony and Byzantine

functions by the generic notion of $(f, \,r; \epsilon)$-redundancy where $f$

and $\epsilon$ characterizes the closeness between agents' cost functions. This
allows us to quantify the level of redundancy present amongst the agents' cost
functions, for any given distributed optimization problem. We demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, the merits of our proposed redundancy model in
improving the robustness of DGD against asynchronous and Byzantine agents, and
their extensions to distributed stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) for robust

have been computationally designed to have giant valley splitting approaching 9
meV. However, none of them has been fabricated may due to their complexity.
Here, we remarkably simplify the original designed complex SiGe
heterostructures by laying out the Si QW directly on the Ge substrate followed
by capping a (Ge4Si4)n superlattice(SL) barrier with a small sacrifice on VS as
it is reduced from a maximum of 8.7 meV to 5.2 meV. Even the smallest number of

for developing stable spin qubits. We also develop an effective Hamiltonian
model to reveal the underlying microscopic physics of enhanced valley splitting

reduce the VS instead of enhancing it. Only the (Ge4Si4)n SL barriers with an
extremely strong coupling with Si QW valley states provide a remarkable
enhancement in VS. These findings lay a solid theoretical foundation for the
realization of sufficiently large VS for Si qubits.

and temperature 1800-2000 K, are generally assumed to be caused by
olivine-spinel phase transformation (PT). However, there are many existing
puzzles: (a) What are the mechanisms for jump from geological 10^-17-10^-15 1/s
to seismic 10-10^3 1/s strain rates? Is it possible without PT? (b) How does
metastable olivine, which does not completely transform to spinel at high
temperature and deeply in the region of stability of spinel for over the
million years, suddenly transforms during seconds and generates seismic strain
rates 10-10^3 1/s? (c) How to connect deviatorically dominated seismic signals
with volume-change dominated PT strain during PT? Here we introduce a
combination of several novel concepts that allow us to resolve the above
puzzles quantitatively. We treat the PT in olivine like plastic strain-induced
(instead of pressure/stress-induced) and find an analytical 3D solution for
coupled deformation-PT-heating processes in a shear band. This solution
predicts conditions for severe (singular) transformation-induced plasticity
(TRIP) and self-blown-up TRIP-PT-heating process due to positive
thermomechanochemical feedback between TRIP and strain-induced PT. In nature,
this process leads to temperature in a band exceeding the unstable stationary
temperature, above which the self-blown-up shear-heating process in the shear
band occurs after finishing the PT. Without PT and TRIP, significant
temperature and strain rate increase is impossible. Due to the much smaller
band thickness in the laboratory, heating within the band does not occur, and
plastic flow after the PT is very limited. Our findings change the main
concepts in studying the initiation of the deep-focus earthquakes and PTs
during plastic flow in geophysics in general.

has received ever-increasing focus in the community. In particular, designing a
class-discrimination based approach would be desired as it fits seamlessly with

compression (CDC), which injects class discrimination in both pruning and
distillation to facilitate the CNNs training goal. We first study the
effectiveness of a group of discriminant functions for channel pruning, where
we include well-known single-variate binary-class statistics like Student's
T-Test in our study via an intuitive generalization. We then propose a novel
layer-adaptive hierarchical pruning approach, where we use a coarse class
discrimination scheme for early layers and a fine one for later layers. This
method naturally accords with the fact that CNNs process coarse semantics in
the early layers and extract fine concepts at the later. Moreover, we leverage
discriminant component analysis (DCA) to distill knowledge of intermediate
representations in a subspace with rich discriminative information, which
enhances hidden layers' linear separability and classification accuracy of the
student. Combining pruning and distillation, CDC is evaluated on CIFAR and
ILSVRC 2012, where we consistently outperform the state-of-the-art results.

strong Lya emission at $z\sim3.2$ (LABn06; Nilsson et al. 2006). Our
observations reveal a two-lobed Lya nebula, at least $\sim$173 pkpc in
diameter, with a light-weighted centroid near a mid-infrared source (within
$\approx$17.2 pkpc) that appears to host an obscured AGN. The Lya emission near
the AGN is also coincident in velocity with the kinematic center of the nebula,
suggesting that the nebula is both morphologically and kinematically centered
on the AGN. Compared to AGN-selected Lya nebulae, the surface brightness
profile of this nebula follows a typical exponential profile at large radii
($>$25 pkpc), although at small radii, the profile shows an unusual dip at the
location of the AGN. The kinematics and asymmetry are similar to, and the CIV
and HeII upper limits are consistent with other AGN-powered Lya nebulae.
Double-peaked and asymmetric line profiles suggest that Lya resonant scattering
may be important in this nebula. These results support the picture of the AGN
being responsible for powering a Lya nebula that is oriented roughly in the
plane of the sky. Further observations will explore whether the central surface
brightness depression is indicative of either an unusual gas or dust
distribution or variation in the ionizing output of the AGN over time.

stable length references - the arms of the interferometer and an on-board

control systems, attempting minimal or no changes to the baseline LISA mission
hardware. The interferometer arm(s) provides the most stable reference
available in the LISA science band (0.1 mHz - 1 Hz), while the cavity sensor's
wide-band and linear readout enables additional control system gain below and
above the LISA band. The main technical issue with this dual sensor approach is
the undesirable slow laser frequency pulling which couples into the control
system with the imperfect knowledge of the Doppler shift of the light due to
relative spacecraft motion along the LISA arm. This paper outlines requirements
on the Doppler shift knowledge to maintain the cavity well within the resonance
when activating the fused control system. Two Doppler shift estimation methods
are presented that use the already on-board measurements, the inter-spacecraft
interferometer link (the main science measurement), and the absolute
inter-spacecraft laser ranging system. Both methods reach the required
precision after a few thousand seconds of measurement integration. The paper
demonstrates an approach to initialise and engage the proposed laser
stabilization system, starting from free-running laser and ending with the dual

residual laser frequency noise in the LISA science band by over 3 orders of

Despite significant performance improvement, few efforts have been paid to
facilitate understanding of EEA methods. Most existing studies rest on the
assumption that a small number of pre-aligned entities can serve as anchors
connecting the embedding spaces of two KGs. Nevertheless, no one investigates
the rationality of such an assumption. To fill the research gap, we define a
typical paradigm abstracted from existing EEA methods and analyze how the
embedding discrepancy between two potentially aligned entities is implicitly
bounded by a predefined margin in the scoring function. Further, we find that
such a bound cannot guarantee to be tight enough for alignment learning. We
mitigate this problem by proposing a new approach, named NeoEA, to explicitly
learn KG-invariant and principled entity embeddings. In this sense, an EEA
model not only pursues the closeness of aligned entities based on geometric
distance, but also aligns the neural ontologies of two KGs by eliminating the
discrepancy in embedding distribution and underlying ontology knowledge. Our
experiments demonstrate consistent and significant improvement in performance
against the best-performing EEA methods.

generate novel concept combinations is out of reach for most current models. In
this work, we use energy-based models (EBMs) to handle compositional generation
over a set of attributes. To make them scalable to high-resolution image
generation, we introduce an EBM in the latent space of a pre-trained generative
model such as StyleGAN. We propose a novel EBM formulation representing the
joint distribution of data and attributes together, and we show how sampling
from it is formulated as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Given
a pre-trained generator, all we need for controllable generation is to train an
attribute classifier. Sampling with ODEs is done efficiently in the latent
space and is robust to hyperparameters. Thus, our method is simple, fast to
train, and efficient to sample. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art in both conditional sampling and sequential
editing. In compositional generation, our method excels at zero-shot generation
of unseen attribute combinations. Also, by composing energy functions with
logical operators, this work is the first to achieve such compositionality in
generating photo-realistic images of resolution 1024x1024. Code is available at

feature of CNewSum is that its test set contains adequacy and deducibility

nearly perfect (92% correlation), redshifted (by ~4,000 km/sec) replica of the
total flux spectrum. Such a striking correspondence has never been observed
before in nebular-phase supernova spectropolarimetry, although data capable of
revealing it have heretofore been only rarely obtained. Through comparison with
2D polarized radiative transfer simulations of stellar explosions, we
demonstrate that localized ionization produced by the decay of a high-velocity,
spatially confined clump of radioactive 56-Ni -- synthesized by and launched as
part of the explosion with final radial velocity exceeding 4,500 km/sec -- can
reproduce the observations through enhanced electron scattering. Additional
data taken earlier in the nebular phase (day 134) yield a similarly strong
correlation (84%) and redshift, whereas photospheric-phase epochs that sample
days 8 through 97, do not. This suggests that the primary polarization
signatures of the high-velocity scattering source only come to dominate once
the thick, initially opaque hydrogen envelope has turned sufficiently
transparent. This detection in an otherwise fairly typical core-collapse
supernova adds to the growing body of evidence supporting strong asymmetries
across Nature's most common types of stellar explosions, and establishes the

searching the structure of a network, few attempts have been made on another
promising track, channel pruning, which recently has made major headway in
designing efficient deep learning models. In fact, prior pruning methods adopt
human-made pruning functions to score a channel's importance for channel
pruning, which requires domain knowledge and could be sub-optimal. To this end,
we pioneer the use of genetic programming (GP) to discover strong pruning
metrics automatically. Specifically, we craft a novel design space to express
high-quality and transferable pruning functions, which ensures an end-to-end
evolution process where no manual modification is needed on the evolved
functions for their transferability after evolution. Unlike prior methods, our
approach can provide both compact pruned networks for efficient inference and
novel closed-form pruning metrics which are mathematically explainable and thus
generalizable to different pruning tasks. While the evolution is conducted on
small datasets, our functions shows promising results when applied to more
challenging datasets, different from those used in the evolution process. For
example, on ILSVRC-2012, an evolved function achieves state-of-the-art pruning
results.

at delays which are outside the foreground 'wedge', which has been studied

filtering strategies are proposed which may mitigate such coupling systematics.
The semi-analytic coupling model herein presented may be used to study mutual

are offset by a distance comparable to the size of the source regions, the
observed energetic particle composition He/H can be strongly variable over more

Assuming a $^3$He/$^4$He source ratio of $10 \%$ in impulsive $^3$He-rich

ratio at observation sites also vary considerably. The variability of the ion
composition ratios depends on the radial distance, which can be tested by
observations made at different radial locations. We discuss the implication of
these results on the variability of ion composition of impulsive events and on
further PSP and Solar Orbiter observations close to the Sun.

chosen by a principal. The products have qualities drawn i.i.d. from a common
prior. The principal aims to choose the better product, but the quality of a
product can only be estimated via a coarse-grained threshold test: for chosen
$\theta$, the principal learns whether a product's quality exceeds $\theta$ or
not.
  We study this problem under two types of interactions. In the first, the
principal does the testing herself, and can choose tests from a class of
allowable tests. We show that the optimum strategy for the principal is to
administer different tests to the two products: one which is passed with
probability $\frac{1}{3}$ and the other with probability $\frac{2}{3}$. If,
however, the principal is required to choose the tests in a symmetric manner
(i.e., via an i.i.d.~distribution), then the optimal strategy is to choose
tests whose probability of passing is drawn uniformly from $[\frac{1}{4},
\frac{3}{4}]$.
  In our second model, test difficulties are selected endogenously by the
firms. This corresponds to a setting in which the firms must commit to their
testing procedures before knowing the quality of their products. This
interaction naturally gives rise to a signaling game; we characterize the
unique Bayes-Nash Equilibrium of this game, which happens to be symmetric. We
then calculate its Price of Anarchy in terms of the principal's probability of
choosing the worse product. Finally, we show that by restricting both firms'
set of available thresholds to choose from, the principal can lower the Price
of Anarchy of the resulting equilibrium; however, there is a limit, in that for
every (common) restricted set of tests, the equilibrium failure probability is
strictly larger than under the optimal i.i.d. distribution.

of the Sun's differential gravitational acceleration on the centers of mass of
adjacent fragments at the time of breakup and therefore a function of
heliocentric distance. Their total of 7.8 m/s is equivalent to nearly 38 km in
the sum of distances of the centers of mass along the radius vector and to the
nuclear size of about 60 km. The observed sheath of diffuse material, the

  Hyperbolic Conservation Laws: Discrete Divergence Operator","Published on Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics",,,,"math.NA cs.LG cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A least-squares neural network (LSNN) method was introduced for solving
scalar linear and nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws (HCLs) in [7, 6]. This
method is based on an equivalent least-squares (LS) formulation and uses ReLU
neural network as approximating functions, making it ideal for approximating
discontinuous functions with unknown interface location. In the design of the
LSNN method for HCLs, the numerical approximation of differential operators is
a critical factor, and standard numerical or automatic differentiation along
coordinate directions can often lead to a failed NN-based method. To overcome
this challenge, this paper rewrites HCLs in their divergence form of space and
time and introduces a new discrete divergence operator. As a result, the
proposed LSNN method is free of penalization of artificial viscosity.
Theoretically, the accuracy of the discrete divergence operator is estimated
even for discontinuous solutions. Numerically, the LSNN method with the new
discrete divergence operator was tested for several benchmark problems with
both convex and non-convex fluxes, and was able to compute the correct physical
solution for problems with rarefaction, shock or compound waves. The method is
capable of capturing the shock of the underlying problem without oscillation or
smearing, even without any penalization of the entropy condition, total
variation, and/or artificial viscosity.

However, existing works often treat offline policy learning and online
exploration as two separate processes, which are often accompanied by severe

robotic manipulation tasks involve complex sub-task structures, which are very
challenging to be solved in RL with sparse reward. In this work, we propose a

place rough restrictions on flavor structures of neutrinos. Under these

submatrix has a waterfall hierarchy without some fine-tuning. Therefore, it is
likely that $Y_{\nu}$ and $M_{R}$ have qualitatively different flavor

elements, they imply existence of a universal generalized CP symmetry in the

aligned with the receiver's, in that conditioned on the receiver's action, the
sender derives higher utility when the state of the world matches the action.
  Our focus is on whether, in such a setting, being constrained helps a
receiver. Intuitively, if the receiver can only take the sender's preferred
action with a smaller probability, the sender might have to reveal more
information, so that the receiver can take the action more specifically when
the sender prefers it. We show that with a binary state of the world, this
intuition indeed carries through: under very mild non-degeneracy conditions, a
more constrained receiver will always obtain (weakly) higher utility than a
less constrained one. Unfortunately, without additional assumptions, the result
does not hold when there are more than two states in the world, which we show
with an explicit example.

to the availability of software for feature extraction. Feature-based
time-series analysis can now be performed using many different feature sets,
including hctsa (7730 features: Matlab), feasts (42 features: R), tsfeatures
(63 features: R), Kats (40 features: Python), tsfresh (up to 1558 features:
Python), TSFEL (390 features: Python), and the C-coded catch22 (22 features:
Matlab, R, Python, and Julia). There is substantial overlap in the types of
methods included in these sets (e.g., properties of the autocorrelation
function and Fourier power spectrum), but they are yet to be systematically
compared. Here we compare these seven sets on computational speed, assess the
redundancy of features contained in each, and evaluate the overlap and
redundancy between them. We take an empirical approach to feature similarity
based on outputs across a diverse set of real-world and simulated time series.
We find that feature sets vary across three orders of magnitude in their
computation time per feature on a laptop for a 1000-sample series, from the
fastest sets catch22 and TSFEL (~0.1ms per feature) to tsfeatures (~3s per
feature). Using PCA to evaluate feature redundancy within each set, we find the
highest within-set redundancy for TSFEL and tsfresh. For example, in TSFEL, 90%
of the variance across 390 features can be captured with just four PCs.
Finally, we introduce a metric for quantifying overlap between pairs of feature
sets, which indicates substantial overlap. We found that the largest feature
set, hctsa, is the most comprehensive, and that tsfresh is the most
distinctive, due to its incorporation of many low-level Fourier coefficients.
Our results provide empirical understanding of the differences between existing
feature sets, information that can be used to better tailor feature sets to

unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). It creates a set of pseudo labels for the

noisy, sparse and do not provide any information about inter-pixel

semantic segmentation is a task of predicting highly structured pixel-level
outputs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method of transferring the
inter-pixel correlations from the source domain to the target domain via a
self-attention module. The module takes the prediction of the segmentation
network as an input and creates a self-attended prediction that correlates
similar pixels. The module is trained only on the source domain to learn the
domain-invariant inter-pixel correlations, then later, it is used to train the
segmentation network on the target domain. The network learns not only from the
pseudo labels but also by following the output of the self-attention module
which provides additional knowledge about the inter-pixel correlations. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method significantly improves the
performance on two standard UDA benchmarks and also can be combined with recent
state-of-the-art method to achieve better performance.

two-stage greedy iterative optimization procedure. More importantly, we present
theoretical justifications on convergence of CATRO and performance of pruned
networks. Experimental results demonstrate that CATRO achieves higher accuracy
with similar computation cost or lower computation cost with similar accuracy
than other state-of-the-art channel pruning algorithms. In addition, because of
its class-aware property, CATRO is suitable to prune efficient networks

magnetic fields or underlying nuclear spin-defects in the substrate can break
this time reversal symmetry. In particular, magnetic impurities lead to
back-scattering by spin-flip processes. We have investigated the effects of
point-wise magnetic impurities on the transport properties of helical edge
states in the BHZ model using the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function formalism

study the influence of impurity strength and spin impurity polarization. We
observe a secondary effect of defect-defect interaction that depends on the

reasonable climate states for standard test cases, such as the Held-Suarez
test, and then used to simulate diverse exoclimates by varying input parameters
such as rotation rates, instellation, atmospheric optical properties,
frictional timescales and so on. In such studies, there is an implicit
assumption that the model which works reasonably well for the standard test

Here, we test this assumption using the open-source general circulation model
THOR to simulate atmospheric circulation on tidally locked Earth-like planets
with rotation periods of 0.1 to 100 days. We find that the model error, as
quantified by the ratio between physical and spurious numerical contributions
to the angular momentum balance, is extremely variable across this range of
rotation periods with some cases where numerical errors are the dominant
component. Increasing model grid resolution does improve errors but using a
higher-order numerical diffusion scheme can sometimes magnify errors for
finite-volume dynamical solvers. We further show that to minimize error and
make the angular momentum balance more physical within our model, the surface
friction timescale must be smaller than the rotational timescale.

personalized services, especially recommendation. Also, recent studies have
shown that centralized models are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, compromising
their integrity. In the context of recommender systems, a typical goal of such
poisoning attacks is to promote the adversary's target items by interfering
with the training dataset and/or process. Hence, a common practice is to
subsume recommender systems under the decentralized federated learning
paradigm, which enables all user devices to collaboratively learn a global
recommender while retaining all the sensitive data locally. Without exposing
the full knowledge of the recommender and entire dataset to end-users, such
federated recommendation is widely regarded `safe' towards poisoning attacks.
In this paper, we present a systematic approach to backdooring federated
recommender systems for targeted item promotion. The core tactic is to take
advantage of the inherent popularity bias that commonly exists in data-driven
recommenders. As popular items are more likely to appear in the recommendation
list, our innovatively designed attack model enables the target item to have
the characteristics of popular items in the embedding space. Then, by uploading
carefully crafted gradients via a small number of malicious users during the
model update, we can effectively increase the exposure rate of a target
(unpopular) item in the resulted federated recommender. Evaluations on two
real-world datasets show that 1) our attack model significantly boosts the
exposure rate of the target item in a stealthy way, without harming the
accuracy of the poisoned recommender; and 2) existing defenses are not
effective enough, highlighting the need for new defenses against our local
model poisoning attacks to federated recommender systems.

that, for every $r \ge 3$, the structure of a random $K_{r+1}$-free graph with

optional policies by solely looking at the received reward, it has to
implicitly optimize a Multi-Armed-Bandit (MAB) problem. This arises the
question: are current RL algorithms capable of solving MAB problems? We claim
that the surprising answer is no. In our experiments we show that in some
situations they fail to solve a basic MAB problem, and in many common
situations they have a hard time: They suffer from regression in results during
training, sensitivity to initialization and high sample complexity. We claim
that this stems from variance differences between policies, which causes two
problems: The first problem is the ""Boring Policy Trap"" where each policy have
a different implicit exploration depends on its rewards variance, and leaving a
boring, or low variance, policy is less likely due to its low implicit
exploration. The second problem is the ""Manipulative Consultant"" problem, where
value-estimation functions used in deep RL algorithms such as DQN or deep Actor
Critic methods, maximize estimation precision rather than mean rewards, and
have a better loss in low-variance policies, which cause the network to
converge to a sub-optimal policy. Cognitive experiments on humans showed that
noised reward signals may paradoxically improve performance. We explain this
using the aforementioned problems, claiming that both humans and algorithms may
share similar challenges in decision making.
  Inspired by this result, we propose the Adaptive Symmetric Reward Noising
(ASRN) method, by which we mean equalizing the rewards variance across
different policies, thus avoiding the two problems without affecting the
environment's mean rewards behavior. We demonstrate that the ASRN scheme can
dramatically improve the results.

this purpose, we have used observations that were carried out using both
spaced-based (Wind/Waves) and ground-based (Nan\c{c}ay Decameter Array and
Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph) facilities. In order to compare the flux densities
observed by the different instruments, we have carefully calibrated the data
and displayed them in Solar Flux Units. The main result of our study is that
type III bursts, in the metric to hectometric wavelength range, statistically
exhibit a clear maximum of their median radio flux density around 2 MHz.
Although this result was already reported by inspecting the spectral profiles
of type III bursts in the frequency range 20 kHz - 20 MHz, our study extends
such analysis for the first time to metric radio frequencies (i.e., from 20 kHz
to 410 MHz) and confirms the maximum spectral response around 2 MHz. In
addition, using a simple empirical model we show that the median radio flux $S$
of the studied dataset obeys the polynomial form $Y = 0.04 X^3 - 1.63 X^2 +
16.30 X -41.24$, with $X=\ln{(F_\text{MHz})}$ and with $Y=\ln{(S_\text{SFU})}$.
Using the Sittler and Guhathakurtha model for coronal streamers
\citep{Sit1999}, we have found that maximum of radio power falls therefore in
the range 4 to 10 $R_{\odot}$, depending on whether the type III emissions are
assumed to be at the fundamental or the harmonic.

impact of changing the initial conditions of the economy's state variables. We

likely suffer from spurious features. We investigate these effects by studying
adversarial robustness - a local generalization property - to reveal hard,
model-specific instances and spurious features. For this purpose, we derive
perturbation models for SAT and TSP. Unlike in other applications, where
perturbation models are designed around subjective notions of imperceptibility,
our perturbation models are efficient and sound, allowing us to determine the
true label of perturbed samples without a solver. Surprisingly, with such
perturbations, a sufficiently expressive neural solver does not suffer from the
limitations of the accuracy-robustness trade-off common in supervised learning.
Although such robust solvers exist, we show empirically that the assessed

homomorphic images of single qubit stabilisers do not allow for consistent
assignments of outcomes of local observables. As an application, we show that
CHSH inequality can be straightforwardly generalised to nonlocality

paper, we deal with multimodal sarcasm and humor detection from conversational

the modalities, sarcasm detection is challenging since large datasets are not
available for this task in the literature. Therefore, we primarily focus on
resource-constrained training, where the number of training samples is limited.
To this end, we propose a novel multimodal learning system, MuLOT (Multimodal
Learning using Optimal Transport), which utilizes self-attention to exploit
intra-modal correspondence and optimal transport for cross-modal
correspondence. Finally, the modalities are combined with multimodal attention
fusion to capture the inter-dependencies across modalities. We test our
approach for multimodal sarcasm and humor detection on three benchmark datasets
- MUStARD (video, audio, text), UR-FUNNY (video, audio, text), MST (image,

Thermal excitation of the individual spins by the hot environment leads to

that the thermal excitation can be compensated by spin-cooling via optical

strong coupling with currently available high-quality resonators and enables
C-QED effects at room temperature with potential applications in quantum

tether-cutting reconnection processes occurred and resulted in an M1.3 confined
flare accompany with the formation of a sigmoid structure. It is found that the
flare had a conjugate compact footpoint brightenings, which correspond to the
footpoints of the sigmoid. Furthermore, observational evidence of explosive
evaporation is well diagnosed at the conjugate footpoint brightenings in the
impulsive phase of the flare. After the flare, continuous cool condensations
formed at about the middle section of the sigmoid and then moved in opposite
directions along the sigmoid, eventually leading to the formation of the
filament. These observations suggest that magnetic reconnection not only can
form the magnetic field structure of the filament, but also heat their
chromospheric footpoints during their formation and drive chromospheric
evaporation. As a result, the heated chromospheric plasma may be evaporated
into the magnetic field structure of the filament, where the accumulated hot
plasma might suffer from thermal instability or thermal non-equilibrium,
causing catastrophic cooling and coronal condensation to form the cool dense
material of the filament. This observation lends strong support to the
evaporative-condensation model and highlights the crucial role of magnetic
reconnection in forming both the magnetic field structure and the cool dense

paper, different from existing work with a perfect CSI, the covariance matrix
of malicious interference (CMMI) from Mallory is estimated and is used to
construct the null-space of interference (NSI). Finally, the receive beamformer
at Bob is designed to remove the malicious interference using the NSI. To
improve the estimation accuracy, a rank detector relying on Akaike information

methods are proposed as follows: principal component analysis-eigenvalue

is a rank deduction method whereas the JD method is a joint optimization method
with improved performance in low signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR)
region at the expense of increased complexities. Simulation results show that
the proposed PCA-EVD performs much better than the existing method like sample
estimated covariance matrix (SCM) and EVD in terms of normalized mean square

excellent NMSE performance better than PCA-EVD in the low SINR region (SINR <

the pose is estimated after the face detection. However, such sequential
computations lead to higher latency. In this paper, we propose a low latency
and lightweight network for simultaneous face detection, landmark localization

challenging to locate the facial landmarks for faces with large angles, a pose
loss is proposed to constrain the learning. Moreover, we also propose an
uncertainty multi-task loss to learn the weights of individual tasks
automatically. Another challenge is that robots often use low computational
units like ARM based computing core and we often need to use lightweight
networks instead of the heavy ones, which lead to performance drop especially
for small and hard faces. In this paper, we propose online feedback sampling to
augment the training samples across different scales, which increases the

detected at the inclination angle of $\sim10^{\rm o}$--$70^{\rm o}$ away from
jets. Except for the inclination angle of UFOs, the UFOs in radio-loud AGNs
have similar properties to that in radio-quiet AGNs. The UFOs with such low
inclination cannot be explained in the line-force mechanism. The
magnetic-driving mechanism is suggested to explain the UFOs based on a
self-similar solution with radiative transfer calculations. However, the
energetics of self-similar solution need to be further confirmed based on
numerical simulations. To understand the formation and acceleration of UFOs in
radio-loud AGNs, this paper presents a model of the disk winds driven by both
line force and magnetic field and implements numerical simulations. Initially,
a magnetic field is set to 10 times stronger than the gas pressures at the disk
surface. Simulation results imply that the disk winds driven by both line force
and magnetic field could describe the properties of UFOs in radio-loud AGNs.
Pure magnetohydrodynamics (MHDs) simulation is also implemented. When the
initial conditions are the same, the hybrid models of magnetic fields and line
force are more helpful to form UFOs than the pure MHD models. It is worth
studying the case of a stronger magnetic field to confirm this result.

different properties on the model and impact its accuracy. In this work, we
analyze the partial labeling problem, then propose a solution based on two key

two probability quantities: the class distribution in the overall dataset and
the specific label likelihood for a given data sample. We propose to estimate
the class distribution using a dedicated temporary model, and we show its
improved efficiency over a naive estimation computed using the dataset's
partial annotations. Second, during the training of the target model, we
emphasize the contribution of annotated labels over originally un-annotated

However, due to the large number of parameters, the complex computational flow

number of issues that need to be addressed in its hardware design. This is both
an opportunity and a challenge. We propose Vis-TOP (Visual Transformer Overlay

differs from coarse-grained overlay processors such as CPU, GPU, NPE, and from
fine-grained customized designs for a specific model. Vis-TOP summarizes the
characteristics of all visual Transformer models and implements a three-layer

changed freely without changing the hardware architecture. At the same time,
the corresponding instruction bundle and hardware architecture are designed in
three-layer and two-level transformation structure. After quantization of Swin
Transformer tiny model using 8-bit fixed points (fix_8), we implemented an
overlay processor on the ZCU102. Compared to GPU, the TOP throughput is 1.5x
higher. Compared to the existing Transformer accelerators, our throughput per

this paper meets the requirements of real-time AI in terms of both resource

derive the expressions of probability of detection ($\mathcal{P}_d$) and

the theoretical performance gap to infinite-bit MIMO radars for the noise-only

Hamiltonian is obtained. Investigation of the optical quadrature variance as
well as the visibility of a laser field interacting with the multi-mode
squeezed primordial gravitational waves imply that the inflationary primordial
gravitational waves (PGWs) act as a decoherence mechanism that destroy EM
coherency after a characteristic time scale, $\tau_{c}$, which depends on the
inflationary parameters $(\beta,\beta_s,r)$, or equivalently, the fractional
energy density of PGWs, $\Omega_{gw,0}$. The decoherency mechanism overcomes
the coherent effects, such as revivals of optical squeezing, thus leaving their

apparition of side bands at $\omega\sim \omega_0\pm 1.39 \tau_c^{-1}$Hz,

  2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accurate 7DoF prediction of vehicles at an intersection is an important task
for assessing potential conflicts between road users. In principle, this could
be achieved by a single camera system that is capable of detecting the pose of
each vehicle but this would require a large, accurately labelled dataset from
which to train the detector. Although large vehicle pose datasets exist
(ostensibly developed for autonomous vehicles), we find training on these
datasets inadequate. These datasets contain images from a ground level
viewpoint, whereas an ideal view for intersection observation would be elevated
higher above the road surface. We develop an alternative approach using a
weakly supervised method of fine tuning 3D object detectors for traffic
observation cameras; showing in the process that large existing autonomous
vehicle datasets can be leveraged for pre-training. To fine-tune the monocular
3D object detector, our method utilises multiple 2D detections from
overlapping, wide-baseline views and a loss that encodes the subjacent
geometric consistency. Our method achieves vehicle 7DoF pose prediction
accuracy on our dataset comparable to the top performing monocular 3D object
detectors on autonomous vehicle datasets. We present our training methodology,
multi-view reprojection loss, and dataset.

One way to reduce these requirements is to modularize the CNN architecture and
freeze the weights of the heavier modules, that is, the lower layers after
pre-training. Recent studies have proposed alternative modular architectures
and schemes that lead to a reduction in the number of trainable parameters
needed to match the accuracy of fully fine-tuned CNNs on new domains. Our work
suggests that a further reduction in the number of trainable parameters by an
order of magnitude is possible. Furthermore, we propose that new modularization
techniques for multiple domain learning should also be compared on other
realistic metrics, such as the number of interconnections needed between the
fixed and trainable modules, the number of training samples needed, the order
of computations required and the robustness to partial mislabeling of the
training data. On all of these criteria, the proposed architecture demonstrates
advantages over or matches the current state-of-the-art.

is to rely on the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme which is analogous to
the proximal scheme in Euclidean spaces. However, it requires solving a nested
optimization problem at each iteration, and is known for its computational
challenges, especially in high dimension. To alleviate it, very recent works
propose to approximate the JKO scheme leveraging Brenier's theorem, and using
gradients of Input Convex Neural Networks to parameterize the density

stability issues. Instead, this work proposes to use gradient flows in the

enjoys a closed-form differentiable approximation. Thus, the density at each

theoretically investigate the excitation localization of multiple atomic

obtain the time evolutions of quantum correlations via Kubo cumulant
expansions, which arise initially and become finite and leveled afterward,
overtaking the ones without disorders. This indicates two distinct regimes in
time: before the onset of excitation localization, the disorders engage the
disturbance of quantum correlations, which is followed by disorder-assisted
build-up of quantum correlations that maintain at a later stage owing to the
absence of excitations diffusion. The crossing of distinct regimes is pushed
further in time for longer-range correlations, which indicates a characteristic
timescale needed for disorders to sustain them. We also explore the effect of
directionality of couplings and resonant dipole-dipole interactions, which can
drive the system toward the delocalized side when it is under chiral couplings
or large dipole-dipole interaction strengths. The time-evolved quantum
correlations can give insights to the studies of few-body localization
phenomenon and nonequilibrium dynamics in open quantum systems.

needed that help organisations design and deploy ADMS in ways that are ethical,

to validate claims made about their ADMS. Building on previous work, we define
EBA as a structured process whereby an entity's present or past behaviour is

contributions to the existing literature. First, we provide a theoretical
explanation of how EBA can contribute to good governance by promoting
procedural regularity and transparency. Second, we propose seven criteria for

polynomial-time algorithm to the problem of deciding if there exists a popular
assignment with a given set of forced/forbidden edges (this tractability holds
even for partially ordered preferences). Our algorithms are combinatorial and
based on LP duality. They search for an appropriate witness or dual

ground state compared to their neighbouring nuclei. Herein the Multi-Channel
Algebraic Scattering (MCAS) method has been used to describe the low excitation
spectra of those isobars in terms of nucleon-nucleus clusters. A collective
model description of the low-excitation states of the mass-10 core nuclei has
been used to form the coupled-channel interactions required in the method. For
comparison, and to understand the underlying configurations, a shell model
approach has been used to obtain those spectra with no-core (0+2+4)hw and
(0+2)hw shell-model spaces for the mass 10 and mass 11 nuclei respectively.The
results of the calculations suggest the need of a strong coupling in the
collective coupled-channel vibrational model. In particular, the strong
coupling of the collective 2+_1 state of 10Be to the valence neutron plays a
decisive role in forming the positive parity ground state in11Be.

design of new waveforms that can both support high throughputs and present
advantageous signal characteristics. Although most modern systems use
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) for its efficient
equalization, this waveform suffers from multiple limitations such as a high
adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) and high peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR). In this paper, we propose a learning-based method to design OFDM-based
waveforms that satisfy selected constraints while maximizing an achievable
information rate. To that aim, we model the transmitter and the receiver as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that respectively implement a
high-dimensional modulation scheme and perform the detection of the transmitted
bits. This leads to an optimization problem that is solved using the augmented
Lagrangian method. Evaluation results show that the end-to-end system is able
to satisfy target PAPR and ACLR constraints and allows significant throughput
gains compared to a tone reservation (TR) baseline. An additional advantage is
that no dedicated pilots are needed.

mixer are studied experimentally. For the 5-mm-square raw carrot, the normal
distribution shows a characteristic feature of food fragmentation statistics.
This simple result indicates that most random errors contribute to
fragment-size fluctuation. On the other hand, for the crushed raw carrot, the
cumulative fragment size distribution follows the power law where the exponent
$\alpha \simeq 1.62 > 1$. Furthermore, considering the cumulative fragment-size
distribution as a function of length for comparison with geomaterials, such as
fault rocks, the exponent $D \simeq 3.64$. Previous studies have shown that the
power-law distribution observed in sequential fragmentation tends to have a
large exponent value. As our experiment is also based on sequential
fragmentation, the obtained large values of exponents $\alpha$ and $D$ are
consistent with those obtained in previous studies on sequential fragmentation.
On the basis of previous studies and our observations, we discuss the effect of
the preferential fragmentation of particles as large as the mixer blades. We
also discuss the existence of a lower limit beyond which further fragmentation
is difficult, resulting in a power-law distribution tendency for raw carrot
crushed with a food mixer.

random vector with piecewise constant but unknown mean and whose independent,
sub-Gaussian coordinates correspond to the $n$ nodes of a fixed graph. We are
interested in the localisation task of recovering the partition of the nodes
associated to the constancy regions of the mean vector. When the partition
$\mathcal{S}$ consists of only two elements, we characterise the difficulty of
the localisation problem in terms of four key parameters: the maximal noise
variance $\sigma^2$, the size $\Delta$ of the smaller element of the partition,
the magnitude $\kappa$ of the difference in the signal values across contiguous
elements of the partition and the sum of the effective resistance edge weights
$|\partial_r(\mathcal{S})|$ of the corresponding cut -- a graph theoretic
quantity quantifying the size of the partition boundary. In particular, we
demonstrate an information theoretical lower bound implying that, in the low
signal-to-noise ratio regime $\kappa^2 \Delta \sigma^{-2}
|\partial_r(\mathcal{S})|^{-1} \lesssim 1$, no consistent estimator of the true
partition exists. On the other hand, when $\kappa^2 \Delta \sigma^{-2}
|\partial_r(\mathcal{S})|^{-1} \gtrsim \zeta_n \log\{r(|E|)\}$, with $r(|E|)$
being the sum of effective resistance weighted edges and $\zeta_n$ being any
diverging sequence in $n$, we show that a polynomial-time, approximate
$\ell_0$-penalised least squared estimator delivers a localisation error --
measured by the symmetric difference between the true and estimated partition
-- of order $ \kappa^{-2} \sigma^2 |\partial_r(\mathcal{S})| \log\{r(|E|)\}$.
Aside from the $\log\{r(|E|)\}$ term, this rate is minimax optimal. Finally, we

based on the nonlinear shallow water equations (NLSWE) to study the nearshore
dynamics of infragravity (IG) waves. Based on simulations of waves on a
relatively moderate and mild beach slope with a non-hydrostatic wave-flow model
(SWASH), the new theory shows that spatial gradients in IG energy flux are
nearly completely balanced by the combined effect of bottom stresses and
predominantly nonlinear triad interactions. The new balance confirms many
features of existing weakly nonlinear theories, and yields an improved
description in the inner surfzone where waves become highly nonlinear. A gain
of IG energy flux throughout the shoaling and outer surfzones is driven by
triad interactions between IG waves and pairs of sea-swell (SS) waves. The IG
energy flux decreased in the inner surfzone, primarily through an energy
cascade to the swell-band and super-harmonic frequencies where wave energy is
ultimately dissipated. Dissipation by bottom friction was weak on both slopes.
IG wave breaking, characterized by triads between three IG or two IG waves and
one SS wave, was significant only deep inside the surfzone of the mild slope.
Even though IG waves broke on the mild slope, nonlinear interactions between IG
waves and pairs of SS waves were responsible for at least half of the net IG
flux loss.

formation connection over cosmic time. Star formation appears to depend on AGN
type, cluster richness, and black hole accretion, but in ways that are not
direct and have yet to be understood. Much of the confusion is that while some
AGN appear to enhance star formation, others seem to suppress it. By
implementing simplified, yet informed assumptions about AGN feedback on star
formation, we show how AGN with jets might be dominated by two phases in which
star formation is first enhanced, then suppressed. With this new element
incorporated into our model, we make sense of radio and quasar mode behavior in
the star formation rate-stellar mass (SFR-SM) plane for AGN. Due to jet
feedback on star formation, jetted AGN tend to move upwards and rightward in
the SFR-SM plane and then downward and to the right, past both the star-forming
main sequence (SFMS) as well as the radio-quiet AGN. This picture allows us to
predict the black hole connection to star formation as a function of the

cooling is the low performance of thermoelectric materials. While the adverse
effects of lattice phonons on performance can be mitigated, the main difficulty
remains to obtain a large thermoelectric power factor as the Seebeck
coefficient and the electrical conductivity cannot be increased independently.
Here, relating the thermoelastic properties of the electron gas that performs
the thermoelectric energy conversion, to its transport properties, we analyze
theoretically whether an electronic phase transition can enhance thermoelectric
conversion and at what cost. More precisely, we consider the
metal-to-superconductor phase transition in a model two-dimensional system, and
we seek to quantify the contribution of the 2D fluctuating Cooper pairs to the
power factor in the close vicinity of the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$. In
addition, we provide experimental evidence of the rapid increase of the Seebeck
coefficient without decreasing the electrical conductivity near $T_{\rm c}$ in
a 100-nm Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ thin film with high structural quality
resulting in a power factor enhancement of approximately 300. This level of
performance cannot be achieved in a system with low structural quality as shown
experimentally with our sample degraded by ion bombardment as defects preclude
the strong enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient near the phase transition.
Finally, we theoretically discuss the ideal thermoelectric conversion
efficiency (i.e. disregarding adverse phonon effects) and show that driving the
electronic system to the vicinity of a phase transition may be an innovative
path towards a strong performance increase but at the cost of a narrow
temperature range of use of such materials.

quality that determines the utility of pixels in a face image for recognition.
We propose a training-free approach to assess the pixel-level qualities of a
face image given an arbitrary face recognition network. To achieve this, a
model-specific quality value of the input image is estimated and used to build
a sample-specific quality regression model. Based on this model, quality-based
gradients are back-propagated and converted into pixel-level quality estimates.
In the experiments, we qualitatively and quantitatively investigated the
meaningfulness of our proposed pixel-level qualities based on real and

incompliant with the ICAO standards. In all scenarios, the results demonstrate
that the proposed solution produces meaningful pixel-level qualities enhancing
the interpretability of the complete face image quality. The code is publicly

devices locally train a model on their private data and typically communicate
model updates with a server. In decentralized FL (DFL), peers communicate model
updates with each other instead. However, DFL is challenging since (1) the
training data possessed by different peers is often non-i.i.d. (i.e.,
distributed differently between the peers) and (2) malicious, or Byzantine,
attackers can share arbitrary model updates with other peers to subvert the
training process.
  We address these two challenges and present Bristle, middleware between the
learning application and the decentralized network layer. Bristle leverages
transfer learning to predetermine and freeze the non-output layers of a neural
network, significantly speeding up model training and lowering communication
costs. To securely update the output layer with model updates from other peers,
we design a fast distance-based prioritizer and a novel performance-based
integrator. Their combined effect results in high resilience to Byzantine
attackers and the ability to handle non-i.i.d. classes.
  We empirically show that Bristle converges to a consistent 95% accuracy in
Byzantine environments, outperforming all evaluated baselines. In non-Byzantine
environments, Bristle requires 83% fewer iterations to achieve 90% accuracy
compared to state-of-the-art methods. We show that when the training classes
are non-i.i.d., Bristle significantly outperforms the accuracy of the most
Byzantine-resilient baselines by 2.3x while reducing communication costs by
90%.

efficient anomaly detection solutions are needed. In this paper, a two-stage
deep learning-based framework is carefully designed by embedding power system's

encode temporal correlations of the multivariate power system time-series
measurements as 2D images using image-based representation approaches such as
Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and Recurrence Plot (RP) to obtain the latent data
characteristics. These images are then utilized to build a highly reliable and

capable of learning both low and high level characteristics in the images to
detect and discover the exact attack locations without leveraging any prior

it is smoother and more consistent with the completion constraint than putting

for the details of interactive behaviors among road users. The framework
connects these principles to the decision theory and is applied to determine
whether such an approach can reproduce the following phenomena: When two

initial asymmetries, and (b) based on which, they rapidly resolve collision
conflict by adapting their behaviors. When a pedestrian crosses the road while

years because they can be used to realize unidirectional quantum routing and
noise isolation. In this work, we show that the shift of resonance frequencies
of propagating phonons induced by spin-orbit interactions (SOI) of phonons in a
rotating acoustic ring cavity can be used to realize nonreciprocal phonon
blockade. When driving the cavity from different directions, nonreciprocal
single-, two-phonon blockade and phonon-induced tunneling can take place by
varying the parameters of the system to an appropriate value. To realize phonon
blockade, the sublevels of the lower orbit branch of the ground state of
silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers in the diamond membrane are employed to
induce self-interactions of phonons in the cavity. This work provides a way to
achieve acoustic nonreciprocal devices, such as directional acoustic switches
and quantum noise isolation, which may help acoustic information network
processing.

online data. The generality offered by the framework renders it
model-independent, i.e., it can be theoretically analyzed in its abstract
formulation and then instantiated under a variety of model-dependent graph
learning problems. This is possible by phrasing (time-varying) graph learning
as a composite optimization problem, where different functions regulate
different desiderata, e.g., data fidelity, sparsity or smoothness. Instrumental
for the findings is recognizing that the dependence of the majority (if not
all) data-driven graph learning algorithms on the data is exerted through the
empirical covariance matrix, representing a sufficient statistic for the
estimation problem. Its user-defined recursive update enables the framework to
work in non-stationary environments, while iterative algorithms building on
novel time-varying optimization tools explicitly take into account the temporal
dynamics, speeding up convergence and implicitly including a
temporal-regularization of the solution. We specialize the framework to three
well-known graph learning models, namely, the Gaussian graphical model (GGM),
the structural equation model (SEM), and the smoothness-based model (SBM),
where we also introduce ad-hoc vectorization schemes for structured matrices
(symmetric, hollows, etc.) which are crucial to perform correct gradient
computations, other than enabling to work in low-dimensional vector spaces and
hence easing storage requirements. After discussing the theoretical guarantees
of the proposed framework, we corroborate it with extensive numerical tests in
synthetic and real data.

consider a second-order Extended Theory of Gravity belonging to the family of
Degenerate High Order Scalar Tensor theories (DHOST) characterized by a partial
breaking of the Vainshtein screening mechanism. We study this model in two
different scenarios as a description of dark energy only and as a description
of both dark matter and dark energy. Such scenarios have been tested here by
analysing a sample of 16 high-mass galaxy clusters targeted by the Cluster
Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) program using two
complementary probes, namely X-ray and strong-and-weak gravitational lensing
observations. In mass modelling, we adopt a multi-component approach including
hot gas and galactic stellar contributions. For the majority of the clusters in
our sample, results show mild Bayesian evidence in favour of the DHOST model as
a description of dark energy over General Relativity. This model also appears
to alleviate the discrepancy present in General Relativity between X-ray
hydrostatic and lensing mass estimates. For the second scenario where gravity
acts as both dark energy and dark matter due to the partial breaking of the
Vainshtein screening mechanism at cluster scales, the model is statistically
disfavoured compared to General Relativity.

at the same center-of-mass energy that probe the polarized gluon distribution

dijet asymmetries are separated into four jet-pair topologies, which provide
further constraints on the $x$ dependence of the polarized gluon distribution

and with predictions from current next-to-leading order global analyses. They
provide more precise data at low dijet invariant mass that will better
constraint the shape of the polarized gluon distribution function of the
proton.

  This paper presents a watermarking framework for GNNs for both graph and node

embed the watermark into the host model through training to obtain the

been attributed to rapid surface exploration, to biofilms, which are highly

suggested that biofilm and swarming are oppositely controlled, making this
transition particularly interesting for understanding the ability of bacterial
colonies to adapt to challenging environments. Here, the swarm to biofilm
transition is studied experimentally by analyzing the bacterial dynamics both
on the individual and collective scales. We show that both biological and
physical processes facilitate the transition - a few individual cells that
initiate the biofilm program cause nucleation of large, scale-free stationary
aggregates of trapped swarm cells. Around aggregates, cells continue swarming
almost unobstructed, while inside, trapped cells slowly transform to biofilm.
While our experimental findings rule out previously suggested purely physical

local properties of the solar wind to be linked to the coronal source region
from where it originated. Thanks to the close approach of PSP to the Sun and
the simultaneous Metis observation of the solar corona, the flow-aligned
magnetic field and the bulk kinetic energy flux density can be empirically
inferred along the coronal current sheet with an unprecedented accuracy,
allowing in particular estimation of the Alfv\'en radius at 8.7 solar radii
during the time of this event. This is thus the very first study of the same
solar wind plasma as it expands from the sub-Alfv\'enic solar corona to just
above the Alfv\'en surface.

electron Fermi energies are still generally estimated from the corresponding

influence the data values, which may affect the performance of the problems.
The performance of decision-making units (DMUs) is determined using the
slack-based measure (SBM) model, which considers only crisp data values without
uncertainty and is a black-box model. Many authors have used fuzzy SBM and
stochastic SBM to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty, and many have used these
approaches to deal with ambiguous and uncertain data. However, some ambiguous
and uncertain data can not be taken as fuzzy logic and stochastic data due to
the huge set of rules which must be given to construct a conceptual method. So,
this paper tackles the uncertain data using robust optimization in which the
input-output data are limited to remain within an uncertainty set, with extra
constraints depending on the worst-case output for the uncertainty set and
black-box is tackle with network SBM model. Thus, this paper proposes a robust
network SBM model with negative, missing, and undesirable data that aims to
maximize the efficiency same as traditional network SBM, and the constraint for
a worst-case efficiency calculated by the uncertainty set its sustaining
constraint while determining the efficiencies. Finally, the performances of
Indian banks are computed, and then the results of the proposed models are

the domain of interest from conventional image processing techniques to
powerful computer vision algorithms known as convolutional neural networks

hardware for real-time classification, yet the need for deployment on weaker
embedded devices is greater than ever. The work in this paper proposes a
methodology for reconstructing and tuning conventional image classification

trade-off in model accuracy and develops a pipeline through TensorRT for
accelerating such models to run at real-time on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano embedded

leads to a discrepancy in model accuracy between training and deployment, is
often neglected in many papers and thus the work is extended by analysing and
evaluating the impact real world perturbations had on model accuracy once
deployed. The scope of the work concerns developing a more efficient variant of
WasteNet, a collaborative recycling classification model. The newly developed
model scores a test-set accuracy of 95.8% with a real world accuracy of 95%, a
14% increase over the original. Our acceleration pipeline boosted model

algorithms must be able to rapidly adapt to any individual few-shot task,
fitting to a small support set within a task and using it to predict the labels
of the task's query set. This problem setting can be extended to the Bayesian
context, wherein rather than predicting a single label for each query data
point, a model predicts a distribution of labels capturing its uncertainty.
Successful methods in this domain include Bayesian ensembling of MAML-based
models, Bayesian neural networks, and Gaussian processes with learned deep
kernel and mean functions. While Gaussian processes have a robust Bayesian
interpretation in the meta-learning context, they do not naturally model
non-Gaussian predictive posteriors for expressing uncertainty. In this paper,
we design a theoretically principled method, VMGP, extending
Gaussian-process-based meta-learning to allow for high-quality, arbitrary
non-Gaussian uncertainty predictions. On benchmark environments with complex
non-smooth or discontinuous structure, we find our VMGP method performs
significantly better than existing Bayesian meta-learning baselines.

adopted similar distance, core radius, and number of millisecond pulsars

the lane lines on the bird's eye view (BEV) for motion planning and operate
robustly under various lighting conditions. However, LLDNs have not been
actively studied, mostly due to the absence of large public lidar lane
datasets. In this paper, we introduce KAIST-Lane (K-Lane), the world's first
and the largest public urban road and highway lane dataset for Lidar. K-Lane
has more than 15K frames and contains annotations of up to six lanes under
various road and traffic conditions, e.g., occluded roads of multiple occlusion
levels, roads at day and night times, merging (converging and diverging) and
curved lanes. We also provide baseline networks we term Lidar lane detection
networks utilizing global feature correlator (LLDN-GFC). LLDN-GFC exploits the
spatial characteristics of lane lines on the point cloud, which are sparse,
thin, and stretched along the entire ground plane of the point cloud. From
experimental results, LLDN-GFC achieves the state-of-the-art performance with
an F1- score of 82.1%, on the K-Lane. Moreover, LLDN-GFC shows strong

analytical predictions quantify the magnitude of the contraction as a function
of the variance of the prestrain, and show that the chain always shrinks. To

complex connectivity and show that our results are relatively robust to these

of the robotic system in a digital twin of the warehouse, which is accompanied
by a real-time video stream from the real environment through an on-board UAV

remote control of the UAV for intuitive and straightforward human interaction
with the autonomous robot for stocktaking. The effectiveness of the VR-based

with the quasi-entropy. The quasi-entropy is a strictly convex, rotationally
invariant elementary function, giving a singular potential constraining the
eigenvalues of $Q$ within the physical range $(-1/3,2/3)$. Compared with the
potential derived from the Bingham distribution, the quasi-entropy has the same
asymptotic behavior and underlying physics. Meanwhile, it is very easy to
evaluate because of its simple expression. For the elastic energy, we include
all the rotationally invariant terms. The numerical schemes for the gradient
flow are built on the nice properties of the quasi-entropy. The first-order
time discretization is uniquely solvable, keeping the physical constraints and
energy dissipation, which are all independent of the time step. The
second-order time discretization keeps the first two properties
unconditionally, and the third with an $O(1)$ restriction on the time step.
These results also hold when we further incorporate a second-order
discretization in space. Error estimates are also established for time
discretization and full discretization. Numerical examples about defect
patterns are presented to validate the theoretical results.

constraint of a canonical $1.4~M_\odot$ NS, followed by a subsequent
stiffening, required by the $2~M_\odot$ constraint, is driven by the appearance
of $\Delta$ matter due to partial restoration of chiral symmetry. Consequently,
a purely hadronic EoS that accounts for the fundamental properties of quantum
chromodynamics linked to the dynamical emergence of parity doubling with
degenerate masses of nucleons and $\Delta$ resonances can be fully consistent
with multi-messenger data. Therefore, with the present constraints on the EoS,
the conclusion about the existence of the quark matter in the stellar core may
still be premature.

at this problem from the perspective of domain adaptation and bring panoramic
semantic segmentation to a setting, where labelled training data originates
from a different distribution of conventional pinhole camera images. To achieve
this, we formalize the task of unsupervised domain adaptation for panoramic
semantic segmentation and collect DensePASS - a novel densely annotated dataset
for panoramic segmentation under cross-domain conditions, specifically built to
study the Pinhole-to-Panoramic domain shift and accompanied with pinhole camera
training examples obtained from Cityscapes. DensePASS covers both, labelled-
and unlabelled 360-degree images, with the labelled data comprising 19 classes
which explicitly fit the categories available in the source (i.e. pinhole)
domain. Since data-driven models are especially susceptible to changes in data
distribution, we introduce P2PDA - a generic framework for Pinhole-to-Panoramic
semantic segmentation which addresses the challenge of domain divergence with
different variants of attention-augmented domain adaptation modules, enabling
the transfer in output-, feature-, and feature confidence spaces. P2PDA
intertwines uncertainty-aware adaptation using confidence values regulated
on-the-fly through attention heads with discrepant predictions. Our framework
facilitates context exchange when learning domain correspondences and
dramatically improves the adaptation performance of accuracy- and
efficiency-focused models. Comprehensive experiments verify that our framework
clearly surpasses unsupervised domain adaptation- and specialized panoramic

massless Kane fermions were defined as the particles associated with the
peculiar band structure of gapless HgCdTe crystals. Although their dispersion
relation resembles that of a pseudo-spin-1 Dirac semimetal, these particles
were originally considered to be hybrids of pseudospin-1 and -1/2 fermions.
Here we unequivocally find that by considering an additional $\Gamma_{7c}$

two nested Dirac particles. This observation allows the direct application of
Lorentz transformations to describe the relativistic behavior of these

hyperspectral images have rich spatial and spectral information and provide
strong basis for distinguishing different land-cover objects. Benefiting from
the development of deep learning technologies, deep learning based HSI
classification methods have achieved promising performance. Recently, several
neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms have been proposed for HSI
classification, which further improve the accuracy of HSI classification to a
new level. In this paper, NAS and Transformer are combined for handling HSI
classification task for the first time. Compared with previous work, the
proposed method has two main differences. First, we revisit the search spaces
designed in previous HSI classification NAS methods and propose a novel hybrid
search space, consisting of the space dominated cell and the spectrum dominated
cell. Compared with search spaces proposed in previous works, the proposed
hybrid search space is more aligned with the characteristic of HSI data, that
is, HSIs have a relatively low spatial resolution and an extremely high
spectral resolution. Second, to further improve the classification accuracy, we
attempt to graft the emerging transformer module on the automatically designed
convolutional neural network (CNN) to add global information to local region
focused features learned by CNN. Experimental results on three public HSI
datasets show that the proposed method achieves much better performance than
comparison approaches, including manually designed network and NAS based HSI

tasks, such as classification, language processing, protein folding, and
others. However, their reliability is heavily plagued by adversarial inputs:
small input perturbations that cause the model to produce erroneous outputs.
Adversarial inputs can occur naturally when the system's environment behaves
randomly, even in the absence of a malicious adversary, and are a severe cause
for concern when attempting to deploy neural networks within critical systems.
In this paper, we present a new statistical method, called Robustness
Measurement and Assessment (RoMA), which can measure the expected robustness of
a neural network model. Specifically, RoMA determines the probability that a
random input perturbation might cause misclassification. The method allows us
to provide formal guarantees regarding the expected frequency of errors that a
trained model will encounter after deployment. Our approach can be applied to
large-scale, black-box neural networks, which is a significant advantage
compared to recently proposed verification methods. We apply our approach in
two ways: comparing the robustness of different models, and measuring how a
model's robustness is affected by the magnitude of input perturbation. One
interesting insight obtained through this work is that, in a classification
network, different output labels can exhibit very different robustness levels.
We term this phenomenon categorial robustness. Our ability to perform risk and
robustness assessments on a categorial basis opens the door to risk mitigation,
which may prove to be a significant step towards neural network certification

recently-discovered infinite-layer nickelate superconductors. We argue that the
parent state is a self-doped Mott insulator and propose an effective

the model describes a low carrier density Kondo system with incoherent Kondo
scattering at finite temperatures, in good agreement with experimental
observation of the logarithmic temperature dependence of electric resistivity.
Upon increasing Sr doping, the model predicts a breakdown of the Kondo effect,
which provides a potential explanation of the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the
electric resistivity with a power law scaling over a wide range of the
temperature. Unconventional superconductivity is shown to undergo a transition
from nodeless $(d+is)$-wave to nodal $d$-wave near the critical doping due to
competition of the Kondo and Heisenberg superexchange interactions. The
presence of different pairing symmetry may be supported by recent tunneling
measurements.

  A main feature of this work is the connection we establish between word
measures on $GL_N(K)$ and the free group algebra $K\left[F\right]$. A classical
result of Cohn [1964] and Lewin [1969] is that every one-sided ideal of

We show that for $w$ a non-power,
$\mathbb{E}_{w}\left[\mathrm{fix}\right]=2+\frac{C}{q^{N}}+O\left(\frac{1}{q^{2N}}\right)$,

contain $w-1$ but not as a basis element. We describe a full conjectural
picture generalizing this result, featuring a new invariant we call the
$q$-primitivity rank of $w$.
  In the process, we prove several new results about free group algebras. For
example, we show that if $T$ is any finite subtree of the Cayley graph of $F$,
and $I\le K\left[F\right]$ is a right ideal with a generating set supported on
$T$, then $I$ admits a basis supported on $T$. We also prove an analogue of

heat capacity of oxide scale depending of its structural composition and

depend on the percentage of its individual components and is approximately 750

actually possible variations in the composition of oxide scale can lead to a
change in its specific heat capacity from 850 to 1150 J/(kg K). The obtained

and line-of-sight (LoS) path diversity gains of multi-IRS signal reflection.
Unlike existing works where only one single multi-IRS reflection path from the
BS to user is selected, we propose a new and more general multi-path beam
routing scheme. Specifically, the BS sends the user's information signal via
multiple orthogonal active beams (termed as active beam splitting), which point
towards different IRSs. Then, these beamed signals are subsequently reflected
by selected IRSs via their CPB in different paths, and finally coherently
combined at the user's receiver (thus named {\it \textbf{passive beam
combining}}). For this scheme, we formulate a new multi-path beam routing
design problem to jointly optimize the number of IRS reflection paths, the
selected IRSs for each of the reflection paths, the active/passive beamforming
at the BS/each selected IRS, as well as the BS's power allocation over
different active beams, so as to maximize the received signal power at the
user. To solve this challenging problem, we first derive the optimal BS/IRS
beamforming and BS power allocation for a given set of reflection paths. The
clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining

establishing its measurement validity. Measurement invariance is typically
assessed by differential item functioning (DIF) analysis, i.e., detecting DIF
items whose response distribution depends on not only the latent trait measured
by the instrument but also the group membership. DIF analysis is confounded by
the group difference in the latent trait distributions. Many DIF analyses
require knowing several anchor items that are DIF-free to draw inferences on
whether each of the rest is a DIF item, where the anchor items are used to
identify the latent trait distributions. When no prior information on anchor
items is available, item purification methods and regularized estimation
methods can be used. The former iteratively purifies the anchor set by a
stepwise model selection procedure, and the latter selects the DIF-free items
by a LASSO-type regularization approach. Unfortunately, unlike the methods
based on a correctly specified anchor set, these methods are not guaranteed to
provide valid statistical inference (e.g., confidence intervals and
$p$-values). In this paper, we propose a new method for DIF analysis under a
multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) model for DIF. This method
adopts a minimal $L_1$ norm condition for identifying the latent trait
distributions. Without requiring prior knowledge about an anchor set, it can
accurately estimate the DIF effects of individual items and further draw valid
statistical inferences for quantifying the uncertainty. Specifically, the
inference results allow us to control the type-I error for DIF detection, which
may not be possible with item purification and regularized estimation methods.
The proposed method is applied to analyzing the three personality scales of the

assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant

to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides
state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of
Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may
be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance.
Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable
Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation
performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features
in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications.
In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across
widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum
chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by
digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to
identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic
performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined
operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new
analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of
Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state,
and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for
addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying
theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that

(Monash and FRUITY). Depending on the ratio of the mean life $\tau$ of the SLR
to the average length of time between the formation of AGB progenitor $\gamma$,
we calculate timescales relevant for the birth of the Sun. If
$\tau/\gamma\gtrsim2$, we predict self-consistent isolation times between 9 and
26 Myr by decaying the GCE predicted $^{107}$Pd/$^{108}$Pd,
$^{135}$Cs/$^{133}$Cs, and $^{182}$Hf/$^{180}$Hf ratios to their respective ESS

component may have come from AGB stars of higher metallicity than those that
contributed to the ESS in our GCE code. If $\tau/\gamma\lesssim0.3$, we
calculate instead the time ($T_{\rm LE}$) from the last nucleosynthesis event

that when the above model is adopted, the clustering analysis combined with kSZ

comparing observed and predicted trajectories. Here, we introduce inverse

approximation to the propagation equation in the linear-quadratic Gaussian
problem with signal-dependent noise. We extend the model to the case of partial

sources of uncertainty, one must integrate over the uncertainty associated with
the model parameters, the known forward problem of uncertainty quantification.
In this paper, we make use of Langevin dynamics to solve the statFEM forward

convergence, for both the prior and posterior, in the Kullback-Leibler

structure data on protostars of a few tens of solar masses, where we expect to
see a transition from intermediate-mass star formation to the high-mass
process. We sought to derive the masses, luminosities, and envelope density
profiles for eight sources in Cygnus-X, whose mass estimates in the literature
placed them in the sampling gap. Combining these sources with similarly evolved
sources in the literature enabled us to perform a meta-analysis of protostellar
envelope parameters over six decades in source luminosity. We performed
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on archival broadband photometric
continuum data from 1.2 to 850 $\mu$m, to derive bolometric luminosities for
our eight sources plus initial mass and radius estimates for modelling density
and temperature profiles with the radiative transfer package Transphere. The
envelope masses, densities at 1000 AU, outer envelope radii, and density power
law indices as functions of bolometric luminosity all follow established trends
in the literature spanning six decades in luminosity. Most of our sources
occupy an intermediate to moderately high range of masses and luminosities,
which helps to more firmly establish the continuity between low- and high-mass
star formation mechanisms. Our density power law indices are consistent with
observed values in literature, which show no discernible trends with

the No-hair Theorem states that classical, isolated black holes eventually
settle to a stationary state that can be characterized by a small number of
parameters, cosmic black holes are neither isolated nor steady. Instead, they
interact with the environment and evolve on vastly different time-scales.
Therefore, the astrophysically realistic models require more parameters, and
their values likely change in time. New techniques are needed in order to allow
us to obtain independent constraints on these additional parameters. In this
context, non-electromagnetic messengers have emerged and a variety of novel
electromagnetic observations is going to supplement traditional techniques in
the near future. In this outline, we summarize several fruitful aspects of
electromagnetic signatures from accretion disks in strong-gravity regime in the
outlook of upcoming satellite missions and ground-based telescopes. As an
interesting example, we mention a purely geometrical effect of polarization
angle changes upon light propagation, which occurs near the black hole event
horizon. Despite that only numerical simulations can capture the accretion
process in a realistic manner, simplified toy-models and semi-analytical
estimates are useful to understand complicated effects of strong gravity near
the event horizon of a rotating black hole, and especially within the plunging
region below the innermost stable circular orbit.

are observed. With tuning coupling constants, the AFM-VBS transition vanishes
and instead, a gapless QSL phase gradually develops in between. Remarkably,
along the phase boundaries of AFM-QSL and QSL-VBS transitions, we always
observe the same correlation length exponents $\nu\approx 1.0$, which is
intrinsically different from the one of the DQCP-type transition, indicating
new types of universality classes. Our results explicitly demonstrate a new
scenario for understanding the emergence of gapless QSL from an underlying

determine the formulation except for two choices: i) the local domain itself

the quality of these two choices. The choice i) relates to the degree of
representativeness of a microscale sample, i.e., it is essentially a

network science. Mean-field theories of spin models on networks constitute a
fundamental tool to tackle this problem and a cornerstone of statistical
physics, with an impressive number of applications in condensed matter,
biology, and computer science. In this work we derive the mean-field equations
for the equilibrium behavior of vector spin models on high-connectivity random
networks with an arbitrary degree distribution and with randomly weighted
links. We demonstrate that the high-connectivity limit of spin models on
networks is not universal in that it depends on the full degree distribution.
Such nonuniversal behavior is akin to a remarkable mechanism that leads to the
breakdown of the central limit theorem when applied to the distribution of
effective local fields. Traditional mean-field theories on fully-connected
models, such as the Curie-Weiss, the Kuramoto, and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
model, are only valid if the network degree distribution is highly concentrated
around its mean degree. We obtain a series of results that highlight the
importance of degree fluctuations to the phase diagram of mean-field spin
models by focusing on the Kuramoto model of synchronization and on the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin-glasses. Numerical simulations
corroborate our theoretical findings and provide compelling evidence that the
present mean-field theory describes an intermediate regime of connectivity, in
which the average degree $c$ scales as a power $c \propto N^{b}$ ($b < 1$) of
the total number $N \gg 1$ of spins. Our findings put forward a novel class of

automated search-based approach for diagnosing performance issues in

combination of their Remote Procedure Call execution times, symptoms of
potentially relevant performance issues. We call such symptoms Latency
Degradation Patterns. DeLag simultaneously searches for multiple latency
degradation patterns while optimizing precision, recall and latency
dissimilarity. Experimentation on 700 datasets of requests generated from two
microservice-based systems shows that our approach provides better and more
stable effectiveness than three state-of-the-art approaches and general purpose
machine learning clustering algorithms. DeLag is more effective than all
baseline techniques in at least one case study (with p $\leq$ 0.05 and
non-negligible effect size). Moreover, DeLag outperforms in terms of efficiency
the second and the third most effective baseline techniques on the largest

of the Bose polaron. Motivated by the above, we employ the so-called Gross
Ansatz (GA) approach to unravel the stationary and dynamical properties of the
homogeneous one-dimensional Bose-polaron for different impurity momenta and
bath-impurity couplings. We explicate that the character of the equilibrium
state crossovers from the quasi-particle Bose polaron regime to the
collective-excitation stationary dark-bright soliton for varying impurity
momentum and interactions. Following an interspecies interaction quench the
temporal orthogonality catastrophe is identified, provided that bath-impurity
interactions are sufficiently stronger than the intraspecies bath ones, thus
generalizing the results of the confined case. This catastrophe originates from
the formation of dispersive shock wave structures associated with the
zero-range character of the bath-impurity potential. For initially moving
impurities, a momentum transfer process from the impurity to the dispersive
shock waves via the exerted drag force is demonstrated, resulting in a final
polaronic state with reduced velocity. Our results clearly demonstrate the
crucial role of non-linear excitations for determining the behavior of the
one-dimensional Bose polaron.

coalescence system where the mass of one of the companions is $\leq
5~M_{\odot}$ the nature of the object is ambiguous until the measurements of
tidal effects give evidence for the presence of a neutron star (NS) or a low
mass black hole (BH). The relevance of tidal effects in a neutron star--black
hole (NSBH) binary system depends crucially upon the mass and the spin of the
companion BH. These effects become important predominantly when the binary
system is of comparable mass and/or has large aligned spins. Depending upon the
masses and spins the NS can even get tidally disrupted before the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) is reached. The gravitational-wave signatures of
various tidal effects are encoded in the phasing of the signal and in the case
of tidal disruption an abrupt cutoff of the signal amplitude occurs. In this
work we show that tidal effects can also be captured by the nonlinear memory of
the GW signal. Although small in amplitude, nonlinear memory is present at low
frequency in contrast to the oscillatory GW signal. We introduce nonlinear
memory in the NSBH and binary black hole (BBH) waveform models and show how the
addition of memory aids in distinguishing NSBH systems from BBH systems for a

Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology from the quantum gravity
dynamics of group field theory (GFT), based on the idea that an FLRW universe
is characterised by a few macroscopic observables. Rather than relying on
assuming a particular type of quantum state and computing expectation values in
such a state, here we directly start from relations between macroscopic
observables (defined as one-body operators) and formulate dynamics only for
those observables. We apply the effective approach to constrained quantum
systems (as developed by Bojowald and collaborators) to GFT, providing a
systematic expansion in powers of $\hbar$. We obtain a kinematical phase space
of expectation values and moments, which does not require an a priori choice of
clock variable. We identify a gauge fixing of the system which corresponds to
choosing one of the cosmological variables (with the role of extrinsic
curvature) as a clock and which allows us to rewrite the effective dynamics in

securing IoT networks against known attacks. To increase the capability of an
IDS, researchers proposed the concept of blockchain-based Collaborative-IDS
(CIDS), wherein blockchain acts as a decentralised platform allowing
collaboration between CIDS nodes to share intrusion related information, such
as intrusion alarms and detection rules. However, proposals in blockchain-based
CIDS overlook the importance of continuous evaluation of the trustworthiness of
each node and generally work based on the assumption that the nodes are always
honest. In this paper, we propose a decentralised CIDS that emphasises the
importance of building trust between CIDS nodes. In our proposed solution, each
CIDS node exchanges detection rules to help other nodes detect new types of
intrusion. Our architecture offloads the trust computation to the blockchain
and utilises a decentralised storage to host the shared trustworthy detection
rules, ensuring scalability. Our implementation in a lab-scale testbed shows
that the our solution is feasible and performs within the expected benchmarks
of the Ethereum platform.

iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) with internal structure composed of nanorods are
compared with the widely used macrospin approximation. Such calculations
allowing for nanorod-composed NPs is facilitated by a previously developed
coarse-graining method based on the renormalization group approach. With a
focus on applications to magnetic hyperthermia, we show that magnetostatic
interactions improve the heating performance of NPs in chains and triangles,
and reduce heating performance in fcc arrangements. Hysteresis loops of
triangular and fcc systems of complex NPs are not recovered within the
macrospin approximation, especially at smaller interparticle distances. For
triangular arrangements, the macrospin approximation predicts that
magnetostatic interactions reduce loop area, in contrast to the complex NP
case. An investigation of the local hysteresis loops of individual NPs and
macrospins in clusters reveals the impact of the geometry of their neighbours
on individual versus collective magnetic response, inhomogenous heating within
clusters, and further differences between simulating NPs with internal
structure and the use of the macrospin approximation. Capturing the internal
physical and magnetic structure of NPs is thus important for some applications.

simplicity of evaluating the hyper-reduced well-chosen residuals. In this

reached prominence in photovoltaic solar cell efficiencies. Peculiarly, they
have shown, however, an asymmetry in their ability to be doped by holes rather
than by electrons. Indeed, both structural defect-induced doping as well as
extrinsic impurity-induced doping strangely result in a unipolar doping
(dominantly p-type) with low free carriers concentration. This raises the
question whether such doping limitations presents just a temporary setback due
to insufficient optimization of the doping process, or perhaps this represents
an intrinsic, physically-mandated bottleneck. In this paper we study three
fundamental Design Principles (DP's) for ideal doping, applying them via
density functional doping theory to these HP's, thus identifying the violated
DP that explains the doping limitations and asymmetry in these HP's. Here, the
target DP are: (i) requires that the thermodynamic transition level induced by
the dopants must ideally be energetically shallow both for donors (n-type) or
acceptors (p-type); DP-(ii) requires that the 'Fermi level pinning energies'
for electrons and holes (being the limiting values of the Fermi level before a
structural defect that compensate the doping forms spontaneously) should
ideally be located inside the conduction band for n-type doping and inside the
valence band for p-type doping. DP-(iii) requires that the doping-induced
equilibrium Fermi energy shifts towards the conduction band for n-type doping
(shift towards the valence band, for p-type doping) to be sufficiently large.
We find that, even though in HP's based on Br and Cl there are numerous shallow
level dopants that satisfy DP-(i), in contrast DP-(ii) is satisfied only for
holes and DP-(iii) fail for both holes and electrons, being the ultimate
bottleneck for the n-type doping in Iodine HP's.

can be more easily understood by examining patterns in heritability and

tool to better understand the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes,
especially helpful when designing more complicated systems where complex

Surprisingly, we observe a wide gap in accuracy of around 50% between the

important assessment in clinical practice. These patient-specific covariates
are often measured over multiple follow-up appointments. It is then of interest
to predict survival based on the history of these longitudinal measurements,
and to update predictions as more observations become available. The standard
approaches to these so-called `dynamic prediction' assessments are joint models
and landmark analysis. Joint models involve high-dimensional parametrisations,
and their computational complexity often prohibits including multiple
longitudinal covariates. Landmark analysis is simpler, but discards a
proportion of the available data at each `landmark time'. In this work we
propose a `retarded kernel' approach to dynamic prediction that sits somewhere
in between the two standard methods in terms of complexity. By conditioning
hazard rates directly on the covariate measurements over the observation time
frame, we define a model that takes into account the full history of covariate
measurements but is more practical and parsimonious than joint modelling.
Time-dependent association kernels describe the impact of covariate changes at
earlier times on the patient's hazard rate at later times. Under the
constraints that our model (i) reduces to the standard Cox model for
time-independent covariates, and (ii) contains the instantaneous Cox model as a
special case, we derive two natural kernel parameterisations. Upon application
to three clinical data sets, we find that the predictive accuracy of the
retarded kernel approach is comparable to that of the two existing standard
methods.

analyze the citations among the patents and the collaboration relations among

patent owners are not as well investigated. One proxy to model such relations
is the patent opposition, which is a legal activity in which a company
challenges the validity of a patent. Characterizing the patent oppositions,
collaborations, and the interplay between them can help better understand the
companies' business strategies. Temporality matters in this context as the
order and frequency of oppositions and collaborations characterize their
interplay. In this study, we construct a two-layer temporal network to model
the patent oppositions and collaborations among the companies. We utilize
temporal motifs to analyze the oppositions and collaborations from structural
and temporal perspectives. We first characterize the frequent motifs in patent
oppositions and investigate how often the companies of different sizes attack
other companies. We show that large companies tend to engage in opposition with
multiple companies. Then we analyze the temporal interplay between
collaborations and oppositions. We find that two adversarial companies are more
likely to collaborate in the future than two collaborating companies oppose
each other in the future.

role in today's high-performance automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this
paper we investigate a variety of asynchronous decentralized distributed
training strategies based on data parallel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to
show their superior performance over the commonly-used synchronous distributed
training via allreduce, especially when dealing with large batch sizes.
Specifically, we study three variants of asynchronous decentralized parallel
SGD (ADPSGD), namely, fixed and randomized communication patterns on a ring as
well as a delay-by-one scheme. We introduce a mathematical model of ADPSGD,
give its theoretical convergence rate, and compare the empirical convergence
behavior and straggler resilience properties of the three variants. Experiments
are carried out on an IBM supercomputer for training deep long short-term
memory (LSTM) acoustic models on the 2000-hour Switchboard dataset. Recognition
and speedup performance of the proposed strategies are evaluated under various
training configurations. We show that ADPSGD with fixed and randomized
communication patterns cope well with slow learners. When learners are equally
fast, ADPSGD with the delay-by-one strategy has the fastest convergence with
large batches. In particular, using the delay-by-one strategy, we can train the
acoustic model in less than 2 hours using 128 V100 GPUs with competitive word
error rates.

accurately reflects possible vorticity values that fluid parcels can possess

and atmosphere, at increasingly smaller scales and in sharply curved fronts,
its accuracy breaks down. This is because Earth's rotation imparts angular
momentum to fluid parcels and the conservation of absolute angular momentum $L$
restricts the range of centripetal accelerations possible in balanced flow;
this correspondingly restricts vorticity. To address this discrepancy, we
revisit Ertel's derivation and obtain a new conserved scalar $Lq$ that more
properly reflects the behavior of fluid parcels at these small horizontal

better understanding oceanic submesoscale and polar mesoscale flows.

augmentation followed by empirical risk minimization (DA-ERM) is a simple and

covaries with named entity when we augment data with a new named entity. In
this paper, we propose data augmented loss invariant regularization (DAIR), a

first-named author, up to two exceptions. For both of these exceptional cases,
we provide a pre-Nichols algebra that substitutes the distinguished one in the
sense that it projects onto all finite GK-dimensional pre-Nichols algebras. We
build these two substitutes as non-trivial central extensions with finite
GK-dimension of the corresponding distinguished pre-Nichols algebra. We
describe these algebras by generators and relations, and provide a basis.
  This work essentially completes the study of eminent pre-Nichols algebras of

signatures of quantum chaos already in the system with three particles.
Generally, these signatures become more pronounced when fermions are evenly

A Case Study in Continuous Control","Accepted to ICLR2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reinforcement learning (RL) experiments have notoriously high variance, and
minor details can have disproportionately large effects on measured outcomes.
This is problematic for creating reproducible research and also serves as an
obstacle for real-world applications, where safety and predictability are
paramount. In this paper, we investigate causes for this perceived instability.
To allow for an in-depth analysis, we focus on a specifically popular setup
with high variance -- continuous control from pixels with an actor-critic
agent. In this setting, we demonstrate that variance mostly arises early in
training as a result of poor ""outlier"" runs, but that weight initialization and
initial exploration are not to blame. We show that one cause for early variance
is numerical instability which leads to saturating nonlinearities. We
investigate several fixes to this issue and find that one particular method is
surprisingly effective and simple -- normalizing penultimate features.
Addressing the learning instability allows for larger learning rates, and
significantly decreases the variance of outcomes. This demonstrates that the
perceived variance in RL is not necessarily inherent to the problem definition
and may be addressed through simple architectural modifications.

accelerators in order to attain higher efficiency. While such a paradigm shift
is already starting to show promising results, designers need to spend
considerable manual effort and perform a large number of time-consuming
simulations to find accelerators that can accelerate multiple target
applications while obeying design constraints. Moreover, such a
""simulation-driven"" approach must be re-run from scratch every time the set of
target applications or design constraints change. An alternative paradigm is to
use a ""data-driven"", offline approach that utilizes logged simulation data, to
architect hardware accelerators, without needing any form of simulations. Such
an approach not only alleviates the need to run time-consuming simulation, but
also enables data reuse and applies even when set of target applications
changes. In this paper, we develop such a data-driven offline optimization
method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that enjoys all of
these properties. Our approach learns a conservative, robust estimate of the
desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design
against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during
optimization. PRIME architects accelerators -- tailored towards both single and
multiple applications -- improving performance upon state-of-the-art
simulation-driven methods by about 1.54x and 1.20x, while considerably reducing
the required total simulation time by 93% and 99%, respectively. In addition,
PRIME also architects effective accelerators for unseen applications in a

discuss multiple cost pricing scenarios for data owners to monetize their data.
Moreover, we simulate the incentive mechanisms on a blockchain-based

cervical cancer from 2007 to 2017 in Brunei Darussalam. The data were obtained
from the population-based cancer registry in Brunei Darussalam. Kaplan- Meier
survival analysis was used to estimate the overall survival rates at 1-, 3- and
5-year intervals while the log-rank test was used to assess differences in
survival between groups. Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) regression analysis was
used to examine the association of demographic and clinical factors on the
survival of cervical cancer patients. Results: A total of 329 registered
malignant cervical cancer cases were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of
patients with cervical cancer was 46.7 years. There were 28.6% deaths and the
overall survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 85.4%, 72.6% and 68.6%

Conclusion: Age at diagnosis, cancer stage and histology types were
significantly associated with the overall survival rates of cervical cancer

and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are considered as the
cornerstone of the development of optical sensors, security systems and
solid-state lighting. Nevertheless, molecular systems with these properties are
scarce because most of them suffer from aggregation caused quenching emission
(ACQ). One approach to address this shortcoming is by inhibiting the molecular
motions/vibrations by employing a fixed matrix as afforded by a metal-organic
framework (MOF). There, the organic chromophores are confined in a crystalline
framework, and the structure-property relationship can be designed to get
RTP/TADF. Inspired by this, the present work explores the relation between the
linker arrangement and the physicochemical properties of two isochemical MOFs
with different crystalline structures. The denser MOF exhibits a long-lived
green RTP due to a hyperfine coupling of the linkers. On the other hand, the
more porous MOF presents a long-lived temperature-dependent turquoise emission,
reflecting the influence of the TADF. Hence, this study provides a huge advance
about the potential of MOFs to undergo RTP and TADF emission, and at the same
time, demonstrates their potential applicability in a wide range of photonic
technologies, including physical and chemical sensing and the first example of
a MOF-LED based on RTP-MOFs.

models trained with supervision tend to make similar predictions. This
seemingly implies that high-performing models share similar biases regardless

low-accuracy models as having little practical use. Against this backdrop,
recent work has developed quite different training techniques, such as
large-scale contrastive learning, yielding competitively high accuracy on
generalization and robustness benchmarks. This motivates us to revisit the
assumption that models necessarily learn similar functions. We conduct a
large-scale empirical study of models across hyper-parameters, architectures,
frameworks, and datasets. We find that model pairs that diverge more in
training methodology display categorically different generalization behavior,
producing increasingly uncorrelated errors. We show these models specialize in
subdomains of the data, leading to higher ensemble performance: with just 2
models (each with ImageNet accuracy ~76.5%), we can create ensembles with 83.4%
(+7% boost). Surprisingly, we find that even significantly low-accuracy models
can be used to improve high-accuracy models. Finally, we show diverging
training methodology yield representations that capture overlapping (but not
supersetting) feature sets which, when combined, lead to increased downstream
performance.

epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) with immunohistochemical (IHC) is
widely used for pathological evaluation to provide the appropriate therapy for
patients with breast cancer. However, the deficiency of pathologists and
subjective and susceptible to inter-observer variation of visual diagnosis are
the main challenges. Recently, with the rapid development of artificial
intelligence (AI) in disease diagnosis, several automated HER2 scoring methods
using traditional computer vision or machine learning methods indicate the
improvement of the HER2 diagnostic accuracy, but the unreasonable
interpretation in pathology, as well as the expensive and ethical issues for
annotation, make these methods still have a long way to deploy in hospitals to
ease pathologists' burden in real. In this paper, we propose a HER2 automated
scoring system that strictly follows the HER2 scoring guidelines simulating the
real workflow of HER2 scores diagnosis by pathologists. Unlike the previous
work, our method considers the positive control of HER2 to make sure the assay
performance for each slide, eliminating work for repeated comparison between
the current field of view (FOV) and positive control FOV, especially for the
borderline cases. Besides, for each selected FOV under the microscope, our
system provides real-time HER2 scores analysis and visualizations of the
membrane staining intensity and completeness corresponding with the cell
classifications. Our rigorous workflow along with the flexible interactive
adjustion in demand substantially assists pathologists to finish the HER2
diagnosis faster and improves the robustness and accuracy. The proposed system
will be embedded in our Thorough Eye platform for deployment in hospitals.

their search, and currently, a great number of such classes is known.
Nonetheless, they have been exclusively sought in the setting of clausal form
and propositional logic, which is of course expressively limiting for real
applications. As a consequence, a first polynomial propositional class in
non-clausal (NC) form has recently been proposed. Along these lines and towards
making NC tractability applicable beyond propositional logic, firstly, we
define the Regular many-valued Horn Non-Clausal class, or RH, obtained by
suitably amalgamating both regular classes: Horn and NC. Secondly, we
demonstrate that the relationship between (1) RH and the regular Horn class is
that syntactically RH subsumes the Horn class but that both classes are
equivalent semantically; and between (2) RH and the regular non-clausal class
is that RH contains all NC formulas whose clausal form is Horn. Thirdly, we
define Regular Non-Clausal Unit-Resolution, or RUR-NC , and prove both that it
is complete for RH and that checks its satisfiability in polynomial time. The
latter fact shows that our intended goal is reached since RH is many-valued,
non-clausal and tractable. As RH and RUR-NC are, both, basic in the DPLL
scheme, the most efficient in propositional logic, and can be extended to some
other non-classical logics, we argue that they pave the way for efficient
non-clausal DPLL-based approximate reasoning.

the way to a number of interesting possibilities of theoretical and applied
nature. In the present work, after revising the main aspects of traditional
sets, we introduce some of the main concepts and characteristics of multisets,
followed by their generalization to take into account vectors and matrices. An
approach is also proposed in which the real, negative multiplicities are
allowed, implying the multiset universe to become finite and well-defined,
corresponding to the multiset with null multiplicities. The complement
operation in multisets is then defined, which allows properties involving
complement -- including the De Morgan theorem -- to be recovered in multisets.
In addition, it becomes possible to extend multisets to functions (which become
multifunctions), scalar fields and other continuous mathematical structure,
therefore achieving an enhanced space endowed with all algebraic operations
plus set theoretical operations including union, intersection, and
complementation. The possibility to define a set operation between mfunctions,
namely the common product, that is analogous to the traditional inner product
is also proposed, paving the way to obtaining respective mfunction
transformations, and it is argued that the Walsh functions provide an
orthogonal basis for the mfunctions space under the common product. This result
also allowed the proposal of performing integrated signal processing operations
on mset mfunctions, including filtering and enhanced template matching.
Relationships between the cosine similarity index and the Jaccard index are
also identified, including the presentation of an intersection-based variation
of the cosine index. The potential of multisets in pattern recognition and deep
learning is also briefly characterized and illustrated.

a contribution of several independent subnetworks. To identify these intrinsic
cognitive subnetworks corresponding to music perception, we propose to
decompose the whole brain graph-network into multiple subnetworks. We perform
this decomposition to a group of brain networks by performing Graph-Independent
Component Analysis. Graph-ICA is a variant of ICA that decomposes the measured
graph into independent source graphs. Having obtained independent subnetworks,
we calculate the electrode positions by computing the local maxima of these
subnetwork matrices. We observe that the computed electrodes' location
corresponds to the temporal lobes and the Broca's area, which are indeed
involved in the task of auditory processing and perception. The computed
electrodes also span the brain's frontal lobe, which is involved in attention
and generating a stimulus-evoked response. The weight of the subnetwork that
corresponds to the aforementioned brain regions increases with the increase in
the music recording's tempo. The results suggest that whole-brain networks can
be decomposed into independent subnetworks and analyze cognitive responses to
music stimulus.

during the interaction of a high-energy electron antineutrino with an electron,
peaking at an antineutrino energy of 6.3 petaelectronvolts (PeV) in the rest
frame of the electron. Whereas this energy scale is out of reach for currently
operating and future planned particle accelerators, natural astrophysical
phenomena are expected to produce antineutrinos with energies beyond the PeV
scale. Here we report the detection by the IceCube neutrino observatory of a
cascade of high-energy particles (a particle shower) consistent with being
created at the Glashow resonance. A shower with an energy of $6.05 \pm 0.72$
PeV (determined from Cherenkov radiation in the Antarctic Ice Sheet) was
measured. Features consistent with the production of secondary muons in the
particle shower indicate the hadronic decay of a resonant $W^-$ boson, confirm
that the source is astrophysical and provide improved directional localization.
The evidence of the Glashow resonance suggests the presence of electron
antineutrinos in the astrophysical flux, while also providing further
validation of the standard model of particle physics. Its unique signature
indicates a method of distinguishing neutrinos from antineutrinos, thus
providing a way to identify astronomical accelerators that produce neutrinos
via hadronuclear or photohadronic interactions, with or without strong magnetic
fields. As such, knowledge of both the flavour (that is, electron, muon or tau
neutrinos) and charge (neutrino or antineutrino) will facilitate the
advancement of neutrino astronomy.

  and convolution neural networks: A preliminary test",,,,,"physics.data-an cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this study, we present a method for classifying dynamical systems using a
hybrid approach involving recurrence plots and a convolution neural network
(CNN). This is performed by obtaining the recurrence matrix of a time series
generated from a given dynamical system and then using a CNN to classify the
related dynamics observed from the recurrence matrix. We consider three broad
classes of dynamics: chaotic, periodic, and stochastic. Using a relatively
simple CNN structure, we are able to obtain $\sim 90\%$ accuracy in
classification. The confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic
curve of classification demonstrate the strength and viability of this hybrid
approach.

sequences is proposed. This 'diffusive Omori-Utsu law' satisfies a nonlinear
partial differential equation (PDE). A similarity reduction is obtained that
reduces the PDE to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). A nonzero constant
solution of this ODE leads to the usual Omori-Utsu law. An exact and explicit
similarity solution is found that corresponds to the original Omori law. An
initial value problem for the 'diffusive Omori-Utsu law' is also considered,
and whose spatio-temporal dynamics are described by bounding functions that
satisfy nonlinear, but linearisable, PDEs. Numerical results are also provided.

real-time navigation. A case study in Salt Lake City shows that Google Maps
users are, on average, saving 1.7% of CO$_2$ emissions and 6.5% travel time. If
we restrict to the users for which Google Maps finds a different route than
their original route, the average savings are 3.4% of CO$_2$ emissions and
12.5% of travel time. These results are based on traffic conditions observed
during the Covid-19 pandemic. As congestion gradually builds back up to
pre-pandemic levels, it is expected to lead to even greater savings in
emissions.

asteroseismology. Based on the Optimally Localized Averaging method and a
simple three-zone modeling of the internal rotation, we have found evidence for
a contrast between the internal rotation of the radiative region and that of
the convective core; the radiative region rotates almost uniformly throughout
the region, but the convective core may be rotating about 6 times faster than
the radiative region above. We have also found a marginally significant
evidence of latitudinal differential rotation in the outer envelope. These
newly indicated features of the internal rotation of the star can help us
further constrain the theory of angular momentum transport inside stars as well
as understand the complex physical properties of the star, which was once
thought to be a main-sequence A-type star but recently has been proposed to be
a blue straggler, based on spectroscopy.

to a wide variety of tasks is astonishing. Insight in the working can be
obtained by studying the universal approximation property of neural networks.
It is proved extensively that neural networks are universal approximators.
Further it is proved that deep Neural networks are better approximators. It is
specifically proved that for a narrow neural network to approximate a function
which is otherwise implemented by a deep Neural network, the network take
exponentially large number of neurons. In this work, we have implemented
existing methodologies for a variety of synthetic functions and identified
their deficiencies. Further, we examined that Fourier neural network is able to
perform fairly good with only two layers in the neural network. A modified
Fourier Neural network which has sinusoidal activation and two hidden layer is
proposed and the results are tabulated.

representation of discrete and finite signals is FT convolution of the finite
sampling function and the continuous signal. Conventionally, finite sampling is
treated as a segment of infinite sampling. Though this approach perfectly
solves the difference between finite and infinite sampling, it has caused much
trouble for signal processing. Mathematically, there is a kind of sampling
between finite and infinite sampling, and we name this kind of sampling as
half-infinite sampling. Theoretically, finite sampling can also be treated as a
segment of half-infinite sampling. Because we can derive the Fourier
representation of discrete and finite signals from half-infinite sampling, the
FTs of several half-infinite samplings are studied. The results show that the
FT of half-infinite sampling is more concise than that of infinite sampling. A
numerical experiment verified the theoretical derivations successfully, during
which step sampling was proposed. Besides, several interesting equations were
built.
