  Community Detection","40 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables",,,,"cs.SI cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic community detection is the hotspot and basic problem of complex
network and artificial intelligence research in recent years. It is necessary
to maximize the accuracy of clustering as the network structure changes, but
also to minimize the two consecutive clustering differences between the two
results. There is a trade-off relationship between these two objectives. In
this paper, we propose a Feature Transfer Based Multi-Objective Optimization
Genetic Algorithm (TMOGA) based on transfer learning and traditional
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm framework. The main idea is to extract
stable features from past community structures, retain valuable feature
information, and integrate this feature information into current optimization
processes to improve the evolutionary algorithms. Additionally, a new
theoretical framework is proposed in this paper to analyze community detection
problem based on information theory. Then, we exploit this framework to prove
the rationality of TMOGA. Finally, the experimental results show that our
algorithm can achieve better clustering effects compared with the
state-of-the-art dynamic network community detection algorithms in diverse test
problems.

other perception systems such as body pose estimation, making it ideal for HRI
applications where force sensing is necessary. The introduced approach consists
of three main modules: finger tracking for detection and tracking of each
individual finger, image alignment for preserving the spatial information in
the images, and the force model for estimating the 3D forces from coloration
patterns in the images. The model has been implemented experimentally, and the
results have shown a maximum RMS error of 8.4% (for the entire range of force
levels) along all three directions. The estimation accuracy is comparable to
the offline models in the literature, such as EigneNail, while, this model is
capable of performing force estimation at 30 frames per second.

solid-state Si detectors placed at 165 degrees and 150 degrees relative to each
side of the incident beam direction was used to measure the energies of the
scattered ions and determine their energy losses within the stopping medium. In
this way, the basic energy parameter, Ex, at the Si-SiO2 interface for a given

both the Si and O target elements, and systematic uncertainties in the S (E)

A powerful computer code has been elaborated for extracting the relevant S (E)
experimental data and the associated overall uncertainty that amounts to less
than 3%. The measured S (E) data sets were found to be in fair agreement with
H. Paul compilation and with values calculated by the SRIM 06 computer code. In
the case of 4He+ ions, experimental data for the gamma-effective charge
parameter have been deduced via scaling the measured stopping cross sections to
those for protons crossing the same target at the same velocity and compared to
the predictions of the SRIM 06 code. It is found that the gamma-parameter
values generated by the latter code slightly deviate from experiment over the
velocity region around the stopping cross section maximum where strong charge

system, or of robotic grasping in general. A sparse, goal-based reward is
employed in conjunction with Hindsight Experience Replay to teach the control
policy to move the cube to the desired x and y coordinates of the goal.
Simultaneously, a dense distance-based reward is employed to teach the policy
to lift the cube to the z coordinate (the height component) of the goal. The
policy is trained in simulation with domain randomisation before being
transferred to the real robot for evaluation. Although performance tends to
worsen after this transfer, our best policy can successfully lift the real cube

outperforms all other submissions, including those leveraging more traditional
robotic control techniques, and is the first pure learning-based method to

producing fast and accurate predictions of the nonlinear galaxy power spectrum.
The suite of emulators consists of four linear component emulators, from which
fast linear predictions of the power spectrum can be made, allowing all
nonlinearities to be included in predictions from a nonlinear boost component
emulator. The linear component emulators includes an emulator for the matter
transfer function that produces predictions in $\sim 0.0004 \ \mathrm{s}$, with
an error of $<0.08\%$ (at $1\sigma$ level) on scales $10^{-4} \ h \
\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}<k<10^1 \ h \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In this paper we demonstrate
$\texttt{matryoshka}$ by training the nonlinear boost component emulator with
analytic training data calculated with HALOFIT, that has been designed to
replicate training data that would be generated using numerical simulations.
Combining all the component emulator predictions we achieve an accuracy of $<
0.75\%$ (at $1\sigma$ level) when predicting the real space nonlinear galaxy
power spectrum on scales $0.0025 \ h \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}<k<1 \ h \

the analysis setup on cosmological constraints by conducting several full shape
analyses of the real space galaxy power spectrum. Specifically we investigate
the impact of the minimum scale (or $k_\mathrm{max}$), finding an improvement
of $\sim 1.8\times$ in the constraint on $\sigma_8$ by pushing $k_\mathrm{max}$
from $k_\mathrm{max}=0.25 \ h \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $k_\mathrm{max}=0.85 \ h

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), of the merging galaxy cluster MACS J0717.5+3745,
which hosts one of the most complex known radio relic and halo systems. We use
both Rotation Measure Synthesis and QU-fitting, and find a reasonable agreement
of the results obtained with these methods, in particular, when the Faraday
distribution is simple and the depolarization is mild. The relic is highly
polarized over its entire length reaching a fractional polarization ${>}30\%$
in some regions. We also observe a strong wavelength-dependent depolarization
for some regions of the relic. The northern part of the relic shows a complex
Faraday distribution suggesting that this region is located in or behind the
intracluster medium (ICM). Conversely, the southern part of the relic shows a
Rotation Measure very close to the Galactic foreground, with a rather low
Faraday dispersion, indicating very little magnetoionic material intervening
the line-of-sight. From spatially resolved polarization analysis, we find that
the scatter of Faraday depths correlates with the depolarization, indicating
that the tangled magnetic field in the ICM causes the depolarization. At the
position of a well known narrow-angle-tailed galaxy (NAT), we find evidence of
two components clearly separated in Faraday space. The high Faraday dispersion
component seems to be associated with the NAT, suggesting the NAT is embedded
in the ICM while the southern part of the relic lies in front of it. The
magnetic field orientation follows the relic structure indicating a
well-ordered magnetic field. We also detect polarized emission in the halo
region; however the absence of significant Faraday rotation and a low value of
Faraday dispersion suggests the polarized emission, previously considered as
the part of the halo, has a shock(s) origin.

particles and their acceleration mechanisms at low shock speeds. We present an
analysis of the $\gamma$-ray emission detected by the Large Area Telescope on
board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope over 11 years in the region of the
Cygnus Loop. We performed detailed morphological and spectral studies of the
$\gamma$-ray emission toward the remnant from 100 MeV to 100 GeV and compared
it with X-ray, UV, optical, and radio images. The higher statistics with
respect to the previous studies enabled us to decompose the emission from the
remnant into two morphological components to model its nonthermal
multiwavelength emission. The extended $\gamma$-ray emission is well correlated
with the thermal X-ray and UV emission of the SNR. Our morphological analysis
reveals that a model considering two contributions from the X-ray and the UV
emission regions is the best description of the $\gamma$-ray data. Both
components show a curved spectrum, but the X-ray component is softer and more
curved than the UV component, suggesting a different physical origin. The
multiwavelength modeling of emission toward the SNR suggests that the
nonthermal radio and $\gamma$-ray emission associated with the UV component is
mostly due to the reacceleration of preexisting cosmic rays by radiative shocks
in the adjacent clouds, while the nonthermal emission associated with the X-ray
component arises from freshly accelerated cosmic rays.

specifically we reduce the problem of finding a realization to that of finding
a positive point in a variety and try to find a polynomial with positive

non-realizability developed in the last three decades can be seen as following
this framework, using more or less elaborate ways of constructing such positive
polynomials. Our proposal is more straightforward as we simply use linear

the timescales of accretion and differentiation of some of the oldest
planetesimals of the Solar System. Determining accurate Hf-W model ages of iron
meteorites requires correction for cosmic ray expo-sure (CRE) induced
modifications of W isotope compositions, which can be achieved using in-situ
neutron dosimeters such as Pt isotopes. Until now it has been assumed that all
Pt isotope variations in meteorites reflect CRE, but here we show that some
ungrouped iron meteorites display small nucleosynthetic Pt isotope anomalies.
These provide the most appropriate starting composition for the correction of
CRE-induced W isotope variations in iron meteorites from all major chemical
groups, which leads to a ~1 Ma upward revision of previously reported Hf-W
model ages. The revised ages indicate that core formation in non-carbonaceous
(NC) iron meteorite parent bodies occurred at ~1-2 Ma after CAI formation,
whereas most carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorite parent bodies underwent core
formation ~2 Ma later. We show that the younger CC cores have lower Fe/Ni
ratios than the earlier-formed NC cores, indicating that core formation under
more oxidizing conditions occurred over a more protracted timescale. Thermal
modeling of planetesimals heated by 26Al-decay reveals that this protracted
core formation timescale is consistent with a higher fraction of water ice in
CC compared to NC planetesimals, implying that in spite of distinct core
formation timescales, NC and CC iron meteorite parent bodies accreted about
contemporaneously within ~1 Ma after CAI formation, but at different radial
locations in the disk.

is easy to understand for patients, and has a short administration. However, it
has important limitations. First, the underlying EFs articulated during the
task are not well discriminated, which makes it a test with low specificity.
Second, the traditional pen-and-paper version presents one trial per condition
which introduces high variability. Third, only the total time is quantified,
which does not allow for a detailed analysis. Fourth, it has a fixed spatial
configuration per condition. In the present study we designed a computerized
version of the TMT (cTMT) to overcome its main limitations. Eye and hand
positions are simultaneously measured with high resolution, several trials are
acquired, and spatial configuration of the targets is controlled. Our results
showed a very similar performance profile compared to the traditional TMT.
Moreover, it revealed similarities and differences in eye movements between the
two parts of the task. Most importantly, we found an internal working memory
measure of the cTMT based on hand and eye movements that showed an association
to a validated working memory task. Additionally, we found another internal
measure of the TMT, also based on hand and eye movements, that we propose as a
potential marker of inhibitory control. Our results showed that executive
functions can be studied in more detail using traditional tests combined with
powerful digital setups. Finally, our study paved the way for a detailed
analysis of other complex tasks used for clinical evaluation, providing a

allowing the recombination of known parts to create novel expressions. However,
existing neural models have been shown to lack this basic ability in learning
symbolic structures. Motivated by the failure of a Transformer model on the
SCAN compositionality challenge (Lake and Baroni, 2018), which requires parsing
a command into actions, we propose two auxiliary sequence prediction tasks that
track the progress of function and argument semantics, as additional training
supervision. These automatically-generated sequences are more representative of
the underlying compositional symbolic structures of the input data. During
inference, the model jointly predicts the next action and the next tokens in
the auxiliary sequences at each step. Experiments on the SCAN dataset show that
our method encourages the Transformer to understand compositional structures of
the command, improving its accuracy on multiple challenging splits from <= 10%
to 100%. With only 418 (5%) training instances, our approach still achieves
97.8% accuracy on the MCD1 split. Therefore, we argue that compositionality can
be induced in Transformers given minimal but proper guidance. We also show that
a better result is achieved using less contextualized vectors as the
attention's query, providing insights into architecture choices in achieving
systematic compositionality. Finally, we show positive generalization results

distributed mobile data in a wireless network. It features data parallelism by
distributing the learning task to multiple edge devices while attempting to
preserve their local-data privacy. One main challenge confronting practical FL
is that resource constrained devices struggle with the computation intensive
task of updating of a deep-neural network model. To tackle the challenge, in
this paper, a federated dropout (FedDrop) scheme is proposed building on the
classic dropout scheme for random model pruning. Specifically, in each
iteration of the FL algorithm, several subnets are independently generated from
the global model at the server using dropout but with heterogeneous dropout
rates (i.e., parameter-pruning probabilities),each of which is adapted to the
state of an assigned channel. The subnets are downloaded to associated devices
for updating. Thereby, FedDrop reduces both the communication overhead and
devices' computation loads compared with the conventional FL while
outperforming the latter in the case of overfitting and also the FL scheme with
uniform dropout (i.e., identical subnets).

numerous applicable devices and systems are created based on modern physics and
state-of-the-art nanotechnologies. The implementation of quantum mechanics has
been the driving force of the most intriguing design of photonic structures,
since the optical systems are found of great capability and potential in
realizing the analogues of quantum concepts and phenomena. Non-Hermitian
physics, which breaks the conventional scope of quantum mechanics based on
Hermitian Hamiltonian, has been widely explored in the platform of silicon
photonics, with promising design of optical refractive index, modal coupling
and gain-loss distribution. As we will discuss in this chapter, the
unconventional properties of exceptional points and parity-time symmetry
realized in silicon photonics have created new opportunities for ultrasensitive
sensors, laser engineering, control of light propagation, topological mode
conversion, etc. The marriage between the quantum non-Hermiticity and classical
silicon platforms not only spurs numerous studies on the fundamental physics,
but also enriches the potential functionalities of the integrated photonic
systems.

fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and adverse health outcomes. Recently, many of
these studies have begun to employ high-resolution predicted PM2.5
concentrations, which are subject to measurement error. Previous approaches for
exposure measurement error correction have either been applied in non-causal
settings or have only considered a categorical exposure. Moreover, most
procedures have failed to account for uncertainty induced by error correction
when fitting an exposure-response function (ERF). To remedy these deficiencies,
we develop a multiple imputation framework that combines regression calibration
and Bayesian techniques to estimate a causal ERF. We demonstrate how the output
of the measurement error correction steps can be seamlessly integrated into a
Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) estimator of the causal ERF. We also
demonstrate how locally-weighted smoothing of the posterior samples from BART
can be used to create a more accurate ERF estimate. Our proposed approach also
properly propagates the exposure measurement error uncertainty to yield
accurate standard error estimates. We assess the robustness of our proposed
approach in an extensive simulation study. We then apply our methodology to
estimate the effects of PM2.5 on all-cause mortality among Medicare enrollees
in New England from 2000-2012.

components of safe autonomous vehicles (AVs). The nature of the

neglected aspect of such systems. We address this issue by modeling a Markov
decision process (MDP) for a simulated AV-pedestrian interaction at an unmarked
crosswalk. The AV's PCAM decision policy is learned through deep reinforcement
learning (DRL). Since modeling pedestrians realistically is challenging, we
compare two levels of intelligent pedestrian behavior. While the baseline model
follows a predefined strategy, our advanced pedestrian model is defined as a
second DRL agent. This model captures continuous learning and the uncertainty
inherent in human behavior, making the AV-pedestrian interaction a deep
multi-agent reinforcement learning (DMARL) problem. We benchmark the developed
PCAM systems according to the collision rate and the resulting traffic flow
efficiency with a focus on the influence of observation uncertainty on the
decision-making of the agents. The results show that the AV is able to
completely mitigate collisions under the majority of the investigated
conditions and that the DRL pedestrian model learns an intelligent crossing

process that transports energy over large distances and helps determine the
spatial variation of temperature. High-density regions undergoing rapid
particle-particle collisions exhibit a heat flux described well by classical
Spitzer-Harm theory. However, much of the heliosphere is closer to a more
collisionless state, and there is no standard description of heat conduction
for fluid-based (e.g., magnetohydrodynamic) models that applies generally. Some
proposed models rely on electron velocity distributions that exhibit negative
values of the phase-space density. In this paper, we explore how
positive-definite velocity distributions can be used in fluid-based
conservation equations for the electron heat flux along magnetic-field lines in
the corona and solar wind. We study both analytic forms of skewed distributions
(e.g., skew-normal distributions, two-sided bi-Maxwellians, and
constant-collision-time electrostatic solutions) and empirical fits to
measurements of core, halo, and strahl electrons in interplanetary space. We
also present example solutions to a generalized conservation equation for the
heat flux in the solar wind, with some limiting cases found to resemble known
free-streaming approximations. The resulting values of the electron heat flux
vary as a function of radial distance and Knudsen number in ways that resemble
observed data. We note that this model does not include the effects of kinetic
instabilities (which may impose saturation limits when active), so for now its
regime of applicability is limited to collisionless heat-flux evolution away
from the known instability boundaries in parameter space.

random vertex-weights and new vertices connect to a predecessor with a
probability proportional to its weight. Here, we study the maximum degree and
near-maximum degrees in weighted recursive trees when the vertex-weights are
almost surely bounded and their distribution function satisfies a mild
regularity condition near zero. We are able to specify higher-order corrections
to the first order growth of the maximum degree established in prior work. The
accuracy of the results depends on the behaviour of the weight distribution
near the largest possible value and in certain cases we manage to find the
corrections up to random order. Additionally, we describe the tail distribution
of the maximum degree, the distribution of the number of vertices attaining the
maximum degree, and establish asymptotic normality of the number of vertices
with near-maximum degree. Our analysis extends the results proved for random
recursive trees (where the weights are constant) to the case of random weights.
The main technical result shows that the degrees of several uniformly chosen
vertices are asymptotically independent with explicit error corrections.

developed in the setting of vector spaces over a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$,
with applications mainly in ergodic theory. A key requisite for this
development is to identify a class of nilspaces adequate for this setting. We
introduce such a class, whose members we call $p$-homogeneous nilspaces. One of
our main results characterizes these objects in terms of a simple algebraic
property. We then prove various further results on these nilspaces, leading to
a structure theorem describing every finite $p$-homogeneous nilspace as the
image, under a nilspace fibration, of a member of a simple family of filtered
finite abelian $p$-groups. The applications include a description of the
Host-Kra factors of ergodic $\mathbb{F}_p^\omega$-systems as $p$-homogeneous
nilspace systems. This enables the analysis of these factors to be reduced to
the study of such nilspace systems, with central questions on the factors thus
becoming purely algebraic problems on finite nilspaces. We illustrate this
approach by proving that for $k\leq p+1$ the $k$-th Host-Kra factor is an
Abramov system of order $\leq k$, extending a result of Bergelson-Tao-Ziegler
that holds for $k< p$. We illustrate the utility of $p$-homogeneous nilspaces
also by showing that the above-mentioned structure theorem yields a new proof
of the Tao-Ziegler inverse theorem for Gowers norms on $\mathbb{F}_p^n$.

problem: the goal is to scale the rows and columns of a given non-negative
matrix such that the rescaled matrix has prescribed row and column sums.
Motivated by recent results on first-order quantum algorithms for matrix
scaling, we investigate the possibilities for quantum speedups for classical
second-order algorithms, which comprise the state-of-the-art in the classical
setting.
  We first show that there can be essentially no quantum speedup in terms of
the input size in the high-precision regime: any quantum algorithm that solves
the matrix scaling problem for $n \times n$ matrices with at most $m$ non-zero
entries and with $\ell_2$-error $\varepsilon=\widetilde\Theta(1/m)$ must make
$\widetilde\Omega(m)$ queries to the matrix, even when the success probability
is exponentially small in $n$. Additionally, we show that for
$\varepsilon\in[1/n,1/2]$, any quantum algorithm capable of producing
$\frac{\varepsilon}{100}$-$\ell_1$-approximations of the row-sum vector of a
(dense) normalized matrix uses $\Omega(n/\varepsilon)$ queries, and that there
exists a constant $\varepsilon_0>0$ for which this problem takes
$\Omega(n^{1.5})$ queries.
  To complement these results we give improved quantum algorithms in the
low-precision regime: with quantum graph sparsification and amplitude
estimation, a box-constrained Newton method can be sped up in the
large-$\varepsilon$ regime, and outperforms previous quantum algorithms. For
entrywise-positive matrices, we find an $\varepsilon$-$\ell_1$-scaling in time
$\widetilde O(n^{1.5}/\varepsilon^2)$, whereas the best previously known bounds
were $\widetilde O(n^2\mathrm{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$ (classical) and
$\widetilde O(n^{1.5}/\varepsilon^3)$ (quantum).

analysis. Recently published approaches have achieved promising overall
performance on nuclei segmentation; however, their performance on separating
overlapped nuclei is quite limited. To address the issue, we propose a novel
multitask learning network with a bending loss regularizer to separate
overlapped nuclei accurately. The newly proposed multitask learning
architecture enhances the generalization by learning shared representation from
three tasks: instance segmentation, nuclei distance map prediction, and
overlapped nuclei distance map prediction. The proposed bending loss defines
high penalties to concave contour points with large curvatures, and applies
small penalties to convex contour points with small curvatures. Minimizing the
bending loss avoids generating contours that encompass multiple nuclei. In
addition, two new quantitative metrics, Aggregated Jaccard Index of overlapped
nuclei (AJIO) and Accuracy of overlapped nuclei (ACCO), are designed for the
evaluation of overlapped nuclei segmentation. We validate the proposed approach
on the CoNSeP and MoNuSegv1 datasets using seven quantitative metrics:
Aggregate Jaccard Index, Dice, Segmentation Quality, Recognition Quality,
Panoptic Quality, AJIO, and ACCO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed Bend-Net outperforms eight state-of-the-art approaches.

with different LiDAR setups which drastically decreases their performance.
Fine-tuning the model for every new setup is infeasible due to the expensive
and cumbersome process of recording and manually labeling new data.
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques are thus essential to fill this
domain gap and retain the performance of models on new sensor setups without
the need for additional data labeling. In this paper, we propose AdaptLPS, a
novel UDA approach for LiDAR panoptic segmentation that leverages task-specific
knowledge and accounts for variation in the number of scan lines, mounting
position, intensity distribution, and environmental conditions. We tackle the
UDA task by employing two complementary domain adaptation strategies,
data-based and model-based. While data-based adaptations reduce the domain gap
by processing the raw LiDAR scans to resemble the scans in the target domain,
model-based techniques guide the network in extracting features that are
representative for both domains. Extensive evaluations on three pairs of
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that AdaptLPS outperforms
existing UDA approaches by up to 6.41 pp in terms of the PQ score.

There is a critical need of developing powerful testing procedures against more
general alternatives. This paper studies the joint test of two-sample mean
vectors and covariance matrices for high-dimensional data. We first expand the
high-power region of high-dimensional mean tests or covariance tests to a wider
alternative space and then combine their strengths together in the simultaneous
test. We develop a new power-enhanced simultaneous test that is powerful to
detect differences in either mean vectors or covariance matrices under either
sparse or dense alternatives. We prove that the proposed testing procedures

achieve the accurate asymptotic size and consistent asymptotic power. We
demonstrate the finite-sample performance using simulation studies and a real

We demonstrate theoretically that an excited chiral molecule accumulates an

first, kink-like configurations in two dimensional spacetime, second, vortex

presented. On the other hand, for the study of topological vortices, we
reorganized the energy density to obtain, for convenience, equations similar to

localized energy and quantized magnetic flux in a given topological sector. We
also show that when the model does not spontaneously break the symmetry, the

eigenstate, has been widely used from studying ground state properties of
chemistry and condensed matter quantum physics, to general optimization
problems. However, the cooling procedure is generally non-unitary, hence its
realization on a quantum computer either requires deep circuits or assumes
specific input states with variational circuits. Here, we propose universal
quantum cooling algorithms that overcome these limitations. By utilizing a dual
phase representation of decaying functions, we show how to universally and
deterministically realize a general cooling procedure with shallow quantum
circuits. We demonstrate its applications in cooling an arbitrary input state
with known ground state energy, corresponding to satisfactory, linear algebra
tasks, and quantum state compiling tasks, and preparing unknown eigenvalues and
eigenstates, corresponding to quantum many-body problems. Compared to quantum
phase estimation, our method uses only one ancillary qubit and much shallower
circuits, showing exponential improvement of the circuit complexity with
respect to the final state infidelity. We numerically benchmark the algorithms
for the $8$-qubit Heisenberg model and verify its feasibility for accurately
finding eigenenergies and obtaining eigenstate measurements. Our work paves the
way for efficient and universal quantum algorithmic cooling with near-term as
well as universal fault-tolerant quantum devices.

this mapping and take very complicated expressions in terms of the spinless

quench dynamics from product states in the occupation basis can be determined
exactly in terms of correlations in the tight-binding model. In particular, we
show that the time evolution of any function of the total density of particles
is mapped directly into that of the same function of the density of spinless

number must break the time reversal symmetry, manifested by the appearance of
chiral edge modes on an open boundary. Such an incompatibility between topology

enforced symmetry breaking by topological orders. In this work, we
systematically study enforced breaking of a general finite group $G_f$ by a
class of topological orders, namely 0D, 1D and 2D fermionic invertible
topological orders. Mathematically, the symmetry group $G_f$ is a central
extension of a bosonic group $G$ by the fermion parity group $Z_2^f$,
characterized by a 2-cocycle $\lambda$ $\in H^2(G,Z_2)$. With some minor
assumptions and for given $G$ and $\lambda$, we are able to obtain a series of
criteria on the existence or non-existence of enforced symmetry breaking by the
fermionic invertible topological orders. Using these criteria, we discover many
examples that are not known previously. For 2D systems, we define the physical
quantities to describe symmetry-enriched invertible topological orders and
derive some obstruction functions using both fermionic and bosonic languages.
In the latter case which is done via gauging the fermion parity, we find that
some obstruction functions are consequences of conditional anomalies of the
bosonic symmetry-enriched topological states, with the conditions inherited
from the original fermionic system. We also study enforced breaking of the
continuous group $SU_f(N)$ by 2D invertible topological orders through a

curves from Fermi/GBM, in order to infer properties of coronal magnetic
reconnection. As the event progresses, two flare ribbons spread away from the
magnetic polarity inversion line. The width of the newly brightened front along
the extension of the ribbon is highly intermittent in both space and time,
presumably reflecting non-uniformities in the structure and/or dynamics of the
flare current sheet. Furthermore, the ribbon width grows most rapidly in
regions exhibiting concentrated non-thermal HXR emission, with sharp increases
slightly preceding the HXR bursts. The light curve of the ultraviolet emission
matches the HXR light curve at photon energies above 25 keV. In other regions
the ribbon-width evolution and light curves do not temporally correlate with
the HXR emission. This indicates that the production of non-thermal electrons
is highly non-uniform within the flare current sheet. Our results suggest a
strong connection between the production of non-thermal electrons and the
locally enhanced perpendicular extent of flare ribbon fronts, which in turn
reflects inhomogeneous structure and/or reconnection dynamics of the current
sheet. Despite this variability, the ribbon fronts remain nearly continuous,
quasi-one-dimensional features. Thus, although the reconnecting coronal current
sheets are highly structured, they remain quasi-two-dimensional and the
magnetic energy release occurs systematically, rather than stochastically,
through the volume of reconnecting magnetic flux.

T, act naively as $\mathbb{Z}_2$-involutions in the passive transformation on
the spacetime coordinates; but together with a charge conjugation C, the total
C-P-R-T symmetries have enriched active transformations on fields in
representations of the spacetime-internal symmetry groups of quantum field
theories (QFTs). In this work, we derive that these symmetries can be further
fractionalized, especially in the presence of the fermion parity $(-1)^{\rm
F}$. We elaborate on examples including relativistic Lorentz invariant QFTs
(e.g., spin-1/2 Dirac or Majorana spinor fermion theories) and nonrelativistic
quantum many-body systems (involving Majorana zero modes), and comment on
applications to spin-1 Maxwell electromagnetism (QED) or interacting Yang-Mills
(QCD) gauge theories. We discover various C-P-R-T-$(-1)^{\rm F}$ group
structures, e.g., Dirac spinor is in a projective representation of
$\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm C}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm P} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm T}$
but in an (anti)linear representation of an order-16 nonabelian finite group,
as the central product between an order-8 dihedral (generated by C and P) or
quaternion group and an order-4 group generated by T with T$^2=(-1)^{\rm F}$.
The general theme may be coined as C-P-T or C-R-T fractionalization.

feature that enables such measurement is the detailed event reconstruction
capability of liquid argon time projection chambers. This allows for studying
the sub-GeV atmospheric neutrino component, which bears a rich oscillation
phenomenology, strongly dependent on the matter potential sourced by the Earth.
We provide a pedagogical discussion of the MSW and parametric resonances and
their role in measuring the core and mantle densities. By performing a detailed
simulation, accounting for particle reconstruction at DUNE, nuclear physics
effects relevant to neutrino-argon interactions and several uncertainties on
the atmospheric neutrino flux, we manage to obtain a robust estimate of DUNE's
sensitivity to the Earth matter profile. We find that DUNE can measure the
total mass of the Earth at 8.4% precision with an exposure of 400~kton-year. By
accounting for previous measurements of the total mass and moment of inertia of
the Earth, the core, lower mantle and upper mantle densities can be determined
with 8.8%, 13% and 22% precision, respectively, for the same exposure. Finally,
DUNE could take atmospheric neutrino data while the beam is being commissioned
and far detector modules are up and running. For a low exposure run of
60~kton-year, which would correspond to two far detectors running for three
years, we have found that the core density could be measured by DUNE at
$\sim30\%$ precision.

  evolution of star forming galaxies","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stab2859",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two currently debated problems in galaxy evolution, the fundamentally local
or global nature of the main sequence of star formation and the evolution of
the mass-size relation of star forming galaxies (SFGs), are shown to be
intimately related to each other. As a preliminary step, a growth function $g$
is defined, which quantifies the differential change in half-mass radius per
unit increase in stellar mass ($g = d \log R_{1/2}/d \log M_\star$) due to star
formation. A general derivation shows that $g = K \Delta(sSFR)/sSFR$, meaning
that $g$ is proportional to the relative difference in specific star formation
rate between the outer and inner half of a galaxy, with $K$ a dimensionless
structural factor for which handy expressions are provided. As an application,
it is shown that galaxies obeying a fundamentally local main sequence also
obey, to a good approximation, $g \simeq \gamma n$, where $\gamma$ is the slope
of the normalized local main sequence ($sSFR \propto \Sigma_\star^{-\gamma}$)
and $n$ the Sersic index. An exact expression is also provided. Quantitatively,
a fundamentally local main sequence is consistent with SFGs growing along a
stationary mass-size relation, but inconsistent with the continuation at $z=0$
of evolutionary laws derived at higher $z$. This demonstrates that either the
main sequence is not fundamentally local, or the mass-size relation of SFGs has
converged to an equilibrium state some finite time in the past, or both.

major challenges. First, the brightness is significantly reduced at long
submillimeter wavelengths compared to the brightness at the peak of the dust

atmospheric noise on large angular scales, which has the unwelcome by-product
of also removing the galaxy's large-scale structure. We have developed a
technique for producing high-resolution submillimeter images of galaxies of
large angular size by using the telescope on the ground to determine the
small-scale structure (the large Fourier components) and a space telescope
(Herschel or Planck) to determine the large-scale structure (the small Fourier
components). Using this technique, we are carrying out the HARP and SCUBA-2
High Resolution Terahertz Andromeda Galaxy Survey (HASHTAG), an international
Large Program on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, with one aim being to
produce the first high-fidelity high-resolution submillimeter images of
Andromeda. In this paper, we describe the survey, the method we have developed
for combining the space-based and ground-based data, and present the first
HASHTAG images of Andromeda at 450 and 850um. We also have created a method to
predict the CO(J=3-2) line flux across M31, which contaminates the 850um band.
We find that while normally the contamination is below our sensitivity limit,
the contamination can be significant (up to 28%) in a few of the brightest
regions of the 10 kpc ring. We therefore also provide images with the predicted

We show that LIM surveys deployable this decade, in combination with existing

cluster or locally dense environments, suggesting starkly different star
formation histories for UDGs residing in high and low-density environments. Of
the 16 large ($r_e \geq 3.5$ kpc) UDGs in our sample, only one is a field
galaxy that falls near the early-type galaxy red sequence. No other field UDGs
found in low density environments fall near the red sequence. This finding, in
combination with our detection of GALEX NUV flux in nearly half of the UDGs in
sparse environments, suggest that field UDGs are a population of slowly
evolving galaxies.

Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) have measured that the largest counterterms
are the redshift-space distortion ones. This allows us to adjust the
power-counting rules of the theory, and to explicitly identify that the leading
next-order terms have a specific dependence on the cosine of the angle between
the line-of-sight and the wavenumber of the observable, $\mu$. Such a specific
$\mu$-dependence allows us to construct a linear combination of the data
multipoles, $\slashed{P}$, where these contributions are effectively projected
out, so that EFTofLSS predictions for $\slashed{P}$ have a much smaller
theoretical error and so a much higher $k$-reach. The remaining data are
organized in wedges in $\mu$ space, have a $\mu$-dependent $k$-reach because
they are not equally affected by the leading next-order contributions, and
therefore can have a higher $k$-reach than the multipoles. Furthermore, by
explicitly including the highest next-order terms, we define a `one-loop+'
procedure, where the wedges have even higher $k$-reach. We study the
effectiveness of these two procedures on several sets of simulations and on the
BOSS data. The resulting analysis has identical computational cost as the
multipole-based one, but leads to an improvement on the determination of some
of the cosmological parameters that ranges from $10\%$ to $100\%$, depending on
the survey properties.

via random interactions following quenches from the perspective of
entanglement. Previous studies have shown that when a system of two SYK models
coupled by random two-body terms is quenched from the thermofield double state
with sufficiently low effective temperature, the R\'enyi entropies do not
saturate to the expected thermal values in the large-$N$ limit. Using numerical
large-$N$ methods, we first show that the R\'enyi entropies in a pair SYK
models coupled by two-body terms can thermalize, if quenched from a state with
sufficiently high effective temperature, and hence exhibit state-dependent
thermalization. In contrast, SYK models coupled by single-body terms appear to
always thermalize. We provide evidence that the subthermal behavior in the
former system is likely a large-$N$ artifact by repeating the quench for finite
$N$ and finding that the saturation value of the R\'enyi entropy extrapolates
to the expected thermal value in the $N \to \infty$ limit. Finally, as a finer
grained measure of thermalization, we compute the late-time spectral form
factor of the reduced density matrix after the quench. While a single SYK dot
exhibits perfect agreement with random matrix theory, both the quadratically
and quartically coupled SYK models exhibit slight deviations.

the majority of the outflowing mass is in a molecular phase, while for three

of the multi-phase outflows, we find that their driving mechanism is consistent
with energy-conserving shocks produced by the impact of the quasar jets with
the gas in the galaxy. By assessing the molecular gas mass to the dynamics of
the outflows, we estimate a molecular gas depletion time scale of a few Myr.
The gas outflow rates exceed the star formation rates, suggesting that quasar
feedback is a major mechanism of gas depletion at the present time. The
coupling efficiency between the kinetic luminosity of the outflows and the

explore such relations in the early Universe. We defined a sample of about 800
normal star-forming galaxies with photometries in the range of 0.15 < $\lambda$
< 500 microns and analysed them with different spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting methods. With the SEDs extracted, we investigated the detection

SFR < 2 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, the correlation scatter increases dramatically. We
show that selection based on the fraction of ultraviolet (UV) emission absorbed
by dust, that is, the UV extinction, greatly reduces the data dispersion.
Reproducing the sensitivity of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science

(M$_\ast$), we investigated the MIRI detection rate as a function of the
physical properties of the galaxies. Fifty percent of the objects with SFR
$\sim$ 1 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ at $z$ = 6 are detected with F770, which decreases
to 20% at $z$ = 8. For such galaxies, only 5% of the subsample will be detected
at 5$\sigma$ with F770 and F1000 at $z$ = 8, and only 10% with F770, F1000, and
F1280 at $z$ = 6. The link between dust and star formation is complex, and many
aspects remain to be fully understood. In this context, the JWST will
revolutionise the field, allowing investigation of the dust--star interplay

Roche lobe around the inner binary. Subsequently, the tertiary star can
transfer mass to the inner binary in a stable manner, or Roche lobe overflow
(RLOF) can be unstable and lead to common-envelope (CE) evolution. In the
latter case, the inner binary enters the extended envelope of the tertiary star
and spirals in towards the donor's core, potentially leading to mergers or
ejections. Although studied in detail for individual systems, a comprehensive
statistical view on the various outcomes of triple RLOF is lacking. Here, we
carry out 10^5 population synthesis simulations of tight triples,
self-consistently taking into account stellar evolution, binary interactions,
and gravitational dynamics. Also included are prescriptions for the long-term
evolution of stable triple mass transfer, and triple CE evolution. Although
simple and ignoring hydrodynamic effects, these prescriptions allow for a
qualitative statistical study. We find that triple RLOF occurs in ~0.06% of
triples, with ~64% leading to stable mass transfer, and ~36% to triple CE
evolution. Triple CE is most often (~76%) followed by one or multiple mergers
in short succession, most likely an inner binary merger of two main-sequence
stars. Other outcomes of triple CE are a binary+single system (~23%, most of
which not involving exchange interactions), and a stable triple (~1%). We also
estimate the rate of Type Ia supernovae involving white dwarf mergers following
triple RLOF, but find only a negligible contribution.

these gap-opening planets may be undergoing their last mass doublings, reaching

dispersed and the expected price is higher than the marginal cost of
production. This implies that firms retain market power even if price
information is disseminated among a very large number of consumers due to
technological progress, such as social networking websites.

high-redshift galaxies at $z\sim$2 taken from the KMOS Lensed Emission Lines
and VElocity Review (KLEVER) Survey with a comparison sample of local galaxies,
taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The KLEVER sample shows only a
mild enrichment in N/O of $+$0.1 dex when compared to local galaxies at a given
gas-phase metallicity (O/H), but shows a depletion in N/O of $-$0.36 dex when
compared at a fixed stellar mass (M$_*$). We find a strong anti-correlation in
local galaxies between N/O and SFR in the M$_*$-N/O plane, similar to the
anti-correlation between O/H and SFR found in the mass-metallicity relation
(MZR). We use this anti-correlation to construct a fundamental nitrogen
relation (FNR), analogous to the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). We
find that KLEVER galaxies are consistent with both the FMR and the FNR. This
suggests that the depletion of N/O in high-$z$ galaxies when considered at a
fixed M$_*$ is driven by the redshift-evolution of the mass-metallicity
relation in combination with a near redshift-invariant N/O-O/H relation.
Furthermore, the existence of an fundamental nitrogen relation suggests that
the mechanisms governing the fundamental metallicity relation must be probed by
not only O/H, but also N/O, suggesting pure-pristine gas inflows are not the
primary driver of the FMR, and other properties such as variations in galaxy
age and star formation efficiency must be important.

complexity of observed radio structures to their environment, in order to
understand their interplay and the reason for the plethora of radio structures
found in surveys. In this project, we explore the distortion of the radio
structure of Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type radio sources in the VLA-COSMOS Large
Project at 3 GHz, and relate it to their large-scale environment. We quantify
the distortion by using the angle formed between the jets/lobes of two-sided
FRs, namely bent angle (BA). Our sample includes 108 objects in the redshift
range 0.08 $< z <$ 3, which we cross-correlate to a wide range of large-scale
environments (X-ray galaxy groups, density fields, and cosmic web probes) in
the COSMOS field. The median BA of FRs in COSMOS at $z_{\rm med} \sim$ 0.9 is
167.5$^{+11.5}_{-37.5}$ degrees. We do not find significant correlations
between BA and large-scale environments within COSMOS, covering scales from a
few kpc to several hundred Mpc, nor between BA and host properties. Finally, we
compare our observational data to magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) adaptive-mesh
simulations ENZO-MHD of two FR sources at $z$ = 0.5 and at $z$ = 1. Although
the scatter in BA of the observed data is large, we see an agreement between
observations and simulations in the bent angles of FRs, following a mild
redshift evolution with BA. We conclude that the dominant mechanism affecting
the radio structures of FRs could be the evolution of the ambient medium, where
higher densities and longer depths at lower redshifts allow for more space for
jet interactions.

substitute H2S ones. The structural behavior of these compounds is very similar

into Pnma structure at 132-159 GPa and then transforms into a common Im-3m H3S

$f(x+1)=g(x)f(x)$ has been seriously studied from first half of the twentieth
century till now. Regarding unique solutions of the equation the asymptotic
condition $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to \infty}}\frac{g(x+w)}{g(x)}=1$, for each
$w>0$, is considered in many serial papers including R. Webster's article
(1997). Motivated by the topic of limit summability of real functions
(introduced by the author in 2001), we first show that the asymptotic condition
in the Webster's paper can be reduced to the convergence of the sequence
$\frac{g(n+1)}{g(n)}$ to $1$, and then by removing the initial condition
$f(1)=1$ we generalize it. On the other hand, Rassias and Trif proved that if
$g$ satisfies another appropriate asymptotic condition, then the equation
admits at most one solution $f$, which is eventually $\log$-convex of the
second order. We also sow that without changing the asymptotic condition for
this case, a uniqueness theorem similar to the Webster's result is also valid
for eventually $\log$-convex solutions $f$ of the second order. This result
implies a new uniqueness theorem for the gamma function which states the
$\log$-convexity condition in the Bohr-Mollerup Theorem can be replaced by
$\log$-concavity of order two. At last, some important questions about them
will be asked.

appearance information and site-invariant anatomical information from images
acquired at multiple sites and then employs the disentangled information to
generate the image of each subject for any target site. We demonstrate with
more than 6,000 multi-site T1- and T2-weighted images that our method is
remarkably effective in generating images with realistic site-specific

well-known semi-classical phenomenon of self-induced transparency (SIT).
Separately, in the regime where both light and atoms are fully treated quantum
mechanically, quantum few-photon bound states are known to be a ubiquitous
phenomenon that arises in different systems such as atoms coupled to chiral or
bidirectional waveguides, and in Rydberg atomic media. In the specific case of
two-level atoms coupled to a chiral waveguide, a recent analysis based on Bethe
ansatz has established that SIT emerges from the quantum realm as a
superposition of quantum many-photon bound states. Beyond this case, however,
the nature of any connection between the full quantum many-body regime and
semi-classical behavior has not been established. Here, we employ a general
spin-model formulation of quantum atom-light interfaces to numerically
investigate this problem, taking advantage of the fact that this approach
readily allows for powerful many-body simulations based on matrix product
states (MPS). We first analytically derive the two-photon bound state
dispersion relation for a variety of atom-light interfaces, and then proceed to
numerically investigate the multi-excitation bound states dynamics.
Interestingly, for all the specific systems studied, we find that the
large-photon number limit always coincides with the soliton phenomenon of
self-induced transparency or immediate generalizations thereof.

thin liquid layer. This process is well-understood for homogeneous fluids, but
heterogeneities such as particles dispersed in the liquid lead to more complex
situations. Indeed, particles introduce a new length scale, their size, in
addition to the thickness of the coating film. Recent studies have shown that
at first order, the thickness of the coating film for monodisperse particles
can be captured by an effective capillary number based on the viscosity of the
suspension, providing that the film is thicker than the particle diameter.
However, suspensions involved in most practical applications are polydisperse,
characterized by a wide range of particle sizes, introducing additional length
scales. In this study, we investigate the dip coating of suspensions having a
bimodal size distribution of particles. We show that the effective viscosity
approach is still valid in the regime where the coating film is thicker than
the diameter of the largest particles, although bidisperse suspensions are less
viscous than monodisperse suspensions of the same solid fraction. We also
characterize the intermediate regime that consists of a heterogeneous coating
layer and where the composition of the film is different from the composition
of the bath. A model to predict the probability of entraining the particles in
the liquid film depending on their sizes is proposed and captures our
measurements. In this regime, corresponding to a specific range of withdrawal
velocities, capillarity filters the large particles out of the film.

that maximises (or minimises) a quadratic objective function. Optimisation
problems on the Stiefel manifold occur for example in spectral relaxations of
various combinatorial problems, such as graph matching, clustering, or
permutation synchronisation. Although sparsity is a desirable property in such
settings, it is mostly neglected in spectral formulations since existing
solvers, e.g. based on eigenvalue decomposition, are unable to account for
sparsity while at the same time maintaining global optimality guarantees. We
fill this gap and propose a simple yet effective sparsity-promoting
modification of the Orthogonal Iteration algorithm for finding the dominant
eigenspace of a matrix. By doing so, we can guarantee that our method finds a
Stiefel matrix that is globally optimal with respect to the quadratic objective
function, while in addition being sparse. As a motivating application we
consider the task of permutation synchronisation, which can be understood as a
constrained clustering problem that has particular relevance for matching
multiple images or 3D shapes in computer vision, computer graphics, and beyond.

actuator saturation on the metabolic cost, muscle activation, and joint
reaction forces of subjects walking under different loading conditions. For the
multi-criteria comparison of exoskeletons, we introduce a Pareto optimization
approach to simultaneously optimize the exoskeleton power consumption and the
human metabolic rate reduction during walking, under different loading
conditions. We further superpose the effects of device inertia and electrical
regeneration on the metabolic rate and power consumption, respectively. Our
results explain the effects of heavy loads on the optimal assistance profiles
of the exoskeletons and provide guidelines on choosing optimal device
configurations under actuator torque limitations, device inertia, and
regeneration effects. The multi-criteria comparison of devices indicates that
despite the similar assistance levels of both devices, mono-articular
exoskeletons show better performance on reducing the peak reaction forces,
while the power consumption of bi-articular devices is less sensitive to the

lower detrimental effects on the metabolic cost of subjects and does not affect

generate trajectories for self-driving vehicles to follow. A common motion
planning approach is to generate trajectories within semantic safe corridors.
The trajectories are generated by optimizing parametric curves (e.g. Bezier
curves) according to an objective function. To guarantee safety, the curves are
required to satisfy the convex hull property, and be contained within the
safety corridors. The convex hull property however does not necessary hold for
time-dependent corridors, and depends on the shape of corridors. The existing
approaches only support simple shape corridors, which is restrictive in
real-world, complex scenarios. In this paper, we provide a sufficient condition
for general convex, spatio-temporal corridors with theoretical proof of
guaranteed convex hull property. The theorem allows for using more complicated
shapes to generate spatio-temporal corridors and minimizing the uncovered
search space to $O(\frac{1}{n^2})$ compared to $O(1)$ of trapezoidal corridors,

called as the 2020 BlackLivesMatter movement. Eventually, many user accounts
are deleted by their owners or suspended due to violating the rules of social
media platforms. In this study, we analyze what happened in Twitter before and
after the event triggers with respect to deleted and suspended users. We create
a novel dataset that includes approximately 500k users sharing 20m tweets, half
of whom actively participated in the 2020 BlackLivesMatter discussion, but some
of them were deleted or suspended later. We particularly examine the factors
for undesirable behavior in terms of spamming, negative language, hate speech,
and misinformation spread. We find that the users who participated to the 2020
BlackLivesMatter discussion have more negative and undesirable tweets, compared
to the users who did not. Furthermore, the number of new accounts in Twitter
increased significantly after the trigger event occurred, yet new users are
more oriented to have undesirable tweets, compared to old ones.

significant challenge to time-series analysis. In the literature, the fusion of
multi-source time-series has been achieved either by using ensemble learning
models which ignore temporal patterns and correlation within features or by
defining a fixed-size window to select specific parts of the data sets. On the
other hand, many studies have shown major improvement to handle the
irregularity of time-series, yet none of these studies has been applied to
multi-source data. In this work, we design a novel architecture, PIETS, to
model heterogeneous time-series. PIETS has the following characteristics: (1)
irregularity encoders for multi-source samples that can leverage all available
information and accelerate the convergence of the model; (2) parallelised
neural networks to enable flexibility and avoid information overwhelming; and
(3) attention mechanism that highlights different information and gives high
importance to the most related data. Through extensive experiments on
real-world data sets related to COVID-19, we show that the proposed
architecture is able to effectively model heterogeneous temporal data and
outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in the prediction task.

what extent their ranks produce inequality and inequity when applied to
directed social networks. To this end, we propose a directed network model with
preferential attachment and homophily (DPAH) and demonstrate the influence of
network structure on the rank distributions of these algorithms. Our main
findings suggest that (i) inequality is positively correlated with inequity,
(ii) inequality is driven by the interplay between preferential attachment,
homophily, node activity and edge density, and (iii) inequity is driven by the
interplay between homophily and minority size. In particular, these two
algorithms reduce, replicate and amplify the representation of minorities in
top ranks when majorities are homophilic, neutral and heterophilic,
respectively. Moreover, when this representation is reduced, minorities may
improve their visibility in the rank by connecting strategically in the
network. For instance, by increasing their out-degree or homophily when
majorities are also homophilic. These findings shed light on the social and
algorithmic mechanisms that hinder equality and equity in network-based ranking

beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) have been proposed as novel RIS architectures
whose scattering matrix is not limited to being diagonal. However, BDRISs have
been studied assuming continuous-value scattering matrices, which are hard to
implement in practice. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing two
solutions to realize discrete-value group and fully connected RISs. First, we
propose scalar-discrete RISs, in which each entry of the RIS impedance matrix
is independently discretized. Second, we propose vector-discrete RISs, where
the entries in each group of the RIS impedance matrix are jointly discretized.
In both solutions, the codebook is designed offline such as to minimize the
distortion caused in the RIS impedance matrix by the discretization operation.
Numerical results show that vector-discrete RISs achieve higher performance
than scalar discrete RISs at the cost of increased optimization complexity.
Furthermore, fewer resolution bits per impedance are necessary to achieve the
performance upper bound as the group size of the group connected architecture
increases. In particular, only a single resolution bit is sufficient in fully
connected RISs to approximately achieve the performance upper bound.

thermal sensing due to their high mechanical quality factor and the high
temperature sensitivity of their resonance frequency. As such, gaining an
understanding of heat transport in SiN resonators as well as their sensing
noise limitations is of interest, both of which are goals of the present work.
We first present new experimental results on radiative heat transport in SiN
membrane, which we use for benchmarking two recently proposed theoretical
models. We measure the characteristic thermal response time of square SiN
membranes with a thickness of 90 $\pm$ 1.7 nm and side lengths from 1.5 to 12
mm. A clear transition between radiation and conduction dominated heat
transport is measured, in close correspondence with theory. In the second
portion of this work, we use our experimentally validated heat transport model
to provide a closed-form expression for thermal fluctuation-induced frequency
noise in SiN membrane resonators. We find that, for large area SiN membranes,
thermal fluctuations can be greater than thermomechanical contributions to
frequency noise. For the specific case of thermal radiation sensing
applications, we also derive the noise equivalent power resulting from thermal
fluctuation-induced frequency noise, and we show in which conditions it reduces
to the classical detectivity limit of thermal radiation sensors. Our work
therefore provides a path towards achieving thermal radiation sensors operating
at the never attained fundamental detectivity limit of bolometric sensing. We
also identify questions that remain when attempting to push the limits of
radiation sensing, in particular, the effect of thermal fluctuation noise in
closed-loop frequency tracking schemes remains to be clarified.

properly integrate data based methods with existing knowledge or models. In
this paper, based on the time series data, we propose two different directions
to integrate the two, a decomposition-based method and a method exploiting the
statistic extraction of data features. The first one decomposes the data into
linear stable, nonlinear stable and unstable parts, where suitable statistical

free products of finite groups: we determine bounds for the degree and height
of the minimal polynomial of the generating function, and determine the minimal
polynomial explicitly for some families of free products. Using these results
we are able to prove that a gap theorem holds: if $S$ is a finite symmetric
generating set for a group $G$ and if $a_n$ denotes the number of words of

of complex relationships over a variety of probability distributions. However,
while tree-structured PGMs always result in efficient and exact solutions,
inference on graph (or loopy) structured PGMs is not guaranteed to discover the
optimal solutions. It is in principle possible to convert loopy PGMs to an
equivalent tree structure, but this is usually impractical for interesting
problems due to exponential blow-up. To address this, we developed the
purge-and-merge algorithm. This algorithm iteratively nudges a malleable graph
structure towards a tree structure by selectively merging factors. The merging
process is designed to avoid exponential blow-up by way of sparse structures
from which redundancy is purged as the algorithm progresses. We set up tasks to
test the algorithm on constraint-satisfaction puzzles such as Sudoku,
Fill-a-pix, and Kakuro, and it outperformed other PGM-based approaches reported
in the literature. While the tasks we set focussed on the binary logic of CSP,
we believe the purge-and-merge algorithm could be extended to general PGM
inference.

collection of agents to learn complex temporally extended tasks. The
difficulties lie in computational complexity and how to learn the high-level
ideas behind reward functions. We study the graph-based Markov Decision Process
(MDP) where the dynamics of neighboring agents are coupled. We use a reward
machine (RM) to encode each agent's task and expose reward function internal
structures. RM has the capacity to describe high-level knowledge and encode
non-Markovian reward functions. We propose a decentralized learning algorithm
to tackle computational complexity, called decentralized graph-based
reinforcement learning using reward machines (DGRM), that equips each agent
with a localized policy, allowing agents to make decisions independently, based
on the information available to the agents. DGRM uses the actor-critic
structure, and we introduce the tabular Q-function for discrete state problems.
We show that the dependency of Q-function on other agents decreases
exponentially as the distance between them increases. Furthermore, the
complexity of DGRM is related to the local information size of the largest
$\kappa$-hop neighborhood, and DGRM can find an
$O(\rho^{\kappa+1})$-approximation of a stationary point of the objective
function. To further improve efficiency, we also propose the deep DGRM
algorithm, using deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function and policy
function to solve large-scale or continuous state problems. The effectiveness
of the proposed DGRM algorithm is evaluated by two case studies, UAV package
delivery and COVID-19 pandemic mitigation. Experimental results show that local
information is sufficient for DGRM and agents can accomplish complex tasks with
the help of RM. DGRM improves the global accumulated reward by 119% compared to
the baseline in the case of COVID-19 pandemic mitigation.

outliers also exist for more typical GRBs? Within the context of a systematic
analysis of photometric signatures of GRB-associated SNe, we found an anomalous
bump in the late-time transient following GRB 140506A. We hereby aim to show
this bump is significantly more luminous and blue than usual SNe following
GRBs. We compile all available data from the literature, and add a full
analysis of the Swift UVOT data, which allows us to trace the light curve from
the first minutes all the way to the host galaxy, as well as construct a broad
SED of the afterglow that extends the previous SED analysis based on
ground-based spectroscopy. We find robust evidence for a late-time bump/plateau
following the afterglow which shows evidence for a strong colour change, with
the spectral slope becoming flatter in the blue region of the spectrum. This
bump can be interpreted as a luminous SN bump which is spectrally dissimilar to
typical GRB-SNe. Correcting it for the large line-of-sight extinction results
in extreme values which make the SN associated with GRB 140506A the most
luminous detected so far. Even so, it would be in agreement with a
luminosity-duration relation of GRB-SNe. While not supported by spectroscopic
evidence, it is likely the blue bump following GRB 140506A is the signature of
a SN which is spectrally dissimilar to classical GRB-SNe and more similar to SN
2011kl -- while being associated with an average GRB, indicating the GRB-SN
population is more diverse than thought so far, and can reach luminosities
comparable to those of superluminous SNe.

The task of temporal activity detection in untrimmed videos aims to localize
the temporal boundary of actions and classify the action categories. Temporal

provides an extensive overview of deep learning-based algorithms to tackle
temporal action detection in untrimmed videos with different supervision levels

spatio-temporal action detection where actions are localized in both temporal

these entities are often sub-atomic in nature, aberration corrected
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the ideal characterisation technique.
Software to quantify and visualise the slight shifts in atomic placement within
unit cells is of paramount importance due to the now routine acquisition of
images at such resolution. In the previous ~decade since the commercialisation
of aberration corrected TEM, many research groups have written their own code
to visualise these polar entities. More recently, open access Python packages
have been developed for the purpose of TEM atomic position quantification.
Building on these packages, we introduce the TEMUL Toolkit: a Python package
for analysis and visualisation of atomic resolution images. Here, we focus
specifically on the TopoTEM module of the toolkit where we show an easy to
follow, streamlined version of calculating the atomic displacements relative to
the surrounding lattice and thus polarisation plotting. We hope this toolkit
will benefit the rapidly expanding field of topology based nano-electronic and
quantum materials research, and we invite the electron microscopy community to
contribute to this open access project.

present a rigorous answer to this question by designing novel sequential

confidence intervals that can be continuously monitored and are valid at
arbitrary data-dependent stopping times (""anytime-valid""). The widths of our
CSs are adaptive to the underlying variance of the score differences.
Underlying their construction is a game-theoretic statistical framework, in
which we further identify e-processes and p-processes for sequentially testing
a weak null hypothesis -- whether one forecaster outperforms another on average
(rather than always). Our methods do not make distributional assumptions on the
forecasts or outcomes; our main theorems apply to any bounded scores, and we
later provide alternative methods for unbounded scores. We empirically validate
our approaches by comparing real-world baseball and weather forecasters.

three case studies highlighting the current limitations of, and future research

new algorithm, and a control group, which uses the existing algorithm. However,
because networks are congested, both treatment and control traffic compete
against each other for resources in a way that biases the outcome of these
tests. This bias can have a surprisingly large effect; for example, in lab A/B
tests with two widely used congestion control algorithms, the treatment
appeared to deliver 150% higher throughput when used by a few flows, and 75%
lower throughput when used by most flows-despite the fact that the two
algorithms have identical throughput when used by all traffic.
  Beyond the lab, we show that A/B tests can also be biased at scale. In an

the direction of change of some metrics, miss changes in other metrics, and
overestimate the size of effects. We propose alternative experiment designs,

large angular scales to compare their consistency with two scenarios: the
standard inflationary quantum picture, and a distribution constrained to have a
universal variance of primordial curvature perturbations on great circles. The
latter symmetry is not a property of standard quantum inflation, but may be a
symmetry of holographic models with causal quantum coherence on null surfaces.
Since the variation of great-circle variance is dominated by the largest
angular scale modes, in the latter case the amplitude and direction of the
unobserved intrinsic dipole (that is, the $\ell=1$ harmonics) can be estimated
from measured $\ell = 2, 3$ harmonics by minimizing the variance of
great-circle variances including only $\ell =1, 2, 3$ modes. It is found that
including the estimated intrinsic dipole leads to a nearly-null angular
correlation function over a wide range of angles, in agreement with a null
anti-hemispherical symmetry independently motivated by holographic causal
arguments, but highly anomalous in standard cosmology. Simulations are used
here to show that simultaneously imposing the constraints of universal
great-circle variance and the vanishing of the angular correlation function
over a wide range of angles tends to require patterns that are unusual in the
standard picture, such as anomalously high sectorality of the $\ell = 3$
components, and a close alignment of principal axes of $\ell=2$ and $\ell = 3$
components, that have been previously noted on the actual sky. The precision of
these results appears to be primarily limited by errors introduced by models of

materials, and particularly bio-tissues. From multi-step relaxation experiments
of distinct anatomical locations of porcine urinary bladder, we identify an
anomalous relaxation character, with two power-law-like behaviors for
short/long long times, and nonlinearity for strains greater than 25%. The first
component of our framework is an existence study, to determine admissible
fractional viscoelastic models that qualitatively describe the linear
relaxation behavior. After the linear viscoelastic model is selected, the
second stage adds large-strain effects to the framework through a fractional
quasi-linear viscoelastic approach, given by a multiplicative kernel
decomposition of the selected relaxation function and a nonlinear elastic
response for the bio-tissue of interest. From single-relaxation data of the
urinary bladder, a fractional Maxwell model captures both short/long-term
behaviors with two fractional orders, being the most suitable model for small
strains at the first stage. For the second stage, multi-step relaxation data
under large strains were employed to calibrate a four-parameter fractional
quasi-linear viscoelastic model, that combines a Scott-Blair relaxation
function and an exponential instantaneous stress response, to describe the
elastin/collagen phases of bladder rheology. Our obtained results demonstrate
that the employed fractional quasi-linear model, with a single fractional order
in the range $\alpha = 0.25 - 0.30$, is suitable for the porcine urinary
bladder, producing errors below 2% without need for recalibration over
subsequent applied strains. We conclude that fractional models are attractive
tools to capture the bladder tissue behavior under small-to-large strains and
multiple time scales, therefore being potential alternatives to describe
multiple stages of bladder functionality.

gravitationally radiating systems. The approach is manifestly
Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) invariant, and there are no supertranslation
ambiguities. The resulting definitions of center of mass and spin are
appealing: unphysical contributions from bad cuts are canceled off from the
center of mass, and the spin appears formally as a displacement of the center
of mass into the complex. For transitions between asymptotically Minkowskian
regimes (non-radiative regimes with purely electric Bondi shear), when there is
no supertranslation offset (equivalently, radation memory) between the regimes
the results are in agreement with those deducible from other approaches.
However, when there is an offset, the results are different. The
twistor-derived change-of-origin formula is closely parallel to the
special-relativistic one, with an algebraic cross-product between the
energy-momentum and a direction-dependent translation derived from the
supertranslation. (No supermomenta appear.) There is also a ""longitudinal""
contribution to the emitted angular momentum (one sensitive to the total
energy-momentum and not just the emitted energy-momentum), and terms which are
both linear and cubic in the gravitational radiation (whereas BMS-based
definitions give purely quadratic contributions). The first-order terms mean
that the supertranslation offsets can contribute to the exchange of angular
momentum with gravitational radiation, even in weak-field limits. This is
illustrated with a simple almost-special-relativistic model.

($\Lambda$CDM) simulations and the constant-density inner regions of observed

demonstrate that the \texttt{SMUGGLE} galaxy formation model implemented in the
\textsc{Arepo} moving mesh code forms constant-density cores in idealized dwarf
galaxies of $M_\star \approx 8 \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ with initially cuspy
dark matter halos of $M_{200} \approx 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. Identical initial
conditions run with the Springel and Hernquist (2003; SH03) feedback model
preserve cuspiness. Literature on the subject has pointed to the low density
threshold for star formation, $\rho_\text{th}$, in SH03-like models as an
obstacle to baryon-induced core formation. Using a \texttt{SMUGGLE} run with
equal $\rho_\text{th}$ to SH03, we demonstrate that core formation can proceed
at low density thresholds, indicating that $\rho_\text{th}$ is insufficient on
its own to determine whether a galaxy develops a core. We suggest that the
ability to resolve a multiphase interstellar medium at sufficiently high
densities is a more reliable indicator of core formation than any individual
model parameter. In \texttt{SMUGGLE}, core formation is accompanied by large
degrees of non-circular motion, with gas rotational velocity profiles that
consistently fall below the circular velocity $v_\text{circ} = \sqrt{GM/R}$ out
to $\sim 2$ kpc. This may artificially mimic larger core sizes when derived
from observable quantities compared to the size measured from the dark matter
distribution ($\sim 0.5$ kpc), highlighting the need for careful modeling in
the inner regions of dwarfs to infer the true distribution of dark matter.

We illustrate that ultra-chaos is widely existed and thus has general

inherent property of an ultra-chaos so that an ultra-chaos is at a higher-level
of disorder than a normal-chaos. Thus, it is impossible in practice to
replicate experimental/numerical results of an ultra-chaos even in statistical

control. Thus, the ultra-chaos should be an insurmountable obstacle of
reproducibility and replicability. Similar to G\""{o}del's incompleteness

of our traditional scientific paradigm based on reproducible experiments, which
can be traced back to Galileo. The ultra-chaos opens a new door and possibility

the statistical significance, reproducibility crisis, and so on.

Class 0 protostellar source L483 with ALMA and have performed principal
component analysis (PCA) for their cube data (PCA-3D) to characterize their
distributions and velocity structures in the vicinity of the protostar. The sum
of the contributions of the first three components is 63.1 %. Most
oxygen-bearing complex-organic-molecule lines have a large correlation with the
first principal component (PC1), representing the overall structure of the
disk/envelope system around the protostar. Contrary, the C18O and SiO emissions
show small and negative correlations with PC1. The NH2CHO lines stand out
conspicuously at the second principal component (PC2), revealing more compact
distribution. The HNCO lines and the high excitation line of CH3OH have a
similar trend for PC2 to NH2CHO. On the other hand, C18O is well correlated
with the third principal component (PC3). Thus, PCA-3D enables us to elucidate
the similarities and the differences of the distributions and the velocity
structures among molecular lines simultaneously, so that the chemical
differentiation between the oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules and the
nitrogen-bearing ones is revealed in this source. We have also conducted PCA
for the moment 0 maps (PCA-2D) and that for the spectral line profiles
(PCA-1D). While they can extract part of characteristics of the molecular-line

which complicates comparison of results for different prior families. Further,
there are some notable gaps in the software - for example, implementations for
simple normal and point-normal priors are absent. Motivated by these issues, we
developed the R package ebnm, which provides a unified interface for
efficiently solving the EBNM problem using a wide variety of prior families,
both parametric and non-parametric. Where practical we leverage core fitting
procedures from existing packages, writing wrappers to create a unified

  introduction to applied signals-and-systems theory for engineers","Added Morrison and Brookner refs",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Kalman filter computes the optimal variable-gain using prior knowledge of
the initial state and random (process and measurement) noise distributions,
which are assumed to be Gaussian with known variance. However, when these
distributions are unknown, the Kalman filter is not necessarily optimal and
other simpler state-estimators, such as fixed-gain ({\alpha}, {\alpha}-\b{eta}
or {\alpha}-\b{eta}-{\gamma} etc.) filters may be sufficient. When such filters
are used as low-complexity state-estimators in embedded tracking systems, the
fixed gain parameters are usually set equal to the steady-state gains of the
corresponding Kalman filter. An alternative procedure, that does not rely prior
distributions, based on Luenberger observers, is presented here. It is
suggested that the arbitrary placement of closed-loop state-observer poles is a
simple and intuitive way of tuning the transient and steady-state response of a
fixed-gain tracking filter when prior distributions are unknown. All poles are
placed inside the unit circle on the positive real axis of the complex z-plane
at p for a well damped response and a configurable bandwidth. Transient bias
errors, e.g. due to target manoeuvres or process modelling errors, decrease as
p=0 is approached for a wider bandwidth. Steady-state random errors, e.g. due
to sensor noise, decrease as p=1 is approached for a narrower bandwidth. Thus
the p parameter (with 0<p<1) may be interpreted as a dimensionless smoothing
factor. This tutorial-style report examines state-observer design by pole
placement, which is a standard procedure for feedback controls but unusual for
tracking filters, due to the success and popularity of the Kalman filter. As
Bayesian trackers are designed via statistical modelling, not by pole-zero
placement in the complex plane, the underlying principles of linear
time-invariant signals and systems are also reviewed.

responses from the pre-built index has gained increasing attention from
researchers. For this task, the adoption of pre-trained language models (such
as BERT) has led to remarkable progress in a number of benchmarks. There exist
two common approaches, including cross-encoders which perform full attention
over the inputs, and bi-encoders that encode the context and response
separately. The former gives considerable improvements in accuracy but is often
inapplicable in practice for large-scale retrieval given the cost of the full
attention required for each sample at test time. The latter is efficient for
billions of indexes but suffers from sub-optimal performance. In this work, we
propose to combine the best of both worlds to build a retrieval system.
Specifically, we employ a fast bi-encoder to replace the traditional
feature-based pre-retrieval model (such as BM25) and set the response
re-ranking model as a more complicated architecture (such as cross-encoder). To
further improve the effectiveness of our framework, we train the pre-retrieval
model and the re-ranking model at the same time via mutual learning, which
enables two models to learn from each other throughout the training process. We
conduct experiments on two benchmarks and evaluation results demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed framework.

separates into layered asters that coexist with the background turbulent fluid.
Contracted onion-like asters have a radially extending microtubule-rich cortex
that envelops alternating layers of microtubules and F-actin. The
self-regulating layered organization survives aster merging events, which are
reminiscent of droplet coalescence, and suggest the presence of effective

work. What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work
they do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid
invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly
wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or
managing payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd
workers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them
economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to
be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In
this paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd
work. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon
Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If
we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly
wage was $3.76. But, we estimated that crowd workers in our study spent 33% of
their time daily on invisible labor, dropping their median hourly wage to
$2.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers
depending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor
category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved
around workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming
invisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly
watched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched
for labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor in crowdsourcing
becomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of
the continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing.

planning under motion and sensing uncertainties. The algorithm interleaves
between batch sampling, building a graph of nominal trajectories in the state

searching over the graph, BBT finds sophisticated plans that will visit (and
revisit) information-rich regions to reduce uncertainty. One of the key
benefits of this algorithm is the modified interplay between exploration and
exploitation. Instead of an exhaustive search (exploitation) after one
exploration step, the proposed algorithm uses batch samples to explore the
state space and, in addition, does not require exhaustive search before the
next iteration of batch sampling, which adds flexibility.The algorithm finds
motion plans that converge to the optimal one as more samples are added to the

investigation confirms that BBT finds non-trivial motion plans and is faster

early 2020. Reliable forecasting is critical to diminish the impact of this
disease. To date, a large number of different forecasting models have been
proposed, mainly including statistical models, compartmental models, and deep
learning models. However, due to various uncertain factors across different
regions such as economics and government policy, no forecasting model appears
to be the best for all scenarios. In this paper, we perform quantitative
analysis of COVID-19 forecasting of confirmed cases and deaths across different
regions in the United States with different forecasting horizons, and evaluate
the relative impacts of the following three dimensions on the predictive
performance (improvement and variation) through different evaluation metrics:
model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and the length of time series required
for training. We find that if a dimension brings about higher performance
gains, if not well-tuned, it may also lead to harsher performance penalties.
Furthermore, model selection is the dominant factor in determining the
predictive performance. It is responsible for both the largest improvement and
the largest variation in performance in all prediction tasks across different
regions. While practitioners may perform more complicated time series analysis
in practice, they should be able to achieve reasonable results if they have
adequate insight into key decisions like model selection.

The critical case ${\mathbf c}_{\mathrm M} = 1$ corresponds to $\gamma=2$ and
the supercritical case ${\mathbf c}_{\mathrm M} \in (1,25)$ corresponds to
$\gamma \in \mathbb C$ with $|\gamma| = 2$.
  Our metric is constructed as the limit of an approximation procedure called
Liouville first passage percolation, which was previously shown to be tight for
$\mathbf c_{\mathrm M} \in [1,25)$ by Ding and Gwynne (2020). In this paper, we
show that the subsequential limit is uniquely characterized by a natural list

parameter range $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M} \in (-\infty,25)$.
  Our argument is substantially different from the proof of the

pulsars and 46 pulsars with high energy emissions. However, we noticed that 630
young radio pulsars with spin periods of less than half a second have been not
yet observed the SNRs surrounding or nearby them, which arises a question of
that could the two types of young radio pulsars with/without SNRs hold
distinctive characteristics? Here, we employ the statistical tests on the two
groups of young radio pulsars with (52) and without (630) SNRs to reveal if
they share different origins. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and
Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (M-W-W) tests indicate that the two samples have the
different distributions with parameters of spin period ($P$), derivative of
spin period ($\dot P$), surface magnetic field strength ($B$), and energy loss
rate ($\dot E$). Meanwhile, the cumulative number ratio between the pulsars
with and without SNRs at the different spindown ages decreases significantly
after $\rm10-20\,Kyr$. So we propose that the existence of the two types of
supernovae (SNe), corresponding to their SNR lifetimes, which can be roughly
ascribed to the low-energy and high-energy SNe. Furthermore, the low-energy SNe
may be formed from the $\rm8-12\,M_{\odot}$ progenitor, e.g., possibly
experiencing the electron capture, while the main sequence stars of
$\rm12-25\,M_{\odot}$ may produce the high-energy SNe probably by the iron core
collapse.

quantifications often suffer from overgeneralization in out-of-support regions.
The unreliable conservative measures will mislead forward model-based
imaginations to undesired areas, leading to overaggressive behaviors. To
encourage more conservatism, we propose a novel model-based offline RL
framework, called Reverse Offline Model-based Imagination (ROMI). We learn a
reverse dynamics model in conjunction with a novel reverse policy, which can
generate rollouts leading to the target goal states within the offline dataset.
These reverse imaginations provide informed data augmentation for model-free
policy learning and enable conservative generalization beyond the offline
dataset. ROMI can effectively combine with off-the-shelf model-free algorithms
to enable model-based generalization with proper conservatism. Empirical
results show that our method can generate more conservative behaviors and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on offline RL benchmark tasks.

quantum computer is the large number of control signals needed to operate qubit

a quantum-dot spin-qubit architecture that integrates on-chip control
electronics, allowing for a significant reduction in the number of signal
connections at the chip boundary. By arranging the qubits in a two-dimensional
(2D) array with $\sim$12 $\mu$m pitch, we create space to implement locally
integrated sample-and-hold circuits. This allows to offset the inhomogeneities
in the potential landscape across the array and to globally share the majority
of the control signals for qubit operations. We make use of advanced circuit
modeling software to go beyond conceptual drawings of the component layout, to
assess the feasibility of the scheme through a concrete floor plan, including
estimates of footprints for quantum and classical electronics, as well as
routing of signal lines across the chip using different interconnect layers. We
make use of local demultiplexing circuits to achieve an efficient
signal-connection scaling leading to a Rent's exponent as low as $p = 0.43$.
Furthermore, we use available data from state-of-the-art spin qubit and
microelectronics technology development, as well as circuit models and
simulations, to estimate the operation frequencies and power consumption of a
million-qubit processor. This work presents a novel and complementary approach
to previously proposed architectures, focusing on a feasible scheme to
integrating quantum and classical hardware, and significantly closing the gap

structural properties of MoX$_2$ (X = S, Se, Te) monolayers doped with
substitutional Sb atoms, with a central focus on the Sb(Mo) substitution. In
MoS$_2$, we observe that this substitution is energetically favored under S
rich conditions, where the S$_2$ gaseous phase is likely to be present. This
result is compatible with a recent experimental observation in Sb-doped MoS$_2$
nanosheets grown by CVD. A similar behavior is found in MoSe$_2$, but in
MoTe$_2$ the Sb(Mo) substitution is less likely to occur due to the possible
absence of gaseous Te phases in experimental setups. In all cases, several
impurity-induced states are found inside the band gap, with energies that span
the entire gap. The Fermi energy is pinned a few tenths of eV above the top of
the valence band, suggesting a predominant $p$-type behavior. The orbital
nature of these states is investigated with projected and local density of
states calculations, which reveal similarities to defect states induced by
single Mo vacancies as well as their rehybridization with the $5s$ orbital from
Sb. Additionally, we find that the band gap of the doped systems is increased
in comparison with the pristine materials, in contrast with a previous
calculation in Sb-doped MoS$_2$ that predicts a gap reduction with a different
assignment of valence band and impurity levels. We discuss the similarities,
discrepancies, and the limitations of both calculations. We also speculate
possible reasons for the experimentally observed redshifts of the A and B
excitons in the presence of the Sb dopants in MoS$_2$. We hope that these
results spark future investigations on other aspects of the problem,

this study, we theoretically investigate a physical scheme to avoid detrimental

theory started to reveal its limitations in the modern era of machine
intelligence, consisting of the synergy between IoT and AI. By broadening the
scope of the classic framework, in this article we present a view of semantic

We address three communication modalities, human-to-human (H2H),
human-to-machine (H2M), and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. The latter
two, the main theme of the article, represent the paradigm shift in
communication and computing. H2M SemCom refers to semantic techniques for
conveying meanings understandable by both humans and machines so that they can
interact. M2M SemCom refers to effectiveness techniques for efficiently
connecting machines such that they can effectively execute a specific

introduces SemCom principles including encoding, system architecture, and
layer-coupling and end-to-end design approaches. The second part focuses on
specific techniques for application areas of H2M (human and AI symbiosis,
recommendation, etc.) and M2M SemCom (distributed learning, split inference,
etc.) Finally, we discuss the knowledge graphs approach for designing SemCom

preserving the neighborhood structure of data as much as possible. One of the
most established schemes for unsupervised hashing is to reduce the
dimensionality of data and then find a rigid (neighbourhood-preserving)
transformation that reduces the quantization error. Although employing rigid
transformations is effective, we may not reduce quantization loss to the
ultimate limits. As well, reducing dimensionality and quantization loss in two
separate steps seems to be sub-optimal. Motivated by these shortcomings, we
propose to employ both rigid and non-rigid transformations to reduce
quantization error and dimensionality simultaneously. We relax the
orthogonality constraint on the projection in a PCA-formulation and regularize
this by a quantization term. We show that both the non-rigid projection matrix
and rotation matrix contribute towards minimizing quantization loss but in
different ways. A scalable nested coordinate descent approach is proposed to
optimize this mixed-integer optimization problem. We evaluate the proposed
method on five public benchmark datasets providing almost half a million
images. Comparative results indicate that the proposed method mostly
outperforms state-of-art linear methods and competes with end-to-end deep

applications is the quantum adder. A variety of different implementations exist
with idiosyncratic pros and cons. One of these, the Draper quantum Fourier
adder, offers the lowest qubit count of any adder, but requires a substantial
number of gates as well as extremely fine rotations. In this work, we present a
modification of the Draper adder which eliminates small-angle rotations to
highly coarse levels, matched with some strategic corrections. This reduces
hardware requirements without sacrificing the qubit saving. We show that the
inherited loss of fidelity is directly given by the rate of carry and borrow
bits in the computation. We derive formulae to predict this, complemented by
complete gate-level matrix product state simulations of the circuit. Moreover,
we analytically describe the effects of possible stochastic control error. We
present an in-depth analysis of this approach in the context of Shor's
algorithm, focusing on the factoring of RSA-2048. Surprisingly, we find that
each of the $7\times 10^7$ quantum Fourier transforms may be truncated down to
$\pi/64$, with additive rotations left only slightly finer. This result is much
more efficient than previously realised. We quantify savings both in terms of
logical resources and raw magic states, demonstrating that phase adders can be
competitive with Toffoli-based constructions.

tracking errors can be arbitrarily kept small by increasing the gain. The NN
weight errors are basically bounded in terms of input weight and hidden weight.

the target and impactor, somewhat modified through erosion, escaping at lower
relative velocity. Here we continue our study of the dynamical effects of such
collisions. We compare the dynamical fates of intact runners that start from
hit-and-runs with proto-Venus at 0.7 AU and proto-Earth at 1.0 AU. We follow
the orbital evolutions of the runners, including the other terrestrial planets,
Jupiter, and Saturn, in an N-body code. We find that the accretion of these
runners can take $\gtrsim$10 Myr (depending on the egress velocity of the first
collision) and can involve successive collisions with the original target
planet or with other planets. We treat successive collisions that the runner
experiences using surrogate models from machine learning, as in previous work,

asymmetries in the capture, loss, and interchange of runners in the growth of
Venus and Earth. Hit-and-run is a more probable outcome at proto-Venus, being
smaller and faster orbiting than proto-Earth. But Venus acts as a sink,
eventually accreting most of its runners, assuming typical events, whereas
proto-Earth loses about half, many of those continuing to Venus. This leads to
a disparity in the style of late-stage accretion that could have led to

that O, Ti, Cr, radiogenic W, and other elements are indistinguishable in Earth

  The classical theory of Sz.-Nagy and Foias about the characteristic function
is extended in this note to a commuting tuple $\bfT$ of bounded operators
satisfying the natural positivity condition of $1/k$-contractivity for an
irreducible unitarily invariant complete Nevanlinna-Pick kernel. The
characteristic function is a multiplier from $H_k \otimes \cE$ to $H_k \otimes

$\cE$ and $\cF$ depending on $\bfT$. There is a converse, which roughly says
that if a kernel $k$ {\em admits} a characteristic function, then it has to be
an irreducible unitarily invariant complete Nevanlinna-Pick kernel. The
characterization explains, among other things, why in the literature an
analogue of the characteristic function for a Bergman contraction
($1/k$-contraction where $k$ is the Bergman kernel), when viewed as a
multiplier between two vector valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces,
requires a different (vector valued) reproducing kernel Hilbert space as the

Existing approaches to address the safety verification problems under

safety constraints, e.g., Gaussian uncertainties and linear constraints, or
rely on sampling based methods. In this paper, we provide a fast convex
algorithm to efficiently evaluate the probabilistic nonlinear safety

planning horizons in real-time, without the need for uncertainty samples and
time discretization. The provided approach verifies the safety of the given
state trajectory and its neighborhood (tube) to account for the execution
uncertainties and risk. In the provided approach, we first use the moments of
the probability distributions of the uncertainties to transform the
probabilistic safety constraints into a set of deterministic safety
constraints. We then use convex methods based on sum-of-squares polynomials to
verify the obtained deterministic safety constraints over the entire planning
time horizon without time discretization. To illustrate the performance of the
proposed method, we apply the provided method to the safety verification

if they are no longer visible. It is a crucial concept for robots to operate
autonomously in uncontrolled environments. Existing approaches learn object
permanence from low-level perception, but perform poorly on more complex
scenarios, like when objects are contained and carried by others. Knowledge
about manipulation actions performed on an object prior to its disappearance
allows us to reason about its location, e.g., that the object has been placed
in a carrier. In this paper we argue that object permanence can be improved
when the robot uses knowledge about executed actions and describe an approach
to infer hidden object states from agent actions. We show that considering
agent actions not only improves rule-based reasoning models but also purely
neural approaches, showing its general applicability. Then, we conduct
quantitative experiments on a snitch localization task using a dataset of 1,371
synthesized videos, where we compare the performance of different object
permanence models with and without action annotations. We demonstrate that
models with action annotations can significantly increase performance of both
neural and rule-based approaches. Finally, we evaluate the usability of our
approach in real-world applications by conducting qualitative experiments with
two Universal Robots (UR5 and UR16e) in both lab and industrial settings. The
robots complete benchmark tasks for a gearbox assembly and demonstrate the
object permanence capabilities with real sensor data in an industrial

have an interaction induced gapped (or pseudo gapped) ground state. Here, we
propose that, due to the electron correlation, the BGM can be induced into a
half metallic phase by applying a vertical electric field and doping. The half
metallic states in even-layer and odd-layer BGMs have totally different
behaviors, due to their different band structures. We systematically calculate
the graphene tetralayer (4L-BGM) and trilayer (3L-BGM) as the typical examples
of the even-layer and odd-layer BGMs, respectively. In 4L-BGM, we find an
interesting phenomenon of electric field induced inversion of the
spin-polarized bands. Namely, in the half metallic phase, the spin polarization
of the conducting channel and the net magnetic moment are inversed when the
applied electric field exceeds a critical value. In 3L-BGM, a remarkable
feature is that the inequivalence of the the two sublattices will intrinsically
break the degeneracy of the the spin-up and spin-down bands even in the zero
electric field case. Our results suggest that 4L-BGM should be an ideal
platform to detect the proposed half metallic phase in BGM systems.

applications in healthcare especially in the context of home care of patients
and older adults. HAR is often based on data collected from smart sensors,
particularly smart home IoT devices such as smartphones, wearables and other
body sensors. Deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used for HAR, both in
centralized and federated settings. However, these techniques have certain
limitations: RNNs cannot be easily parallelized, CNNs have the limitation of
sequence length, and both are computationally expensive. Moreover, in home
healthcare applications the centralized approach can raise serious privacy
concerns since the sensors used by a HAR classifier collect a lot of highly
personal and sensitive data about people in the home. In this paper, to address
some of such challenges facing HAR, we propose a novel lightweight (one-patch)
transformer, which can combine the advantages of RNNs and CNNs without their
major limitations, and also TransFed, a more privacy-friendly, federated
learning-based HAR classifier using our proposed lightweight transformer. We
designed a testbed to construct a new HAR dataset from five recruited human
participants, and used the new dataset to evaluate the performance of the
proposed HAR classifier in both federated and centralized settings.
Additionally, we use another public dataset to evaluate the performance of the
proposed HAR classifier in centralized setting to compare it with existing HAR
classifiers. The experimental results showed that our proposed new solution
outperformed state-of-the-art HAR classifiers based on CNNs and RNNs, whiling
being more computationally efficient.

many biases. A particularly important example is the helium-mass degeneracy,
where the uncertainties regarding the internal physics can cause a poor
determination of both the mass and surface helium content. Accordingly, an
independent helium estimate is needed to overcome this degeneracy. A promising
way to obtain such an estimate is to exploit the so-called ionisation glitch,
i.e. a deviation from the asymptotic oscillation frequency pattern caused by
the rapid structural variation in the He ionisation zones.
  Although progressively becoming more sophisticated, the glitch-based approach
faces problems inherent to its current modelling such as the need for
calibration by realistic stellar models. This requires a physical model of the
ionisation region explicitly involving the parameters of interest such as the
surface helium abundance, $Y_s$.
  Through a thermodynamic treatment of the ionisation region, an analytical
approximation for the first adiabatic exponent $\Gamma_1$ is presented.
  The induced stellar structure is found to depend on only three parameters
including the surface helium abundance $Y_s$ and the electron degeneracy
$\psi_\textrm{CZ}$ in the convective region. The model thus defined allows a
wide variety of structures to be described and, in particular, is able to
approximate a realistic model in the ionisation region. The modelling work
conducted enables us to study the structural perturbations causing the glitch.
More elaborate forms of perturbations than the ones usually assumed are found.
It is also suggested that there might be a stronger dependence of the structure
on both the electron degeneracy in the convection zone and on the position of
the ionisation region rather than on the amount of helium itself.

conditional wave theory (CWT), which was originally developed in molecular
physics (also known as exact factorisation methods). We formulate a CWT of a
classic model of collisional decoherence of a free particle with environmental
particles treated in a long-wavelength limit. In general, the CWT equation of
motion for the particle is non-linear, where the non-linearity enters via the
CWT gauge fields. For Gaussian wave packets the analytic solutions of the CWT
equations are in exact agreement with those from the density matrix formalism.
We show that CWT gauge terms that determine the dynamics of the particle's
marginal wave function are related to a Taylor series expansion of the
particle's reduced density matrix. Approximate solutions to these equations
lead to a linear-time approximation that reproduces the ensemble width in the
limits of both short and long times, in addition to reproducing the long-term
behaviour of the coherence length. With this approximation, the non-linear
equation of motion for the particle's marginal wave function can be written in
the form of the logarithmic Schr\""odinger equation. The CWT formalism may lead
to computationally efficient calculations of quantum decoherence, since it
involves working with wave-function level terms instead of evolving a density
matrix via a master equation.

significant variations of object appearance, viewpoints and backgrounds. Most
current methods align domains by either using image or instance-level feature
alignment in an adversarial fashion. This often suffers due to the presence of
unwanted background and as such lacks class-specific alignment. A common remedy
to promote class-level alignment is to use high confidence predictions on the
unlabelled domain as pseudo labels. These high confidence predictions are often
fallacious since the model is poorly calibrated under domain shift. In this
paper, we propose to leverage model predictive uncertainty to strike the right
balance between adversarial feature alignment and class-level alignment.
Specifically, we measure predictive uncertainty on class assignments and the
bounding box predictions. Model predictions with low uncertainty are used to
generate pseudo-labels for self-supervision, whereas the ones with higher
uncertainty are used to generate tiles for an adversarial feature alignment
stage. This synergy between tiling around the uncertain object regions and
generating pseudo-labels from highly certain object regions allows us to
capture both the image and instance level context during the model adaptation
stage. We perform extensive experiments covering various domain shift
scenarios. Our approach improves upon existing state-of-the-art methods with

the recent years. While most existing services take a straight-forward approach
of cloud hosting, on-path transit networks (such as ISPs) are increasingly more
interested in offering outsourced security services to end users. Recent
proposals (such as SafeBricks and mbTLS) have made it possible to outsource
sensitive security applications to untrusted, arbitrary networks, rendering
on-path security function outsourcing more promising than ever. However, to
provide on-path security function outsourcing, there is one crucial component
that is still missing -- a practical end-to-end network protocol. Thus, the
discovery and orchestration of multiple capable and willing transit networks
for user-requested security functions have only been assumed in many studies
without any practical solutions. In this work, we propose Opsec, an end-to-end
security-outsourcing protocol that fills this gap and brings us closer to the
vision of on-path security function outsourcing. Opsec automatically discovers
one or more transit ISPs between a client and a server, and requests
user-specified security functions efficiently. When designing Opsec, we
prioritize the practicality and applicability of this new end-to-end protocol
in the current Internet. Our proof-of-concept implementation of Opsec for web

clicks of a browser plug-in, to specify a series of security functions of her
choice. We show that it is possible to implement such a new end-to-end service
model in the current Internet for the majority of the web services without any
major changes to the standard protocols (e.g., TCP, TLS, HTTP) and the existing

Synchronization of the signals is not needed as we assume there is an unknown

it assumes unknown waveforms may appear. Isolation forest (IF) models acting as
binary classifiers are used for each known signal class to perform detection of
possible unknown signals. This is accomplished using the 32-length feature

detecting unknown waveforms. Results showed the classifier had 100%

of the energy is likely hidden in the non-thermal line widths of emission
lines. In order to estimate these wave energies, many previous studies have
considered the root mean squared wave amplitudes to be a factor of $\sqrt{2}$
greater than the non-thermal line widths. However, other studies have used
different factors. To investigate this problem, we consider the relation
between wave amplitudes and the non-thermal line widths within a variety of 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations.
  Methods. We consider the following 3D numerical models: Alfv\'en waves in a
uniform magnetic field, transverse waves in a complex braided magnetic field,
and two simulations of coronal heating in an arcade. We applied the forward
modelling code FoMo to generate the synthetic emission data required to analyse
the non-thermal line widths.
  Results. Determining a single value for the ratio between the non-thermal
line widths and the root mean squared wave amplitudes is not possible across
multiple simulations. It was found to depend on a variety of factors, including
line-of-sight angles, velocity magnitudes, wave interference, and exposure
time. Indeed, some of our models achieved the values claimed in recent articles
while other more complex models deviated from these ratios.
  Conclusions. To estimate wave energies, an appropriate relation between the
non-thermal line widths and root mean squared wave amplitudes is required.
However, evaluating this ratio to be a singular value, or even providing a
lower or upper bound on it, is not realistically possible given its sensitivity
to various MHD models and factors. As the ratio between wave amplitudes and
non-thermal line widths is not constant across our models, we suggest that this
widely used method for estimating wave energy is not robust.

a decoder from multiple calls of the encoding operation. This is a
probabilistic but exact protocol whose success probability is independent of
$D$. For a qubit ($d=2$) encoded in $n$ qubits, our protocol achieves an
exponential improvement over any tomography-based or unitary-embedding method,
which cannot avoid $D$-dependence. We present a quantum operation that converts
multiple parallel calls of any given isometry operation to random parallelized
unitary operations, each of dimension $d$. Applied to our setup, it universally
compresses the encoded quantum information to a $D$-independent space, while
keeping the initial quantum information intact. This compressing operation is
combined with a unitary inversion protocol to complete the isometry inversion.
We also discover a fundamental difference between our isometry inversion
protocol and the known unitary inversion protocols by analyzing isometry
complex conjugation and isometry transposition. General protocols including
indefinite causal order are searched using semidefinite programming for any
improvement in the success probability over the parallel protocols. We find a
sequential ""success-or-draw"" protocol of universal isometry inversion for $d =

parallel protocols in the number of calls of the input isometry operation for

of dark matter (DM) halo density profiles, from low-density cores to
high-density core-collapsed cusps. The possibility of the growth of high
central density in low-mass halos, accelerated if halos are subhalos of larger
systems, has intriguing consequences for small-halo searches with substructure
lensing. However, following the evolution of $\lesssim 10^8 M_\odot$ subhalos
in lens-mass systems ($\sim 10^{13}M_\odot$) is computationally expensive with
traditional N-body simulations. In this work, we develop a new hybrid
semi-analytical + N-body method to study the evolution of SIDM subhalos with
high fidelity, from core formation to core-collapse, in staged simulations. Our
method works best for small subhalos ($\lesssim 1/1000$ host mass), for which
the error caused by dynamical friction is minimal. We are able to capture the
evaporation of subhalo particles by interactions with host halo particles, an
effect that has not yet been fully explored in the context of subhalo
core-collapse. We find three main processes drive subhalo evolution: subhalo
internal heat outflow, host-subhalo evaporation, and tidal effects. The subhalo
central density grows only when the heat outflow outweighs the energy gain from
evaporation and tidal heating. Thus, evaporation delays or even disrupts
subhalo core-collapse. We map out the parameter space for subhalos to
core-collapse, finding that it is nearly impossible to drive core-collapse in
subhalos in SIDM models with constant cross sections. Any discovery of
ultra-compact dark substructures with future substructure lensing observations
favors additional degrees of freedom, such as velocity-dependence, in the cross
section.

hampered by the Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) procedure conducted in the
laboratory annually. It not only has a large gap to real-world situations
(e.g., meteorological conditions) but also is incapable of regular supervision.
Here we build a unique dataset including 103831 light-duty gasoline vehicles,
in which on-road remote sensing (ORRS) measurements are linked to the I/M
records based on the vehicle identification numbers and license plates. On this
basis, we develop an ensemble model framework that integrates three machining
learning algorithms, including neural network (NN), extreme gradient boosting
(XGBoost), and random forest (RF). We demonstrate that this ensemble model
could rapidly assess the vehicle-specific emissions (i.e., CO, HC, and NO). In
particular, the model performs quite well for the passing vehicles under normal
conditions (i.e., lower VSP (< 18 kw/t), temperature (6 ~ 32 {\deg}C), relative
humidity (< 80%), and wind speed (< 5m/s)). Together with the current emission
standard, we identify a large number of the dirty (2.33%) or clean (74.92%)

assisted by the machine-learning-based ensemble model developed here, can

priors from the known regions of the current input image to infer the content
of the corrupted regions in the same image. While such methods perform well on
images with small corrupted regions, it is challenging for these methods to
deal with images with large corrupted area due to two potential limitations: 1)
such methods tend to overfit each single training pair of images relying solely
on the intra-image prior knowledge learned from the limited known area; 2) the
inter-image prior knowledge about the general distribution patterns of visual
semantics, which can be transferred across images sharing similar semantics, is
not exploited. In this paper, we propose the Generative Memory-Guided Semantic
Reasoning Model (GM-SRM), which not only learns the intra-image priors from the
known regions, but also distills the inter-image reasoning priors to infer the
content of the corrupted regions. In particular, the proposed GM-SRM first
pre-learns a generative memory from the whole training data to capture the
semantic distribution patterns in a global view. Then the learned memory are
leveraged to retrieve the matching inter-image priors for the current corrupted
image to perform semantic reasoning during image inpainting. While the
intra-image priors are used for guaranteeing the pixel-level content
consistency, the inter-image priors are favorable for performing high-level
semantic reasoning, which is particularly effective for inferring semantic
content for large corrupted area. Extensive experiments on Paris Street View,
CelebA-HQ, and Places2 benchmarks demonstrate that our GM-SRM outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods for image inpainting in terms of both the visual
quality and quantitative metrics.

tasks, and can be computed efficiently through the fast Fourier transform (FFT)
algorithm. However, many applications involve an underlying continuous signal,
and a more natural choice would be to work with e.g. the Fourier series (FS)
coefficients in order to avoid the additional overhead of translating between
the analog and discrete domains. Unfortunately, there exists very little
literature and tools for the manipulation of FS coefficients from discrete
samples. This paper introduces a Python library called pyFFS for efficient FS
coefficient computation, convolution, and interpolation. While the libraries
SciPy and NumPy provide efficient functionality for discrete Fourier transform
coefficients via the FFT algorithm, pyFFS addresses the computation of FS
coefficients through what we call the fast Fourier series (FFS). Moreover,
pyFFS includes an FS interpolation method based on the chirp Z-transform that
can make it more than an order of magnitude faster than the SciPy equivalent
when one wishes to perform interpolation. GPU support through the CuPy library

operating our system in the strong dispersive regime, where a superconducting

observed order like the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting orders of the

and it overlaps other orders in the phase diagram. Because of this diversity
and complexity it has been far from clear whether or not the charge order has a
direct relevance to superconductivity and to the mysterious pseudogap
phenomenon. However, the research development in the last few years has been
successful in revealing universal aspects of the charge order and its
fluctuations. It turns out that the charge order is compatible with
superconductivity, and that its fluctuations have high onset temperature and
high energy scale comparable to those of the pseudogap. The charge order
correlations might be indispensable for creating the pseudogap and possibly
generating high-Tc superconductivity by collaborating with spin and pairing
correlations.

(DESs), the local supervisors observe event occurrences subject to observation
delays to make correct control decisions. Delay coobservability describes
whether these local supervisors can make sufficient observations. In this
paper, we provide an efficient way to verify delay coobservability. For each
controllable event, we partition the specification language into a finite
number of sets such that strings in different sets have different lengths. For
each of the sets, we construct a verifier to check if delay coobservability
holds for the controllable event. The computational complexity of the proposed
approach is polynomial with respect to the number of states, the number of
events, and the upper bounds on observation delays and only exponential with
respect to the number of local supervisors. It has lower complexity order than
the existing approaches. In addition, we investigate the relationship between
the decentralized supervisory control of networked DESs and the decentralized
fault diagnosis of networked DESs and show that delay $K$-codiagnosability is
transformable to delay coobservability. Thus, techniques for the verification
of delay coobservability can be leveraged to verify delay $K$-codiagnosability.

(phase angle ranging $\sim$26--5 deg) to constrain the properties of the dust
particles of 67P and therefrom diagnose the dust environment of its coma and
near-surface layer at around the end of the Southern summer of the comet. We
examined the optical behaviours of the dust, which, together with Rosetta
colour data, were used to search for dust evolution with cometocentric
distance. Modelling was also conducted to identify the dust attributes
compatible with the results. The spectral dependence of the polarisation degree
of 67P dust is flatter than found in other dynamical groups of comets in
similar observing geometry. The depth of its negative polarisation branch
appears to be a bit shallower than in long-period comets and might be getting
shallower as 67P repeats its apparitions. Its dust colour shows a change in
slope around 5,500 Angstrom, (17.3 $\pm$ 1.4) and (10.9 $\pm$ 0.6) % (1,000
Angstrom)$^{\rm -1}$ for shortward and longward of the wavelength,
respectively, which are slightly redder but broadly consistent with the average
of Jupiter-Family comets. Observations of 67P dust in this study can be
attributed to dust agglomerates of $\sim$100 $\mu$m in size detected by Rosetta
in early 2016. A porosity of 60 % shows the best match with our polarimetric
results, yielding a dust density of $\sim$770 kg m$^{\rm -3}$. Compilation of
Rosetta and our data indicates the dust's reddening with increasing nucleus
distance, which may be driven by water-ice sublimation as the dust moves out of
the nucleus. We estimate the possible volume fraction of water ice in the
initially ejected dust as $\sim$6 % (i.e. the refractory-to-ice volume ratio of
$\sim$14).

established mathematical models that capture the characteristics of different
communication modules. Unfortunately, such design cannot be easily and directly
applied to future wireless networks, which will be characterized by large-scale
ultra-dense networks whose design complexity scales exponentially with the
network size. Furthermore, such networks will vary dynamically in a significant
way, which makes it intractable to develop comprehensive analytical models.
Recently, deep learning-based approaches have emerged as potential alternatives
for designing complex and dynamic wireless systems. However, existing
learning-based methods have limited capabilities to scale with the problem size
and to generalize with varying network settings. In this paper, we propose a
scalable and generalizable neural calibration framework for future wireless
system design, where a neural network is adopted to calibrate the input of
conventional model-based algorithms. Specifically, the backbone of a
traditional time-efficient algorithm is integrated with deep neural networks to
achieve a high computational efficiency, while enjoying enhanced performance.
The permutation equivariance property, carried out by the topological structure
of wireless systems, is furthermore utilized to develop a generalizable neural
network architecture. The proposed neural calibration framework is applied to
solve challenging resource management problems in massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Simulation results will show that the proposed
neural calibration approach enjoys significantly improved scalability and

Advanced reasoning, decision-making, and execution skills enable an intelligent

is a fundamental capability of humans that has been deeply studied in various
fields, such as psychology, military, aerospace, and education. Nevertheless,
it has yet to be considered in robotics, which has focused on single
compartmentalized concepts such as sensing, spatial perception, sensor fusion,
state estimation, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Hence, the
present research aims to connect the broad multidisciplinary existing knowledge
to pave the way for a complete SA system for mobile robotics that we deem
paramount for autonomy. To this aim, we define the principal components to
structure a robotic SA and their area of competence. Accordingly, this paper
investigates each aspect of SA, surveying the state-of-the-art robotics
algorithms that cover them, and discusses their current limitations.
Remarkably, essential aspects of SA are still immature since the current
algorithmic development restricts their performance to only specific
environments. Nevertheless, Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Deep
Learning (DL), has brought new methods to bridge the gap that maintains these
fields apart from the deployment to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an
opportunity has been discovered to interconnect the vastly fragmented space of
robotic comprehension algorithms through the mechanism of Situational Graph

finally shape our vision for the future of robotic Situational Awareness by
discussing interesting recent research directions.

event detection mainly relies on time-frequency patterns to distinguish
different sound classes, direction-of-arrival estimation uses amplitude and/or
phase differences between microphones to estimate source directions. As a
result, it is often difficult to jointly optimize these two subtasks. We
propose a novel feature called Spatial cue-Augmented Log-SpectrogrAm (SALSA)

directional cues, which is crucial for resolving overlapping sound sources. The
SALSA feature consists of multichannel log-spectrograms stacked along with the
normalized principal eigenvector of the spatial covariance matrix at each
corresponding time-frequency bin. Depending on the microphone array format, the
principal eigenvector can be normalized differently to extract amplitude and/or
phase differences between the microphones. As a result, SALSA features are
applicable for different microphone array formats such as first-order
ambisonics (FOA) and multichannel microphone array (MIC). Experimental results

discharges achieving high ion temperatures at the core featured an ITG-like
suppression of density fluctuations driven by a reduction of the gradient ratio
$\eta_i = L_n/L_{T_i}$ [D. Carralero et al., Nucl. Fusion, 2021]. In order to
confirm the role of ITG turbulence in this process, we set out to establish
experimentally the relation between core density fluctuations, turbulent heat
flux and global confinement. With this aim, we consider the scenarios found in
the previous work and carry out power balance analysis for a number of
representative ones, including some featuring high ion temperature. As well, we
evaluate the global energy confinement time and discuss it in the context of
the ISS04 inter-stellarator scaling. We find that, when turbulence is
suppressed as a result of a reduction of $\eta_i$, there is a reduction of ion
turbulent transport, and global performance is improved as a result. This is
consistent with ITG turbulence limiting the ion temperature at the core of
W7-X. In contrast, when turbulence is reduced following a decrease in
collisionality, no changes are observed in transport or confinement. This could
be explained by ITG modes being combined with TEM turbulence when the later is
destabilized at low collisionalities.

complex clinical pathways. They are diagnosed and treated by different

Coordination of care for these patients is often challenging, and it would be
of great benefit to get better insight into how the clinical pathways develop
in reality. Discovering these pathways using traditional process mining
techniques and standard event logs may be difficult because the patient is
involved in several highly independent clinical processes. Our objective is to
explore the potential of analyzing these pathways using an event log

question is: How can we identify valuable insights by using a multi-entity
event data representation for clinical pathways of multi-morbid patients? Our
method was built on the idea to represent multiple entities in event logs as
event graphs. The MIMIC-III data-set was used to evaluate the feasibility of
this approach. Several clinical entities were identified and then mapped into
an event graph. Finally, multi-entity directly follows graphs were discovered
by querying the event graph visualizing them. Our result shows that paths
involving multiple entities include traditional process mining concepts not for
one clinical process but all involved processes. In addition, the relationship
between activities of different clinical processes, which was not recognizable
in traditional models, is visible in the event graph representation.

tool for reducing the computational footprint of models at training and

work over the years has been dedicated to specialised pruning techniques,
little attention has been paid to the inherent effect of gradient based
training on model sparsity. In this work, we introduce Powerpropagation, a new
weight-parameterisation for neural networks that leads to inherently sparse
models. Exploiting the behaviour of gradient descent, our method gives rise to
weight updates exhibiting a ""rich get richer"" dynamic, leaving low-magnitude
parameters largely unaffected by learning. Models trained in this manner
exhibit similar performance, but have a distribution with markedly higher
density at zero, allowing more parameters to be pruned safely. Powerpropagation
is general, intuitive, cheap and straight-forward to implement and can readily
be combined with various other techniques. To highlight its versatility, we
explore it in two very different settings: Firstly, following a recent line of
work, we investigate its effect on sparse training for resource-constrained
settings. Here, we combine Powerpropagation with a traditional weight-pruning
technique as well as recent state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse algorithms,
showing superior performance on the ImageNet benchmark. Secondly, we advocate
the use of sparsity in overcoming catastrophic forgetting, where compressed
representations allow accommodating a large number of tasks at fixed model
capacity. In all cases our reparameterisation considerably increases the
efficacy of the off-the-shelf methods.

reaction 13C({\alpha},n)16O, taking place in thermally pulsing Asymptotic Giant
Branch stars at temperatures around 90 MK. To model the nucleosynthesis during
this process the reaction cross section needs to be known in the 150-230keV
energy window (Gamow peak). At these sub-Coulomb energies cross section direct
measurements are severely affected by the low event rate, making us rely on
input from indirect methods and extrapolations from higher-energy direct data.
This leads to an uncertainty in the cross section at the relevant energies too
high to reliably constrain the nuclear physics input to s-process calculations.
We present the results from a new deep-underground measurement of
13C({\alpha},n)16O, covering the energy range 230-300keV, with drastically
reduced uncertainties over previous measurements and for the first time

nuclear properties, however, for constraining the high density equation of
state it is necessary to resort to indirect information obtained from the
observation of neutron stars, compact objects that may have a central density
several times nuclear matter saturation density, $n_0$. Taking a meta-modelling
approach to generate a huge set of equation of state that satisfy nuclear
matter properties close to $n_0$ and that do not contain a first order phase
transition, the possibility of constraining the high density equation of state
was investigated. The entire information obtained from the GW170817 event for
the probability distribution of $\tilde{\Lambda}$ was used to make a
probabilistic inference of the EOS, which goes beyond the constraints imposed
by nuclear matter properties. Nuclear matter properties close to saturation,
below $2n_0$, do not allow us to distinguish between equations of state that
predict different neutron star (NS) maximum masses. This is, however, not true
if the equation of state is constrained at low densities by the tidal
deformability of the NS merger associated to GW170817. Above $3n_0$,
differences may be large, for both approaches, and, in particular, the pressure
and speed of sound of the sets studied do not overlap, showing that the
knowledge of the NS maximum mass may give important information on the high
density EOS. Narrowing the maximum mass uncertainty interval will have a
sizeable effect on constraining the high density EOS.

demonstrate marginal utility of applying CNN and GNN architectures compared to
FCNN for a fixed grid topology. However, with variable topology (for instance,

straightforwardly take the change of topological information into account and
outperform both FCNN and CNN models.

most scientists: a necessary tool in order to cope with the increasing amounts
of scientific literature being published. Commercial citation indexes are
designed for the sciences and have uneven coverage and unsatisfactory
characteristics for humanities scholars, while no comprehensive citation index
is published by a public organization. We argue that an open citation index for
the humanities is desirable, for four reasons: it would greatly improve and
accelerate the retrieval of sources, it would offer a way to interlink
collections across repositories (such as archives and libraries), it would
foster the adoption of metadata standards and best practices by all
stakeholders (including publishers) and it would contribute research data to
fields such as bibliometrics and science studies. We also suggest that the
citation index should be informed by a set of requirements relevant to the
humanities. We discuss four such requirements: source coverage must be
comprehensive, including books and citations to primary sources; there needs to
be chronological depth, as scholarship in the humanities remains relevant over
time; the index should be collection-driven, leveraging the accumulated
thematic collections of specialized research libraries; and it should be rich
in context in order to allow for the qualification of each citation, for
example by providing citation excerpts. We detail the fit-for-purpose research
infrastructure which can make the Humanities Citation Index a reality.
Ultimately, we argue that a citation index for the humanities can be created by
humanists, via a collaborative, distributed and open effort.

to depend on adult or juvenile population densities. A numerical study with
Ricker density-dependence suggested that when competition coefficients acting
on juvenile survival and fertility reflect opposite competitive hierarchies,
stage structure could foster coexistence. We revisit and expand those results.
First, through a Beverton-Holt two-species juvenile-adult model, we confirm
that these findings do not depend on the specifics of density-dependence or
life cycles, and obtain analytical expressions explaining how this coexistence
emerging from stage structure can occur. Second, we show using a
community-level sensitivity analysis that such emergent coexistence is robust
to perturbations of parameter values. Finally, we ask whether these results
extend from two to many species, using simulations. We show that they do not,
as coexistence emerging from stage structure is only seen for very similar
life-history parameters. Such emergent coexistence is therefore not likely to
be a key mechanism of coexistence in very diverse ecosystems, although it may
contribute to explaining coexistence of certain pairs of intensely competing

core of neutron star (NS)s and its relation to non-radial oscillation modes in
NSs and hybrid star (HS)s. We use relativistic mean field (RMF) models to
describe the nuclear matter at low densities and zero temperature. The
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is used to describe the quark matter at high
densities and zero temperature. A Gibbs construct is used to describe the
hadron-quark phase transition (HQPT) at large densities. Within the model, as
the density increases, a mixed phase (MP) appears at density about $2.5$ times
the nuclear matter saturation density $(\rho_0)$ and ends at density about $5
\rho_0$ beyond which the pure quark matter phase appears. It turns out that a
stable HS of maximum mass, $M=2.27 M_{\odot}$ with radius $R=14$ km (for NL3
parameterisation of nuclear RMF model), can exist with the quark matter in the
core in a MP only. HQPT in the core of maximum mass HS occurs at radial
distance, $r_c=0.27R$ where the equilibrium speed of sound shows a
discontinuity. Existence of quark matter in the core enhances the non-radial
oscillation frequencies in HSs compared to NSs of the same mass. This
enhancement is significantly large for the $g$ modes. Such an enhancement of
the $g$ modes is also seen for a density dependent Bayesian (DDB)
parmeterisation of the nucleonic EOS. The non-radial oscillation frequencies
depend on the vector coupling in the NJL model. The values of $g$ and $f$ mode
frequencies decrease with increase the vector coupling in quark matter.

mechanisms of gravitational wave (GW) emission in fast-spinning white dwarfs
(WDs): accretion of matter and magnetic deformation. In both cases, the GW
emission is generated by an asymmetry around the rotation axis of the star.
However, in the first case, the asymmetry is due to the amount of accreted
matter in the magnetic poles, while in the second case it is due to the intense
magnetic field. We have estimated the GW amplitude and luminosity for three
binary systems that have a fast-spinning magnetized WD, namely, AE Aquarii, AR
Scorpii and RX J0648.0-4418. In addition, we applied the magnetic deformation
mechanism for SGRs/AXPs described as WD pulsars. We found that, for the first
mechanism, the systems AE Aquarii and RX J0648.0-4418 can be observed by the
space detectors BBO and DECIGO if they have an amount of accreted mass of
$\delta m \geq 10^{-5}M_{\odot }$. For the second mechanism, the three systems
studied require that the WD has a magnetic field above $\sim 10^{9}$ G to emit
GWs that can be detected by BBO. Furthermore, we found that some SGRs/AXPs as
WD pulsars can be detected by BBO and DECIGO, whereas SGRs/AXPs as highly
magnetized neutron stars are far below the sensitivity curves of these
detectors.

(BINet) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in both bounded and
unbounded domains. Unlike existing solutions that directly operate over
original PDEs, BINet learns to solve, as a proxy, associated boundary integral
equations using neural networks. The benefits are three-fold. Firstly, only the
boundary conditions need to be fitted since the PDE can be automatically
satisfied with single or double layer representations according to the
potential theory. Secondly, the dimension of the boundary integral equations is
typically smaller, and as such, the sample complexity can be reduced
significantly. Lastly, in the proposed method, all differential operators of
the original PDEs have been removed, hence the numerical efficiency and
stability are improved. Adopting neural tangent kernel (NTK) techniques, we
provide proof of the convergence of BINets in the limit that the width of the
neural network goes to infinity. Extensive numerical experiments show that,
without calculating high-order derivatives, BINet is much easier to train and
usually gives more accurate solutions, especially in the cases that the
boundary conditions are not smooth enough. Further, BINet outperforms strong
baselines for both one single PDE and parameterized PDEs in the bounded and
unbounded domains.

role, the effect of the latter on the interaction dynamics as well as thin film
properties are scarcely clarified (concurrent or causative). The inherent
overlay of the ion bombardment induced processes render an isolation of their
contribution impracticable. In this work, this issue is addressed by comparing
the results of two case studies on the sputter deposition of Al thin films in
Ar working gas. In the first run Ar atoms are fully retained. In the second run
they are artificially neglected, as implanted Ar atoms are assumed to outgas
anyhow and not alter the ongoing dynamics significantly. Both case studies have
in common that the consecutive impingement of 100 particles (i.e., Ar$^+$ ions,
Al atoms) onto Al(001) surfaces for ion energies in the range of 3 eV to 300 eV

  explanations, mostly in the Abstract and Introduction",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A detailed investigation of a superconducting spin-triplet valve is
presented. This spin-valve consists of a superconducting film covering a metal
with an intrinsic spiral magnetic order, which could result from competing
isotropic exchanges or, if the crystal lattice breaks central symmetry, from
asymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange. Depending on the anisotropy, such a
metal may change its magnetization either from a spiral to uniform order, as
seen in Ho and Er, or in the direction of the spiral itself, as in crystals of
the B20-type structure (such as MnSi, (Fe,Co)Si, FeGe, etc.). The nonuniform
magnetic order controls the appearance of long-range triplet superconducting
correlations at strong exchange fields, affecting the detailed character of the
proximity effect. We show that the magnetic control of the spin-valve behavior
can also be obtained from moderately low exchange fields (typically associated
to negligible long-range triplet correlations), thanks to an
orientation-dependent averaging mechanism of the magnetic inhomogeneity on the
scale of the Cooper pairs. Our numerical calculations reveal that the
spin-valve effect is in fact magnified at moderately low exchange fields, when
the exchange splitting in the spiral magnet is comparable to the
superconducting gap, and the spiral period is less than or equal to the
superconducting coherence length in the magnet multiplied by $2\pi$.

  Human-human Interaction",,,,,"cs.GR cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Creating realistic characters that can react to the users' or another
character's movement can benefit computer graphics, games and virtual reality
hugely. However, synthesizing such reactive motions in human-human interactions
is a challenging task due to the many different ways two humans can interact.
While there are a number of successful researches in adapting the generative
adversarial network (GAN) in synthesizing single human actions, there are very
few on modelling human-human interactions. In this paper, we propose a
semi-supervised GAN system that synthesizes the reactive motion of a character
given the active motion from another character. Our key insights are two-fold.
First, to effectively encode the complicated spatial-temporal information of a
human motion, we empower the generator with a part-based long short-term memory
(LSTM) module, such that the temporal movement of different limbs can be
effectively modelled. We further include an attention module such that the
temporal significance of the interaction can be learned, which enhances the
temporal alignment of the active-reactive motion pair. Second, as the reactive
motion of different types of interactions can be significantly different, we
introduce a discriminator that not only tells if the generated movement is
realistic or not, but also tells the class label of the interaction. This
allows the use of such labels in supervising the training of the generator. We
experiment with the SBU and the HHOI datasets. The high quality of the
synthetic motion demonstrates the effective design of our generator, and the
discriminability of the synthesis also demonstrates the strength of our
discriminator.

a Progressive Fourier Aggregation (PFA) at the server to achieve more stable

stars, allowing for the generation of transmission spectra; the study of
exoplanet atmospheres relies heavily upon accurate analysis of these spectra.
Recent discoveries mean that the study of atmospheric signals from low-mass,
temperate worlds are becoming increasingly common. The observed transit depth
in these planets is small and more difficult to analyze. Analysis of simulated
transmission spectra for two small, temperate planets (GJ 1214 b and K2-18 b)
is presented, giving evidence for significant differences in simulated transit
depth when the water vapor continuum is accounted for when compared to models
omitting it. These models use cross-sections from the CAVIAR lab experiment for
the water self-continuum up to 10,000 cm$^{-1}$; these cross-sections exhibit
an inverse relationship with temperature, hence lower-temperature atmospheres
are the most significantly impacted. Including the water continuum strongly
affects transit depths, increasing values by up to 80 ppm, with the differences
for both planets being detectable with the future space missions Ariel and
JWST. It is imperative that models of exoplanet spectra move toward adaptive
cross-sections, increasingly optimized for H$_2$O-rich atmospheres. This
necessitates including absorption contribution from the water vapor continuum
into atmospheric simulations.

histopathology images is vital for accurate diagnosis. Although deep learning
(DL) based segmentation methods achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, they rely on
large datasets with manual annotations. We propose a method to synthesize for
PCa histopathology images by learning the geometrical relationship between
different disease labels using self-supervised learning. We use a weakly
supervised segmentation approach that uses Gleason score to segment the
diseased regions and the resulting segmentation map is used to train a Shape
Restoration Network (ShaRe-Net) to predict missing mask segments in a
self-supervised manner. Using DenseUNet as the backbone generator architecture
we incorporate latent variable sampling to inject diversity in the image
generation process and thus improve robustness. Experiments on multiple
histopathology datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
competing image synthesis methods for segmentation tasks. Ablation studies show
the benefits of integrating geometry and diversity in generating high-quality
images, and our self-supervised approach with limited class-labeled data
achieves similar performance as fully supervised learning.

only $75\,\mathrm{Mb/s}$ of attack traffic. OpenVPN can be overwhelmed with
$100\,\mathrm{Mb/s}$ of flood traffic denying data transfer through the VPN

revealed implementation bugs and major inefficiencies in the implementations
related to concurrency aspects. These findings demonstrate a need for more

found that despite the environment being relevant in setting the conditions to
misalign the star-forming gas, the internal galaxy properties play a crucial
role in determining whether the gas quickly aligns with the stellar component

display more misalignments because they are inefficient at realigning the

MicroBooNE's first three years of operations (6.80$\times$10$^{20}$ protons on

without charged leptons in the final state ($1\gamma1p$ and $1\gamma0p$,

measurement of NC $\pi^0$ events, made possible via dedicated $2\gamma1p$ and
$2\gamma0p$ selections. A total of 16 and 153 events are observed for the

the normalization of NC $\Delta$ radiative decay of less than $2.3$ times the

measurement disfavors a candidate photon interpretation of the MiniBooNE
low-energy excess as a factor of $3.18$ times the nominal NC $\Delta$ radiative

TR-PL measurements. Accordingly, the individual bright states must be taken

derived model can be generalized for any isotropically or anisotropically

of an orthotropic material. If compared with the classical model of the
isotropic plate, the relaxed condition of orthotropy increases the degrees of
freedom as a consequence of the larger number of elastic parameters, thus
allowing to better describe rectangular plates having different behaviors in
the two directions parallel to the edges of the rectangle.
  We have in mind structures like decks of bridges where the rigidity in the
direction of their length does not necessarily coincide with the one in the
direction of its width.
  We introduce some basic notions from the theory of linear elasticity, having
a special attention for the theory of orthotropic materials. In particular we
recall the Hooke's law in its general setting and we explain how it can be
simplified under the orthotropy assumption.
  Following the approach of the Kirchhoff-Love model, we obtain the bending
energy of an orthotropic plate and from it the corresponding equilibrium
equation when the plate is subject to the action of a vertical load.
Accordingly, we write the kinetic energy of the plate which combined with the
bending energy gives the complete Lagrangian; classical variational methods
then produces the equation of motion.

radial pulsations observed in the extreme helium star V652 Her. These use a
finer zoning to allow higher radial resolution than in previous simulations.
Models incorporate updated OPAL and OP opacity tables and adopt a composition
based on the best atmospheric analyses to date. Key pulsation properties
including period, velocity amplitude and shock acceleration are examined as a
function of the mean stellar parameters (mass, luminosity, and effective
temperature). The new models confirm that, for large amplitude pulsations, a
strong shock develops at minimum radius, and is associated with a large phase
delay between maximum brightness and minimum radius. Using the observed
pulsation period to constrain parameter space in one dimension, other pulsation
properties are used to constrain the model space further, and to critically
discuss observational measurements. Similar models may be useful for the
interpretation of other blue large amplitude pulsators, which may also exhibit
pulsation-driven shocks.

data manifolds that contain holes, without discarding any topological
information. Manifold learning aims to embed high dimensional data into a lower
dimensional Euclidean space by learning a coordinate chart, but it requires
that the entire manifold can be embedded in a single chart. This is impossible
for manifolds with holes. In such cases, it is necessary to learn an atlas: a
collection of charts that collectively cover the entire manifold. We begin with
many small charts, and combine them in a bottom-up approach, where charts are
only combined if doing so will not introduce problematic topological features.
When it is no longer possible to combine any charts, each chart is individually
embedded with standard manifold learning techniques, completing the
construction of the atlas. We show the efficacy of our method by constructing
atlases for challenging synthetic manifolds; learning human motion embeddings
from motion capture data; and learning kinematic models of articulated objects.

laboratory and literature-derived absorption spectra of potential aqueous-phase
prebiotic UV absorbers with literature estimates of their concentrations on

that prebiotic freshwaters were largely transparent in the UV, contrary to
assumptions by some models of prebiotic chemistry. Some waters, e.g.,
high-salinity waters like carbonate lakes, may be deficient in shortwave
($\leq220$ nm) UV flux. More dramatically, ferrous waters can be strongly
UV-shielded, particularly if the Fe$^{2+}$ forms highly UV-absorbent species
like Fe(CN)$_6^{4-}$. Such waters may be compelling venues for UV-averse
origin-of-life scenarios, but are disfavorable for some UV-dependent prebiotic
chemistries. UV light can trigger photochemistry even if attenuated through
photochemical transformations of the absorber (e.g., $e^{-}_{aq}$ production
from halide irradiation), which may have both constructive and destructive
effects for prebiotic syntheses. Prebiotic chemistries invoking waters
containing such absorbers must self-consistently account for the chemical
effects of these transformations. The speciation and abundance of Fe$^{2+}$ in
natural waters on early Earth is a major uncertainty, and should be prioritized
for further investigation as it plays a major role in UV transmission in
prebiotic natural waters.

Estimating the geographic location of mobile devices is an essential step for

which is based on the assumption that mobile devices are always connected to
the nearest radio cell. This paper uses a modular Bayesian approach, allowing
for different modules of prior knowledge about where devices are expected to
be, and different modules for the likelihood of connection given a geographic
location. We discuss and compare the use of several prior modules, including
one that is based on land use. We show that the Voronoi tessellation can be
used as a likelihood module. Alternatively, we propose a signal strength model
using radio cell properties such as antenna height, propagation direction, and
power. Using Bayes' rule, we derive a posterior probability distribution that
is an estimate for the geographic location, which can be used for further
statistical inference. We describe the method and provide illustrations of a
fictional example that resembles a real-world situation. The method has been

ultraviolet mirrors exposed to atomic hydrogen. Hydrogen permeation through
ruthenium is problematic as it leads to blisters on the mirrors. H has been
shown to exhibit low solubility in bulk Ru, and rapidly diffuses in and out of
Ru. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms of the blistering effect remains
unknown. This work makes use of reactive molecular dynamics simulations to
study the influence of imperfections in a Ru film on the behaviour of H. For
the Ru/H system, a ReaxFF force field was parametrised which reproduces
structures and energies obtained from quantum-mechanical calculations.
Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed with the newly-developed
force field, to study the effect of tilt and twist grain boundaries on the
overall diffusion behaviour of H in Ru. Our simulations show the tilt and twist
grain boundaries provide energetically favourable sites for hydrogen atoms and
act as sinks and highways for H. They therefore block H transport across their
planes, and favour diffusion along their planes. This results in the
accumulation of hydrogen at the grain boundaries. The strong effect of the
grain boundaries on the hydrogen diffusion suggests tailoring the morphology of
ruthenium thin films as a means to curb the rate of hydrogen permeation.

associated with the properties of the neutron star (NS) crust with theoretical
estimates of the uncertainties associated with the equation of state (EOS) of
homogeneous neutron and nuclear matter. For the latter, we employ recent
calculations based on Hamiltonians constructed using Chiral Effective Field
theory. Fits to experimental nuclear masses are employed to constrain the CLDM
further, and we find that they disfavor some of the Chiral Hamiltonians. The
CLDM allows us to study the complex interplay between bulk, surface, curvature,
and Coulomb contributions, and their impact on the NS crust. It also reveals
how the curvature energy alters the correlation between the surface energy and
the bulk symmetry energy. Our analysis quantifies how the uncertainties
associated with the EOS of homogeneous matter implies significant uncertainties
for the composition of the crust, its proton fraction, and the volume fraction
occupied by nuclei. We find that the finite-size effects impact the crust
composition, but have a negligible effect on the net isospin asymmetry of
matter. The isospin asymmetry is largely determined by the bulk properties and
the isospin dependence of the surface energy. The most significant
uncertainties associated with matter properties in the densest regions of the
crust, the precise location of the crust-core transition, are found to be
strongly correlated with uncertainties associated with the Hamiltonians. By
adopting a unified model to describe the crust and the core of NSs, we tighten
the correlation between their global properties such as their mass-radius
relationship, moment of inertia, crust thickness, and tidal deformability with

to resolve three-dimensional structures of dynamically evolving singular
topological defects. Here, we report a direct confocal observation of nematic
liquid crystalline defect lines, called disclinations, relaxing from an
electrically driven turbulent state. We focus in particular on reconnections,
characteristic of such line defects. We find a scaling law for in-plane
reconnection events, by which the distance between reconnecting disclinations
decreases by the square root of time to the reconnection. Moreover, we show
that apparently asymmetric dynamics of reconnecting disclinations is actually
symmetric in a comoving frame, in marked contrast to the two-dimensional
counterpart whose asymmetry is established. We argue, with experimental
supports, that this is because of energetically favorable symmetric twist
configurations that disclinations take spontaneously, thanks to the topology
that allows for rotation of the winding axis. Our work illustrates a general
mechanism of such spontaneous symmetry restoring that may apply beyond liquid
crystal, which can take place if topologically distinct asymmetric defects in
lower dimensions become homeomorphic in higher dimensions and if the symmetric
intermediate is energetically favorable.

twice weekly testing, which was adequate for the original strains of SARS-CoV-2
will be insufficient on its own to contain the spread of the Delta variant of
concern. We exclude consideration of contact tracing since the rapidity of the
onset of viral titre in the case of the Delta variant suggests that unless
contact tracing and quarantine are performed very rapidly (ie. much less than a
day), these mitigations will be of minimal impact in reducing transmission.
These crude estimates do not take into account heterogeneity of susceptibility,
social activity, and compliance, nor do they include the additional reduction
in transmission that could be achieved by masking and social distancing. In the
setting of a large public university, these considerations suggest that
risk-targeted testing of vaccinated students, staff and faculty combined with

form more direct and physically motivated than the expression (scheme I) that
was used in our previous works within the CDFM and avoids preliminary
assumptions and mathematical ambiguities in scheme I. The calculations are
based on the Skyrme and Brueckner energy-density functionals for nuclear matter

Bonn CD nucleon-nucleon potentials. The approach is applied to isotopic chains
of Ni, Sn, and Pb nuclei using nuclear densities obtained in self-consistent

applicability of both schemes within the CDFM is demonstrated by a comparison
of the results with the available empirical data and with results of other

the results obtained for the studied ratio and the symmetry energy components
are rather close in both schemes, the new scheme II leads to more realistic
values that agree better with the empirical data and exhibits conceptual and

metallicities across the discs of nearby galaxies at scales $\lesssim 100~$ pc.
At such small scales, many of these regions contain too few stars to fully
sample all possible stellar masses and evolutionary states, leading to
stochastic fluctuations in the ionising continuum. The impact of these
fluctuations on the line diagnostics used to infer galaxy metallicities is
poorly understood. In this paper, we quantify this impact for six most
commonly-used diagnostics. We generate stochastic stellar populations for
galaxy patches with star formation rates varying over a factor of $1000$,
compute the nebular emission that results when these stars ionise gas at a wide
range of densities, metallicities, and determine how much inferred
metallicities vary with fluctuations in the driving stellar spectrum. We find
that metallicities derived from diagnostics that measure multiple ionisation
states of their target elements (e.g.~electron temperature methods) are weakly
affected (variation $< 0.1$ dex), but that larger fluctuations ($\sim 0.4$ dex)
occur for diagnostics that depend on a single ionisation state. Scatter in the
inferred metallicity is generally largest at low star formation rate and
metallicity, and is larger for more sensitive observations than for shallower
ones. The main cause of the fluctuations is stochastic variation in the
ionisation state in the nebula in response to the absence of Wolf-Rayet stars,
which dominate the production of $\gtrsim 2-3$ Ryd photons. Our results
quantify the trade-off between line brightness and diagnostic accuracy, and can
be used to optimise observing strategies for future IFU campaigns.

reduction (SDR) method for Fr\'echet regression to achieve two purposes: to
mitigate the curse of dimensionality caused by high-dimensional predictors and
to provide a visual inspection tool for Fr\'echet regression. Our approach is
flexible enough to turn any existing SDR method for Euclidean (X,Y) into one
for Euclidean X and metric space-valued Y. The basic idea is to first map the
metric-space valued random object $Y$ to a real-valued random variable $f(Y)$
using a class of functions, and then perform classical SDR to the transformed
data. If the class of functions is sufficiently rich, then we are guaranteed to
uncover the Fr\'echet SDR space. We showed that such a class, which we call an
ensemble, can be generated by a universal kernel. We established the
consistency and asymptotic convergence rate of the proposed methods. The
finite-sample performance of the proposed methods is illustrated through
simulation studies for several commonly encountered metric spaces that include
Wasserstein space, the space of symmetric positive definite matrices, and the

research today. Hardware speed and capability have increased exponentially, but
the software is years behind. The demand for software has also increased
significantly, but it is still written in old fashion: by using humans.
  There are multiple problems when the work is done by humans: cost, time,
quality. It is costly to pay humans, it is hard to keep them satisfied for a
long time, it takes a lot of time to teach and train them and the quality of
their output is in most cases low (in software, mostly due to bugs).
  The real advances in human civilization appeared during the industrial
revolutions. Before the first revolution, most people worked in agriculture.
Today, very few percent of people work in this field.
  A similar revolution must appear in the computer programming field.
Otherwise, we will have so many people working in this field as we had in the
past working in agriculture.
  How do people know how to write computer programs? Very simple: by learning.
Can we do the same for software? Can we put the software to learn how to write
software?
  It seems that is possible (to some degree) and the term is called Machine
Learning. It was first coined in 1959 by the first person who made a computer
perform a serious learning task, namely, Arthur Samuel.
  However, things are not so easy as in humans (well, truth to be said - for
some humans it is impossible to learn how to write software). So far we do not

Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH), a wide field survey for 21-cm line absorption
in neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) at intermediate cosmological redshifts. FLASH
will be carried out with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
(ASKAP) radio telescope and is planned to cover the sky south of $\delta
\approx +40$deg at frequencies between 711.5 and 999.5MHz. At redshifts between
$z = 0.4$ and $1.0$ (look back times of 4 - 8Gyr), the HI content of the
Universe has been poorly explored due to the difficulty of carrying out radio
surveys for faint 21-cm line emission and, at ultra-violet wavelengths,
space-borne searches for Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption in quasar spectra.
The ASKAP wide field of view and large spectral bandwidth, in combination with
a radio-quiet site, will enable a search for absorption lines in the radio
spectra of bright continuum sources over 80% of the sky. This survey is
expected to detect at least several hundred intervening 21-cm absorbers, and
will produce an HI-absorption-selected catalogue of galaxies rich in cool,
star-forming gas, some of which may be concealed from optical surveys.
Likewise, at least several hundred associated 21-cm absorbers are expected to
be detected within the host galaxies of radio sources at $0.4 < z < 1.0$,
providing valuable kinematical information for models of gas accretion and
jet-driven feedback in radio-loud active galactic nuclei. FLASH will also
detect OH 18-cm absorbers in diffuse molecular gas, megamaser OH emission,
radio recombination lines, and stacked HI emission.

model less atomic aspects of an entity cannot be measured by metrics, but
rather are evaluated by derived indicators generally modeled by an aggregation

accidents could be avoided by continuously monitoring the driver. Driver
monitoring (DM) is a topic of growing interest in the automotive industry, and
it will remain relevant for all vehicles that are not fully autonomous, and
thus for decades for the average vehicle owner. The present paper focuses on
the first step of DM, which consists in characterizing the state of the driver.
Since DM will be increasingly linked to driving automation (DA), this paper
presents a clear view of the role of DM at each of the six SAE levels of DA.
This paper surveys the state of the art of DM, and then synthesizes it,
providing a unique, structured, polychotomous view of the many characterization
techniques of DM. Informed by the survey, the paper characterizes the driver
state along the five main dimensions--called here ""(sub)states""--of drowsiness,
mental workload, distraction, emotions, and under the influence. The
polychotomous view of DM is presented through a pair of interlocked tables that
relate these states to their indicators (e.g., the eye-blink rate) and the
sensors that can access each of these indicators (e.g., a camera). The tables
factor in not only the effects linked directly to the driver, but also those
linked to the (driven) vehicle and the (driving) environment. They show, at a
glance, to concerned researchers, equipment providers, and vehicle
manufacturers (1) most of the options they have to implement various forms of
advanced DM systems, and (2) fruitful areas for further research and
innovation.

question whether they can also be used to perform classification. Generative
models have been used as adversarially robust classifiers on simple datasets
such as MNIST, but this robustness has not been observed on more complex
datasets like CIFAR-10. Additionally, on natural image datasets, previous
results have suggested a trade-off between the likelihood of the data and
classification accuracy. In this work, we investigate score-based generative
models as classifiers for natural images. We show that these models not only
obtain competitive likelihood values but simultaneously achieve
state-of-the-art classification accuracy for generative classifiers on
CIFAR-10. Nevertheless, we find that these models are only slightly, if at all,
more robust than discriminative baseline models on out-of-distribution tasks
based on common image corruptions. Similarly and contrary to prior results, we
find that score-based are prone to worst-case distribution shifts in the form
of adversarial perturbations. Our work highlights that score-based generative
models are closing the gap in classification accuracy compared to standard
discriminative models. While they do not yet deliver on the promise of
adversarial and out-of-domain robustness, they provide a different approach to
classification that warrants further research.

especially apparent when deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with high memory
and compute demands. FPGAs are commonly available in edge devices. Since these
reconfigurable circuits can achieve higher throughput and lower power
consumption than general purpose processors, they are especially well-suited
for DNN acceleration. However, existing solutions for designing FPGA-based DNN
accelerators for edge devices come with high development overheads, given the
cost of repeated FPGA synthesis passes, reimplementation in a Hardware
Description Language (HDL) of the simulated design, and accelerator system
integration.
  In this paper we propose SECDA, a new hardware/software co-design methodology
to reduce design time of optimized DNN inference accelerators on edge devices
with FPGAs. SECDA combines cost-effective SystemC simulation with hardware
execution, streamlining design space exploration and the development process
via reduced design evaluation time. As a case study, we use SECDA to
efficiently develop two different DNN accelerator designs on a PYNQ-Z1 board, a
platform that includes an edge FPGA. We quickly and iteratively explore the
system's hardware/software stack, while identifying and mitigating performance
bottlenecks. We evaluate the two accelerator designs with four common DNN
models, achieving an average performance speedup across models of up to
3.5$\times$ with a 2.9$\times$ reduction in energy consumption over CPU-only
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/gicLAB/SECDA

  Abyssal Plains",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The majority of Earth's surface lies deep in the oceans, where no surface
light reaches. Robots diving down to great depths must bring light sources that
create moving illumination patterns in the darkness, such that the same 3D
point appears with different color in each image. On top, scattering and
attenuation of light in the water makes images appear foggy and typically
blueish, the degradation depending on each pixel's distance to its observed
seafloor patch, on the local composition of the water and the relative poses
and cones of the light sources. Consequently, visual mapping, including image
matching and surface albedo estimation, severely suffers from the effects that
co-moving light sources produce, and larger mosaic maps from photos are often
dominated by lighting effects that obscure the actual seafloor structure. In
this contribution a practical approach to estimating and compensating these
lighting effects on predominantly homogeneous, flat seafloor regions, as can be
found in the Abyssal plains of our oceans, is presented. The method is
essentially parameter-free and intended as a preprocessing step to facilitate
visual mapping, but already produces convincing lighting artefact compensation
up to a global white balance factor. It does not require to be trained
beforehand on huge sets of annotated images, which are not available for the
deep sea. Rather, we motivate our work by physical models of light propagation,
perform robust statistics-based estimates of additive and multiplicative
nuisances that avoid explicit parameters for light, camera, water or scene,
discuss the breakdown point of the algorithms and show results on imagery
captured by robots in several kilometer water depth.

BICEP3 observations at 95 GHz to the previous 95/150/220 GHz data set. The
$Q/U$ maps now reach depths of 2.8, 2.8 and 8.8 $\mu{\mathrm K}_{cmb}$ arcmin

square degrees at 95 GHz and $\approx 400$ square degrees at 150 & 220 GHz. The
220 GHz maps now achieve a signal-to-noise on polarized dust emission exceeding
that of Planck at 353 GHz. We take auto- and cross-spectra between these maps
and publicly available WMAP and Planck maps at frequencies from 23 to 353 GHz
and evaluate the joint likelihood of the spectra versus a multicomponent model
of lensed-$\Lambda$CDM+$r$+dust+synchrotron+noise. The foreground model has
seven parameters, and no longer requires a prior on the frequency spectral
index of the dust emission taken from measurements on other regions of the sky.
This model is an adequate description of the data at the current noise levels.
The likelihood analysis yields the constraint $r_{0.05}<0.036$ at 95%
confidence. Running maximum likelihood search on simulations we obtain unbiased
results and find that $\sigma(r)=0.009$. These are the strongest constraints to
date on primordial gravitational waves.

very rich amplitude spectrum using the 3-yr light curve. Among these
frequencies, the strongest peak of $f_{1}= 13.20362567(12) \rm{d^{-1}}$ is
identified as the radial fundamental mode, and we also find the first and
second overtones ($f_2$ and $f_3$). In the low frequency range (< 2.5
$\rm{d^{-1}}$), 22 peaks are identified to be gravity modes, which show a
regular period spacing of about 2460\,s and have the angular degree $l = 1$.
The period spacing pattern does not show a significant downward trend,
suggesting the star rotates slowly. We note that this is a $\delta$
Sct--$\gamma$ Dor hybrid star containing a high-amplitude radial fundamental
mode and a regular g-mode period spacing pattern. With O-C analysis, we find
the star shows a significant time delay, implying that the star has a companion

optimization to use denoisers that can be parameterized for non-constant noise
variance. In that aim, we introduce a preconditioning of the ADMM algorithm,
which mathematically justifies the use of such an adjustable denoiser. We
additionally propose a procedure for training a convolutional neural network
for high quality non-blind image denoising that also allows for pixel-wise
control of the noise standard deviation. We show that our pixel-wise adjustable

the plug-and-play ADMM approach for several applications, including image

and potentially mask important underlying structures. Accurate identification
of anomalous samples is crucial for the success of downstream data analysis
tasks. To automatically identify anomalies, we propose Probabilistic Robust
AutoEncoder (PRAE). PRAE aims to simultaneously remove outliers and identify a
low-dimensional representation for the inlier samples. We first present the
Robust AutoEncoder (RAE) objective as a minimization problem for splitting the
data into inliers and outliers. Our objective is designed to exclude outliers
while including a subset of samples (inliers) that can be effectively
reconstructed using an AutoEncoder (AE). RAE minimizes the autoencoder's
reconstruction error while incorporating as many samples as possible. This
could be formulated via regularization by subtracting an $\ell_0$ norm counting
the number of selected samples from the reconstruction term. Unfortunately,
this leads to an intractable combinatorial problem. Therefore, we propose two
probabilistic relaxations of RAE, which are differentiable and alleviate the
need for a combinatorial search. We prove that the solution to the PRAE problem
is equivalent to the solution of RAE. We use synthetic data to show that PRAE
can accurately remove outliers in a wide range of contamination levels.
Finally, we demonstrate that using PRAE for anomaly detection leads to
state-of-the-art results on various benchmark datasets.

2011) as a generalization of the well-studied longest increasing subsequence
problem and its complexity still remains open. An equivalent formulation of the
longest heapable subsequence problem is that of finding a maximum-sized binary
tree in a given permutation directed acyclic graph (permutation DAG). In this
work, we study parameterized algorithms for both longest heapable subsequence
as well as maximum-sized binary tree. We show the following results:
  1. The longest heapable subsequence problem can be solved in
$k^{O(\log{k})}n$ time, where $k$ is the number of distinct values in the input
sequence. We introduce the ""alphabet size"" as a new parameter in the study of
computational problems in permutation DAGs. Our result on longest heapable
subsequence implies that the maximum-sized binary tree problem in a given
permutation DAG is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the alphabet
size.
  2. We show that the alphabet size with respect to a fixed topological
ordering can be computed in polynomial time, admits a min-max relation, and has
a polyhedral description.
  3. We design a fixed-parameter algorithm with run-time $w^{O(w)}n$ for the
maximum-sized binary tree problem in undirected graphs when parameterized by
treewidth $w$.
  Our results make progress towards understanding the complexity of the longest
heapable subsequence and maximum-sized binary tree in permutation DAGs from the
perspective of parameterized algorithms. We believe that the parameter alphabet
size that we introduce is likely to be useful in the context of optimization
problems defined over permutation DAGs.

been measured to be significantly higher than that which can be produced by
known classes of extragalactic sources and most models of Galactic halo

This level of radio anisotropy power indicates that if it results from point
sources, those sources are likely at low fluxes and incredibly numerous, and

impact of U.S governor's party allegiance (Republican vs Democrat) on ethnic
wage gap. A descriptive analysis of the distribution of yearly earnings of
Whites and Blacks reveals a divergence in their respective shapes over time
suggesting that aggregate analysis may mask important heterogeneous effects.
This motivates a granular estimation of the comparative causal effect of
governors' party affiliation on labor market outcomes. We use a regression
discontinuity design (RDD) based on marginal electoral victories and samples of
quantiles groups by wage and hours worked. Overall, the distributional causal
estimations show that the vast majority of subgroups of black workers earnings
are not affected by democrat governors' policies, suggesting the possible
existence of structural factors in the labor markets that contribute to create
and keep a wage trap and/or hour worked trap for most of the subgroups of black
workers. Democrat governors increase the number of hours worked of black
workers at the highest quartiles of earnings. A bivariate quantiles groups
analysis shows that democrats decrease the total hours worked for black workers
who have the largest number of hours worked and earn the least. Black workers
earning more and working fewer hours than half of the sample see their number
of hours worked increase under a democrat governor.

novel Simulated Annealing framework for Graph and Sequence optimization. The
key idea is to integrate powerful neural networks into metaheuristics (e.g.,
simulated annealing, SA) to restrict the search space in discrete optimization.
We start by defining a sophisticated objective function, involving the property
of interest and pre-defined constraints (e.g., grammar validity). SAGS searches
from the discrete space towards this objective by performing a sequence of
local edits, where deep generative neural networks propose the editing content
and thus can control the quality of editing. We evaluate SAGS on paraphrase
generation and molecule generation for sequence optimization and graph
optimization, respectively. Extensive results show that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing paraphrase generation
methods in terms of both automatic and human evaluations. Further, SAGS also
significantly outperforms all the previous methods in molecule generation.

can readily be used to accelerate perovskite PV scaling. Herein, we present an
ML-guided framework of sequential learning for manufacturing process
optimization. We apply our methodology to the Rapid Spray Plasma Processing
(RSPP) technique for perovskite thin films in ambient conditions. With a
limited experimental budget of screening 100 process conditions, we
demonstrated an efficiency improvement to 18.5% as the best-in-our-lab device
fabricated by RSPP, and we also experimentally found 10 unique process
conditions to produce the top-performing devices of more than 17% efficiency,
which is 5 times higher rate of success than the control experiments with
pseudo-random Latin hypercube sampling. Our model is enabled by three
innovations: (a) flexible knowledge transfer between experimental processes by
incorporating data from prior experimental data as a probabilistic constraint;
(b) incorporation of both subjective human observations and ML insights when
selecting next experiments; (c) adaptive strategy of locating the region of
interest using Bayesian optimization first, and then conducting local

our framework achieves faster improvements with limited experimental budgets

features, which have a negative effect on the performance of methods. Moreover,
selecting an appropriate training set is influential in the rise of machine
learning method accuracy. However, in this problem, we face two obstacles to
find the proper training set. First, most methods employ known and unknown

number of known pairs is much less than unknowns, it leads to machine learning
performance error because of biasing to the majority group. Second, the absence

threatening the human population. The dynamics of this pandemic is quite
complicated and prediction of pandemic states often fails. In this work, we
study and correlate the SIR epidemiological model with the ongoing pandemic and
found that pandemic dynamics and states are quite sensitively dependent on
model parameters. The analysis of the exact parametric solution of the
deterministic SIR model shows that the fixed points ($g^*$) depend on the SIR
parameters, where, if $g^*\langle\frac{\gamma}{\beta x_0}$ then $g^*$ is stable
and the pandemic can be controlled, whereas, if $g^*\rangle\frac{\gamma}{\beta
x_0}$ then $g^*$ is unstable indicating active pandemic state, and $g^*=0$
corresponds to an endemic state. The dynamics show asymptotic stability
bifurcation. The analytical solution of the stochastic SIR model allows to
predict endemic time $t_E\propto\frac{1}{\gamma}$ and mean infected population
becomes constant for small values of $\gamma$. The noise in the system even can
modulate pandemic dynamics. Hence, we estimated the values of these parameters
during lockdown periods using the ABC SSA algorithm and found strong dependence
on control strategy, namely, lockdown and follows power-law behaviors. The
numerical results show strong agreement with the real data and have the
positive effect of social distancing or lockdown in the pandemic control.

example, accurate calculation of 3D geometries of a small molecule requires
hours of computing time using density functional theory (DFT). Here, we propose
to predict the ground-state 3D geometries from molecular graphs using machine
learning methods. To make this feasible, we develop a benchmark, known as

approximately 4 million molecules derived from DFT. We also provide a set of

Specifically, we propose to assess the error and validity of predicted

predict the pairwise distance between atoms or atom coordinates in 3D space.
Experimental results show that, compared with generating 3D geometries with

The model supports a steady parallel shear flow as a response to the wind
stress. As the maximal velocity of the shear flow (equivalently the maximal
amplitude of the wind forcing) exceeds a critical threshold, the zonal jet
destabilizes due to baroclinic instability and we numerically demonstrate that
a first transition occurs. We obtain reduced equations of the system using the
formalism of dynamic transition theory and establish two scenarios which
completely describe this first transition. The generic scenario is that two
modes become critical and a Hopf bifurcation occurs as a result. Under an
appropriate set of parameters describing midlatitude oceanic flows, we show
that this first transition is continuous: a supercritical Hopf bifurcation
occurs and a stable time periodic solution bifurcates. We also investigate the
case of double Hopf bifurcations which occur when four modes of the linear
stability problem simultaneously destabilize the zonal jet. In this case we
prove that, in the relevant parameter regime, the flow exhibits a continuous
transition accompanied by a bifurcated attractor homeomorphic to $S^3$. The
topological structure of this attractor is analyzed in detail and is shown to

\cite{Ruzziconi:2020wrb} we extend the questions of conservation, integrability
and renormalization in Bondi gauge and in GR to the theory of Topological
Massive Gravity (TMG). We construct the phase space and renormalize the
divergences arising within the symplectic structure through a holographic
renormalization procedure. We show that the charge expressions are generically
finite, conserved and can be made integrable by a field$-$dependent
redefinition of the asymptotic symmetry parameters.

  Design",,,,,"cs.SE stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The classical approach to design a system is based on a deterministic
perspective where the assumption is that the system and its environment are
fully predictable, and their behaviour is completely known to the designer.
Although this approach may work fairly well for regular design problems, it is
not satisfactory for the design of highly sensitive and complex systems where
significant resources and even lives are at risk. In addition it can results in
extra costs of over-designing for the sake of safety and reliability. In this
paper, a risk-based design framework using Simulation Based Probabilistic Risk
Assessment (SIMPRA) methodology is proposed. SIMPRA allows the designer to use
the knowledge that can be expected to exist at the design stage to identify how
deviations can occur; and then apply these high-level scenarios to a rich
simulation model of the system to generate detailed scenarios and identify the
probability and consequences of these scenarios. SIMPRA has three main modules
including Simulator, Planner and Scheduler, and it approach is much more
efficient in covering the large space of possible scenarios as compared with,
for example, biased Monte Carlo simulations because of the Planner module which
uses engineering knowledge to guide the simulation process. The value-added of
this approach is that it enables the designer to observe system behaviour under
many different conditions. This process will lead to a risk-informed design in
which the risk of negative consequences is either eliminated entirely or
reduced to an acceptable range. For illustrative purposes, an earth observation
satellite system example is introduced.

increasingly more concrete forms, drawing on a variety of approaches and
instruments from hard regulation to standardisation efforts, aimed at
mitigating challenges from high-risk AI systems. To implement these and other
efforts, new institutions will need to be established on a national and
international level. This paper sketches a blueprint of such institutions, and
conducts in-depth investigations of three key components of any future AI
governance institutions, exploring benefits and associated drawbacks: (1)
purpose, relating to the institution's overall goals and scope of work or
mandate; (2) geography, relating to questions of participation and the reach of
jurisdiction; and (3) capacity, the infrastructural and human make-up of the
institution. Subsequently, the paper highlights noteworthy aspects of various
institutional roles specifically around questions of institutional purpose, and
frames what these could look like in practice, by placing these debates in a
European context and proposing different iterations of a European AI Agency.
Finally, conclusions and future research directions are proposed.

which allows for a deeper understanding of adiabatic energy changes that occur
during charged particle transport, as well as of their significance for
simulation approaches. Thereby we seek to further validate an improved approach
to estimate residence times numerically by investigating the implications on
previous analytical approaches, and possible effects detectable by spacecraft
data. Utilizing a propagation model based on a Stochastic Differential Equation
(SDE) solver written in CUDA, residence times for Jovian electrons are
calculated over the whole energy range dominated by the Jovian electron source
spectrum. We analyse the interdependences both with the magnetic connection
between observer and the source as well as between the the distribution of the
exit (simulation) times and the resulting residence times. We point out a
linear relation between the residence time for different kinetic energies and
the longitudinal shift of the 13 month periodicity typically observed for
Jovian electrons and discuss the applicability of these findings to data.
Furthermore, we utilize our finding that the simulated residence times are
approximately linearly related to the energy loss for Jovian and Galactic
electrons, and develop an improved analytical estimation in agreement with the
numerical residence time and the longitudinal shift observed by measurements.

sub-orbital or escape velocity objects with an orbiting object of satellites
occur when two satellites collide while orbiting the earth. One of the
approaches to avoid collisions is a robotic configuration of satellite
constellations. Satellite constellations should not be confused with satellite
clusters, which are groups of satellites moving in close proximity to each
other in nearly identical orbits; nor with satellite series or satellite
programs, which are generations of satellites launched successively; nor with
satellite fleets, which are groups of satellites from the same manufacturer or
operator that operate an independent system. CfEOS constellations designed for
geospatial applications and Earth observation. Unlike a single satellite, a
constellation can provide permanent global or near-global coverage anywhere on
Earth. CfEOS constellations are configured in sets of complementary orbital
planes and connect to ground stations located around the globe. This paper
describes the GNC analysis, the orbit propagation and robotic systems

  the biomedical domain","Abstract shortened to comply with arXiv guidelines","BMC Bioinformatics (2019)","10.1186/s12859-019-2789-2",,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the efficacy of current
state-of-the-art neural sentence embedding models for semantic similarity
estimation of sentences from biomedical literature. We trained different neural
embedding models on 1.7 million articles from the PubMed Open Access dataset,
and evaluated them based on a biomedical benchmark set containing 100 sentence
pairs annotated by human experts and a smaller contradiction subset derived
from the original benchmark set.
  RESULTS: With a Pearson correlation of 0.819, our best unsupervised model
based on the Paragraph Vector Distributed Memory algorithm outperforms previous
state-of-the-art results achieved on the BIOSSES biomedical benchmark set.
Moreover, our proposed supervised model that combines different string-based
similarity metrics with a neural embedding model surpasses previous
ontology-dependent supervised state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Pearson's
r (r=0.871) on the biomedical benchmark set. In contrast to the promising
results for the original benchmark, we found our best models' performance on
the smaller contradiction subset to be poor.
  CONCLUSIONS: In this study we highlighted the value of neural network-based
models for semantic similarity estimation in the biomedical domain by showing
that they can keep up with and even surpass previous state-of-the-art
approaches for semantic similarity estimation that depend on the availability
of laboriously curated ontologies when evaluated on a biomedical benchmark set.
Capturing contradictions and negations in biomedical sentences, however,
emerged as an essential area for further work.

consumption behaviors. Seasonal variation in consumption is not well understood
but yet important to utilities for energy pricing and services. This paper aims
to develop a methodology to measure seasonal variations in load patterns and
identify the relationship between seasonal variation and socioeconomic factors,
as socioeconomic characteristics often have great explanatory power on
electricity consumption behaviors. We first model the seasonal load patterns
using a two-stage K-Medoids clustering and evaluate the relative entropy of the
load pattern distributions between seasons. Then we develop decision tree
classifiers for each season to analyze the importance of different
socioeconomic characteristics factors. Taking real-world data as a case study,
we find that income level is an essential factor influencing the pattern
variation across all seasons. The number of children and the elderly is also a
significant factor for certain seasonal changes.
