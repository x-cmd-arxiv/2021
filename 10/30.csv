data after deployment on memory-constrained edge devices. Previous work is
mostly concerned with reducing the number of model parameters which is only
beneficial for inference. However, memory footprint from activations is the
main bottleneck for training on the edge. Existing incremental training methods
fine-tune the last few layers sacrificing accuracy gains from re-training the
whole model. In this work, we investigate the memory footprint of training deep
learning models, and use our observations to propose BitTrain. In BitTrain, we
exploit activation sparsity and propose a novel bitmap compression technique
that reduces the memory footprint during training. We save the activations in
our proposed bitmap compression format during the forward pass of the training,
and restore them during the backward pass for the optimizer computations. The
proposed method can be integrated seamlessly in the computation graph of modern
deep learning frameworks. Our implementation is safe by construction, and has
no negative impact on the accuracy of model training. Experimental results show
up to 34% reduction in the memory footprint at a sparsity level of 50%. Further
pruning during training results in more than 70% sparsity, which can lead to up
to 56% reduction in memory footprint. BitTrain advances the efforts towards
bringing more machine learning capabilities to edge devices. Our source code is

molecular hydrogen in the CH$_4$ reaction network. We make use of an ultra-high
vacuum cryogenic setup combining an atomic carbon atom beam and both atomic
and/or molecular beams of hydrogen and deuterium on a H$_2$O ice. These
experiments lead to the formation of methane isotopologues detected in situ
through reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy. Most notably, CH$_4$ is
formed in an experiment combining C atoms with H$_2$ on amorphous solid water,
albeit slower than in experiments with H atoms present. Furthermore,
CH$_2$D$_2$ is detected in an experiment of C atoms with H$_2$ and D$_2$ on

compute an invariant circle for 2-dimensional maps along with the corresponding

initial guess that satisfies the invariance equation very approximately
(depending on some condition numbers, evaluated on the approximate solution),
then the algorithm converges to a true solution which is close to the initial
guess. The convergence is faster than exponential in smooth norms. The distance
from the exact solution and the approximation is bounded by the initial error.
This allows validating the numerical approximations (a-posteriori results). It
also implies the usual persistence formulations since the exact solutions of
the invariance equation for a model are approximate solutions for a similar
model. The algorithm we present works irrespective of whether the dynamics on
the invariant circle is a rotation or it is phase-locked. The condition numbers
required do not involve any global qualitative properties of the map. They are
obtained by evaluating derivatives of the initial guess, derivatives of the map
in a neighborhood of the guess, performing algebraic operations, and taking
suprema. The proof of the convergence is based on a general Nash-Moser implicit
function theorem specially tailored for this problem. The Nash-Moser procedure
has unusual properties. As it turns out, the regularity requirements are not
very severe (only 2 derivatives suffice). We hope that this implicit function
theorem may be of independent interest and have presented it in a

currently done using Deep Learning with GPU accelerators. The principal
challenge of such technique is that a single input can easily cope computing
resources, and require prohibitive amounts of time to be processed.
Distribution of deep learning and scalability over computing devices is an
actual need for progressing on such research field. Conventional distribution
of neural networks consist in data parallelism, where data is scattered over
resources (e.g., GPUs) to parallelize the training of the model. However,
experiment parallelism is also an option, where different training processes
are parallelized across resources. While the first option is much more common
on 3D image segmentation, the second provides a pipeline design with less
dependence among parallelized processes, allowing overhead reduction and more
potential scalability. In this work we present a design for distributed deep
learning training pipelines, focusing on multi-node and multi-GPU environments,
where the two different distribution approaches are deployed and benchmarked.
We take as proof of concept the 3D U-Net architecture, using the MSD Brain
Tumor Segmentation dataset, a state-of-art problem in medical image
segmentation with high computing and space requirements. Using the BSC
MareNostrum supercomputer as benchmarking environment, we use TensorFlow and
Ray as neural network training and experiment distribution platforms. We
evaluate the experiment speed-up, showing the potential for scaling out on GPUs
and nodes. Also comparing the different parallelism techniques, showing how
experiment distribution leverages better such resources through scaling.
Finally, we provide the implementation of the design open to the community, and
the non-trivial steps and methodology for adapting and deploying a MIS case as

sparsification of Nagamochi and Ibaraki [Algorithmica, 1992], which is an
algorithm that, given an unweighted graph $G$ on $n$ nodes and a parameter $k$,
computes a subgraph with $O(nk)$ edges that preserves all cuts of value up to
$k$. We put forward the notion of a friendly cut sparsifier, which is a minor
of $G$ that preserves all friendly cuts of value up to $k$, where a cut in $G$
is called friendly if every node has more edges connecting it to its own side
of the cut than to the other side. We present an algorithm that, given a simple
graph $G$, computes in almost-linear time a friendly cut sparsifier with
$\tilde{O}(n \sqrt{k})$ edges. Using similar techniques, we also show how,
given in addition a terminal set $T$, one can compute in almost-linear time a
terminal sparsifier, which preserves the minimum $st$-cut between every pair of
terminals, with $\tilde{O}(n \sqrt{k} + |T| k)$ edges.
  Plugging these sparsifiers into the recent $n^{2+o(1)}$-time algorithms for
constructing a Gomory-Hu tree of simple graphs, along with a relatively simple
procedure for handling the unfriendly minimum cuts, we improve the running time
for moderately dense graphs (e.g., with $m=n^{1.75}$ edges). In particular,
assuming a linear-time Max-Flow algorithm, the new state-of-the-art for
Gomory-Hu tree is the minimum between our $(m+n^{1.75})^{1+o(1)}$ and the known
$m n^{1/2+o(1)}$.
  We further investigate the limits of this approach and the possibility of
better sparsification. Under the hypothesis that an $\tilde{O}(n)$-edge
sparsifier that preserves all friendly minimum $st$-cuts can be computed
efficiently, our upper bound improves to $\tilde{O}(m+n^{1.5})$ which is the
best possible without breaking the cubic barrier for constructing Gomory-Hu
trees in non-simple graphs.

radiation. We explore the gradual Fe enrichment of wind-driving silicate grains
in M-type AGB stars to derive typical values for Fe/Mg and test the effects on
wind properties and synthetic spectra. We present new DARWIN models that allow
for the growth of silicate grains with a variable Fe/Mg ratio and predict
mass-loss rates, wind velocities, and grain properties. Synthetic spectra and
other observables are computed with the COMA code. The self-regulating feedback
between grain composition and radiative heating, in combination with quickly
falling densities in the stellar wind, leads to low values of Fe/Mg, typically
a few percent. Nevertheless, the models show distinct silicate features around
10 and 18 microns. Fe enrichment affects visual and near-IR photometry
moderately, and the new DARWIN models agree well with observations in (J-K) vs.
(V-K) and Spitzer color-color diagrams. The enrichment of the silicate dust
with Fe is a secondary process, taking place in the stellar wind on the surface
of large Fe-free grains that have initiated the outflow. Therefore, the
mass-loss rates are basically unaffected, while the wind velocities tend to be
slightly higher than in corresponding models with Fe-free silicate dust. The
gradual Fe enrichment of silicate grains in the inner wind region should
produce signatures observable in mid-IR spectro-interferometrical measurements.
Mass-loss rates derived from existing DARWIN models, based on Fe-free
silicates, can be applied to stellar evolution models since the mass-loss rates
are not significantly affected by the inclusion of Fe in the silicate grains.

anticipate all situations that an autonomous system may face or what behavior

overcome this challenge by discovering for itself when and how to behave
cautiously. In contrast, current approaches typically embed task-specific
safety information or explicit cautious behaviors into the system, which is
error-prone and imposes extra burdens on practitioners. In this paper, we
present both a sequence of tasks where cautious behavior becomes increasingly

are that it characterizes reward function uncertainty without task-specific
safety information and uses this uncertainty to construct a robust policy.
Specifically, we construct robust policies with a $k$-of-$N$ counterfactual

uncertainty represented by a neural network ensemble belief. These policies
exhibit caution in each of our tasks without any task-specific safety tuning.

Frobenius forms, a class of homogenous polynomials in prime characteristic
recently shown to have minimal possible F-pure threshold among forms of the
same degree. We call these surfaces $\textit{extremal surfaces}$, and show that
their geometry is reminiscent of the geometry of smooth cubic surfaces,
especially non-Frobenius split cubic surfaces of characteristic two, which are
examples of extremal surfaces. For example, we show that an extremal surface
$X$ contains $d^2(d^2-3d+3)$ lines where $d$ is the degree, which is notable
since the number of lines on a complex surface is bounded above by a quadratic
function in $d$. Whenever two of those lines meet, they determine a $d$-tangent
plane to $X$ which consists of a union of $d$ lines meeting in one point; we
count the precise number of such ""star points"" on $X$, showing that it is
quintic in the degree, which recovers the fact that there are exactly 45
Eckardt points on an extremal cubic surface.
  Finally, we generalize the classical notion of a double six for cubic
surfaces to a double $2d$ on an extremal surface of degree $d$. We show that,
asymptotically in $d$, smooth extremal surfaces have at least
$\frac{1}{16}d^{14}$ double $2d$'s. A key element of the proofs is using the
large automorphism group of extremal surfaces which we show acts transitively
on many sets, such as the set of (triples of skew) lines on the extremal

methods have been widely applied to this problem and validated mostly in
simulation; there are, however, few studies on a direct comparison of different
models or validation in real buildings to be found in the literature. Methods
that are indeed validated in application often lead to computationally complex
non-convex optimization problems. Here we compare physics-informed
Autoregressive-Moving-Average with Exogenous Inputs (ARMAX) models to Machine
Learning models based on Random Forests and Input Convex Neural Networks and
the resulting convex MPC schemes in experiments on a practical building
application with the goal of minimizing energy consumption while maintaining
occupant comfort, and in a numerical case study. We demonstrate that Predictive
Control in general leads to savings between 26% and 49% of heating and cooling

show that all model types lead to satisfactory control performance in terms of
constraint satisfaction and energy reduction. However, we also see that the
physics-informed ARMAX models have a lower computational burden, and a superior
sample efficiency compared to the Machine Learning based models. Moreover, even
if abundant training data is available, the ARMAX models have a significantly
lower prediction error than the Machine Learning models, which indicates that

thousands of people each year, has been attributed to increased human
population, migration, and environmental changes. Convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have been used by several studies to recognise mosquitoes in images
provided by projects such as Mosquito Alert to assist entomologists in
identifying, monitoring, and managing MBD. Nonetheless, utilising CNNs to
automatically label input samples could involve incorrect predictions, which
may mislead future epidemiological studies. Furthermore, CNNs require large
numbers of manually annotated data. In order to address the mentioned issues,
this paper proposes using the Monte Carlo Dropout method to estimate the
uncertainty scores in order to rank the classified samples to reduce the need
for human supervision in recognising Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The estimated
uncertainty was also used in an active learning framework, where just a portion
of the data from large training sets was manually labelled. The experimental
results show that the proposed classification method with rejection outperforms
the competing methods by improving overall performance and reducing
entomologist annotation workload. We also provide explainable visualisations of
the different regions that contribute to a set of samples' uncertainty
assessment.

one of the most outstanding problems in generative models. In this work, we
propose a novel activation function to be used as output of the generator

transformation and it is specifically designed to improve the quality of the
generated data. In sharp contrast with previous works, our activation function
provides a more general approach that deals not only with the replication of
categorical variables but with any type of data distribution (continuous or
discrete). Moreover, our activation function is derivable and therefore, it can
be seamlessly integrated in the backpropagation computations during the GAN
training processes. To validate this approach, we evaluate our proposal against
two different data sets: a) an artificially rendered data set containing a
mixture of discrete and continuous variables, and b) a real data set of
flow-based network traffic data containing both normal connections and
cryptomining attacks. To evaluate the fidelity of the generated data, we
analyze both their results in terms of quality measures of statistical nature
and also regarding the use of these synthetic data to feed a nested machine
learning-based classifier. The experimental results evince a clear
outperformance of the GAN network tuned with this new activation function with
respect to both a na\""ive mean-based generator and a standard GAN. The quality
of the data is so high that the generated data can fully substitute real data
for training the nested classifier without a fall in the obtained accuracy.
This result encourages the use of GANs to produce high-quality synthetic data
that are applicable in scenarios in which data privacy must be guaranteed.

remnant black holes, studying strong gravity, and testing GR. Only recently
have QNM studies begun to focus on multimode fitting to numerical relativity
(NR) strain waveforms. As GW observatories become even more sensitive they will
be able to resolve higher-order modes. Consequently, multimode QNM fits will be
critically important, and in turn require a more thorough treatment of the
asymptotic frame at $\mathscr{I}^+$. The first main result of this work is a
method for systematically fitting a QNM model containing many modes to a
numerical waveform produced using Cauchy-characteristic extraction (CCE), an
extraction technique which is known to resolve memory effects. We choose the
modes to model based on their power contribution to the residual between
numerical and model waveforms. We show that the all-mode strain mismatch
improves by a factor of $\sim10^5$ when using multimode fitting as opposed to
only fitting the $(2,\pm2,n)$ modes. Our most significant result addresses a
critical point that has been overlooked in the QNM literature: the importance
of matching the Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame of the numerical
waveform to that of the QNM model. We show that by mapping the numerical
waveforms$-$which exhibit the memory effect$-$to a BMS frame known as the super
rest frame, there is an improvement of $\sim10^5$ in the all-mode strain
mismatch compared to using a strain waveform whose BMS frame is not fixed.
Furthermore, we find that by mapping CCE waveforms to the super rest frame, we
can obtain all-mode mismatches that are, on average, a factor of $\sim4$ better
than using the publicly-available extrapolated waveforms. We illustrate the
effectiveness of these modeling enhancements by applying them to families of
waveforms produced by NR and comparing our results to previous QNM studies.

address this challenge, we need to better understand how the reactor core
responds to seismic forcing. The reactor core is made of fuel assemblies, which
are themselves composed of flexible fuel rods immersed in a strong axial flow.
This gives rise to strongly-coupled fluid-structure interactions whose accurate
modelling generally requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
introduce a new model able to capture the mechanical response of the reactor
core subjected to seismic forcing with low computational costs. This model is
based on potential flow theory for the fluid part and Euler-Bernoulli beam
theory for the structural part allowing us to predict the response to seismic
forcing in presence of axial flow.. The linear equations are solved in the
Fourier space to decrease computational time. For validation purposes, we first
use the proposed model to compute the response of a single cylinder in axial
flow. We then implement a multiple cylinder geometry made of 4 fuel assemblies,
each made of 8x8 cylinders, corresponding to an experimental facility available
at CEA. The comparison between numerical results and experiments show good
agreement. The model can correctly predict the added mass. It can also
qualitatively capture the coupling between assemblies and the effect of
confinement. This shows that a potential flow approach can give insight into
the complex fluid-structure interactions within a nuclear reactor and, in
particular, be used to predict the response to seismic forcing at low
computational cost.

by the solar wind turbulence in the region from the Sun up to the heliospheric
termination shock, where they can also experience the shock-drift acceleration
or the reflection from the cross-shock potential. These processes create a
high-energy ""tail"" in the pickup ion energy distribution. The properties of
this energetic pickup proton population are still not well-defined, despite
they are vital for the models to simulate energetic neutral atom fluxes. We
have considered two scenarios for pickup proton velocity distribution
downstream of the heliospheric termination shock (filled shell with energetic
power-law ""tail"" and bi-Maxwellian). Based on the numerical kinetic model and
observations of the energetic neutral atom fluxes from the inner heliosheath by
the IBEX-Hi instrument, we have characterized the pickup proton distribution
and provided estimations on the properties of the energetic pickup proton
population downstream of the termination shock.

but also inducts more accurate unlabeled constituency trees than all previous
unsupervised methods with simpler rules. With two frameworks for labeled
constituency trees inference, we set both the new state-of-the-art for

standard mechanism allowing quantum many-body systems to escape ergodicity.
This idea acquired even more prominence in the last decade as it has been
argued that localisation -- dubbed many-body localisation (MBL) in this context
-- can sometimes survive local interactions in the presence of sufficiently
strong disorder. A conventional signature of localisation is in the statistical
properties of the spectrum -- spectral statistics -- which differ qualitatively
from those in the ergodic phase. Although features of the spectral statistics
are routinely used as numerical diagnostics for localisation, they have never
been derived from first principles in the presence of non-trivial interactions.
Here we fill this gap and provide the example of a simple class of quantum
many-body systems -- which we dub strongly localised quantum circuits -- that
are interacting, localised, and where the spectral statistics can be
characterised exactly. Furthermore, we show that these systems exhibit a
cascade of three different regimes for spectral correlations depending on the
energy scale: at small, intermediate, and large scales they behave as
disconnected patches of three decreasing sizes. We argue that these features
appear in generic MBL systems, with the difference that only at the smallest
scale they do become Poissonian.

calculate transient acoustic fields of arbitrary-shape transducers. It involves
the evaluation of a time-dependent surface integral. Although analytic
expressions of the SIR exist for some geometries, numerical methods based on
the discretization of transducer surfaces have become the standard. The
proposed method consists of representing the transducer as a non-uniform
rational B-spline (NURBS) surface, and decomposing it into smooth B\'ezier
patches onto which quadrature rules can be deployed. The evaluation of the SIR
can then be expressed in B-spline bases, resulting in a sum of
shifted-and-weighted basis functions. Field signals are eventually obtained by
a convolution of the basis coefficients, derived from the excitation waveform,
and the basis SIR. The use of NURBS enables exact representations of common
transducer elements. High-order Gaussian quadrature rules enable high accuracy
with few quadrature points. High-order B-spline bases are ideally suited to
exploit efficiently the bandlimited property of excitation waveforms. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach enables sampling the SIR at
low sampling rates, as required by the excitation waveform, without introducing

particular infinite-width scaling, where the learning dynamics is closely
tracked by the MF limit. A random fluctuation around this infinite-width limit
is expected from a large-width expansion to the next order. This fluctuation
has been studied only in shallow networks, where previous works employ heavily
technical notions or additional formulation ideas amenable only to that case.
Treatment of the multilayer case has been missing, with the chief difficulty in
finding a formulation that captures the stochastic dependency across not only
time but also depth.
  In this work, we initiate the study of the fluctuation in the case of
multilayer networks, at any network depth. Leveraging on the neuronal embedding
framework recently introduced by Nguyen and Pham, we systematically derive a
system of dynamical equations, called the second-order MF limit, that captures
the limiting fluctuation distribution. We demonstrate through the framework the
complex interaction among neurons in this second-order MF limit, the
stochasticity with cross-layer dependency and the nonlinear time evolution
inherent in the limiting fluctuation. A limit theorem is proven to relate
quantitatively this limit to the fluctuation of large-width networks.
  We apply the result to show a stability property of gradient descent MF
training: in the large-width regime, along the training trajectory, it
progressively biases towards a solution with ""minimal fluctuation"" (in fact,
vanishing fluctuation) in the learned output function, even after the network
has been initialized at or has converged (sufficiently fast) to a global
optimum. This extends a similar phenomenon previously shown only for shallow
networks with a squared loss in the ERM setting, to multilayer networks with a
loss function that is not necessarily convex in a more general setting.

non-thermal' synchrotron model and derive properties of the resulting spectrum
and light-curves. Using these results we delineate the relative importance of
thermal and non-thermal electrons for sub-relativistic shock-powered
synchrotron transients. We find that thermal electrons are naturally expected
to contribute significantly to the peak emission if the shock velocity is
$\gtrsim 0.2c$, but would be mostly undetectable in non-relativistic shocks.
This helps explain the dichotomy between typical radio supernovae and the
emerging class of `AT2018cow-like' events. The signpost of thermal electron
synchrotron emission is a steep optically-thin spectral index and a $\nu^2$
optically-thick spectrum. These spectral features are also predicted to
correlate with a steep post-peak light-curve decline rate, broadly consistent
with observed AT2018cow-like events. We expect that thermal electrons may be
observable in other contexts where mildly-relativistic shocks are present, and
briefly estimate this effect for gamma-ray burst afterglows and binary neutron
star mergers. Our model can be used to fit spectra and light-curves of events

the difference between the locally measured Hubble constant $H_0$ and the value
inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Interacting radiation has
been suggested as a solution, but studies show that conventional models are
precluded by high-$\ell$ CMB polarization data. It seems at least plausible
that a solution may be provided by related models that distinguish between
high- and low-$\ell$ multipoles. When interactions of strongly-coupled
radiation are mediated by a force-carrier that becomes non-relativistic, the
dark radiation undergoes a ""step"" in which its relative energy density
increases as the mediator deposits its entropy into the lighter species. If
this transition occurs while CMB-observable modes are inside the horizon, high-
and low-$\ell$ peaks are impacted differently, corresponding to modes that
enter the horizon before or after the step. These dynamics are naturally
packaged into the simplest supersymmetric theory, the Wess-Zumino model, with
the mass of the scalar mediator near the eV-scale. We investigate the
cosmological signatures of such ""Wess-Zumino Dark Radiation"" (WZDR) and find
that it provides an improved fit to the CMB alone, favoring larger values of
$H_0$. If supernovae measurements from the SH0ES collaboration are also
included in the analysis, the inferred value of $H_0$ is yet larger, but the
preference for dark radiation and the location of the transition is left nearly
unchanged. Utilizing a standardized set of measures, we compare to other models
and find that WZDR is among the most successful at addressing the $H_0$ tension

to the Lyman-alpha forest in the spectra of distant quasars encodes information
on the physics of structure formation and the early thermodynamics of diffuse
baryonic material. Here, we use a massive suite of more than 400
high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations run with the Graphics
Processing Unit-accelerated code Cholla to study the IGM at high spatial
resolution maintained over the entire computational volume. The simulations
capture a wide range of possible thermal histories of intergalactic gas by
varying the amplitude and timing of the photoheating and photoionizing
background produced by star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei. A
statistical comparison of synthetic spectra with the observed 1D flux power
spectra of hydrogen in 14 redshift bins over the full range 2.2 <= z <= 5.0 and
with the Lyman-alpha opacity of helium in 5 redshift bins over the range 2.4 <
z < 2.9 tightly constrains the photoionization and photoheating history of the
IGM. By leveraging the constraining power of the available Lyman-alpha forest
data to break model degeneracies, we find that the IGM experienced two main
reheating events from the non-equilibrium ionization of hydrogen and helium
over 1.2 Gyr of cosmic time. For our best-fit model, hydrogen reionization
completes by z~6.0 with a first IGM temperature peak T_0 ~ 1.3x10^4 K, and is
followed by the reionization of HeII that completes by z~3.0 and yields a
second temperature peak of T_0 ~ 1.4x10^4 K. We discuss how our results can be

QCD processes. The primary Lund jet plane density is a two-dimensional visual
representation of the radiation off the primary emitter within the jet that can
be used to isolate different regions of the QCD phase space. A new measurement
of the primary Lund plane density for inclusive charged-particle jets in the
transverse momentum range of 20 and 120 GeV/$c$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =
$ 13 TeV with the ALICE detector will be presented. This is the first
measurement of the Lund plane density in an intermediate jet $p_{\rm T}$ range
where hadronization and underlying event effects play a dominant role. The
projections of the Lund plane density onto the splitting scale $k_{\rm T}$ and
splitting angle $\Delta{R}$ axis are shown, highlighting the
perturbative/non-perturbative and wide/narrow angle regions of the splitting
phase space. Through a 3D unfolding procedure, the Lund plane density is
corrected for detector effects which allows for quantitative comparisons to MC
generators to provide insight into how well generators describe different

three-dimensional simulations of 9 M$_{\odot}$ progenitors, one rotating with
an initial spin period of $\sim$60 seconds and the other non-rotating. We
determine that both models explode early, though the rotating model explodes a
bit earlier. Despite this difference, the asymptotic explosion energies
($\sim$10$^{50}$ ergs) and residual neutron star baryon masses ($\sim$1.3
M$_{\odot}$) are similar. We find that the proto-neutron star (PNS) core can
deleptonize and cool significantly more quickly. Soon into the evolution of the
rotating model, we witness more vigorous and extended PNS core convection that
early in its evolution envelopes the entire inner sphere, not just a shell.
Moreover, we see a corresponding excursion in both the $\nu_e$ luminosity and
gravitational-wave strain that may be diagnostic of this observed dramatic
phenomenon. In addition, after bounce the innermost region of the rotating
model seems to execute meridional circulation. The rotationally-induced growth
of the convective PNS region may facilitate the growth of core B-fields by the
dynamo mechanism by facilitating the achievement of the critical Rossby number
condition for substantial growth of a dipole field, obviating the need for
rapid rotation rates to create dipole fields of significance. The next step is
to explore the progenitor-mass and spin dependencies across the progenitor
continuum of the supernova explosion, dynamics, and evolution of PNS convection
and its potential role in the generation of magnetar and pulsar magnetic
fields.

simulations permit a habitable climate as late as ~0.7 Ga, and there is
suggestive-albeit inconclusive-evidence for previous liquid water from surface
geomorphology and mineralogy. However, it is unclear whether a habitable past
can be reconciled with Venus's inferred atmospheric evolution. In particular,
the lack of leftover atmospheric oxygen argues against recent water loss. Here,
we apply a fully coupled model of Venus's atmospheric-interior-climate
evolution from post-accretion magma ocean to present. The model
self-consistently tracks C-, H-, and O-bearing volatiles and surface climate
through the entirety of Venus's history. Atmospheric escape, mantle convection,
melt production, outgassing, deep water cycling, and carbon cycling are
explicitly coupled to climate and redox evolution. Plate tectonic and stagnant
lid histories are considered. Using this coupled model, we conclude that both a
habitable Venusian past and one where Venus never possessed liquid surface
water can be reconciled with known constraints. Specifically, either scenario
can reproduce bulk atmospheric composition, inferred surface heat flow, and
observed $^{40}$Ar and $^{4}$He. Moreover, the model suggests that Venus could
have been habitable with a ~100 m global ocean as late as 1 Ga, without
violating any known constraints. In fact, if diffusion-limited water loss is
throttled by a cool, CO$_2$-dominated upper atmosphere, then a habitable past
is tentatively favored by our model. This escape throttling makes it difficult
to simultaneously recover negligible water vapor and ~90 bar CO$_2$ in the
modern atmosphere without temporarily sequestering carbon in the interior via
silicate weathering to enhance H escape.

contribution in the early phase of training, and then evolves in overall scale,
yielding a function equivalent to a kernel regression solution with the final

the depth. We also demonstrate that non-whitened data can weaken the silent

anomalous transient light curves in real-time. Both methods are based on the
simple idea that if the light curves from a known population of transients can
be accurately modelled, any deviations from model predictions are likely
anomalies. The first modelling approach is a probabilistic neural network built
using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) and the second is an interpretable
Bayesian parametric model of a transient. We demonstrate our methods' ability
to provide anomaly scores as a function of time on light curves from the Zwicky
Transient Facility. We show that the flexibility of neural networks, the
attribute that makes them such a powerful tool for many regression tasks, is
what makes them less suitable for anomaly detection when compared with our
parametric model. The parametric model is able to identify anomalies with
respect to common supernova classes with high precision and recall scores,
achieving area under the precision-recall curves (AUCPR) above 0.79 for most
rare classes such as kilonovae, tidal disruption events, intermediate

for the prediction of the biological effectiveness of nanoparticle
radiosensitization. Approach: An extended local effects model is first proposed
with a more comprehensive description of the nanoparticles mediated local
killing enhancements, but meanwhile puts forward challenging issues that remain
difficult and need to be further studied. As a novel method instead of local
effect modeling, a survival modification framework of compound Poisson additive
killing is proposed, as the consequence of an independent additive killing by
the assumed equivalent uniform doses of individual nanoparticles per cell under
the LQ model. A compound Poisson killing (CPK)model based on the framework is
thus derived, giving a general expression of nanoparticle mediated LQ parameter
modification. For practical use, a simplified form of the model is also
derived, as a concentration dependent correction only to the {\alpha}
parameter, with the relative correction (alpha""/alpha)) dominated by the mean
number, and affected by the agglomeration of nanoparticles per cell. For
different agglomeration state, a monodispersion model of the dispersity factor
{\eta}=1, and an agglomeration model of 2/3<{\eta}<1,are provided for practical
prediction of (alpha""/alpha) value respectively. Main results: Initial
validation by the radiosensitization ofHepG2 cells by carbon dots showed a high

  results relaxing compactness assumptions",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The framework of optimal transport has been leveraged to extend the notion of
rank to the multivariate setting while preserving desirable properties of the
resulting goodness-of-fit (GoF) statistics. In particular, the rank energy (RE)
and rank maximum mean discrepancy (RMMD) are distribution-free under the null,
exhibit high power in statistical testing, and are robust to outliers. In this
paper, we point to and alleviate some of the practical shortcomings of these
proposed GoF statistics, namely their high computational cost, high statistical
sample complexity, and lack of differentiability with respect to the data. We
show that all these practically important issues are addressed by considering
entropy-regularized optimal transport maps in place of the rank map, which we
refer to as the soft rank. We consequently propose two new statistics, the soft
rank energy (sRE) and soft rank maximum mean discrepancy (sRMMD), which exhibit
several desirable properties. Given $n$ sample data points, we provide
non-asymptotic convergence rates for the sample estimate of the entropic
transport map to its population version that are essentially of the order
$n^{-1/2}$ when the starting measure is subgaussian and the target measure has
compact support. This result is novel compared to existing results which
achieve a rate of $n^{-1}$ but crucially rely on both measures having compact
support. We leverage this result to demonstrate fast convergence of sample sRE
and sRMMD to their population version making them useful for high-dimensional
GoF testing. Our statistics are differentiable and amenable to popular machine
learning frameworks that rely on gradient methods. We leverage these properties
towards showcasing the utility of the proposed statistics for generative
modeling on two important problems: image generation and generating valid
knockoffs for controlled feature selection.

60 resolved red giant branch stars as faint as $m_{F475W}\sim24$ mag, a factor
of $\sim4$x more stars than current spectroscopic MDF determinations. We find

dispersion of $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.42^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, which are
consistent with spectroscopic MDFs, though more precisely constrained owing to
a larger sample. We identify a handful of extremely metal-poor star candidates
(EMP; [Fe/H] $< -3$) that are marginally bright enough for spectroscopic follow
up. Eri II's MDF appears well-described by a leaky box chemical evolution
model. We also compute an updated orbital history for Eri II using Gaia eDR3
proper motions, and find that it is likely on first infall into the Milky Way.
Our findings suggest that Eri II underwent an evolutionary history similar to
that of an isolated galaxy. Compared to MDFs for select cosmological
simulations of similar mass galaxies, we find that Eri II has a lower fraction
of stars with [Fe/H] $< -3$, though such comparisons should currently be
treated with caution due to a paucity of simulations, selection effects, and
known limitations of Ca H&K for EMPs. This study demonstrates the power of deep
HST CaHK imaging for measuring the MDFs of UFDs.

wavelength range of the spectral energy distribution (SED) fits and by using
more recent population synthesis models. The rationale for this experiment is
to verify the sensitivity of the clusters' physical parameters to observational
setups and model choices that span those commonly found in the literature. We
derive the physical parameters of 137 clusters, using SEDs measured in eight
UV-to-I bands, including H-alpha, from GALEX and ground-based images. We also
add the 24 micron image from the Spitzer Space Telescope to help break some age
degeneracies. We find that our derived cluster ages show significant
differences with earlier determinations, while the masses remain relatively
insensitive to the fitting approach adopted. We also highlight an already known
difficulty in recovering old, low-extinction clusters, as SED fitting codes
tend to prefer younger, higher extinction solutions when the extinction is a
free parameter. We publish updated ages, masses, and extinctions, with
uncertainties, for all sample star clusters, together with their photometry;
given the proximity of M33, this represents an important population to secure

three-dimensional growth during nucleation. Here, we present a route towards
sub-nanometer thin and continuous aluminum oxide (AlOx) coatings on silicon

interface energetics. We use trimethylaluminum (TMA) in combination with remote

with the surface oxide (SiO2) on silicon until there is a saturation of
bindings sites, after which the oxygen from the underlying surface oxide is
consumed, thereby transforming the silicon oxide into Si capped with AlOx.
Depending on the number of ALD cycles, the SiO2 can be partially or fully
transformed, which we exploit to create sub-nanometer thin and continuous AlOx
layers deposited in selected regions defined by lithographic patterning. The
resulting patterned surfaces are characterized by lateral AlOx/SiO2 interfaces
possessing step heights as small as 0.3 nm and surface potential steps in
excess of 0.4 V. In addition, the introduction of fixed negative charges of $9

Generalized Data Weighting (GDW) to simultaneously mitigate label noise and

GDW unrolls the loss gradient to class-level gradients by the chain rule and
reweights the flow of each gradient separately. In this way, GDW achieves
remarkable performance improvement on both issues. Aside from the performance
gain, GDW efficiently obtains class-level weights without introducing any extra

information due to extraordinary events, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.
For these reasons, it is very common nowadays to use some non-traditional data

common. The migration model proposes that super-Earths migrate inwards and pile
up at the disk inner edge in chains of mean motion resonances. After gas disk
dispersal, simulations show that super-Earth's gravitational interactions can
naturally break their resonant configuration leading to a late phase of giant
impacts. The instability phase is key to matching the orbital spacing of
observed systems. Yet, most previous simulations have modelled collisions as
perfect accretion events, ignoring fragmentation. In this work, we investigate
the impact of imperfect accretion on the breaking the chains scenario. We
performed N-body simulations starting from distributions of planetary embryos
and modelling the effects of pebble accretion and migration in the gas disk.
Our simulations also follow the long-term dynamical evolution of super-Earths
after the gas disk dissipation. We compared the results of simulations where
collisions are treated as perfect merging events with those where imperfect
accretion and fragmentation are allowed. We concluded that the perfect
accretion is a suitable approximation in this regime, from a dynamical point of
view. Although fragmentation events are common, only ~10% of the system mass is
fragmented during a typical ""late instability phase"", with fragments being
mostly reacreted by surviving planets. This limited total mass in fragments
proved to be insufficient to alter qualitatively the final system dynamical
configuration -- e.g. promote strong dynamical friction or residual migration
-- compared to simulations where fragmentation is neglected.

temporal frequency of sampling. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to
obtain spatio-temporal super-resolution in neuronal time series by exploiting
relationships among neurons, embedded in latent low-dimensional population
dynamics. Our novel neural network training strategy, selective backpropagation
through time (SBTT), enables learning of deep generative models of latent
dynamics from data in which the set of observed variables changes at each time
step. The resulting models are able to infer activity for missing samples by
combining observations with learned latent dynamics. We test SBTT applied to
sequential autoencoders and demonstrate more efficient and higher-fidelity
characterization of neural population dynamics in electrophysiological and
calcium imaging data. In electrophysiology, SBTT enables accurate inference of
neuronal population dynamics with lower interface bandwidths, providing an
avenue to significant power savings for implanted neuroelectronic interfaces.
In applications to two-photon calcium imaging, SBTT accurately uncovers
high-frequency temporal structure underlying neural population activity,
substantially outperforming the current state-of-the-art. Finally, we
demonstrate that performance could be further improved by using limited,
high-bandwidth sampling to pretrain dynamics models, and then using SBTT to

spread informed by data, the coupling of an epidemiological agent-based model
with the ensemble Kalman filter is proposed. The statistical inference of the
propagation of a disease by means of ensemble-based data assimilation systems
has been studied in previous work. The models used are mostly compartmental
models representing the mean field evolution through ordinary differential
equations. These techniques allow to monitor the propagation of the infections
from data and to estimate several parameters of epidemiological interest.
However, there are many important features which are based on the individual
interactions that cannot be represented in the mean field equations, such as
social network and bubbles, contact tracing, isolating individuals in risk, and
social network-based distancing strategies. Agent-based models can describe
contact networks at an individual level, including demographic attributes such
as age, neighbourhood, household, workplaces, schools, entertainment places,
among others. Nevertheless, these models have several unknown parameters which
are thus difficult to estimate. In this work, we propose the use of
ensemble-based data assimilation techniques to calibrate an agent-based model
using daily epidemiological data. This raises the challenge of having to adapt
the agent populations to incorporate the information provided by the
coarse-grained data. To do this, two stochastic strategies to correct the model
predictions are developed. The ensemble Kalman filter with perturbed
observations is used for the joint estimation of the state and some key
epidemiological parameters. We conduct experiments with an agent based-model
designed for COVID-19 and assess the proposed methodology on synthetic data and

such as subreddit bans to toxic communities -- do they risk angering their user

interventions at the risk of eventually triggering negative media reactions
which might impact their advertising revenue? In this paper, we analyze
Reddit's previous administrative interventions to understand one aspect of this
dilemma: the relationship between the media and administrative interventions.
More specifically, we make two primary contributions. First, using a mediation
analysis framework, we find evidence that Reddit's interventions for violating
their content policy for toxic content occur because of media pressure. Second,
using interrupted time series analysis, we show that media attention on
communities with toxic content only increases the problematic behavior
associated with that community (both within the community itself and across the

administrative interventions on subreddits with and without media pressure.
Taken all together, this study provides evidence of a media-driven moderation
strategy at Reddit and also suggests that such a strategy may not have a
significantly different impact than a more proactive strategy.

that the entanglement spectrum signals a transition between a dominant singlet

analysis of the dominant eigenvector in the reduced state, we can relate the
SS-TS transition to the spatial separation between the fermion pairs in the two
different pairing orderings. The entanglement gap is also able to highlight a
transition - at a few-body level - in the groundstate wavefunction, not
discussed previously in the literature. While other quantifiers are less
sensitive to few-body defects in the wavefunction, the entanglement gap can
work as a magnifying glass for these, capturing such small fluctuations.

instance, while performing an insertion task when the hole or the recipient
part is not visible in the eye-in-hand camera, a learning-based movement
primitive method can be used to generate the end-effector path. Once the
recipient part is in the field of view (FOV), Image-based Visual Servo (IBVS)
can be used to control the motion of the robot. Inspired by such applications,
this paper presents a generalized control scheme that switches between motion
generation using DMPs and IBVS control. To facilitate the design, a common
state space representation for the DMP and the IBVS systems is first
established. Stability analysis of the switched system using multiple Lyapunov
functions shows that the state trajectories converge to a bound asymptotically.
The developed method is validated by two real world experiments using the
eye-in-hand configuration on a Baxter research robot.

application domains. Smart Farming supports devices connected, and with the
support of Internet, cloud or edge computing infrastructure provide remote
control of watering and fertilization, real time monitoring of farm conditions,
and provide solutions to more sustainable practices. This could involve using
irrigation systems only when the detected soil moisture level is low or stop
when the plant reaches a sufficient level of soil moisture content. These
improvements to efficiency and ease of use come with added risks to security
and privacy. Cyber attacks in large coordinated manner can disrupt economy of
agriculture-dependent nations. To the sensors in the system, an attack may
appear as anomalous behaviour. In this context, there are possibilities of
anomalies generated due to faulty hardware, issues in network connectivity (if
present), or simply abrupt changes to the environment due to weather, human
accident, or other unforeseen circumstances. To make such systems more secure,
it is imperative to detect such data discrepancies, and trigger appropriate
mitigation mechanisms. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection model for
Smart Farming using an unsupervised Autoencoder machine learning model. We
chose to use an Autoencoder because it encodes and decodes data and attempts to
ignore outliers. When it encounters anomalous data the result will be a high
reconstruction loss value, signaling that this data was not like the rest. Our
model was trained and tested on data collected from our designed greenhouse
test-bed. Proposed Autoencoder model based anomaly detection achieved 98.98%
and took 262 seconds to train and has a detection time of .0585 seconds.

Spinless impurities generate a random-field type disorder for the spin-density

stripe order in the case of spatially isotropic interactions. Combining
symmetry arguments, percolation theory and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations,
we demonstrate that arbitrarily weak spatial interaction anisotropies restore
the stripe phase. More specifically, the transition temperature $T_c$ into the
stripe phase depends on the interaction anisotropy $\Delta J$ via $T_c \sim
1/|\ln (\Delta J)|$ for small $\Delta J$. This logarithmic dependence implies
that very weak anisotropies are sufficient to restore the transition
temperature to values comparable to that of the undiluted system. We analyze
the critical behavior of the emerging transition and find it to belong to the
disordered two-dimensional Ising universality class, which features the clean
Ising critical exponents and universal logarithmic corrections. We also discuss

correct for these factors, but they must accommodate a non-homogeneous and

integrated with a diffeomorphic volume to slice registration method.
Experiments are performed to validate our contributions and compare with a

engineering for centuries. In this paper, we revisit the Taylor series
expansion from a modern Machine Learning perspective. Specifically, we
introduce the Fast Continuous Convolutional Taylor Transform (FC2T2), a variant
of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM), that allows for the efficient approximation
of low dimensional convolutional operators in continuous space. We build upon
the FMM which is an approximate algorithm that reduces the computational
complexity of N-body problems from O(NM) to O(N+M) and finds application in
e.g. particle simulations. As an intermediary step, the FMM produces a series
expansion for every cell on a grid and we introduce algorithms that act
directly upon this representation. These algorithms analytically but
approximately compute the quantities required for the forward and backward pass
of the backpropagation algorithm and can therefore be employed as (implicit)
layers in Neural Networks. Specifically, we introduce a root-implicit layer
that outputs surface normals and object distances as well as an
integral-implicit layer that outputs a rendering of a radiance field given a 3D
pose. In the context of Machine Learning, $N$ and $M$ can be understood as the
number of model parameters and model evaluations respectively which entails
that, for applications that require repeated function evaluations which are
prevalent in Computer Vision and Graphics, unlike regular Neural Networks, the
techniques introduce in this paper scale gracefully with parameters. For some
applications, this results in a 200x reduction in FLOPs compared to
state-of-the-art approaches at a reasonable or non-existent loss in accuracy.

relativity (GR), the multipolar structure of the radiation (i.e. different
spherical harmonic modes) from a merging quasi-circular binary black hole (BBH)
is fully determined by the intrinsic parameters (i.e. the masses and spins of
the companion black holes). In Refs. [1,2], we have formulated an efficient
test named `higher-modes consistency test' to check for the consistency of the
observed gravitational-wave (GW) signal with the expected multipolar structure
of radiation from BBHs in GR. Detection of the high-mass-ratio merger of
GW190814 enables the observation of spherical harmonic modes beyond the
dominant $(\ell, m) = (2,\pm2)$ mode; thereby providing a unique opportunity to
perform the `higher-modes consistency test'. Using different state-of-art
waveform models (IMRPhenomXPHM, IMRPhenomXHM, IMRPhenomHM and SEONNRv4HM_ROM),
we show that GW190814 strongly favors the ""no-hair"" hypothesis in GR over a
hypothesis that assumes generic deviation from the multipolar structure of the
radiation by a Bayes factor of $\rm log_{e}\mathcal{B}\sim8$. We further
investigate any potential systematic errors arising as a result of different
waveform modeling choices as well as due to neglecting many higher order modes.
We find that, if the waveform model includes only $(\ell, m) = (3,\pm3)$ mode
in its higher harmonics, the same event may reject the `no-hair' hypothesis in
GR when the detector sensitivity improves by a factor of $12.5$. Our analysis,
therefore, provides motivation to include as many higher order modes as
possible in future waveform models.

information theory. Using this representation, we show that the evolution of a
single bosonic mode under a Gaussian Hamiltonian can be described as an
integrable dynamical system of classical Calogero-Moser particles corresponding
to the zeros of the holomorphic function, together with a conformal evolution
of Gaussian parameters. We explain that the Calogero-Moser dynamics is due to
unique features of bosonic Hilbert spaces such as squeezing. We then generalize
the properties of this holomorphic representation to the multimode case,
deriving a non-Gaussian hierarchy of quantum states and relating entanglement
to factorization properties of holomorphic functions. Finally, we apply this
formalism to discrete- and continuous- variable quantum measurements and obtain
a classification of subuniversal models that are generalizations of Boson

for discrete Schr\""odinger equations with power law nonlinearities, posed on
${\mathbb Z}^d$. More specifically, he constructed the so-called normalized
waves, by minimizing the Hamiltonian functional, for fixed power $P$ (i.e.
$l^2$ mass). This type of variational method allows one to claim, in a
straightforward manner, set stability for such waves.
  In this work, we revisit and build upon Weinstein's work in several
directions. First, for the normalized waves, we show that they are in fact
spectrally stable as solutions of the corresponding discrete NLS evolution
equation. Next, we construct the so-called homogeneous waves, by using a
different constrained optimization problem. Importantly, this construction
works for all values of the parameters, e.g. $l^2$ supercritical problems. We
establish a rigorous criterion for stability, which decides the stability on
the homogeneous waves, based on the classical
Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss/Vakhitov-Kolokolov quantity $\partial_\omega
\|\varphi_\omega\|_{l^2}^2$. In addition, we provide some symmetry results for
the solitons. Finally, we complement our results with numerical computations,
which showcase the full agreement between the conclusion from the GSS/VK
criterion vis-\'a-vis with the linearized problem. In particular, one observes
that it is possible for the stability of the wave to change as the spectral
parameter $\omega$ varies, in contrast with the corresponding continuous NLS
model.

modeling movement in vector-borne diseases for discrete space. In the Eulerian

account for the proportion of time that individuals spend in foreign patches

$P$. We say that the two modeling frameworks are consistent if for a given
matrix $P$, the matrix $L$ can be chosen so that the residence times of the
matrix $P$ and the matrix $L$ match. We find a sufficient condition for
consistency, and examine disease quantities such as the final outbreak size and
basic reproduction number in both the consistent and inconsistent cases. In the
special case of a two-patch model, we observe how similar values for the basic
reproduction number and final outbreak size can occur even in the inconsistent
case. However, there are scenarios where the final sizes in both approaches can
significantly differ by means of the relationship we propose.

In this work, by means of a low energy kp model analysis, a mechanism of

inversion is developed. Through first-principles calculations, this mechanism
is further established in a ferromagnetic hexagonal lattice of single-layer

anomalous valley Hall effect nor valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect
in nature. Remarkably, these two Hall effects emerge simultaneously in this

increasing strain, suggesting the exotic valley-related multiple Hall effect.
The underlying physical mechanism is revealed using a model analysis and is
generally applicable. Our work greatly enriches the valley-related physics.

simulation of biological cells with a particular emphasis on effective modeling
of structural properties that originate from active forces generated from
polymerization and depolymerization of cytoskeletal components. In detail, we
propose a nonlinear continuum approach to model microtubule-based forces which
have recently been established as central components of cell mechanics during
early fruit fly wing development. The model is discretized in space using the
finite-element method. Although the individual equations are decoupled by a
semi-implicit time discretization, the discrete model is still computationally
demanding. In addition, the parameters needed for the effective model equations
are not easily available and have to be estimated or determined by repeatedly
solving the model and fitting the results to measurements. This drastically
increases the computational cost. Reduced basis methods have been used
successfully to speed up such repeated solves, often by several orders of
magnitude. However, for the complex nonlinear models regarded here, the
application of these model order reduction methods is not always
straight-forward and comes with its own set of challenges. In particular,
subspace construction using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) becomes
prohibitively expensive for reasonably fine grids. We thus propose to combine
the Hierarchical Approximate POD, which is a general, easy-to-implement
approach to compute an approximate POD, with an Empirical Interpolation Method
to efficiently generate a fast to evaluate reduced order model. Numerical
experiments are given to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the
proposed modeling and simulation approach.

measurement in mine atmosphere using a single gross-alpha count of a
membrane-filtered air. The method is still widely used today and is based on a
number of impractical assumptions. An instantaneous sampling time (less than
ten seconds), is one of these assumptions that ignores the build-up and decay
of the progeny on the filter paper during the sampling period. Of special
concern is the 214Bi decay during the sampling period, since 214Po alphas are
lost during the sampling time and cannot be accounted for during the counting
time. In addition, the method assumes that 214Bi activity during the counting
period is constant. This inaccurate assumption can result in a smaller count
rate, especially when counting times are long. Hence underestimated working
levels are expected when using Kusnetz factors without correcting for the
sampling and counting times. In this technical report, exact sampling and
counting time corrections to the method are provided along with the updated
Kusnetz factors that correspond to common equilibrium conditions to correctly
estimate the Working Level in air. Additionally, time corrections to the

capability of recognizing objects in out-of-distribution (OoD) orientations and
illuminations, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) severely suffer in this case, even
when large amounts of training examples are available. In this paper, we
investigate three different approaches to improve DNNs in recognizing objects
in OoD orientations and illuminations. Namely, these are (i) training much
longer after convergence of the in-distribution (InD) validation accuracy,
i.e., late-stopping, (ii) tuning the momentum parameter of the batch
normalization layers, and (iii) enforcing invariance of the neural activity in
an intermediate layer to orientation and illumination conditions. Each of these
approaches substantially improves the DNN's OoD accuracy (more than 20% in some
cases). We report results in four datasets: two datasets are modified from the
MNIST and iLab datasets, and the other two are novel (one of 3D rendered cars
and another of objects taken from various controlled orientations and
illumination conditions). These datasets allow to study the effects of
different amounts of bias and are challenging as DNNs perform poorly in OoD
conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that even though the three approaches focus
on different aspects of DNNs, they all tend to lead to the same underlying
neural mechanism to enable OoD accuracy gains --individual neurons in the
intermediate layers become more selective to a category and also invariant to
OoD orientations and illuminations. We anticipate this study to be a basis for
further improvement of deep neural networks' OoD generalization performance,

obtaining rich dynamic representations for fast adaptation beyond simple

by introducing neuromodulation as a modular component to augment a standard

shown to be biased under extreme conditions, the degree and determinants of
bias have not been formally assessed. Methods: We derived the formula for the
relative bias in the MCIM and systematically investigated conditions under
which bias arises. Results: We found that the extent of bias is independent of
both the disease rate and the exposure-outcome association, but is a function
of 5 parameters: exposure and covariate prevalences, covariate missingness
proportion, and associations of covariate with exposure and outcome. The MCIM
was unbiased when the missing covariate is a risk factor for the outcome but
not a confounder. The average median relative bias was zero across each of the
parameters over a wide range of values considered. When missingness was no
greater than 50%, less than 5% of the scenarios considered had relative bias
greater than 10%. In several analyses of the Harvard cohort studies, the MCIM
produced materially the same results as the multiple imputation method.
Conclusion: The MCIM is nearly valid almost always in settings typically
encountered in epidemiology and its continued use is recommended, unless the
covariate is missing in an extreme proportion or acts as a strong confounder.

from a single image by exploiting differentiable renderers. Many previous
learning-based approaches for inverse graphics adopt rasterization-based
renderers and assume naive lighting and material models, which often fail to
account for non-Lambertian, specular reflections commonly observed in the wild.
In this work, we propose DIBR++, a hybrid differentiable renderer which
supports these photorealistic effects by combining rasterization and
ray-tracing, taking the advantage of their respective strengths -- speed and
realism. Our renderer incorporates environmental lighting and spatially-varying
material models to efficiently approximate light transport, either through
direct estimation or via spherical basis functions. Compared to more advanced
physics-based differentiable renderers leveraging path tracing, DIBR++ is
highly performant due to its compact and expressive shading model, which
enables easy integration with learning frameworks for geometry, reflectance and
lighting prediction from a single image without requiring any ground-truth. We
experimentally demonstrate that our approach achieves superior material and
lighting disentanglement on synthetic and real data compared to existing
rasterization-based approaches and showcase several artistic applications

quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE) to describe the flying-qubit
input-output relations actuated by a standing quantum system. Under the
continuous time-ordered photon-number basis, the infinite-dimensional QSDE is
reduced to a low-dimensional deterministic non-unitary differential equation
for the state evolution of the standing system, and the outgoing flying-qubit
states can be calculated via randomly occurring quantum jumps. This makes it
possible, as demonstrated by examples of flying-qubit generation and
transformation, to analyze general cases when the number of excitations is not

flying-qubit control systems from a control theoretic point of view, within

simulation is important for describing various quantum many-body systems.
However, the HFB problem in Cartesian coordinate space is numerically
challenging.
  Purpose: For describing ground states without imposing axial symmetry and
looking ahead to future extension for dynamics with full time dependence, we
present a numerically efficient implementation of the three-dimensional (3D)
HFB code.
  Methods: We develop a 3D Skyrme HFB code based on the mixed-basis
representation (HFBmix) which consists of two harmonic-oscillator (HO) bases in
the x- and y-directions, and finite-difference (FD) basis in the z-direction in
solving the nuclear 3D HFB problem.
  Results: The results show very well agreement among all the three codes
(HFBmix, HO3D, and hfodd). Especially for the HF calculations, the differences
in total energies are on the order of a few keV for the lightest O and Mg
nuclei. The HFBmix is applied to spherical, prolate, and triaxial systems, and
gives the same quadrupole moments for the deformed nuclei as those of the
HO-based calculations. Feasibility of the HFBmix is demonstrated in the fission
isomer and barrier calculations of 240Pu.
  Conclusions: The HFBmix is useful for solving the nuclear 3D HFB problem for
its numerical efficiency. Future work will include the analysis of deformed
drip-line systems and systematic potential-energy surface calculation for
fission-path analysis as well as the time-dependent extension of the HFBmix

currently requires both strategies to mitigate high levels of noise and also
tools to ease the challenge of programming these systems with pulse- or

  This work focuses on improving the state-of-the-art for quantum programming
of ion trap testbeds through the use of a quantum language specification, QCOR,
and by demonstrating multi-level optimizations at the language, intermediate

multi-level optimizations to improve circuit fidelity and to reduce gate count.
These techniques include the usage of a backend-specific numerical optimizer
and physical gate optimizations to minimize the number of native instructions

benchmark programs, finding that on present testbed hardware, our compiler
backend maintains the number of two-qubit native operations but decreases the
number of single-qubit native operations by 1.54 times compared to the previous
compiler regime. For projected testbed hardware upgrades, our compiler sees a

dormant comets. Due to their similar appearance, it is challenging to
distinguish dormant comets from ACOs via general telescopic observations.
Surveys for discriminating dormant comets from the ACO population have been
conducted via spectroscopy or optical and mid-infrared photometry. However,
they have not been conducted through polarimetry.
  Aims. We conducted the first polarimetric research of ACOs.
  Methods. We conducted a linear polarimetric pilot survey for three ACOs:
(944) Hidalgo, (3552) Don Quixote, and (331471) 1984 QY1. These objects are
unambiguously classified into ACOs in terms of their orbital elements (i.e.,
the Tisserand parameters with respect to Jupiter $T_\mathrm{J}$ significantly
less than 3). Three ACOs were observed by the 1.6 m Pirka Telescope from UT
2016 May 25 to UT 2019 July 22 (13 nights).
  Results. We found that Don Quixote and Hidalgo have polarimetric properties
similar to comet nuclei and D-type asteroids (optical analogs of comet nuclei).
However, 1984 QY1 exhibited a polarimetric property consistent with S-type
asteroids. We conducted a backward orbital integration to determine the origin
of 1984 QY1, and found that this object was transported from the main belt into
the current comet-like orbit via the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter.
  Conclusions. We conclude that the origins of ACOs can be more reliably
identified by adding polarimetric data to the color and spectral information.
This study would be valuable for investigating how the ice-bearing small bodies
distribute in the inner Solar System.

the final evolutionary stage of primitive solar system objects. A near-Sun
asteroid, (155140) 2005 UD, has orbital elements similar to those of (3200)
Phaethon (the target asteroid for the JAXA's $DESTINY^+$ mission). We conducted
photometric and polarimetric observations of 2005 UD and found that this
asteroid exhibits a polarization phase curve similar to that of Phaethon over a
wide range of observed solar phase angles ($ \alpha = 20 - 105^\circ $) but
different from those of (101955) Bennu and (162173) Ryugu (asteroids composed
of hydrated carbonaceous materials). At a low phase angle ($\alpha \lesssim
30^\circ$), the polarimetric properties of these near-Sun asteroids (2005 UD
and Phaethon) are consistent with anhydrous carbonaceous chondrites, while the
properties of Bennu are consistent with hydrous carbonaceous chondrites. We
derived the geometric albedo, $ p_\mathrm{V} \sim 0.1 $ (in the range of
0.088-0.109); mean $ V $-band absolute magnitude, $ H_\mathrm{V} = 17.54 \pm
0.02 $; synodic rotational period, $ T_\mathrm{rot} = 5.2388 \pm 0.0022 $ hours
(the two-peaked solution is assumed); and effective mean diameter, $
D_\mathrm{eff} = 1.32 \pm 0.06 $ km. At large phase angles ($ \alpha \gtrsim
80^\circ$), the polarization phase curve are likely explained by the dominance
of large grains and the paucity of small micron-sized grains. We conclude that
the polarimetric similarity of these near-Sun asteroids can be attributed to
the intense solar heating of carbonaceous materials around their perihelia,
where large anhydrous particles with small porosity could be produced by
sintering.

namely RMSMP, with a Row-wise Mixed-Scheme and Multi-Precision approach.
Specifically, this is the first effort to assign mixed quantization schemes and
multiple precisions within layers -- among rows of the DNN weight matrix, for
simplified operations in hardware inference, while preserving accuracy.
Furthermore, this paper makes a different observation from the prior work that
the quantization error does not necessarily exhibit the layer-wise sensitivity,
and actually can be mitigated as long as a certain portion of the weights in
every layer are in higher precisions. This observation enables layer-wise
uniformality in the hardware implementation towards guaranteed inference
acceleration, while still enjoying row-wise flexibility of mixed schemes and
multiple precisions to boost accuracy. The candidates of schemes and precisions
are derived practically and effectively with a highly hardware-informative
strategy to reduce the problem search space. With the offline determined ratio
of different quantization schemes and precisions for all the layers, the RMSMP
quantization algorithm uses the Hessian and variance-based method to
effectively assign schemes and precisions for each row. The proposed RMSMP is
tested for the image classification and natural language processing (BERT)
applications and achieves the best accuracy performance among state-of-the-arts
under the same equivalent precisions. The RMSMP is implemented on FPGA devices,
achieving 3.65x speedup in the end-to-end inference time for ResNet-18 on

composed of a material with a large second-order nonlinear optical
susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$. Our proposal relies on two facts: (1) A nonlinear
photonic crystal changes coherent incident light into squeezed light. (2) A
beam splitter transforms the squeezed light into entangled light beams flying
in two different directions. We estimate the yield efficiency of pairs of
entangled photons per pulse of the very weak coherent light for our method at
$0.0783$ for a specific concrete example. Our method is more effective because
the conversion efficiency (entangled biphotons per incident pump photons) in
the spontaneous parametric downconversion is of the order of $4\times 10^{-6}$.
The only drawback is that it requires very fine tuning of the frequency of
signal photons fed into the photonic crystal; for example, an adjustment is
given by $\Delta\nu=3.11\times 10^{8}$ Hz for the signal light of
$\nu=3.23\times 10^{14}$ Hz. We investigate the application of entangled
photons produced by our method to the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol,

processing (NLP), serving as the starting point for fine-tuning towards a range
of downstream tasks. However, two pain points persist for this paradigm: (a) as
the pre-trained models grow bigger (e.g., 175B parameters for GPT-3), even the
fine-tuning process can be time-consuming and computationally expensive; (b)
the fine-tuned model has the same size as its starting point by default, which
is neither sensible due to its more specialized functionality, nor practical
since many fine-tuned models will be deployed in resource-constrained
environments. To address these pain points, we propose a framework for
resource- and parameter-efficient fine-tuning by leveraging the sparsity prior
in both weight updates and the final model weights. Our proposed framework,
dubbed Dually Sparsity-Embedded Efficient Tuning (DSEE), aims to achieve two
key objectives: (i) parameter efficient fine-tuning - by enforcing
sparsity-aware low-rank updates on top of the pre-trained weights; and (ii)
resource-efficient inference - by encouraging a sparse weight structure towards
the final fine-tuned model. We leverage sparsity in these two directions by
exploiting both unstructured and structured sparse patterns in pre-trained
language models via a unified approach. Extensive experiments and in-depth
investigations, with diverse network backbones (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2)
on dozens of datasets, consistently demonstrate impressive
parameter-/inference-efficiency, while maintaining competitive downstream
performance. For instance, DSEE saves about 25% inference FLOPs while achieving
comparable performance, with 0.5% trainable parameters on BERT. Codes are

The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) emerges as a promising framework to

sacrificing the performance. The main resource bottleneck of LTH is however the
extraordinary cost to find the sparse mask of the winning ticket. That makes

performance of relational database query optimizers due to its complexity and
completeness. In order to compute the optimal execution plan -- join order --
existing solutions employ extensive data synopses and correlations --
functional dependencies -- between table attributes. These structures incur
significant overhead to design, build, and maintain. In this paper, we present
\textit{Simpli}city \textit{Simpli}fied (\textit{Simpli-Squared}), a very
simple join ordering algorithm that achieves unexpectedly good results.
Simpli-Squared computes the join order without using any statistics or
cardinality estimates. It takes as input only the referential integrity
constraints declared at schema definition and the number of tuples (size) in
the base tables. The join order of a given query is computed by splitting the
join graph along the many-to-many joins and sorting the tables based on their
size. The tables involved in one-to-many joins are greedily included based on
size and the query join graph. The resulting plan can be efficiently generated
by a lightweight query rewriting procedure. Experiments on the JOB benchmark in
PostgreSQL show that Simpli-Squared achieves runtimes having an increase of
only up to 16\% -- and sometimes even a reduction -- compared to four
state-of-the-art solutions that are considerably more intricate. Based on these
results, we question whether JOB adequately tests query optimizers or if

as well as a vanilla semi-supervised learning method. Hierarchical information
is often available as prior knowledge in the form of coarse labels (e.g.,

golden-fronted woodpeckers). However, the use of supervision using coarse
category labels to improve semi-supervised techniques has not been explored. In
the absence of fine-grained labels, HIERMATCH exploits the label hierarchy and
uses coarse class labels as a weak supervisory signal. Additionally, HIERMATCH
is a generic-approach to improve any semisupervised learning framework, we
demonstrate this using our results on recent state-of-the-art techniques
MixMatch and FixMatch. We evaluate the efficacy of HIERMATCH on two benchmark

However, it differs from the conventional ground-based interferometer array or

UAV applications, operation in harsh environments, limited payload and onboard
computing power and highly nonlinear dynamics. The work presented in this
report contributes towards the state-of-the-art in UAV control for safe
autonomous navigation and motion coordination of multi-UAV systems. The first
part of this report deals with single-UAV systems. The complex problem of
three-dimensional (3D) collision-free navigation in unknown/dynamic
environments is addressed. To that end, advanced 3D reactive control strategies
are developed adopting the sense-and-avoid paradigm to produce quick reactions
around obstacles. A special case of navigation in 3D unknown confined
environments (i.e. tunnel-like) is also addressed. General 3D kinematic models
are considered in the design which makes these methods applicable to different
UAV types in addition to underwater vehicles. Moreover, different
implementation methods for these strategies with quadrotor-type UAVs are also
investigated considering UAV dynamics in the control design. Practical
experiments and simulations were carried out to analyze the performance of the
developed methods. The second part of this report addresses safe navigation for
multi-UAV systems. Distributed motion coordination methods of multi-UAV systems
for flocking and 3D area coverage are developed. These methods offer good

nearly the same level of accuracy as fixed infrastructure approaches for AR
teaming applications. LocAR uses visual-inertial odometry (VIO) in conjunction
with ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging radios to estimate the relative position of
each device in an ad-hoc manner. The system leverages a collaborative 6DoF
particle filtering formulation that operates on sporadic messages exchanged
between nearby users. Unlike map or landmark sharing approaches, this allows
for collaborative AR sessions even if users do not overlap the same spaces.
LocAR consists of an open-source UWB firmware and reference mobile phone
application that can display the location of team members in real-time using
mobile AR. We evaluate LocAR across multiple buildings under a wide-variety of
conditions including a contiguous 30,000 square foot region spanning multiple
floors and find that it achieves median geometric error in 3D of less than 1
meter between five users freely walking across 3 floors.

there is very little quantitative evidence available on the extent or nature of

comprehensive quantitative analysis of phone sharing in Togo, and documents how
a large cash transfer program during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted sharing
patterns. We analyze mobile phone records from the entire Togolese mobile
network to measure the movement of SIM cards between SIM card slots (often on
different mobile devices). First, we document the prevalence of sharing in
Togo, with 22% of SIMs and 7% of SIM slots shared. Second, using administrative
data from a government-run cash transfer program, we find that phone sharing is
most common among women, young people, and people in rural areas. Finally, we
find that the delivery of cash aid via mobile money significantly increases
phone sharing among beneficiaries. We discuss the limitations of measuring
phone sharing with mobile network data and the implications of our results for
future aid programs delivered via mobile money.

recognition systems, the SIFT approach does not rely on the transformation of
the iris pattern to polar coordinates or on highly accurate segmentation,
allowing less constrained image acquisition conditions. We extract
characteristic SIFT feature points in scale space and perform matching based on
the texture information around the feature points using the SIFT operator.
Experiments are done using the BioSec multimodal database, which includes 3,200
iris images from 200 individuals acquired in two different sessions. We
contribute with the analysis of the influence of different SIFT parameters on
the recognition performance. We also show the complementarity between the SIFT

achieves significantly better performance than either of the individual

decisions of deep learning models, it is essential to understand what
properties quantitative evaluation metrics do capture and equally important
what they do not capture. Currently, such understanding is lacking, potentially
slowing down scientific progress. In this paper, we consolidate the work on
evaluating visual counterfactual examples through an analysis and experiments.
We find that while most metrics behave as intended for sufficiently simple
datasets, some fail to tell the difference between good and bad counterfactuals
when the complexity increases. We observe experimentally that metrics give good
scores to tiny adversarial-like changes, wrongly identifying such changes as
superior counterfactual examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose two new
metrics, the Label Variation Score and the Oracle score, which are both less
vulnerable to such tiny changes. We conclude that a proper quantitative
evaluation of visual counterfactual examples should combine metrics to ensure
that all aspects of good counterfactuals are quantified.

studied heterostructures of TBG and hBN using an atomistic tight-binding model
together with semi-classical molecular dynamics to take into account relaxation
effects. We found that the presence of the hBN substrate has significant
effects to the band structure of TBG even in the case where TBG and hBN are not

pseudomagnetic fields which break the layer degeneracy. Interestingly, such
degeneracy can be recovered with a second hBN layer. Finally, we have also
developed a continuum model that describes the tight-binding band structure.
Our results show that a real-space tight-binding model in combination with
semi-classical molecular dynamics are a powerful tool to study the electronic

step mitigates this size-induced gene repression and alters the scaling
relation of gene expression level on compartment volume, approaching the
regular scaling relation without the steric effect. This recovery of regular
size-scaling of gene expression does not appear in positive feedback
regulation, suggesting that negative autoregulatory feedback is crucial for
maintaining reaction products constant regardless of compartment size in

of the low resolution audio signals. While audio in nature is a continuous
signal, current approaches treat it as discrete data (i.e., input is defined on
discrete time domain), and consider the super resolution over a fixed scale
factor (i.e., it is required to train a new neural network to change output
resolution). To obtain a continuous representation of audio and enable super
resolution for arbitrary scale factor, we propose a method of implicit neural
representation, coined Local Implicit representation for Super resolution of
Arbitrary scale (LISA). Our method locally parameterizes a chunk of audio as a
function of continuous time, and represents each chunk with the local latent
codes of neighboring chunks so that the function can extrapolate the signal at
any time coordinate, i.e., infinite resolution. To learn a continuous
representation for audio, we design a self-supervised learning strategy to
practice super resolution tasks up to the original resolution by stochastic
selection. Our numerical evaluation shows that LISA outperforms the previous
fixed-scale methods with a fraction of parameters, but also is capable of
arbitrary scale super resolution even beyond the resolution of training data.

in enabling real-world natural language processing (NLP) applications. However,
a pre-trained model with backdoor can be a severe threat to the applications.
Most existing backdoor attacks in NLP are conducted in the fine-tuning phase by
introducing malicious triggers in the targeted class, thus relying greatly on
the prior knowledge of the fine-tuning task. In this paper, we propose a new
approach to map the inputs containing triggers directly to a predefined output
representation of the pre-trained NLP models, e.g., a predefined output
representation for the classification token in BERT, instead of a target label.
It can thus introduce backdoor to a wide range of downstream tasks without any
prior knowledge. Additionally, in light of the unique properties of triggers in
NLP, we propose two new metrics to measure the performance of backdoor attacks
in terms of both effectiveness and stealthiness. Our experiments with various
types of triggers show that our method is widely applicable to different
fine-tuning tasks (classification and named entity recognition) and to
different models (such as BERT, XLNet, BART), which poses a severe threat.
Furthermore, by collaborating with the popular online model repository Hugging
Face, the threat brought by our method has been confirmed. Finally, we analyze
the factors that may affect the attack performance and share insights on the
causes of the success of our backdoor attack.

Be it a planned smart city or even a wreckage site affected by natural

blockage as obstacles for the drone to fly in a straight line-of-sight path. To
address such path-planning of drones, the bird's eye-view of the whole

occupied to indicate the obstacles and some are free to indicate the free path.
We propose a method to find out the shortest obstacle-free path in the
coordinate system guided by GPS. The autonomous drone (AutoDrone) will thus be
able to move from one place to another along the shortest path, without
colliding into hindrances, while traveling in a two-dimensional space.
Heuristics to extend this to long journeys and 3D space are also elaborated.
Our approach can be especially beneficial in rescue operations and fast

in finding out the shortest path and angle along which it should fly.
Experiments are done on different scenarios of map layouts and obstacle

exaggerated motions. Due to such huge differences between different styles, it
is necessary to incorporate the talking style into audio-driven talking face

particular reference video. Specifically, we systematically investigate talking
styles with our collected \textit{Ted-HD} dataset and construct style codes as
several statistics of 3D morphable model~(3DMM) parameters. Afterwards, we
devise a latent-style-fusion~(LSF) model to synthesize stylized talking faces
by imitating talking styles from the style codes. We emphasize the following
novel characteristics of our framework: (1) It doesn't require any annotation
of the style, the talking style is learned in an unsupervised manner from
talking videos in the wild. (2) It can imitate arbitrary styles from arbitrary
videos, and the style codes can also be interpolated to generate new styles.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework has the ability
to synthesize more natural and expressive talking styles compared with baseline
methods.

evolution of leptonic galaxy bubbles driven by a 0.3 Myr intense explosive
outburst from the nucleus of Milky Way-like galaxies. Adopting an ageing model
for their leptonic cosmic rays, we post-process our simulations to compute the
multi-wavelength emission properties of these bubbles. We calculate the
resulting spectra emitted from the bubbles from radio frequencies to
$\gamma$-rays, and construct emission maps in four energy bands to show the
development of the spatial emission structure of the bubbles. The simulated
bubbles show a progression in their spectral properties as they age. In
particular, the TeV $\gamma$-ray emission is initially strong and dominated by
inverse Compton scattering, but falls rapidly after $\sim$ 1 Myr. By contrast,
the radio synchrotron emission remains relatively stable and fades slowly over
the lifetime of the bubble. Based on the emission properties of our
post-processed simulations, we demonstrate that $\gamma$-ray observations will
be limited in their ability to detect galaxy bubbles, with only young bubbles
around nearby galaxies being within reach. However, radio observations with
e.g. the up-coming Square Kilometer Array, would be able to detect
substantially older bubbles at much greater distances, and would be better
placed to capture the evolutionary progression and diversity of galaxy bubble

introduce a novel method mixing multiple inner steps that enjoys a more

to a $k$-step adjacent region of the current state using an adjacency
constraint. We theoretically prove that in a deterministic Markov Decision
Process (MDP), the proposed adjacency constraint preserves the optimal
hierarchical policy, while in a stochastic MDP the adjacency constraint induces
a bounded state-value suboptimality determined by the MDP's transition
structure. We further show that this constraint can be practically implemented
by training an adjacency network that can discriminate between adjacent and
non-adjacent subgoals. Experimental results on discrete and continuous control
tasks including challenging simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks
show that incorporating the adjacency constraint significantly boosts the
performance of state-of-the-art goal-conditioned HRL approaches.

large number of applications, including in image classification and
segmentation. They provide a new perspective in training very deep neural
networks without suffering the vanishing gradient problem. In this article we
show that ResNets are able to approximate solutions of Kolmogorov partial
differential equations (PDEs) with constant diffusion and possibly nonlinear
drift coefficients without suffering the curse of dimensionality, which is to
say the number of parameters of the approximating ResNets grows at most
polynomially in the reciprocal of the approximation accuracy $\varepsilon > 0$
and the dimension of the considered PDE $d\in\mathbb{N}$. We adapt a proof in

- to ResNets. In contrast to FNNs, the Euler-Maruyama approximation structure
of ResNets simplifies the construction of the approximating ResNets
substantially. Moreover, contrary to the above work, in our proof using ResNets
does not require the existence of an FNN (or a ResNet) representing the
identity map, which enlarges the set of applicable activation functions.

regularization terms is a mathematically elegant alternative that is valid for
any spacial dimension, however, it requires certain regularity assumptions on

available by DSLR and mobile-phone cameras. While deep neural networks (DNN)
have greatly impacted other domains of image manipulation, their use for HDR
tone-mapping is limited due to the lack of a definite notion of ground-truth
solution, which is needed for producing training data.
  In this paper we describe a new tone-mapping approach guided by the distinct
goal of producing low dynamic range (LDR) renditions that best reproduce the
visual characteristics of native LDR images. This goal enables the use of an
unpaired adversarial training based on unrelated sets of HDR and LDR images,
both of which are widely available and easy to acquire.
  In order to achieve an effective training under this minimal requirements, we
introduce the following new steps and components: (i) a range-normalizing
pre-process which estimates and applies a different level of curve-based
compression, (ii) a loss that preserves the input content while allowing the
network to achieve its goal, and (iii) the use of a more concise discriminator
network, designed to promote the reproduction of low-level attributes native
LDR possess.
  Evaluation of the resulting network demonstrates its ability to produce
photo-realistic artifact-free tone-mapped images, and state-of-the-art
performance on different image fidelity indices and visual distances.

neutrino sources in the Universe and the measurement of the neutrino
oscillation parameters with atmospheric neutrinos. Both extraterrestrial and
atmospheric neutrinos are detected through the Cherenkov light induced in
seawater by charged particles produced in neutrino interactions in the
surrounding medium. A relative time synchronization between photomultipliers of
the order of 1 ns is needed to guarantee the required angular resolution of the

scattering have modified spectra due to the background B field, though this
effect is usually small in systems of current practical interest. We identify a
scattering process we call stimulated whistler scattering, where a light wave
decays to an electromagnetic whistler wave ($\omega \lesssim \omega_{ce}$) and
a Langmuir wave. This only occurs in the presence of an external B field, which
is required for the whistler wave to exist. We compute the scattered

The functions $r_z,$ called coupling resonances, are important in the spectral
analysis of $H_0 + r V$ for any real number $r.$ For instance, they afford a
description of the spectral shift function (SSF) of the pair $H_0$ and $V,$ as
well as the absolutely continuous and singular parts of the SSF. A thorough

Pyramid (MP), to reduce both width-wise and depth-wise computation via token
pruning and early exiting for Transformer-based models, particularly BERT. The
former manages to save the computation via removing non-salient tokens, while
the latter can fulfill the computation reduction by terminating the inference
early before reaching the final layer, if the exiting condition is met. Our

not only able to achieve a speed-adjustable inference but also to surpass token
pruning and early exiting by reducing up to 70% giga floating point operations

express distinctive preferences to sequences with different lengths. However,
MP is capable of achieving an average of 8.06x speedup on two popular text

and latent features to segment a 3D scene into semantically meaningful subsets.
Each head combines local and global information, using either the geometric or
latent features, of a neighborhood of points and uses this information to learn
better local relationships. This Geometric-Latent attention layer (Ge-Latto) is
combined with a sub-sampling strategy to capture global features. Our method is
invariant to permutation thanks to the use of shared-MLP layers, and it can
also be used with point clouds with varying densities because the local
attention layer does not depend on the neighbor order. Our proposal is simple
yet robust, which allows it to achieve competitive results in the ShapeNetPart
and ModelNet40 datasets, and the state-of-the-art when segmenting the complex

object categories with few support examples. Its re-popularity in light of the
deep learning development is mainly in image classification. This work focuses
on few-shot semantic segmentation, which is still a largely unexplored field. A
few recent advances are often restricted to single-class few-shot segmentation.
In this paper, we first present a novel multi-way (class) encoding and decoding
architecture which effectively fuses multi-scale query information and
multi-class support information into one query-support embedding. Multi-class
segmentation is directly decoded upon this embedding. For better feature
fusion, a multi-level attention mechanism is proposed within the architecture,
which includes the attention for support feature modulation and attention for
multi-scale combination. Last, to enhance the embedding space learning, an
additional pixel-wise metric learning module is introduced with triplet loss
formulated on the pixel-level embedding of the input image. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show clear benefits
of our method over the state of the art in few-shot segmentation

laminar and turbulent states. At the lower end of the transition, localized
turbulent pulses, called puffs, can be excited. Puffs can decay when rare
fluctuations drive them close to an edge state lying at the phase-space
boundary with laminar flow. At higher Reynolds numbers, homogeneous turbulence
can be sustained, and dominates over laminar flow. Here we complete this
landscape of localized states, placing it within a unified bifurcation picture.
We demonstrate our claims within the Barkley model, and motivate them
generally. Specifically, we suggest the existence of an antipuff and a gap-edge
-- states which mirror the puff and related edge state. Previously observed
laminar gaps forming within homogeneous turbulence are then naturally
identified as antipuffs nucleating and decaying through the gap edge.

machine learning has been an emerging tool for solving the placement and
routing problems, as two critical steps in modern chip design flow. Being still
in its early stage, there are fundamental issues: scalability, reward design,
and end-to-end learning paradigm etc. To achieve end-to-end placement learning,
we first propose a joint learning method termed by DeepPlace for the placement
of macros and standard cells, by the integration of reinforcement learning with
a gradient based optimization scheme. To further bridge the placement with the
subsequent routing task, we also develop a joint learning approach via
reinforcement learning to fulfill both macro placement and routing, which is
called DeepPR. One key design in our (reinforcement) learning paradigm involves
a multi-view embedding model to encode both global graph level and local node
level information of the input macros. Moreover, the random network
distillation is devised to encourage exploration. Experiments on public chip
design benchmarks show that our method can effectively learn from experience
and also provides intermediate placement for the post standard cell placement,

elements of its entries and has been known as one of the significant and
widely-used problems in recent years. The required number of observations for
exact completion is directly proportional to rank and the coherency parameter
of the matrix. In many applications, there might exist additional information
about the low-rank matrix of interest. For example, in collaborative filtering,
Netflix and dynamic channel estimation in communications, extra subspace
information is available. More precisely in these applications, there are prior
subspaces forming multiple angles with the ground-truth subspaces. In this
paper, we propose a novel strategy to incorporate this information into the
completion task. To this end, we designed a multi-weight nuclear norm
minimization where the weights are such chosen to penalize each angle within
the matrix subspace independently. We propose a new scheme for optimally
choosing the weights. Specifically, we first calculate an upper-bound
expression describing the coherency of the interested matrix. Then, we obtain
the optimal weights by minimizing this expression. Simulation results certify
the advantages of allowing multiple weights in the completion procedure.
Explicitly, they indicate that our proposed multi-weight problem needs fewer
observations compared to state-of-the-art methods.

general fiber introduced by Huybrechts--Macr\`i--Stellari. Passing to the
derived category, we obtain a description of the derived category of the

nonbirational Calabi--Yau threefolds that are derived-equivalent. They consist
of geometric generic fibers of smooth projective versal deformations of several

another application, given two flat proper families of algebraic varieties over

low-latency real-time applications. Modern applications inturn have adopted the
microservices architecture which composes applications as loosely coupled
smaller components, or services. This complements edge computing infrastructure
that are often resource constrained and may not handle monolithic applications.
Instead, edge servers can independently deploy application service components,
although at the cost of communication overheads. Consistently meeting
application service level objectives while also optimizing application
deployment (placement and migration of services) cost and communication
overheads in mobile edge cloud environment is non-trivial. In this paper we
propose and evaluate three dynamic placement strategies, two heuristic (greedy
approximation based on set cover, and integer programming based optimization)
and one learning-based algorithm. Their goal is to satisfy the application
constraints, minimize infrastructure deployment cost, while ensuring
availability of services to all clients and User Equipment (UE) in the network
coverage area. The algorithms can be extended to any network topology and
microservice based edge computing applications. For the experiments, we use the
drone swarm navigation as a representative application for edge computing use
cases. Since access to real-world physical testbed for such application is
difficult, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms as a simulation. We
also contrast these algorithms with respect to placement quality, utilization
of clusters, and level of determinism. Our evaluation not only shows that the
learning-based algorithm provides solutions of better quality; it also provides
interesting conclusions regarding when the (more traditional) heuristic
algorithms are actually better suited.

we aim at capturing relations between node pairs from the cross-product between

of small global solutions, and in addition, we want to illustrate the optimal
pointwise decay of the solutions. Furthermore, we show that the Klein-Gordon
part of the system enjoys linear scattering while the wave part has uniformly
bounded low-order energy. None of these goals is easy because of the slow
pointwise decay nature of the linear wave and Klein-Gordon components in
$\mathbb{R}^{1+2}$. We tackle the difficulties by carefully exploiting the
properties of the wave and the Klein-Gordon components, and by relying on the
ghost weight energy estimates to close higher-order energy estimates. This
appears to be the first pointwise decay result and the first scattering result
for the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system in $\mathbb{R}^{1+2}$ without compactness

and differences between small and large collision systems. In order to better
understand the origin of strangeness enhancement in pp new multi-differential
analyses have been performed. The first separates the contribution of soft and
hard processes, such as jets, to strange hadron production through two-particle
correlation techniques. The second exploits the concept of the effective energy
available for particle production in the event, which is estimated by an
anti-correlation with the energy deposited in ALICE's Zero Degree Calorimeters.
The results indicate that strangeness production emerges from the growth of the
underlying event and confirm it is related to the final state multiplicity.

be analytically understood since the Borel representations -- which have been
assumed to be identical for both approaches previously -- differ in the
presence of IR renormalons. This implies that the OPE condensate corrections
are different for both approaches and that the discrepancy may eventually be
reconciled. In the talk we explain the difference and some mathematical aspects

  transformations","Accepted at the Differentiable Programming workshop at NeurIPS 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  JAX and PyTorch are two popular Python autodifferentiation frameworks. JAX is
based around pure functions and functional programming. PyTorch has popularised
the use of an object-oriented (OO) class-based syntax for defining
parameterised functions, such as neural networks. That this seems like a
fundamental difference means current libraries for building parameterised
functions in JAX have either rejected the OO approach entirely (Stax) or have
introduced OO-to-functional transformations, multiple new abstractions, and
been limited in the extent to which they integrate with JAX (Flax, Haiku,
Objax). Either way this OO/functional difference has been a source of tension.
Here, we introduce `Equinox', a small neural network library showing how a
PyTorch-like class-based approach may be admitted without sacrificing JAX-like
functional programming. We provide two main ideas. One: parameterised functions
are themselves represented as `PyTrees', which means that the parameterisation
of a function is transparent to the JAX framework. Two: we filter a PyTree to
isolate just those components that should be treated when transforming (`jit',
`grad' or `vmap'-ing) a higher-order function of a parameterised function --
such as a loss function applied to a model. Overall Equinox resolves the above
tension without introducing any new programmatic abstractions: only PyTrees and
transformations, just as with regular JAX. Equinox is available at

However, higher-order relations cannot be losslessly captured by mere graphs
and hence, extensions thereof viz. hypergraphs are used instead. Measuring
proximity between node pairs in such a setting calls for a revision in the
topological measures of similarity, lest the hypergraph structure remains
under-exploited. We, in this work, propose a multitude of hypergraph-oriented
similarity scores between node-pairs, thereby providing novel solutions to the
link prediction problem. As a part of our proposition, we provide theoretical
formulations to extend graph-topology based scores to hypergraphs. We compare
our scores with graph-based scores (over clique-expansions of hypergraphs into
graphs) from the state-of-the-art. Using a combination of the existing
graph-based and the proposed hypergraph-based similarity scores as features for
a classifier predicts links much better than using the former solely.
Experiments on several real-world datasets and both quantitative as well as
qualitative analyses on the same exhibit the superiority of the proposed
similarity scores over the existing ones.

Learning (RL). Non-linear solvers can produce coordinated constraint satisfying
motions, but often take too long to converge for online application. RL methods
can learn dynamic reactive controllers but require carefully tuned shaping
rewards to produce good gaits and can have trouble discovering precise
coordinated movements. Imitation learning circumvents this problem and has been
used with motion capture data to extract quadruped gaits for flat terrains.
However, it would be costly to acquire motion capture data for a very large
variety of terrains with height differences. In this work, we combine the
advantages of trajectory optimization and learning methods and show that
terrain adaptive controllers can be obtained by training policies to imitate
trajectories that have been planned over procedural terrains by a non-linear

be fine-tuned to dynamically traverse challenging terrains that require precise

reasonably good performance. In general, dependencies between temperature
extremes are better captured than dependencies between precipitation extremes

that CN works very well, and even better in the presence of higher-order

higher than can be achieved from the model. Theoretical justification in simple

control an environment modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that are
optimal with respect to high-level temporal logic specifications. However, they
assume that the MDP model is known a priori. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
algorithms, in contrast, are designed to learn an optimal policy when the
transition probabilities of the MDP are unknown, but require the user to
associate local rewards with transitions. The appeal of high-level temporal
logic specifications has motivated research to develop RL algorithms for
synthesis of policies from specifications. To understand the techniques, and
nuanced variations in their theoretical guarantees, in the growing body of
resulting literature, we develop a formal framework for defining
transformations among RL tasks with different forms of objectives. We define
the notion of a sampling-based reduction to transform a given MDP into another
one which can be simulated even when the transition probabilities of the
original MDP are unknown. We formalize the notions of preservation of optimal
policies, convergence, and robustness of such reductions. We then use our
framework to restate known results, establish new results to fill in some gaps,
and identify open problems. In particular, we show that certain kinds of
reductions from LTL specifications to reward-based ones do not exist, and prove
the non-existence of RL algorithms with PAC-MDP guarantees for safety
specifications.

contextual information in the feature extraction stage. More importantly, by
leveraging the self attention of the transformer, the network can naturally
carry out simultaneous intra-modality and inter-modality fusion, and robustly
capture the latent interactions between RGB and Thermal domains, thereby
significantly improving the performance of multispectral object detection.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies on multiple datasets demonstrate

systems. Saliency is the significant target(s) in the video. The object of
interest is further analyzed for high-level applications. The segregation of
saliency and the background can be made if they exhibit different visual cues.
Therefore, saliency detection is often formulated as background subtraction.
However, saliency detection is challenging. For instance, dynamic background
can result in false positive errors. In another scenario, camouflage will lead
to false negative errors. With moving camera, the captured scenes are even more
complicated to handle. We propose a new framework, called saliency detection
via background model completion (SD-BMC), that comprises of a background
modeler and the deep learning background/foreground segmentation network. The
background modeler generates an initial clean background image from a short
image sequence. Based on the idea of video completion, a good background frame
can be synthesized with the co-existence of changing background and moving
objects. We adopt the background/foreground segmenter, although pre-trained
with a specific video dataset, can also detect saliency in unseen videos. The
background modeler can adjust the background image dynamically when the
background/foreground segmenter output deteriorates during processing of a long
video. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first one to adopt
video completion for background modeling and saliency detection in videos
captured by moving camera. The results, obtained from the PTZ videos, show that
our proposed framework outperforms some deep learning-based background
subtraction models by 11% or more. With more challenging videos, our framework
also outperforms many high ranking background subtraction methods by more than

is a novel implementation of the ODE equilibrium wall model, where the velocity
profile is expressed in the integral form using the constant shear-stress layer
assumption and the integral is evaluated using a spectral quadrature method,
resulting in a local and algebraic (grid-free) formulation. The second model,
which closely follows the integral wall model of Yang et al. (Phys. Fluids 27,

of the wall models is assessed both in a priori and a posteriori settings

a comparable computational cost for the integral wall model, and superior
performance for the spectral implementation over the finite-volume based
approach. Load imbalance among the processors in parallel simulations seems to
severely degrade the parallel efficiency of finite-volume based ODE wall model,
whereas the spectral implementation is remarkably agnostic to these effects.

by living organisms ranging from cells to humans. At the same time, it is
evident that these patterns are not completely random but are results of a
convolution of organisms' sensor-based information processing and motility. The
complexity of the first component is reflected in the statistical
characteristics of trajectories produced by an organism -- when it is, e.g.,
foraging or searching for a mate (or a pathogen) -- and therefore some
knowledge about the component can be obtained by analyzing the trajectories
with the standard toolbox of methods used for random walks. Here we consider
trajectories which appear as the results of a game played by two players on a
finite square lattice. One player wants to survive, i. e., to stay within the
interior of the square, as long as possible while another one wants to reach
the adsorbing boundary. A game starts from the center of the square and every
next movement of the point is determined by independent strategy choices made
by the players. The value of the game is the survival time that is the number
of steps before the adsorption happens. We present the results of a series of
experiments involving both human players and an autonomous agent (bot) and
concentrate on the probability distribution of the survival time. This
distribution indicate that the process we are dealing with is more complex than
the standard random walks.

co-cycle theory (transfer matrix eigenvalue scaling) to consequences of
rational band theory. This reduction links the eigenfunction localization of
the MIT to the chiral edge modes of the Hofstadter Hamiltonian, implying the
localized phase roots in a topological ""bulk-bulk"" correspondence, a
bulk-boundary correspondence between the 1D AAH system (boundary) and its 2D
parent Hamiltonian (bulk). This differentiates quasi-periodic localization from
Anderson localization in disordered systems. Our results are widely applicable
to systems beyond this paradigmatic model.

worldwide. However, residents in different countries showed diverse levels of
Covid-19 awareness during the outbreak and suffered from uneven health impacts.
This study analyzed the global Twitter data from January 1st to June 30th,
2020, seeking to answer two research questions. What are the linguistic and
geographical disparities of public awareness in the Covid-19 outbreak period
reflected on social media? Can the changing pandemic awareness predict the
Covid-19 outbreak? We established a Twitter data mining framework calculating
the Ratio index to quantify and track the awareness. The lag correlations
between awareness and health impacts were examined at global and country
levels. Results show that users presenting the highest Covid-19 awareness were
mainly those tweeting in the official languages of India and Bangladesh. Asian
countries showed more significant disparities in awareness than European
countries, and awareness in the eastern part of Europe was higher than in
central Europe. Finally, the Ratio index could accurately predict global
mortality rate, global case fatality ratio, and country-level mortality rate,
with 21-30, 35-42, and 17 leading days, respectively. This study yields timely
insights into social media use in understanding human behaviors for public
health research.

a general introduction of the challenges with and perceived relevance of AI in
human-welfare centered fields, with an emphasis on the provision of healthcare.
The framework is composed of five principles that measure the perceptions of
acceptability, comfortability, informed consent, privacy, and security patients

two modes: single-target and two-targets. In both cases, we consider the
permittivity and thickness for the wall, as well as the two-dimensional
coordinates of the target's center and permittivity. This means that in the
case of a single target, we estimate five values, whereas, in the case of two
targets, we estimate eight values simultaneously, each of which represents the
mentioned parameters. We discovered that when using deep neural networks to
solve the target locating problem, giving the model more parameters of the
problem increases the location accuracy. As a result, we included two wall
parameters in the problem and discovered that the accuracy of target locating
improves while the wall parameters are estimated. We were able to estimate the
parameters of wall permittivity and thickness, as well as two-dimensional
coordinates and permittivity of targets in single-target and two-target modes
with 99\% accuracy by using a deep neural network model.

degrees of classes of finite unary algebras in arbitrary (not necessarily

where $M = \Omega^*$ is the free monoid of words over the alphabet $\Omega$ and
show that for an arbitrary monoid $M$ (finite or infinite) the class of all
finite $M$-sets has finite small Ramsey degrees. This immediately implies that
the class of all finite $G$-sets, where $G$ is an arbitrary group (finite or
infinite), has finite small Ramsey degrees, and that the class of all finite
unary algebras over an arbitrary (finite or infinite) algebraic language
$\Omega$ has finite small Ramsey degrees. This generalizes some Ramsey-type
results of M.\ Soki\'c concerning finite unary algebras over finite languages
and finite $G$-sets for finite groups~$G$. To do so we develop a completely new
strategy that relies on the fact that right adjoints preserve the Ramsey
property. We then treat $M$-sets as Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras for ""half a
comonad"" and using pre-adjunctions transport the Ramsey properties we are
interested in from the category of finite or countably infinite chains of order
type $\omega$. Moreover, we show that finite objects have finite big Ramsey
degrees in the corresponding cofree structures over countably many generators.

to evaluate older patients (age 65 years and above) functional ability,
physical health, and cognitive wellbeing. The majority of these patients suffer
from multiple chronic conditions and require special attention. Recently,
hospitals utilize various artificial intelligence (AI) systems to improve care
for elderly patients. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to
understand the current use of AI systems, particularly machine learning (ML),
in geriatric clinical care for chronic diseases. Materials and Methods-We
restricted our search to eight databases, namely PubMed, WorldCat, MEDLINE,
ProQuest, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Wiley, and ERIC, to analyze research
articles published in English between January 2010 and June 2019. We focused on
studies that used ML algorithms in the care of geriatrics patients with chronic
conditions. Results-We identified 35 eligible studies and classified in three
groups-psychological disorder (n=22), eye diseases (n=6), and others (n=7).
This review identified the lack of standardized ML evaluation metrics and the
need for data governance specific to health care applications. Conclusion- More
studies and ML standardization tailored to health care applications are
required to confirm whether ML could aid in improving geriatric clinical care.

needed to reduce loss of life and enhance community resilience. In this work, a
novel model development methodology for predicting storm trajectory is proposed
based on two classes of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The RNN models are
trained on input features available in or derived from the HURDAT2 North
Atlantic hurricane database maintained by the National Hurricane Center (NHC).
The models use probabilities of storms passing through any location, computed
from historical data. A detailed analysis of model forecasting error shows that
Many-To-One prediction models are less accurate than Many-To-Many models owing
to compounded error accumulation, with the exception of $6-hr$ predictions, for
which the two types of model perform comparably. Application to 75 or more test
storms in the North Atlantic basin showed that, for short-term forecasting up
to 12 hours, the Many-to-Many RNN storm trajectory prediction models presented
herein are significantly faster than ensemble models used by the NHC, while
leading to errors of comparable magnitude.
