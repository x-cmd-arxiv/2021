  acoustic model","submitted to Interspeech 2022",,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In typical multi-talker speech recognition systems, a neural network-based
acoustic model predicts senone state posteriors for each speaker. These are
later used by a single-talker decoder which is applied on each speaker-specific
output stream separately. In this work, we argue that such a scheme is
sub-optimal and propose a principled solution that decodes all speakers
jointly. We modify the acoustic model to predict joint state posteriors for all
speakers, enabling the network to express uncertainty about the attribution of
parts of the speech signal to the speakers. We employ a joint decoder that can
make use of this uncertainty together with higher-level language information.
For this, we revisit decoding algorithms used in factorial generative models in
early multi-talker speech recognition systems. In contrast with these early
works, we replace the GMM acoustic model with DNN, which provides greater
modeling power and simplifies part of the inference. We demonstrate the
advantage of joint decoding in proof of concept experiments on a mixed-TIDIGITS
dataset.

In this Letter, we use quantum Fisher information (QFI) as an effective probe
to explore the thermal nature of Unruh effect from both local and global
perspectives. By resolving the full dynamics of UDW detector, we find that the
QFI is a time-evolving function of detector's energy gap, Unruh temperature
$T_U$ and particularities of background field, e.g., mass and spacetime
dimensionality. We show that the asymptotic QFI whence detector arrives its
equilibrium is solely determined by $T_U$, demonstrating the global side of
Unruh thermality alluded by the KMS condition. We also show that the local side
of Unruh effect, i.e., the different ways for the detector to approach the same
thermal equilibrium, is encoded in the corresponding time-evolution of the QFI.
In particular, we find that with massless scalar background the QFI has unique
monotonicity in $n=3$ dimensional spacetime, and becomes non-monotonous for
$n\neq3$ models where a local peak value exists at early time and for finite
acceleration, indicating an enhanced precision of estimation on Unruh
temperature at a relative low acceleration can be achieved. Once the field
acquiring mass, the related QFI becomes significantly robust against the Unruh
decoherence in the sense that its local peak sustains for a very long time.
While coupling to a more massive background, the persistence can even be
strengthened and the QFI possesses a larger maximal value. Such robustness of
QFI can surely facilitate any practical quantum estimation task.

existing approaches to reduce EMV travel time employ route optimization and
traffic signal pre-emption without accounting for the coupling between route
these two subproblems. As a result, the planned route often becomes suboptimal.
In addition, these approaches also do not focus on minimizing disruption to the
overall traffic flow. To address these issues, we introduce EMVLight in this
paper. This is a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
simultaneous dynamic routing and traffic signal control. EMVLight extends
Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently update the optimal route for an EMV in
real-time as it travels through the traffic network. Consequently, the
decentralized RL agents learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phase
strategies that reduce EMV travel time and the average travel time of non-EMVs
in the network. We have carried out comprehensive experiments with synthetic

outperforms benchmark transportation engineering techniques as well as existing

our model. The initial orbital distance affects the C/O ratio due to the
different C/O ratios in the gas phase and the solid phase at different orbital
distances. Additionally, the initial orbital distance together with the amount
of accreted planetesimals cause the planet to have sub-solar or super-solar
metallicity. Furthermore, the C/O ratio is affected by the dust grain fraction
and the planetesimal fraction. Planets that accrete most of their heavy
elements through dust grains will have a C/O ratio close to the solar C/O
ratio, while planets that accrete most of their heavy elements from the
planetesimals in the disk will end up with a C/O ratio closer to the C/O ratio
in the solid phase of the disk. By using the C/O ratio and metallicity together
we can put a lower and upper boundary on the initial orbital distance where
super-solar metallicity planets are formed. We show that planetesimals are the
main source for reaching super-solar metallicity planets. On the other hand,
planets that mainly accrete dust grains will show a more solar composition.
Super-solar metallicity planets that initiate their formation farther than the
CO ice line have a C/O ratio closer to the solar value.

graph invariant is based on contraction sequences. More precisely, if one puts
red edges between two vertices representing non-homogeneous subsets, the
twin-width is the minimum integer $d$ such that a contraction sequence keeps
red degree at most $d$. By changing the condition imposed on the trigraphs
(i.e., graphs with some edges being red) and possibly slightly tweaking the
notion of contractions, we show how to characterize the well-established
bounded rank-width, tree-width, linear rank-width, path-width, and proper
minor-closed classes by means of contraction sequences. As an application we
give a transparent alternative proof of the celebrated Courcelle's theorem
(actually of its generalization by Courcelle, Makowsky, and Rotics), that
MSO$_2$ (resp. MSO$_1$) model checking on graphs with bounded tree-width (resp.
bounded rank-width) is fixed-parameter tractable in the size of the input

both in order to refine the landscape between bounded tree-width and bounded

where appearing red edges are oriented away from the newly contracted vertex,
and the mere red out-degree should remain bounded. Surprisingly, classes of
bounded oriented twin-width coincide with those of bounded twin-width. Finally
we examine, from an algorithmic standpoint, the concept of partial contraction
sequences, where, instead of terminating on a single-vertex graph, the sequence
ends when reaching a particular target class.

constant. But many of gene regulatory networks extracted from databases are

is of great significance to elucidate the regulation mechanism over time
points. Result:A qualitative method for representing dynamic gene regulatory
network is developed, called CdtGRN. It adopts the combination of convolutional
neural networks(CNN) and fully connected networks(DNN) as the core mechanism of
prediction. The ionizing radiation Affymetrix dataset (E-MEXP-549) was obtained
at ArrayExpress, by microarray gene expression levels predicting relations
between regulation. CdtGRN is tested against a time-delayed gene regulatory

parametric integral for each individual Feynman diagram. It is based on a
forest formula with linear operators applied to the Feynman amplitudes of
ultraviolet-divergent subdiagrams. The formula is similar to BPHZ; the
difference is only in the linear operators used and in the way of combining

more aligned to the actual object in the image for adversarially robust models

conditions for preserving local energies. It is proven that under these

paper presents a high-performance real-time fine-grain object detection
framework that addresses several obstacles in plant disease detection that
hinder the performance of traditional methods, such as, dense distribution,
irregular morphology, multi-scale object classes, textural similarity, etc. The
proposed model is built on an improved version of the You Only Look Once
(YOLOv4) algorithm. The modified network architecture maximizes both detection
accuracy and speed by including the DenseNet in the back-bone to optimize
feature transfer and reuse, two new residual blocks in the backbone and neck
enhance feature extraction and reduce computing cost; the Spatial Pyramid
Pooling (SPP) enhances receptive field, and a modified Path Aggregation Network
(PANet) preserves fine-grain localized information and improve feature fusion.
Additionally, the use of the Hard-Swish function as the primary activation
improved the model's accuracy due to better nonlinear feature extraction. The
proposed model is tested in detecting four different diseases in tomato plants
under various challenging environments. The model outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art detection models in detection accuracy and speed. At a
detection rate of 70.19 FPS, the proposed model obtained a precision value of
$90.33 \%$, F1-score of $93.64 \%$, and a mean average precision ($mAP$) value
of $96.29 \%$. Current work provides an effective and efficient method for
detecting different plant diseases in complex scenarios that can be extended to
different fruit and crop detection, generic disease detection, and various
automated agricultural detection processes.

orbit the sun on highly elongated, long-period orbits. The stability of
scattered disk objects is primarily controlled by a single parameter - their
perihelion distance. While the existence of a perihelion boundary that
separates chaotic and regular motion of long-period orbits is well established
through numerical experiments, its theoretical basis as well as its semi-major
axis dependence remain poorly understood. In this work, we outline an
analytical model for the dynamics of distant trans-Neptunian objects and show
that the orbital architecture of the scattered disk is shaped by an infinite
chain of $2:j$ resonances with Neptune. The widths of these resonances increase
as the perihelion distance approaches Neptune's semi-major axis, and their
overlap drives chaotic motion. Within the context of this picture, we derive an
analytic criterion for instability of long-period orbits, and demonstrate that
rapid dynamical chaos ensues when the perihelion drops below a critical value,
given by
$q_{\rm{crit}}=a_{\rm{N}}\,\big(\ln((24^2/5)\,(m_{\rm{N}}/M_{\odot})\,(a/a_{\rm{N}})^{5/2})\big)^{1/2}$.
This expression constitutes a boundary between the ""detached"" and actively
""scattering"" sub-populations of distant trans-Neptunian minor bodies.
Additionally, we find that within the stochastic layer, the Lyapunov time of
scattered disk objects approaches the orbital period, and show that the
semi-major axis diffusion coefficient is approximated by
$\mathcal{D}_a\sim(8/(5\,\pi))\,(m_{\rm{N}}/M_{\odot})\,\sqrt{\mathcal{G}\,M_{\odot}\,a_{\rm{N}}}\,\exp\big[-(q/a_{\rm{N}})^2/2\big]$.

verification. The theory of abstract interpretation provides a rich framework
to devise invariant inference algorithms. One of the latest breakthroughs in
invariant inference is property-directed reachability (PDR), but the research
community views PDR and abstract interpretation as mostly unrelated techniques.
  This paper shows that, surprisingly, propositional PDR can be formulated as
an abstract interpretation algorithm in a logical domain. More precisely, we
define a version of PDR, called $\Lambda$-PDR, in which all generalizations of
counterexamples are used to strengthen a frame. In this way, there is no need
to refine frames after their creation, because all the possible supporting
facts are included in advance. We analyze this algorithm using notions from
Bshouty's monotone theory, originally developed in the context of exact
learning. We show that there is an inherent overapproximation between the
algorithm's frames that is related to the monotone theory. We then define a new
abstract domain in which the best abstract transformer performs this
overapproximation, and show that it captures the invariant inference process,
i.e., $\Lambda$-PDR corresponds to Kleene iterations with the best transformer
in this abstract domain. We provide some sufficient conditions for when this
process converges in a small number of iterations, with sometimes an
exponential gap from the number of iterations required for naive exact forward
reachability. These results provide a firm theoretical foundation for the
benefits of how PDR tackles forward reachability.

iterate-to-fixed-point operator. The architecture starts with a standard
layered Network but with added connections from current later to earlier
layers, along with a gate to make them inactive under most circumstances. These
``temporal wormhole'' connections create a shortcut that allows the Neural
Network to use the information available at deeper layers and re-do earlier
computations with modulated inputs. End-to-end training is accomplished by
using appropriate calculations for a numeric iterate-to-fixed-point operator.
In a typical case, where the ``wormhole'' connections are inactive, this is
inexpensive; but when they are active, the network takes a longer time to
settle down, and the gradient calculation is also more laborious, with an
effect similar to making the network deeper. In contrast to the existing
skip-connection concept, this proposed technique enables information to flow up
and down in the network. Furthermore, the flow of information follows a fashion
that seems analogous to the afferent and efferent flow of information through
layers of processing in the brain. We evaluate models that use this novel
mechanism on different long-term dependency tasks. The results are competitive
with other studies, showing that the proposed model contributes significantly
to overcoming traditional deep learning models' vanishing gradient descent
problem. At the same time, the training time is significantly reduced, as the
``easy'' input cases are processed more quickly than ``difficult'' ones.

heavy tails, dependent rows and columns, and singular values with a large
dynamic range. When the structure is given as a possibly non-convex cone $T

be a robust estimator if the effective number of measurements is sufficient,
even in the presence of a model mismatch. In classical compressed sensing with

statistics in the appearance channel and less systematic uncertainties in the

larger matter effect and wider neutrino energy spectrum. For $\alpha_{11}$,
both DUNE and JD+KD give similar bounds. We also show how much the bounds on

Physics. At that conference, he presented in particular the celebrated sticky
bead argument, which was devised to intuitively argue that gravitational waves
must carry energy, if they exist at all. While giving a simple argument in
favor of the existence of gravitational waves, Feynman's thought experiment
paved the way for their detection and stimulated subsequent efforts in building
a practical detecting device. Feynman's contributions were systematically
developed in a letter to Victor Weisskopf, completed in February 1961, as well
as in his Caltech Lectures on Gravitation, delivered in 1962-63. There, a
detailed calculation of the power radiated as gravitational radiation was
performed, using both classical and quantum field theoretical tools, leading to
a derivation of the quadrupole formula and its application to gravitational
radiation by a binary star system. A comparison between the attitudes of
Feynman and of the general relativity community to the problems of
gravitational wave physics is drawn as well.

in the middle of the observation, an initial rise of similar depth and shape
and, after the deep dip, smaller dips of 10% amplitude, which might be periodic
over 18.1-minutes. An eclipse model of the dips yields clump sizes and orbital
radii of 0.5-8 and 5-150 white dwarf radii, respectively. The simultaneous UV
light curve shows no significant variations beyond slow fading. The RGS
spectrum contains both residual shock emission at short wavelengths and the SSS
emission at longer wavelengths. The shock temperature has clearly decreased
compared to an earlier Chandra observation (day 6). The dip spectrum is
dominated by emission lines like in U Sco. The intensity of underlying
blackbody-like emission is much lower with the blackbody normalisation yielding
a similar radius as during the brighter phases, while the lower bolometric
luminosity is ascribed to lower T_eff. This would be inconsistent with clump
occultations unless Compton scattering of the continuum emission reduces the
photon energies to mimic a lower effective temperature. However, systematic
uncertainties are high. The absorption lines in the bright SSS spectrum are
blue-shifted by 870+/-10 km/s before the dip and 900+/-10 km/s, after the dip.
The reproduction of the observed spectrum is astonishing, especially that only
a single absorbing layer is necessary while three such layers are needed to
reproduce the RGS spectrum of V2491 Cyg. The ejecta of V3890 Sgr are thus more
homogeneous than many other SSS spectra indicate. Abundance determination is in
principle possible but highly uncertain. Generally, solar abundances are found
except for N and possibly O higher by an order of magnitude.

naturally explains road-block bypassing and the appearance of steps larger than

starting from the records of his interventions at the Chapel Hill Conference of
1957. As well known, Feynman was concerned about the relation of gravitation
with the rest of physics. Probably for this reason, he promoted an unusual,
field theoretical approach to general relativity, in which, after the
recognition that the interaction must be mediated by the quanta of a massless
spin-$2$ field, Einstein's field equations should follow from the general
properties of Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, plus self-consistency
requirements. Quantum corrections would then be included by considering loop
diagrams. These ideas were further developed by Feynman in his famous lectures
on gravitation, delivered at Caltech in 1962-63, and in a handful of published
papers, where he also introduced some field theoretical tools which were soon
recognized to be of general interest, such as ghosts and the tree theorem. Some
original pieces of Feynman's work on gravity are also present in a set of
unpublished lectures delivered at Hughes Aircraft Company in 1966-67 and
devoted primarily to astrophysics and cosmology. Some comments on the relation

exclusively focus on the submodel where each observed variable is associated
with a distinct source with non-zero variance. This results in the restriction
that no observed variable can deterministically depend on other observed
variables or latent confounders. In this paper, we extend the results on
structure learning by focusing on a subclass of linear SCMs which do not have
this property, i.e., models in which observed variables can be causally
affected by any subset of the sources, and are allowed to be a deterministic
function of other observed variables or latent confounders. This allows for a
more realistic modeling of influence or information propagation in systems. We
focus on the task of causal discovery form observational data generated from a
member of this subclass. We derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions
for unique identifiability of the causal structure. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that gives identifiability results for causal
discovery under both latent confounding and deterministic relationships.
Further, we propose an algorithm for recovering the underlying causal structure

results both on synthetic and real datasets.

technique to shift the light emitted by argon (128 nm) to a longer wavelength

a LAr-TPC was carried out in ProtoDUNE-SP. From February to May 2020, a
gradually increasing amount of xenon was injected to also compensate for the

second it was possible to distinguish the xenon light from the LAr light. The
light shifting mechanism proved to be highly efficient even at small xenon

performance is limited by extensive sparse matrix multiplication (SpMM)
operations involved in computation. While the right sparse matrix storage
format varies across input data, existing deep learning frameworks employ a

investigates how the choice of sparse matrix storage formats affect the GNN

can significantly improve the GNN training performance, but the right format
depends on the input workloads and can change as the GNN iterates over the
input graph. We then develop a predictive model to dynamically choose a sparse

Our model is first trained offline using training matrix samples, and the
trained model can be applied to any input matrix and GNN kernels with SpMM

hypergraph without a Berge copy of $F$ has $o(n^2)$ hyperedges. The smallest
such $r_0$ is called the uniformity threshold of $F$ and is denoted by $th(F)$.
They showed that $th(F)\le R(F,F')$, where $R$ denotes the off-diagonal Ramsey
number and $F'$ is any graph obtained form $F$ by deleting an edge.
  We improve this bound to $th(F)\le R(K_{\chi(F)},F')$, and use the new bound
to determine $th(F)$ exactly for several classes of graphs.

X-ray sources (12 of which are new) within the 1.9 arcmin half-light radius.
Three radio sources in deep ATCA 5 and 9 GHz radio images match with Chandra
sources. We have searched for optical identifications for the expanded Chandra
source list using deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry in B, R, H-alpha, UV,

cataclysmic variables (CVs), 9 chromospherically active binaries (ABs), 3 red
giants (RGs), 3 galaxies (GLXs), and 6 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Three of
the sources are associated with millisecond pulsars (MSPs). As in our previous
study of NGC 6752, we find that the brightest CVs appear to be more centrally
concentrated than are the faintest CVs, although the effect is no longer
statistically significant as a consequence of the inclusion in the faint group
of two intermediate brightness CVs. This possible difference in the radial
distributions of the bright and faint CV groups appears to indicate that mass
segregation has separated them. We note that photometric incompleteness in the
crowded central region of the cluster may also play a role. Both groups of CVs
have an inferred mass above that of the main-sequence turnoff stars. We discuss
the implications for the masses of the CV components.

  Acknowledgements","A&A 658, A11 (2022)","10.1051/0004-6361/202140403",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows originate from the interaction
between the relativistic ejecta and the surrounding medium. Consequently, their
properties depend on several aspects: radiation mechanisms, relativistic shock
micro-physics, circumburst environment, and the structure and geometry of the
relativistic jet. While the standard afterglow model accounts for the overall
spectral and temporal evolution for a number of GRBs, its validity limits
emerge when the data set is particularly rich and constraining, especially in
the radio band.
  Aims. We aimed to model the afterglow of the long GRB160131A (redshift $z =
0.972$), for which we collected a rich, broadband, and accurate data set,
spanning from $6\times10^{8}$ to $7\times10^{17}$ Hz in frequency, and from 330
s to 160 days post burst in time.
  Methods. We modelled the spectral and temporal evolution of this GRB
afterglow through two approaches: the adoption of empirical functions to model
optical/X-rays data set, later assessing their compatibility with the radio
domain; the inclusion of the entire multi-frequency data set simultaneously
through the Python package named sAGa (Software for AfterGlow Analysis), to
come up with an exhaustive and self-consistent description of the
micro-physics, geometry, and dynamics of the afterglow.
  Results. From deep broadband analysis (from radio to X-ray frequencies) of
the afterglow light curves, GRB160131A outflow shows evidence of jetted
emission. Moreover, we observe dust extinction in the optical spectra, and
energy injection in the optical/X-ray data. Radio spectra are characterised by
several peaks, that could be due to either interstellar scintillation (ISS)
effects or a multi-component structure.
  Conclusions. The inclusion of radio data in the broadband set of GRB160131A
makes a self-consistent modelling hardly attainable within the standard model
of GRB afterglows.

take a socio-technical perspective to conceptualize possible robot functions

positively to the idea of introducing a social robot as a technological tool
for learning activities, envisioning differences in usage for teacher-robot and

framework for analyzing human needs, tasks, and outcomes -- illustrated a

discuss the fine-grained robot functions and behaviours conceived by teachers,

parameter, such as the scale factor in super-resolution, the noise level in

studies on image restoration problems have achieved great success due to the
development of deep neural networks, they handle the parameter involved in an
unsophisticated way. Most previous researchers either treat problems with
different parameter levels as independent tasks, and train a specific model for
each parameter level; or simply ignore the parameter, and train a single model
for all parameter levels. The two popular approaches have their own
shortcomings. The former is inefficient in computing and the latter is
ineffective in performance. In this work, we propose a novel system called
functional neural network (FuncNet) to solve a parametric image restoration
problem with a single model. Unlike a plain neural network, the smallest
conceptual element of our FuncNet is no longer a floating-point variable, but a
function of the parameter of the problem. This feature makes it both efficient
and effective for a parametric problem. We apply FuncNet to super-resolution,
image denoising, and JPEG deblocking. The experimental results show the
superiority of our FuncNet on all three parametric image restoration tasks over
the state of the arts.

subject of numerous studies. There are lots of models dealing with the cause of
the effects assigned to dark matter and dark energy. This brief review is
devoted to the very recent theoretical advances in these areas: only to the
advances achieved in the last few years. For example, in section devoted to
particle dark matter we overview recent publications on sterile neutrinos,
self-interacting dark matter, dibarions, dark matter from primordial bubbles,
primordial black holes as dark matter, axions escaping from neutron stars, and
dark and usual matter interacting via the fifth dimension. We also overview the
second flavor of hydrogen atoms: their existence was proven by analyzing atomic
experiments and is also evidenced by the latest astrophysical observations of
the 21 cm spectral line from the early Universe. While discussing non-particle
models of the cause of dark matter effects, we refer to modified Newtonian
dynamics and modifications of the strong equivalence principles. We also
consider exotic compact objects, primordial black holes, and retardation
effects. Finally, we review recent studies on the cause of dark energy effects.
Specifically, we cover two disputes that arose in 2019 and 2020 on whether the
observations of supernovas, previously interpreted as the proof of the
existence of dark energy, could have alternative explanations. Besides, we note
a study of 2021, where dark energy is substituted by a new hypothetical type of
dark matter having a magnetic-type interaction. We also refer to the recent
model of a system of nonrelativistic neutral gravitating particles providing an
alternative explanation of the entire dynamics of the Universe expansion.

the variation in film composition across the substrate, as a function of the
size of the Pt piece. A scanning polar Magneto-Optical-Kerr-Effect system was
used to probe the influence of composition and post-deposition annealing
conditions (temperature and time) on coercivity. In this way the maximum
coercivity achievable for the sputtering system used could be established in a
high throughput fashion. The evolution in coercivity with composition was
correlated with the formation of L10 FePt and changes in its lattice
parameters, as determined by scanning X-ray diffraction. High throughput
coercivity mapping was then carried out on homogeneous Fe-Pt thin films of
different composition treated to different annealing conditions. This study
serves as a step towards the integration of coercive FePt films into

(or ""chains"") largely depends on dynamic interactions between the individual
charged dust grains and the complex electric potential arising from the
distribution of charges within the local plasma environment. Recent studies
have shown that the positive column of the gas discharge plasma in the
Plasmakristall-4 (PK-4) experiment onboard the International Space Station
(ISS) supports the presence of fast-moving ionization waves, which lead to
variations of plasma parameters by up to an order of magnitude from the average
background values. The highly-variable environment resulting from ionization
waves may have interesting implications for the dynamics and self-organization
of dust particles, particularly concerning the formation and stability of dust
chains. Here we investigate the electric potential surrounding dust chains in
the PK-4 by employing a molecular dynamics model of the dust and ions with
boundary conditions supplied by a Particle-in-Cell with Monte Carlo collisions
(PIC-MCC) simulation of the ionization waves. The model is used to examine the
effects of the plasma conditions within different regions of the ionization
wave and compare the resulting dust structure to that obtained by employing the
time-averaged plasma conditions. Comparison between simulated dust chains and
experimental data from the PK-4 shows that the time-averaged plasma conditions
do not accurately reproduce observed results for dust behavior, indicating that
more careful treatment of plasma conditions in the presence of ionization waves
is required. It is further shown that commonly used analytic forms of the
electric potential do not accurately describe the electric potential near
charged dust grains under these plasma conditions.

the fidelity of spin-wave-photon entanglement significantly decreases with the

propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme that can suppress the
additional noise of a temporally-multiplexed QI. The scheme uses an asymmetric
channel to collect the photons coming and retrieving from the
temporally-multiplexed QI. For making comparisons, we also set up a QI that
uses symmetric channel for the photon collections. When the QIs store 14 modes,
the measured Bell parameter S for the QIs using the asymmetric and the
symmetric photon-collection channels are 2.36+/-0.03 and 2.24+/-0.04,
respectively, showing that the QI using the asymmetric channel gives rise to a
3% increase in entanglement fidelity, i.e., a 1.7-fold decrease in the
additional noise, compared with the QI using the symmetric one. On the other
hand, the 14-mode entanglement QIs that use the asymmetric and symmetric

the Sun beyond Neptune, the small bodies of the trans-Neptunian object

sizes have undergone minimal collisional processing, with New Horizons recently
revealing that ~20 km effective diameter body (486958) Arrokoth appears to be a
primordial body, not a collisional fragment. This indicates bodies at these
sizes (and perhaps smaller) retain a record of how they were formed, and are
the most numerous record of that epoch. However, such bodies are impractical to
find by optical surveys due to their very low brightnesses. Their presence can
be inferred from the observed cratering record of Pluto and Charon, and
directly measured by serendipitous stellar occultations. These two methods
produce conflicting results, with occultations measuring roughly ten times the
number of ~km bodies inferred from the cratering record. We use numerical
models to explore how these observations can be reconciled with evolutionary
models of the outer Solar system. We find that models where the initial size of
bodies decreases with increasing semimajor axis of formation, and models where
the surface density of bodies increases beyond the 2:1 mean-motion resonance
with Neptune can produce both sets of observations, though comparison to
various observational tests favours the former mechanism. We discuss how to
evaluate the astrophysical plausibility of these solutions, and conclude
extended serendipitous occultation surveys with broad sky coverage are the most
practical approach.

phase of palladium-silicon in the region 15 to 23 atomic percent (at. \%)
silicon. These pioneering efforts have led to the development of solid
materials that are now known as Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMG). In 2019 we
discovered, computationally, that bulk amorphous Pd becomes magnetic, and so
does porous/amorphous Pd. Puzzled by our results we undertook the study of
several solid binary systems in the Pd-rich zone; in particular, the study of
the glassy metallic alloy $a$-Pd$_{100-c}$Si$_{c}$, for $0 \leq c \leq 22$,
($c$ in at. \%) to see what their topology is, what their electronic properties
are and to inquire about their magnetism. Here we show that this metallic glass
is in fact magnetic in the region $0 \leq c < 15$. Collaterally we present
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ magnetization curves that manifest the net magnetic moment
observed. We also discuss the topology and the position of the first few peaks
of the pair distribution functions, which agrees well with experiment. The BMGs

In the current work, we propose a new velocity field estimation paradigm, which
achieves a synergetic combination of the deep learning method and the
traditional cross-correlation method. Specifically, the deep learning method is
used to optimize and correct a coarse velocity guess to achieve a
super-resolution calculation. And the cross-correlation method provides the
initial velocity field based on a coarse correlation with a large interrogation
window. As a reference, the coarse velocity guess helps with improving the
robustness of the proposed algorithm. This fully convolutional network with
embedded cross-correlation is named as CC-FCN. CC-FCN has two types of input
layers, one is for the particle images, and the other is for the initial
velocity field calculated using cross-correlation with a coarse resolution.
Firstly, two pyramidal modules extract features of particle images and initial
velocity field respectively. Then the fusion module appropriately fuses these
features. Finally, CC-FCN achieves the super-resolution calculation through a
series of deconvolution layers to obtain the single-pixel velocity field. As
the supervised learning strategy is considered, synthetic data sets including
ground-truth fluid motions are generated to train the network parameters.
Synthetic and real experimental PIV data sets are used to test the trained
neural network in terms of accuracy, precision, spatial resolution and
robustness. The test results show that these attributes of CC-FCN are further
improved compared with those of other tested PIV algorithms. The proposed model
could therefore provide competitive and robust estimations for PIV experiments.

more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by
simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),
y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state

requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution.
We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new
parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more
efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths.
Our technique involves conditioning \( A \) with a low-rank correction,
allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied

post-quantum cryptosystems. The key idea of their approach is to apply a
Quantum Linear System (QLS) algorithm to a Macaulay linear system over $\CC$,
which is derived from the Boolean polynomial system. The efficiency of their
algorithm depends on the condition number of the Macaulay matrix. In this
paper, we give a strong lower bound on the condition number as a function of
the Hamming weight of the Boolean solution, and show that in many (if not all)
cases a Grover-based exhaustive search algorithm outperforms their algorithm.
Then, we improve upon Chen and Gao's algorithm by introducing the Boolean
Macaulay linear system over $\CC$ by reducing the original Macaulay linear
system. This improved algorithm could potentially significantly outperform the
brute-force algorithm, when the Hamming weight of the solution is logarithmic
in the number of Boolean variables.

our improved algorithm using a reduction employing the Valiant-Vazirani affine
hashing method, and also extend the result to polynomial systems over $\FF_q$

The framework is able to adjust the receptive field by the dilated convolution
parameters according to the input image, which helps the model to extract more
discriminative features for each local region. Different from most previous
works which use Gaussian kernels to generate the density map as the supervised
information, we propose the self-distilling supervision (SDS) training method.

first effect redirects the propulsion direction while the second one changes

efficient for simplicial complexes such as the Vietoris-Rips complex and

indirect band gap closure, occuring at 24 GPa. A coherent picture is drawn
where n-type doping levels just below the conduction band minimum play a
crucial role in the early metallization transition. Doping levels are also
responsible for the asymmetric Fano line-shape of the E1u infrared-active mode,
which has been here detected and analyzed for the first time in a Transition
Metal Dichalcogenide compound. The pressure evolution of the phonon profile
under pressure shows a symmetrization in the 13-15 GPa pressure range, which
occurs simultaneously with the metallization and confirms the scenario proposed
for the high pressure behaviour of 2H-MoTe2.

(MARL) in this work. In our setting, the global state, action, and reward are
assumed to be fully observable, while the local policy is protected as privacy
by each agent, and thus cannot be shared with others. There is a communication
graph, among which the agents can exchange information with their neighbors.
The agents make individual decisions and cooperate to reach a higher
accumulated reward.
  Towards this end, we first propose a decentralized actor-critic (AC) setting.
Then, the policy evaluation and policy improvement algorithms are designed for
discrete and continuous state-action-space Markov Decision Process (MDP)
respectively. Furthermore, convergence analysis is given under the
discrete-space case, which guarantees that the policy will be reinforced by
alternating between the processes of policy evaluation and policy improvement.

when the activity is sufficiently intense. Recently, it was shown that if the
molecular anchoring at the channel walls is conflicting flows are initiated
even in the zero activity limit. An analytical laminar velocity profile for
this specific configuration was derived within a simplified nematohydrodynamic
model in which the nematic order parameter is a fixed-magnitude unit vector n.
In this study we explore systematically active flows in this confined geometry
with a more general theoretical model that uses a second-rank tensor order
parameter Q to express both the magnitude and orientation of the nematic phase.
The Q-model allows for the presence of defects and biaxial, in addition to
uniaxial, molecular arrangements. Our aim is to provide a unified picture,
beyond the limiting regime explored previously, to serve as a guide for
potential microfluidic applications. We reveal how the nematic-flow coupling is
not only dependent on geometrical constraints but also highly sensitive to
material and flow parameters. We specifically stress the key role played by the
activity and the flow aligning parameter and we show that solutions depend on
two dimensionless parameters. We find that for large values of the activity
parameter the flow is suppressed for contractile particles while is either
sustained or suppressed for extensile particles depending on whether they tend
to align or tumble when subject to shear. We explain these distinct behaviors
by an argument based on the results of the stability analysis applied to
simpler configurations. We finally provide a numerical example of a biaxial
three-dimensional thresholdless active flow for which we show that biaxiality
is specially relevant for a weakly first-order isotropic-nematic phase
transition.

concepts. From a mechanical standpoint, a 3-DOF spherical parallel robot is
used which imitates the human head movement. In what concerns eye movement, a
2-DOF mechanism is attached to the end-effector of the 3-DOF spherical parallel
mechanism. In order to have robust and reliable results for the imitation,
meaningful information should be extracted from the face mesh for obtaining the
pose of a face, i.e., the roll, yaw, and pitch angles. To this end, two methods
are proposed where each of them has its own pros and cons. The first method
consists in resorting to the so-called Mediapipe library which is a machine
learning solution for high-fidelity body pose tracking, introduced by Google.
As the second method, a model is trained by a linear regression model for a
gathered dataset of face pictures in different poses. In addition, a 3-DOF
Agile Eye parallel robot is utilized to show the ability of this robot to be
used as a system which is similar to a human head for performing a 3-DOF
rotational motion pattern. Furthermore, a 3D printed face and a 2-DOF eye
mechanism are fabricated to display the whole system more stylish way.
Experimental tests, which are done based on a ROS platform, demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods for tracking the human head and eye
movement.

nearby (z=0.014) massive radio galaxy NGC6328. The radio core of the galaxy,
PKS B1718-649, is identified as a Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum source with a
compact (2 pc) double radio lobe morphology. We used ALMA CO(2-1) and CO(3-2)
observations at 100 pc resolution to study the gas kinematics up to ~5 kpc from
the galaxy center. While the bulk of the molecular gas is settled in a highly
warped disk, in the inner 300 pc of the disk and along with the orientation of
the radio jet, we identified high-excitation and high-velocity gas that cannot
be attributed to any regular kinematic component based on our detailed 3D
modeling of the ALMA data. The high-velocity dispersion in the gas also
suggests that it is not part of an inflowing, shredding structure. These
results suggest the presence of a molecular outflow of 3 to 8 solar masses per
year. The outflow possibly originated from the interaction of the jet with the
dense interstellar medium, even though the radio emission is detected closer to
the center than the outflow. In this sense, this source resembles NGC1377,
4C31.04 and ESO420-G13, in which the outflows are linked to faint or past jet
activity.

challenging to remove due to its spatially variant amount. This paper presents
an end-to-end deep learning approach for removing defocus blur from a single
image, so as to have an all-in-focus image for consequent vision tasks. First,
a pixel-wise Gaussian kernel mixture (GKM) model is proposed for representing
spatially variant defocus blur kernels in an efficient linear parametric form,
with higher accuracy than existing models. Then, a deep neural network called
GKMNet is developed by unrolling a fixed-point iteration of the GKM-based
deblurring. The GKMNet is built on a lightweight scale-recurrent architecture,
with a scale-recurrent attention module for estimating the mixing coefficients
in GKM for defocus deblurring. Extensive experiments show that the GKMNet not
only noticeably outperforms existing defocus deblurring methods, but also has
its advantages in terms of model complexity and computational efficiency.

sensitivity to biases from extragalactic foregrounds, such as Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(SZ) signals or cosmic infrared background emission. Several methods have been
developed to mitigate these lensing foreground biases, dividing broadly into
multi-frequency cleaning approaches and modifications to the estimator
geometry, but how to optimally combine these methods has not yet been explored
in detail. In this paper, we examine which combination of lensing foreground
mitigation strategies is best able to reduce the impact of foreground
contamination for a Simons-Observatory-like experiment while preserving maximal
signal-to-noise. Although the optimal combination obtained depends on whether
bias- or variance-reduction are prioritized and on whether polarization data is
used, generally, we find that combinations involving both geometric (profile
hardening, source hardening or shear) and multifrequency (symmetric cleaning)
methods perform best. For lensing power spectrum measurements from temperature
(polarization and temperature), our combined estimator methods are able to
reduce the bias to the lensing amplitude below $\sigma/4$ or 0.3% (0.1%), a
factor of 16 (30) lower than the standard QE bias, at a modest signal-to-noise
cost of only 18% (12%). In contrast, single-method foreground-mitigation
approaches struggle to reduce the bias to a negligible level below $\sigma/2$
without incurring a large noise penalty. For upcoming and current experiments,
our combined methods therefore represent a promising approach for making
lensing measurements with negligible foreground bias.

many possible useful applications. Viewing the social network as a graph, the
influence of a set of users can be measured by the number of neighbors located

machine learning (ML) framework, FastCover, to solve kdDSP by learning an
efficient greedy strategy in an unsupervised way. As one critical component of
the framework, we devise a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, graph
reversed attention network (GRAT), that captures the diffusion process among
neighbors. Unlike most heuristic algorithms and concurrent ML frameworks for
combinatorial optimization problems, FastCover determines the entire seed set
from the nodes' scores computed with only one forward propagation of the GNN
and has a time complexity quasi-linear in the graph size. Experiments on
synthetic graphs and real-world social networks demonstrate that FastCover
finds solutions with better or comparable quality rendered by the concurrent
algorithms while achieving a speedup of over 1000x.

physical process, and prediction and control over particle deposit patterns
obtained from sessile droplet evaporation are essential for many industrial
processes such as ink-jet printing or crop-care applications. In this article,
we present a systematic investigation of the effect of surface wettability on
the evaporation dynamics of a particle-laden droplet, including the effect on
the contact line stick-slip, the hydrodynamic flow of the suspended particles
and the resulting particle deposit after evaporation. We tune the wettability
of glass slides using silanisation and quantify the internal flow during the
evaporation by tracking fluorescent tracer particles. We find that the internal
flow shifts from a predominantly outward flow towards the contact line for low
contact angles to an inward flow for large contact angles. Additionally, the
corresponding deposit gradually changes from the typical coffee-ring to a
central stain upon increasing the hydrophobicity of the substrate. Last, we
corroborate these experimental findings with dynamic density functional theory,
modelling the droplet evaporation process and stick-slip behaviour of the
contact line. Our investigation suggests that the wettability of the substrate
can substantially alter hydrodynamic flow within drying droplets and therefore
the resulting particle deposit.

server with data from several clients in a privacy-preserving manner. In FL, a
server sends the model to every client, who then train the model locally and
send it back to the server. The server aggregates the updated models and
repeats the process for several rounds. FL incurs significant communication
costs, in particular when transmitting the updated local models from the
clients back to the server. Recently proposed algorithms quantize the model
parameters to efficiently compress FL communication. These algorithms typically
have a quantization level that controls the compression factor. We find that
dynamic adaptations of the quantization level can boost compression without
sacrificing model quality. First, we introduce a time-adaptive quantization
algorithm that increases the quantization level as training progresses. Second,
we introduce a client-adaptive quantization algorithm that assigns each
individual client the optimal quantization level at every round. Finally, we
combine both algorithms into DAdaQuant, the doubly-adaptive quantization
algorithm. Our experiments show that DAdaQuant consistently improves
client$\rightarrow$server compression, outperforming the strongest non-adaptive

simulations of the atmospheric escape of hot Jupiters with including the wind

that the planetary outflow is shaped by the balance between its thermal
pressure and the ram pressure of the stellar wind. We use the simulation
outputs to calculate the Lyman-$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ transit signatures.
Strong winds can confine the outflow and decrease the Lyman-$\alpha$ transit
depth. Contrastingly, the wind effect on H$\alpha$ is weak because of the small
contribution from the uppermost atmosphere of the planet. Observing both of the
lines is important to understand the effect of the UV radiation and wind from

Schwinger terms present in quantum field theory. We work in Hamiltonian
framework where Eulerian dynamical variables obey an anomalous algebra (with
Schwinger terms) that is inherited from modified Poisson brackets, with Berry
curvature corrections, among Lagrangian discrete coordinates. The divergence
anomaly appears in the Hamiltonian equations of motion. A generalized form of
fluid velocity field can be identified with the ""anomalous velocity"" of Bloch
band electrons appearing in quantum Hall effect in condensed matter physics. We

efficient quantum mechanical computational methodologies. In this paper the
two-component density functional theory, TC-DFT, as a first principles method,
which treats electrons and the positive muon on an equal footing as quantum

of this theory, apart from the electronic exchange-correlation functional, is
the electron-positive muon correlation functional which is foreign to the
purely electronic DFT. A Wigner-type local electron-positive muon correlation
functional, termed e$\mu$c-1, is proposed in this paper and its capability is
demonstrated through its computational application to a benchmark set of muonic
organic molecules. The TC-DFT equations containing e$\mu$c-1 are not only
capable of predicting the muon$'$s binding site correctly but they also
reproduce muon$'$s zero-point vibrational energies and the muonic densities
much more accurately than the TC-DFT equations lacking e$\mu$c-1. Thus, this
study set the stage for developing accurate electron-positive muon functionals,
which can be used within the context of the TC-DFT to elucidate the intricate
interaction of the positive muon with complex molecular systems.

the electromagnetic field was discovered before photons, while the electron
itself was discovered first as a particle, before it became clear that it must
also be treated as a wave and therefore as an excitation of the underlying
electron field. We illustrate the fact that the vector potential ought to play
a fundamental role classically using the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This effect is
considered as the strongest argument for the role the vector potential plays in
quantum physics, however, here we offer a fully classical account of it. This
is a consequence of the fact that any account, be it classical or quantum, must
involve the vector potential in order to preserve the local nature of the

modeled through repeated games. In repeated games, Press and Dyson discovered
zero-determinant (ZD) strategies that enforce a special relationship between
two players. This special relationship implies that a ZD player can
unilaterally impose a linear payoff relationship to the opponent regardless of
the opponent's strategies. A ZD player also has a property that can lead the
opponent to an unconditional cooperation if the opponent tries to improve its
payoff. This property has been mathematically confirmed by Chen and Zinger.
Humans often underestimate a payoff obtained in the future. However, such
discounting was not considered in their analysis. Here, we mathematically
explored whether a ZD player can lead the opponent to an unconditional
cooperation even if a discount factor is incorporated. Specifically, we
represented the expected payoff with a discount factor as the form of
determinants and calculated whether the values obtained by partially
differentiating each factor in the strategy vector become positive. As a
result, we proved that the strategy vector ends up as an unconditional
cooperation even when starting from any initial strategy. This result was
confirmed through numerical calculations. We extended the applicability of ZD
strategies to real world problems.

predicative and constructive, we respectively mean that we do not assume
Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms or excluded middle. Our work
complements existing work on predicative mathematics by exploring what cannot
be done predicatively in univalent foundations. Our first main result is that
nontrivial (directed or bounded) complete posets are necessarily large. That
is, if such a nontrivial poset is small, then weak propositional resizing
holds. It is possible to derive full propositional resizing if we strengthen
nontriviality to positivity. The distinction between nontriviality and
positivity is analogous to the distinction between nonemptiness and
inhabitedness. Moreover, we prove that locally small, nontrivial (directed or
bounded) complete posets necessarily lack decidable equality. We prove our
results for a general class of posets, which includes e.g. directed complete
posets, bounded complete posets, sup-lattices and frames. Secondly, the fact
that these nontrivial posets are necessarily large has the important
consequence that Tarski's theorem (and similar results) cannot be applied in
nontrivial instances. Furthermore, we explain that generalizations of Tarski's
theorem that allow for large structures are provably false by showing that the
ordinal of ordinals in a univalent universe has small suprema in the presence
of set quotients. The latter also leads us to investigate the
inter-definability and interaction of type universes of propositional
truncations and set quotients, as well as a set replacement principle. Thirdly,
we clarify, in our predicative setting, the relation between the traditional
definition of sup-lattice that requires suprema for all subsets and our
definition that asks for suprema of all small families.

hand, in the dense regime of parameters, where the list contains more numbers

significantly improved by Wagner's $k$-tree algorithm. Such algorithms for
$k$-SUM in the dense regime have many applications, notably in cryptanalysis.
  In this paper, assuming the average-case $k$-SUM conjecture, we prove that
known algorithms are essentially optimal for $k= 3,4,5$. For $k>5$, we prove
the optimality of the $k$-tree algorithm for a limited range of parameters. We
also prove similar results for $k$-XOR, where the sum is replaced with

$k$-SUM which has a few solutions, produces from it many instances in the dense

hope that a solution to a dense instance also solves the original problem. We
deal with potentially malicious oracles (that repeatedly output correlated
useless solutions) by an obfuscation process that adds noise to the dense
instances. Using discrete Fourier analysis, we show that the obfuscation
eliminates correlations among the oracle's solutions, even though its inputs

of Hb 12, beginning with the first spectra taken by Aller (1951) in 1945. We
have detected a systematic increase in the relative intensities of the nebular
[O III] $\lambda$4959 and $\lambda$5007 lines and a decrease in the relative
intensity of the auroral [O III] $\lambda$4363 line, which has led to an
increase in the observed flux ratio $F(\lambda 4959+\lambda 5007)/F(\lambda
4363)$ by a factor of $\sim$4 from 1945 to the present time. The [O III]/[O II]
line ratio $F(\lambda 4363)/F(\lambda 3727+ \lambda3729)$ remains constant,
suggesting that the degree of ionization, on average, for the nebula is
invariable. The temperature of the exciting star has been estimated to be
$T\approx41~000$ K. We conclude that a decrease in the electron temperature
and, possibly, the electron density in the [O III] line formation region is
mainly responsible for the spectroscopic variability.

holes in active galactic nuclei. We study a simplified model of outflow of
electrically charged particles from the inner region of an accretion disk
around a spinning (Kerr) black hole immersed in a large-scale magnetic field.
In particular, we consider a non-axisymmetric magnetosphere where the field is
misaligned with the rotation axis. In this contribution we extend our previous
analysis of acceleration of jet-like trajectories of particles escaping from
bound circular orbits around a black hole. While we have previously assumed the
initial setup of prograde (co-rotating) orbits, here we relax this assumption
and we also consider retrograde (counter-rotating) motion. We show that the
effect of counter-rotation may considerably increase the probability of escape
from the system, and it allows more efficient acceleration of escaping
particles to slightly higher energies compared to the co-rotating disk.

been inquired, through gravitationally raised friction emanated from the
nonminimal coupling between gravity and field derivative setup. Setting a
two-parted exponential function of inflaton field as coupling parameter, and
fine-tuning of four parameter cases of our model, we could sufficiently slow
down the inflaton owing to high friction during an ultra slow-roll phase. This
empowers us to achieve enough enhancement in the amplitude of curvature
perturbations power spectra, via numerical solving of Mukhanov-Sasaki equation.
Thereafter, we illustrate the generation of four PBHs with disparate masses in
RD era, corresponding to our four parameter cases. Two specimens of these PBHs
with stellar ${\cal O}(10)M_{\odot}$ and earth ${\cal O}(10^{-6})M_{\odot}$
masses can be appropriate to explicate the LIGO-VIRGO events, and the
ultrashort-timescale microlensing events in OGLE data, respectively. Another
two cases of PBHs have asteroid masses around ${\cal O}(10^{-13})M_{\odot}$ and
${\cal O}(10^{-15})M_{\odot}$ with abundance of $96\%$ and $95\%$ of the Dark
Matter (DM) content of the universe. Furthermore, we scrutinize the induced
Gravitational Waves (GWs) ensued from PBHs production in our model.
Subsequently, we elucidate that their contemporary density parameter spectra
$(\Omega_{\rm GW_0})$ for all predicted cases have acmes which lie in the
sensitivity scopes of the GWs detectors, thereupon the verity of our
conclusions can be verified in view of deduced data from these detectors. At
length, our numerical outcomes exhibit a power-law behavior for the spectra of
$\Omega_{\rm GW_0}$ with respect to frequency as $\Omega_{\rm GW_0} (f) \sim
(f/f_c)^{n} $ in the proximity of acmes position. As well, in the infrared
regime $f\ll f_{c}$, the log-reliant form of power index as $n=3-2/\ln(f_c/f)$

to reveal the fundamental theoretical capacity bound of communication systems.
In this paper, we propose analyzing schemes for the performance limit between
continuous transceivers. Specifically, we model the communication process
between two continuous regions by random fields. Then, for the white noise
model, we use Mercer expansion to derive the mutual information between the
source and the destination. For the close-form expression, an analytic method
is introduced based on autocorrelation functions with rational spectrum.
Moreover, the Fredholm determinant is used for the general autocorrelation
functions to provide the numerical calculation scheme. Further works extend the
white noise model to colored noise and discuss the mutual information under it.
Finally, we build an ideal model with infinite-length source and destination
which shows a strong correpsondence with the time-domain model in classical
information theory. The mutual information and the capacity are derived through
the spatial spectral density.

scales of $k_{\rm max}= 0.5 \ h/{\rm Mpc}$ and $r_{\rm min}= 4 \ {\rm Mpc}/h$.
While the linear bias parameter is measured with 0.01% precision, other bias
parameters are determined with considerably weaker constraints and sometimes
bimodal posterior distributions. We compare our fiducial model with lower
dimensional models where the higher-order bias parameters are fixed at their
co-evolution values and find that leaving these parameters free provides
significant improvements in our ability to model small scale information. We
also compare bias parameters for galaxy samples defined using different
magnitude bands and find agreement between samples containing equal numbers of
galaxies. Finally, we compare bias parameters between Fourier space and
configuration space and find moderate tension between the two approaches.
Although our model is often unable to fit the CosmoDC2 galaxy samples within
the 0.1% precision of our measurements, our results suggest that the hybrid-PT

intra-unit cell (IUC) magnetism, preserving the lattice translational (LT)

incipient charge density wave breaking the LT symmetry upon cooling. However,
none of these states can (alone) account for the partial gapping of the Fermi

global stochastic search algorithms. These optimizations are computationally
expensive due to the large number of multiphase flow simulations that must be
conducted. In this work, we present an optimization framework in which these
simulations are performed with low-fidelity (LF) models. These LF models are
constructed from the underlying high-fidelity (HF) geomodel using a global
transmissibility upscaling procedure. Tree-based machine-learning methods,
specifically random forest and light gradient boosting machine, are applied to
estimate the error in objective function value (in this case net present value,
NPV) associated with the LF models. In the offline (preprocessing) step,
preliminary optimizations are performed using LF models, and a clustering
procedure is applied to select a representative set of 100--150 well
configurations to use for training. HF simulation is then performed for these
configurations, and the tree-based models are trained using an appropriate set
of features. In the online (runtime) step, optimization with LF models, with
the machine-learning correction, is conducted. Differential evolution is used
for all optimizations. Results are presented for two example cases involving
the placement of vertical wells in 3D bimodal channelized geomodels. We compare
the performance of our procedure to optimization using HF models. In the first
case, 25 optimization runs are performed with both approaches. Our method
provides an overall speedup factor of 46 relative to optimization using HF
models, with the best-case NPV within 1% of the HF result. In the second case
fewer HF optimization runs are conducted (consistent with actual practice), and
the overall speedup factor with our approach is about 8. In this case, the
best-case NPV from our procedure exceeds the HF result by 3.8%

and cognition. Increasing evidence indicates that induction mechanisms play a
crucial role in triggering emotions by simulating the sensations required for
an experimental design. Over the years, many reviews have evaluated a passive
elicitation mechanism where the user is an observer, ignoring the importance of
self-relevance in emotional experience. So, in response to the gap in the
literature, this study intends to explore the possibility of using Virtual
Reality (VR) as an active mechanism for emotion induction. Furthermore, for the
success and quality of research settings, VR must select the appropriate
material to effectively evoke emotions. Therefore, in the present review, we
evaluated to what extent VR visual and audio-visual stimuli, games, and tasks,
and 360-degree panoramas and videos can elicit emotions based on the current
literature. Further, we present public datasets generated by VR and
emotion-sensing interfaces that can be used in VR based research. The
conclusions of this survey reveal that VR has a great potential to evoke
emotions effectively and naturally by generating motivational and empathy
mechanisms which makes it an ecologically valid paradigm to study emotions.

Lie algebras of maximal class with 1-dimensional homogeneous components:
$\mathfrak{m}_0$, $L_1$ and $\mathfrak{m}_2$. In this paper, we studied their
biderivations by considering the embedded mapping to derivation algebras. Then
we determined commuting mappings on these algebras as an application of
biderivations. Finally,
  local and 2-local derivations for these three algebras were characterized as
the given gradings.

under a dynamic environment. We develop a system model for formal modelling of
drone services in a skyway network. The composition process is accomplished in
two phases, i.e., computing top-k compositions and extending and ranking top-k
compositions using probabilistic wait and recharge times under congestion
conditions. We propose a top-k composition algorithm to compute the best
service composition plan meeting user's requirements. A set of experiments with
a real dataset is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

that all components of a complex system are inter-related and interdependent in
some way and the behavior of that system depends on these independences. A
health care system as portrayed in this article is widespread and complex. This
encompasses not only hospitals but also governing bodies like the FDA,
technologies such as AI, biomedical devices, Cloud computing and many more. The
interactions between all these components govern the behavior and existence of
the overall healthcare system. In this paper, we focus on the interaction of
artificial intelligence, care providers and policymakers and analyze using
