spectral distortions in the isotropic component of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). Deviations from a pure blackbody spectrum are expected at low
level ($<$ 1 ppm) due to several astrophysical and cosmological phenomena, and
promise to provide important independent information on the early and late
phases of the universe. They have not been detected yet, due to the extreme
accuracy required, the best upper limits being still those from the COBE-FIRAS
mission. COSMO is based on a cryogenic differential Fourier Transform
Spectrometer, measuring the spectral brightness difference between the sky and
an accurate cryogenic blackbody. The first implementation of COSMO, funded by
the Italian PRIN and PNRA programs, will operate from the Concordia station at
Dome-C, in Antarctica, and will take advantage of a fast sky-dip technique to
get rid of atmospheric emission and its fluctuations, separating them from the
monopole component of the sky brightness. Here we describe the instrument
design, its capabilities, the current status. We also discuss its subsequent
implementation in a balloon-flight, which has been studied within the COSMOS

tasks to further refine imperfect ranking results, but it often has low
interaction efficiency. The active learning (AL) technique addresses this
problem by selecting valuable feedback candidates. However, mainstream AL
methods require an initial labeled set for a cold start and are often
computationally complex to solve. Therefore, they cannot fully satisfy the
requirements for online RF in interactive INS tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a confidence-aware active feedback method (CAAF) that is specifically
designed for online RF in interactive INS tasks. Inspired by the explicit
difficulty modeling scheme in self-paced learning, CAAF utilizes a pairwise
manifold ranking loss to evaluate the ranking confidence of each unlabeled
sample. The ranking confidence improves not only the interaction efficiency by
indicating valuable feedback candidates but also the ranking quality by
modulating the diffusion weights in manifold ranking. In addition, we design
two acceleration strategies, an approximate optimization scheme and a top-K
search scheme, to reduce the computational complexity of CAAF. Extensive
experiments on both image INS tasks and video INS tasks searching for
buildings, landscapes, persons, and human behaviors demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, in the real-world, large-scale
video INS task of NIST TRECVID 2021, CAAF uses 25% fewer feedback samples to
achieve a performance that is nearly equivalent to the champion solution.
Moreover, with the same number of feedback samples, CAAF's mAP is 51.9%,
significantly surpassing the champion solution by 5.9%. Code is available at

paradigm has received significant interest recently from the research
community, the problem of selecting the relevant clients w.r.t. the central
server's learning objective is under-explored. We refer to these problems as
Federated Relevant Client Selection (FRCS). Because the server doesn't have
explicit control over the nature of data possessed by each client, the problem
of selecting relevant clients is significantly complex in FL settings. In this
paper, we resolve important and related FRCS problems viz., selecting clients
with relevant data, detecting clients that possess data relevant to a
particular target label, and rectifying corrupted data samples of individual
clients. We follow a principled approach to address the above FRCS problems and
develop a new federated learning method using the Shapley value concept from
cooperative game theory. Towards this end, we propose a cooperative game
involving the gradients shared by the clients. Using this game, we compute
Shapley values of clients and then present Shapley value based Federated
Averaging (S-FedAvg) algorithm that empowers the server to select relevant
clients with high probability. S-FedAvg turns out to be critical in designing
specific algorithms to address the FRCS problems. We finally conduct a thorough

Hence, it makes a more substantial challenge to design stabilizing controllers.
If physical parameters on mathematical models have miscalibrations due to
uncertainty in identifying and modeling processes, designed controllers could
perform poorly or even result in unstable responses. Moreover, these parameters
can certainly change-over-time due to operation and environmental conditions.
In that respect, analogous to a living organism modifying its behavior in
response to novel conditions, adapting/updating system parameters, such as
spring constant, to compensate for modeling errors could provide the advantage
of constructing a stable gait level controller without needing ""exact""
dynamical parameter values. This paper presents an online, model-based adaptive
control approach for an underactuated planar hexapod robot's pronking behavior

that the adaptive control policy is robust to high levels of parameter

material due to its promising physical properties. Moreover, because of the
existence of intrinsic vacancies, TiO demonstrates memristive properties. To
use these compounds in active region for memristive switching, the
investigation of the dynamical stability of these compounds is of importance.
Therefore, the structural, electronic, and dynamical properties of TiO in two
different phases, namely cubic and monoclinic structures along with vacancies,
are debated from the framework of density functional theory. The structural
calculations show that the vacancies have quite an impact on the bulk modulus
of these compounds. The electronic band structure remarks that these structures
are metallic. In addition, there is an energy gap between O-2p and Ti-3d states
in these compounds below the Fermi level that can be altered via vacancy
concentration. The phonon calculations reveal that monoclinic structure is
dynamically stable whereas the cubic phase is unstable at room temperature.
Considering ~12.5% of both Ti and O vacancy concentration, eliminate the
imaginary modes for the cubic structure. Moreover, the vacancy-free cubic
structure can be stable above ~ 10 GPa applied pressure, which is consistent
with the experiment. Additionally, phonon dispersion curves of TiOx compounds
suggest that these materials are not favorable for thermal conductivity. The
pressure phase transition results indicate the transition from monoclinic to
vacant cubic TiO at ~8 GPa, whereas the monoclinic to vacancy-free cubic TiO
transition occurs at ~ 44 GPa, which are in a good agreement with the recent
reports. Therefore, it can be concluded that engineering of the vacancy sites
and their concentration in TiO phases can play an important role in applying
them in technological applications.

optimization. The exchange of ideas between these fields has worked both ways,
with machine learning building on standard optimization procedures such as
gradient descent, as well as with new directions in the optimization theory
stemming from machine learning applications. In this thesis, we discuss new
developments in optimization inspired by the needs and practice of machine
learning, federated learning, and data science. In particular, we consider
seven key challenges of mathematical optimization and develop a solution to
each.
  Our first contribution is the resolution of a key open problem in Federated
Learning: we establish the first theoretical guarantees for the famous Local
SGD algorithm in the heterogeneous data regime. As the second challenge, we
close the gap between the upper and lower bounds for the theory of two
algorithms known as Random Reshuffling (RR) and Shuffle-Once that are widely
used in practice, and set as the default data selection strategies for SGD in
modern machine learning software. Our third contribution can be seen as a
combination of our new theory for proximal RR and Local SGD yielding a new
algorithm, which we call FedRR. Unlike Local SGD, FedRR can provably beat
gradient descent in communication complexity in the heterogeneous data regime.
The fourth challenge is related to the class of adaptive methods. In
particular, we present the first parameter-free stepsize rule for gradient
descent that provably works for any locally smooth convex objective. The fifth
challenge is the development of an algorithm for distributed optimization with
quantized updates that preserves linear convergence of gradient descent.
Finally, in our sixth and seventh challenges, we develop new VR mechanisms
applicable to the non-smooth setting based on proximal operators.

that enables the extraction biologically meaningful relations from this
high-dimensional data. We illustrate these ideas using a large-scale network
model of the Macaque primary visual cortex. Of the 10-20 model parameters, we
identify 7 that are especially poorly constrained, and use the MF algorithm in
(1) to discover the firing rate contours in this 7D parameter cube. Defining a
""biologically plausible"" region to consist of parameters that exhibit
spontaneous Excitatory and Inhibitory firing rates compatible with experimental
values, we find that this region is a slightly thickened codimension-1
submanifold. An implication of this finding is that while plausible regimes
depend sensitively on parameters, they are also robust and flexible provided
one compensates appropriately when parameters are varied. Our organizing
principle for conceptualizing parameter dependence is to focus on certain 2D
parameter planes that govern lateral inhibition: Intersecting these planes with
the biologically plausible region leads to very simple geometric structures
which, when suitably scaled, have a universal character independent of where
the intersections are taken. In addition to elucidating the geometry of the
plausible region, this invariance suggests useful approximate scaling
relations. Our study offers, for the first time, a complete characterization of

change in the system's external conditions or parameters, commonly occur in a
wide variety of disciplines, from the biological and social sciences to
physics. Statistical physics first confronted the problem of emergent phenomena
such as critical transitions in the 1800s and 1900s, culminating in the theory
of phase transitions. However, although phase transitions show a strong
resemblance to critical transitions, the theoretical connections between the
two sets of phenomena are tenuous at best, and it would be advantageous to make
them more concrete in order to take advantage of the theoretical methods
developed by physicists to study phase transitions. Here we attempt to
explicitly connect the theory of critical transitions to phase transitions in
physics. We initially find something paradoxical, that many critical
transitions closely resemble first-order phase transitions, but that many of
the early warning indicators developed to anticipate critical transitions, such
as critical slowing down or increasing spatial correlations, occur instead in
second-order phase transitions. We attempt to reconcile these disparities by
making the connection with other phenomena associated with first-order phase
transitions, such as spinodal instabilities and metastable states.

STVG theory as a good theory for explaining black holes both on local and
global scales affect the Hawking effect. Based on semiclassical approximation,
we follow Hamilton-Jacobi and Parikh-Wilczek tunneling methods, respectively
with and without back-reaction effects. We find out that back-reaction effects
make a correlation between the emission modes in Parikh-Wilczek tunneling
formalism, which can address the information paradox. We obtain the
corresponding Hawking-like temperature as a function of inverse powers of
apparent horizons radiuses of the cosmological black hole in STVG theory. We
analyze the influence of the STVG parameter associated with a deviation of the
STVG theory from General Theory of Relativity (GR) on both apparent horizons

increasing the STVG parameter results in appearing the Hawking-like temperature

their ejecta must be layered to some degree. Such an ejecta structure has been
argued as inconsistent with the well-mixed composition predicted by pure
deflagrations. Based on explosion models, we create toy models in which the
ejecta are artificially stratified and progressively mixed until a uniform
composition is obtained. We find that models that are heavily mixed, containing
burned and unburned material at all velocities, produce reasonably good
agreement with SN 2012Z, for which a layered structure has been suggested. We
also discuss how existing ejecta compositions determined for type Iax
supernovae do not necessarily contradict pure deflagration models and may be
consistent with a steeper density profile. We investigate previous claims that
differences in line profile shapes may be due to strong blending, by presenting
a series of models with different plasma states. These models indicate that
blending could indeed explain differences in the observed profiles.
Alternatively, stratification could also explain such differences, however all
of our models indicate that this does not necessarily require stratification in
abundance. Sufficient stratification in ionisation state can be achieved even
for a well-mixed model. Based on our analysis, we demonstrate that there is
insufficient evidence to suggest the ejecta of type Iax supernovae must be

extracting timely and relevant security threats, which are fed to the threat
intelligence systems for better performance. However, with possible campaigns
spreading false security threats, these systems can become vulnerable to

misinformation about cybersecurity and privacy threats on social media,
focusing on two topics with different types of misinformation: phishing
websites and Zoom's security & privacy threats. We developed a framework for
detecting inaccurate phishing claims on Twitter. Using this framework, we could
label about 9% of URLs and 22% of phishing reports as misinformation. We also
proposed another framework for detecting misinformation related to Zoom's

great performance with more than 98% accuracy. Employing these classifiers on

studied the characteristics of misinformation posts, their authors, and their

X-ray shock front at the position of the radio phoenix, which further
strengthens the scenario that radio phoenix traces old plasma that gets lit up
when compressed by shock passage. We further analyze the thermodynamic
structure of the cluster in detail. We create temperature maps of A1914 using
three different techniques, Adaptive Circular Binning (ACB), Weighted Voronoi
Tessellations (WVT), and Contour binning (Contbin) method. These thermodynamic

process, agents communicate their value and policy parameters to their
neighbours, diffusing the information across a network of agents with no need
for a central station. Each agent can only access data from its local task, but
aims to learn a common policy that performs well for the whole set of tasks.
The architecture is scalable, since the computational and communication cost
per agent depends on the number of neighbours rather than the overall number of
agents. We derive Diff-DAC from duality theory and provide novel insights into
the actor-critic framework, showing that it is actually an instance of the dual
ascent method. We prove almost sure convergence of Diff-DAC to a common policy
under general assumptions that hold even for deep-neural network
approximations. For more restrictive assumptions, we also prove that this
common policy is a stationary point of an approximation of the original
problem. Numerical results on multitask extensions of common continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that Diff-DAC stabilises learning and has a regularising
effect that induces higher performance and better generalisation properties
than previous architectures.

elliptical vibration cutting (EVC) of silicon and identifies the practical
process window for ductile-regime cutting. EVC has been reported to increase
the critical depth of ductile-regime cutting of silicon. This study
demonstrates that the enhanced ductile cutting performance, however, is only
optimal in a carefully-determined process window. The vibration amplitudes and
nominal cutting velocity have significant impacts on the ductile-to-brittle
transition behaviors. Systematic experiments covering a wide span of vibration
amplitudes and cutting velocity have been conducted to investigate their
effects. Two quantitative performance indices, the critical depth and ductile
ratio, are utilized to analyze cutting performance by considering two unique
characteristics of elliptical vibration cutting, i.e., the time-varying
undeformed chip thickness and effective cutting direction angle. The results
show that there exists a lower bound for the nominal cutting velocity to ensure
the ductile-regime material removal, besides the well-known upper bound.
Besides, the increases of vibration amplitudes in both the cutting and
depth-of-cut (DOC) directions first enhance but then deteriorate the cutting
performance. Based on the theoretical analysis and experimental results, the
optimal process parameters have been recommended for the elliptical vibration

$a, b, c \in [k]$, following edges of colors $a, b, c, a, b, c$ from $v$ brings
us back to $v$. We give one-to-one correspondences between (1) Sidon sets of

1 and index $n$ in the lattice $A_{k}$, and (3) colored $(k +

obstructions to the existence of Sidon sets, and in particular, planar

data commonly exhibit complex distributional features such as zero-inflation,

such as MCMC typically are needed for posterior inference. This paper
introduces a Bayesian modeling and algorithmic framework that enables
semiparametric regression analysis for discrete data with Monte Carlo (not
MCMC) sampling. The proposed approach pairs a nonparametric marginal model with
a latent linear regression model to encourage both flexibility and
interpretability, and delivers posterior consistency even under model
misspecification. For a parametric or large-sample approximation of this model,
we identify a class of conjugate priors with (pseudo) closed-form posteriors.
All posterior and predictive distributions are available analytically or via
direct Monte Carlo sampling. These tools are broadly useful for linear
regression, nonlinear models via basis expansions, and variable selection with
discrete data. Simulation studies demonstrate significant advantages in
computing, prediction, estimation, and selection relative to existing
alternatives. This novel approach is applied successfully to self-reported
mental health data that exhibit zero-inflation, overdispersion, boundedness,

have been proposed. A very recent defense strategy for detecting adversarial
examples, that has been shown to be robust to current attacks, is to check for
intrinsic context consistencies in the input data, where context refers to
various relationships (e.g., object-to-object co-occurrence relationships) in
images. In this paper, we show that even context consistency checks can be
brittle to properly crafted adversarial examples and to the best of our

framework to generate examples that subvert such defenses, namely, Adversarial
attacks against object Detection that evade Context consistency checks (ADC).
In ADC, we formulate a joint optimization problem which has two attack goals,
viz., (i) fooling the object detector and (ii) evading the context consistency
check system, at the same time. Experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO
datasets show that examples generated with ADC fool the object detector with a
success rate of over 85% in most cases, and at the same time evade the recently

China and an artistic carrier of thought, culture, spirit and emotion. However,
due to the strict rules of ancient poetry, it is very difficult to write poetry
by machine. This paper proposes an automatic generation method of Chinese
traditional poetry based on deep learning technology, which extracts keywords
from each poem and matches them with the previous text to make the poem conform
to the theme, and when a user inputs a paragraph of text, the machine obtains
the theme and generates poem sentence by sentence. Using the classic word2vec
model as the preprocessing model, the Chinese characters which are not
understood by the computer are transformed into matrix for processing.
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory is used as the neural network model to
generate Chinese characters one by one and make the meaning of Chinese
characters as accurate as possible. At the same time, TF-IDF and TextRank are
used to extract keywords. Using the attention mechanism based encoding-decoding
model, we can solve practical problems by transforming the model, and
strengthen the important information of long-distance information, so as to
grasp the key points without losing important information. In the aspect of
emotion judgment, Long Short-Term Memory network is used. The final result
shows that it can get good poetry outputs according to the user input text.

use it to construct a semi-supervised multiple machine learning (SMMAL)

with B-spline regression under low-dimensional smooth models. We develop the
adaptive sparsity/model doubly robust estimation under high-dimensional

promising technology for 6G due to its potential/ability to significantly
enhance energy- and spectrum-efficiency. To this end, it is crucial to adjust
the phases of reflecting elements of the IRS, and most of the research works
focus on how to optimize/quantize the phase for different optimization
objectives. In particular, the quantized phase shift (QPS) is assumed to be
available at the IRS, which, however, does not always hold and should be fed
back to the IRS in practice. Unfortunately, the feedback channel is generally
bandwidth-limited, which cannot support a huge amount of feedback overhead of
the QPS particularly for a large number of reflecting elements and/or the
quantization level of each reflecting element. In order to break this
bottleneck, in this letter, we propose a convolutional autoencoder-based
scheme, in which the QPS is compressed on the receiver side and reconstructed
on the IRS side. In order to solve the problems of mismatched distribution and
vanishing gradient, we remove the batch normalization (BN) layers and introduce
a denosing module. By doing so, it is possible to achieve a high compression
ratio with a reliable reconstruction accuracy in the bandwidth-limited feedback
channel, and it is also possible to accommodate existing works assuming

accuracy of the feedback/compressed QPS through a feedback channel, and show
that the proposed scheme can significantly outperform the existing compression

B {\bf 100}, 235201 (2019)]. The excitations comprise of a flat band and two
dispersive bands. The energies of the dispersive bands are
$E_{\pm}=\pm\sqrt{\alpha^2_n k^{2n}_\perp+v^2_z k^2_z}$ with
$k_\perp=\sqrt{k^2_x+k^2_y}$ and $n=1,2,3$. In this work, we obtain the exact
expression of Berry curvature, approximate form of density of states and Fermi
energy as a function of carrier density for any value of $n$. In particular, we
study the Berry curvature induced electrical and thermal magnetotransport
properties of quadratic $(n=2)$ triple-component fermions using semiclassical
Boltzmann transport formalism. Since the energy spectrum is anisotropic, we
consider two orientations of magnetic field (${\bf B}$): (i) ${\bf B}$ applied
in the $x$-$y$ plane and (ii) ${\bf B}$ applied in the $x$-$z$ plane. For both
the orientations, the longitudinal and planar magnetoelectric/magnetothermal
conductivities show the usual quadratic-$B$ dependence and oscillatory
behaviour with respect to the angle between the applied electric
field/temperature gradient and magnetic field as observed in other topological
semimetals. However, the out-of-plane magnetoconductivity has an oscillatory
dependence on angle between the applied fields for the second orientation but
is angle-independent for the first one. We observe large differences in the
magnitudes of transport coefficients for the two orientations at a given Fermi
energy. A noteworthy feature of quadratic triple-component fermions which is
typically absent in conventional systems is that certain transport coefficients
and their ratios are independent of Fermi energy within the low-energy model.

cases where user-provided labels are scarce. These models are able to learn to
predict novel classes simply by training on a non-overlapping set of classes.
This can be largely attributed to the differences in their mechanisms as
compared to conventional deep networks. However, this also offers new
opportunities for novel attackers to induce integrity attacks against such
models, which are not present in other machine learning setups. In this work,
we aim to close this gap by studying a conceptually simple approach to defend
few-shot classifiers against adversarial attacks. More specifically, we propose
a simple attack-agnostic detection method, using the concept of self-similarity
and filtering, to flag out adversarial support sets which destroy the
understanding of a victim classifier for a certain class. Our extended
evaluation on the miniImagenet (MI) and CUB datasets exhibit good attack
detection performance, across three different few-shot classifiers and across
different attack strengths, beating baselines. Our observed results allow our
approach to establishing itself as a strong detection method for support set
poisoning attacks. We also show that our approach constitutes a generalizable
concept, as it can be paired with other filtering functions. Finally, we
provide an analysis of our results when we vary two components found in our

fail to focus on learning effective representations, and heavily rely on the
ImageNet pre-training, which might be unreasonable for the few-shot recognition
setting due to semantics overlap. In this paper, we aim to present an in-depth
study on few-shot video classification by making three contributions. First, we
perform a consistent comparative study on the existing metric-based methods to
figure out their limitations in representation learning. Accordingly, we
propose a simple classifier-based baseline without any temporal alignment that
surprisingly outperforms the state-of-the-art meta-learning based methods.
Second, we discover that there is a high correlation between the novel action

leads to a quite dynamic and complex interaction, posing great difficulty to
learn an intelligent policy. This paper develops the dynamic permutation state
representation in the framework of integrated decision and control (IDC) to
handle signalized intersections with mixed traffic flows. Specially, this
representation introduces an encoding function and summation operator to
construct driving states from environmental observation, capable of dealing
with different types and variant number of traffic participants. A constrained
optimal control problem is built wherein the objective involves tracking
performance and the constraints for different participants and signal lights
are designed respectively to assure safety. We solve this problem by offline
optimizing encoding function, value function and policy function, wherein the
reasonable state representation will be given by the encoding function and then
served as the input of policy and value function. An off-policy training is
designed to reuse observations from driving environment and backpropagation
through time is utilized to update the policy function and encoding function
jointly. Verification result shows that the dynamic permutation state
representation can enhance the driving performance of IDC, including comfort,
decision compliance and safety with a large margin. The trained driving policy
can realize efficient and smooth passing in the complex intersection,
guaranteeing driving intelligence and safety simultaneously.

pipelines can achieve the desired sensitivity of ECHO, i.e. $\sigma (r =0) \sim

bias on recovered $r$ for complex spectral models (power-law and curved

levitation system. First, a proportional-integral sliding mode controller
(PI-SMC) is designed using a new switching surface and a proportional plus
power rate reaching law. The PI-SMC is more robust than a feedback
linearization controller in the presence of mismatched uncertainties and
outperforms the SMC schemes reported recently in the literature in terms of the
convergence rate and settling time. Next, to reduce the chattering phenomenon
in the PI-SMC, a state feedback-based discrete-time SMC algorithm is developed.
However, the disturbance rejection ability is compromised to some extent.
Furthermore, to improve the robustness without compromising the chattering
reduction benefits of the discrete-time SMC, mismatched uncertainties like
sensor noise and track input disturbance are incorporated in a robust
discrete-time SMC design using multirate output feedback (MROF). With this
technique, it is possible to realize the effect of a full-state feedback
controller without incurring the complexity of a dynamic controller or an
additional discrete-time observer. Also, the MROF-based discrete-time SMC
strategy can stabilize the magnetic levitation system with excellent dynamic
and steady-state performance with superior robustness in the presence of
mismatched uncertainties. The stability of the closed-loop system under the
proposed controllers is proved by using the Lyapunov stability theory. The
simulation results and analytical comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed control schemes.

on optical flow regularization or fine-tuning with test data to attain temporal

Besides, it is expensive to compute. Fine-tuning the original model in test
time is cost sensitive.
  This paper presents an efficient, intuitive, and unsupervised online
adaptation method, AuxAdapt, for improving the temporal consistency of most
neural network models. It does not require optical flow and only takes one pass
of the video. Since inconsistency mainly arises from the model's uncertainty in
its output, we propose an adaptation scheme where the model learns from its own
segmentation decisions as it streams a video, which allows producing more
confident and temporally consistent labeling for similarly-looking pixels
across frames. For stability and efficiency, we leverage a small auxiliary
segmentation network (AuxNet) to assist with this adaptation. More
specifically, AuxNet readjusts the decision of the original segmentation
network (Main-Net) by adding its own estimations to that of MainNet. At every
frame, only AuxNet is updated via back-propagation while keeping MainNet fixed.
We extensively evaluate our test-time adaptation approach on standard video
benchmarks, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and KITTI. The results demonstrate
that our approach provides label-wise accurate, temporally consistent, and
computationally efficient adaptation (5+ folds overhead reduction comparing to
state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods).

traffic information, including vehicular types (e.g., cars, trucks, and buses),
in the critical roads and highways. While traditional approaches based on
vehicular-embedded GPS sensors or camera networks would either invade drivers'
privacy or require high deployment cost, this paper introduces a low-cost
method, namely SenseMag, to recognize the vehicular type using a pair of
non-invasive magnetic sensors deployed on the straight road section. SenseMag
filters out noises and segments received magnetic signals by the exact time
points that the vehicle arrives or departs from every sensor node. Further,
SenseMag adopts a hierarchical recognition model to first estimate the
speed/velocity, then identify the length of vehicle using the predicted speed,
sampling cycles, and the distance between the sensor nodes. With the vehicle
length identified and the temporal/spectral features extracted from the
magnetic signals, SenseMag classify the types of vehicles accordingly. Some
semi-automated learning techniques have been adopted for the design of filters,
features, and the choice of hyper-parameters. Extensive experiment based on
real-word field deployment (on the highways in Shenzhen, China) shows that
SenseMag significantly outperforms the existing methods in both classification
accuracy and the granularity of vehicle types (i.e., 7 types by SenseMag versus
4 types by the existing work in comparisons). To be specific, our field
experiment results validate that SenseMag is with at least $90\%$ vehicle type
classification accuracy and less than 5\% vehicle length classification error.

semantic segmentation, which can capture both temporal consistency and
pixel-wise correctness. Given two nearby video frames, perceptual consistency
measures how much the segmentation decisions agree with the pixel
correspondences obtained via matching general perceptual features. More
specifically, for each pixel in one frame, we find the most perceptually
correlated pixel in the other frame. Our intuition is that such a pair of
pixels are highly likely to belong to the same class. Next, we assess how much
the segmentation agrees with such perceptual correspondences, based on which we
derive the perceptual consistency of the segmentation maps across these two
frames. Utilizing perceptual consistency, we can evaluate the temporal
consistency of video segmentation by measuring the perceptual consistency over
consecutive pairs of segmentation maps in a video. Furthermore, given a
sparsely labeled test video, perceptual consistency can be utilized to aid with
predicting the pixel-wise correctness of the segmentation on an unlabeled
frame. More specifically, by measuring the perceptual consistency between the
predicted segmentation and the available ground truth on a nearby frame and
combining it with the segmentation confidence, we can accurately assess the
classification correctness on each pixel. Our experiments show that the
proposed perceptual consistency can more accurately evaluate the temporal
consistency of video segmentation as compared to flow-based measures.
Furthermore, it can help more confidently predict segmentation accuracy on
unlabeled test frames, as compared to using classification confidence alone.
Finally, our proposed measure can be used as a regularizer during the training
of segmentation models, which leads to more temporally consistent video
segmentation while maintaining accuracy.

social media data. The high-dimensional nature of these signals implies that
they often need to be compressed in order to be stored and transmitted. The
common framework for graph signal compression is based on sampling, resulting
in a set of continuous-amplitude samples, which in turn have to be quantized
into a finite bit representation. In this work we study the joint design of
graph signal sampling along with quantization, for graph signal compression. We
focus on bandlimited graph signals, and show that the compression problem can
be represented as a task-based quantization setup, in which the task is to
recover the spectrum of the signal. Based on this equivalence, we propose a
joint design of the sampling and recovery mechanisms for a fixed quantization
mapping, and present an iterative algorithm for dividing the available bit
budget among the discretized samples. Furthermore, we show how the proposed
approach can be realized using graph filters combining elements corresponding
the neighbouring nodes of the graph, thus facilitating distributed
implementation at reduced complexity. Our numerical evaluations on both
synthetic and real world data shows that the joint sampling and quantization
method yields a compact finite bit representation of high-dimensional graph
signals, which allows reconstruction of the original signal with accuracy
within a small gap of that achievable with infinite resolution quantizers.

attempts to take into account the effects of parameter-dependent systematic

spatio-temporal summary of each sign video effectively in a single RGB image.
We propose two different approaches using this RGB-MHI model. In the first
approach, we use the RGB-MHI model as a motion-based spatial attention module
integrated into a 3D-CNN architecture. In the second approach, we use RGB-MHI
model features directly with the features of a 3D-CNN model using a late fusion

large-scale isolated sign language datasets, namely AUTSL and BosphorusSign22k.
Our experiments show that our models, which use only RGB data, can compete with
the state-of-the-art models in the literature that use multi-modal data.

the sphere. Then, an iterative algorithm is designed to tune these inputs for
the desired configurations. The feasibility of the proposed approach is

it will require similar studies at lower and higher energies as well as the

breakup decay rate of $^9$Be+p at 2.72A MeV, where the $\alpha$+$\alpha$+n
configuration is mainly accessible. Compare and interpret data at 2.72A MeV and
5.67A MeV into a 4-body CDCC formalism; Point out and discuss couplings to

measurement in a full kinematic approach of $^9$Be incident on a proton target
at 2.72A MeV, together with elastic scattering and other reaction channels
measurements under the same experimental conditions. The interpretation of the
data at 2.72A MeV and 5.67A MeV is considered in a 4-body CDCC approach, using
the Transformed Harmonic Oscillator method for the 3-body projectile. Results:
An elastic scattering angular distribution at 2.72A MeV is measured, which
compares very well with CDCC calculations, indicating a strong coupling to
continuum. At the same energy, the measured breakup and total reaction cross
sections present good agreement with the calculated values. Further on, the
elastic scattering and breakup cross section data at 5.67A MeV are found in
very good agreement with the CDCC calculations. The present results support
further our 3-body model for the structure of $^9$Be, validating relevant
radiative reaction rates obtained previously.

Those predictors are hard to interpret and sensitive to many hyperparameters to
be tuned, hence, the resulting accuracy of the generated models is often
harmed. In this work we resolve this by introducing Bilinear Interpretable
Neural Architecture Search (BINAS), that is based on an accurate and simple
bilinear formulation of both an accuracy estimator and the expected resource

guarantees. The simplicity of our proposed estimator together with the
intuitive way it is constructed bring interpretability through many insights
about the contribution of different design choices. For example, we find that
in the examined search space, adding depth and width is more effective at
deeper stages of the network and at the beginning of each resolution stage. Our
experiments show that BINAS generates comparable to or better architectures

state of the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice with hole doping. At
half-filling, it is known that the ground state of the Hubbard model on
triangular lattice develops a 120 degree coplanar order at half-filling in the
strong interaction limit, i.e., in the spin 1/2 anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg
model on the triangular lattice. The ground state property in the doped case is
still in controversy even though extensive studies were performed in the past.
Within Hartree Fock theory, we find that the 120 degree order persists from
zero doping to about 0.3 hole doping. At 1/3 hole doping, a three-sublattice
collinear order emerges in which the doped hole is concentrated on one of the
three sublattices with antiferromagnetic Neel order on the remaining two
sublattices, which forms a honeycomb lattice. Between the 120 degree order and
1/3 doping region, a phase separation occurs in which the 120 degree order
coexists with the collinear anti-ferromagnetic order in different region of the
system. The collinear phase extends from 1/3 doping to about 0.41 doping,
beyond which the ground state is paramagnetic with uniform electron density.
The phase diagram from Hartree Fock could provide guidance for the future study
of the doped Hubbard model on triangular lattice with more sophisticated
many-body approaches.

tackle the problem by pixel-wise feature fusion but need to randomly selecte
numerous points from images, which can not satisfy the demands of fast
inference simultaneously and accurate pose estimation. In this work, we present
a novel deep neural network based on dynamic keypoints selection designed for
6DoF pose estimation from a single RGBD image. Our network includes three
parts, instance semantic segmentation, edge points detection and 6DoF pose
estimation. Given an RGBD image, our network is trained to predict pixel
category and the translation to edge points and center points. Then, a
least-square fitting manner is applied to estimate the 6DoF pose parameters.
Specifically, we propose a dynamic keypoints selection algorithm to choose
keypoints from the foreground feature map. It allows us to leverage geometric
and appearance information. During 6DoF pose estimation, we utilize the
instance semantic segmentation result to filter out background points and only
use foreground points to finish edge points detection and 6DoF pose estimation.

an alignment that either maximizes the number of aligned symbols (the longest
common subsequence (LCS)), or minimizes the number of unaligned symbols (the
alignment distance (AD)). Multiple sequence alignment is a well-studied problem
in bioinformatics and is used to identify regions of similarity among DNA, RNA,
or protein sequences to detect functional, structural, or evolutionary
relationships among them. It is known that exact computation of LCS or AD of
$m$ sequences each of length $n$ requires $\Theta(n^m)$ time unless the Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis is false. In this paper, we provide several results
to approximate LCS and AD of multiple sequences.
  If the LCS of $m$ sequences each of length $n$ is $\lambda n$ for some
$\lambda \in [0,1]$, then in $\tilde{O}_m(n^{\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor+1})$
time, we can return a common subsequence of length at least $\frac{\lambda^2
n}{2+\epsilon}$ for any arbitrary constant $\epsilon >0$.
  It is possible to approximate the AD within a factor of two in time
$\tilde{O}_m(n^{\lceil\frac{m}{2}\rceil})$. However, going below-2
approximation requires breaking the triangle inequality barrier which is a
major challenge in this area. No such algorithm with a running time of
$O(n^{\alpha m})$ for any $\alpha < 1$ is known. If the AD is $\theta n$, then
we design an algorithm that approximates the AD within an approximation factor
of $\left(2-\frac{3\theta}{16}+\epsilon\right)$ in
$\tilde{O}_m(n^{\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor+2})$ time. Thus, if $\theta$ is a
constant, we get a below-two approximation in
$\tilde{O}_m(n^{\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor+2})$ time. Moreover, we show if just
one out of $m$ sequences is $(p,B)$-pseudorandom then, we get a below-2
approximation in $\tilde{O}_m(nB^{m-1}+n^{\lfloor \frac{m}{2}\rfloor+3})$ time
irrespective of $\theta$.

a linear minimum variance unbiased estimation (MVUE) in linear models. In this
paper, we take a first step towards extending this result to non-linear
settings via deep learning with bias constraints. The classical approach to
designing non-linear MVUEs is through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which
often involves real-time computationally challenging optimizations. On the
other hand, deep learning methods allow for non-linear estimators with fixed
computational complexity. Learning based estimators perform optimally on
average with respect to their training set but may suffer from significant bias
in other parameters. To avoid this, we propose to add a simple bias constraint
to the loss function, resulting in an estimator we refer to as Bias Constrained
Estimator (BCE). We prove that this yields asymptotic MVUEs that behave
similarly to the classical MLEs and asymptotically attain the Cramer Rao bound.
We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in the context of signal to noise
ratio estimation as well as covariance estimation. A second motivation to BCE
is in applications where multiple estimates of the same unknown are averaged
for improved performance. Examples include distributed sensor networks and data
augmentation in test-time. In such applications, we show that BCE leads to
asymptotically consistent estimators.

presence of fine structures, in particular the so-called magnetic bright points
(MBPs), which are small-scale features associated with strong magnetic field
regions of the order of kilogauss (kG). It is especially relevant to study
these magnetic elements, which are extensively detected at all moments of the
solar cycle, in order to establish their contribution to the behaviour of the
solar atmosphere, and ultimately a plausible role within the coronal heating
problem. Aims. We aim to characterise the size and velocity distributions of
MBPs in the solar photosphere in two different datasets of quiet Sun images
acquired with the Solar Optical Telescope SOT/Hinode and the High-resolution
Fast Imager HiFI/GREGOR, in the G-band (4308 angstroms). Methods. In order to
detect the MBPs, an automatic segmentation and identification algorithm was
used. Next, the identified features were tracked to measure their proper
motions. Finally, a statistical analysis of hundreds of MBPs was carried out,
generating histograms for areas, diameters, and horizontal velocities. Results.
This work establishes that areas and diameters of MBPs display log-normal
distributions that are well fitted by two different components, whereas the
velocity vector components follow Gaussians, and the vector magnitude follows a
Rayleigh distribution again revealing a two-component composition for all
vector elements. Conclusions. The results can be interpreted as due to the
presence of two different populations of MBPs in the solar photosphere, one
likely related to stronger network magnetic flux elements and the other one to
weaker intranetwork flux elemens. In particular, this work concludes on the
effect of the different spatial resolutions of the GREGOR and Hinode
telescopes, affecting detections and average values.

spectral analysis has evidenced a sequence of similar blackbody plus cutoff
power-law spectra, on ever decreasing time intervals during the entire UPE

composed of a Kerr black hole and a uniform test magnetic field B0, aligned
with the BH rotation axis, operates in an overcritical field. We infer an
$e^+e^-$ pair electromagnetic plasma in presence of a baryon load, a PEMB
pulse, originating from a vacuum polarization quantum process in the inner
engine. This initially optically thick plasma self-accelerates, giving rise at
the transparency radius to the MeV radiation observed by Ferm-GBM. At trf >
3.99 s, the electric field becomes undercritical, and the inner engine operates
in the classical electrodynamics regime and generate the GeV emission. During
both the quantum and the classical electrodynamics processes, we determine the
time varying mass and spin of the Kerr BH in the inner engine, fulfilling the
Christodoulou-Hawking-Ruffini mass-energy formula. For the first time, we
quantitatively show how the inner engine, by extracting the rotational energy
of the Kerr BH, produces a series of PEMB pulses. We follow the quantum vacuum
polarization process in sequences with decreasing time bins. We compute the
Lorentz factors, the baryon loads and the radii at transparency, as well as the
value of the magnetic field, assumed to be constant in each sequence. The

found, we explore $\Lambda(t)$ given by the phenomenological law
$\Lambda(t)=\lambda+\sigma H$, where $\lambda$ and $\sigma$ are positive

$\Lambda_{H1}$ and $\Lambda_{H2}$ by assuming $\Lambda=\lambda$ and
$\Lambda=\sigma H$, respectively. Notice that $\Lambda_{H1}$ is the analog of
the standard $\Lambda$CDM, but within the Brans-Dicke cosmology. We find the
analytical solution of the main cosmological functions such as the Hubble

these models. In order to test the viability of the cosmological scenarios, we
perform two sets of joint observational analyses of the recent Type Ia
supernova data (Pantheon), observational measurements of Hubble parameter data,
Baryon acoustic oscillation/Cosmic microwave background data and Local Hubble
constant for each model. For the sake of comparison, the same data analysis is
performed for the $\Lambda$CDM model. Each model shows a transition from
decelerated phase to accelerated phase and can be viewed as an effective
quintessence behavior. Using the model selection criteria AIC and BIC to

interaction channel for most businesses. However, not all interactions are
smooth, and customer intent misunderstanding is a major cause of dialogue
failure. We show that intent prediction can be improved by training a deep
text-to-text neural model to generate successive user utterances from unlabeled
dialogue data. For that, we define a multi-task training regime that utilizes
successive user-utterance generation to improve the intent prediction. Our
approach achieves the reported improvement due to two complementary factors:
First, it uses a large amount of unlabeled dialogue data for an auxiliary
generation task. Second, it uses the generated user utterance as an additional
signal for the intent prediction model. Lastly, we present a novel look-ahead
approach that uses user utterance generation to improve intent prediction in
inference time. Specifically, we generate counterfactual successive user
utterances for conversations with ambiguous predicted intents, and disambiguate
the prediction by reassessing the concatenated sequence of available and
generated utterances.

applications involving heat, fluids, materials, and proteins, to name a few. As
an example, in implicit variational solvation, for the construction of
biomolecular shapes, the electrostatic contributions satisfy the
Poisson-Boltzmann equation with discontinuous dielectric constants across the
interface. When interface motions are involved, one often needs not only
accurate solution values, but accurate derivatives as well, such as the normal
derivatives at the interface. We introduce here the Compact Coupling Interface
Method (CCIM), a finite difference method for the elliptic interface problem
with interfacial jump conditions. The CCIM can calculate solution values and
their derivatives up to second-order accuracy in arbitrary ambient space
dimensions. It combines elements of Chern and Shu's Coupling Interface Method
and Mayo's approach for elliptic interface boundary value problems, leading to
more compact finite difference stencils that are applicable to more general

on complex protein molecules in three dimensions support the efficacy of our

resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices by the placement of their
tasks on the edge and/or cloud servers. Recently, several Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL)-based placement techniques have been proposed in fog/edge
computing environments, which are only suitable for centralized setups. The
training of well-performed DRL agents requires manifold training data while
obtaining training data is costly. Hence, these centralized DRL-based
techniques lack generalizability and quick adaptability, thus failing to
efficiently tackle application placement problems. Moreover, many IoT
applications are modeled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with diverse
topologies. Satisfying dependencies of DAG-based IoT applications incur
additional constraints and increase the complexity of placement problems. To
overcome these challenges, we propose an actor-critic-based distributed
application placement technique, working based on the IMPortance weighted
Actor-Learner Architectures (IMPALA). IMPALA is known for efficient distributed
experience trajectory generation that significantly reduces the exploration
costs of agents. Besides, it uses an adaptive off-policy correction method for
faster convergence to optimal solutions. Our technique uses recurrent layers to
capture temporal behaviors of input data and a replay buffer to improve the
sample efficiency. The performance results, obtained from simulation and
testbed experiments, demonstrate that our technique significantly improves the
execution cost of IoT applications up to 30\% compared to its counterparts.

is the normal Maxwell distribution. It is well known that for sub-recoiled

describe the cool gas. Specifically, we derive the scaling function and the
infinite invariant density of a stochastic model for the momentum of laser
cooled atoms using two approaches. The first is a direct analysis of the master
equation and the second following the analysis of Bertin and Bardou using the
lifetime dynamics. The two methods are shown to be identical, but yield
different insights into the problem. In the main part of the paper we focus on
the case where the laser trapping is strong, namely the rate of escape from the
velocity trap is $R(v) \propto |v|^\alpha$ for $v \to 0$ and $\alpha>1$. We
construct a machinery to investigate the time averages of physical observables
and their relation to ensemble averages. The time averages are given in terms
of functionals of the individual stochastic paths, and here we use a
generalisation of L\'evy walks to investigate the ergodic properties of the
system. Exploring the energy of the system, we show that when $\alpha=3$ it
exhibits a transition between phases where it is either an integrable or non
integrable observable, with respect to the infinite invariant measure. This
transition corresponds to very different properties of the mean energy, and to
a discontinuous behaviour of the fluctuations. Since previous experimental work
showed that both $\alpha=2$ and $\alpha=4$ are attainable we believe that both
phases could be explored also experimentally.

accompanied by a para- to ferroelastic transition. With the help of Raman
spectroscopy and density-functional theory (DFT)-based calculations, here we
report new intriguing observations associated with the phase transition in
Ba2ZnTeO6 elucidating the lattice dynamics across the Tc. We have observed the
presence of a central peak (quasi-elastic Rayleigh profile), huge softening in
the soft mode, hysteretic phonon behavior, and signatures of coexistent phases.
The existence of a central peak in Ba2ZnTeO6 is manifested by a sharp rise in
the intensity of the Rayleigh profile in concomitant with the damping of the
soft mode near Tc, shedding light on the lattice dynamics during the phase
transition. While most of the phonon bands split below Tc confirming the phase
transition, we have observed thermal hysteretic behavior of phonon modes that
signifies the first-order nature of the transition and presence of coexisting
phases, which are corroborated by our temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction
and specific heat measurements. Further, an evidence of the concomitant
structural transition appears in the form of huge softening in the thermal
response of the soft phonon mode at ~ 31 cm-1 which is remarkable compared to
the hitherto known behavior of soft modes in well-known ferroelectrics. This is
further corroborated by our phonon calculations that show an unstable Eg-mode
in the high-symmetry structure involving TeO6 octahedral rotation (with Ba and
Zn translation) which later condenses into the C2/m low-symmetry phase.

curvature level. Since a convenient formula is known for tangential velocity
that maintains the equidistribution rule with curvature-type monitor functions,
the strategy enables to compute the correspondence between the arclength and
another spatial variable by evolving the interpolated curve. With a certain
normalization, velocity information in the motion is obtained with spectral
accuracy while the resulting parametrization remains unchanged. Then, the
algorithm extracts a refined representation of the input curve by sampling its
arclength parametrization whose Fourier coefficients are directly accessed
through a simple change of variables. As a validation, improvements to spatial
resolution are evaluated by approximating the invariant coefficients from
downsampled data and observing faster global convergence to the original shape.

efficiency, and the flexibility of automation, but often requires
application-specific methods to detect human state and determine robot
response. At the same time, many potential human-robot interaction tasks
involve discrete modes, such as phases of a task or multiple possible goals,
where each mode has a distinct objective and human behavior. In this paper, we
propose a novel method for multi-modal physical human-robot interaction that
builds a Gaussian process model for human force in each mode of a collaborative
task. These models are then used for Bayesian inference of the mode, and to
determine robot reactions through model predictive control. This approach
enables optimization of robot trajectory based on the belief of human intent,
while considering robot impedance and human joint configuration, according to
ergonomic- and/or task-related objectives. The proposed method reduces
programming time and complexity, requiring only a low number of demonstrations
(here, three per mode) and a mode-specific objective function to commission a
flexible online human-robot collaboration task. We validate the method with
experiments on an admittance-controlled industrial robot, performing a
collaborative assembly task with two modes where assistance is provided in full
six degrees of freedom. It is shown that the developed algorithm robustly
re-plans to changes in intent or robot initial position, achieving online
control at 15 Hz.

and slow-mode-like compressive fluctuations are energetically decoupled at
small scales in the inertial range. The partition of energy between these
fluctuations determines the nature of dissipation, which, in many astrophysical
systems, happens on scales where plasma is collisionless. However, when the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) drives the turbulence, it is difficult to
resolve numerically the scale at which both types of fluctuations start to be
decoupled because the MRI energy injection occurs in a broad range of
wavenumbers, and both types of fluctuations are usually expected to be coupled
even at relatively small scales. In this study, we focus on collisional MRI
turbulence threaded by a near-azimuthal mean magnetic field, which is naturally
produced by the differential rotation of a disc. We show that, in such a case,
the decoupling scales are reachable using a reduced MHD model that includes
differential-rotation effects. In our reduced MHD model, the Alfv\'enic and
compressive fluctuations are coupled only through the linear terms that are
proportional to the angular velocity of the accretion disc. We numerically
solve for the turbulence in this model and show that the Alfv\'enic and
compressive fluctuations are decoupled at the small scales of our simulations
as the nonlinear energy transfer dominates the linear coupling below the
MRI-injection scale. In the decoupling scales, the energy flux of compressive
fluctuations contained in the small scales is almost double that of Alfv\'enic
fluctuations. Finally, we discuss the application of this result to
prescriptions of ion-to-electron heating ratio in hot accretion flows.

task state or errors, enabling improved robustness and autonomy. The ability to
detect contact is affected by the mechatronic design of the robot, especially
its physical compliance. Established methods can design physical compliance for
many aspects of contact performance (e.g. peak contact force, motion/force
control bandwidth), but are based on time-invariant dynamic models. A change in
contact mode is a discrete change in coupled robot-environment dynamics, not
easily considered in existing design methods. Towards designing robots which
can robustly detect changes in contact mode online, this paper investigates how
mechatronic design can improve contact estimation, with a focus on the impact
of the location and degree of compliance. A design metric of information gain
is proposed which measures how much position/force measurements reduce
uncertainty in the contact mode estimate. This information gain is developed
for fully- and partially-observed systems, as partial observability can arise
from joint flexibility in the robot or environmental inertia. Hardware
experiments with various compliant setups validate that information gain
predicts the speed and certainty with which contact is detected in (i)
monitoring of contact-rich assembly and (ii) collision detection.

of considerable interest. Sharpness conditions directly control the recovery
performance of restart schemes for first-order methods without the need for
restrictive assumptions such as strong convexity. However, they are challenging
to apply in the presence of noise or approximate model classes (e.g.,
approximate sparsity). We provide a first-order method: Weighted, Accelerated
and Restarted Primal-dual (WARPd), based on primal-dual iterations and a novel
restart-reweight scheme. Under a generic approximate sharpness condition, WARPd
achieves stable linear convergence to the desired vector. Many problems of
interest fit into this framework. For example, we analyze sparse recovery in
compressed sensing, low-rank matrix recovery, matrix completion, TV
regularization, minimization of $\|Bx\|_{l^1}$ under constraints
($l^1$-analysis problems for general $B$), and mixed regularization problems.
We show how several quantities controlling recovery performance also provide
explicit approximate sharpness constants. Numerical experiments show that WARPd
compares favorably with specialized state-of-the-art methods and is ideally
suited for solving large-scale problems. We also present a noise-blind variant
based on the Square-Root LASSO decoder. Finally, we show how to unroll WARPd as

simulations on massively parallel computer architectures such as Graphic
Processing Units. However, one known drawback of this method is that the
discretization of differential terms involving spatial derivatives introduces a
spurious lattice anisotropy that can influence the solid-liquid interface
dynamics. We find that this influence is significant for the case of
polycrystalline dendritic solidification, where the crystal axes of different
grains do not generally coincide with the reference axes of the
finite-difference lattice. In particular, we find that with the commonly used
finite-difference implementation of the quantitative phase-field model of
binary alloy solidification, both the operating state of the dendrite tip and
the dendrite growth orientation are strongly affected by the lattice
anisotropy. To circumvent this problem, we use known methods in both real and
Fourier space to derive finite-difference approximations of leading
differential terms in 2D and 3D that are isotropic at order $h^2$ of the
lattice spacing $h$. Importantly, those terms include the divergence of the
anti-trapping current that is found to have a critical influence on pattern
selection. The 2D and 3D discretizations use an approximated form of the
anti-trapping current that facilitates the Fourier-space derivation of the
associated isotropic differential operator at $O(h^2)$, but we also derive a 2D
discretization of the standard form of this current. Finally, we present 2D and
3D phase-field simulations of alloy solidification, showing that the isotropic
finite-difference implementations can dramatically reduce spurious lattice

changes, such as produced by changes in behavior or social restrictions. In
this work we formulate a model that fits a ``SIR''-type model concurrently with
a statistical change detection test on the data. The result is a piece wise
autonomous ordinary differential equation, whose parameters change at various
points in time (automatically learned from the data). The main contributions of
our model are: (a) providing interpretation of the parameters, (b) determining
which parameters of the model are more important to produce changes in the
spread of the disease, and (c) using data-driven discovery of sudden changes in
the evolution of the pandemic. Together, these characteristics provide a new
model that better describes the situation and thus, provides better quality of
information for decision making.

The fact that the branching ratios of these decays are negligible in the

comparison to their charged dileptons counterparts, they are considered to
provide genuine null-tests of SM. Therefore the observation of these modes at
the level of current as well as planned experimental sensitivities would imply
unambiguous signature of new physics. Using the constraints on $Z'$ couplings
coming from a combined fit to $b \to s \ell \ell$, $\Delta M_s$ and neutrino

ruled out in the considered framework. The same is true for $D - \bar{D}$

the suppression of the emission (Razin-Tsytovich effect for the superluminal

the directly coherent pumping. Intuitively, dissipation is an unfavorable
factor for gain in a laser. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism of phonon
lasing from the dissipative coupling in a multimode optomechanical system. By
precisely engineering the dissipations of two membranes and tuning the
intensity modulation of the cavity light, the two-membrane-in-the-middle system
shows anti-parity-time (anti-PT) symmetry and the cavity mediated interaction
between two nanomechanical resonators becomes purely dissipative. The level
attraction and damping repulsion are clearly exhibited as the signature of
dissipative coupling. After the exceptional point, a non-Hermitian phase
transition, where eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenmodes coalesce, two
phonon modes are simultaneously excited into the self-sustained oscillation
regime by increasing the interaction strength over a critical value
(threshold). In distinct contrast to conventional phonon lasers, the
measurement of the second-order phonon correlation reveals the oscillatory and
biexponential phases in the nonlasing regime as well as the coherence phase in
the lasing regime. Our study provides a new method to study phonon lasers in a
non-Hermitian open system and could be applied to a wide range of disciplines,

theories of gravity such as superstring theory. Our approach about the
inflationary era is that it can be described in the context of Einstein's
gravity involving quantum corrections such as the Chern-Simons string inspired
parity violating gravitational term. The equations of motion namely, the
Friedmann equation, the Raychadhuri equation and the Klein-Gordon equation for
an expanding background are extracted from the gravitational action utilizing
the variational principle. The consequential system of differential equations
with respect to Hubble's parameter and the inflaton field was quite perplexed
in order to be solved with an analytic way. Therefore, the slow-roll conditions
during inflationary era were imposed and terms with minor numerically

proved that, models with exotic kinetic terms can generate viable results in
consistency with the latest Planck data. Finally, the presence of Chern-Simons
quantum corrections shifts the primordial spectral tensor index to blue. Even

non-smooth and has unbounded gradient noise. In particular, we prove that a
special algorithm called the mini-batch normalized gradient descent with

even in-distribution actions can raise serious problems. Since the dataset only

vulnerable to spurious correlations, i.e., the agent tends to prefer actions

To address such a challenge, we propose a practical and theoretically

uncertainty penalty into policy evaluation. We show that this is consistent
with the pessimism principle studied in theory, and the proposed algorithm
converges to the optimal policy with a sublinear rate under mild assumptions.

strongly minimal linearizations. The fact that they are valid for {\em any}
rational matrix is an improvement on any other previous approach for
constructing other classes of structure preserving linearizations, which are
not valid for any structured rational or polynomial matrix. The use of the
recent concept of strongly minimal linearization is the key for getting such
generality.

confinement potential, formed by a spatial transverse (radial) parabolic graded
refractive index and dissipation profile, combined with quadratic temporal
phase modulation, may permit the generation of stable spatiotemporal
dissipative solitons. This corresponds to combining phase mode-locking with the
distributed Kerr-lens mode-locking. Our study of the soliton characteristics
and stability is based on analytical and numerical solutions of the generalized
dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation. This approach could lead to higher

that the Big Bounce emerges in the dynamics for all the three sets of

total critical energy density has a maximum value fixed by fundamental
constants and the Immirzi parameter only. From a pure quantum point of view, we

from business-as-usual to complete shutdowns. Policies aimed at disrupting the
viral transmission cycle and preventing the healthcare system from being
overwhelmed, simultaneously exact an economic toll. We developed a intervention
policy model that comprised the relative human, economic and healthcare costs
of non-pharmaceutical epidemic intervention and arrived at the optimal strategy
using the neuroevolution algorithm. The proposed model finds the minimum
required reduction in contact rates to maintain the burden on the healthcare
system below the maximum capacity. We find that such a policy renders a sharp
increase in the control strength at the early stages of the epidemic, followed
by a steady increase in the subsequent ten weeks as the epidemic approaches its
peak, and finally control strength is gradually decreased as the population
moves towards herd immunity. We have also shown how such a model can provide an
efficient adaptive intervention policy at different stages of the epidemic
without having access to the entire history of its progression in the
population. This work emphasizes the importance of imposing intervention
measures early and provides insights into adaptive intervention policies to
minimize the economic impacts of the epidemic without putting an extra burden
on the healthcare system.

duplexing regime. The traffic pattern for each PU is assumed to be unknown to
the SU and is modeled as a finite-memory Markov chain. Since observations are
partial, then both channel sensing and access actions affect the throughput.
The objective is to maximize the SU's long-term throughput. To achieve this
goal, we develop a novel algorithm that learns both access and sensing policies
via deep Q-learning, dubbed Double Deep Q-network for Sensing and Access
(DDQSA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that solves both
sensing and access policies for DSA via deep Q-learning. Second, we analyze the
optimal policy theoretically to validate the performance of DDQSA. Although the
general DSA problem is P-SPACE hard, we derive the optimal policy explicitly
for a common model of a cyclic user dynamics. Our results show that DDQSA
learns a policy that implements both sensing and channel access, and
