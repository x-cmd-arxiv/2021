rapid star formation in each (or both) galactic centers and initial mixing of
stars in galactic disks due to violent relaxation. MBHs grow substantially due
to accretion and finally merge into a bigger black hole. The growth of galactic
bulges and corresponding increases of its velocity dispersions predate the
growth of MBHs in the dAGN stages. The MBHs in these stages deviate below the
relation between MBH mass and bulge mass (or velocity dispersion), and they
revert to the relation after the final mergers due to the significant accretion
that occurs mostly at a separation less than a few kpc. Then, the two MBHs

parallel and rotated with respect to the orientation of the filaments. This
pattern is in stark contrast to the predominantly parallel magnetic field
orientations observed in other GC NTFs. To help elucidate the origin of this
pattern, we analyze spectro-polarimetric data of the Radio Arc NTFs using an
Australian Telescope Compact Array data set covering the continuous frequency
range from $\sim$4 to 11 GHz at a spectral resolution of 2 MHz. We fit
depolarization models to the spectral polarization data to characterize Faraday
effects along the line-of-sight. We assess whether structures local to the
Radio Arc NTFs may contribute to the unusual magnetic field orientation.
External Faraday effects are identified as the most likely origin of the
rotation observed for the Radio Arc NTFs; however, internal Faraday effects are
also found to be likely in regions of parallel magnetic field. The increased
likelihood of internal Faraday effects in parallel magnetic field regions may
be attributed to the effects of structures local to the GC. One such structure
could be the Radio Shell local to the Radio Arc NTFs. Future studies are needed
to determine whether this alternating magnetic field pattern is present in
other multi-stranded NTFs, or is a unique property resulting from the complex

technology for thin-film photovoltaics, however, its potential for
Semi-Transparent Photovoltaics (STPV) is yet to be explored. In this paper, we
present its carrier transport physics explaining the trend seen in recently
published experiments. STPV requires deposition of films of only a few hundred
nanometers to make them transparent and manifests several unique properties
compared to a conventional thin-film solar cell. Our analysis shows that the
short-circuit current, Jsc is dominated by carriers generated in the depletion
region, making it nearly independent of bulk and back-surface recombination.
The bulk recombination, which limits the open-circuit voltage Voc, appears to
be higher than usual attributable to numerous grain boundaries. When the
absorber layer is reduced below 500 nm, grain size reduces resulting in more
grain boundaries and higher resistance. This produces an inverse relationship
between series resistance and absorber thickness. We also present a
thickness-dependent model of shunt resistance showing its impact in these
ultra-thin devices. For various scenarios of bulk and interface recombinations,
shunt and series resistances, AVT and composition of CuIn$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$Se$_2$,

alternative memory technologies to meet performance goals. Since these
technologies present distinct advantages and tradeoffs compared to conventional
DDR* SDRAM, such as higher bandwidth with lower capacity or vice versa, they
are typically packaged alongside conventional SDRAM in a heterogeneous memory
architecture. To utilize the different types of memory efficiently, new data
management strategies are needed to match application usage to the best
available memory technology. However, current proposals for managing
heterogeneous memories are limited because they either: 1) do not consider
high-level application behavior when assigning data to different types of
memory, or 2) require separate program execution (with a representative input)
to collect information about how the application uses memory resources.
  This work presents a toolset for addressing the limitations of existing
approaches for managing complex memories. It extends the application runtime
layer with automated monitoring and management routines that assign application
data to the best tier of memory based on previous usage, without any need for
source code modification or a separate profiling run. It evaluates this
approach on a state-of-the-art server platform with both conventional DDR4
SDRAM and non-volatile Intel Optane DC memory, using both memory-intensive high
performance computing (HPC) applications as well as standard benchmarks.
Overall, the results show that this approach improves program performance
significantly compared to a standard unguided approach across a variety of
workloads and system configurations. Additionally, we show that this approach
achieves similar performance as a comparable offline profiling-based approach
after a short startup period, without requiring separate program execution or
offline analysis steps.

that this effect is more pronounced in non-conventional singlet fission
materials in which the energy gap between the bright singlet exciton and the
multiexcitonic state is large (> 0.1 eV). In this case, the dynamics is
dominated by the polaritonic modes and not by the bare-molecule-like dark
states, and additionally, the resonant enhancement due to strong coupling is
very robust even for energetically broad molecular states. The present results
provide a new strategy to expand the range of suitable materials for efficient
singlet fission by making use of strong light-matter coupling.

experiments have opened up the possibility to constrain neutrino physics beyond
the standard model of elementary particle physics. Furthermore, by considering
neutrino-electron scattering in the keV-energy region, it is possible to set
additional limits on new physics processes. Here, we present constraints that
are derived from CONUS germanium data on beyond the standard model (BSM)
processes like tensor and vector non-standard interactions (NSIs) in the
neutrino-quark sector, as well as light vector and scalar mediators. Thanks to
the realized low background levels in the CONUS experiment at ionization
energies below 1 keV, we are able to set the world's best limits on tensor NSIs
from CE$\nu$NS and constrain the scale of corresponding new physics to lie
above 360 GeV. For vector NSIs, the derived limits strongly depend on the
assumed ionization quenching factor within the detector material, since small
quenching factors largely suppress potential signals for both, the expected
standard model CE$\nu$NS process and the vector NSIs. Furthermore, competitive
limits on scalar and vector mediators are obtained from the CE$\nu$NS channel
at reactor-site which allow to probe coupling constants as low as
$5\cdot10^{-5}$ of low mediator masses, assuming the currently favored
quenching factor regime. The consideration of neutrino-electron scatterings
allows to set even stronger constraints for mediator masses below $\sim1$ MeV
and $\sim 10$ MeV for scalar and vector mediators, respectively.

slow due to stragglers. While asynchronous training handles stragglers
efficiently, it does not ensure privacy due to the incompatibility with the
secure aggregation protocols. A buffered asynchronous training protocol known
as FedBuff has been proposed recently which bridges the gap between synchronous
and asynchronous training to mitigate stragglers and to also ensure privacy
simultaneously. FedBuff allows the users to send their updates asynchronously
while ensuring privacy by storing the updates in a trusted execution
environment (TEE) enabled private buffer. TEEs, however, have limited memory
which limits the buffer size. Motivated by this limitation, we develop a
buffered asynchronous secure aggregation (BASecAgg) protocol that does not rely
on TEEs. The conventional secure aggregation protocols cannot be applied in the
buffered asynchronous setting since the buffer may have local models
corresponding to different rounds and hence the masks that the users use to
protect their models may not cancel out. BASecAgg addresses this challenge by
carefully designing the masks such that they cancel out even if they correspond
to different rounds. Our convergence analysis and experiments show that
BASecAgg almost has the same convergence guarantees as FedBuff without relying
on TEEs.

these networks are spatially local. To learn global representations,
self-attention-based vision trans-formers (ViTs) have been adopted. Unlike

MobileViT, a light-weight and general-purpose vision transformer for mobile

currently hindered by their limited long-term stability under functional
activation. While the role of lattice flexibility in the thermal response of
perovskites has become increasingly evident, the description of
thermally-induced distortions is still unclear. In this work, we provide a
unified picture of thermal activation in CsPbBr3 across length scales, showing
that lattice symmetry does not increase at high temperatures. We combine
temperature-dependent XRD, Br K-edge XANES, ab initio MD simulations, and
calculations of the XANES spectra by first-principles, accounting for both
thermal fluctuations and core hole final state effects. We find that the
octahedral tilting of the Pb-Br inorganic framework statistically adopts
multiple local configurations over time - in the short-range. In turn, the
stochastic nature of the local thermal fluctuations uplifts the longer-range
periodic octahedral tilting characterizing the low temperature structure, with
the statistical mean of the local configurations resulting in a cubic-like
time-averaged lattice. These observations can be rationalized in terms of
displacive thermal phase transitions through the soft mode model, in which the
phonon anharmonicity of the flexible inorganic framework causes the excess free
energy surface to change as a function of temperature. Our work demonstrates
that the effect of thermal dynamics on the XANES spectra can be effectively
described for largely anharmonic systems, provided ab initio MD simulations are
performed to determine the dynamically fluctuating structures, and core hole
final state effects are included in order to retrieve an accurate XANES line
shape. Moreover, it shows that the soft mode model, previously invoked to
describe displacive thermal phase transitions in oxide perovskites, carries a
more general validity.

coupled to thermal baths is a great theoretical challenge with promising
applications in several fields of quantum technologies. Among several
strategies to gain access to the steady state, one consists in obtaining
approximate expressions of the mean force Gibbs state, the reduced state of the
global system-bath thermal state, largely credited to be the steady state.
Here, we present analytical expressions of corrective terms to the ultrastrong
coupling limit of the mean force Gibbs state, which has been recently derived.
We find that the first order term precisely coincides with the first order
correction obtained from a dynamical approach -- master equation in the
strong-decoherence regime. This strengthens the identification of the reduced
steady state with the mean force Gibbs state. Additionally, we also compare our
expressions with another recent result obtained from a high temperature
expansion of the mean force Gibbs state. We observe numerically a good
agreement for ultra strong coupling as well as for high temperatures. This
confirms the validity of all these results. In particular, we show that, in
term of coherences, all three results allow one to sketch the transition from
ultrastrong coupling to weak coupling.

Nevertheless, the evolution of a CME magnetic structure can be followed using a

the analysis of two CMEs that erupted from the Sun on 28 April 2012. We follow
their eruption and early evolution using remote-sensing data, finding

counterpart(s) using in-situ measurements at Venus, Earth, and Saturn. We
observe a seemingly single flux rope at all locations, but find possible
signatures of interaction at Earth, where high-cadence plasma data are
available. Reconstructions of the in-situ flux ropes provide almost identical
results at Venus and Earth but show greater discrepancies at Saturn, suggesting
that the CME was highly distorted and/or that further interaction with nearby
solar wind structures took place before 10 AU. This work highlights the
difficulties in connecting structures from the Sun to the outer heliosphere and
demonstrates the importance of multi-spacecraft studies to achieve a deeper

a moving sensor with their own sensor while observing the moving sensor's data

McKean-Vlasov (mean-field) stochastic differential equations with jumps
(conditional McKean-Vlasov jump diffusions, for short). To this end, we first
prove a stochastic Fokker-Planck equation for the conditional law of the
solution of such equations. Combining this equation with the original state
equation, we obtain a Markovian system for the state and its conditional law.
Furthermore, we apply this to formulate an Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
equation for the optimal control of conditional McKean-Vlasov jump diffusions.
Then we study the situation when the law is absolutely continuous with respect
to Lebesgue measure. In that case the Fokker-Planck equation reduces to a
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) for the Radon-Nikodym
derivative of the conditional law. Finally we apply these results to solve
explicitly the following problems: -Linear-quadratic optimal control of
conditional stochastic McKean-Vlasov jump diffusions. -Optimal consumption from
a cash flow modelled as a conditional stochastic McKean-Vlasov differential
equation with jumps.

(iii) both $v^\star$ and $q^\star$ lie in the linear span when restricted to

showed that under (ii) the minimax query complexity of any planning algorithm
is at least exponential in the horizon $H$ or in the feature dimension $d$ when
the size $A$ of the action set can be chosen to be exponential in $\min(d,H)$.
On the other hand, for the setting (i), Weisz et al. (2021a) introduced
TensorPlan, a planner whose query cost is polynomial in all relevant quantities
when the number of actions is fixed. Among other things, these two works left
open the question whether polynomial query complexity is possible when $A$ is
subexponential in $\min(d,H)$. In this paper we answer this question in the
negative: we show that an exponentially large lower bound holds when
$A=\Omega(\min(d^{1/4},H^{1/2}))$, under either (i), (ii) or (iii). In
particular, this implies a perhaps surprising exponential separation of query
complexity compared to the work of Du et al. (2021) who prove a polynomial
upper bound when (iii) holds for all states. Furthermore, we show that the
upper bound of TensorPlan can be extended to hold under (iii) and, for MDPs
with deterministic transitions and stochastic rewards, also under (ii).

  Marginalization",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present $\Delta$-UQ -- a novel, general-purpose uncertainty estimator
using the concept of anchoring in predictive models. Anchoring works by first
transforming the input into a tuple consisting of an anchor point drawn from a
prior distribution, and a combination of the input sample with the anchor using
a pretext encoding scheme. This encoding is such that the original input can be
perfectly recovered from the tuple -- regardless of the choice of the anchor.
Therefore, any predictive model should be able to predict the target response
from the tuple alone (since it implicitly represents the input). Moreover, by
varying the anchors for a fixed sample, we can estimate uncertainty in the
prediction even using only a single predictive model. We find this uncertainty
is deeply connected to improper sampling of the input data, and inherent noise,
enabling us to estimate the total uncertainty in any system. With extensive

is studied in an extended Lebwohl-Lasher model. Molecules interact only with
their nearest neighbors through the pair potential that depends on the molecule
orientations. It is known that in the homogeneous system there is a direct
second-order transition from the isotropic to the biaxial nematic phase, but
properties of confined systems are less known. In the present paper the lattice
has periodic boundary conditions in the X and Y directions and it has two walls
with planar anchoring, perpendicular to the Z direction. We have investigated
the model using Monte Carlo simulations on $N_x \times N_y \times N_z$
lattices, $N_x = N_y = 10, 16$, $N_z$ from 3 to 19, with and without assuming
mirror symmetry. This study is complementary to the statistical description of
hard spheroplatelets near a hard wall by Kapanowski and Abram [Phys. Rev. E 89,
062503 (2014)]. The temperature dependence of the order-parameter profiles
between walls is calculated for many wall separations. For large wall
separations there are the surface layers with biaxial ordering at both walls
(4-5 lattice constants wide) and beyond the surface layers the order parameters
have values as in the homogeneous system. For small wall separations the
isotropic-biaxial transition is shifted and the surface layers are thinner.
Above the isotropic-biaxial transition the preferable orientations in both
surface layers can be different. It is interesting that planar anchoring for
biaxial molecules leads to the uniaxial interactions at the wall. As a result
we get the planar Lebwohl-Lasher model with additional (biaxial) interactions
with the neighbors from the second layer, where the Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition is present.

bringing along with it the possibility of higher credit defaults and hence
higher delinquency rates, over a period of time. The purpose of this research
paper is to build a contemporary credit scoring model to forecast credit
defaults for unsecured lending (credit cards), by employing machine learning
techniques. As much of the customer payments data available to lenders, for
forecasting Credit defaults, is imbalanced (skewed), on account of a limited
subset of default instances, this poses a challenge for predictive modelling.

region of non-dimensional parameter space typical of the mid- to low-latitude

pathways arise from both shear and gravitational instabilities, and we find
that the boundary layers are stabilized by increased outer boundary layer
stratification during the downslope oscillation phase. However, if rotation is
significant (low slope Burger numbers) we find that boundary layer turbulence

global scene context and local geometry, with the goal of generalizing beyond

By doing so, object instances are implicitly placed into novel out-of-context

is grazing, when it has plunged-in, or when it is well-within the envelope of
the red giant (in each stage for ~11 days). The dynamics of the jets through
the common envelope (CE) depend on the conditions of the environment as well as
on their powering. In the grazing stage and the commencement of the plunge
self-regulated jets need higher efficiencies to break out of the envelope of
the RG. Deep inside the CE, on the timescales simulated, jets are choked
independently of whether they are self-regulated or constantly powered. Jets
able to break out of the envelope of the RG in large-scale simulations, are
choked in our small-scale simulations. The accreted angular momentum onto the
secondary star is not large enough to form a disk. The mass accretion onto the
MS star is 1-10% of the Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton rate (~1e-3 - 1e-1 Msun yr/s).
High luminosity emission, from X-rays to UV and optical, is expected if the
jets break out of the CE. Our simulations illustrate the need for inclusion of
more realistic accretion and jet models in the dynamical evolution of the CEs.

baryonic feedback processes which are still poorly understood. So far, this
challenge has been faced either by imposing scale-cuts in the data or by
modelling baryonic effects with simple, one-parameter models. In this paper, we
rely on a more general, seven-parameter prescription of baryonic feedback
effects, which is primarily motivated by observations and has been shown to
agree with a plethora of hydrodynamical simulations. By combining weak-lensing
data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) with observations of gas around
galaxy clusters, we are able to constrain baryonic parameters and learn more
about feedback and cosmology. In particular, we use cluster gas fractions from
X-ray data and gas profiles from kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) observations
to provide evidence for baryonic feedback that is stronger than predicted by
most hydrodynamical simulations. In terms of the matter power spectrum, we
report a beyond-percent effect at wave-modes above $k\sim 0.1-0.45$ h/Mpc and a
maximum suppression of $12-33$ percent at $k\sim7$ h/Mpc (68 percent confidence
level). Regarding the combined parameter
$\Sigma_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.58}$, we find the known tension with the
Planck satellite data to be reduced from 3.8 to 2.9 $\sigma$ once baryonic
effects are fully included in the analysis pipeline. The tension is further
decreased to 2.6 $\sigma$ when the weak-lensing data is combined with X-ray and
kSZ observations. We conclude that, while baryonic feedback effects become more
important in modern weak-lensing surveys, they are unlikely to act as the main
culprit for the observed $\Sigma_8$-tension.

that this white dwarf is in a 4.61 hr orbit with an unseen >0.4 solar-mass
companion and has Teff = 9230 +/- 100 K and log(g) = 6.627 +/- 0.056, which
corresponds to a mass of 0.191 +/- 0.013 solar mass. Patterns in the TESS
pulsation frequencies from rotational splittings appear to reveal a stellar
rotation period of roughly 10 hr, making GD 278 the first ELM white dwarf with
a measured rotation rate. The patterns inform our mode identification for
asteroseismic fits, which unfortunately do not reveal a global best-fit
solution. Asteroseismology reveals two main solutions roughly consistent with
the spectroscopic parameters of this ELM white dwarf, but with vastly different
hydrogen-layer masses; future seismic fits could be further improved by using
the stellar parallax. GD 278 is now the tenth known pulsating ELM white dwarf;
it is only the fifth known to be in a short-period binary, but is the first

SF cluster galaxies with R<R200 were found to be enhanced with respect to the
MZR of coeval field SF galaxies. This metallicity enhancement is limited to
lower-mass satellites of the 9 clusters with a passive BCG. Many of the SF

phase-space diagram expected for virialized populations. We find a higher
fraction of higher mass SF galaxies at R<R500 in clusters with active BCGs
compared to clusters with passive BCGs, a signal for galactic conformity. In
contrast, much higher fractions of AGNs and especially recently quenched
galaxies (RQGs) at R<R500 are found in clusters with passive BCGs in comparison
to clusters with active BCGs. We deduce that strangulation is initiated in
clusters with passive BCGs when SF satellite galaxies pass R200, by stopping
the pristine gas inflow which would otherwise dilute the ISM and would maintain
their metallicities at values similar to those of field galaxies at similar
redshifts. For galaxies with higher masses which survived to be SF when
travelling to R<R500 of clusters with passive BCGs, we assume that they suffer
a rapid quenching of star formation, likely due to AGNs triggered by the
increasing RPS toward the cluster center, which can compress the gas and fuel
AGNs; these AGNs can rapidly quench and maintain quenched satellite galaxies.
On the other hand, we found that surviving SF massive satellite galaxies around
active BCGs are less affected by environment when they enter R<R500, since we
observe R<R500 SF galaxies with higher masses and with metallicities typical of
coeval field galaxies. This observed galactic conformity implies that active
BCGs must maintain their activity over timescales of at least ~1Gyr.

particle mediating the scattering process has a mass that is small in
comparison to the momentum transfer in scattering events, correctly
incorporating the thermal motion of target particles results in a quadratic,
rather than logarithmic, sensitivity to the mediator mass, which substantially
enhances the capture rate. We quantitatively assess the impact of this finite
temperature effect on the captured DM population in the Sun as a function of
mediator mass. We find that capture of DM through light dark photons, as in
e.g. mirror DM, can be powerfully enhanced, with self-capture attaining a
geometric limit over much of parameter space. For visibly-decaying dark
photons, thermal corrections are not large in the Sun, but may be important in
understanding long-range DM capture in more massive bodies such as Population
III stars. We additionally provide the first calculation of the long-range DM

account for the effects of dust, and we measure galaxy structural parameters by
fitting S\'ersic models to the images with Galfit. We find that the derived
$r$-band half-light radii differ systematically from the stellar half-mass

as much as $\approx0.5$ dex. The magnitude of this size discrepancy depends
strongly on the dust attenuation and star formation activity within the galaxy,

0.1 dex), and the slope and scatter of the local mass-size relation are

consider a mirror-world-like model where the pNGBs are composite states of
fundamental fermions, the question of Fermi repulsion in the high density bulk
of the Q-ball plays a central role in determining its properties. The main
effect is that when the parameter controlling the Fermi repulsion increases
beyond a critical value, the radius of the Q-ball increase and continues to
increase while the Q-ball becomes more weakly bound. As a result, there are
Q-ball solutions with radii well exceeding a femtometer which would interact
with nuclei in direct detection experiments via momentum-dependent form factors
making their signatures striking. We leave the question of the production and

the band-averaged CO-galaxy cross-power of $P_x<540$ uK Mpc$^3$/h$^3$. Our
measurement favors a non-zero mean CO brightness temperature at around 90%
confidence and gives an upper limit on the mean molecular gas density at z~2.6
of $7.7 \times 10^8$ Msun/Mpc$^3$. We forecast the expected cross-power
spectrum by applying a number of literature prescriptions for the CO luminosity
to halo mass relation to a suite of mock light cones. Under the most optimistic
forecasts the cross-spectrum could be detected with only moderate extensions of
the data used here, while more conservative models could be detected with a
factor of 10 increase in sensitivity. Ongoing CO intensity mapping experiments
will target fields allowing extensive cross correlation analysis and should
reach the sensitivity required to detect the cross-spectrum signal.

analysis of gravitational waves generated by compact binary systems, we
complete the analytical derivation of the source type mass quadrupole moment of
compact binaries (without spins) at the fourth PN order of general relativity.
Similarly to the case of the conservative 4PN equations of motion, we show that
the quadrupole moment at that order contains a non-local (in time)
contribution, arising from the tail-transported interaction entering the
conservative part of the dynamics. Furthermore, we investigate the infra-red
(IR) divergences of the quadrupole moment. In a previous work, this moment has
been computed using a Hadamard partie finie procedure for the IR divergences,
but the knowledge of the conservative equations of motion indicates that those
divergences have to be dealt with by means of dimensional regularization. This
work thus derives the difference between the two regularization schemes, which
has to be added on top of the previous result. We show that unphysical IR poles
start to appear at the 3PN order, and we determine all of these up to the 4PN
order. In particular, the non-local tail term comes in along with a specific
pole at the 4PN order. It will be proven in a companion paper that the poles in
the source-type quadrupole are cancelled in the physical radiative type
quadrupole moment measured at future null infinity.

expansion in the chemical potential is frequently used for lattice gauge theory

new resummation scheme was proposed for such an expansion that resums
contributions of correlation functions of conserved currents to all orders in
the chemical potential. Here, we study the efficacy of this resummation scheme
using a solvable low energy model, namely the mean-field quark-meson model.
After adapting the scheme for a mean-field analysis, we confront the results of
this scheme with the direct solution of the model at finite density as well as
compare with results from Taylor expansions. We study to what extent the two
methods capture the analytical properties of the equation of state in the
complex chemical potential plane. As expected, the Taylor expansion breaks down
as soon as the baryon chemical potential reaches the radius of convergence
defined by the Yang-Lee edge singularity. Encouragingly, the resummation not
only captures the location of the Yang-Lee edge singularity accurately, but is
also able to describe the equation of state for larger chemical potentials
beyond the location of the edge singularity for a wide range of temperatures.

coverage to uniquely constrain the stellar and planetary spectral components
from spatially unresolved observations. We performed simultaneous retrievals of
stellar and planetary spectra for the archetypal planet WASP-43b in its
original configuration and a non-transiting configuration to determine the
efficacy of the PIE technique for characterizing the planet's nightside
atmospheric thermal structure and composition using typical out-of-transit JWST
observations. We found that using PIE with JWST should enable the stellar and
planetary spectra to be disentangled with no degeneracies seen between the two
flux sources, thus allowing robust constraints on the planet's nightside
thermal structure and water abundance to be retrieved. The broad wavelength
coverage achieved by combining spectra from NIRISS, NIRSpec, and MIRI enables
PIE retrievals that are within 10% of the precision attained using traditional
secondary eclipse measurements, although mid-IR observations with MIRI alone
may face up to 3.5 times lower precision on the planet's irradiation
temperature. For non-transiting planets with unconstrained radius priors, we
were able to identify and break the degeneracy between planet radius and
irradiation temperature using data that resolved the peak of both the stellar
and planetary spectra, thus potentially increasing the number of planets
amenable to atmospheric characterization with JWST and other future mission

to many pursuits within Galactic archaeology. However, measuring the chemical
likeness of stars using abundances directly is limited by systematic imprints
of imperfect synthetic spectra in abundance derivation. We present a novel
data-driven model that is capable of identifying chemically similar stars from
spectra alone. We call this Relevant Scaled Component Analysis (RSCA). RSCA
finds a mapping from stellar spectra to a representation that optimizes
recovery of known open clusters. By design, RSCA amplifies factors of chemical
abundance variation and minimizes those of non-chemical parameters, such as
instrument systematics. The resultant representation of stellar spectra can
therefore be used for precise measurements of chemical similarity between
stars. We validate RSCA using 185 cluster stars in 22 open clusters in the
APOGEE survey. We quantify our performance in measuring chemical similarity
using a reference set of 151,145 field stars. We find that our representation
identifies known stellar siblings more effectively than stellar abundance
measurements. Using RSCA, 1.8% of pairs of field stars are as similar as birth
siblings, compared to 2.3% when using stellar abundance labels. We find that
almost all of the information within spectra leveraged by RSCA fits into a
two-dimensional basis, which we link to [Fe/H] and alpha-element abundances. We
conclude that chemical tagging of stars to their birth clusters remains
prohibitive. However, using the spectra has noticeable gain, and our approach
is poised to benefit from larger datasets and improved algorithm designs.

definition of the intermittency factor $\gamma$ based on coherent structures is
introduced to separate turbulent and nonturbulent parts of a flow. Applying

all regions of the ABL - viscous sublayer, buffer layer, inner, and outer

well-separated clusters within the viscous sublayer which can possibly explain

structures are calculated for cuboidal particles with minimum dimension ranging
from 3.7 \r{A} (24 atoms) to 10.3 \r{A} (384 atoms) using a highly-parallel
real-space DFT code to enable hybrid level DFT calculations of larger
nanoparticles than are typically practical. We deconvolute the geometric and
electronic finite size effects in surface energy, and evaluate the influence of
defects on band structure and density of states (DOS). The electronic finite
size effects in surface energy vanish when the minimum length scale of the
nanoparticles becomes greater than 10 \r{A}. We show that this length scale is
consistent with a computationally efficient numerical analysis of the
characteristic length scale of electronic interactions. The surface energy of
nanoparticles having minimum dimension beyond this characteristic length can be
approximated using slab calculations that account for the geometric defects. In
contrast, the finite size effects on the band structure is highly dependent on
the shape and size of these particles. The DOS for cuboidal particles and more
realistic particles constructed using the Wulff algorithm reveal that defect
states within the bandgap play a key role in determining the band structure of
nanoparticles and the bandgap does not converge to the bulk limit for the
particle sizes investigated.

hand orthosis designed for individuals with upper extremity hemiparesis after
stroke. This cable network adds opposition/reposition capabilities to the
thumb, and increases the likelihood of forming a hand pose that can
successfully manipulate objects. In addition to a passive-thumb version (where
both cables are of fixed length), our approach also allows for a
single-actuator active-thumb version (where the extension cable is actuated
while the abductor remains passive), which allows a range of motion intended to
facilitate creating and maintaining grasps. We performed experiments with five
chronic stroke survivors consisting of unimanual resistive-pull tasks and
bimanual twisting tasks with simulated real-world objects; these explored the
effects of thumb assistance on grasp stability and functional range of motion.
Our results show that both active- and passive-thumb versions achieved similar
performance in terms of improving grasp force generation over a no-device
baseline, but active thumb stabilization enabled users to maintain grasps for
longer durations.

AM Sabotage Attack is one kind of kinetic cyberattack that originates from the

By introducing inconspicuous yet damaging alterations in any specific process
of the AM digital process chain, the attackers can compromise the structural
integrity of a manufactured component in a manner that is invisible to a human
observer. If the manufactured objects are critical for their system, those
attacks can even compromise the whole system's structural integrity and pose a
severe safety risk to its users. For example, an inconspicuous void (less than
1 mm in dimension) placed in the 3D design of a tensile test specimen can
reduce its yield load by 14%. However, security studies primarily focus on

their metallicities, in the solar vicinity show ages widely distributed from
0-10 Gyr. This fact matches the orbital history of solar twins in the new
paradigm of galactic dynamics, in which stars radially move on the disk when
they encounter transient spiral arms. This finding suggests that older twins
were born closer to the Galactic center and traveled a longer distance to reach
their present location, according to the hypothesis that chemical enrichment
occurs more quickly and that solar metallicity is attained on a shorter
timescale with a decreasing Galactocentric distance (R_GC). We show that
abundance patterns covering a wide range of heavy elements for solar twins
sharing similar ages are identical and that their variation among different age
groups can be understood on the basis of the age-R_GC connection within the
framework of Galactic chemical evolution. This study identifies the Galactic
bulge as the birthplace of the oldest solar twins. Based on this scheme, we
find that the relation between [r-process/Fe] and R_GC for the inner Galactic
region is incompatible with the hypothesis of a sole site for r-process
production, that is, neutron star mergers, whose delay time distribution could
be approximated by the power-law form (proportional to t^n). Alternatively,
this relation suggests the presence of two distinct sites for r-process
production: short-lived massive stars, ending with specific core-collapse
supernovae, and neutron star mergers that are heavily inclined to emerge with
longer delay times, as represented by n=0-0.5.

oscillating boundary layers on adiabatic abyssal slopes, sloped lake

linear stability analysis. The flow dynamics depend on three non-dimensional
variables: the Reynolds number for Stokes' second problem (Re), the Prandtl

criticality) of the buoyant restoring force and the tidal forcing. The Floquet
analysis results suggest that oscillating laminar boundary layers on adiabatic
abyssal slopes are increasingly unstable as Reynolds number, criticality

that the two-dimensional Floquet linear instability necessarily generates
three-dimensional baroclinic vorticity, which suggests that the evolution of

cylinders), which is systematically varied ($0.098 \leq \phi \leq 1$) by
increasing the number of cylinders in a patch ($N_c$). A point source is placed
at ground level upstream of the patch and its transport around the patch is
examined. Time-averaged velocity and scalar fields, obtained from simultaneous

induce counter-rotating secondary flows, and these are compared to the
large-scale turbulent structures that occur naturally over the smooth wall.
Both appear as meandering elongated high- and low-momentum streaks in the
instantaneous flow field. Results suggest that the secondary flows might be
spanwise-locked turbulent structures, with $S/\overline{\delta}$ governing the
strength of the turbulent structures and possibly the efficacy of the surface
in locking the structures in place (most effective when $S/\overline{\delta}
\approx 1$). Conditional averages of the fluctuating velocity fields of both

strongly reminiscent of the streak-vortex instability model. Secondary flows
and large-scale structures coexist in the limits where either
$S/\overline{\delta} \gg 1$ or $S/\overline{\delta} \ll 1$, where the secondary
flows scale on $\delta$ or $S$, respectively. When $S/\overline{\delta} \gg 1$,
the secondary flows are locked about the roughness transition, while relatively
unaltered large-scale structures occur further from the transition. In the case

In this paper, we develop a distributed privacy-preserving EV charging control
protocol based on secret sharing (SS) that 1) achieves scalability over EV
population size; 2) enjoys higher computation efficiency compared to
homomorphic encryption (HE) based methods; and 3) secures the privacy of the
participating EVs against honest-but-curious adversaries and external
eavesdroppers. The cooperative EV charging control is formulated to achieve
overnight valley-filling and framed into the projected gradient algorithm (PGA)
structure as a distributed optimization problem. SS is integrated into PGA to
achieve secure updates of both primal and dual variables. Theoretical security
analyses and simulations in a residential area are conducted to prove the
privacy preservation guarantee as well as the efficacy and efficiency of the
proposed privacy preservation method. Broadly, the proposed method can be
readily extended to various GER control applications.

serious communication bottleneck for FL. To reduce the communication volume,
techniques such as model compression and quantization have been proposed.
Besides the fixed-bit quantization, existing adaptive quantization schemes use
ascending-trend quantization, where the quantization level increases with the
training stages. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of quantization
on model convergence, and show that the optimal quantization level is directly
related to the range of the model updates. Given the model is supposed to
converge with the progress of the training, the range of the model updates will
gradually shrink, indicating that the quantization level should decrease with
the training stages. Based on the theoretical analysis, a descending
quantization scheme named FedDQ is proposed. Experimental results show that the
proposed descending quantization scheme can save up to 65.2% of the
communicated bit volume and up to 68% of the communication rounds, when

importantly, it is not clearly interpretable, given that the measure can take
relatively large values on partitions of random networks without communities.
Here we propose a new measure based on the concept of robustness: modularity is
the probability to find trivial partitions when the structure of the network is
randomly perturbed. This concept can be implemented for any clustering
algorithm capable of telling when a group structure is absent. Tests on
artificial and real graphs reveal that robustness modularity can be used to
assess and compare the strength of the community structure of different

Yet, in situations where direct voting systems are infeasible, such as due to
high implementation and infrastructure costs, hierarchical voting systems
provide a reasonable alternative. We study differences in outcome precision
between hierarchical and direct voting systems for varying group sizes,
abstention rates, and voter competencies. Using asymptotic expansions of the
derivative of the reliability function (or Banzhaf number), we first prove that
indirect systems differ most from their direct counterparts when group size and
number are equal to each other, and therefore to $\sqrt{N_{\rm d}}$, where
$N_{\rm d}$ is the total number of voters in the direct system. In multitier

$\sqrt[n]{N_{\rm d}}$, where $n$ is the number of hierarchical levels. Second,
we show that while direct majority rule always outperforms hierarchical voting
for homogeneous electorates that vote with certainty, as group numbers and size
increase, hierarchical majority voting gains in its ability to represent all

correlated within groups, hierarchical systems often outperform direct voting,

called totally nonnegative if all its Pl\""ucker coordinates are nonnegative. We
may view each $V_k$ as a subspace of polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ of degree
at most $n-1$, by associating a vector $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to
the polynomial $a_1 + a_2x + \cdots + a_nx^{n-1}$. We show that a complete flag
is totally nonnegative if and only if each of its Wronskian polynomials
$Wr(V_k)$ is nonzero on the interval $(0, \infty)$. In the language of
Chebyshev systems, this means that the flag forms a Markov system or ECT-system
on $(0, \infty)$. This gives a new characterization and membership test for the
totally nonnegative flag variety. Similarly, we show that a complete flag is
totally positive if and only if each $Wr(V_k)$ is nonzero on $[0, \infty]$. We
use these results to show that a conjecture of Eremenko (2015) in real Schubert
calculus is equivalent to the following conjecture: if $V$ is a
finite-dimensional subspace of polynomials such that all complex zeros of
$Wr(V)$ lie in the interval $(-\infty, 0)$, then all Pl\""ucker coordinates of
$V$ are real and positive. This conjecture is a totally positive strengthening
of a result of Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko (2009), and can be reformulated
as saying that all complex solutions to a certain family of Schubert problems
in the Grassmannian are real and totally positive. We also show that our
conjecture is equivalent to a totally positive strengthening of the secant
conjecture (2012).

given prerecorded trajectories. Many current approaches customize existing
off-policy RL algorithms, especially actor-critic algorithms in which policy
evaluation and improvement are iterated. However, the convergence of such
approaches is not guaranteed due to the use of complex non-linear function
approximation and an intertwined optimization process. By contrast, we propose
a simple baseline algorithm for offline RL that only performs the policy
evaluation step once so that the algorithm does not require complex
stabilization schemes. Since the proposed algorithm is not likely to converge
to an optimal policy, it is an appropriate baseline for actor-critic algorithms
that ought to be outperformed if there is indeed value in iterative
optimization in the offline setting. Surprisingly, we empirically find that the
proposed algorithm exhibits competitive and sometimes even state-of-the-art
performance in a subset of the D4RL offline RL benchmark. This result suggests
that future work is needed to fully exploit the potential advantages of
iterative optimization in order to justify the reduced stability of such

LaScO3/BaSnO3 (LSO/BSO) interface with a room-temperature mobility of 60 cm2/V
s at a carrier concentration of 1.7x1013 cm-2. This is an order of magnitude
higher mobility at room temperature than achieved in SrTiO3-based 2DEGs. We
achieved this by combining a thick BSO buffer layer with an ex-situ
high-temperature treatment, which not only reduces the dislocation density but
also produces a SnO2-terminated atomically flat surface, followed by the growth
of an overlying BSO/LSO interface. Using weak-beam dark field imaging and
in-line electron holography technique, we reveal a reduction of the threading
dislocation density, and provide direct evidence for the spatial confinement of
a 2DEG at the BSO/LSO interface. Our work opens a new pathway to explore the
exciting physics of stannate-based 2DEGs at application-relevant temperatures

hotspots with large intermediate data on temporary storage, longer job recovery
time after failures, and worse query optimizer estimates being examples of
issues that we are facing at Microsoft.
  To address these issues, we propose Phoebe, an efficient learning-based
checkpoint optimizer. Given a set of constraints and an objective function at
compile-time, Phoebe is able to determine the decomposition of job plans, and
the optimal set of checkpoints to preserve their outputs to durable global
storage. Phoebe consists of three machine learning predictors and one
optimization module. For each stage of a job, Phoebe makes accurate predictions
for: (1) the execution time, (2) the output size, and (3) the start/end time
taking into account the inter-stage dependencies. Using these predictions, we
formulate checkpoint optimization as an integer programming problem and propose
a scalable heuristic algorithm that meets the latency requirement of the
production environment.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Phoebe in production workloads, and show
that we can free the temporary storage on hotspots by more than 70% and restart
failed jobs 68% faster on average with minimum performance impact. Phoebe also
illustrates that adding multiple sets of checkpoints is not cost-efficient,
which dramatically reduces the complexity of the optimization.

native myocardial T1 and T2 mapping using Cartesian sampling. Methods: The
proposed technique (Multimapping) consisted of single-shot Cartesian image
acquisitions in 10 consecutive cardiac cycles, with inversion pulses in cycle 1
and 5, and T2 preparation (TE: 30ms, 50ms and 70ms) in cycles 8-10.
Multimapping was simulated for different T1 and T2, where entries corresponding
to the k-space centers were matched to acquired data. Experiments were
performed in a phantom, 16 healthy subjects and three patients with
cardiovascular disease. Results: Multimapping phantom measurements showed good
agreement with reference values for both T1 and T2, with no discernable
heart-rate dependency for T1 and T2 within the range of myocardium. In vivo
mean T1 in healthy subjects was significantly higher using Multimapping
(T1=1114+/-14ms) compared to the reference (T1=991+/-26ms) (p<0.01). Mean
Multimapping T2 (47.1+/-1.3ms) and T2 spatial variability (5.8+/-1.0ms) was
significantly lower compared to the reference (T2=54.7+/-2.2ms, p<0.001;
spatial variability=8.4+/-2.0ms, p<0.01). Increased T1 and T2 was detected in
all patients using Multimapping. Conclusions: Multimapping allows for
simultaneous native myocardial T1 and T2 mapping with a conventional Cartesian
trajectory, demonstrating promising in vivo image quality and parameter
quantification results.

outside it recessional velocities are naturally large compared to the speed of
light. The de Sitter group of isometries, after the limit, becomes the
conformal group in Euclidean flat space. We also study the Carroll limit of

Inclusion of atomic interactions with neutrals breaks the functional structure

Crank-Nicolson method, one approach is to time-center the atomic interactions
in the linear solver and use a Newton method to include the nonlinear

operator-splitting the terms associated with the atomic interactions using a
Strang-splitting technique. These methods naturally break equations into

effective in reducing the time-discretization error to be comparable to that of
Crank-Nicolson with Newton iteration of the nonlinear terms. Splitting ODE and

confidence-aware majority voting technique. The final pose estimates are
attained from a novel optimization scheme which links high-confidence
multi-view 2D observations and 3D joint candidates. Moreover, a statistical
parametric body model such as SMPL is leveraged as a regularizing prior for

optimized jointly in an alternating fashion. Here the parametric models help in
correcting implausible 3D pose estimates and filling in missing joint
detections while updated 3D poses in turn guide obtaining better SMPL

generalizes to different data sources because it better decouples the final 3D

$N/2$ pairwise comparisons (queries per sample) on average. We consider a

that, depending on the flow parameters (particle and system size, initial
volume fraction), the early stress response of the suspension may strongly
differ from the prediction of the Suspension Balance Model based on the
steady-state rheology. We show that a two-phase model incorporating the
Reynolds-like dilatancy law of Pailha & Pouliquen (2009), which prescribes the
dilation rate of the suspension over a strain scale $\gamma_0$, quantitatively
captures the suspension dilation/compaction over the whole range of parameters
investigated. Together with the Darcy flow induced by the pore pressure
gradient during dilation or compaction, this Reynolds-like dilatancy implies
that the early stress response of the suspension is nonlocal, with a nonlocal
length scale $\ell$ which scales with the particle size and diverges
algebraically at jamming. In regions affected by $\ell$, the stress level is
fixed, not by the steady-state rheology, but by the Darcy fluid pressure
gradient resulting from the dilation/compaction rate. Our results extend the
validity of the Reynolds-like dilatancy flow rule, initially proposed for
jammed suspensions, to flowing suspension below $\phi_\mathrm{c}$, thereby
providing a unified framework to describe dilation and shear-induced migration.

trajectory prediction. Existing approaches explore the discrete nature of human
intent before predicting continuous trajectories, to improve accuracy and
support explainability. However, these approaches often assume the intent to
remain fixed over the prediction horizon, which is problematic in practice,
especially over longer horizons. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
HYPER, a general and expressive hybrid prediction framework that models
evolving human intent. By modeling traffic agents as a hybrid
discrete-continuous system, our approach is capable of predicting discrete
intent changes over time. We learn the probabilistic hybrid model via a maximum
likelihood estimation problem and leverage neural proposal distributions to
sample adaptively from the exponentially growing discrete space. The overall
approach affords a better trade-off between accuracy and coverage. We train and
validate our model on the Argoverse dataset, and demonstrate its effectiveness
through comprehensive ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art
models.

  Learning using Segmental Contrastive Predictive Coding","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2106.02170",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Typically, unsupervised segmentation of speech into the phone and word-like
units are treated as separate tasks and are often done via different methods
which do not fully leverage the inter-dependence of the two tasks. Here, we
unify them and propose a technique that can jointly perform both, showing that
these two tasks indeed benefit from each other. Recent attempts employ
self-supervised learning, such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC), where
the next frame is predicted given past context. However, CPC only looks at the
audio signal's frame-level structure. We overcome this limitation with a
segmental contrastive predictive coding (SCPC) framework to model the signal
structure at a higher level, e.g., phone level. A convolutional neural network
learns frame-level representation from the raw waveform via noise-contrastive
estimation (NCE). A differentiable boundary detector finds variable-length
segments, which are then used to optimize a segment encoder via NCE to learn
segment representations. The differentiable boundary detector allows us to
train frame-level and segment-level encoders jointly. Experiments show that our
single model outperforms existing phone and word segmentation methods on TIMIT
and Buckeye datasets. We discover that phone class impacts the boundary
detection performance, and the boundaries between successive vowels or
semivowels are the most difficult to identify. Finally, we use SCPC to extract
speech features at the segment level rather than at uniformly spaced frame
level (e.g., 10 ms) and produce variable rate representations that change
according to the contents of the utterance. We can lower the feature extraction
rate from the typical 100 Hz to as low as 14.5 Hz on average while still
outperforming the MFCC features on the linear phone classification task.

promising constituent of photonic quantum technologies. They are known for the
ability to generate discrete photonic states on-demand with low multiphoton
emission, near-unity entanglement fidelity, and high single photon
indistinguishability. However, quantum dots typically suffer from luminescence
blinking, lowering the efficiency of the source and hampering their scalable
application in quantum networks. In this paper, we investigate and adjust the
intermittence of the neutral exciton emission in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot
under two-photon resonant excitation of the neutral biexciton. We investigate
the spectral and quantum optical response of the quantum dot emission to an
additional wavelength tunable gate laser, revealing blinking caused by the
intrinsic Coulomb blockade due to charge capture processes. Our finding
demonstrates that the emission quenching can be actively suppressed by
controlling the balance of free electrons and holes in the vicinity of the
quantum dot and thereby significantly increasing the quantum efficiency by 30%.

signal should terminate abruptly at the moment of BH formation, after a phase
of steady accretion. Since neutrinos are expected to reach Earth hours before
the electromagnetic signal, the combined detection of the neutrino burst
through multiple neutrino telescopes could allow to promptly determine the
angular location of a nearby stellar collapse in the sky with high precision.
In this paper, we contrast the triangulation pointing procedure that relies on
the rise time of the neutrino curve, often considered in the literature, to the
one that takes advantage of the cutoff of the neutrino curve at the moment of
BH formation. By forecasting the neutrino signal expected in the IceCube
Neutrino Observatory, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE, we devise a strategy to
optimize the identification of the rise and cutoff time of the neutrino curve.
We show that the triangulation method developed by employing the end tail of
the neutrino curve allows to achieve at least one order of magnitude
improvement in the pointing precision for a galactic burst, while being
insensitive to the neutrino mixing scenario. The triangulation pointing method
based on the cutoff of the neutrino curve will also guarantee a better
performance for BH forming collapses occurring beyond our own Galaxy.

to study a van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$. We find that long-range
N\'eel antiferromagnetic order develops from the bulk crystal down to the
bilayer, while it is absent in the monolayer. Before entering the long-range
antiferromagnetic ordered phase in all samples, an upturn of the second
harmonic generation below 200 K indicates the formation of the short-range
order and magneto-elastic coupling. We also directly image the two antiphase
(180$^{\circ}$) antiferromagnetic domains and thermally-induced domain
switching down to bilayer. An anomalous mirror symmetry breaking shows up in
samples thinner than ten layers for the temperature both above and below the
N\'eel temperature, which indicates a structural change in few-layer samples.
Minimal change of the second harmonic generation polar patterns in strain
tuning experiments indicate that the symmetry crossover at ten layers is most
likely an intrinsic property of MnPS$_3$ instead of an extrinsic origin of
substrate-induced strain. Our results show that second harmonic generation
microscopy is a direct tool for studying antiferromagnetic domains in
atomically thin materials, and opens a new way to study two-dimensional
antiferromagnets.

  IceCube Experiment, and a Global Picture","PhD Thesis",,,,"hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Longstanding anomalies in neutrino oscillation experiments point to the
existence of a fourth, hypothetical neutrino: the sterile neutrino. Global fits
to a sterile neutrino model find a strong preference for such a model over the
massive neutrino Standard Model. However, the fit results suffer from
inconsistencies between datasets, referred to as tension. This motivates more
complicated models for new physics. This thesis considers a model of unstable
sterile neutrinos, where the heaviest mass state can decay. First, the
phenomenology of unstable sterile neutrinos is explored in the IceCube
experiment, a gigaton neutrino detector located at the South Pole. Second,
global fits to traditional and unstable sterile neutrino models are combined
with one year of data from IceCube. A preference for the unstable sterile
neutrino model is found, as well as a reduction in tension. Lastly, a high
statistics search for unstable sterile neutrinos is performed in IceCube. The
Standard Model is rejected with a $p$-value of 2.8% and the traditional sterile
neutrino model is rejected with a $p$-value of 4.9%. The best-fit point is
$\Delta m_{41}^2 = 6.7^{+3.9}_{-2.5}$ eV$^{2}$, $\sin^2 2 \theta_{24} =
0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $g^2 = 2.5 \pi \pm 1.5 \pi$, where $g$ is the
coupling that mediates the neutrino decay. The best-fit corresponds to a
lifetime of the heaviest neutrino of $\tau_4/m_4 = 6\times 10^{-16}$ s/eV. A
Bayesian analysis finds a best model with similar sterile parameters.

many applications due to its importance in genomic data sequencing and DNA- and

describe new coding methods that allow for unique joint reconstruction of

properties of binary Bh and Dyck strings and that can be extended to
accommodate missing substrings in the pool. As auxiliary results, we obtain the
first known bounds on binary Bh sequences for arbitrary even parameters h, and
also describe various error models inherent to mass spectrometry analysis. This

  Markov games",,,,,"cs.GT cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often modeled using the
framework of Markov games (also called stochastic games or dynamic games). Most
of the existing literature on MARL concentrates on zero-sum Markov games but is
not applicable to general-sum Markov games. It is known that the best-response
dynamics in general-sum Markov games are not a contraction. Therefore,
different equilibria in general-sum Markov games can have different values.
Moreover, the Q-function is not sufficient to completely characterize the
equilibrium. Given these challenges, model based learning is an attractive
approach for MARL in general-sum Markov games.
  In this paper, we investigate the fundamental question of \emph{sample
complexity} for model-based MARL algorithms in general-sum Markov games. We
show two results. We first use Hoeffding inequality based bounds to show that
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}( (1-\gamma)^{-4} \alpha^{-2})$ samples per state-action
pair are sufficient to obtain a $\alpha$-approximate Markov perfect equilibrium
with high probability, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and the
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ notation hides logarithmic terms. We then use
Bernstein inequality based bounds to show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(
(1-\gamma)^{-1} \alpha^{-2} )$ samples are sufficient. To obtain these results,
we study the robustness of Markov perfect equilibrium to model approximations.
We show that the Markov perfect equilibrium of an approximate (or perturbed)
game is always an approximate Markov perfect equilibrium of the original game
and provide explicit bounds on the approximation error. We illustrate the
results via a numerical example.

in certain cardiovascular diseases, and thus needs to be closely studied. A
multiphase model of blood flow allows the resolution of locally varying density
of red blood cells within a complex vessel geometrical domain, and haemodynamic
consequences of such build up. Methods: A novel computational fluid dynamics
solver for simulating multiphase flows is used for modelling blood flow using
level set for a sharp interface representation. Single-phase simulations and
reduced order models are used for pressure comparisons. The new solver is used
for numerically studying AHA type B lesions. The impact of hematocrit and
degree of stenosis on the haemodynamics of coronary arteries is investigated.
Results: The comparisons with single-phase flow simulations indicate
differences in pressure when considering red blood cell aggregation. Multiphase
simulations provide slightly lower pressure drop for the same stenosis severity
compared to the single-phase simulations. Secondary flow patterns and the
interactions between the two phases leads to the red blood cell aggregation at
the end of the diastole cycle, which significantly changes the red blood cell
distribution, the shear stresses and velocity in tubular lesions. Conclusions:
Neither pressure drop nor mean velocity are not strongly changed in the
multiphase modelling, but particle buildup significantly changes which is only
revealed by the multiphase approach.

spectrum from several non-uniformly sampled data sets, where each data set is
assumed to have its own, possibly disjoint, and only partially known, sampling
times. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated using a spectral
estimation problem in paleoclimatology. In this problem, each data point
derives from a separate ice core measurement, resulting in that even though all
measurements reflect the same periodicities, the sampling times and phases
differ among the data sets. In addition, sampling times are only approximately
known. The resulting joint estimate exploiting all available data is formulated
using a sparse reconstruction framework allowing for a reliable and robust
estimate of the underlying periodicities. The corresponding misspecified
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound, accounting for the expected sampling uncertainties,
is derived and the proposed method is shown to attain the resulting bound when
the signal to noise ratio is sufficiently high. The performance of the proposed
method is illustrated as compared to other commonly used approaches using both
simulated and measured ice core data sets.

critical to design market structures that enable smooth integration of DERs. A
hierarchical local electricity market (LEM) structure is proposed in this paper
with a secondary market (SM) at the lower level representing secondary feeders
and a primary market (PM) at the upper level, representing primary feeders, in
order to effectively use DERs to increase grid efficiency and resilience. The
lower level SM enforces budget, power balance and flexibility constraints and
accounts for costs related to consumers, such as their disutility, flexibility
limits, and commitment reliability, while the upper level PM enforces power
physics constraints such as power balance and capacity limits, and also
minimizes line losses. The hierarchical LEM is extensively evaluated using a
modified IEEE-123 bus with high DER penetration, with each primary feeder
consisting of at least three secondary feeders. Data from a GridLAB-D model is
used to emulate realistic power injections and load profiles over the course of
24 hours. The performance of the LEM is illustrated by delineating the family
of power-injection profiles across the primary and secondary feeders as well as
corresponding local electricity tariffs that vary across the distribution grid.
Together, it represents an overall framework for a Distribution System Operator
(DSO) who can provide the oversight for the entire LEM.

canonical set of images is used to generate adversarial examples through
potentially multiple attacks. Such transformed images are processed by a set of

the initial transformations. To our knowledge, this is the first use of a
mixture-based adversarially trained system as a defense mechanism. We show that
it is possible to train such a system without supervision, simultaneously on
multiple adversarial attacks. Our system is able to recover class information
for previously-unseen examples with neither attack nor data labels on the MNIST
dataset. The results demonstrate that this multi-attack approach is competitive
with adversarial defenses tested in single-attack settings.

embedded in such models provides a useful inductive bias, not just on
traditional NLP tasks, but also in the nontraditional task of training a
symbolic reasoning engine. We observe that these engines learn quickly and
generalize in a natural way that reflects human intuition. For example,
training such a system to model block-stacking might naturally generalize to
stacking other types of objects because of structure in the real world that has
been partially captured by the language describing it. We study several
abstract textual reasoning tasks, such as object manipulation and navigation,
and demonstrate multiple types of generalization to novel scenarios and the
symbols that comprise them. We also demonstrate the surprising utility of
\textit{compositional learning}, where a learner dedicated to mastering a
complicated task gains an advantage by training on relevant simpler tasks
instead of jumping straight to the complicated task.

radar-communication (DFRC) base station detects the radar-centric users

R-user and to the communication-centric user (C-user). In particular, the
multicast information is intended for both the R- and C-users, whereas the
unicast information is only intended for the C-user. More explicitly, NOMA is
employed to facilitate this double spectrum sharing, where the multicast and
unicast signals are superimposed in the power domain and the superimposed
communication signals are also exploited as radar probing waveforms. First, a
beamformer-based NOMA-aided joint Rad-MU-Com framework is proposed for the
system having a single R-user and a single C-user. Based on this framework, the
unicast rate maximization problem is formulated by optimizing the beamformers
employed, while satisfying the rate requirement of multicast and the predefined
accuracy of the radar beam pattern. The resultant non-convex optimization
problem is solved by a penalty-based iterative algorithm to find a high-quality
near-optimal solution. Next, the system is extended to the scenario of multiple
pairs of R- and C-users, where a cluster-based NOMA-aided joint Rad-MU-Com

optimization problem is formulated for the maximization of the sum of the
unicast rate at each C-user, subject to the constraints on both the minimum
multicast rate for each R&C pair and on accuracy of the radar beam pattern for

compared as a function of the laboratory angle $\theta_{\rm lab}$ ranging from
$18^\circ$ to $60^\circ$ in various folding angle windows. The angular
evolution of the yield ratios of p/d and t/d in coincidence with fission

abundantly emitted at small angles, while protons are more abundant at large
angles. The angular evolution of the neutron richness of the light-charged

configurations. Any quantum circuit can be decomposed into alternating
sequences of 1-qubit unitary gates and CNOT gates. Each CNOT sequence prepares
the current quantum state into a layer of qubit functional configuration to
specify the rule for the next 1-qubit unitary sequence on how to collectively
modify the state vector entries. All the functional configuration layers on a
quantum circuit define its type which can include many other circuits sharing
the same configuration layers. Studying the functional configuration types
allows us to collectively characterize the properties and behaviors of many
quantum circuits. We demonstrate the theory's application to the
hardware-efficient ansatzes of variational quantum algorithms. For potential
applications, the functional configuration theory may allow systematic
understanding and development of quantum algorithms based on their functional

estimating and analyzing heterogeneity in causal effects in observational
studies. However, there usually exists a trade-off between accuracy and

especially in the case when there are a large number of features in estimation.
To make efforts to address the issue, we propose a score-based framework for
estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) function in this

propensity and prognostic scores in a matching algorithm to obtain a proxy of
the heterogeneous treatment effects for each observation, (ii) utilize
non-parametric regression trees to construct an estimator for the CATE function
conditioning on the two scores. The method naturally stratifies treatment
effects into subgroups over a 2d grid whose axis are the propensity and

range, with the range being size-dependent. A temperature clamping scheme for
establishing a metastable nonequilibrium stationary state is detailed and

  of Second Order Thermodynamic Induction",,,"10.1103/PhysRevE.100.022116",,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Development of thermodynamic induction up to second order gives a dynamical
bifurcation for thermodynamic variables and allows for the prediction and
detailed explanation of nonequilibrium phase transitions with associated
spontaneous symmetry breaking. By taking into account nonequilibrium
fluctuations, long range order is analyzed for possible pattern formation.
Consolidation of results up to second order produces thermodynamic potentials
that are maximized by stationary states of the system of interest. These new
potentials differ from the traditional thermodynamic potentials. In particular
a generalized entropy is formulated for the system of interest which becomes
the traditional entropy when thermodynamic equilibrium is restored. This
generalized entropy is maximized by stationary states under nonequilibrium
conditions where the standard entropy for the system of interest is not
maximized. These new nonequilibrium concepts are incorporated into traditional
thermodynamics, such as a revised thermodynamic identity, and a revised
canonical distribution. Detailed analysis shows that the second law of
thermodynamics is never violated even during any pattern formation, thus
solving the entropic coupling problem.
  Examples discussed include pattern formation during phase front propagation
under nonequilibrium conditions and the formation of Turing patterns. The
predictions of second order thermodynamic induction are consistent with both
observational data in the literature as well as the modeling of this data.

a 2 nm thick oxide passivates the surface, corresponding to oxidation of only

domain shift, which leads to performance degradation when applying the deep

propose a multi-scale input along with multiple domain adaptors applied
hierarchically in both feature and output spaces. The proposed training
strategy and novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework, called
Collaborative Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CADA), can effectively overcome
the challenge. Multi-scale inputs can reduce the information loss due to the
pooling layers used in the network for feature extraction, while our proposed
CADA is an interactive paradigm that presents an exquisite collaborative
adaptation through both adversarial learning and ensembling weights at
different network layers. In particular, to produce a better prediction for the
unlabeled target domain data, we simultaneously achieve domain invariance and
model generalizability via adversarial learning at multi-scale outputs from
different levels of network layers and maintaining an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the historical weights during training. Without annotating any
sample from the target domain, multiple adversarial losses in encoder and
decoder layers guide the extraction of domain-invariant features to confuse the
domain classifier. Meanwhile, the ensembling of weights via EMA reduces the
uncertainty of adapting multiple discriminator learning. Comprehensive
experimental results demonstrate that our CADA model incorporating multi-scale
input training can overcome performance degradation and outperform

  Generalization",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite their ability to represent highly expressive functions, deep learning
models seem to find simple solutions that generalize surprisingly well.
Spectral bias -- the tendency of neural networks to prioritize learning low
frequency functions -- is one possible explanation for this phenomenon, but so
far spectral bias has primarily been observed in theoretical models and
simplified experiments. In this work, we propose methodologies for measuring
spectral bias in modern image classification networks on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
We find that these networks indeed exhibit spectral bias, and that
interventions that improve test accuracy on CIFAR-10 tend to produce learned
functions that have higher frequencies overall but lower frequencies in the
vicinity of examples from each class. This trend holds across variation in
training time, model architecture, number of training examples, data
augmentation, and self-distillation. We also explore the connections between
function frequency and image frequency and find that spectral bias is sensitive
to the low frequencies prevalent in natural images. On ImageNet, we find that
learned function frequency also varies with internal class diversity, with

This vortex inherits and develops the conventional noncanonical vortex, i.e.,
it no longer has a constant phase gradient around the center, while the
intensity keeps invariant azimuthally. The strongly focusing properties of the
X-type vortex and its effect on the beam shaping in three-dimensional (3D)
fields are analyzed. The interesting phenomena, which cannot be seen in
canonical vortices, are observed, for instance the 'switch effect' which shows
that the intensity pattern can switch from one transverse axis to another in
the focal plane by controlling the phase gradient parameter. It is shown that
by adjusting the phase gradient of this vortex, the focal field can have
marvelous patterns, from the doughnut shape to the shapes with different lobes,
and the beam along propagation direction will form a twisting shape in 3D space
with controllable rotation direction and location. The physical mechanisms
underlying the rule of the beam shaping are also discussed, which generally say
that the phase gradient of the X-type vortex, the orbital angular momentum, the
polarization and the 'nongeneric' characteristic contribute differently in
shaping fields. This new type of vortex may supply a new freedom for tailoring
3D optical fields, and our work will pave a way for exploration of new vortices
and their applications.

u=Ae_1$ in the periodic tunnel $\Omega=\mathbb T^{d-1}\times(0,1)$ in dimension
$d=2,3$. Consider now the family of solutions $u^\nu$ to the associated
Navier-Stokes equation with the no-slip condition on the flat boundaries, for
small viscosities $\nu=A/\mathsf{Re}$, and initial values in $L^2$. We are
interested in the weak inviscid limits up to subsequences $u^\nu\rightharpoonup
u^\infty$ when both the viscosity $\nu$ converges to 0, and the initial value
$u^\nu_0$ converges to $Ae_1$ in $L^2$. Under a conditional assumption on the
energy dissipation close to the boundary, Kato showed in 1984 that $u^\nu$
converges to $Ae_1$ strongly in $L^2$ uniformly in time under this double
limit. It is still unknown whether this inviscid limit is unconditionally true.
The convex integration method produces solutions $u _E$ to the Euler equation
with the same initial values $Ae_1$ which verify at time $0<T<T_0$:
$\|u_E(T)-Ae_1\|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2\approx A^3T$. This predicts the possibility of
a layer separation with an energy of order $A^3 T$. We show in this paper that
the energy of layer separation associated with any asymptotic $u^\infty$
obtained via double limits cannot be more than $\|u^\infty(T)-Ae_1\|_{L^2
(\Omega)}^2\lesssim A^3T$. This result holds unconditionally for any weak limit
of Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation. Especially, it shows
that, even if the limit is not unique, the shear flow pattern is observable up
to time $1/A$. This provides a notion of stability despite the possible
non-uniqueness of the limit predicted by the convex integration theory. The
result relies on a new boundary vorticity estimate for the Navier-Stokes
equation. This new estimate, inspired by previous work on higher regularity
estimates for Navier-Stokes, provides a nonlinear control scalable through the
inviscid limit.

simulate the dynamics of multiple dust species in a global protoplanetary disk

effectively stir dust grains at scales of the Bondi sphere. Thus the
dust-settling driven by the stellar gravitational potential sets the
latitudinal dust density gradient within the planet envelope. Not only does the
planet's potential enhance this gradient, but also the spiral wakes serve as
another source of asymmetry. These asymmetries substantially alter the inferred
mean Rosseland and Planck opacities. In cases with the moderate-to-strong dust

orders of magnitude between the mid-plane and the polar regions of the Bondi

introduce a transition between optically thick and thin regimes at the scales

the equilibrium scale height of hundred-micron-sized particles is smaller than

long pipe, equipped with the Navier-slip or Navier-Hodge-Lions boundary
condition, are considered in this paper. Three main results are presented.
  First, when equipped with the Navier-slip boundary condition, it is shown
that, $W^{1,\infty}$ axially symmetric solutions with zero flux at one cross
section, must be swirling solutions: $u=(- C x_2, C x_1,0)$, and $x_3-$periodic
solutions must be helical solutions: $u=(-C_1x_2,C_1x_1,C_2)$.
  Second, also equipped with the Navier-slip boundary condition, if the swirl
or vertical component of the axially symmetric solution is independent of the
vertical variable $x_3$, solutions are also proven to be helical solutions. In
the case of the vertical component being independent of $x_3$, the
$W^{1,\infty}$ assumption is not needed. In the case of the swirl component
being independent of $x_3$, the $W^{1,\infty}$ assumption can be relaxed
extensively such that the horizontal radial component of the velocity, $u_r$,
can grow exponentially with respect to the distance to the origin. Also, by
constructing a counterexample, we show that the growing assumption on $u_r$ is
optimal.
  Third, when equipped with the Navier-Hodge-Lions boundary condition, we can
show that if the gradient of the velocity grows sublinearly, then the solution,
enjoying the Liouville-type theorem, is a trivial shear flow: $(0,0,C)$.

designed to assess the effectiveness of intervention for enhancing weight loss
over nine months. The covariates systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) were measured at baseline, month 4, and month 9. At each
assessment time, there were two replicate measurements for SBP and DBP. The
replicate measurement errors of SBP follow different distributions, as does
DBP. To account for the distributional difference of replicate measurement
errors, a new method for analyzing longitudinal data with replicate covariate
measurement errors is developed based on the empirical likelihood method. The
asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are established under some
regularity conditions. The confidence region for the parameters of interest can
be constructed based on the chi-squared approximation without estimating the

asymptotically more efficient than the estimator of Lin et al. (2018).
Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can eliminate the
effects of measurement errors in the covariate and has a high estimation
efficiency. The proposed method indicates the significant effect of the

fermions and antifermions coupled to the vector Abelian-gauge field. In the

appear. To these intermediate states, the space-time explanation on the raison
d'etre of antiparticles by Feynman is applied, then putting on them an
interpretation using antiparticle that all events occur without reversal of
order of events in all inertial systems. Assuming that a common ground-state of
these intermediate states approximate to the true ground-state of the system, a
physical vacuum which realizes dynamical symmetry breaking is derived. In the
physical vacuum, the condensed field-energy of the gauge field determines
fermion's mass, and the condensed kinetic-energy of the massless Fermi field
determines gauge-boson's mass. When a local excitation of the physical vacuum
propagates in space, a Higgs-like boson appears. The Yukawa coupling in the
Higgs model arises from a pair production of massless fermion and anti fermion
from the condensed gauge-field-energy. The effective coupling of this
Higgs-like boson to gauge bosons is calculated as a one-loop process. With this
coupling, the total cross section of the pair annihilation of fermion and anti
fermion to gauge boson pair through this Higgs-like boson is calculated.
Renormalizability of this model is discussed using the inductive method. Since
the Higgs Lagrangian is not assumed, the divergence we must renormalize is only
the logarithmic divergence, not the quadratic one.

different performance metrics (e.g., F1-score, recall) or the performance in
different application scenarios or input domains. In this work, we
systematically generalize performance estimation to a diverse set of metrics

propose the use of post-hoc models to accomplish this goal and investigate
design parameters, including the model type, feature engineering, and
performance metric, to achieve the best estimation quality. Emphasis is given
to object detection problems and, unlike prior work, our approach enables the

black holes and the gravitational wave background from the mergers. Valid as it
is in some interesting scenarios, such as the analysis of the LIGO-Virgo
events, the Peters formula fails to describe the coalescence time if the
orbital period of the binary exceeds the value given by the formula. This could
underestimate the event rate of mergers that occur before the cosmic time
$t\sim 10^{13}\ \text{s}$. As a result, the energy density spectrum of the
gravitational wave background could develop a peak, which is from mergers
occurring at either $t\sim 10^{13}\ \text{s}$ (for black holes with mass
$M\gtrsim 10^8 M_\odot$) or $t\sim 10^{26}(M/M_\odot)^{-5/3}\ \text{s}$ (for
$10^5 M_\odot \lesssim M\lesssim 10^8 M_\odot$). This can be used to constrain
the fraction of dark matter in primordial black holes (denoted by $f$) if

with the result $f\lesssim 10^{-6}\text{-}10^{-4}$ for the mass range

substrate-orbital-filtering effect to generate large-gap QSH systems and
experimentally realized on the epitaxially synthesized ultraflat bismuthene on
Ag(111). Theoretical calculations reveal that the underlying substrate
selectively filters Bi pz orbitals away from the Fermi level, leading pxy
orbitals with nonzero magnetic quantum numbers, resulting in large topological

identified through scanning tunneling spectroscopy combined with density

than 60 years after its discovery, superconductivity in this material is still
not well understood. Using time-domain THz spectroscopy, we measure the
frequency response of the complex optical conductivity of $ \beta- $tungsten

down to 1.6 K, we find that both the superconducting gap and the superfluid
spectral weight are much smaller than that expected for a weakly coupled
superconductor given the T$_c$. The conclusion of a small gap holds up even
when accounting for possible inhomogeneities in the system, which could come
from other crystalline forms of tungsten (that are not superconducting at these
temperatures) or surface states on $ \beta- $tungsten grains. Using detailed
X-ray diffraction measurements, we preclude the possibility of significant

compromise a wide range of downstream NLP tasks in an effective and stealthy

centralized over-the-cloud setting to distributed training over edge devices in
order to strengthen data privacy. An essential but rarely studied challenge in
FL is label deficiency at the edge. This problem is even more pronounced in FL
compared to centralized training due to the fact that FL users are often
reluctant to label their private data. Furthermore, due to the heterogeneous
nature of the data at edge devices, it is crucial to develop personalized
models. In this paper we propose self-supervised federated learning (SSFL), a
unified self-supervised and personalized federated learning framework, and a
series of algorithms under this framework which work towards addressing these
challenges. First, under the SSFL framework, we demonstrate that the standard
FedAvg algorithm is compatible with recent breakthroughs in centralized
self-supervised learning such as SimSiam networks. Moreover, to deal with data
heterogeneity at the edge devices in this framework, we have innovated a series
of algorithms that broaden existing supervised personalization algorithms into
the setting of self-supervised learning. We further propose a novel
personalized federated self-supervised learning algorithm, Per-SSFL, which
balances personalization and consensus by carefully regulating the distance
between the local and global representations of data. To provide a
comprehensive comparative analysis of all proposed algorithms, we also develop
a distributed training system and related evaluation protocol for SSFL. Our
findings show that the gap of evaluation accuracy between supervised learning
and unsupervised learning in FL is both small and reasonable. The performance
comparison indicates the representation regularization-based personalization
method is able to outperform other variants.

and other probabilistic solvers. Strikingly, sIM beats competition-winning SAT
solvers (by 4-700x in runtime to reach 95% accuracy) in solving 3SAT problems.
Even when sampling is made inexact using faster clocks, sIM can find the
correct ground state with further speedup. The problem encoding and
sparsification techniques we introduce can be applied to other Ising Machines

quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead
prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a
random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the
memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead
of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory
size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction,
attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their
organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First,
it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem
apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights--an established approach

the so-called Euler-Maxwell system of equations. In particular, on decomposing
the aforementioned system into its 1 temporal and 1 + 2 spatial components at
the ideal magnetohydrodynamic limit, we bring it in a simplified form that
favors physical insight to the problem of a self-gravitating, magnetized fluid.
Of central interest is the decomposition of Faraday's equation which leads to a
new general solution governing the evolution of the magnetic field during the
motion of the highly conducting fluid. According to the latter relation, the
magnetic field generally grows or decays in proportion to the inverse cube law
of the scale factor--associated with the continuous contraction or expansion of
the fluid's volume respectively. The magnetic field's law of variation, which
has remarkable implications for the motion of the whole fluid, is subsequently
applied to homogeneous (anisotropic-magnetized) cosmological models--especially
to the Bianchi I case--as well as to the study of homogeneous and anisotropic
gravitational collapse in a magnetized environment. Concerning the cosmological
application, we derive the evolution equations of Bianchi I spacetime permeated
by large-scale magnetic fields (these equations reduce to their FRW
counterparts at the small/large--scale limit). Also, the compatibility of the
new evolution formula for the magnetic field with the standard cosmic
nucleosynthesis constraint is examined. As for the application in astrophysics,
our results predict that homogeneous gravitational implosion is impeded when
the electric Weyl tensor (associated with tidal forces) along the magnetic
forcelines overwhelms the magnetic energy density. Lastly, our model denotes
that the satisfaction of the aforementioned criterion is ultimately driven into
a problem of initial conditions.

semantically similar pairs closer than randomly drawn negative samples, which
has been successful in various domains such as vision, language, and graphs.
Recent theoretical studies have attempted to explain the benefit of the large
negative sample size by upper-bounding the downstream classification loss with
the contrastive loss. However, the previous surrogate bounds have two
drawbacks: they are only legitimate for a limited range of negative sample
sizes and prohibitively large even within that range. Due to these drawbacks,
there still does not exist a consensus on how negative sample size
theoretically correlates with downstream classification performance. Following
the simplified setting where positive pairs are drawn from the true
distribution (not generated by data augmentation; as supposed in previous
studies), this study establishes surrogate upper and lower bounds for the
downstream classification loss for all negative sample sizes that best explain
the empirical observations on the negative sample size in the earlier studies.
Our bounds suggest that the contrastive loss can be viewed as a surrogate
objective of the downstream loss and larger negative sample sizes improve
downstream classification because the surrogate gap between contrastive and
supervised losses decays. We verify that our theory is consistent with
experiments on synthetic, vision, and language datasets.

approach to this theory, although unpopular with students and physics
professors. This approach dispenses with the content of thermal machines for
the presentation of the second law of thermodynamics. In this paper, we discuss
Carath\'eodory's formalism historically, and show how Carath\'eodory's axiom of
the second law of thermodynamics is derived, didactically, from the Clausius
principle and the Kelvin principle. In addition, also providing an objective
character for this paper, in the sense of seeking to popularize the teaching of
Carath\'eodory's formalism in disciplines of classical thermodynamics at
undergraduate level, we guide the reader to obtain the entropy and mathematical
content of the second law of thermodynamics through this formalism. Finally,
considering the wide reviewed literature, the proof we gave for deducing the
Carath\'eodory's axiom of the second law of thermodynamics from the Clausius
principle is new.

well-known change-making problem asks for the minimum number of coins that sum
to $t$, assuming an unlimited number of coins in each type. In the more general
all-targets version of the problem, we want the minimum number of coins summing
to $j$, for every $j=0,\ldots,t$. For example, the textbook dynamic programming
algorithms can solve the all-targets problem in $O(nt)$ time. Recently, Chan
and He (SOSA'20) described a number of $O(t\,\textrm{polylog}\,t)$-time
algorithms for the original (single-target) version of the change-making
problem, but not the all-targets version.
  We obtain a number of new results on change-making and related problems,
including:
  1. A new algorithm for the all-targets change-making problem with running
time $\tilde{O}(t^{4/3})$, improving a previous $\tilde{O}(t^{3/2})$-time
algorithm.
  2. A very simple $\tilde{O}(u^2+t)$-time algorithm for the all-targets
change-making problem, where $u$ denotes the maximum coin value. The analysis
of the algorithm uses a theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Graham (1972) on the Frobenius
problem. This algorithm can be extended to solve the all-capacities version of
the unbounded knapsack problem (for integer item weights bounded by $u$).
  3. For the original (single-target) coin changing problem, we describe a
simple modification of one of Chan and He's algorithms that runs in
$\tilde{O}(u)$ time (instead of $\tilde{O}(t)$).
  4. For the original (single-capacity) unbounded knapsack problem, we describe
a simple algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(nu)$ time, improving previous
near-$u^2$-time algorithms.
  5. We also observe how one of our ideas implies a new result on the minimum
word break problem, an optimization version of a string problem studied by
Bringmann et al. (FOCS'17), generalizing change-making (which corresponds to
the unary special case).

non-Gaussian data to be analysed in a generalised linear mixed model framework.
These vastly more general spatial and spatio-temporal models are fitted using
the Laplace approximation via the software TMB. The existing functionality of
FRK is retained with this advance into non-Gaussian models; in particular, it
allows for automatic basis-function construction, it can handle both
point-referenced and areal data simultaneously, and it can predict process
values at any spatial support from these data. This new version of FRK also
allows for the use of a large number of basis functions when modelling the
spatial process, and is thus often able to achieve more accurate predictions
than previous versions of the package in a Gaussian setting. We demonstrate
innovative features in this new version of FRK, highlight its ease of use, and
compare it to alternative packages using both simulated and real data sets.

to the issue of climate change and global warming, which is largely attributed
to the massive quantity of carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, the demand for a
carbon dioxide capture material is massive and continuously increasing. In this
study, we perform first-principle calculations based on density functional
theory to investigate the carbon dioxide capture ability of pristine and doped
beryllonitrene. Our results show that carbon dioxide had an adsorption energy
of -0.046 eV on pristine beryllonitrene, so it appears that beryllonitrene has
extremely weak carbon dioxide adsorption ability. Pristine beryllonitrene could
be effectively doped with Lithium atoms, and the resulting Li-doped
beryllonitrene had much stronger interactions with carbon dioxide than pristine
beryllonitrene. The adsorption energy for carbon dioxide on Li-doped
beryllonitrene was -0.408 eV. The adsorption of carbon dioxide on Li-doped
beryllonitrene greatly changed the charge density, projected density of states,
and band structure of the material, demonstrating that it was strongly
adsorbed. This suggests that Li-doping is a viable way to enhance the carbon
dioxide capture ability of beryllonitrene and makes it a possible candidate for
an effective CO$_2$ capture material.

In this work, we tackle the problem by introducing the Limit-Aware Self-Guiding
Gradient Sliding Attack (LaS-GSA). LaS-GSA follows the Nullifying Attack to
cancel the img2img translation process under a black-box setting. In other
words, by processing input images with the proposed LaS-GSA before publishing,
any targeted img2img GANs can be nullified, preventing the model from
maliciously manipulating the images. To improve efficiency, we introduce the
limit-aware random gradient-free estimation and the gradient sliding mechanism
to estimate the gradient that adheres to the adversarial limit, i.e., the pixel
value limitations of the adversarial example. Theoretical justifications
validate how the above techniques prevent inefficiency caused by the
adversarial limit in both the direction and the step length. Furthermore, an
effective self-guiding prior is extracted solely from the threat model and the
target image to efficiently leverage the prior information and guide the
gradient estimation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaS-GSA
requires fewer queries to nullify the image translation process with higher

requires an extremely high cost to obtain the global optimum even when a
reduced number of users fit into a time slot. Therefore, we propose a heuristic
algorithm yielding good trade-off between performance and computational
complexity, applicable to a static operation framework of geostationary (GEO)

programming, non-convex on a standard form, the solution can be lower bounded
by the global optimum of a geometric program with a hidden convex structure. A
local solution to the joint user scheduling and power allocation problem is
consequently obtained by a successive optimization approach. Numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on large-scale systems by
providing better QoS satisfaction combined with outstanding overall system

known as few-shot image classification, is a challenging task in statistical
machine learning and computer vision. The performance in few-shot
classification suffers from the bias in the estimation of classifier
parameters; however, an effective underlying bias reduction technique that
could alleviate this issue in training few-shot classifiers has been
overlooked. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Firth bias
reduction in few-shot classification. Theoretically, Firth bias reduction
removes the $O(N^{-1})$ first order term from the small-sample bias of the
Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Here we show that the general Firth bias
reduction technique simplifies to encouraging uniform class assignment
probabilities for multinomial logistic classification, and almost has the same
effect in cosine classifiers. We derive an easy-to-implement optimization
objective for Firth penalized multinomial logistic and cosine classifiers,
which is equivalent to penalizing the cross-entropy loss with a KL-divergence
between the uniform label distribution and the predictions. Then, we
empirically evaluate that it is consistently effective across the board for
few-shot image classification, regardless of (1) the feature representations
from different backbones, (2) the number of samples per class, and (3) the
number of classes. Finally, we show the robustness of Firth bias reduction, in

radical cation of the specimen generated by specimen ionization, and three
involve singlet or triplet excited states of the specimen, as initiated by
electron excitation of the CNT followed by energy transfer to the specimen. The
pathways were distinguished by the pre-exponential factor and the Arrhenius

distributed algorithm to locally update personalized PageRank vectors when the
graph topology changes. The proposed algorithm is based on the use of Chebyshev
polynomials and a novel update equation that encompasses a large family of
PageRank-based methods. In particular, the algorithm has the following
advantages: (i) it has faster convergence speed than state-of-the-art
alternatives for local PageRank updating; and (ii) it can update the solution
of recent generalizations of PageRank for which no updating algorithms have
been developed. Experiments in a real-world temporal network of an autonomous

assign sensors so that the entire physical signal can be well recovered from

place sensors. Specifically, assuming that the field signal $\mathbf{f}$ is
represented by a linear model $\mathbf{f}=\pmb{\phi}\mathbf{g}$, it can be
estimated from partial noisy samples via an unbiased least-squares (LS) method,

formulate an approximate MSE problem, and then prove it is equivalent to a
problem related to a principle submatrix of $\pmb{\phi}\pmb{\phi}^\top$ indexed

algorithm with simple matrix-vector multiplications, leveraging a matrix
inverse formula. To further reduce complexity, we reuse results in the previous
greedy step for warm start, so that candidates can be evaluated via lightweight
vector-vector multiplications. Extensive experiments show that our proposed

objective functions (e.g., loss functions) of deep neural networks by
identifying optimal sets of weights and biases. Imposing constraints on weight
precision is often required to alleviate prohibitive workloads on hardware.
Despite the remarkable success of backpropagation, the algorithm itself is not
capable of considering such constraints unless additional algorithms are
applied simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose the constrained
backpropagation (CBP) algorithm based on a pseudo-Lagrange multiplier method to
obtain the optimal set of weights that satisfy a given set of constraints. The
defining characteristic of the proposed CBP algorithm is the utilization of a
Lagrangian function (loss function plus constraint function) as its objective
function. We considered various types of constraints--binary, ternary, one-bit
shift, and two-bit shift weight constraints. As a post-training method, CBP
applied to AlexNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and GoogLeNet on ImageNet, which were
pre-trained using the conventional backpropagation. For all cases, the proposed
algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet, e.g., 66.6%,
74.4%, and 64.0% top-1 accuracy for ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and GoogLeNet with

address diverse constraints with the minimal performance loss by employing
appropriate constraint functions.

parametric-model-based analysis of the abundances of the heavy elements to
understand the origin of the observed abundance pattern. For the first time, we
came across an object with a surface chemical composition that exhibits
contributions from both slow (s) and intermediate (i) neutron-capture
nucleosynthesis. The observed abundance pattern is unique and has never been
observed in any CEMP stars. The star is found to be a CEMP-s star based on the
CEMP stars' classification criteria. However, the observed abundance pattern
could not be explained based on theoretical s-process model predictions. On the
contrary, our parametric-model based analysis clearly indicates its surface
chemical composition being influenced by similar contributions from both the s-
and i-process. We critically examined the observed abundances and carefully
investigated the formation scenarios involving s-process and i-process that are
available in literature, and we found that none of them could explain the
observed abundances. We note that the variation we see in our radial velocity
estimates obtained from several epochs may indicate the presence of a binary
companion. Considering a binary system, we, therefore, propose a formation
scenario for this object involving effective proton ingestion episodes (PIEs)
triggering i-process nucleosynthesis followed by s-process asymptotic giant

Most of the previous analysis assume that the host stars are rigid rotators in
which the amplitude of the RM velocity anomaly is proportional to $v_\star \sin
i_\star$. When their latitudinal differential rotation is taken into account,
one can break the degeneracy, and determine separately the equatorial rotation
velocity $v_\star$ and the inclination $i_{\star}$ of the host star. We derive
a fully analytic approximate formula for the RM effect adopting a parameterized
model for the stellar differential rotation. For those stars that exhibit the
differential rotation similar to that of the Sun, the corresponding RM velocity
modulation amounts to several m/s. We conclude that the latitudinal

present work considers a model describing femtosecond laser inscriptions in a

competition between multi-photon absorptions, radiative recombination and
electron diffusion processes, on temporal profiles of the laser amplitude as
well as of the plasma density. From numerical simulations, it is found that
when the photon number (i.e. K) contributing to multiphoton ionization is large
enough, taking the electron diffusion processes into account favours periodic
structures in temporal profiles both of the laser and the plasma density. The
pulse repetition rate in the optical soliton train is increased with increase

performance of a conventional controller in uncertain environments using deep

motivated by the observation that conventional controllers in industrial motion
control value robustness over adaptivity to deal with different operating
conditions and are suboptimal as a consequence. Reinforcement learning on the
other hand can optimize a control signal directly from input-output data and
thus adapt to operational conditions, but lacks safety guarantees, impeding its
use in industrial environments. To realize adaptive control using reinforcement
learning in such conditions, we follow a residual learning methodology, where a
reinforcement learning algorithm learns corrective adaptations to a base
controller's output to increase optimality. We investigate how constraining the
residual agent's actions enables to leverage the base controller's robustness
to guarantee safe operation. We detail the algorithmic design and propose to
constrain the residual actions relative to the base controller to increase the
method's robustness. Building on Lyapunov stability theory, we prove stability
for a broad class of mechatronic closed-loop systems. We validate our method
experimentally on a slider-crank setup and investigate how the constraints

For a random vector $X\in \mathbb{R}^p$ with expectation $\mu$, testing the
mean vector $H_0: \mu=\mu_0$ vs $H_1: \mu\ne \mu_0$ for a given vector $\mu_0$
is a basic problem in statistics. The centralized test statistics require heavy
communication costs, which can be a burden when $p$ or $k$ is large. To reduce
the communication cost, distributed test statistics are proposed in this paper
for this problem based on the divide and conquer technique, a commonly used
approach for distributed statistical inference. Specifically, we extend two
commonly used centralized test statistics to the distributed ones, that apply
to low and high dimensional cases, respectively. Comparing the power of
centralized test statistics and the distributed ones, it is observed that there
is a fundamental tradeoff between communication costs and the powers of the

technique in many other problems such as estimation, where the associated
distributed statistics can be as good as the centralized ones. Numerical
results confirm the theoretical findings.

problems, namely the Poiseuille-based frictional resistance term used to
parametrise regions of solid and fluid. The traditional model only works for
true topology optimisation, where it is used to approximate solid regions as
areas with very small channel height and, thus, very high frictional
resistance. It will be shown that if the channel height is allowed to vary
continuously and/or the minimum channel height is relatively large and/or
meaning is attributed to intermediate design field values, then the predictions
of the traditional model are wrong. To remedy this problem, this work
introduces an augmentation of the mass conservation equation to allow for
continuously varying channel heights. The proposed planar model accurately
describes fully-developed flow between two plates of varying channel height. It
allows for a significant reduction in the number of degrees-of-freedom, while
generally ensuring a high accuracy for low-to-moderate Reynolds numbers in the
laminar regime. The accuracy and limitations of both the traditional and
proposed models are explored using in-depth parametric studies. The proposed
model is used to optimise the height of the fluid channel between two parallel
plates and, thus, the topography of the plates for a flow distribution problem.
Lastly, it is observed that the proposed model actually produces better
topological designs than the traditional model when applied to the topology
optimisation of a flow manifold.

  Learning","ICLR 2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multilingual models jointly pretrained on multiple languages have achieved
remarkable performance on various multilingual downstream tasks. Moreover,
models finetuned on a single monolingual downstream task have shown to
generalize to unseen languages. In this paper, we first show that it is crucial
for those tasks to align gradients between them in order to maximize knowledge
transfer while minimizing negative transfer. Despite its importance, the
existing methods for gradient alignment either have a completely different
purpose, ignore inter-task alignment, or aim to solve continual learning
problems in rather inefficient ways. As a result of the misaligned gradients
between tasks, the model suffers from severe negative transfer in the form of
catastrophic forgetting of the knowledge acquired from the pretraining. To
overcome the limitations, we propose a simple yet effective method that can
efficiently align gradients between tasks. Specifically, we perform each
inner-optimization by sequentially sampling batches from all the tasks,
followed by a Reptile outer update. Thanks to the gradients aligned between
tasks by our method, the model becomes less vulnerable to negative transfer and
catastrophic forgetting. We extensively validate our method on various
multi-task learning and zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks, where our
method largely outperforms all the relevant baselines we consider.

continuous Gaussian markers while, in an increasing number of studies, the
actual quantity of interest is non-directly measurable; it constitutes a latent
variable evaluated by a set of observed indicators from questionnaires or
measurement scales. Classical examples include anxiety, fatigue, cognition. In
this work,we explain how joint models can be extended to the framework of a
latent quantity measured over time by indicators of different nature (e.g.
continuous, binary, ordinal). The longitudinal submodel describes the evolution
over time of the quantity of interest defined as a latent process in a
structural mixed model, and links the latent process to each observation of the
indicators through appropriate measurement models. Simultaneously, the risk of
multi-cause event is modelled via a proportional cause-specific hazard model
that includes a function of the mixed model elements as linear predictor to
take into account the association between the latent process and the risk of
event. Estimation, carried out in the maximum likelihood framework and
implemented in the R-package JLPM, has been validated by simulations. The
methodology is illustrated in the French cohort on Multiple-System Atrophy

such, a great deal of effort is dedicated to developing methods for noise
reduction. One remarkable achievement in this direction is dynamical
decoupling; it details a clear set of instructions for counteracting the
effects of quantum noise. Yet, the domain of its applicability remains limited
to devices where exercising fast control is possible. In practical terms, this
is highly limiting and there is a growing need for better noise reduction
tools. Here we take a significant step in this direction, by identifying the
crucial ingredients required for noise suppression and the development of
methods that far outperform traditional dynamical decoupling techniques. Using
resource theoretic methods, we show that the key resource responsible for the
efficacy of dynamical decoupling, and related protocols, is non-Markovianity
(or temporal correlations). Using this insight, we then propose two methods to
identify optimal pulse sequences for noise reduction. With an explicit example,
we show that our methods enable a more optimal exploitation of temporal
correlations, and extend the timescales at which noise suppression is viable by
at least two orders of magnitude. Importantly, the corresponding tools are
built on operational grounds and are easily implemented in the current
generation of quantum devices.

objective is a better alternative. The starting point of this paper is the
observation that though Group-DRO performs better than ERM on minority groups
for some benchmark datasets, there are several other datasets where it performs
much worse than ERM. Inspired by ideas from the closely related problem of
domain generalization, this paper proposes a new and simple algorithm that
explicitly encourages learning of features that are shared across various
groups. The key insight behind our proposed algorithm is that while Group-DRO
focuses on groups with worst regularized loss, focusing instead, on groups that
enable better performance even on other groups, could lead to learning of
shared/common features, thereby enhancing minority performance beyond what is
achieved by Group-DRO. Empirically, we show that our proposed algorithm matches
or achieves better performance compared to strong contemporary baselines
including ERM and Group-DRO on standard benchmarks on both minority groups and
across all groups. Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithm is a

and demonstrates very good robustness, accuracy and performance. The new wall
boundary condition treatment is able to improve the high accuracy of its
previous version \citep{ADAMI2012wall} also in complex 3-D and multi-phase

modalities into a common joint visual-textual embedding. However, the most
widely used datasets for this task, MSCOCO and Flickr30K, are actually image
captioning datasets that offer a very limited set of relationships between
images and sentences in their ground-truth annotations. This limited ground
truth information forces us to use evaluation metrics based on binary
relevance: given a sentence query we consider only one image as relevant.
However, many other relevant images or captions may be present in the dataset.
In this work, we propose two metrics that evaluate the degree of semantic
relevance of retrieved items, independently of their annotated binary
relevance. Additionally, we incorporate a novel strategy that uses an image
captioning metric, CIDEr, to define a Semantic Adaptive Margin (SAM) to be
optimized in a standard triplet loss. By incorporating our formulation to
existing models, a \emph{large} improvement is obtained in scenarios where
available training data is limited. We also demonstrate that the performance on
the annotated image-caption pairs is maintained while improving on other
non-annotated relevant items when employing the full training set. Code with
our metrics and adaptive margin formulation will be made public.

describing the electrical activation in the right and left ventricles, in this

coupled nature of potential propagation arising from the interaction between
the network and the myocardium. A set of numerical examples are studied to

capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) intrinsically cope with homogeneous
vehicle fleet, in which the fleet is assumed as repetitions of a single
vehicle. Hence, their key to construct a solution solely lies in the selection
of the next node (customer) to visit excluding the selection of vehicle.
However, vehicles in real-world scenarios are likely to be heterogeneous with
different characteristics that affect their capacity (or travel speed),
rendering existing DRL methods less effective. In this paper, we tackle
heterogeneous CVRP (HCVRP), where vehicles are mainly characterized by
different capacities. We consider both min-max and min-sum objectives for
HCVRP, which aim to minimize the longest or total travel time of the vehicle(s)
in the fleet. To solve those problems, we propose a DRL method based on the
attention mechanism with a vehicle selection decoder accounting for the
heterogeneous fleet constraint and a node selection decoder accounting for the
route construction, which learns to construct a solution by automatically
selecting both a vehicle and a node for this vehicle at each step. Experimental
results based on randomly generated instances show that, with desirable
generalization to various problem sizes, our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art DRL method and most of the conventional heuristics, and also
delivers competitive performance against the state-of-the-art heuristic method,

intriguing, the associated privacy risks are unexplored. In this paper, we
systematically investigate the information leakage of the graph embedding by
mounting three inference attacks. First, we can successfully infer basic graph
properties, such as the number of nodes, the number of edges, and graph
density, of the target graph with up to 0.89 accuracy. Second, given a subgraph
of interest and the graph embedding, we can determine with high confidence that
whether the subgraph is contained in the target graph. For instance, we achieve
0.98 attack AUC on the DD dataset. Third, we propose a novel graph
reconstruction attack that can reconstruct a graph that has similar graph

conversion does not translate to an external gain if the nanomagnet also acts
as the source contact. Regardless of the nanomagnet's position, the spin torque
generated on the TIPNJ is limited by the surface current density, which in turn
is limited by bulk band gap. {Using quantum kinetic models, we calculate the
spatially varying spin potential and quantify the localization of the current
vs applied bias}. Additionally, with the magnetodynamic simulation of a soft
nanomagnet, we show that the PN junction can offer a critical gate tunability
in the switching probability of the nanomagnet, with potential applications in
probabilistic neuromorphic computing.

  Discrepancy",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Unsupervised detection of anomaly points in time series is a challenging
problem, which requires the model to derive a distinguishable criterion.
Previous methods tackle the problem mainly through learning pointwise
representation or pairwise association, however, neither is sufficient to
reason about the intricate dynamics. Recently, Transformers have shown great
power in unified modeling of pointwise representation and pairwise association,
and we find that the self-attention weight distribution of each time point can
embody rich association with the whole series. Our key observation is that due
to the rarity of anomalies, it is extremely difficult to build nontrivial
associations from abnormal points to the whole series, thereby, the anomalies'
associations shall mainly concentrate on their adjacent time points. This
adjacent-concentration bias implies an association-based criterion inherently
distinguishable between normal and abnormal points, which we highlight through
the \emph{Association Discrepancy}. Technically, we propose the \emph{Anomaly
Transformer} with a new \emph{Anomaly-Attention} mechanism to compute the
association discrepancy. A minimax strategy is devised to amplify the
normal-abnormal distinguishability of the association discrepancy. The Anomaly
Transformer achieves state-of-the-art results on six unsupervised time series
anomaly detection benchmarks of three applications: service monitoring, space &
earth exploration, and water treatment.

execute simultaneous model selection and estimation. A popular method is the
LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), the use of which
requires selecting the value of a tuning parameter. This parameter is typically
tuned by minimizing the cross-validation error or Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) but this can be computationally intensive as it involves
fitting an array of different models and selecting the best one. In contrast
with this standard approach, we have developed a procedure based on the
so-called ""smooth IC"" (SIC) in which the tuning parameter is automatically
selected in one step. We also extend this model selection procedure to the
distributional regression framework, which is more flexible than classical
regression modelling. Distributional regression, also known as multiparameter
regression (MPR), introduces flexibility by taking account of the effect of
covariates through multiple distributional parameters simultaneously, e.g.,
mean and variance. These models are useful in the context of normal linear
regression when the process under study exhibits heteroscedastic behaviour.
Reformulating the distributional regression estimation problem in terms of
penalized likelihood enables us to take advantage of the close relationship
between model selection criteria and penalization. Utilizing the SIC is
computationally advantageous, as it obviates the issue of having to choose
multiple tuning parameters.

reinterpreting the process as exploration noise, a stochastic search algorithm
is obtained tailored to (deterministic) trajectory optimisation. For the
purpose of future algorithmic development, it is essential to properly
understand the underlying theoretical foundations that allow for a principled
derivation of such methods. In this paper we make a connection between entropy
regularisation in optimisation and deterministic optimal control. We then show
that the optimal policy is given by a belief function rather than a

the other direction does not. Chiral quantum optics has applications in
creating nanoscopic single-photon routers, circulators, phase-shifters and
two-photon gates. Furthermore, the directional photon-exchange between many
emitters in a chiral system may enable the creation of highly exotic quantum
states. Here, we present a new way of implementing chiral quantum optics $-$ we
use a low-noise quantum dot in an open microcavity. Specifically, we
demonstrate the non-reciprocal absorption of single photons, a single-photon
diode. The non-reciprocity, the ratio of the transmission in the
forward-direction to the transmission in the reverse direction, is as high as
10.7 dB, and is optimised $\textit{in situ}$ by tuning the photon-emitter
coupling to the optimal operating condition ($\beta = 0.5$). Proof that the
non-reciprocity arises from a single quantum emitter lies in the nonlinearity
with increasing input laser power, and in the photon statistics $-$
ultralow-power laser light propagating in the diode's reverse direction results
in a highly bunched output ($g^{(2)}(0) = 101$), showing that the single-photon
component is largely removed. The results pave the way to a single-photon phase

of accelerated ionospheric ions population that forms the lower energy part of

resolution. Then, the engine is based on a U-Net architecture built with
several of those blocks, giving it the ability to process inputs and to output
predictions at different resolutions.
  We have implemented and evaluated the engine on the largest cities in Europe
and the United States, and it clearly outperforms other prediction methods. In
particular, the out-of-sample accuracy remains high, meaning that the engine
can be used in cities which are not included in the training dataset. A
valuable advantage of the engine is that it does not need much computing power:
the forecasts can be built in a few minutes on a standard CPU. Thus, they can
be updated very frequently, as soon as new air quality monitoring stations'
measurements are available (generally every hour), which is not the case of
physical models traditionally used for air quality forecasting.

a genuine tripartite entanglement of cooling-cavity photons, auxiliary-cavity

optomechanical refrigeration and entanglement can be greatly enhanced for the
blue-detuned driving of the auxiliary cavity but suppressed for the red-detuned

  class of delay eigenvalue problems with Hamiltonian symmetry",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we consider a class of delay eigenvalue problems that admit a
spectrum similar to that of a Hamiltonian matrix, in the sense that the
spectrum is symmetric with respect to both the real and imaginary axis. More
precisely, we present a method to iteratively approximate the eigenvalues of
such delay eigenvalue problems closest to a given purely real or imaginary
shift, while preserving the symmetries of the spectrum. To this end the
presented method exploits the equivalence between the considered delay
eigenvalue problem and the eigenvalue problem associated with a linear but
infinite-dimensional operator. To compute the eigenvalues closest to the given
shift, we apply a specifically chosen shift-invert transformation to this
linear operator and compute the eigenvalues with the largest modulus of the new
shifted and inverted operator using an (infinite) Arnoldi procedure. The
advantage of the chosen shift-invert transformation is that the spectrum of the
transformed operator has a ""real skew-Hamiltonian""-like structure. Furthermore,
it is proven that the Krylov space constructed by applying this operator,
satisfies an orthogonality property in terms of a specifically chosen bilinear
form. By taking this property into account during the orthogonalization
process, it is ensured that even in the presence of rounding errors, the
obtained approximation for, e.g., a simple, purely imaginary eigenvalue is
simple and purely imaginary. The presented work can thus be seen as an
extension of [V. Mehrmann and D. Watkins, ""Structure-Preserving Methods for

power, which can be exploited for downstream prediction tasks on
graph-structured data, such as molecules and social networks. They typically
learn representations by aggregating information from the $K$-hop neighborhood
of individual vertices or from the enumerated walks in the graph. Prior studies
have demonstrated the effectiveness of incorporating weighting schemes into
GNNs; however, this has been primarily limited to $K$-hop neighborhood GNNs so
far. In this paper, we aim to design an algorithm incorporating weighting
schemes into walk-aggregating GNNs and analyze their effect. We propose a novel
GNN model, called AWARE, that aggregates information about the walks in the
graph using attention schemes. This leads to an end-to-end supervised learning
method for graph-level prediction tasks in the standard setting where the input
is the adjacency and vertex information of a graph, and the output is a
predicted label for the graph. We then perform theoretical, empirical, and
interpretability analyses of AWARE. Our theoretical analysis in a simplified
setting identifies successful conditions for provable guarantees, demonstrating
how the graph information is encoded in the representation, and how the
weighting schemes in AWARE affect the representation and learning performance.
Our experiments demonstrate the strong performance of AWARE in graph-level
prediction tasks in the standard setting in the domains of molecular property
prediction and social networks. Lastly, our interpretation study illustrates
that AWARE can successfully capture the important substructures of the input
graph. The code is available on

dimensions such as privacy is becoming critical with a far-reaching impact on
the people and society. For example, the various levels of government
legislation and compliance on information privacy worldwide have created a new
era of digital divide in the privacy preservation domain. In this article, the
concept ""digital privacy divide (DPD)"" is introduced to describe the perceived
gap in the privacy preservation of individuals based on the geopolitical
location of different countries. To better understand the DPD phenomenon, we
created an online questionnaire and collected answers from more than 700
respondents from four different countries (the United States, Germany,
Bangladesh, and India) who come from two distinct cultural orientations as per
Hofstede's individualist vs. collectivist society. However, our results
revealed some interesting findings. DPD does not depend on Hofstede's cultural
orientation of the countries. For example, individuals residing in Germany and
Bangladesh share similar privacy concerns, while there is a significant
similarity among individuals residing in the United States and India. Moreover,
while most respondents acknowledge the importance of privacy legislation to
protect their digital privacy, they do not mind their governments to allow
domestic companies and organizations collecting personal data on individuals
residing outside their countries, if there are economic, employment, and crime
prevention benefits. These results suggest a social dilemma in the perceived
privacy preservation, which could be dependent on many other contextual factors
beyond government legislation and countries' cultural orientation.

wide number of applications, including planning and real-time operations.
However, in its original form, the AC Optimal Power Flow problem is often
challenging to solve as it is non-linear and non-convex. Besides the large
number of approximations and relaxations, recent efforts have also been
focusing on Machine Learning approaches, especially neural networks. So far,
however, these approaches have only partially considered the wide number of
physical models available during training. And, more importantly, they have
offered no guarantees about potential constraint violations of their output.
Our approach (i) introduces the AC power flow equations inside neural network

worst-case constraint violations across the entire input domain, while
maintaining the optimality of the prediction. We demonstrate how

been at the forefront of novel and promising cancer treatments over the past
decade and was recognised by the 2018 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Our model
describes the competition between effector T cells and non-effector T cells in
a tumour. By calibrating a small subset of parameters that control immune
checkpoint expression along with the patient's immune-system cancer readiness,
our model is able to simulate either a complete absence of patient response to
treatment, a quick anti-tumour T cell response (within days) or a delayed
response (within months). Notably, the parameter space that generates a delayed
response is thin and must be carefully calibrated, reflecting the observation
that a small subset of patients experience such reactions to checkpoint
blockade therapies. Finally, simulations predict that the anti-tumour T cell
storm that breaks the delay is very short-lived compared to the length of time
the cancer is able to stay suppressed. This suggests the tumour may subsist off
an environment hostile to effector T cells; however, these cells are -- at rare
times -- able to break through the tumour immunosuppressive defences to
neutralise the tumour for a prolonged period. Our simulations aim to
qualitatively describe the delayed response phenomenon without making precise
fits to particular datasets, which are limited. It is our hope that our
foundational model will stimulate further interest within the immunology

LGM framework assumes that the data follow a specific parametric distribution,
whose unknown parameters are transformed using a multivariate link function and
are then further modeled at the latent level in terms of fixed and random
effects that have a joint Gaussian distribution. In the extremal context, we
here assume that the data level distribution is described in terms of a Poisson
point process likelihood, motivated by asymptotic extreme-value theory, and
which conveniently exploits information from all threshold exceedances. This
contrasts with the more common data-wasteful approach based on block maxima,
which are typically modeled with the generalized extreme-value (GEV)
distribution. When conditional independence can be assumed at the data level
and latent random effects have a sparse probabilistic structure, fast
approximate Bayesian inference becomes possible in very high dimensions, and we
here present the recently proposed inference approach called ""Max-and-Smooth"",
which provides exceptional speed-up compared to alternative methods. The
proposed methodology is illustrated by application to satellite-derived
precipitation data over Saudi Arabia, obtained from the Tropical Rainfall

space, astrophysical and laboratory plasma systems, with the outer boundary of
Earth's magnetosphere, the magnetopause, providing an accessible environment to
study them. Like waves on water, magnetopause surface waves are thought to
travel in the direction of the driving solar wind, hence a paradigm in global
magnetospheric dynamics of tailward propagation has been well-established. Here
we show through multi-spacecraft observations, global simulations, and analytic
theory that the lowest-frequency impulsively-excited magnetopause surface
waves, with standing structure along the terrestrial magnetic field, propagate
against the flow outside the boundary. Across a wide local time range (09-15h)
the waves' Poynting flux exactly balances the flow's advective effect, leading
to no net energy flux and thus stationary structure across the field also.
Further down the equatorial flanks, however, advection dominates hence the
waves travel downtail, seeding fluctuations at the resonant frequency which
subsequently grow in amplitude via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and couple
to magnetospheric body waves. This global response, contrary to the accepted
paradigm, has implications on radiation belt, ionospheric, and auroral dynamics
and potential applications to other dynamical systems.

  Software Testing?","12 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Defect predictors, static bug detectors and humans inspecting the code can
locate the parts of the program that are buggy before they are discovered
through testing. Automated test generators such as search-based software
testing (SBST) techniques can use this information to direct their search for
test cases to likely buggy code, thus speeding up the process of detecting
existing bugs. However, often the predictions given by these tools or humans
are imprecise, which can misguide the SBST technique and may deteriorate its
performance. In this paper, we study the impact of imprecision in defect
prediction on the bug detection effectiveness of SBST.
  Our study finds that the recall of the defect predictor, i.e., the
probability of correctly identifying buggy code, has a significant impact on
bug detection effectiveness of SBST with a large effect size. On the other
hand, the effect of precision, a measure for false alarms, is not of meaningful
practical significance as indicated by a very small effect size. In particular,
the SBST technique finds 7.5 less bugs on average (out of 420 bugs) for every
5% decrements of the recall.
  In the context of combining defect prediction and SBST, our recommendation
for practice is to increase the recall of defect predictors at the expense of
precision, while maintaining a precision of at least 75%. To account for the
imprecision of defect predictors, in particular low recall values, SBST
techniques should be designed to search for test cases that also cover the
predicted non-buggy parts of the program, while prioritising the parts that
have been predicted as buggy.

arisen increasing research interests in the community recently. A qualified
open-world object detector can not only identify objects of known categories,
but also discover unknown objects, and incrementally learn to categorize them

Topology. During the life-long learning of an open-world object detector, all
object instances from the same category are assigned to their corresponding
pre-defined node in the semantic topology, including the `unknown' category.
This constraint builds up discriminative feature representations and consistent
relationships among objects, thus enabling the detector to distinguish unknown
objects out of the known categories, as well as making learned features of
known objects undistorted when learning new categories incrementally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that semantic topology, either randomly-generated or
derived from a well-trained language model, could outperform the current
state-of-the-art open-world object detectors by a large margin, e.g., the
absolute open-set error is reduced from 7832 to 2546, exhibiting the inherent

using k balls of different radii that can be scaled uniformly. The goal is to
minimize the scaling factor. If the number of different radii is unbounded, the
problem does not admit a constant-factor approximation algorithm but it has
been conjectured that such an algorithm exists if the number of radii is
constant. Yet, this is known only for the case of two radii. Our first
contribution is a simple black box reduction which shows that if one can handle
the variant of t-1 radii with outliers, then one can also handle t radii.
Together with an algorithm by Chakrabarty and Negahbani for two radii with
outliers, this immediately implies a constant-factor approximation algorithm
for three radii, thus making further progress on the conjecture. Furthermore,
using algorithms for the k-center with outliers problem, that is the one radii
with outliers case, we also get a simple algorithm for two radii.
  The algorithm by Chakrabarty and Negahbani uses a top-down approach, starting
with the larger radius and then proceeding to the smaller one. Our reduction,
on the other hand, looks only at the smallest radius and eliminates it, which
suggests that a bottom-up approach is promising. In this spirit, we devise a
modification of the Chakrabarty and Negahbani algorithm which runs in a
bottom-up fashion, and in this way we recover their result with the advantage

most sensitive data to date to study the gravitational-wave Universe. As part
of a global network, they have just completed their third observing run in
which they observed many tens of signals from merging compact binary systems.
It has long been known that a limiting factor in identifying transient
gravitational-wave signals is the presence of transient non-Gaussian noise,
which reduce the ability of astrophysical searches to detect signals
confidently. Significant efforts are taken to identify and mitigate this noise
at the source, but its presence persists, leading to the need for software
solutions. Taking a set of transient noise artefacts categorised by the
GravitySpy software during the O3a observing era, we produce parameterised
population models of the noise projected into the space of astrophysical model
parameters of merging binary systems. We compare the inferred population
properties of transient noise artefacts with observed astrophysical systems
from the GWTC2.1 catalogue. We find that while the population of astrophysical
systems tend to have near equal masses and moderate spins, transient noise
artefacts are typically characterised by extreme mass ratios and large spins.
This work provides a new method to calculate the consistency of an observed
candidate with a given class of noise artefacts. This approach could be used in
assessing the consistency of candidates found by astrophysical searches (i.e.
determining if they are consistent with a known glitch class). Furthermore, the
approach could be incorporated into astrophysical searches directly,
potentially improving the reach of the detectors, though only a detailed study
would verify this.

the standard UCB is done using a proposed distance measure, which we call

playback is applied to simulate the model's response and a comparison between
the DSE of multiple generators is made. Finally, when the faulty generator is
identified, we compute energy functions for the mechanical control loop and for
the excitation control loop. The sign and rate of these energies determine the

geometrical tool for controlling plasmonic resonances. Unlike metallic case,
where the multipolar eigenmodes are independent of each other, we find that the

can lead to substantial binaural unmasking. This effect is decreased for
masking noises with an interaural time difference (ITD). Adding a second noise
with an opposing ITD in most cases further reduces binaural unmasking. Thus
far, modeling of these detection thresholds required both a mechanism for
internal ITD compensation and an increased binaural bandwidth. An alternative
explanation for the reduction is that unmasking is impaired by the lower
interaural coherence in off-frequency regions caused by the second masker
(Marquardt & McAlpine, 2009, JASA pp. EL177 - EL182). Based on this hypothesis,
the current work proposes a quantitative multi-channel model using monaurally

interference mechanism. This mechanism differs from wider filters since it has
no effect when the masker coherence is constant across frequency bands.
Combined with a monaural energy discrimination pathway, the model predicts the
differences between a single delayed noise and two opposingly delayed noises,

impeding legitimate users, the use of reversible adversarial attack techniques
is increasing. The original image can be recovered from its reversible
adversarial examples. However, existing reversible adversarial attack methods
are designed for traditional imperceptible adversarial perturbations and ignore
the local visible adversarial perturbation. In this paper, we propose a new
method for generating reversible adversarial examples based on local visible
adversarial perturbation. The information needed for image recovery is embedded
into the area beyond the adversarial patch by the reversible data hiding
technique. To reduce image distortion, lossless compression and the B-R-G
(bluered-green) embedding principle are adopted. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet datasets show that the proposed method can restore the original images
error-free while ensuring good attack performance.

security even with unknown devices. In practice, however, the realization of
device-independent QKD is technically challenging because of its low noise
tolerance. In photonic setup, due to the limited detection efficiency, a large
amount of the data generates from no-detection events which contain little
correlations but contribute high errors. Here we propose the device-independent
QKD protocol with random post selection, where the secret keys are extracted
only from the post-selected subset of outcomes. This could not open the
detection loophole as long as the entropy of the post-selected subset is
evaluated from the information of the entire set of data, including both
detection and no-detection events. This post selection has the advantage to
significantly reduce the error events, thus relaxing the threshold of required
detection efficiency. In the model of collective attacks, our protocol can
tolerate detector efficiency as low as 68.5%, which goes beyond standard
security proofs. The results make a concrete step for the implementation of
device-independent QKD in practice.

we solve an open question formulated in the literature: can we use the
structural properties of median graphs to break this global quadratic barrier?
  We propose the first combinatiorial algorithm computing exactly all
eccentricities of a median graph in truly subquadratic time. Median graphs
constitute the family of graphs which is the most studied in metric graph
theory because their structure represents many other discrete and geometric
concepts, such as CAT(0) cube complexes. Our result generalizes a recent one,
stating that there is a linear-time algorithm for all eccentricities in median
graphs with bounded dimension $d$, i.e. the dimension of the largest induced
hypercube. This prerequisite on $d$ is not necessarily anymore to determine all
eccentricities in subquadratic time. The execution time of our algorithm is
$O(n^{1.6408}\log^{O(1)} n)$.
  We provide also some satellite outcomes related to this general result. In
particular, restricted to simplex graphs, this algorithm enumerates all
eccentricities with a quasilinear running time. Moreover, an algorithm is
proposed to compute exactly all reach centralities in time
$O(2^{3d}n\log^{O(1)}n)$.

proposed approach is that we leverage the learned dynamics model to encode the
environmental condition as context. This insight allows us to employ contextual
Bayesian optimization, thus accelerating the controller tuning problem when the
environment changes and to transfer knowledge across different cars. The

individuals hop between colonies at a rate that depends on the hierarchical
distance between the colonies. The seed-bank has a layered structure: when
individuals become dormant they acquire a colour that determines the rate at
which they become active again. The latter allows us to model seed-banks whose
wake-up times have a fat tail. We analyse a system of coupled stochastic
differential equations that describes the population in the large-colony-size
limit. For fixed $N\in\mathbb{N}$, the system exhibits a dichotomy between
coexistence and clustering. We identify the range of parameters controlling the
migration and the seed-bank for which clustering prevails. We carry out a
multi-scale renormalisation analysis in the hierarchical mean-field limit

the waveguides depending on the quantum dots' ordering and an external voltage

leading to controllable excitation of SPPs in the space between the electrodes.
Under these conditions, the propagation direction of the excited SPPs is
determined by the geometrical configurations of the gold electrodes providing
the required SPP routing. The investigated system offers new opportunities for
near-field energy transport and concentration, which can be applied to develop

Networks (DNNs) are expected to generalize. However, inputs may deviate from
the training dataset distribution in real deployments. This is a fundamental
issue with using a finite dataset. Even worse, real inputs may change over time
from the expected distribution. Taken together, these issues may lead deployed
DNNs to mis-predict in production.
  In this work, we present a runtime approach that mitigates DNN
mis-predictions caused by the unexpected runtime inputs to the DNN. In contrast
to previous work that considers the structure and parameters of the DNN itself,
our approach treats the DNN as a blackbox and focuses on the inputs to the DNN.
Our approach has two steps. First, it recognizes and distinguishes ""unseen""
semantically-preserving inputs. For this we use a distribution analyzer based
on the distance metric learned by a Siamese network. Second, our approach
transforms those unexpected inputs into inputs from the training set that are
identified as having similar semantics. We call this process input reflection
and formulate it as a search problem over the embedding space on the training
set. This embedding space is learned by a Quadruplet network as an auxiliary
model for the subject model to improve the generalization.
  We implemented a tool called InputReflector based on the above two-step
approach and evaluated it with experiments on three DNN models trained on
CIFAR-10, MNIST, and FMINST image datasets. The results show that
InputReflector can effectively distinguish inputs that retain semantics of the

discovery, a class of algorithms that learn a set of policies without access to
a reward function. Such algorithms bear a close resemblance to representation
learning algorithms (e.g., contrastive learning) in supervised learning, in
that both are pretraining algorithms that maximize some approximation to a
mutual information objective. While prior work has shown that the set of skills
learned by such methods can accelerate downstream RL tasks, prior work offers
little analysis into whether these skill learning algorithms are optimal, or
even what notion of optimality would be appropriate to apply to them. In this
work, we show that unsupervised skill discovery algorithms based on mutual
information maximization do not learn skills that are optimal for every
possible reward function. However, we show that the distribution over skills
provides an optimal initialization minimizing regret against
adversarially-chosen reward functions, assuming a certain type of adaptation
procedure. Our analysis also provides a geometric perspective on these skill
learning methods.

training data can be used to learn optimal regularization parameters, data
fidelity terms, and regularizers, thereby resulting in superior variational
regularization methods. In particular, we describe methods to learn optimal $p$

We exploit efficient algorithms based on Krylov projection methods for solving
the regularized problems, both at training and validation stages, making these

learned regularization methods perform well even when there is some inexactness

perturbations which, when expressed in terms of gauge-invariant variables,
contain a classical component from scalar metric perturbations and a quantum
component from inflaton field fluctuations. It has long been known that the
effect of cosmological expansion on a quantum field amounts to squeezing. Thus
the entropy of cosmological perturbations can be studied by treating them in
the framework of squeezed quantum systems. Entropy of a free quantum field is a
seemingly simple yet subtle issue. In this paper, as different from previous
treatments, we tackle this issue with a fully developed nonequilibrium quantum
field theory formalism for such systems. We compute the covariance matrix
elements of the parametric quantum field and solve for the evolution of the
density matrix elements and the Wigner functions, and, from them, derive the
von Neumann entropy. We then show explicitly why the entropy for the squeezed
yet closed system is zero, but is proportional to the particle number produced
upon coarse-graining out the correlation between the particle pairs. We also
construct the bridge between our quantum field-theoretic results and those
using probability distribution of classical stochastic fields by earlier
authors. From this we can see the clear advantages of the quantum
field-theoretical approach over the stochastic classical field treatment since
the latter misses out in some important quantum properties, such as
entanglement and coherence, of the quantum field.

template: fit a model to previously observed data, and then use data from that
model for RL or planning. However, models that achieve better training
performance (e.g., lower MSE) are not necessarily better for control: an RL
agent may seek out the small fraction of states where an accurate model makes
mistakes, or it might act in ways that do not expose the errors of an
inaccurate model. As noted in prior work, there is an objective mismatch:
models are useful if they yield good policies, but they are trained to maximize
their accuracy, rather than the performance of the policies that result from
them. In this work, we propose a single objective for jointly training the
model and the policy, such that updates to either component increase a lower
bound on expected return. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lower
bound for model-based RL that holds globally and can be efficiently estimated
in continuous settings; it is the only lower bound that mends the objective
mismatch problem. A version of this bound becomes tight under certain
assumptions. Optimizing this bound resembles a GAN: a classifier distinguishes
between real and fake transitions, the model is updated to produce transitions
that look realistic, and the policy is updated to avoid states where the model
predictions are unrealistic. Numerical simulations demonstrate that optimizing
this bound yields reward maximizing policies and yields dynamics that (perhaps
surprisingly) can aid in exploration. We also show that a deep RL algorithm

Intensive theoretically and experimental efforts have been devoted to try to
understand the physics in this materials. In this paper the temperature
dependent magneto-transport properties of ZrTe5 thin flakes are investigated. A
characteristic temperature T* is observed in the temperature dependence of
three different types of magnetoresistance simultaneously, which are the
saturated Hall anomaly, the chiral anomaly and the longitudinal
magnetoresistance. Furthermore, the value of T* decreases monotonically from
200K to 160K with increasing thickness of the ZrTe5 thin flakes from 42nm to
89nm. Temperature induced topological phase transitions are attributed to the
cause of such anomaly in the three types of magnetoresistance at T*. Our
findings provide a multi-parameter indicator for the emergence of topological
phase transition in ZrTe5 and could be extended to the study of other
topological materials. The temperature dependence of the three types of
magnetoresistance also shed light on the role of anomalous Hall Effect in the
transport properties of ZrTe5.

who aims at designing a menu of contracts. This is an extension of the
unit-demand envy-free pricing problem: customers aim to choose a contract
maximizing their utility based on a reservation bill and multiple price
coefficients (attributes). A basic approach supposes that the customers have
deterministic utilities; then, the response of each customer is highly
sensitive to price since it concentrates on the best offer. A second classical
approach is to consider logit model to add a probabilistic behavior in the
customers' choices. To circumvent the intrinsic instability of the former and
the resolution difficulties of the latter, we introduce a quadratically
regularized model of customer's response, which leads to a quadratic program
under complementarity constraints (QPCC). This allows to robustify the
deterministic model, while keeping a strong geometrical structure. In
particular, we show that the customer's response is governed by a polyhedral
complex, in which every polyhedral cell determines a set of contracts which is
effectively chosen. Moreover, the deterministic model is recovered as a limit
case of the regularized one. We exploit these geometrical properties to develop
a pivoting heuristic, which we compare with implicit or non-linear methods from
bilevel programming, showing the effectiveness of the approach. Throughout the
paper, the electricity retailer problem is our guideline, and we present a
numerical study on this application case.

devices, there is a growing trend towards distributing the power of deep
learning (DL) across edge devices rather than centralizing it in the cloud.
This development enables better privacy preservation, real-time responses, and
user-specific models. To deploy deep and complex models to edge devices with
limited resources, model partitioning of deep neural networks (DNN) model is
necessary, and has been widely studied. However, most of the existing
literature only considers distributing the inference model while still relying
centralized cloud infrastructure to generate this model through training. In
this paper, we propose FTPipeHD, a novel DNN training framework that trains DNN
models across distributed heterogeneous devices with fault tolerance mechanism.
To accelerate the training with time-varying computing power of each device, we
optimize the partition points dynamically according to real-time computing
capacities. We also propose a novel weight redistribution approach that
replicates the weights to both the neighboring nodes and the central node
periodically, which combats the failure of multiple devices during training
while incurring limited communication cost. Our numerical results demonstrate
that FTPipeHD is 6.8x faster in training than the state of the art method when
the computing capacity of the best device is 10x greater than the worst one. It
is also shown that the proposed method is able to accelerate the training even

training requires a non-trivial amount of memorization to store word spellings,
various linguistic idiosyncrasies and common knowledge. However, little is
known about what affects the memorization behavior of NLP models, as the field
tends to focus on the equally important question of generalization. In this
work, we demonstrate that the size of the subword vocabulary learned by
Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) greatly affects both ability and tendency of standard
Transformer models to memorize training data, even when we control for the
number of learned parameters. We find that with a large subword vocabulary
size, Transformer models fit random mappings more easily and are more
vulnerable to membership inference attacks. Similarly, given a prompt,
Transformer-based language models with large subword vocabularies reproduce the
training data more often. We conjecture this effect is caused by reduction in
the sequences' length that happens as the BPE vocabulary grows. Our findings
can allow a more informed choice of hyper-parameters, that is better tailored

is becoming increasingly important in real-world applications. In multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) settings, policy optimisation with safety
awareness is particularly challenging because each individual agent has to not
only meet its own safety constraints, but also consider those of others so that
their joint behaviour can be guaranteed safe. Despite its importance, the
problem of safe multi-agent learning has not been rigorously studied; very few
solutions have been proposed, nor a sharable testing environment or benchmarks.
To fill these gaps, in this work, we formulate the safe MARL problem as a
constrained Markov game and solve it with policy optimisation methods. Our
solutions -- Multi-Agent Constrained Policy Optimisation (MACPO) and
MAPPO-Lagrangian -- leverage the theories from both constrained policy
optimisation and multi-agent trust region learning. Crucially, our methods
enjoy theoretical guarantees of both monotonic improvement in reward and
satisfaction of safety constraints at every iteration. To examine the
effectiveness of our methods, we develop the benchmark suite of Safe
Multi-Agent MuJoCo that involves a variety of MARL baselines. Experimental
results justify that MACPO/MAPPO-Lagrangian can consistently satisfy safety

architectures have been proposed challenging the status quo. The Vision
Transformer (ViT) relies solely on attention modules, while the MLP-Mixer
architecture substitutes the self-attention modules with Multi-Layer

be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, causing serious concerns for
security-sensitive applications. Thus, it is critical for the community to know
whether the newly proposed ViT and MLP-Mixer are also vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. To this end, we empirically evaluate their adversarial robustness
under several adversarial attack setups and benchmark them against the widely
used CNNs. Overall, we find that the two architectures, especially ViT, are
more robust than their CNN models. Using a toy example, we also provide
empirical evidence that the lower adversarial robustness of CNNs can be
partially attributed to their shift-invariant property. Our frequency analysis
suggests that the most robust ViT architectures tend to rely more on
low-frequency features compared with CNNs. Additionally, we have an intriguing
finding that MLP-Mixer is extremely vulnerable to universal adversarial

durations $t > T$, while for $t < T$ it exhibits exponential-like decays. This
result holds irrespective of the expected degree distribution, as long as it
has a finite $T^{\text{th}}$ moment. Otherwise, the contact distribution
depends on the expected degree distribution and we show that if the latter is a
power law with exponent $\gamma \in (2, T+1]$, then the former decays as a
power law with exponent $\gamma+1 > 3$. On the other hand, the intercontact
distribution exhibits power-law decays with exponent $2-T \in (0, 1)$ for $T
\in (1,2)$, while for $T > 2$ it displays linear decays with a slope that
depends on the observation interval. This result holds irrespective of the
expected degree distribution as long as it has a finite $T^{\text{th}}$ moment
if $T \in (1,2)$, or a finite second moment if $T > 2$. Otherwise, the
intercontact distribution depends on the expected degree distribution and if
the latter is a power law with exponent $\gamma \in (2, 3)$, then the former
decays as a power law with exponent $3-\gamma \in (0,1)$. Thus, hot random
hyperbolic graphs can give rise to contact and intercontact distributions that
both decay as power laws. These power laws however are unrealistic for the case
of the intercontact distribution, as their exponent is always less than one.
These results mean that hot random hyperbolic graphs are not adequate for
modeling real temporal networks, in stark contrast to cold random hyperbolic
graphs ($T < 1$). Since the configuration model emerges at $T \to \infty$,
these results also suggest that this is not an adequate null temporal network
model.

existing tools that identify localized excitations in stable systems, and apply
them to these unstable systems with non-positive definite Hessians, quantifying
the evolution of such excitations during avalanches. We find that bursts of

number of classes of algebraic structures, such as small categories,
n-categories, strict and weak omega-categories, planar coloured operads and
opetopic sets. We then show that every locally finitely presentable category is
the category of models of some dependently typed algebraic theory. Thus, with
respect to their Set-models, these theories are just as expressive as GATs,
essentially algebraic theories and finite limit sketches. However, dependently
typed algebraic theories admit a good definition of homotopy-models in spaces,
via a left Bousfield localisation of a global model structure on simplicial
presheaves. Some cases, such as certain ""idempotent opetopic theories"", have a
rigidification theorem relating homotopy-models and (strict) simplicial models.

particularly interesting strongly interacting flat band because inter-electron
interactions are predicted to induce a rich variety of broken-symmetry states
with distinct topological and lattice-scale orders. Evidence for these stems
mostly from indirect transport experiments that suggest that broken-symmetry
states are tunable by boosting the Zeeman energy or by dielectric screening of
the Coulomb interaction. However, confirming the existence of these ground

image three distinct broken-symmetry phases in graphene using scanning

the Coulomb interaction by a low or high dielectric constant environment, and
with a magnetic field. In the unscreened case, we unveil a Kekul\'e bond order,
consistent with observations of an insulating state undergoing a magnetic-field
driven Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Under dielectric screening, a
sublattice-unpolarized ground state emerges at low magnetic fields, and
transits to a charge-density-wave order with partial sublattice polarization at
higher magnetic fields. The Kekul\'e and charge-density-wave orders furthermore
coexist with additional, secondary lattice-scale orders that enrich the phase

terms used in variational imaging problems, together with detailed optimisation
processes of these problems. We begin by studying smooth problems and partially
non-smooth problems in the form of Tikhonov denoising and Total Variation (TV)
denoising, respectively.
  For Tikhonov denoising, we study an accelerated gradient method with adaptive
restart, which shows a very rapid convergence rate. However, it is not
straightforward to apply this fast algorithm to TV denoising, due to the
non-smoothness of its built-in regularisation. To tackle this issue, we propose
to utilise duality to convert such a non-smooth problem into a smooth one so
that the accelerated gradient method with restart applies naturally.
  However, we notice that both Tikhonov and TV regularisations have drawbacks,
in the form of blurred image edges and staircase artefacts, respectively. To
overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel adaption to Total Generalised
Variation (TGV) regularisation called Total Smooth Variation (TSV), which
retains edges and meanwhile does not produce results which contain staircase
artefacts. To optimise TSV effectively, we then propose the Accelerated
Proximal Gradient Algorithm (APGA) which also utilises adaptive restart
techniques. Compared to existing state-of-the-art regularisations (e.g. TV),
TSV is shown to obtain more effective results on denoising problems as well as
advanced imaging applications such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
reconstruction and optical flow. TSV removes the staircase artefacts observed
when using TV regularisation, but has the added advantage over TGV that it can
be efficiently optimised using gradient based methods with Nesterov
acceleration and adaptive restart. Code is available at

applications but is also challenging. For instance, rearranging products in a

limited free space. This is harder than tabletop rearrangement where objects
are easily accessible with top-down grasps, which simplifies robot-object
interactions. This work focuses on problems where such interactions are
critical for completing tasks. It proposes a new efficient and complete solver
under general constraints for monotone instances, which can be solved by moving
each object at most once. The monotone solver reasons about robot-object
constraints and uses them to effectively prune the search space. The new
monotone solver is integrated with a global planner to solve non-monotone
instances with high-quality solutions fast. Furthermore, this work contributes
an effective pre-processing tool to significantly speed up online motion
planning queries for rearrangement in confined spaces. Experiments further
demonstrate that the proposed monotone solver, equipped with the pre-processing

Saturn with Tisserand parameter $T_J\sim$3 are transferred onto orbits with
perihelia $q<4$au within the next 1000 years with notably high efficiency. Our

in the small-scale structure of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) absorption in
quasar spectra. The 1D flux power spectrum measures the average small-scale
structure along quasar sightlines. At high redshifts, where the opacity is
large, averaging mixes high signal-to-noise ratio transmission spikes with
noisy absorption troughs. Wavelet amplitudes are an alternate statistic that
maintains spatial information while quantifying fluctuations at the same
spatial frequencies as the power spectrum, giving them the potential to more
sensitively measure the small-scale structure. Previous Ly$\alpha$ forest
studies using wavelet amplitude probability density functions (PDFs) used
limited spatial frequencies and neglected strong correlations between PDF bins
and across wavelets scales, resulting in sub-optimal and unreliable parameter
inference. Here we present a novel method for performing statistical inference
using wavelet amplitude PDFs that spans the full range of spatial frequencies
probed by the power spectrum and that fully accounts for these correlations. We
applied this procedure to realistic mock data drawn from a simple thermal model
parameterized by the temperature at mean density, $T_0$, and find that wavelets
deliver 1$\sigma$ constraints on $T_0$ that are on average 7% more sensitive at
$z=5$ (12% at $z=6$) than those from the power spectrum. We consider the
possibility of combing wavelet PDFs with the power, but find that this does not
lead to improved sensitivity.

  1. The MSA problem admits an $\mathsf{FPT}$ (\emph{fixed-parameter

Active Galactic Nuclei and are thought to be responsible for the phenomenon of

without obvious major merger signatures. Minor mergers are frequently proposed
to explain the existence of these Active Galactic Nuclei. In this paper, we
perform nine high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of minor galaxy mergers
and investigate whether nuclear activities can be efficiently triggered by
minor mergers, by setting various properties for the progenitor galaxies of
those mergers. We find that minor galaxy merger scan activate the massive black
hole in the primary galaxy with an Eddington ratio of $f_{\rm Edd}>0.01$ and
$>0.05$ (or a bolometric luminosity $>10^{43}$ and $>10^{44}\mathrm{erg\,

nucleus separation, the nucleus is more active as the two nuclei approach to
each other. Dual Active Galactic Nuclei systems can still possibly form by
minor mergers of galaxies, the time period for dual Active Galactic Nuclei is
only $\sim 0.011$ Gyr and $\sim 0.017$ Gyr with Eddington ratio of $f_{\rm

human subjects, ranging from novice to experienced developers. The experience
of these individuals is a key context factor that should be properly
characterized for supporting the design of empirical studies and interpreting
their results. However, the criteria adopted for characterizing the experience
of subjects do not follow a standard and are frequently limited. Goal: Our
research aims at establishing an optimized and comprehensive scheme to
characterize the subjects' experience for studies in software engineering.
Method: Based on previous work, we defined the first version of this scheme,
composed of three experience attributes, including time, number of projects,
and self-perception. In the last years, we applied the characterization scheme
over four empirical studies, reaching the characterization of 79 subjects in
three different skills. Results: We found that the attributes from our scheme
are positively but moderately correlated. This finding suggests these
attributes play a complementary role in characterizing the subjects'
experience. Besides, we found that study subjects tend to enumerate the
technical diversity of their background when summarizing their professional
experience. Conclusion: The scheme proposed represents a feasible alternative
for characterizing subjects of empirical studies in the field. However, we
intend to conduct additional investigations with developers to evolve it.

  We study the 2XOR-Cascade construction of Ga\v{z}i and Tessaro

n-bit block cipher with 5n/2 bits of security out of an n-bit block cipher with
2n bits of key, with a security proof in the ideal model. We show that the
offline-Simon algorithm of Bonnetain et al. (ASIACRYPT~2019) can be extended
to, in particular, attack this construction in quantum time \~O($2^n$),
providing a 2.5 quantum speedup over the best classical attack.
  Regarding post-quantum security of symmetric ciphers, it is commonly assumed
that doubling the key sizes is a sufficient precaution. This is because
Grover's quantum search algorithm, and its derivatives, can only reach a
quadratic speedup at most. Our attack shows that the structure of some
symmetric constructions can be exploited to overcome this limit. In particular,
the 2XOR-Cascade cannot be used to generically strengthen block ciphers against
quantum adversaries, as it would offer only the same security as the block

recent times, with improved naturalness and intelligibility. However, the
end-to-end models, which primarily depend on the attention-based alignment, do
not offer an explicit provision to modify/incorporate the desired prosody while
synthesizing the signal. Moreover, the state-of-the-art end-to-end systems use
autoregressive models for synthesis, making the prediction sequential. Hence,
the inference time and the computational complexity are quite high. This paper
proposes Prosody-TTS, an end-to-end speech synthesis model that combines the
advantages of statistical parametric models and end-to-end neural network
models. It also has a provision to modify or incorporate the desired prosody by
controlling the fundamental frequency (f0) and the phone duration. Generating
speech samples with appropriate prosody and rhythm helps in improving the
naturalness of the synthesized speech. We explicitly model the duration of the
phoneme and the f0 to have control over them during the synthesis. The model is
trained in an end-to-end fashion to directly generate the speech waveform from
the input text, which in turn depends on the auxiliary subtasks of predicting
the phoneme duration, f0, and mel spectrogram. Experiments on the Telugu
language data of the IndicTTS database show that the proposed Prosody-TTS model
achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean opinion score of 4.08, with a
very low inference time.

fabric, to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Masks are essentially
air filters worn on the face, that should filter out as many of the dangerous
particles as possible. Here the dangerous particles are the droplets containing
virus that are exhaled by an infected person. Woven fabric is unlike the
material used in standard air filters. Woven fabric consists of fibres twisted
together into yarns that are then woven into fabric. There are therefore two
lengthscales: the diameters of: (i) the fibre and (ii) the yarn. Standard air
filters have only (i). To understand how woven fabrics filter, we have used
confocal microscopy to take three dimensional images of woven fabric. We then
used the image to perform Lattice Boltzmann simulations of the air flow through
fabric. With this flow field we calculated the filtration efficiency for
particles a micrometre and larger in diameter. In agreement with experimental
measurements by others, we find that for particles in this size range,
filtration efficiency is low. For particles with a diameter of 1.5 micrometres
our estimated efficiency is in the range 2.5 to 10%. The low efficiency is due
to most of the air flow being channelled through relatively large (tens of
micrometres across) inter-yarn pores. So we conclude that fabric is expected to
filter poorly due to the hierarchical structure of woven fabrics.

equipped with a vertically placed uniform linear array (ULA), which sends
combined information and sensing signals to communicate with multiple users and
sense potential targets at interested areas on the ground simultaneously. Our
objective is to jointly design the UAV maneuver with the transmit beamforming
for optimizing the communication performance while ensuring the sensing
requirements. First, we consider the quasi-stationary UAV scenario, in which
the UAV is deployed at an optimizable location over the whole ISAC mission
period. In this case, we jointly optimize the UAV deployment location, as well
as the transmit information and sensing beamforming to maximize the weighted
sum-rate throughput, subject to the sensing beampattern gain requirements and
transmit power constraint. Although the above problem is non-convex, we find a
high-quality solution by using the techniques of SCA and SDR, together with a
2D location search. Next, we consider the fully mobile UAV scenario, in which
the UAV can fly over different locations during the ISAC mission period. In
this case, we optimize the UAV flight trajectory, jointly with the transmit
beamforming over time, to maximize the average weighted sum-rate throughput,
subject to the sensing beampattern gain requirements and transmit power
constraints as well as practical flight constraints. While the joint UAV
trajectory and beamforming problem is more challenging to solve, we propose an
efficient algorithm by adopting the alternating optimization together with SCA.
Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the superiority of our
proposed designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.

stellar population properties in massive early-type galaxies have been shown to
correlate with intrinsic galaxy properties like the galaxy's central velocity
dispersion, suggesting that stars formed in an initial collapse of gas (z~2).
However, stellar populations change as a function of galaxy radius, and it is
not clear how local gradients of individual galaxies are influenced by global
galaxy properties and galaxy environment. In this paper, we study the stellar
populations of eight early-type galaxies as a function of radius. We use
optical spectroscopy (~4000-8600 \r{A}) and full-spectral fitting to measure
stellar population age, metallicity, IMF slope, and nine elemental abundances
(O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, C, N, Na, Fe) out to 1 R_e for each galaxy individually. We
find a wide range of properties, with ages ranging from 3-13 Gyr. Some galaxies
have a radially constant, Salpeter-like IMF, and other galaxies have a
super-Salpeter IMF in the center, decreasing to a sub-Salpeter IMF at ~0.5 R_e.
We find a global correlation of the central [Z/H] to the central IMF and the
radial gradient of the IMF for the eight galaxies, but local correlations of
the IMF slope to other stellar population parameters hold only for subsets of
the galaxies in our sample. Some elemental abundances also correlate locally
with each other within a galaxy, suggesting a common production channel. Those
local correlations appear only in subsets of our galaxies indicating variations
of the stellar content among different galaxies.

exponentially smoothed sum (SGD with momentum) or squared sum (Adam) of past

plain stochastic gradient descent but uses memory that might otherwise be
allocated to model parameters, thereby limiting the maximum size of models
trained in practice. In this paper, we develop the first optimizers that use
8-bit statistics while maintaining the performance levels of using 32-bit
optimizer states. To overcome the resulting computational, quantization, and
stability challenges, we develop block-wise dynamic quantization. Block-wise
quantization divides input tensors into smaller blocks that are independently
quantized. Each block is processed in parallel across cores, yielding faster
optimization and high precision quantization. To maintain stability and
performance, we combine block-wise quantization with two additional changes:
(1) dynamic quantization, a form of non-linear optimization that is precise for
both large and small magnitude values, and (2) a stable embedding layer to
reduce gradient variance that comes from the highly non-uniform distribution of
input tokens in language models. As a result, our 8-bit optimizers maintain
32-bit performance with a small fraction of the memory footprint on a range of

SNNs for neuromorphic computing are regarded as potentially more rapid and
efficient than ANNs when dealing with temporal input. On the other hand, ANNs
are simpler to train, and usually achieve superior performance. Here we show
that temporal coding such as rank coding (RC) inspired by SNNs can also be
applied to conventional ANNs such as LSTMs, and leads to computational savings
and speedups. In our RC for ANNs, we apply backpropagation through time using
the standard real-valued activations, but only from a strategically early time
step of each sequential input example, decided by a threshold-crossing event.
Learning then incorporates naturally also _when_ to produce an output, without
other changes to the model or the algorithm. Both the forward and the backward
training pass can be significantly shortened by skipping the remaining input
sequence after that first event. RC-training also significantly reduces
time-to-insight during inference, with a minimal decrease in accuracy. The
desired speed-accuracy trade-off is tunable by varying the threshold or a
regularization parameter that rewards output entropy. We demonstrate these in
two toy problems of sequence classification, and in a temporally-encoded MNIST
dataset where our RC model achieves 99.19% accuracy after the first input
time-step, outperforming the state of the art in temporal coding with SNNs, as

vortices hosting a single flux quantum. In contrast, the ac response of type I

reliable sequence reconstruction. Motivated by DNA-based storage, we study the
coded version of this problem;i.e., the scenario where the DNA molecule being

characterization of the capacity of the resulting shotgun sequencing channel as
a function of the read length and coverage depth. In particular, our results
imply that, while in the uncoded case, $O(n)$ reads of length greater than
$2\log{n}$ are needed for reliable reconstruction of a length-$n$ binary

returns at different moments are independent of each other and obey the same
kind of GD, whose dynamic parameters are driven by DCS. By predicting the
motion law of the time-varying parameters, the conditional distribution of
intraday returns is determined; then, the bootstrap method is used to simulate
daily returns. An empirical analysis using data from the Chinese stock market

superior to traditional benchmark models, such as RGARCH, in the prediction of

represent promising materials, with large surface areas and dense ensembles of

NV0 centers. Here, we study the fluorescence properties and optically detected
magnetic resonance (ODMR) of NV- centers as a function of laser power in
strongly fluorescent bulk diamond and in nanodiamonds obtained by nanomilling
the native material. In bulk diamond, we find that increasing laser power
increases ODMR contrast, consistent with a power-dependent increase in
spin-polarization. Surprisingly, in nanodiamonds we observe a non-monotonic
behavior, with a decrease in ODMR contrast at higher laser power that can be
ascribed to more efficient NV- -> NV0 photoconversion in nanodiamonds compared
to bulk diamond, resulting in depletion of the NV- pool. We also studied this
phenomenon in cell cultures following internalization of NDs in macrophages.
Our findings show that surface effects in nanodiamonds substantially affect the

model. Such approaches often derive the training signal from the mean-squared
error (MSE) between the generated frame and the ground truth, which can lead to
sub-optimal training, especially when the predictive uncertainty is high.
Towards this end, we introduce Neural Uncertainty Quantifier (NUQ) - a
stochastic quantification of the model's predictive uncertainty, and use it to
weigh the MSE loss. We propose a hierarchical, variational framework to derive
NUQ in a principled manner using a deep, Bayesian graphical model. Our
experiments on four benchmark stochastic video prediction datasets show that
our proposed framework trains more effectively compared to the state-of-the-art

better video generation quality and diversity against several evaluation

since it has the great potential to circumvent the need for acquiring high-cost
medical scans and a time-consuming preprocessing pipeline of neuroimaging data.
However, existing deep learning frameworks are solely designed to predict
high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) one, which limits their
generalization ability to brain graphs (i.e., connectomes). A small body of
works has focused on superresolving brain graphs where the goal is to predict a
HR graph from a single LR graph. Although promising, existing works mainly
focus on superresolving graphs belonging to the same domain (e.g., functional),
overlooking the domain fracture existing between multimodal brain data
distributions (e.g., morphological and structural). To this aim, we propose a
novel inter-domain adaptation framework namely, Learn to SuperResolve Brain
Graphs with Knowledge Distillation Network (L2S-KDnet), which adopts a
teacher-student paradigm to superresolve brain graphs. Our teacher network is a
graph encoder-decoder that firstly learns the LR brain graph embeddings, and
secondly learns how to align the resulting latent representations to the HR
ground truth data distribution using an adversarial regularization. Ultimately,
it decodes the HR graphs from the aligned embeddings. Next, our student network
learns the knowledge of the aligned brain graphs as well as the topological
structure of the predicted HR graphs transferred from the teacher. We further
leverage the decoder of the teacher to optimize the student network. L2S-KDnet
presents the first TS architecture tailored for brain graph super-resolution
synthesis that is based on inter-domain alignment. Our experimental results
demonstrate substantial performance gains over benchmark methods.

Specifically, a CBT is viewed as an integral representation of a set of highly

distance to all graphs in the population) and discriminativeness (i.e.,
distinguishes the healthy from the disordered population) criteria. So far,
existing works have been limited to only integrating and fusing a population of
brain multigraphs acquired at a single timepoint. In this paper, we
unprecedentedly tackle the question: Given a baseline multigraph population,
can we learn how to integrate and forecast its CBT representations at follow-up
timepoints? Addressing such question is of paramount in predicting common
alternations across healthy and disordered populations. To fill this gap, we
propose Recurrent Multigraph Integrator Network (ReMI-Net), the first graph
recurrent neural network which infers the baseline CBT of an input population
t1 and predicts its longitudinal evolution over time (ti > t1). Our ReMI-Net is
composed of recurrent neural blocks with graph convolutional layers using a
cross-node message passing to first learn hidden-states embeddings of each CBT
node (i.e., brain region of interest) and then predict its evolution at the
consecutive timepoint. Moreover, we design a novel time-dependent loss to
regularize the CBT evolution trajectory over time and further introduce a
cyclic recursion and learnable normalization layer to generate well-centered
CBTs from time-dependent hidden-state embeddings. Finally, we derive the CBT

the mismatch between target batch statistics and source parameters. To this

the domain shift and preserving the discriminative structures. Based on

helps doctors make precise clinical decisions. Although promising, existing
multimodal brain graph synthesis frameworks have several limitations. First,
they mainly tackle only one problem (intra- or inter-modality), limiting their
generalizability to synthesizing inter- and intra-modality simultaneously.
Second, while few techniques work on super-resolving low-resolution brain
graphs within a single modality (i.e., intra), inter-modality graph
super-resolution remains unexplored though this would avoid the need for costly
data collection and processing. More importantly, both target and source
domains might have different distributions, which causes a domain fracture
between them. To fill these gaps, we propose a multi-resolution
StairwayGraphNet (SG-Net) framework to jointly infer a target graph modality
based on a given modality and super-resolve brain graphs in both inter and
intra domains. Our SG-Net is grounded in three main contributions: (i)
predicting a target graph from a source one based on a novel graph generative
adversarial network in both inter (e.g., morphological-functional) and intra
(e.g., functional-functional) domains, (ii) generating high-resolution brain
graphs without resorting to the time consuming and expensive MRI processing
steps, and (iii) enforcing the source distribution to match that of the ground
truth graphs using an inter-modality aligner to relax the loss function to
optimize. Moreover, we design a new Ground Truth-Preserving loss function to
guide both generators in learning the topological structure of ground truth
brain graphs more accurately. Our comprehensive experiments on predicting
target brain graphs from source graphs using a multi-resolution stairway showed
the outperformance of our method in comparison with its variants and

understanding parametric tournament representations. Our first contribution is
to structurally characterize the class of tournaments that arise out of $d$
dimensional representations. We do this by showing that these tournament
classes have forbidden configurations which must necessarily be union of flip
classes, a novel way to partition the set of all tournaments. We further
characterise rank $2$ tournaments completely by showing that the associated
forbidden flip class contains just $2$ tournaments. Specifically, we show that
the rank $2$ tournaments are equivalent to locally-transitive tournaments. This
insight allows us to show that the minimum feedback arc set problem on this

general rank $d$ tournament class, we show that the flip class associated with
a coned-doubly regular tournament of size $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$ must be a

including the largest Lyapunov exponent, the Sugihara-May correlation, and the
correlation dimension consistently captures an intrinsic dimension of the
hurricane chaotic attractor in the range of 4-5. In addition, the error
doubling time is roughly 1-5 hours, which accords with the decay time obtained
from the Sugihara-May correlation. The confirmation of hurricane chaotic
intensity as found in this study suggests a relatively short limit for
intensity predictability of $\sim$18-24 hours after reaching the maximum
intensity stage. So long as the traditional metrics for hurricane intensity
such as the maximum surface wind or the minimum central pressure is used for
intensity forecast, our results support that hurricane intensity forecast
errors will not be reduced indefinitely in any modelling systems, even in the
absence of all model and observational errors. As such, the future improvement
of hurricane intensity forecast should be based on different intensity metric
beyond the absolute intensity errors as in the current practice of intensity

that early diagnosis of brain disorders, such as mild cognitive impairment

time-dependent brain disorder diagnosis by regarding the brain as instead a
large interconnected graph characterizing the interconnectivity scheme between
several brain regions. We term our proposed method Recurrent Brain Graph Mapper
(RBGM), a novel efficient edge-based recurrent graph neural network that
predicts the time-dependent evaluation trajectory of a brain graph from a
single baseline. Our RBGM contains a set of recurrent neural network-inspired
mappers for each time point, where each mapper aims to project the ground-truth
brain graph onto its next time point. We leverage the teacher forcing method to
boost training and improve the evolved brain graph quality. To maintain the
topological consistency between the predicted brain graphs and their
corresponding ground-truth brain graphs at each time point, we further
integrate a topological loss. We also use l1 loss to capture time-dependency
and minimize the distance between the brain graph at consecutive time points
for regularization. Benchmarks against several variants of RBGM and
state-of-the-art methods prove that we can achieve the same accuracy in

  Application to Brain Connectivity Classification and Evolution Prediction",,,,,"cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Few-shot learning presents a challenging paradigm for training discriminative
models on a few training samples representing the target classes to
discriminate. However, classification methods based on deep learning are
ill-suited for such learning as they need large amounts of training data --let
alone one-shot learning. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been
introduced to the field of network neuroscience, where the brain connectivity
is encoded in a graph. However, with scarce neuroimaging datasets particularly
for rare diseases and low-resource clinical facilities, such data-devouring
architectures might fail in learning the target task. In this paper, we take a
very different approach in training GNNs, where we aim to learn with one sample
and achieve the best performance --a formidable challenge to tackle.
Specifically, we present the first one-shot paradigm where a GNN is trained on
a single population-driven template --namely a connectional brain template
(CBT). A CBT is a compact representation of a population of brain graphs
capturing the unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. It is
analogous to brain image atlases for neuroimaging datasets. Using a
one-representative CBT as a training sample, we alleviate the training load of
GNN models while boosting their performance across a variety of classification
and regression tasks. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperformed
benchmark one-shot learning methods with downstream classification and
time-dependent brain graph data forecasting tasks while competing with the
train-on-all conventional training strategy. Our source code can be found at

with a simple integrated feed. Power from a localized line source is
distributed throughout the arbitrarily large antenna aperture with the help of
a passive and lossless electromagnetic metagrating (MG). With appropriately
designed meta-wire loading, the omnidirectional source field can be efficiently
transformed into directive radiation. To aid the design process, a
2-dimensional volume-surface integral equation framework which accurately
predicts the radiation pattern of the MGA is developed. Through constrained
optimization, the directivity of the MGA in the desired direction is maximized.
In this way, extreme-angle beam steering is demonstrated.

criterion, we have successfully addressed the widely concerned issue of the
previously published mapped weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes
that it is rather difficult to achieve high resolutions on the premise of
removing spurious oscillations for long-run simulations of the hyperbolic
systems. In the present study, we extend the OP criterion to the WENO-Z-type
schemes as the forementioned issue has also been extensively observed
numerically for these schemes. Firstly, we innovatively present the concept of
the generalized mapped WENO schemes by rewriting the Z-type weights in a
uniform formula from the perspective of the mapping relation. Then, we
naturally introduce the OP criterion to improve the WENO-Z-type schemes, and
the resultant schemes are denoted as MOP-GMWENO-X. Finally, extensive numerical
experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the benefits of these new
schemes. We draw the conclusion that, the convergence propoties of the proposed
schemes are equivalent to the corresponding WENO-X schemes. The major benefit
of the new schemes is that they have the capacity to achieve high resolutions
and simultaneously remove spurious oscillations for long simulations. The new
schemes have the additional benefit that they can greatly decrease the
post-shock oscillations on solving 2D Euler problems with strong shock waves.

the Earth can be identified through searches for multiple transients in old
photographic plate material exposed before the launch of first human satellite
in 1957. In order to separate between possible false point-like sources on
photographic plates from real reflections, we present calculations to quantify
the associated probabilities of alignments. We show that in an image with nine
""simultaneous transients"" at least four or five point sources along a line
within a $10 \ast 10$ arcmin$^{2}$ image box are a strong indicator of NTAs,
corresponding to significance levels of $2.5$ to $3.9 \sigma$. This given
methodology can then be applied to set an upper limit to the prevalence of NTAs
with reflective surfaces in geosynchronous orbits.

The task of collecting, extracting, and aligning texts in order to build an
acceptable corpus for doing the translation is very tedious most especially for
low-resource languages. In this paper, we present the efforts made to build a
parallel corpus for Cebuano and Filipino from two different domains: biblical
texts and the web. For the biblical resource, subword unit translation for
verbs and copy-able approach for nouns were applied to correct inconsistencies
in the translation. This correction mechanism was applied as a preprocessing
technique. On the other hand, for Wikipedia being the main web resource,
commonly occurring topic segments were extracted from both the source and the
target languages. These observed topic segments are unique in 4 different
categories. The identification of these topic segments may be used for the
automatic extraction of sentences. A Recurrent Neural Network was used to
implement the translation using OpenNMT sequence modeling tool in TensorFlow.
The two different corpora were then evaluated by using them as two separate
inputs in the neural network. Results have shown a difference in BLEU scores in
both corpora.

few years. This is primarily due to an ever increasing awareness of the
detrimental environmental effects of fossil fuel powered vehicles and
availability of inexpensive Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In order to safely
deploy these LIBs in Electric Vehicles, certain battery states need to be
constantly monitored to ensure safe and healthy operation. The use of Machine
Learning to estimate battery states such as State-of-Charge and State-of-Health
have become an extremely active area of research. However, limited availability
of open-source diverse datasets has stifled the growth of this field, and is a
problem largely ignored in literature. In this work, we propose a novel method
of time-series battery data augmentation using deep neural networks. We
introduce and analyze the method of using two neural networks working together
to alternatively produce synthetic charging and discharging battery profiles.
One model produces battery charging profiles, and another produces battery
discharging profiles. The proposed approach is evaluated using few public
battery datasets to illustrate its effectiveness, and our results show the
efficacy of this approach to solve the challenges of limited battery data. We
also test this approach on dynamic Electric Vehicle drive cycles as well.
