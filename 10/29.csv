science and applications in a broad range of domains. Consequently, the notion
of applying learning methods to a particular problem set has become an
established and valuable modus operandi to advance a particular field. In this
article we argue that such an approach does not straightforwardly extended to
robotics -- or to embodied intelligence more generally: systems which engage in
a purposeful exchange of energy and information with a physical environment. In
particular, the purview of embodied intelligent agents extends significantly
beyond the typical considerations of main-stream machine learning approaches,
which typically (i) do not consider operation under conditions significantly
different from those encountered during training; (ii) do not consider the
often substantial, long-lasting and potentially safety-critical nature of
interactions during learning and deployment; (iii) do not require ready
adaptation to novel tasks while at the same time (iv) effectively and
efficiently curating and extending their models of the world through targeted
and deliberate actions. In reality, therefore, these limitations result in
learning-based systems which suffer from many of the same operational
shortcomings as more traditional, engineering-based approaches when deployed on
a robot outside a well defined, and often narrow operating envelope. Contrary
to viewing embodied intelligence as another application domain for machine
learning, here we argue that it is in fact a key driver for the advancement of
machine learning technology. In this article our goal is to highlight
challenges and opportunities that are specific to embodied intelligence and to
propose research directions which may significantly advance the
state-of-the-art in robot learning.

  Study on Reactive Programming",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Well structured and readable source code is a pre-requisite for maintainable
software and successful collaboration among developers. Static analysis enables
the automated extraction of code complexity and readability metrics which can
be leveraged to highlight potential improvements in code to both attain
software of high quality and reinforce good practices for developers as an
educational tool. This assumes reliable readability metrics which are not
trivial to obtain since code readability is somewhat subjective. Recent
research has resulted in increasingly sophisticated models for predicting
readability as perceived by humans primarily with a procedural and object
oriented focus, while functional and declarative languages and language
extensions advance as they often are said to lead to more concise and readable
code. In this paper, we investigate whether the existing complexity and
readability metrics reflect that wisdom or whether the notion of readability
and its constituents requires overhaul in the light of programming language
changes. We therefore compare traditional object oriented and reactive
programming in terms of code complexity and readability in a case study.
Reactive programming is claimed to increase code quality but few studies have
substantiated these claims empirically. We refactored an object oriented open
source project into a reactive candidate and compare readability with the
original using cyclomatic complexity and two state-of-the-art readability
metrics. More elaborate investigations are required, but our findings suggest
that both cyclomatic complexity and readability decrease significantly at the
same time in the reactive candidate, which seems counter-intuitive. We
exemplify and substantiate why readability metrics may require adjustment to
better suit popular programming styles other than imperative and
object-oriented to better match human expectations.

  Cloud Registration","Accepted by AAAI 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Even though considerable progress has been made in deep learning-based 3D
point cloud processing, how to obtain accurate correspondences for robust
registration remains a major challenge because existing hard assignment methods
cannot deal with outliers naturally. Alternatively, the soft matching-based
methods have been proposed to learn the matching probability rather than hard
assignment. However, in this paper, we prove that these methods have an
inherent ambiguity causing many deceptive correspondences. To address the above
challenges, we propose to learn a partial permutation matching matrix, which
does not assign corresponding points to outliers, and implements hard
assignment to prevent ambiguity. However, this proposal poses two new problems,
i.e., existing hard assignment algorithms can only solve a full rank
permutation matrix rather than a partial permutation matrix, and this desired
matrix is defined in the discrete space, which is non-differentiable. In
response, we design a dedicated soft-to-hard (S2H) matching procedure within
the registration pipeline consisting of two steps: solving the soft matching
matrix (S-step) and projecting this soft matrix to the partial permutation
matrix (H-step). Specifically, we augment the profit matrix before the hard
assignment to solve an augmented permutation matrix, which is cropped to
achieve the final partial permutation matrix. Moreover, to guarantee end-to-end
learning, we supervise the learned partial permutation matrix but propagate the
gradient to the soft matrix instead. Our S2H matching procedure can be easily
integrated with existing registration frameworks, which has been verified in
representative frameworks including DCP, RPMNet, and DGR. Extensive experiments
have validated our method, which creates a new state-of-the-art performance for
robust 3D point cloud registration. The code will be made public.

learning by training models while keeping client data local. Models trained
using FL may still leak private client information through model updates during
training. Differential privacy (DP) may be employed on model updates to provide
privacy guarantees within FL, typically at the cost of degraded performance of
the final trained model. Both non-private FL and DP-FL can be solved using
variants of the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm. In this work, we
consider a heterogeneous DP setup where clients require varying degrees of
privacy guarantees. First, we analyze the optimal solution to the federated
linear regression problem with heterogeneous DP in a Bayesian setup. We find
that unlike the non-private setup, where the optimal solution for homogeneous
data amounts to a single global solution for all clients learned through
FedAvg, the optimal solution for each client in this setup would be a
personalized one even for homogeneous data. We also analyze the privacy-utility
trade-off for this setup, where we characterize the gain obtained from
heterogeneous privacy where some clients opt for less strict privacy
guarantees. We propose a new algorithm for FL with heterogeneous DP, named
FedHDP, which employs personalization and weighted averaging at the server
using the privacy choices of clients, to achieve better performance on clients'
local models. Through numerical experiments, we show that FedHDP provides up to
$9.27\%$ performance gain compared to the baseline DP-FL for the considered
datasets where $5\%$ of clients opt out of DP. Additionally, we show a gap in
the average performance of local models between non-private and private clients

task requirements, networks rely more heavily on either the temporal or

widely invoked to help eject an axisymmetric nebula, after a brief phase of
engulfment of the secondary within the envelope of the Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) star, known as the common envelope (CE). The evolution of the AGB would
thus be interrupted abruptly, its envelope being rapidly ejected to form the
PN, which a priori would be more massive than a PN coming from the same star,
were it single. We aim at testing this hypothesis by investigating the mass of
a sample of 21 post-CE PNe, ~1/5th of the known total population, and comparing
them to a large sample of `regular' (i.e. not known to host close binaries)
PNe. We have gathered data on the ionised and molecular content of our sample
and carried out new molecular observations. We derive the ionised and molecular
masses of the sample by means of a systematic approach, using tabulated,
dereddened H-beta fluxes for finding the ionised mass, and CO 2-1 and 3-2
observations for the molecular mass. There is a general lack of molecular
content in post-CE PNe, with few exceptions. Once we derive the ionised and
molecular masses, we find that post-CE PNe arising from Single-Degenerate (SD)
systems are just as massive, on average, as `regular' PNe, whereas post-CE PNe
arising from Double-Degenerate (DD) systems are considerably more massive, and
show larger linear momenta and kinetic energy than SD systems and `regular'
PNe. Reconstruction of the CE of four objects suggests that the mass of SD
nebulae actually amounts to a very small fraction of the envelope of their
progenitor stars. This leads to the uncomfortable question of where the rest of
the envelope is and why we cannot detect it in the stars' vicinity, thus
raising serious doubts on our understanding of these intriguing objects.

which involve a scaling parameter $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$. The problem arises
from many physical models in some limit parameter regime or from some
time-compressed perturbation problems. The solution of the model exhibits rapid
temporal oscillations with $\mathcal{O}(1)$-amplitude and
$\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$-frequency, which makes classical numerical methods
inefficient. We apply the two-scale formulation approach to the problem and
propose two new time-symmetric numerical integrators. The methods are proved to
have the uniform second order accuracy for all $\varepsilon$ at finite times
and some near-conservation laws in long times. Numerical experiments on a
H\'{e}non-Heiles model, a nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation and a
charged-particle system illustrate the performance of the proposed methods over
the existing ones.

asymptotically, or otherwise obscured at best. By construing change as
essential time dependence, can one find change locally in Hamiltonian GR with
spinors?
  This paper is motivated by tendencies in space-time philosophy to slight
fermionic/spinorial matter, in Hamiltonian GR to misplace changes of time
coordinate, and in treatments of the Einstein-Dirac equation to include a
gratuitous local Lorentz gauge symmetry. Spatial dependence is dropped in most
of the paper. To include all and only the coordinate freedom, the
Einstein-Dirac equation is investigated using the Schwinger time gauge and
Kibble-Deser symmetric triad condition as a $3+1$ version of the
DeWitt-Ogievetsky-Polubarinov nonlinear group realization formalism that
dispenses with a tetrad and local Lorentz gauge freedom. Change is the lack of
a time-like stronger-than-Killing field for which the Lie derivative of the
metric-spinor complex vanishes. An appropriate $3+1$-friendly form of the
Rosenfeld-Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator $G$, a tuned sum of
first class-constraints, changes the canonical Lagrangian by a total derivative
and implements changes of time coordinate for solutions.

establishing an image-to-surface correspondence between RGB images and the 3D
surface of the human body, serving the foundation of rich real-world
applications, such as virtual humans, monocular-to-3d reconstruction. However,
the popular DensePose-COCO dataset relies on a sophisticated manual annotation
system, leading to severe limitations in acquiring the denser and more accurate
annotated pose resources. In this work, we introduce a new 3D human-body model
with a series of decoupled parameters that could freely control the generation
of the body. Furthermore, we build a data generation system based on this
decoupling 3D model, and construct an ultra dense synthetic benchmark
UltraPose, containing around 1.3 billion corresponding points. Compared to the
existing manually annotated DensePose-COCO dataset, the synthetic UltraPose has
ultra dense image-to-surface correspondences without annotation cost and error.
Our proposed UltraPose provides the largest benchmark and data resources for
lifting the model capability in predicting more accurate dense poses. To
promote future researches in this field, we also propose a transformer-based
method to model the dense correspondence between 2D and 3D worlds. The proposed
model trained on synthetic UltraPose can be applied to real-world scenarios,
indicating the effectiveness of our benchmark and model.

77,000 Reddit posts from the r/anxiety, r/depression, r/schizophrenia, and
r/do-it-your-own (r/DIY) forums into 5 cognitive networks, each one expressing
meanings and emotions as reported by authors. These networks reconstruct the
semantic frames surrounding 'feel', enabling a quantification of prominent
associations and emotions focused around feelings. We find strong feelings of
sadness across all clinical Reddit boards, added to fear r/depression, and
replaced by joy/anticipation in r/DIY. Semantic communities and topic modelling
both highlight key narrative topics of 'regret', 'unhealthy lifestyle' and 'low
mental well-being'. Importantly, negative associations and emotions co-existed
with trustful/positive language, focused on 'getting better'. This emotional
polarisation provides quantitative evidence that online clinical boards possess
a complex structure, where users mix both positive and negative outlooks. This
dichotomy is absent in the r/DIY reference board and in suicide notes, where
negative emotional associations about regret and pain persist but are
overwhelmed by positive jargon addressing loved ones. Our quantitative
comparisons provide strong evidence that suicide notes encapsulate different
ways of expressing feelings compared to online Reddit boards, the latter acting
more like personal diaries and relief valve. Our findings provide an
interpretable, quantitative aid for supporting psychological inquiries of human

and low reconstruction loss to Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples. This
increases Type II errors and leads to missed anomalies, overall decreasing
Anomaly Detection (AD) performance. In addition, AD models underperform due to
the rarity of anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose the OoD
Minimum Anomaly Score GAN (OMASGAN). OMASGAN generates, in a negative data
augmentation manner, anomalous samples on the estimated distribution boundary.
These samples are then used to refine an AD model, leading to more accurate
estimation of the underlying data distribution including multimodal supports
with disconnected modes. OMASGAN performs retraining by including the abnormal
minimum-anomaly-score OoD samples generated on the distribution boundary in a
self-supervised learning manner. For inference, for AD, we devise a
discriminator which is trained with negative and positive samples either
generated (negative or positive) or real (only positive). OMASGAN addresses the
rarity of anomalies by generating strong and adversarial OoD samples on the
distribution boundary using only normal class data, effectively addressing mode
collapse. A key characteristic of our model is that it uses any f-divergence
distribution metric in its variational representation, not requiring
invertibility. OMASGAN does not use feature engineering and makes no
assumptions about the data distribution. The evaluation of OMASGAN on image
data using the leave-one-out methodology shows that it achieves an improvement
of at least 0.24 and 0.07 points in AUROC on average on the MNIST and CIFAR-10

theoretical and experimental research. On the one hand, parity-time- ($\cal
PT$-) and anti-$\cal PT$-symmetric physics have gained ever-growing interest,
due to the existence of non-Hermitian spectral singularities called exceptional
points (EPs). On the other, topological and localization transitions in
non-Hermitian systems reveal new phenomena, e.g., the non-Hermitian skin effect
and the absence of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. The great
majority of previous studies exclusively focus on non-Hermitian Hamiltonians,
whose realization requires an {\it a priori} fine-tuned extended lattices to
exhibit topological and localization transition phenomena.In this work, we show
how the non-Hermitian localization phenomena can naturally emerge in the
synthetic field moments space of zero-dimensional bosonic systems, e.g., in
anti-$\cal PT$ and $\cal PT$-symmetric quantum dimers. This offers an
opportunity to simulate localization transitions in low-dimensional systems,
without the need to construct complex arrays of, e.g., coupled cavities or
waveguides. Indeed, the field moment equations of motion can describe an
equivalent (quasi-)particle moving in a one-dimensional (1D) synthetic lattice.
This synthetic field moments space can exhibit a nontrivial localization
phenomena, such as non-Hermitian skin effect, induced by the presence of
highly-degenerate EPs. We demonstrate our findings on the example of an
anti-$\cal PT$-symmetric two-mode system, whose higher-order field moments
eigenspace is emulated by a synthetic 1D non-Hermitian Hamiltonian having a
Sylvester matrix shape. Our results can be directly verified in
state-of-the-art optical setups, such as superconducting circuits and toroidal
resonators, by measuring photon moments or correlation functions.

first moment diverges exponentially fast in time, the stationary distribution,
which we derive analytically, is symmetric around a negative median and
exhibits a fat tail with $3/2$ decay exponent. We obtain a similar result for
the entanglement entropy production associated to a given interval of size
$\ell$. The corresponding stationary distribution has a $3/2$ right tail for
all $\ell$, and converges to a one-sided Levy stable for large $\ell$. Our
results are benchmarked via analytical and numerical calculations for a chain

information about protected groups from the prediction may fail to reduce, and
may even increase, ultimate disparities. While our concrete results rely on

low-light applications such as photography, microscopy, and astronomy. However,
the presence of photon shot noise due to low illumination and/or short exposure
makes the deblurring task substantially more challenging than the conventional
deblurring problems. In this paper, we present an algorithm unrolling approach
for the photon-limited deblurring problem by unrolling a Plug-and-Play
algorithm for a fixed number of iterations. By introducing a three-operator
splitting formation of the Plug-and-Play framework, we obtain a series of
differentiable steps which allows the fixed iteration unrolled network to be
trained end-to-end. The proposed algorithm demonstrates significantly better
image recovery compared to existing state-of-the-art deblurring approaches. We
also present a new photon-limited deblurring dataset for evaluating the
performance of algorithms.

in the sky and the limited angular resolution of wide field surveys. We show
that multiply imaged quasars can be identified using unresolved light curves,
without assuming a light curve template or any prior information. After
describing our method, we show using simulations that it can attain high
precision and recall when we consider high-quality data with negligible noise
well below the variability of the light curves. As the noise level increases to
that of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) telescope, we find that precision
can remain close to $100\%$ while recall drops to $\sim 60\%$. We also consider
some examples from the Time Delay Challenge 1 (TDC1) and demonstrate that the
time delays can be accurately recovered from the joint light curve data in
realistic observational scenarios. We further demonstrate our method by
applying it to publicly available COSMOGRAIL data of the observed lensed quasar
SDSS J1226-0006. We identify the system as a lensed quasar based on the
unresolved light curve and estimate a time delay in good agreement with the one
measured by COSMOGRAIL using the individual image light curves. The technique

optimization-based adversarial attack methods in the vision domain to craft
textual adversarial samples. In this framework, continuously optimized

decoded with a masked language model head to obtain potential adversarial

named Textual Projected Gradient Descent (T-PGD). We find our algorithm
effective even using proxy gradient information. Therefore, we perform the more
challenging transfer black-box attack and conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate our attack algorithm with several models on three benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves overall better
performance and produces more fluent and grammatical adversarial samples

practical definition for PRS as FRB associations with luminosity greater than
$10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ that is not attributed to star-formation

fraction of FRBs with PRS for repeaters and non-repeaters, showing there is not
yet evidence for repeaters to be preferentially associated with PRS. We discuss
how FRB/PRS sources may be distinguished by the combination of active
repetition and an excess dispersion measure local to the FRB environment. We
use CHIME/FRB event statistics to bound the mean per-source repetition rate of
FRBs to be between 25 and 440 yr$^{-1}$. We use this to provide a bound on the
density of FRB-emitting sources in the local universe of between
$2.2\times10^2$ and $5.2\times10^4$ Gpc$^{-3}$ assuming a pulsar-like beam
width for FRB emission. This density implies that PRS may comprise as much as
1\% of compact, luminous radio sources detected in the local universe. The
cosmic density and phenomenology of PRS are similar to that of the
newly-discovered, off-nuclear ""wandering"" AGN. We argue that it is likely that

observations generated by a different and unknown policy that may depend on the
unobserved state. We tackle two questions: what conditions allow us to identify

identification is made possible by the existence of so-called bridge functions.

is based on discrete building blocks and continuum spacetime is expected to
emerge from their collective dynamics, possibly at criticality, via a phase
transition. On a compact group of fixed volume this can be expected to be only
possible in a large-volume or thermodynamic limit. Here we show how phase
transitions are possible in TGFTs in two cases: a) considering the non-local
group degrees of freedom on a non-compact Lie group instead of a compact one
(or taking a large-volume limit of a compact group); b) in models including
$\mathbb{R}$-valued local degrees of freedom (that can be interpreted as
discrete scalar fields, often used in this context to provide a matter
reference frame). After adapting the Landau-Ginzburg approach to this setting
of mixed local/non-local degrees of freedom, we determine the critical
dimension beyond which there is a Gaussian fixed point and a continuous phase
transition which can be described by mean-field theory. This is an important
step towards the realization of a phase transition to continuum spacetime in
realistic TGFT models for quantum gravity.

With progress on the hardware, measuring a quantum system will become
increasingly demanding, particularly for variational protocols that require
extensive sampling. Here, we introduce a measurement scheme that adaptively
modifies the estimator based on previously obtained data. Our algorithm, which
we call AEQuO, continuously monitors both the estimated average and the
associated error of the considered observable, and determines the next
measurement step based on this information. We allow both for overlap and
non-bitwise commutation relations in the subsets of Pauli operators that are
simultaneously probed, thereby maximizing the amount of gathered information.
AEQuO comes in two variants: a greedy bucket-filling algorithm with good
performance for small problem instances, and a machine learning-based algorithm
with more favorable scaling for larger instances. The measurement configuration
determined by these subroutines is further post-processed in order to lower the
error on the estimator. We test our protocol on chemistry Hamiltonians, for
which AEQuO provides error estimates that improve on all state-of-the-art
methods based on various grouping techniques or randomized measurements, thus
greatly lowering the toll of measurements in current and future quantum
applications.

show that fully causal and stable phase-insensitive filters can improve the

phase-insensitive component in such systems is to provide frequency-dependent
compensation for the unwanted dispersion introduced by the position-sensing
optical cavity. The system's stability is achieved by limiting the frequency
band of this compensation. We demonstrate that stable optomechanical
PT-symmetric filters comprise a special subclass of such phase-insensitive
devices and find entirely new solutions which overcome the sensitivity of

convoluted latent representations of their input to issue a prediction. To
achieve greater transparency than a black-box that connects inputs to

representations. To that aim, we propose SimplEx: a user-centred method that
provides example-based explanations with reference to a freely selected set of
examples, called the corpus. SimplEx uses the corpus to improve the user's
understanding of the latent space with post-hoc explanations answering two
questions: (1) Which corpus examples explain the prediction issued for a given
test example? (2) What features of these corpus examples are relevant for the
model to relate them to the test example? SimplEx provides an answer by
reconstructing the test latent representation as a mixture of corpus latent
representations. Further, we propose a novel approach, the Integrated Jacobian,
that allows SimplEx to make explicit the contribution of each corpus feature in
the mixture. Through experiments on tasks ranging from mortality prediction to
image classification, we demonstrate that these decompositions are robust and
accurate. With illustrative use cases in medicine, we show that SimplEx
empowers the user by highlighting relevant patterns in the corpus that explain
model representations. Moreover, we demonstrate how the freedom in choosing the
corpus allows the user to have personalized explanations in terms of examples

Differ-entiable Physics (VRDP), that can jointly learn visual concepts and
infer physics models of objects and their interactions from videos and
language. This is achieved by seamlessly integrating three components: a visual
perception module, a concept learner, and a differentiable physics engine. The
visual perception module parses each video frame into object-centric
trajectories and represents them as latent scene representations. The concept
learner grounds visual concepts (e.g., color, shape, and material) from these
object-centric representations based on the language, thus providing prior
knowledge for the physics engine. The differentiable physics model, implemented
as an impulse-based differentiable rigid-body simulator, performs
differentiable physical simulation based on the grounded concepts to infer
physical properties, such as mass, restitution, and velocity, by fitting the
simulated trajectories into the video observations. Consequently, these learned
concepts and physical models can explain what we have seen and imagine what is
about to happen in future and counterfactual scenarios. Integrating
differentiable physics into the dynamic reasoning framework offers several
appealing benefits. More accurate dynamics prediction in learned physics models
enables state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks while still maintaining high transparency and interpretability; most
notably, VRDP improves the accuracy of predictive and counterfactual questions
by 4.5% and 11.5% compared to its best counterpart. VRDP is also highly
data-efficient: physical parameters can be optimized from very few videos, and
even a single video can be sufficient. Finally, with all physical parameters
inferred, VRDP can quickly learn new concepts from a few examples.

nonlinear ring resonator (NRR) operating based on standing wave resonation. The
proposed NRR generates two sustainable oscillation frequencies based on the
periodicity of the nonlinear circuit in the ring configuration. Due to the
symmetry and reciprocity of the ring layout, the two bidirectional ports can
excite the circuit at the two opposite nodes while maintaining the required
boundary conditions for oscillation. The sustainable resonance conditions occur
by creating zero, short impedance, or pole, infinite impedance, at subharmonic
and harmonic excitation ports. The NRR circuit consumes zero DC power and
covers two communication frequency plans interchangeably, which makes it a
premier technique compared to the conventional ultra-wideband (UWB)
localization system and conventional single-band nonlinear passive circuitry.
The latter is narrowband due to the tunning limitation of the nonlinear
varactor while the former is power-hungry approach with complex hardware

With regard to momentum space, the exact states behave as bona fide quantum
many body scars: they exhibit identically zero momentum-space entanglement,
while typical eigenstates behave thermally. We corroborate this finding by a
level statistics analysis. Furthermore, we detail the general formalism for
systematically finding all interaction terms and associated exact states, and
present a number of infinite exact state sequences extending to arbitrarily

follow from a special operator algebra. Instead, they are uniquely enabled by
the interplay of Fermi statistics and chirality.

harbors a Landauer-Sharvin resistance, inversely proportional to the number of

shown that hydrodynamic effects can reduce this resistance, raising the
question of the lower bound of resistance of hydrodynamic electrons. Here we
show that by a proper choice of device geometry, it is possible to spread the
Landauer-Sharvin resistance throughout the bulk of the system, allowing its
complete elimination by electron hydrodynamics. We trace the effect to the
dynamics of electrons flowing in channels that terminate within the sample. For
ballistic systems this termination leads to back-reflection of the electrons
and creates resistance. Hydrodynamically, the scattering of these electrons off
other electrons allows them to transfer to transmitted channels and avoid the
resistance. Counter-intuitively, we find that in contrast to the ohmic regime,
for hydrodynamic electrons the resistance of a device with a given width can
decrease with its length, suggesting that a long enough device may have an
arbitrarily small total resistance.

timescales two to three times shorter than those of typical Type Ia or Type II
supernovae (SNe), have uncertain progenitor systems and powering mechanisms.
Recent studies have noted similarities between rapidly evolving transients and
Type Ibn SNe, which are powered by ejecta interacting with He-rich
circumstellar material (CSM). In this work we present multiband photometric and
spectroscopic observations from Las Cumbres Observatory and Swift of four
fast-evolving Type Ibn SNe. We compare these observations with those of rapidly
evolving transients identified in the literature. We discuss several common
characteristics between these two samples, including their light curve and
color evolution as well as their spectral features. To investigate a common
powering mechanism we construct a grid of analytical model light curves with
luminosity inputs from CSM interaction as well as $^{56}$Ni radioactive decay.
We find that models with ejecta masses of $\approx 1-3$ M$_\odot$, CSM masses
of $\approx 0.2-1$ M$_\odot$, and CSM radii of $\approx 20-65$ au can explain
the diversity of peak luminosities, rise times, and decline rates observed in
Type Ibn SNe and rapidly evolving transients. This suggests that a common
progenitor system$-$the core collapse of a high-mass star within a dense CSM
shell$-$can reproduce the light curves of even the most luminous and
fast-evolving objects, such as AT 2018cow. This work is one of the first to
reproduce the light curves of both SNe Ibn and other rapidly evolving

formation of trapped surfaces in the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous

loop quantum cosmology was initially formulated. Its undesirable features in
cosmological models led to the so-called improved dynamics or the $\bar \mu$
scheme. While the jury is still out on the right scheme for black hole
spacetimes, we show that as far as the black hole formation is concerned the
$\mu_o$ scheme has another, so far unknown, serious problem. We find that in
the $\mu_o$ scheme no trapped surfaces would form for a non-singular collapse
of a homogeneous dust cloud in the marginally bound case unless the minimum
non-zero area of the loops over which holonomies are computed or the
Barbero-Immirzi parameter decreases almost four times from its standard value.
It turns out that the trapped surfaces in the $\mu_o$ scheme for the marginally
bound case are also forbidden for any arbitrary matter content as long as the
collapsing interior is isometric to a spatially flat
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. We find that in

globular clusters (GCs), while the smallest galaxies do not. Over what galaxy
mass range does the transition from GCs to no GCs occur? We investigate this
question using galaxies in the Local Group, nearby dwarf galaxies, and galaxies
in the Virgo Cluster Survey. We consider four types of statistical models: (1)
logistic regression to model the probability that a galaxy of stellar mass
$M_{\star}$ has any number of GCs; (2) Poisson regression to model the number
of GCs versus $M_{\star}$, (3) linear regression to model the relation between
GC system mass ($\log{M_{gcs}}$) and host galaxy mass ($\log{M_{\star}}$), and
(4) a Bayesian lognormal hurdle model of the GC system mass as a function of
galaxy stellar mass for the entire data sample. From the logistic regression,
we find that the 50% probability point for a galaxy to contain GCs is
$M_{\star}=10^{6.8}M_{\odot}$. From post-fit diagnostics, we find that Poisson
regression is an inappropriate description of the data. Ultimately, we find
that the Bayesian lognormal hurdle model, which is able to describe how the
mass of the GC system varies with $M_{\star}$ even in the presence of many
galaxies with no GCs, is the most appropriate model over the range of our data.

through these giant impacts that planets like the young Earth grow to their
final mass and achieve long-term stable orbital configurations. A key
prediction is that these impacts produce debris. To date, the most compelling
observational evidence for post-impact debris comes from the planetary system
around the nearby 23 Myr-old A star HD 172555. This system shows large amounts
of fine dust with an unusually steep size distribution and atypical dust
composition, previously attributed to either a hypervelocity impact or a
massive asteroid belt. Here, we report the spectrally resolved detection of a
CO gas ring co-orbiting with dusty debris between ~6-9 au - a region analogous
to the outer terrestrial planet region of our Solar System. Taken together, the
dust and CO detections favor a giant impact between large, volatile-rich
bodies. This suggests that planetary-scale collisions, analogous to the
Moon-forming impact, can release large amounts of gas as well as debris, and
that this gas is observable, providing a window into the composition of young
planets.

potential for constraining directly the properties of the hot gas that
dominates dark matter halos because it measures pressure and thus thermal
energy density. Studying this hot component of the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
is important because it is strongly impacted by star-formation and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in galaxies, participating in the feedback loop
that regulates star and black hole mass growth in galaxies.
  We study the tSZ effect across a wide halo mass range using three
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Illustris-TNG, EAGLE, and FIRE-2.
Specifically, we present the scaling relation between tSZ signal and halo mass
and radial profiles of gas density, temperature, and pressure for all three
simulations. The analysis includes comparisons to Planck tSZ observations and
to the thermal pressure profile inferred from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT) measurements. We compare these tSZ data to the simulations to interpret
the measurements in terms of feedback and accretion processes in the CGM. We
also identify as-yet unobserved potential signatures of these processes that
may be visible in future measurements, which will have the capability of
measuring tSZ signals to even lower masses. We also perform internal
comparisons between runs with different physical assumptions. We conclude: (1)
there is strong evidence for the impact of feedback at $R_{500}$ but that this
impact decreases by $5R_{500}$, and (2) the thermodynamic profiles of the CGM
are highly dependent on the implemented model, such as cosmic-ray or AGN
feedback prescriptions.

presents a detailed analysis of numerical simulations showing how kinetic AGN
feedback with a strong momentum flux interacts with the CGM. Our analysis shows
that large scale CGM circulation plays an important role in reconfiguring the
galactic atmosphere and regulating the atmosphere's central entropy level. We
find that most of the AGN energy output goes into lifting of circumgalactic gas
rather than heating of atmospheric gas within the galaxy, consequently
reconfiguring the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in our simulations. Large scale
(10s of kpc) circulation of the CGM on ~ 10-100 kpc scales therefore plays a
critical role in preventing over-cooling of gas in these simulated galaxies.
The simulations also show that our choices of accretion efficiency and jet
opening angle significantly affect the AGN-CGM coupling. Reducing the jet
opening angle to quarter of the fiducial opening angle increases the jet
momentum flux, enabling it to drill through to larger radii without effectively
coupling with the CGM at the center ( $r < 5$ kpc). Outflows with a lower
momentum flux decelerate and thermalize the bulk of their energy at smaller
radii ($r \lesssim 10$ ).

Inspired by great success of very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
this paper proposes a robust feature extraction method for SAR image target
classification by adaptively fusing effective features from different CNN
layers. First, YOLOv4 network is fine-tuned to detect the targets from the
respective MF SAR target images. Second, a very deep CNN is trained from
scratch on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR)
database by using small filters throughout the whole net to reduce the speckle
noise. Besides, using small-size convolution filters decreases the number of
parameters in each layer and, therefore, reduces computation cost as the CNN
goes deeper. The resulting CNN model is capable of extracting very deep
features from the target images without performing any noise filtering or
pre-processing techniques. Third, our approach proposes to use the
multi-canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) to adaptively learn CNN features
from different layers such that the resulting representations are highly
linearly correlated and therefore can achieve better classification accuracy
even if a simple linear support vector machine is used. Experimental results on
the MSTAR dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods.

rule-based coalition formation scheme deals with the zonal voltage difference
caused by the uneven integration of PV capacity. Under this scheme, PV
inverters form into separate voltage regulation coalitions autonomously
according to local, neighbor as well as coalition voltage magnitude and
regulation capacity information. To coordinate control within each coalition,
we develop a feedback-based leader-follower consensus algorithm which
eliminates the voltage violations caused by the fast fluctuations of load and
PV generation. This algorithm allocates the required reactive power
contribution among the PV inverters according to their maximum available
capacity to promote an effective and fair use of the overall voltage regulation
capacity. Case studies based on realistic distribution networks and
field-recorded data validate the effectiveness of the proposed control
strategy. Moreover, comparison with a centralized network decomposition-based
scheme shows the flexibility of coalition formation in organizing the

where commercial applications of the technology become viable. However, the low
open-circuit voltage (Voc) of OSCs relative to their optical gap still limits
PCEs to below 20%. A key factor contributing to the large Voc deficit in OSCs
is non-radiative recombination to spin-triplet excitons, which is widely, but
not universally, observed in blends using both fullerene and non-fullerene
electron acceptors. Here, we present an experimental framework that combines
time resolved optical and magnetic resonance spectroscopies to detect triplet
excitons and identify their formation mechanisms. We apply our methodology to
two well-studied polymer:fullerene systems, PM6:PC60BM and PTB7-Th:PC60BM,
enabling us to selectively investigate distinct triplet formation pathways. In
contrast to the more efficient non-fullerene acceptor systems that show only
triplet states formed via non-geminate recombination, the fullerene systems
also show significant triplet formation via geminate processes. We associate
this with electrons trapped at the isolated fullerenes that sit within the
alkyl sidechains of the donor polymers. Thus, our model study demonstrates how
these complex and overlapping processes can be successfully deconvoluted to
reveal the intricacies of triplet generation dynamics in OSC blends.

The goal is to do this in an error-resilient way, such that even given some
fraction of adversarial corruptions to the protocol, both parties still learn
$f(x,y)$.
  In this work, we study the optimal error resilience of such a protocol in the
face of adversarial bit flip or erasures. While the optimal error resilience of
such a protocol over a large alphabet is well understood, the situation over
the binary alphabet has remained open. In this work, we resolve this problem of
determining the optimal error resilience over binary channels. In particular,
we construct protocols achieving $\frac16$ error resilience over the binary bit
flip channel and $\frac12$ error resilience over the binary erasure channel,
for both of which matching upper bounds are known. We remark that the
communication complexity of our binary bit flip protocol is polynomial in the

transduced into electrical signals, have received sparse investigation by
considering electromechanical simulations in simplified scenarios. In this
paper, we study the effects of different MEFs modeling choices for myocardial
deformation and nonselective stretch-activated channels (SACs) in the
monodomain equation. We perform numerical simulations during ventricular
tachycardia (VT) by employing a biophysically detailed and anatomically
accurate 3D electromechanical model for the left ventricle (LV) coupled with a
0D closed-loop model of the cardiocirculatory system. We model the
electromechanical substrate responsible for scar-related VT with a distribution
of infarct and peri-infarct zones. Our mathematical framework takes into
account the hemodynamic effects of VT due to myocardial impairment and allows
for the classification of their hemodynamic nature, which can be either stable
or unstable. By combining electrophysiological, mechanical and hemodynamic
models, we observe that all MEFs may alter the propagation of the action
potential and the morphology of the VT. In particular, we notice that the
presence of myocardial deformation in the monodomain equation may change the VT
basis cycle length and the conduction velocity but do not affect the
hemodynamic nature of the VT. Finally, nonselective SACs may affect wavefront
stability, by possibly turning a hemodynamically stable VT into a
hemodynamically unstable one and vice versa.

make an accurate prediction is not sufficient. In general, by allowing a reject
option, one expects the performance of a regression model to increase at the

we show, in some cases, the performance of a minority subgroup can decrease
while we reduce the coverage, and thus selective regression can magnify
disparities between different sensitive subgroups. Motivated by these
disparities, we propose new fairness criteria for selective regression
requiring the performance of every subgroup to improve with a decrease in
coverage. We prove that if a feature representation satisfies the sufficiency
criterion or is calibrated for mean and variance, than the proposed fairness
criteria is met. Further, we introduce two approaches to mitigate the
performance disparity across subgroups: (a) by regularizing an upper bound of
conditional mutual information under a Gaussian assumption and (b) by
regularizing a contrastive loss for conditional mean and conditional variance
prediction. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated on synthetic

of functional relationship between response and covariates among different
groups. The main idea, which is intuitive and easy to implement, is to keep the
projections of the response vector $\boldsymbol{Y}$ on leading principle
components of a kernel matrix fixed and permute $\boldsymbol{Y}$'s projections
on the remaining principle components. The proposed test allows for different
choices of kernels, corresponding to different classes of functions under the
null hypothesis. First, using linear or polynomial kernels, our partial
permutation tests are exactly valid in finite samples for linear or polynomial
regression models with Gaussian noise; similar results straightforwardly extend
to kernels with finite feature spaces. Second, by allowing the kernel feature
space to diverge with the sample size, the test can be large-sample valid for a
wider class of functions. Third, for general kernels with possibly
infinite-dimensional feature space, the partial permutation test is exactly
valid when the covariates are exactly balanced across all groups, or
asymptotically valid when the underlying function follows certain regularized
Gaussian processes. We further suggest test statistics using likelihood ratio
between two (nested) GPR models, and propose computationally efficient
algorithms utilizing the EM algorithm and Newton's method, where the latter
also involves Fisher scoring and quadratic programming and is particularly
useful when EM suffers from slow convergence. Extensions to correlated and
non-Gaussian noises have also been investigated theoretically or numerically.
Furthermore, the test can be extended to use multiple kernels together and can
thus enjoy properties from each kernel. Both simulation study and application
illustrate the properties of the proposed test.

protection mechanisms have been developed in the literature to protect
sensitive data from adversarial analysis and eliminate the risk of
re-identifying the original properties of shared data. However, most of the
existing solutions have drawbacks, such as (i) lack of a proper vulnerability
characterization model to accurately identify where privacy is needed, (ii)
ignoring data providers privacy preference, (iii) using uniform privacy
protection which may create inadequate privacy for some provider while
overprotecting others, and (iv) lack of a comprehensive privacy quantification
model assuring data privacy-preservation. To address these issues, we propose a
personalized privacy preference framework by characterizing and quantifying the
CPS vulnerabilities as well as ensuring privacy. First, we introduce a Standard
Vulnerability Profiling Library (SVPL) by arranging the nodes of an energy-CPS
from maximum to minimum vulnerable based on their privacy loss. Based on this
model, we present our personalized privacy framework (PDP) in which Laplace
noise is added based on the individual node's selected privacy preferences.
Finally, combining these two proposed methods, we demonstrate that our privacy
characterization and quantification model can attain better privacy
preservation by eliminating the trade-off between privacy, utility, and risk of
losing information.

plane. Almost three decades ago, an elegant polynomial-time algorithm was found
for \textsc{Maximum Clique} on unit disk graphs [Clark, Colbourn, Johnson;
Discrete Mathematics '90]. Since then, it has been an intriguing open question
whether or not tractability can be extended to general disk graphs. We show
that the disjoint union of two odd cycles is never the complement of a disk
graph nor of a unit (3-dimensional) ball graph. From that fact and existing
results, we derive a simple QPTAS and a subexponential algorithm running in
time $2^{\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})}$ for \textsc{Maximum Clique} on disk and unit ball
graphs. We then obtain a randomized EPTAS for computing the independence number
on graphs having no disjoint union of two odd cycles as an induced subgraph,
bounded VC-dimension, and linear independence number. This, in combination with
our structural results, yields a randomized EPTAS for \textsc{Max Clique} on
disk and unit ball graphs. \textsc{Max Clique} on unit ball graphs is
equivalent to finding, given a collection of points in $\mathbb R^3$, a maximum
subset of points with diameter at most some fixed value. In stark contrast,
\textsc{Maximum Clique} on ball graphs and unit $4$-dimensional ball graphs, as
well as intersection graphs of filled ellipses (even close to unit disks) or
filled triangles is unlikely to have such algorithms. Indeed, we show that, for
all those problems, there is a constant ratio of approximation which cannot be
attained even in time $2^{n^{1-\varepsilon}}$, unless the Exponential Time
Hypothesis fails.

applications in computational biology, but recognizing them has remained a

present an algorithm that decides whether a graph $G$ is a $k$-leaf power in

growth rate of a power tower function).
  Our techniques are based on the fact that either a $k$-leaf power has a
corresponding tree of low maximum degree, in which case finding it is easy, or
every corresponding tree has large maximum degree. In the latter case, large
degree vertices in the tree imply that $G$ has redundant substructures which

also obtained. This condition coincides with the usual Kalman controllability

The discharge and the flame are of comparable size, and the discharge is
favoured at a location where it is coupled with the reaction zone and burned
gas. The primary goal is to determine how the discharge evolves on the time
scale of the flame passage, with the evolution driven by the changing gas state
produced by the moving flame front. This work complements the large body of
work investigating the effect of plasma to modify flame dynamics, by
considering the other side of the interaction (how the discharge is modified by
the flame). The hot gas produced by the combustion had a strong effect on the
discharge, with the discharge preferentially forming in the region of hot
combustion products. The per-pulse energy deposited by the discharge was
measured and found to increase with the size of the discharge region and
applied voltage. The pulse repetition frequency did not have a direct impact on
the per-pulse energy, but did have an effect on the morphology and size of the
discharge region. Two distinct discharge regimes were observed: uniform and
filamentary (microdischarges). Higher pulse repetition frequencies and
faster-cooling combustion products were more likely to transition to the
filamentary regime, while lower frequencies and slower-cooling combustion
products maintained a uniform regime for the entirety of the time the discharge
was active. This regime transition was influenced by the ratio of the time
scale of fluid motion to the pulse repetition rate. This work demonstrates the
importance of considering how the discharge properties will change due to
combustion processes in applications utilizing plasma assistance for transient

anomalous scatter and other experimental artifacts. Incorporating
machine-learned models could prove beneficial for accurate density
reconstruction particularly in dynamic imaging, where the time-evolution of the
density fields could be captured by partial differential equations or by
learning from hydrodynamics simulations. In this work, we demonstrate the
ability of learned deep neural networks to perform artifact removal in noisy
density reconstructions, where the noise is imperfectly characterized. We use a
Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN), where the generator serves
as a denoiser that removes artifacts in densities obtained from traditional
reconstruction algorithms. We train the networks from large density time-series
datasets, with noise simulated according to parametric random distributions
that may mimic noise in experiments. The WGAN is trained with noisy density
frames as generator inputs, to match the generator outputs to the distribution
of clean densities (time-series) from simulations. A supervised loss is also
included in the training, which leads to improved density restoration
performance. In addition, we employ physics-based constraints such as mass
conservation during network training and application to further enable highly
accurate density reconstructions. Our preliminary numerical results show that
the models trained in our frameworks can remove significant portions of unknown
noise in density time-series data.

reach another node of the network may be significantly decreased. In other

we derive a general criterion for finite networks that establishes when there

instantaneous resetting, but above 1 and depends on the minimal mean first

highly depend on the splitting process. As a consequence, it may yield
inaccurate and misleading hidden representations, thus deteriorating the final

a hierarchical framework that can generate accurate dense representations of
passages by utilizing both macroscopic semantics in the document and
microscopic semantics specific to each passage. Specifically, a document-level
retriever first identifies relevant documents, among which relevant passages
are then retrieved by a passage-level retriever. The ranking of the retrieved
passages will be further calibrated by examining the document-level relevance.
In addition, hierarchical title structure and two negative sampling strategies
(i.e., In-Doc and In-Sec negatives) are investigated. We apply DHR to
large-scale open-domain QA datasets. DHR significantly outperforms the original
dense passage retriever and helps an end-to-end QA system outperform the strong

Meanwhile, Faster R-CNN is introduced to identify the labels, and the
projection relationship between images and the model is used to localize the

solution NMR signatures of magnetically-dilute spin pools; in particular
species at low concentrations undergoing chemical exchanges with an abundant
spin pool. CEST's main feature involves encoding and then detecting the weak
NMR signals of the magnetically dilute spin pools on a magnetically abundant
spin pool of much easier detection - for instance the protons of H2O. Inspired
by this method, we propose and exemplify a methodology to enhance the
sensitivity of magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR spectra. Our proposal
uses the abundant 1H reservoir arising in organic solids as the magnetically
abundant spin pool, and relies on proton spin diffusion in lieu of chemical
exchange to mediate polarization transfer between a magnetically dilute spin
pool and this magnetically abundant spin reporter. As an initial test of this
idea we target the spectroscopy of naturally-abundant 13C, and rely on a
Fourier-encoded version of the CEST experiment for achieving broadbandness in
coordination with both MAS and heteronuclear decoupling - features normally
absent in CEST. Arbitrary evolutions of multiple 13C sites can thus be
imprinted on the entire 1H reservoir, which is subsequently detected.
Theoretical predictions suggest that orders-of-magnitude signal enhancements
should be achievable in this manner - on the order of the ratio between the 13C
and the 1H reservoirs' abundances. Experiments carried out under magic-angle
spinning conditions evidenced ca. 5-10x enhancements. Further opportunities and
challenges arising in this Fourier-Encoded Saturation Transfer (FEST) MAS NMR
approach are briefly discussed.

expansion of the Theory of Figures, which is a fast method for gravity field
and shape computation, to the 7th-order (ToF7), which allows for computation of
up to J14. We apply three different codes to compare the accuracy using
polytropic models. We apply ToF7 to Jupiter and Saturn interior models in
conjunction with CMS-19 H/He-EOS. For Jupiter, we find that J6 is best matched
by a transition from He-depleted to He-enriched envelope at 2-2.5 Mbar.
However, the atmospheric metallicity reaches 1xtimes solar only if the adiabat
is perturbed toward lower densities, or if the surface temperature is enhanced
by ~14 K from the Galileo value. Our Saturn models imply a largely
homogeneous-in-Z envelope at 1.5-4x solar atop a small core. Perturbing the
adiabat yields metallicity profiles with extended, heavy-element enriched deep

compact, dilute, or no core are possible as long as the deep interior is
enriched in heavy-elements. Including a thermal wind fitted to the observed

social media, operated by misinformation campaigns to influence public opinion
and manipulate social outcomes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to
develop an effective methodology for coordinated group detection to combat the
misinformation on social media. However, existing works suffer from various
drawbacks, such as, either limited performance due to extreme reliance on
predefined signatures of coordination, or instead an inability to address the
natural sparsity of account activities on social media with useful prior domain
knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a coordination detection
framework incorporating neural temporal point process with prior knowledge such
as temporal logic or pre-defined filtering functions. Specifically, when
modeling the observed data from social media with neural temporal point
process, we jointly learn a Gibbs-like distribution of group assignment based
on how consistent an assignment is to (1) the account embedding space and (2)
the prior knowledge. To address the challenge that the distribution is hard to
be efficiently computed and sampled from, we design a theoretically guaranteed
variational inference approach to learn a mean-field approximation for it.
Experimental results on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our
proposed method compared to the SOTA model in both unsupervised and
semi-supervised settings. We further apply our model on a COVID-19 Vaccine
Tweets dataset. The detection result suggests the presence of suspicious
coordinated efforts on spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.

self-sustained combustion. The objective of the current study is to
quantitatively examine the ignition characteristics of fine iron particles
governed by the kinetics of solid-phase iron oxidation. The oxidation rates are
inversely proportional to the thickness of the oxide layer and calibrated using
the experimentally measured growth of iron-oxide layers over time. Steady-state
and unsteady analysis have been performed to probe the dependence of the
critical gas temperature required to trigger a thermal runaway (namely, the
ignition temperature $T_\mathrm{ign}$) on particle size, initial thickness of
oxide layer, inert gas species, radiative heat loss, and the collective heating
effect in a suspension of particles. Both analyses indicate that
$T_\mathrm{ign}$ depends on $\delta_0$, i.e., the ratio between the initial
oxide layer thickness and particle size, regardless of the absolute size of the
particle. The unsteady analysis predicts that, for $\delta_0 \lesssim 0.003$,
$T_\mathrm{ign}$ becomes independent of $\delta_0$. Under standard conditions
in air, $T_\mathrm{ign}$ is approximately 1080 K for any particle size greater
than 5 microns. Radiative heat loss has a minor effect on $T_\mathrm{ign}$. The
collective effect of a suspension of iron particles in reducing
$T_\mathrm{ign}$ is demonstrated. The transition behavior between
kinetic-controlled and external-diffusion-controlled combustion regimes of an
ignited iron particle is systematically examined. The influences of initial
oxide-layer thickness and particle temperature on the ignition delay time,
$\tau_\mathrm{ign}$, of iron particles are parametrically probed. A $d^2$-law
scaling between $\tau_\mathrm{ign}$ and particle size is identified.

each other, can be roughly described by a model in which the exterior surfaces
of the grains evolve by surface diffusion and the grain boundary, namely the
contact surface between the adjacent grains, evolves by motion by mean
curvature. We consider an axi-symmetric two grain system, contained within an
inert bounding semi-infinite cylinder with a hole along the axis of symmetry.
Boundary conditions are imposed reflecting the considerations of W.W. Mullins,

  We focus here on the steady states of this system. At steady state, the
exterior surfaces have constant and equal mean curvatures, and the grain
boundary has zero mean curvature; the exterior surfaces are nodoids and the
grain boundary surface is a catenoid. The physical parameters in the model can
be expressed via two angles $\beta$ and $\theta_c$, which depend on the surface
free energies. Typically if a steady state solution exists for given values of
$(\beta, \theta_c)$, then there exists a continuum of such solutions. In
particular, we prove that there exists a continuum of solutions with
$\theta_c=\pi$ for any $\beta \in (\pi/2, \pi)$.

prediction phase. In the discrete intention prediction phase, a Bayesian
network is adopted to predict the vehicle's high-level intention, after that,
maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning is utilized to learn the human
driving model offline; during the online trajectory prediction phase, a driver
characteristic is designed and updated to capture the different driving
preferences between human drivers. We applied the proposed framework to one of
the most challenging scenarios in autonomous driving: the yellow light running
scenario. Numerical experiment results are presented in the later part of the
paper which show the viability of the method. The accuracy of the Bayesian
network for discrete intention prediction is 91.1%, and the prediction results
are getting more and more accurate as the yellow time elapses. The average

combines the variational characterization of the free energy and convex

requires a building agent to assemble unit primitives (i.e., LEGO bricks)
sequentially -- every connection between two bricks must follow a fixed rule,
while no bricks mutually overlap. To construct a target object, we provide
incomplete knowledge about the desired target (i.e., 2D images) instead of
exact and explicit volumetric information to the agent. This problem requires a
comprehensive understanding of partial information and long-term planning to
append a brick sequentially, which leads us to employ reinforcement learning.
The approach has to consider a variable-sized action space where a large number
of invalid actions, which would cause overlap between bricks, exist. To resolve
these issues, our model, dubbed Brick-by-Brick, adopts an action validity
prediction network that efficiently filters invalid actions for an actor-critic
network. We demonstrate that the proposed method successfully learns to
construct an unseen object conditioned on a single image or multiple views of a
target object.

docking simulations require a significant amount of domain knowledge to set up
correctly which hampers adoption. To this end, we present DOCKSTRING, a bundle
for meaningful and robust comparison of ML models consisting of three

time evolution describing the flow of information from the initial single

learning. Extending the successes in supervised learning methods to the
reinforcement learning (RL) setting, however, is difficult due to the data
generating process - RL agents actively query their environment for data, and
the data are a function of the policy followed by the agent. An agent could
thus neglect a shift in the environment if its policy did not lead it to
explore the aspect of the environment that shifted. Therefore, to achieve safe
and robust generalization in RL, there exists an unmet need for OOD detection
through active experimentation. Here, we attempt to bridge this lacuna by first
defining a causal framework for OOD scenarios or environments encountered by RL
agents in the wild. Then, we propose a novel task: that of Out-of-Task
Distribution (OOTD) detection. We introduce an RL agent that actively
experiments in a test environment and subsequently concludes whether it is OOTD
or not. We name our method GalilAI, in honor of Galileo Galilei, as it
discovers, among other causal processes, that gravitational acceleration is
independent of the mass of a body. Finally, we propose a simple probabilistic
neural network baseline for comparison, which extends extant Model-Based RL. We

surface melt, and ultimately in driving ice flow and ice shelf melt through
injecting water into the subglacial environment and facilitating fracturing.
Here, we develop a model for the drainage of supraglacial lakes through the
dissipation-driven incision of a surface channel. The model consists of the St
Venant equations for flow in the channel, fed by an upstream lake reservoir,
coupled with an equation for the evolution of channel elevation due to
advection, uplift, and downward melting. After reduction to a `stream
power'-type hyperbolic model, we show that lake drainage occurs above a
critical rate of water supply to the lake due to the backward migration of a
shock that incises the lake seal. The critical water supply rate depends on
advection velocity and uplift (or more precisely, drawdown downstream of the
lake) as well as model parameters such as channel wall roughness and the
parameters defining the relationship between channel cross-section and wetted
perimeter. Once lake drainage does occur, it can either continue until the lake
is empty, or terminate early, leading to oscillatory cycles of lake filling and
draining, with the latter favoured by large lake volumes and relatively small

areas such as medicine and economics, to provide crucial instruction on the
early-stop of the online experiment and timely feedback from the environment.
Policy evaluation in online learning thus attracts increasing attention by
inferring the mean outcome of the optimal policy (i.e., the value) in
real-time. Yet, such a problem is particularly challenging due to the dependent
data generated in the online environment, the unknown optimal policy, and the
complex exploration and exploitation trade-off in the adaptive experiment. In
this paper, we aim to overcome these difficulties in policy evaluation for
online learning. We explicitly derive the probability of exploration that
quantifies the probability of exploring the non-optimal actions under commonly
used bandit algorithms. We use this probability to conduct valid inference on
the online conditional mean estimator under each action and develop the doubly
robust interval estimation (DREAM) method to infer the value under the
estimated optimal policy in online learning. The proposed value estimator
provides double protection on the consistency and is asymptotically normal with
a Wald-type confidence interval provided. Extensive simulations and real data
applications are conducted to demonstrate the empirical validity of the
proposed DREAM method.

necessitate a trade-off between accuracy and fairness. Many existing studies
have proposed correction methods such as adding fairness constraints to a
ranking model's loss. However, the challenge of correcting the data bias for
fair ranking remains, and the trade-off of the ranking models leaves room for
improvement. In this paper, we propose a fair ranking framework that evaluates
the order of training data in a pairwise manner as well as various fairness
measurements in ranking. This study is the first proposal of a pre-processing
method that solves fair ranking problems using the pairwise ordering method
with our best knowledge. The fair pairwise ordering method is prominent in
training the fair ranking models because it ensures that the resulting ranking
likely becomes parity across groups. As far as the fairness measurements in
ranking are represented as a linear constraint of the ranking models, we proved
that the minimization of loss function subject to the constraints is reduced to
the closed solution of the minimization problem augmented by weights to
training data. This closed solution inspires us to present a practical and
stable algorithm that iterates the optimization of weights and model
parameters. The empirical results over real-world datasets demonstrated that
our method outperforms the existing methods in the trade-off between accuracy

unbiased exploration discovers diverse 22 putative DTSPs, and thereby 60
putative DTSPs are identified in total including the 38 DTSPs discussed by the
previous study. Some of the discovered DTSPs are well-ordered, for example, the
medium spheres in the (9-7-3) structure are placed in a straight line with
comprising the unit cell, and the DTSP has the $Pm \bar{3}m$ symmetry if the
structural distortion is corrected. At a considerable number of radius ratios,
the highest packing fractions are achieved by the phase separations consisting
of only the FCC and/or the putative densest binary sphere packings (DBSPs) for
all compositions, and the tendency is getting evident as the small and medium
spheres are getting larger. The result seems to indicate directly that the
local structures in the DBSPs may be denser than those consisting of three
kinds of spheres. However, the unit cell of undiscovered DTSPs might only be
much larger than in this study due to the complexity of the ternary local
structures. Finally, we discuss the correspondence of the DTSPs with real

derive the group velocity property when a high-order Runge-Kutta scheme is used

rationality of the QL-DRP method is verified by a numerical simulation and the
discrete Fourier transform method. To further evaluate the performance of a

designed. The validity of QL-DRP and the group velocity preservation of several

Distribution. The amplitudes of the hits are distributed to well below the
energy loss of a traditional ``average minimum-ionizing proton'' as a result of
statistical fluctuations in the ionization loss within the detectors.
Nonetheless, hits with amplitudes less than a few hundred electrons are rare;
this places nearly all hits in an amplitude range that is readily identified
given the read noises of modern solid-state detectors. The spread of individual
hits over multiple pixels is dominated by geometric effects, i.e., the range of
incident angles, but shows a modest excess probably due to: (1) showering and
scattering of particles; (2) the energy imparted on the ionization products by
the energetic protons; and (3) interpixel capacitance. Although this study is

  Masked Language Model",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding protein sequences is vital and urgent for biology, healthcare,
and medicine. Labeling approaches are expensive yet time-consuming, while the
amount of unlabeled data is increasing quite faster than that of the labeled
data due to low-cost, high-throughput sequencing methods. In order to extract
knowledge from these unlabeled data, representation learning is of significant
value for protein-related tasks and has great potential for helping us learn
more about protein functions and structures. The key problem in the protein
sequence representation learning is to capture the co-evolutionary information
reflected by the inter-residue co-variation in the sequences. Instead of
leveraging multiple sequence alignment as is usually done, we propose a novel
method to capture this information directly by pre-training via a dedicated
language model, i.e., Pairwise Masked Language Model (PMLM). In a conventional
masked language model, the masked tokens are modeled by conditioning on the
unmasked tokens only, but processed independently to each other. However, our
proposed PMLM takes the dependency among masked tokens into consideration,
i.e., the probability of a token pair is not equal to the product of the
probability of the two tokens. By applying this model, the pre-trained encoder
is able to generate a better representation for protein sequences. Our result
shows that the proposed method can effectively capture the inter-residue
correlations and improves the performance of contact prediction by up to 9%
compared to the MLM baseline under the same setting. The proposed model also
significantly outperforms the MSA baseline by more than 7% on the TAPE contact
prediction benchmark when pre-trained on a subset of the sequence database
which the MSA is generated from, revealing the potential of the sequence
pre-training method to surpass MSA based methods in general.

higher-order graph information to GNNs and for systematically learning a local

algorithm. As a result, the new framework enables us to harness both the

proposed to mitigate the issue. Confidence ratio is simple to compute and
readily available without extra training. However, confidence ratio is reported
to only partially address the problem. In addition, confidence ratio
formulation is susceptible to computational instability. This article proposes
alternative formulations to confidence ratio, investigates an issue of non-sign

analyze observations of a polar coronal hole including the filtergrams that
were taken by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) at the H{\alpha}-0.6
{\AA}to study the H{\alpha} jets,and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171
{\AA} images to follow the evolution of coronal activities. H{\alpha} jets are
persistent in the network regions, only some regions (denoted as R1-R5) are
rooted with discernible coronal plumes.With an automated method, we identify
and track 1 320 H{\alpha} jets in the network regions. We find that the average
lifetime, height and ascending speed of the H{\alpha} jets are 75.38 s, 2.67
Mm, 65.60 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The H{\alpha} jets rooted in R1-R5 are
higher and faster than those in the others. We also find that propagating
disturbances (PDs) in coronal plumes have a close connection with the H{\alpha}
jets. The speeds of 28 out of 29 H{\alpha} jets associated with PDs are about
50 km s$^{-1}$ . In a case of coronal jet, we find that the speeds of both the
coronal jet and the H{\alpha} jet are over 150 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting that
both cool and hot jets can be coupled together. Based on our analyses, it is
evident that more dynamic H{\alpha} jets could release the energies to the
corona, which might be the results of the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (KHi) or small-scaled magnetic activities. We suggest that
chromospheric jets, transition region network jets and ray-like features in the

focusing in the full field of view. However, it suffers from low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low frame rate, because each array element must
be activated individually. In our previous study, we encoded all the array
elements with partial Hadamard matrix and reconstructed the complete STA
dataset with compressed sensing (CS) algorithm (CS-STA). As all the elements
are activated in each transmission and the number of transmissions is smaller
than that of STA, this method can achieve higher SNR and higher frame rate. Its
main drawback is the time-consuming CS reconstruction. In this study, we
accelerate the complete STA dataset reconstruction with minimal l2-norm least
square method. Thanks of the orthogonality of partial Hadamard matrix, the
minimal l2-norm least square solution can be easily calculated. The proposed
method is tested with simulation data and experimental phantom and in-vivo
data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves ~5*10^3 times
faster reconstruction speed than CS algorithm. The simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of achieving the same accuracy
for STA dataset reconstruction as conventional CS-STA method. The simulations,
phantom and in-vivo experiments show that the proposed method is capable of
improving the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) and SNR with
maintained spatial resolution and fewer transmissions, compared with STA. In
conclusion, the improved image quality and reduced computational time of LS-STA
pave the way for its real-time applications in the clinics.

subject-specific head model, where the goal is to quantify uncertainty in the
simulated strain fields (i.e., output), given variability in the material
properties of different brain substructures (i.e., input). In the first stage,
a data-driven method based on multi-dimensional Gaussian kernel-density
estimation and diffusion maps is used to generate realizations of the input
random vector directly from the available data. Computational simulations of a
small number of realizations provide input-output pairs for training
data-driven surrogate models in the second stage. The surrogate models employ
nonlinear dimensionality reduction using Grassmannian diffusion maps, Gaussian
process regression to create a low-cost mapping between the input random vector
and the reduced solution space, and geometric harmonics models for mapping
between the reduced space and the Grassmann manifold. It is demonstrated that
the surrogate models provide highly accurate approximations of the
computational model while significantly reducing the computational cost. Monte
Carlo simulations of the surrogate models are used for uncertainty propagation.
UQ of strain fields highlight significant spatial variation in model
uncertainty, and reveal key differences in uncertainty among commonly used

Tight binaries are an important heating source that influences the long-term
dynamical evolution of star clusters. However, due to the limitation of
$N$-body tool, previous theoretical modelling for globular clusters (GCs) by
using direct $N$-body simulations have not investigated how a large fraction of
primordial binaries affect their long-term evolution. In this work, by using
the high-performance $N$-body code, PeTar, we carry out star-by-star models for
intermediate massive GCs ($N=100000$) with the primordial binary fraction
varying from 0 to 1. We find that when a stellar-mass black hole (BH) subsystem
exists, the structural evolution of GCs (core and half-mass radii) only depends
on the properties of massive primordial binaries, because they affect the
number of BH binaries (BBHs), which dominate the binary heating process.
Low-mass binaries including double white dwarf binaries (BWDs) have almost no
influence on the dynamics. Meanwhile, only gravitational wave (GW) mergers from
BBHs are strongly affected by dynamical interactions, while low-mass mergers
from BWDs show no difference in the isolated environment (field) and in GCs.
Low-mass binaries become important only after most BHs escape and the core
collapse of light stars occurs. Our result suggests that for $N$-body modelling
of GCs with a black hole subsystem dominating binary heating, it is not
necessary to include low-mass binaries. These binaries can be studied
separately by using standalone binary stellar evolution codes. This way can
significantly reduce the computing cost.

ESO's VLTI has
established a stable, robust infrastructure for long-baseline interferometry
for general astronomical observers. The present second-generation instruments
offer a wide wavelength coverage and improved performance. Their sensitivity
and measurement accuracy lead to data and images of high reliability. Aims:We
have developed MATISSE, the Multi AperTure mid-Infrared SpectroScopic
Experiment, to access high resolution imaging in a wide spectral domain and
explore topics such: stellar activity and mass loss; planet formation and
evolution in the gas and dust disks around young stars; accretion processes
around super massive black holes in AGN. Methods:The instrument is a
spectro-interferometric imager covering three atmospheric bands (L,M,N) from
2.8 to 13.0 mu, combining four optical beams from the VLTI's telscopes. Its
concept, related observing procedure, data reduction and calibration approach
are the product of 30 years of instrumental research. The instrument utilizes a
multi-axial beam combination that delivers spectrally dispersed fringes. The
signal provides the following quantities at several spectral resolutions:
photometric flux, coherent fluxes, visibilities, closure phases, wavelength
differential visibilities and phases, and aperture-synthesis imaging.
Results:We provide an overview of the physical principle of the instrument and
its functionalities, the characteristics of the delivered signal, a description
of the observing modes and of their performance limits. An ensemble of data and
reconstructed images are illustrating the first acquired key observations.
Conclusion:The instrument has been in operation at Cerro Paranal, ESO, Chile
since 2018, and has been open for science use by the international community
since April 2019. The first scientific results are being published now.

the world, as it incurs traffic jams, which lead to air pollution and traffic
accidents. The government highly relies on active human efforts to detect
illegal parking events. However, such an approach is extremely ineffective to
cover a large city since the police have to patrol over the entire city roads.
  The massive and high-quality sharing bike trajectories from Mobike offer us a
unique opportunity to design a ubiquitous illegal parking detection approach,
as most of the illegal parking events happen at curbsides and have significant
impact on the bike users. The detection result can guide the patrol schedule,
i.e. send the patrol policemen to the region with higher illegal parking risks,
and further improve the patrol efficiency. Inspired by this idea, three main
components are employed in the proposed framework: 1)~{\em trajectory
pre-processing}, which filters outlier GPS points, performs map-matching, and
builds trajectory indexes; 2)~{\em illegal parking detection}, which models the
normal trajectories, extracts features from the evaluation trajectories, and
utilizes a distribution test-based method to discover the illegal parking
events; and 3)~{\em patrol scheduling}, which leverages the detection result as
reference context, and models the scheduling task as a multi-agent
reinforcement learning problem to guide the patrol police. Finally, extensive
experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of illegal parking
detection, as well as the improvement of patrol efficiency.

  Signals",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deepfake poses a serious threat to the reliability of judicial evidence and
intellectual property protection. In spite of an urgent need for Deepfake
identification, existing pixel-level detection methods are increasingly unable
to resist the growing realism of fake videos and lack generalization. In this
paper, we propose a scheme to expose Deepfake through faint signals hidden in
face videos. This scheme extracts two types of minute information hidden
between face pixels-photoplethysmography (PPG) features and auto-regressive
(AR) features, which are used as the basis for forensics in the temporal and
spatial domains, respectively. According to the principle of PPG, tracking the
absorption of light by blood cells allows remote estimation of the temporal
domains heart rate (HR) of face video, and irregular HR fluctuations can be
seen as traces of tampering. On the other hand, AR coefficients are able to
reflect the inter-pixel correlation, and can also reflect the traces of
smoothing caused by up-sampling in the process of generating fake faces.
Furthermore, the scheme combines asymmetric convolution block (ACBlock)-based
improved densely connected networks (DenseNets) to achieve face video
authenticity forensics. Its asymmetric convolutional structure enhances the
robustness of network to the input feature image upside-down and left-right
flipping, so that the sequence of feature stitching does not affect detection
results. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme provides more
accurate authenticity detection results on multiple deep forgery datasets and
has better generalization compared to the benchmark strategy.

inverse problem due to low-count projection data, and a robust algorithm is
urgently required to improve imaging quality. Recently, the deep image prior
(DIP) has drawn much attention and has been successfully applied in several
image restoration tasks, such as denoising and inpainting, since it does not
need any labels (reference image). However, overfitting is a vital defect of
this framework. Hence, many methods have been proposed to mitigate this
problem, and DeepRED is a typical representation that combines DIP and
regularization by denoising (RED). In this article, we leverage DeepRED from a
Bayesian perspective to reconstruct PET images from a single corrupted sinogram
without any supervised or auxiliary information. In contrast to the
conventional denoisers customarily used in RED, a DnCNN-like denoiser, which
can add an adaptive constraint to DIP and facilitate the computation of
derivation, is employed. Moreover, to further enhance the regularization,
Gaussian noise is injected into the gradient updates, deriving a Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. Experimental studies on brain and whole-body
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve better performance in
terms of qualitative and quantitative results compared to several classic and

consists of a token transformation module (TTM) that facilities the
transformation of the features extracted from a source viewpoint image into an
intrinsic representation with respect to a pre-defined reference pose and a
view generation module (VGM) that synthesizes an arbitrary view from the

is able to produce comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods despite
the fact that learning is unsupervised and only a single source viewpoint image
is required for generating a novel view. The code will be available soon.

Milky Way by making use of a Gaussian Mixture model (GMM) and applying it to
halo star samples of LAMOST K giants, SEGUE K giants, and SDSS blue horizontal
branch stars. The GMM divides the stellar halo into two parts, of which one
represents a more metal-rich and highly radially biased component associated
with an ancient, head-on collision referred to as the Gaia-Sausage, and the
other one is a more metal-poor and isotropic halo. A symmetric bimodal Gaussian
is used to describe the distribution of spherical velocity of the Gaia-Sausage,
and we find that the mean absolute radial velocity of the two lobes decreases
with Galactocentric radius. We find that the Gaia-Sausage contributes about
$41\%-74\%$ of the inner (Galactocentric radius $r_\mathrm{gc} < 30$ kpc)

beyond $r_\mathrm{gc} \sim$ $25-30$ kpc, and the outer halo is found to be
significantly less influenced by the Gaia-Sausage than the inner halo. After
the removal of halo substructures found by integrals of motion, the
contribution of the \textit{Gaia}-Sausage falls slightly within $r_\mathrm{gc}
\sim$ 25 kpc, but is still as high as $30\%-63\%$. Finally, we select several
possible Sausage-related substructures consisting of stars on highly eccentric
orbits. The GMM/Sausage component agrees well with the selected substructure
stars in their chemodynamical properties, which increases our confidence in the

make the following four contributions. First, we show that the preferability of
optimization methods depends critically on whether stochastic versus exact
gradients are used. In particular, unlike the true gradient setting, geometric
information cannot be easily exploited in the stochastic case for accelerating
policy optimization without detrimental consequences or impractical
assumptions. Second, to explain these findings we introduce the concept of
committal rate for stochastic policy optimization, and show that this can serve
as a criterion for determining almost sure convergence to global optimality.
Third, we show that in the absence of external oracle information, which allows
an algorithm to determine the difference between optimal and sub-optimal
actions given only on-policy samples, there is an inherent trade-off between
exploiting geometry to accelerate convergence versus achieving optimality
almost surely. That is, an uninformed algorithm either converges to a globally
optimal policy with probability $1$ but at a rate no better than $O(1/t)$, or
it achieves faster than $O(1/t)$ convergence but then must fail to converge to
the globally optimal policy with some positive probability. Finally, we use the
committal rate theory to explain why practical policy optimization methods are
sensitive to random initialization, then develop an ensemble method that can be
guaranteed to achieve near-optimal solutions with high probability.

distributions (called \emph{arms}), one of which is treated as a
\emph{control}. We assume that the population is stratified into homogeneous
subpopulations. At every time step, a subpopulation is sampled and an arm is
chosen: the resulting observation is an independent draw from the arm
conditioned on the subpopulation. The quality of each arm is assessed through a
weighted combination of its subpopulation means. We propose a strategy for
sequentially choosing one arm per time step so as to discover as fast as
possible which arms, if any, have higher weighted expectation than the control.
This strategy is shown to be asymptotically optimal in the following sense: if
$\tau_\delta$ is the first time when the strategy ensures that it is able to
output the correct answer with probability at least $1-\delta$, then
$\mathbb{E}[\tau_\delta]$ grows linearly with $\log(1/\delta)$ at the exact
optimal rate. This rate is identified in the paper in three different settings:
(1) when the experimenter does not observe the subpopulation information, (2)
when the subpopulation of each sample is observed but not chosen, and (3) when
the experimenter can select the subpopulation from which each response is
sampled. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy with numerical
simulations on synthetic and real data collected from an A/B/n experiment.

presence of magnetic field for type II superconductors is the introduction of
defects that acts as artificial pinning centres (APCs) for the vortices. For
instance, the in-field critical current density of doped BaFe2As2 (Ba122), one
of the most technologically important Fe-based superconductors, has been
improved over the last decade by APCs created by ion-irradiation. The technique
of ion-irradiation has been commonly implemented to determine the ultimate
superconducting properties. However, this method is rather complicated and
expensive. Here, we report on a surprisingly high critical current density and
strong pinning efficiency close to the crystallographic c-axis for a K-doped
Ba122 epitaxial thin film without APCs, achieving performance comparable to
ion-irradiated K-doped Ba122 single crystals. Microstructural analysis reveals
that the film is composed of columnar grains having width around 30-60 nm. The
grains are rotated around the b- (or a-) axis by 1.5 degree and around the
c-axis by -1 degree, resulting in the formation of low-angle grain boundary
networks. This study demonstrates that the upper limit of in-field properties
reached in ion-irradiated K-doped Ba122 is achievable by grain boundary
engineering, which is a simple and industrially scalable manner.

two-output separator processes a single-speaker recording. Many modifications
to the plain SDR have been proposed that trade-off between making the loss more
robust and distorting its value. We propose to switch from a mean over the SDRs
of each individual output channel to a global SDR over all output channels at
the same time, which we call source-aggregated SDR (SA-SDR). This makes the
loss robust against silence and perfect reconstruction as long as at least one
reference signal is not silent. We experimentally show that our proposed SA-SDR
is more stable and preferable over other well-known modifications when
processing meeting-style data that typically contains many silent or
single-speaker regions.

control problem governed by the Stokes equation. The Dirichlet control is
considered in a convex closed subset of the energy space
$\mathbf{H}^1(\Omega).$ Most of the previous works on the Stokes Dirichlet
boundary control problem deals with either tangential control or the case where
the flux of the control is zero. This choice of the control is very particular
and their choice of the formulation leads to the control with limited
regularity. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the Stokes problem with
outflow condition and the control acts on the Dirichlet boundary only hence our
control is more general and it has both the tangential and normal components.
We prove well-posedness and discuss on the regularity of the control problem.
The first-order optimality condition for the control leads to a Signorini
problem. We develop a two-level finite element discretization by using
$\mathbf{P}_1$ elements(on the fine mesh) for the velocity and the control
variable and $P_0$ elements (on the coarse mesh) for the pressure variable. The
standard energy error analysis gives $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\delta}{2}$ order of
convergence when the control is in $\mathbf{H}^{\frac{3}{2}+\delta}(\Omega)$
space. Here we have improved it to $\frac{1}{2}+\delta,$ which is optimal.
Also, when the control lies in less regular space we derived optimal order of
convergence up to the regularity. The theoretical results are corroborated by a
variety of numerical tests.

  systems: theoretical foundations",,,,,"stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distinguishing between cause and effect using time series observational data
is a major challenge in many scientific fields. A new perspective has been
provided based on the principle of Independence of Causal Mechanisms (ICM),
leading to the Spectral Independence Criterion (SIC), postulating that the
power spectral density (PSD) of the cause time series is uncorrelated with the
squared modulus of the frequency response of the filter generating the effect.
Since SIC rests on methods and assumptions in stark contrast with most causal
discovery methods for time series, it raises questions regarding what
theoretical grounds justify its use. In this paper, we provide answers covering
several key aspects. After providing an information theoretic interpretation of
SIC, we present an identifiability result that sheds light on the context for
which this approach is expected to perform well. We further demonstrate the
robustness of SIC to downsampling - an obstacle that can spoil Granger-based
inference. Finally, an invariance perspective allows to explore the limitations
of the spectral independence assumption and how to generalize it. Overall,
these results support the postulate of Spectral Independence is a well grounded
leading principle for causal inference based on empirical time series.

is necessary to study the dynamics induced by gradient methods from a random
initialization. However, the nonlinear and compositional structure of these
models make these dynamics difficult to analyze. To overcome these challenges,
large-width asymptotics have recently emerged as a fruitful viewpoint and led
to practical insights on real-world deep networks. For two-layer neural
networks, it has been understood via these asymptotics that the nature of the
trained model radically changes depending on the scale of the initial random
weights, ranging from a kernel regime (for large initial variance) to a feature
learning regime (for small initial variance). For deeper networks more regimes
are possible, and in this paper we study in detail a specific choice of
''small'' initialization corresponding to ""mean-field"" limits of neural
networks, which we call integrable parameterizations (IPs). First, we show that
under standard i.i.d. zero-mean initialization, integrable parameterizations of
neural networks with more than four layers start at a stationary point in the
infinite-width limit and no learning occurs. We then propose various methods to
avoid this trivial behavior and analyze in detail the resulting dynamics. In
particular, one of these methods consists in using large initial learning
rates, and we show that it is equivalent to a modification of the recently
proposed maximal update parameterization $\mu$P. We confirm our results with
numerical experiments on image classification tasks, which additionally show a
strong difference in behavior between various choices of activation functions

oscillators, in which each oscillator corresponds to a dynamical system with
many degrees of freedom that have collective oscillations. One of the most
practical methods for investigating the synchronization properties of such a
rhythmic system is to statistically extract phase coupling functions between
limit-cycle oscillators directly from observed time-series data. In Particular,
using a method that combines phase reduction theory and Bayesian inference, the
phase coupling functions can be extracted from the time-series data of even
just one variable in each oscillatory dynamical system with many degrees of
freedom. However, it remains unclear how the choice of the observed variables
affects the statistical inference for the phase coupling functions. In this
study, we examine the influence of observed variable types on the extraction of
phase coupling functions using some typical dynamical elements under various
conditions. We demonstrate that our method can consistently extract the
macroscopic phase coupling functions between two phases representing collective
oscillations in a fully locked state, regardless of the observed variable
types; for example, even using one variable of any element in one system and
the mean-field value over all the elements in another system. We also study the
case of globally coupled phase oscillators in a partially locked state. Our
results reveal directional asymmetry in the robustness of extracting the
macroscopic phase coupling function between two networks. For instance, when an
asynchronous oscillator in network $A$ and the macroscopic collective
oscillation of network $B$ is observed, the macroscopic phase coupling function
from network $A$ to network $B$ can be extracted more robustly than in the
opposite direction.

flat shape up to $m_\bullet\approx 50\, M_\odot$ and then a log-normal decline
for larger masses, while its overall normalization at a given mass increases
with decreasing redshift. We highlight the contribution to the local mass
function from isolated stars evolving into BHs and from binary stellar systems
ending up in single or binary BHs. We also include the distortion on the mass
function induced by binary BH mergers, finding that it has a minor effect at
the high-mass end. We estimate a local stellar BH relic mass density of
$\rho_\bullet\approx 5\times 10^7\, M_\odot$ Mpc$^{-3}$, which exceeds by more
than two orders of magnitude that in supermassive BHs; this translates into an
energy density parameter $\Omega_\bullet\approx 4\times 10^{-4}$, implying that
the total mass in stellar BHs amounts to $\lesssim 1\%$ of the local baryonic

expert knowledge to learn local spatial-temporal relations. However, the

expert knowledge and empirical feedback, which may not be able to effectively

in their inability to distinguish videos with the same visual components but

and $\mu_q$. At $T=(0, 80, 113, 120)$~MeV, the $\langle\pi\rangle$ keeps zero
when $\mu_I$ is less than a critical value $\mu_{Ic}(T)$. The
$\langle\pi\rangle$ at $T=113$~MeV agrees with the lattice QCD result. At the
$T-\mu_I$ plane, the pion superfluid phase appears at low temperature and high
isospin chemical potential region. At finite $\mu_q$, $\langle\pi\rangle$
varying with $\mu_I$ almost coincide for $\mu_q<400$~MeV. At $\mu_q-\mu_I$
plane, the pion superfluid phase appears at $\mu_I\gtrsim m_\pi$ when
$\mu_q<400$~MeV.

vulnerable to adversarial patches which introduce perceptible but localized
changes to the input. Nevertheless, existing approaches have focused on
generating adversarial patches on images, their counterparts in videos have
been less explored. Compared with images, attacking videos is much more
challenging as it needs to consider not only spatial cues but also temporal
cues. To close this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial attack in this paper,
the bullet-screen comment (BSC) attack, which attacks video recognition models
with BSCs. Specifically, adversarial BSCs are generated with a Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework, where the environment is set as the target model and
the agent plays the role of selecting the position and transparency of each
BSC. By continuously querying the target models and receiving feedback, the
agent gradually adjusts its selection strategies in order to achieve a high
fooling rate with non-overlapping BSCs. As BSCs can be regarded as a kind of
meaningful patch, adding it to a clean video will not affect people' s
understanding of the video content, nor will arouse people' s suspicion. We
conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method. On both UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, our BSC attack method can achieve
about 90\% fooling rate when attacking three mainstream video recognition
models, while only occluding \textless 8\% areas in the video. Our code is

suspensions as spontaneously evolving, spatiotemporally chaotic fluids. In
contrast, I show that bulk active fluids have stable active nematic and polar
states at fluid-fluid or fluid-air interfaces. The active flow-mediated
long-range interactions that destroy the ordered phase in bulk, lead to
long-range order at the interface. The active fluids have a surface ordering
transition and form states with quiescent, ordered surfaces and a chaotic bulk.
I further consider active units that are constrained to live at an interface to
examine the minimal conditions for the existence of two-dimensional order in
bulk three-dimensional fluids. In this case, immotile units do not order, but
motile particles still form a long-range-ordered polar phase. This prediction
of stable, uniaxial, active phases in bulk fluids may have functional
consequences for active transport.

framework in training 2D convolutional neural networks. The framework can use
the depth modality to improve accuracy during training and save costs by using
only RGB modality during inference. Our framework is trained to learn a
representation for multi-task learning: gesture segmentation and gesture
recognition. Depth modality contains the prior information for the location of
the gesture. Therefore it can be used as the supervision for gesture
segmentation. A plug-and-play module named Multi-Scale-Decoder is designed to
realize gesture segmentation, which contains two sub-decoder. It is used in the
lower stage and higher stage respectively, and can help the network pay
attention to key target areas, ignore irrelevant information, and extract more
discriminant features. Additionally, the MSD module and depth modality are only
used in the training stage to improve gesture recognition performance. Only RGB
modality and network without MSD are required during inference. Experimental
results on three public gesture recognition datasets show that our proposed

antimicrobial resistance is the separation of bacteria from their matrix. Many
recent studies have been focused on the development of systems capable of
separating and capturing bacteria from different liquid environments. Herein,
we introduce a new approach to this issue by using the natural bacteria
tendency to accumulate at naturally-occurring interfaces, such as liquid-gas
and liquid-solid interfaces, where also organic molecules like lipids,
proteins, and polysaccharides accumulate. This bacterial behavior leads to the
formation of a superficial layer close to the interface rich in bacteria, from
which it is possible to capture a consistent amount of bacteria by means of
surfaces with high chemical affinity to the outer bacteria surface. This paper
demonstrates how to capture bacteria from contaminated urine samples, by means
of commercial microscope slides coated with positively charged biomolecules ,
without recurring to bacterial culture. Moreover, this approach is an easy,
quick and economical method to concentrate living bacteria in a well-defined
position onto a microscope slide, thus making them easily available for further
diagnostic investigations.

gravitational waves produced by compact binaries in the inspiral phase. The
correction is up to the next to leading order, the so-called first
post-Newtonian order (1PN), which are correctional terms proportional to
$(v/c)^2$ compared to leading order, Newtonian, terms. These corrections are
well known in the literature, even going beyond the first order corrections, so
why is it computed again here? In later years, an alternative approach for
computing these terms using effective field theory has emerged. This thesis
investigates this approach by replicating it, and attempts to make this
approach more accessible to those not familiar with effective field theories.
It has been claimed that this approach greatly simplifies the complicated
calculations of gravitational waveforms, and even provides the required
intuition for 'physical understanding'. By this master student that was found
not to be entirely correct. The calculations were made easier for those with a
rich background in quantum field theory, but for those who are not well
acquainted with quantum field theory this was not the case. It was, however,
found to be a worthwhile method as a means for deepening one's understanding of
gravity, and might provide a shorter route for some alternative theories of
gravity to testable predictions.

computer vision tasks. However, the high cost of inference is problematic for
embedded and real-time systems, so there are many studies on compressing the
networks. On the other hand, recent advances in self-attention models showed
that convolution filters are preferable to self-attention in the earlier
layers, which indicates that stronger inductive biases are better in the
earlier layers. As shown in convolutional filters, strong biases can train
specific filters and construct unnecessarily filters to zero. This is analogous
to classical image processing tasks, where choosing the suitable filters makes
a compact dictionary to represent features. We follow this idea and incorporate
Gabor filters in the earlier layers of CNNs for compression. The parameters of
Gabor filters are learned through backpropagation, so the features are
restricted to Gabor filters. We show that the first layer of VGG-16 for
CIFAR-10 has 192 kernels/features, but learning Gabor filters requires an
average of 29.4 kernels. Also, using Gabor filters, an average of 83% and 94%
of kernels in the first and the second layer, respectively, can be removed on
the altered ResNet-20, where the first five layers are exchanged with two
layers of larger kernels for CIFAR-10.

to type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This is because X-ray photons
originally emitted from the `corona' close to the black hole irradiate the
accretion disc and are re-emitted with a characteristic `reflection' spectrum
that includes a prominent $\sim 6.4$ keV iron emission line. The shape of the
reflection spectrum depends on the irradiating flux, and the light-crossing
delay between continuum photons observed directly from the corona and the
reflected photons constrains the size of the disc. Simultaneously modelling the
X-ray spectrum and the time delays between photons of different energies
therefore constrains the intrinsic reflected luminosity, and the distance
follows from the observed reflected flux. Alternatively, the distance can be
measured from the X-ray spectrum alone if the black hole mass is known. We
develop a new model of our RELTRANS X-ray reverberation mapping package, called
RTDIST, that has distance as a model parameter. We simulate a synthetic
observation that we fit with our new model, and find that this technique
applied to a sample of $\sim 25$ AGNs can be used to measure the Hubble
constant with a $3 \sigma$ statistical uncertainty of $\sim 6~{\rm km}~{\rm
s}^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Since the technique is completely independent of the
traditional distance ladder and the cosmic microwave background radiation, it
has the potential to address the current tension between them. We discuss
sources of modelling uncertainty, and how they can be addressed in the near
future.

form of its quantum kinetic equation for weak system-environment coupling. This
encompasses the well-known Kramers equation of conventional Brownian motion as
a particular instance. The influence of the underlying chiral symmetry is
essentially twofold: the anomalous diffusive tensor picks up antisymmtretic
components, and the drift term has an additional contribution which plays the
role of an environmental torque acting upon the system particles. These yield
an unconventional fluid dynamics that is absent in the standard

effects manifest as vorticity sources in the Kelvin's circulation equation.
Conversely, the energy kinetic density remains unchanged and the usual Boyle's

achieved great progress due to the development of deep learning technology.
However, the continuous-scale SR, which aims to use a single model to process
arbitrary (integer or non-integer) scale factors, is still a challenging task.
The existing SR models generally adopt static convolution to extract features,
and thus unable to effectively perceive the change of scale factor, resulting
in limited generalization performance on multi-scale SR tasks. Moreover, the
existing continuous-scale upsampling modules do not make full use of
multi-scale features and face problems such as checkerboard artifacts in the SR
results and high computational complexity. To address the above problems, we
propose a scale-aware dynamic network (SADN) for continuous-scale SR. First, we
propose a scale-aware dynamic convolutional (SAD-Conv) layer for the feature
learning of multiple SR tasks with various scales. The SAD-Conv layer can
adaptively adjust the attention weights of multiple convolution kernels based
on the scale factor, which enhances the expressive power of the model with a
negligible extra computational cost. Second, we devise a continuous-scale
upsampling module (CSUM) with the multi-bilinear local implicit function
(MBLIF) for any-scale upsampling. The CSUM constructs multiple feature spaces
with gradually increasing scales to approximate the continuous feature
representation of an image, and then the MBLIF makes full use of multi-scale
features to map arbitrary coordinates to RGB values in high-resolution space.
We evaluate our SADN using various benchmarks. The experimental results show
that the CSUM can replace the previous fixed-scale upsampling layers and obtain
a continuous-scale SR network while maintaining performance. Our SADN uses much
fewer parameters and outperforms the state-of-the-art SR methods.

overcomes the issues that standard techniques (such as scalarization or

We put forward a greedy-strategy to assemble such small-dimensional basis,

Once the RBM is assembled, physical observables required for mapping out the
phase-diagram (e.g., structure factors) can be computed for any parameter value

in two test cases, a chain of excited Rydberg atoms and a geometrically
frustrated antiferromagnetic two-dimensional lattice model, and illustrate the

be approximated to sufficient accuracy with a moderate number of basis
functions, which increases very mildly when the number of microscopic
constituents grows - in stark contrast to the exponential growth of the Hilbert

may push even supercomputers to their limits. Quantum image processing promises
to encode images with logarithmically less qubits than classical pixels in the
image. In theory, this is a huge progress, but so far not many experiments have
been conducted in practice, in particular on real backends. Often, the precise
conversion of classical data to quantum states, the exact implementation, and
the interpretation of the measurements in the classical context are
challenging. We investigate these practical questions in this paper. In

3D-aware image synthesis. Motivated by the observation that a 3D object should
look realistic from multiple viewpoints, these methods introduce a multi-view
constraint as regularization to learn valid 3D radiance fields from 2D images.
Despite the progress, they often fall short of capturing accurate 3D shapes due
to the shape-color ambiguity, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks.
In this work, we address this ambiguity by proposing a novel shading-guided
generative implicit model that is able to learn a starkly improved shape
representation. Our key insight is that an accurate 3D shape should also yield
a realistic rendering under different lighting conditions. This multi-lighting
constraint is realized by modeling illumination explicitly and performing
shading with various lighting conditions. Gradients are derived by feeding the
synthesized images to a discriminator. To compensate for the additional
computational burden of calculating surface normals, we further devise an
efficient volume rendering strategy via surface tracking, reducing the training
and inference time by 24% and 48%, respectively. Our experiments on multiple
datasets show that the proposed approach achieves photorealistic 3D-aware image
synthesis while capturing accurate underlying 3D shapes. We demonstrate
improved performance of our approach on 3D shape reconstruction against
existing methods, and show its applicability on image relighting. Our code will

contribution of zero-point energies. We model this contribution via the
renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a massless scalar field, which we
compute in a cutoff-regularized version of the Polyakov approximation. When the
field is in the Boulware vacuum state (the natural vacuum for stellar
geometries), the RSET works in favor of violating the Buchdahl compactness
limit. We review the family of classical constant-density stellar solutions,
paying particular attention to the notion of criticality -- the presence of
offsets in the mass function -- and use it as a warm up for the analysis of the
semiclassical set of solutions. For stars that surpass Buchdahl limit by far,
the critical solution has an irregular pressure. This divergence in pressure
moves inward by introducing a negative offset in the mass. In the semiclassical
theory we find something rather different, namely that the critical
configuration already displays a pressure that diverges exactly at the center
of the structure. This drastic difference between the classical and
semiclassical space of solutions suggests that semiclassical gravity could
potentially allow for the existence of ultracompact stellar objects.

information and direct user attention towards items deemed most relevant to
them. Due to position bias, items of similar relevance may receive
significantly different exposure, raising fairness concerns for item providers
and motivating recent research into fair ranking. While the area has progressed
dramatically over recent years, no study to date has investigated the potential
problem posed by duplicated items. Duplicates and near-duplicates are common in
several domains, including marketplaces and document collections available to
search engines. In this work, we study the behaviour of different fair ranking
policies in the presence of duplicates, quantifying the extra-exposure gained
by redundant items. We find that fairness-aware ranking policies may conflict
with diversity, due to their potential to incentivize duplication more than
policies solely focused on relevance. This fact poses a problem for system
owners who, as a result of this incentive, may have to deal with increased
redundancy, which is at odds with user satisfaction. Finally, we argue that
this aspect represents a blind spot in the normative reasoning underlying
common fair ranking metrics, as rewarding providers who duplicate their items
with increased exposure seems unfair for the remaining providers.

topic discussed in this thesis are at the crossroad of Differential Topology
and Random Geometry. The common thread of these works is the study of
topological and geometric properties of random smooth maps. The first chapter
contains the motivations and the main results of the thesis. In particular it
describes how these works are related as parts of a general method to study
topological properties of smooth random maps. In the second chapter a general
framework to deal with issues of differential geometric and topological nature
regarding smooth Gaussian Random Fields is developed. The main results in this
context are: a characterization of the convergence in law in terms of the
covariance functions and a probabilistic version of Thom's jet transversality
theorem. The third chapter is devoted to a generalization of the famous
Kac-Rice formula. The formula presented here calculates the expected number of
points at which a smooth random map meets a given (deterministic) submanifold
of the codomain, whereas the standard formula deals with preimages of a point.
In the fourth chapter all the previous methods are applied to Kostlan random
polynomials. The fifth and last chapter of the thesis is devoted to present and
prove an original theorem of Differential Topology. It says that the Betti
numbers of the solution of a system of regular equations cannot decrease under
a $\mathcal{C}^0$-small perturbation of the equations.

living beings transfer emotions is limited. In particular, there are highly
sophisticated interactions between human beings that we would like to
comprehend. For instance, think of a movie director who knows in advance the
strong emotional impact that a certain scene will have on the spectators.
Although many artists rely on some emotional devices, their talent and vision
are still the key factors.
  In this work we analyze high-level protocols for transferring emotions
between two intelligent agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to use communication protocols for modeling the exchange of human
emotions. By means of a number of examples, we show that our protocols
adequately model the engagement of the two parties. Beyond the theoretical

to be embeddable in the Minimal (Lepton) Flavour Violating context, providing a
correct description of fermion masses and mixings, and protecting the flavour
sector from large deviations from the Standard Model predictions. A QCD axion

linearly decomposing rewards into successor features and a reward weight vector
allowing their application in high-dimensional tasks. But this came with the
cost of having a linear relationship between reward functions and successor

SFR allows to reevaluate the expected return of policies for general reward

One of the primary intentions behind introducing the fog environment is to
fulfil the demand of latency and location-sensitive serverless applications

maximum resources to such applications from the fog node and not taking full

these constraints may model walls, columns, fences, hedges, or other kinds of
obstacles at the boundary of the domain which agents cannot cross. After

""[Computational] models which process approximate inputs and which permit
round-off computations"". Indeed, since e.g. the exponential function does not
have an exact representation or floating-point arithmetic approximates every
rational number that is not in base-2, inexact input is a daily encounter. The
model allowing inaccurate input of arbitrary precision, which we call the
extended model, leads to extended versions of fundamental problems such as:
""Are LP and other aforementioned problems in P?"" The same question can be asked
for an extended version of Smale's 9th problem on the list of mathematical
problems for the 21st century: ""Is there a polynomial time algorithm over the
real numbers which decides the feasibility of the linear system of
inequalities, and if so, outputs a feasible candidate?"" One can thus pose this
problem in the extended model. Similarly, the optimisation problems BP, SDP and
Lasso, where the task is to output a solution to a specified precision, can
likewise be posed in the extended model, also considering randomised
algorithms. We will collectively refer to these problems as the extended
Smale's 9th problem, which we settle in both the negative and the positive
yielding two surprises: (1) In mathematics, sparse regularisation, statistics,

complexity theory for, seemingly paradoxically, non-computable functions.

versatile method of Ref. \cite{burton20a} by formulating a perturbative
expansion on top of a multi-reference unperturbed state mixing deformed
non-orthogonal Bogoliubov vacua, i.e. a state obtained from the projected
generator coordinate method (PGCM). Particular attention is paid to the part of
the mixing taking care of the symmetry restoration, showing that it can be
exactly contracted throughout the expansion, thus reducing significantly the
dimensionality of the linear problem to be solved to extract perturbative
corrections.
  While the novel expansion method, coined as PGCM-PT, reduces to the PGCM at
lowest order, it reduces to single-reference perturbation theories in
appropriate limits. Based on a PGCM unperturbed state capturing (strong) static
correlations in a versatile and efficient fashion, PGCM-PT is indistinctly
applicable to doubly closed-shell, singly open-shell and doubly open-shell
nuclei. The remaining (weak) dynamical correlations are brought consistently
through perturbative corrections. This symmetry-conserving multi-reference
perturbation theory is state-specific and applies to both ground and excited
PGCM unperturbed states, thus correcting each state belonging to the low-lying
spectrum of the system under study.

bottlenecks change their location in time and space. This means that to plan
and manage traffic jams in different locations and at different times, it is
required to implement a framework, as developed here, that tracks traffic and
evaluates the relative effect of each evolving bottleneck on the entire road
network.

used for information transmission are stored, released, and then replenished by
a transmitter (TX). However, the replenishment of signaling molecules at the TX
is challenging in practice. Furthermore, in most envisioned MC applications,
e.g., in the medical field, it is not desirable to insert the TX into the MC
system, as this might impair natural biological processes. In this paper, we
propose the concept of media modulation based MC where the TX is placed outside
the channel and utilizes signaling molecules already existing inside the
system. We consider signaling molecules that can be in different states which
can be switched by external stimuli. Hence, in media modulation based MC, for
information transmission, the TX stimulates the signaling molecules to encode
information into their state. In particular, we elaborate media modulation for
the group of photochromic molecules, which undergo light-induced reversible
transformations, and study the usage of these molecules for information
transmission in a three-dimensional duct system. We develop a statistical model
for the received signal which depends on the distribution of the signaling
molecules in the system, the reliability of the state control mechanism, and
the randomness of molecule propagation. Furthermore, we analyze the performance
of media modulation based MC in terms of the bit error rate (BER). We show that
media modulation enables reliable information transmission, which renders a TX
inside the channel unnecessary.

solar flare observed at 30~THz (10$\ \mu$m) by the ground-based telescope
AR30T. Our aim is to characterize the evolution of the flaring atmosphere and
the energy transport mechanism in the context of mid-IR emission. We performed
a multi-wavelength analysis of the event by complementing the mid-IR data with
diverse ground- and space-based data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO),
the H--$\alpha$ Solar Telescope for Argentina (HASTA), and the Expanded Owens
Valley Solar Array (EOVSA). Our study includes the analysis of the magnetic
field evolution of the flaring region and of the development of the flare. The
mid-IR images from AR30T show two bright and compact flare sources that are
spatially associated with the flare kernels observed in ultraviolet (UV) by
SDO. We confirm that the temporal association between mid-IR and UV fluxes
previously reported for strong flares is also observed for this small flare.
The EOVSA microwave data revealed flare spectra consistent with thermal
free-free emission, which lead us to dismiss the existence of a significant
number of non-thermal electrons. We thus consider thermal conduction as the
primary mechanism responsible for energy transport. Our estimates for the
thermal conduction energy and total radiated energy fall within the same order
of magnitude, reinforcing our conclusions.

a rectification efficiency as large as 60%, considerably larger than the

theory for superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, we show that the
effect is driven by an out-of-plane magnetic field component. Remarkably, we
find that the effect becomes field-asymmetric in the presence of an additional
in-plane field component transverse to the current direction. Supercurrent

function, and used a forward modelling approach to detect the companions and
constrain the chemical composition of their atmospheres through their molecular
signatures. We identified limiting factors in spectroscopic characterisation of
directly imaged exoplanets with the MRS and simulated observations of two
representative systems, HR8799 and GJ504. In both systems, we could detect the
presence of multiple molecules that were present in the input model of their
atmospheres. We used two different approaches with single molecule forward
models, used in literature, that are sensitive to detecting mainly H$_2$O, CO,
CH$_4$, and NH$_3$, and a log-likelihood ratio test that uses full atmosphere
forward models and is sensitive to a larger number of less dominant molecular

are different for a weak and a strong inter-dot coupling with respect to the
dot-electrode coupling. When the dot-dot coupling is weak, we find that
transport dynamics is governed by two channel tunneling processes with two
different relaxation times and buildup of the Fano resonance is developed much
slower, with the longer relaxation time. In the opposite limit, the
transmission evolves with a single relaxation time, from the single peak
resonance structure into the structure with two asymmetric peaks. One observes
large dot-electrode charge oscillations, which can temporarily change direction
of transient currents. We find also that the time evolution of entanglement is
different in both coupling regimes; in particular rapid Rabi oscillations
caused by coherent electron transfer between the 2QD states can be seen for the
strong dot-dot coupling.

a lower bound that accounts for uncertainty in both the estimates of the
warping process and the underlying functions. Also, our new take on a monotonic
stochastic process, with efficient path-wise sampling for the warp functions,
allows us to perform full Bayesian inference in the model rather than MAP

demonstrate the advantages of accounting for misalignments (vs standard
unaligned method) as well as modelling the uncertainty in the warping

With the growing data in the healthcare domain, it offers a great opportunity
for deep learning to improve the quality of medical service. However, the
complexity of electronic health records (EHR) data is a challenge for the
application of deep learning. Specifically, the data produced in the hospital
admissions are monitored by the EHR system, which includes structured data like
daily body temperature, and unstructured data like free text and laboratory

specific EHR data, the clinical notes that contain significant clinical value
are beyond the realm of their consideration. Besides, whether these different

utilize these data remain unclear. Therefore, in this paper, we first extract
the accompanying clinical notes from EHR and propose a method to integrate

pre-trained Transformer networks. However, these models often contain hundreds
of millions or even billions of parameters, bringing challenges to online
deployment due to latency constraints. Recently, hardware manufacturers have
introduced dedicated hardware for NxM sparsity to provide the flexibility of
unstructured pruning with the runtime efficiency of structured approaches. NxM
sparsity permits arbitrarily selecting M parameters to retain from a contiguous
group of N in the dense representation. However, due to the extremely high
complexity of pre-trained models, the standard sparse fine-tuning techniques
often fail to generalize well on downstream tasks, which have limited data
resources. To address such an issue in a principled manner, we introduce a new
learning framework, called NxMTransformer, to induce NxM semi-structured
sparsity on pretrained language models for natural language understanding to
obtain better performance. In particular, we propose to formulate the NxM
sparsity as a constrained optimization problem and use Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to optimize the downstream tasks while taking the
underlying hardware constraints into consideration. ADMM decomposes the NxM
sparsification problem into two sub-problems that can be solved sequentially,
generating sparsified Transformer networks that achieve high accuracy while
being able to effectively execute on newly released hardware. We apply our
approach to a wide range of NLP tasks, and our proposed method is able to
achieve 1.7 points higher accuracy in GLUE score than current practices.
Moreover, we perform detailed analysis on our approach and shed light on how
ADMM affects fine-tuning accuracy for downstream tasks. Finally, we illustrate
how NxMTransformer achieves performance improvement with knowledge

practice, state-of-the-art methods are increasingly application-dependent,
heuristic in nature, and suffer from fundamental trade-offs between nominal
performance and robustness. Moreover, the problem of finding worst-case
perturbations is non-convex and underparameterized, both of which engender a
non-favorable optimization landscape. Thus, there is a gap between the theory
and practice of adversarial training, particularly with respect to when and why
adversarial training works. In this paper, we take a constrained learning
approach to address these questions and to provide a theoretical foundation for
robust learning. In particular, we leverage semi-infinite optimization and
non-convex duality theory to show that adversarial training is equivalent to a
statistical problem over perturbation distributions, which we characterize
completely. Notably, we show that a myriad of previous robust training
techniques can be recovered for particular, sub-optimal choices of these

buoyancy for these structures which restricts the size range of particles that
float in the ocean on Enceladus, Pluto and similar oceanic worlds. Our goal
here is to investigate the implications of Lifshitz forces and low occupancy

layer formation, presenting a plausible model based on multilayer interactions
through dispersion forces. We predict that the growth of an ice layer between
0.01 and 0.2 $\mu$m thick on CO2 clathrate surfaces depends on the presence of
surface regions in the gas hydrates with low occupancy. The effective particle
density is estimated delimiting a range of particles that would be buoyant in
different oceans. Over geological time, deposition of floating CO2 hydrates
could result in the accumulation of kilometre-thick hydrate layers above liquid
water reservoirs, and below the water ice crusts of their respective ocean
worlds. On Enceladus, destabilisation of near-surface hydrate deposits could
lead to increased gas pressures that both drive plumes and entrain stabilised
hydrates to be redeposited on the surface of Enceladus or ejected into the
E-ring of Saturn. On ocean worlds such as Enceladus and particularly Pluto, the
accumulation of thick CO2 hydrate deposits could insulate its ocean against
freezing. In preventing the freezing of liquid water reservoirs in ocean

their ability to capture the heterophily property is often doubtful. This is

notion of fairness aims at increasing the utility of the worse-off individuals,

rankings are Pareto efficient, and that they maximally redistribute utility
from better-off to worse-off, at a given level of overall utility. We propose
to generate rankings by maximizing concave welfare functions, and develop an
efficient inference procedure based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. We prove that
unlike existing approaches based on fairness constraints, our approach always
produces fair rankings. Our experiments also show that it increases the utility

explore fascinating fundamental features, such as out-of-equilibrium
Bose-Einstein condensation and quantum fluids of light, as well as novel

experimentally the formation of exciton-polaritons arising from the mixing

In a Continuum (BIC) of a subwavelength-scale metasurface, at room temperature.
These polaritonic eigenmodes, hereby called polariton BICs (pol-BICs) are
revealed in both reflectivity, resonant scattering, and photoluminescence
measurements. Although pol-BICs only exhibit a finite quality factor that is
bounded by the non-radiative losses of the excitonic component, they fully
inherit BIC peculiar features: a full uncoupling from the radiative continuum
in the vertical direction, which is associated to a locally vanishing farfield
radiation in momentum space. Most importantly, our experimental results confirm
that the topological nature of the photonic BIC is perfectly transferred to the
pol-BIC. This is evidenced with the observation of a polarization vortex in the

of encapsulated MoS2 monolayer as a function of the temperature and the power
density with a continuous wave laser excitation. Both valley polarization and
coherence exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on sample temperature, attaining a
local maximum at T=40 K. This has been recently attributed to a motional
narrowing effect: an enhancement of the valley relaxation time occurs when the
scattering rate increases. At a fixed temperature of T=6 K, a two-fold increase
of the steady-state valley polarization is achieved by increasing the laser
excitation power, which we attribute to a local heating induced by the energy
relaxation of photoexcited excitons outside the light cone and to an increase
in the exciton-exciton scattering rate. In contrast, in the same power range
only a moderate enhancement of valley coherence is observed. Further increasing
the excitation power leads to a small reduction of valley polarization but a
dramatic loss of valley coherence. Supported by spatial imaging of the
excitonic luminescence and polarization, we attribute this behaviour to the
detrimental role of exciton-exciton interactions on the pure dephasing rate.

generating process to recover its latent properties. Existing work that
provably achieves this goal relies on strong assumptions on relationships
between the latent variables (e.g., independence conditional on auxiliary
information). In this paper, we take a very different perspective on the
problem and ask, ""Can we instead identify latent properties by leveraging
knowledge of the mechanisms that govern their evolution?"" We provide a complete
characterization of the sources of non-identifiability as we vary knowledge
about a set of possible mechanisms. In particular, we prove that if we know the
exact mechanisms under which the latent properties evolve, then identification
can be achieved up to any equivariances that are shared by the underlying
mechanisms. We generalize this characterization to settings where we only know
some hypothesis class over possible mechanisms, as well as settings where the
mechanisms are stochastic. We demonstrate the power of this mechanism-based
perspective by showing that we can leverage our results to generalize existing
identifiable representation learning results. These results suggest that by
exploiting inductive biases on mechanisms, it is possible to design a range of
new identifiable representation learning approaches.

Finally, both the reconstruction error and the OOD probability predicted by the
binary discriminator are used to determine the anomalies. We compare the
performance with the state-of-the-art deep learning models to demonstrate our
model's efficacy on various open-access medical imaging datasets for both
intra- and inter-class OOD. Further extensive results on datasets including
common natural datasets show our model's effectiveness and generalizability.

time occurences of particular electric signals, called action potential or
spike, to neurons. We rephrase this problem as a particular optimization
problem : Lasso for convolutional models in high dimension. Lasso (i.e. least
absolute shrinkage and selection operator) is a very generic tool in machine
learning that help us to look for sparse solutions (here the time occurrences).
However, for the size of the problem at hand in this neuroscience context, the
classical Lasso solvers are failing. We present here a new and much faster
algorithm. Making use of biological properties related to neurons, we explain
how the particular structure of the problem allows several optimizations,
leading to an algorithm with a temporal complexity which grows linearly with
respect to the size of the recorded signal and can be performed online.
Moreover the spatial separability of the initial problem allows to break it
into subproblems, further reducing the complexity and making possible its
application on the latest recording devices which comprise a large number of
sensors. We provide several mathematical results: the size and numerical
complexity of the subproblems can be estimated mathematically by using
percolation theory. We also show under reasonable assumptions that the Lasso
estimator retrieves the true time occurrences of the spikes {with large
probability}. Finally the theoretical time complexity of the algorithm is
given. Numerical simulations are also provided in order to illustrate the
efficiency of our approach.

the SPM objective function has the desirable properties that its maximal value

the tensor when the input is sufficiently low-rank. We analyze the non-convex
optimization landscape associated with the SPM objective. Our analysis accounts
for working with noisy tensors. We derive quantitative bounds such that any
second-order critical point with SPM objective value exceeding the bound must
equal a tensor component in the noiseless case, and must approximate a tensor
component in the noisy case. For decomposing tensors of size $D^{\times m}$, we
obtain a near-global guarantee up to rank $\widetilde{o}(D^{\lfloor m/2
\rfloor})$ under a random tensor model, and a global guarantee up to rank
$\mathcal{O}(D)$ assuming deterministic frame conditions. This implies that SPM
with suitable initialization is a provable, efficient, robust algorithm for
low-rank symmetric tensor decomposition. We conclude with numerics that show a

experiments have reported the observation of unexplained excesses of events at
low energies. Exemplary for these, the experiment CRESST has detected
unidentified events below an energy of about 200 eV - a result hampering the
detector performance in the search for GeV-scale DM. In this work, we test the
impact of nuclear recoil timing information on the potential for DM signal
discovery and model selection on a low-threshold experiment limited by the
presence of an unidentified background resembling this population of low-energy
events. Among the different targets explored by the CRESST collaboration, here
we focus on Al2O3, as a sapphire detector was shown to reach an energy
threshold as low as 19.7 eV [1]. We test the ability of a low-threshold
experiment to discover a signal above a given background, or to reject the
spin-independent (SI) interaction in favour of a magnetic dipole (MD) coupling
in terms of p-values. We perform our p-value calculations: 1) taking timing
information into account; and 2) assuming that the latter is not available. By
comparing the two approaches, we find that under our assumptions timing
information has a marginal impact on the potential for DM signal discovery,
while provides more significant results for the selection between the two
models considered. For the model parameters explored here, we find that the
p-value for rejecting SI-interactions in favour of a MD-coupling is about 0.11
when the experimental exposure is 460 g x year and smaller (about 0.06) if
timing information is available. The conclusion on the role of timing
information remains qualitatively unchanged for exposures as large as 1 kg x
year. At the same time, our results show that a 90% C.L. rejection of
SI-interactions in favour of a MD-coupling is within reach of an upgrade of the
CRESST experiment [2].

the displacement of ions in the perovskites. In the low temperature
orthorhombic phase, the directional movement of the Cs cations decreases
contact with the surrounding halides, initiating a transition to the
non-perovskite phase. However, this loss of contact can be compensated by
increased halide displacement, once enough thermal energy is available,
resulting in a transition to the tetragonal or cubic phases. Furthermore, we
find the mixing of halides increase halide displacement over a significant
range of temperatures, resulting in lower phase transition temperatures and
therefore improved phase stability.

coupling neighboring support points and their derivative terms which are
obtained by automatic differentiation (AD), are proposed to allow efficient
training with improved accuracy. The computation of differential operators
required for PINNs loss evaluation at collocation points are conventionally
obtained via AD. Although AD has the advantage of being able to compute the
exact gradients at any point, such PINNs can only achieve high accuracies with
large numbers of collocation points, otherwise they are prone to optimizing
towards unphysical solution. To make PINN training fast, the dual ideas of
using numerical differentiation (ND)-inspired method and coupling it with AD
are employed to define the loss function. The ND-based formulation for training
loss can strongly link neighboring collocation points to enable efficient
training in sparse sample regimes, but its accuracy is restricted by the
interpolation scheme. The proposed coupled-automatic-numerical differentiation
framework, labeled as can-PINN, unifies the advantages of AD and ND, providing
more robust and efficient training than AD-based PINNs, while further improving
accuracy by up to 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to ND-based PINNs. For a
proof-of-concept demonstration of this can-scheme to fluid dynamic problems,
two numerical-inspired instantiations of can-PINN schemes for the convection
and pressure gradient terms were derived to solve the incompressible
Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. The superior performance of can-PINNs is
demonstrated on several challenging problems, including the flow mixing
phenomena, lid driven flow in a cavity, and channel flow over a backward facing
step. The results reveal that for challenging problems like these, can-PINNs
can consistently achieve very good accuracy whereas conventional AD-based PINNs
fail.

and a southern subcluster (A1569S) harbouring a wide-angle-tailed (WAT) radio
source 1233+168. X-ray emission from A1569N and A1569S extends to a radius
$r\sim248$ kpc and $r\sim370$ kpc, respectively, indicating that the two gas

of magnitude larger than the X-ray radiative loss in the cavity-occupied

time dimensions obtained from ""magnetic"" and ""electric"" ultrarelativistic
contractions of General Relativity are analyzed. In both cases, parity
conditions are needed to guarantee a finite symplectic term, in analogy with
Einstein gravity. For the magnetic contraction, when Regge-Teitelboim parity
conditions are imposed, the asymptotic symmetries are described by the Carroll
group. With Henneaux-Troessaert parity conditions, the asymptotic symmetry
algebra corresponds to a BMS-like extension of the Carroll algebra. For the
electric contraction, because the lapse function does not appear in the
boundary term needed to ensure a well-defined action principle, the asymptotic
symmetry algebra is truncated, for Regge-Teitelboim parity conditions, to the
semidirect sum of spatial rotations and spatial translations. Similarly, with
Henneaux-Troessaert parity conditions, the asymptotic symmetries are given by
the semidirect sum of spatial rotations and an infinite number of parity odd
supertranslations. Thus, from the point of view of the asymptotic symmetries,
the magnetic contraction can be seen as a smooth limit of General Relativity,
in contrast to its electric counterpart.

problems have been studied extensively in practice on applications ranging from
resource allocation to cache management. Two major questions in designing
discretization-based algorithms are how to create the discretization and when
to refine it. While there have been several experimental results investigating
heuristic solutions to these questions, there has been little theoretical
treatment. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of
tree-based hierarchical partitioning methods for online reinforcement learning,
providing model-free and model-based algorithms. We show how our algorithms are

guarantees that scale with respect to the 'zooming dimension' instead of the
ambient dimension, an instance-dependent quantity measuring the benignness of
the optimal $Q_h^\star$ function.
  Many applications in computing systems and operations research requires
algorithms that compete on three facets: low sample complexity, mild storage
requirements, and low computational burden. Our algorithms are easily adapted
to operating constraints, and our theory provides explicit bounds across each
of the three facets. This motivates its use in practical applications as our
approach automatically adapts to underlying problem structure even when very
little is known a priori about the system.

new endpoints are needed to better measure treatment efficacy in phase II

(GMI), i.e. the ratio between times to progression or progression-free survival
times in two successive treatment lines. An essential task in studies using GMI
as an endpoint is to estimate the distribution of GMI. Traditional methods for
survival data have been used for estimating the GMI distribution because
censoring is common for GMI data. However, we point out that the independent
censoring assumption required by traditional survival methods is always
violated for GMI, which may lead to severely biased results. In this paper, we
construct nonparametric estimators for the distribution of GMI, accounting for
the dependent censoring of GMI. We prove that the proposed estimators are
consistent and converge weakly to zero-mean Gaussian processes upon proper
normalization. Extensive simulation studies show that our estimators perform
well in practical situations and outperform traditional methods. A phase II
clinical trial using GMI as the primary endpoint is provided for illustration.

the CAFE model, which includes spontaneous calving, aggregation, fragmentation,
and mass-exchange, yielding a steady-state size distribution that can be
resolved for different choices of interaction parameters. The CAFE model is
applied to empirically measured distributions of dune sizes in two barchan
swarms in the north circumpolar region of Mars, three swarms in Morocco, and
one in Mauritania, each containing more than 1000 bedforms. When the sizes of
bedforms are rescaled by the mean size in each zone two attractor states
appear, with the Tarfaya zones all displaying a common distribution and the
Martian and Mauritanian zones sharing a different distribution. Comparison of
these attractor states with the outputs of the CAFE model reveals that the
Tarfaya-type distribution results from a preference for aggregation and
fragmentation interactions whereas the Mars-Mauritania distribution is more
likely a result of exchange-dominated interactions. We observe that there
appears to be a greater number of collisions happening in Tarfaya than in the
other areas which is consistent with a greater rate of
aggregation-fragmentation processes as suggested by our model. Our comparison
with the CAFE model also predicts a universal rule for the outputs of the
different types of interactions with exchange interactions favouring the
production of two dunes roughly equal in size. Fragmentation interactions often
result in three bedforms with volumes approximately in the ratio 1:1:2.
Finally, we find that spontaneous calving of dunes does not play an important
role in shaping the size distributions in barchan swarms.

Herein, we develop a versatile, exactly-solvable, one-dimensional off-lattice

shows an excellent quantitative agreement with three-dimensional Monte Carlo
simulations. With analytical calculations and simulations, we show that the
differential capacitance can be bell-shaped (one peak), camel-shaped (two
peaks), or have four peaks. Transformations between these capacitance shapes
can be induced by changing pore ionophilicity, cation-anion size asymmetry, or
by adding solvent. We find that the camel-shaped capacitance, characteristic of
dilute electrolytes, appears for strongly ionophilic pores with high ion
densities, which we relate to charging mechanisms specific to narrow pores. We
also derive a large-voltage asymptotic expression for the capacitance, showing
that the capacitance decays to zero as the inverse square of the voltage, $C
\sim u^{-2}$. This dependence follows from hard-core interactions and is not
captured by the lattice model.

optical signals between waveguides and on-chip circuitry and detectors. While
the ideal OMT-waveguide coupling requires minimal disturbance to the waveguide,
when used for mm-wave applications the waveguide is typically constructed from
two sections to allow the OMT probes to be inserted into the waveguide. This
break in the waveguide is a source of signal leakage and can lead to loss of
performance and increased experimental systematic errors. Here we report on the
development of new OMT-to-waveguide coupling structures with the goal of
reducing leakage at the detector wafer interface. The pixel to pixel optical
leakage due to the gap between the coupling waveguide and the backshort is
reduced by means of a protrusion that passes through the OMT membrane and
electrically connects the two waveguide sections on either side of the wafer.
High frequency electromagnetic simulations indicate that these protrusions are
an effective method to reduce optical leakage in the gap by ~80% percent, with
a ~60% filling factor, relative to an standard OMT coupling architecture.
Prototype devices have been designed to characterize the performance of the new
design using a relative measurement with varying filling factors. We outline
the simulation setup and results, and present a chip layout and sample box that
will be used to perform the initial measurements.

particular importance for North Atlantic heat transport and is thought to be

this parametric uncertainty is important to understand the likelihood of
tipping behavior being present in the system and possible tipping locations. In

inferring probability distributions for the model parameters based on physical

impact of parametric uncertainty, we extend classical tipping diagrams by
visualizing probabilistic bifurcation curves according to the inferred

vacuous bounds on generalization performance of neural networks, risk of

They can, for instance, re-phrase a formal letter in an informal way, convey a
literal message with the use of figures of speech or edit a novel by mimicking
the style of some well-known authors. Automating this form of creativity
constitutes the goal of style transfer. As a natural language generation task,
style transfer aims at rewriting existing texts, and specifically, it creates
paraphrases that exhibit some desired stylistic attributes. From a practical
perspective, it envisions beneficial applications, like chatbots that modulate
their communicative style to appear empathetic, or systems that automatically
simplify technical articles for a non-expert audience. Several style-aware
paraphrasing methods have attempted to tackle style transfer. A handful of
surveys give a methodological overview of the field, but they do not support
researchers to focus on specific styles. With this paper, we aim at providing a
comprehensive discussion of the styles that have received attention in the
transfer task. We organize them in a hierarchy, highlighting the challenges for
the definition of each of them, and pointing out gaps in the current research
landscape. The hierarchy comprises two main groups. One encompasses styles that
people modulate arbitrarily, along the lines of registers and genres. The other
group corresponds to unintentionally expressed styles, due to an author's
personal characteristics. Hence, our review shows how these groups relate to
one another, and where specific styles, including some that have not yet been
explored, belong in the hierarchy. Moreover, we summarize the methods employed
for different stylistic families, hinting researchers towards those that would
be the most fitting for future research.

  Conference (ACSAC) 2021",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We propose a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism called 2D-2FA to
address security and usability issues in existing methods. 2D-2FA has three
distinguishing features: First, after a user enters a username and password on
a login terminal, a unique $\textit{identifier}$ is displayed to her. She
$\textit{inputs}$ the same identifier on her registered 2FA device, which
ensures appropriate engagement in the authentication process. Second, a
one-time PIN is computed on the device and $\textit{automatically}$ transferred
to the server. Thus, the PIN can have very high entropy, making guessing
attacks infeasible. Third, the identifier is also incorporated into the PIN
computation, which renders $\textit{concurrent attacks}$ ineffective.
Third-party services such as push-notification providers and 2FA service
providers, do not need to be trusted for the security of the system. The choice
of identifiers depends on the device form factor and the context. Users could
choose to draw patterns, capture QR codes, etc.
  We provide a proof of concept implementation, and evaluate performance,
accuracy, and usability of the system. We show that the system offers a lower
error rate (about half) and better efficiency (2-3 times faster) compared to
the commonly used PIN-2FA. Our study indicates a high level of usability with a
SUS of 75, and a high perception of efficiency, security, accuracy, and
adoptability.

learning tasks, assuming that the local data owned by the clients are well
labeled. However, in many practical situations, it could be difficult and
expensive to acquire complete data labels. Federated semi-supervised learning
(Fed-SSL) is an attractive solution for fully utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Similar to that encountered in federated supervised learning,
class distribution of labeled/unlabeled data could be non-i.i.d. among clients.
Besides, in each client, the class distribution of labeled data may be distinct
from that of unlabeled data. Unfortunately, both can severely jeopardize the FL
performance. To address such challenging issues, we introduce two proper
regularization terms that can effectively alleviate the class distribution
mismatch problem in Fed-SSL. In addition, to overcome the non-i.i.d. data, we
leverage the variance reduction and normalized averaging techniques to develop
a novel Fed-SSL algorithm. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed method has

representations transform according to the way the inputs transform. Here, we
show that rather than using only invariance, pre-training that encourages
non-trivial equivariance to some transformations, while maintaining invariance

a simple additional pre-training objective encourages equivariance by
predicting the transformations applied to the input. We demonstrate E-SSL's

and platform (re-)design describes an engineering and management responsibility
to constantly evaluate any given platform for application fit and
platform-specific application design, and to consider a new or evolutionary
platform development project due to evolving and changing application needs.
  In this paper, we study this phenomenon in the context of serverless
computing and (big) data processing needs, and thus, for application-platform
co-design for serverless data processing (SDP). We present an analysis of the
state-of-the-art of function-as-a-service (FaaS) platforms, which reveals
several configuration, deployment, execution, and measurement differences

already ongoing platform (re-)design processes resulting in more specialized

design. We discuss data processing needs of applications using the serverless
model and present common initial (and undesirable) workaround solutions on the
application level, giving additional argument to the creation of new SDP
platforms. We present critical SDP requirements and possible new platform
augmentations, but identify the need for engineering methods and tooling to
better guide application-platform co-design. We argue to pay appropriate
attention to the phenomenon of continuous application-platform co-design to
better anticipate and to control future platform and application developments.

assignments are not known a priori. The algorithm Iteratively suggests Rotated
atom-centered reference frames and Assignments (Iterative Rotations and
Assignments, IRA). The frame for which a permutationally invariant set-set
distance, namely the Hausdorff distance, returns minimal value is chosen as the
solution of the matching problem. IRA is able to find rigid rotations,
reflections, translations, and permutations between structures with different
numbers of atoms, for any atomic arrangement and pattern, periodic or not. When
distortions are present between the structures, optimal rotation and
translation are found by further applying a standard Singular Value
Decomposition-based method. To compute the atomic assignments under the
one-to-one assignment constraint, we develop our own algorithm, Constrained
Shortest Distance Assignments (CShDA). The overall approach is extensively
tested on several structures, including distorted structural fragments.
Efficiency of the proposed algorithm is shown as a benchmark comparison against
two other shape matching algorithms. We discuss the use of our approach for the
identification and comparison of structures and structural fragments through
two examples: a replica exchange trajectory of a cyanine molecule, in which we
show how our approach could aid the exploration of relevant collective
coordinates for clustering the data; and an SiO$_2$ amorphous model, in which
we compute distortion scores and compare them with a classical strain-based
potential. The source code and benchmark data are available at

  Density Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate traffic state information plays a pivotal role in the Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), and it is an essential input to various smart
mobility applications such as signal coordination and traffic flow prediction.
The current practice to obtain the traffic state information is through
specialized sensors such as loop detectors and speed cameras. In most
metropolitan areas, traffic monitoring cameras have been installed to monitor
the traffic conditions on arterial roads and expressways, and the collected
videos or images are mainly used for visual inspection by traffic engineers.
Unfortunately, the data collected from traffic monitoring cameras are affected
by the 4L characteristics: Low frame rate, Low resolution, Lack of annotated
data, and Located in complex road environments. Therefore, despite the great
potentials of the traffic monitoring cameras, the 4L characteristics hinder
them from providing useful traffic state information (e.g., speed, flow,
density). This paper focuses on the traffic density estimation problem as it is
widely applicable to various traffic surveillance systems. To the best of our
knowledge, there is a lack of the holistic framework for addressing the 4L
characteristics and extracting the traffic density information from traffic
monitoring camera data. In view of this, this paper proposes a framework for
estimating traffic density using uncalibrated traffic monitoring cameras with
4L characteristics. The proposed framework consists of two major components:
camera calibration and vehicle detection. The camera calibration method
estimates the actual length between pixels in the images and videos, and the
vehicle counts are extracted from the deep-learning-based vehicle detection
method. Combining the two components, high-granular traffic density can be
estimated. To validate the proposed framework, two case studies were conducted
in Hong Kong and Sacramento. The results show that the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) in camera calibration is less than 0.2 meters out of 6 meters, and the
accuracy of vehicle detection under various conditions is approximately 90%.
Overall, the MAE for the estimated density is 9.04 veh/km/lane in Hong Kong and
1.30 veh/km/lane in Sacramento. The research outcomes can be used to calibrate
the speed-density fundamental diagrams, and the proposed framework can provide
accurate and real-time traffic information without installing additional
sensors.

are crucial for designers to incorporate new materials in virtual scenes,
making them look more realistic. Reconstruction of SVBRDFs is a long-standing
problem. Existing methods either rely on extensive acquisition system or
require huge datasets which are nontrivial to acquire. We aim to recover
SVBRDFs from a single image, without any datasets. A single image contains
incomplete information about the SVBRDF, making the reconstruction task highly
ill-posed. It is also difficult to separate between the changes in color that
are caused by the material and those caused by the illumination, without the
prior knowledge learned from the dataset. In this paper, we use an unsupervised
generative adversarial neural network (GAN) to recover SVBRDFs maps with a
single image as input. To better separate the effects due to illumination from
the effects due to the material, we add the hypothesis that the material is
stationary and introduce a new loss function based on Fourier coefficients to
enforce this stationarity. For efficiency, we train the network in two stages:
reusing a trained model to initialize the SVBRDFs and fine-tune it based on the
input image. Our method generates high-quality SVBRDFs maps from a single input
photograph, and provides more vivid rendering results compared to previous
work. The two-stage training boosts runtime performance, making it 8 times
faster than previous work.

In this modified version of the original {Rastall Gravity (RG)}, the coupling
parameter which is a representative of matter-curvature interaction is no
longer a constant parameter. Such a dynamic coupling may play the role of dark
energy which is responsible for the present accelerating expansion of the
Universe. Assuming then a linear equation of state (EoS) for the fluid
profiles, we seek for physically reasonable collapse scenarios in which the
spacetime singularity that occurs in general relativity (GR) is replaced by a
non-singular bounce. We therefore find that depending on model parameters, the
collapse process which starts from regular initial data, will halt at a minimum
value for the scale function and then turns into an expansion at a finite time.
We further find that there exists a minimum value for the initial radius of
collapsing object so that for radii smaller than this minimum radius, formation
of apparent horizon can be avoided and hence the bounce can be visible to the
observers within the Universe. We also compare our results to quantum corrected
collapse scenarios and find that the mutual interaction between matter and
geometry can play the role of quantum corrections to energy density.

philosophical interpretations of probability and stochasticity that are found

quantum mechanics, obtained by writing the Hamiltonian of a quantum system in a
way to render it mathematically equivalent to a deterministic system. Such
deterministic models are thought to consist of elementary cells - cellular
automata - inside which the quantities describing the dynamics oscillate in
periodic orbits, extending and replacing the quantum-mechanical classical
language based on harmonic oscillators. Here we show that the structure of the
cellular automata sets find a clear physical interpretation with the
infinite-components equation published by Majorana in 1932, also known as the
Majorana Tower: the cellular automata are elementary building blocks generated
by the Poincar\'e group of spacetime transformations with positive-defined
energy down to the elementary building blocks of the fabric of spacetime.
Interestingly, the mathematical approach here considered presents close
relationships with those used for the distribution of prime numbers in the
P\'olya-Hilbert conjecture for the Riemann Hypothesis.

major meta-learning approaches. The results motivate us to innovate in two
designs: i) a dual-path base HAR network, where both time and frequency domains
are dedicated to learning powerful RF features including spatial and
attention-based temporal ones, and ii) a metric-based meta-learning framework
to enhance the fast adaption capability of the base network, including an
RF-specific metric module along with a residual classification module. We
conduct extensive experiments based on all three RF sensing techniques in
multiple real-world indoor environments; all results strongly demonstrate the
efficacy of RF-Net compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

  Scalable Array with Miniaturized and Efficient Power Delivery Network",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Next generation communication and sensing require enabling technologies for
miniaturized and efficient heterogeneous systems while integrating technologies
ranging from silicon to compound semiconductors and from photonic chips to
micro-sensors. To this end, high frequency and mm-wave (MMW) lossy parasitics
and delay between modules need to be significantly reduced to minimize area,
loss and thermal heating of inter-chip wiring and power delivery networks. In
this work, we propose novel approaches to achieve an efficient wideband MMW
array integrations. The proposed techniques are built upon the following: 1)
fixed antenna package buildup for every element with differential excitation on
two half sides of array to reduce the fabrication cost and the IC-to-antenna
routing loss; 2) miniaturized aperture coupled local oscillator (LO) and
intermediate frequency (IF) power delivery feed distribution to minimize the
packaging stacked layers and their loss. The proposed 16-element antenna array
is integrated which 4 dies in 2x2 configurations implemented in a 90-nm SiGe
BiCMOS process using compact Weaver image-selection architecture (WISA). The
proposed miniaturized and efficient architecture from circuit and chip level to
package level results in 1.5 GHz modulation bandwidth for 64 QAM (9 Gb/s) and 2
GHz for 16 QAM with only +-2 dB EVM variation over the 20% FBW (71-86 GHz). The
system produces 30-dBm EIRP with enhanced efficiency of 25% EIRP/PDC over the
bandwidth

intelligence to make significant progress. The ongoing surge to solve math word
problems (MWPs) and hence achieve better mathematical reasoning ability would
continue to be a key line of research in the coming time. We inspect non-neural
and neural methods to solve math word problems narrated in a natural language.
We also highlight the ability of these methods to be generalizable,
mathematically reasonable, interpretable, and explainable. Neural approaches
dominate the current state of the art, and we survey them highlighting three
strategies to MWP solving: (1) direct answer generation, (2) expression tree
generation for inferring answers, and (3) template retrieval for answer
computation. Moreover, we discuss technological approaches, review the
evolution of intuitive design choices to solve MWPs, and examine them for
mathematical reasoning ability. We finally identify several gaps that warrant
the need for external knowledge and knowledge-infused learning, among several
other opportunities in solving MWPs.

  Study in Japan","14 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in December 2019, progressed in a
complicated manner and thus caused problems worldwide. Seeking clues to the
reasons for the complicated progression is necessary but challenging in the
fight against the pandemic. We sought clues by investigating the relationship
between reactions on social media and the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. Twitter
was selected as the social media platform for study because it has a large user
base in Japan and because it quickly propagates short topic-focused messages
(""tweets""). Analysis using Japanese Twitter data suggests that reactions on
social media and the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a close
relationship. Experiments to evaluate the potential of using tweets to support
the prediction of how an epidemic will progress demonstrated the value of using
epidemic-related social media data. Our findings provide insights into the
relationship between user reactions on social media, particularly Twitter, and
epidemic progression, which can be used to fight pandemics.

yield state-of-the-art solutions to the magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG)
brain source localization problem. In this paper we tackle the model selection
problem of these estimators: we propose to use a proxy of the Stein's Unbiased
Risk Estimator (SURE) to automatically select their regularization parameters.
The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on realistic simulations and
$30$ subjects from the Cam-CAN dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first
time that sparsity promoting estimators are automatically calibrated at such a
scale. Results show that the proposed SURE approach outperforms
cross-validation strategies and state-of-the-art Bayesian statistics methods
both computationally and statistically.
