corals, and dentin combine complex biological functions with structural roles,
such as skeletal support and impact protection1,2. They feature complex
structural hierarchies from nano- to macroscale that enable optimization of
both strength and toughness (flaw tolerance) simultaneously3-9. These
hierarchies typically exhibit structural disorder in the arrangement of pores.
The degree of disorder, however, has not been systematically quantified before,
and its role in the mechanical performance of cellular biomaterials is
generally unknown. Here we have applied Voronoi tessellations to quantify the
cell size variation in 2D cross-sections of biological and engineered cellular
materials, using a disorder parameter (d) ranging between 0 (highly disordered)
to 1.0 (regular hexagonal honeycomb). We demonstrate that various plant, fungi,
and animal cellular materials show characteristic ranges of disorder. Using 3D
printed analogues and numerical methods, we demonstrate experimentally a range
of pseudo-order (d=0.6 to 0.8) that exhibits a > 30% increase in fracture
toughness (and equivalent strength) compared to hexagonal honeycombs (d=1.0) of
equal density. Our results show this range of disorder is similar to that
identified in the biological examples, which suggests convergent evolution.
This optimal degree of structural disorder limits catastrophic failure,
providing an evolutionary advantage for organism survival. Distributed
structural damage limits cracks below a maximum threshold size and also enables
tissue repair mechanisms after trauma. Our work shows that tailored disorder
should be considered as a new design paradigm for digitally fabricated,

quantization of the gravity-matter system, where the time parameter is defined

quantum matter. The procedure here used implements a Born-Oppenheimer-like
separation of the system, which maintains covariance under the foliation of the
gravitational background and keeps the correct classical limit of standard
quantum field theory on a fixed background. It is shown with a WKB expansion
that quantum gravity corrections to the matter dynamics arise at the next order
of expansion, and such contributions are unitary, signalling a striking
difference from previous proposals. Applications to a cosmological model are
presented and the analogies of the kinematical term with an incoherent dust are

neural network, and we are given $n$ training points in $d$-dimensional space.
In this paper, we propose two novel preprocessing ideas to bypass this

we can train the neural network in $\widetilde{O}(m^{1-\Theta(1/d)} n d)$ cost

sparsity observation in practical work, high-dimensional geometric search in
data structure, concentration and anti-concentration in probability. Our
results also provide theoretical insights for a large number of previously

responses for left- and right-circular polarization. Here, we show that a
perfectly achiral nanostructure, a plasmonic metamolecule with trigonal D3h

experimentally evidenced with nanoscale resolution using a molecular probe. Our

prime $p$ means to produce $T \in \operatorname{Mat}(n+1, \mathbb{Z}) \cap
\operatorname{GL}(n+1, \mathbb{Q})$ and $e \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ such that
$F_1 = p^{-e} F([x_0, \ldots, x_n] \cdot T)$ has integral coefficients and
$v_p(I(F_1))$ is minimal among all such $F_1$. Following Koll\'ar, the
minimization process can be described in terms of applying weight vectors $w
\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}^{n+1}$ to $F$. We show that for any dimension $n$ and
degree $d$, there is a complete set of weight vectors consisting of
$[0,w_1,w_2,\dots,w_n]$ with $0 \le w_1 \le w_2 \le \dots \le w_n \le 2 n
d^{n-1}$. When $n = 2$, we improve the bound to $d$. This answers a question
raised by Koll\'ar.
  Based on this result and a further study of the minimization process in the
planar case $n = 2$, we devise an efficient minimization algorithm for ternary
forms (equivalently, plane curves) of arbitrary degree $d$. We also describe a
similar algorithm that allows to minimize (and reduce) cubic surfaces. The
algorithms are available in Magma.

vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-bonding
domain (RBD), which occurred in co-mutation [Y449S, N501Y], has reduced
infectivity compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing
antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracing the evolutionary trajectories
of vaccine-resistant mutations in over 1.9 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we
reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations
correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We
anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-resistant
mutations will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most
of the world's population is vaccinated. Our study sheds light on SARS-CoV-2

\begin{equation*} \sqrt{\rho} = |\psi|, \quad J = \sqrt{\rho} \Lambda = \Im
\big( \bar \psi \nabla \psi). \end{equation*} The second equation gives for
$\psi = \sqrt{\rho} w$ smooth, $|w| = 1$, that $i \Lambda = \sqrt{\rho} \bar w

  Interpreting $\rho \mathcal L^d$ as a measure in the metric space $\R^d$,
this question can be stated in generality as follows: given metric measure
space $(X,d,\mu)$ and a cotangent vector field $v \in L^2(T^* X)$, is there a
function $w \in H^1(\mu,\mathbb S^1)$ such that \begin{equation*} dw = i w v.

  We show that under some assumptions on the metric measure space $(X,d,\mu)$
(conditions which are verified on Riemann manifolds with the measure $\mu =
\rho \mathrm{Vol}$ or more generally on non-branching $MCP(K,N)$), we show that
the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of $w$ is that (in
the case of differentiable manifold) \begin{equation*} \int v(\gamma(t)) \cdot
\dot \gamma (t) dt \in 2\pi \Z \end{equation*} for $\pi$-a.e. $\gamma$, where
$\pi$ is a test plan supported on closed curves. This condition generalizes the
conditions that the vorticity is quantized. We also give a representation of
every possible solution.
  In particular, we deduce that the wave function $\psi = \sqrt{\rho} w$ is in
$W^{1,2}(X)$ whenever $\sqrt{\rho} \in W^{1,2}(X)$.

navigation, is a need to learn task intent and safety guarantees through user
interactions in order to ensure safe task performance. For tasks where the
objectives from the user are not easily defined, learning from user
demonstrations has been a key step in enabling learning. However, most robot
learning from demonstration (LfD) methods primarily rely on optimal
demonstration in order to successfully learn a control policy, which can be
challenging to acquire from novice users. Recent work does use suboptimal and
failed demonstrations to learn about task intent; few focus on learning safety
guarantees to prevent repeat failures experienced, essential for assistive
robots. Furthermore, interactive human-robot learning aims to minimize effort
from the human user to facilitate deployment in the real-world. As such,
requiring users to label the unsafe states or keyframes from the demonstrations
should not be a necessary requirement for learning. Here, we propose an
algorithm to learn a safety value function from a set of suboptimal and failed
demonstrations that is used to generate a real-time safety control filter.
Importantly, we develop a credit assignment method that extracts the failure
states from the failed demonstrations without requiring human labelling or
prespecified knowledge of unsafe regions. Furthermore, we extend our
formulation to allow for user-specific safety functions, by incorporating
user-defined safety rankings from which we can generate safety level sets
according to the users' preferences. By using both suboptimal and failed
demonstrations and the developed credit assignment formulation, we enable
learning a safety value function with minimal effort needed from the user,
making it more feasible for widespread use in human-robot interactive learning
tasks.

determine that the large thickness gradients present in the structure are the
main mechanism for 3D DW automotion. We obtain direct evidence of how this
tailorable magnetic energy gradient is imprinted in the devices, and how it
competes with pinning effects due to local changes in the energy landscape. Our
work also predicts how this effect could lead to high DW velocities, reaching
the Walker limit during automotion. This work provides new possibilities for

provide a quantum advantage in finding approximate solutions to combinatorial
optimization problems, noise in the system is a hurdle in exploiting its full

effect of noise on this algorithm. Recently, Majumdar et al. proposed a Depth
First Search (DFS) based method to reduce $n-1$ CNOT gates in the ansatz design
of QAOA for finding Max-Cut in a graph G = (V, E), |V| = n. However, this
method tends to increase the depth of the circuit, making it more prone to
relaxation error. The depth of the circuit is proportional to the height of the
DFS tree, which can be $n-1$ in the worst case. In this paper, we propose an
$O(\Delta \cdot n^2)$ greedy heuristic algorithm, where $\Delta$ is the maximum
degree of the graph, that finds a spanning tree of lower height, thus reducing
the overall depth of the circuit while still retaining the $n-1$ reduction in
the number of CNOT gates needed in the ansatz. We numerically show that this
algorithm achieves nearly 10 times increase in the probability of success for
each iteration of QAOA for Max-Cut. We further show that although the average
depth of the circuit produced by this heuristic algorithm still grows linearly
with n, our algorithm reduces the slope of the linear increase from 1 to 0.11.

feasibility of using satisficing dynamics to guide independent learners to
approximate equilibrium in stochastic games. For $\epsilon \geq 0$, an
$\epsilon$-satisficing policy update rule is any rule that instructs the agent
to not change its policy when it is $\epsilon$-best-responding to the policies

parsing from English to a diverse set of languages and conduct two sets of
experiments. In one, we analyze zero-shot performance based on the extent to
which English source edges are preserved in translation. In another, we apply
three linguistically motivated transformations to UD, creating more
cross-lingually stable versions of it, and assess their zero-shot parsability.
In order to compare parsing performance across different schemes, we perform
extrinsic evaluation on the downstream task of cross-lingual relation
extraction (RE) using a subset of a popular English RE benchmark translated to
Russian and Korean. In both sets of experiments, our results suggest a strong
relation between cross-lingual stability and zero-shot parsing performance.

  Reinforcement Learning","Short version in Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information
  Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021); Full version in Information and Inference:
  A Journal of the IMA",,,,"cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Achieving sample efficiency in online episodic reinforcement learning (RL)
requires optimally balancing exploration and exploitation. When it comes to a
finite-horizon episodic Markov decision process with $S$ states, $A$ actions
and horizon length $H$, substantial progress has been achieved towards
characterizing the minimax-optimal regret, which scales on the order of
$\sqrt{H^2SAT}$ (modulo log factors) with $T$ the total number of samples.
While several competing solution paradigms have been proposed to minimize
regret, they are either memory-inefficient, or fall short of optimality unless
the sample size exceeds an enormous threshold (e.g., $S^6A^4
\,\mathrm{poly}(H)$ for existing model-free methods).
  To overcome such a large sample size barrier to efficient RL, we design a
novel model-free algorithm, with space complexity $O(SAH)$, that achieves
near-optimal regret as soon as the sample size exceeds the order of
$SA\,\mathrm{poly}(H)$. In terms of this sample size requirement (also referred
to the initial burn-in cost), our method improves -- by at least a factor of
$S^5A^3$ -- upon any prior memory-efficient algorithm that is asymptotically
regret-optimal. Leveraging the recently introduced variance reduction strategy
(also called {\em reference-advantage decomposition}), the proposed algorithm
employs an {\em early-settled} reference update rule, with the aid of two
Q-learning sequences with upper and lower confidence bounds. The design
principle of our early-settled variance reduction method might be of
independent interest to other RL settings that involve intricate
exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

the arithmetical hierarchy, a classification of languages according to the
complexity of arithmetical formulas defining them. It was recently shown by Ji,
Natarajan, Vidick, Wright and Yuen that deciding whether the
(finite-dimensional) quantum value of a nonlocal game is $1$ or at most
$\frac{1}{2}$ is complete for the class $\Sigma_1$ (i.e., $\mathsf{RE}$). A
result of Slofstra implies that deciding whether the commuting operator value
of a nonlocal game is equal to $1$ is complete for the class $\Pi_1$ (i.e.,
$\mathsf{coRE}$). We prove that deciding whether the quantum value of a
two-player nonlocal game is exactly equal to $1$ is complete for $\Pi_2$; this
class is in the second level of the arithmetical hierarchy and corresponds to
formulas of the form ""$\forall x \, \exists y \, \phi(x,y)$"". This shows that
exactly computing the quantum value is strictly harder than approximating it,
and also strictly harder than computing the commuting operator value (either
exactly or approximately). We explain how results about the complexity of
nonlocal games all follow in a unified manner from a technique known as
compression. At the core of our $\Pi_2$-completeness result is a new ""gapless""
compression theorem that holds for both quantum and commuting operator
strategies. Our compression theorem yields as a byproduct an alternative proof
of Slofstra's result that the set of quantum correlations is not closed. We
also show how a ""gap-preserving"" compression theorem for commuting operator

low-rank MDP. We study both the online RL and offline RL settings. For the
online setting, operating with the same computational oracles used in FLAMBE
(Agarwal et.al), the state-of-art algorithm for learning representations in
low-rank MDPs, we propose an algorithm REP-UCB Upper Confidence Bound driven

balances the interplay between representation learning, exploration, and
exploitation, while FLAMBE is an explore-then-commit style approach and has to
perform reward-free exploration step-by-step forward in time. For the offline

features together with power band features and feed them to several standard
classifiers, e.g. Random Forest,Gradient Boosting. Model selection is thus
completed after a meticulous phase of bayesian hyperparameter optimization.
With our method, we observed robust results in terms of ac-curacy for a
four-labels classification problem, with limited available data. Through
feature importance investigation, we conclude that topological descriptors are
able to extract useful discriminative information and provide novel
insights.Since our data are restricted to single-patient recordings,
generalization might be limited. Nevertheless, our method can be extended and
applied to a wide range of neurophysiological recordings and it might be an
intriguing point of departure for future studies.

introduce a new streaming decision layer, derived using the notion of temporal

a small degradation in accuracy compared with the invocation-specific models,
and (ii) that the newly introduced streaming TCN consistently performs better
or comparable with the alternatives, while mitigating device undirected speech
faster in time, and with (relative) reduction in runtime peak-memory over the

still struggle when there are large motion or viewpoint discrepancies between
the source and driving images. In this paper, we introduce three measures that
we found to be effective for overcoming such large viewpoint changes. Firstly,
to achieve more fine-grained motion deformation fields, we propose to apply
Neural-ODEs for parametrizing the evolution dynamics of the motion transfer
from source to driving. Secondly, to handle occlusions caused by large
viewpoint and motion changes, we take advantage of the appearance flow obtained
from the source image itself (""self-appearance""), which essentially ""borrows""
similar structures from other regions of an image to inpaint missing regions.
Finally, our framework is also able to leverage the information from additional
reference views which help to drive the source identity in spite of varying
motion state. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms
the state-of-the-arts by a significant margin (~40%), across six benchmarks
varying from human faces, human bodies to robots and cartoon characters. Model

development of algorithms that can find solutions to problems that can
generalize to different environments and tasks. Unlike AI, humans are adept at
finding solutions that can transfer. We hypothesize this is because their
solutions are informed by causal models. We propose to use human-guided causal
knowledge to help robots find solutions that can generalize to a new
environment. We develop and test the feasibility of a language interface that
na\""ive participants can use to communicate these causal models to a planner.
We find preliminary evidence that participants are able to use our interface
and generate causal models that achieve near-generalization. We outline an
experiment aimed at testing far-generalization using our interface and describe
our longer terms goals for these causal models.

symmetry of the transition metal (M) site in two-dimensional van der Waals
MX$_2$ dihalides and MX$_3$ trihalides. The trigonal symmetry leads to a 2-2-1
orbital splitting of the transition metal $d$ shell, which may be tuned by the
interlayer distance, and changes in the ligand-ligand bond lengths. Orbital
order coupled to various lower symmetry lattice modes may lift the remaining
orbital degeneracies, and we explain how these may support unique electronic
states using ZrI$_2$ and CuCl$_2$ as examples, and offer a brief overview of
possible electronic configurations in this class of materials. By building and
analysing Wannier models adapted to the appropriate symmetry we examine how the
interplay among trigonal symmetry, electronic correlation effects, and $p$-$d$
orbital charge transfer leads to insulating, orbitally polarized magnetic
and/or orbital-selective Mott states. Our work establishes a rigorous framework
to understand, control, and tune the electronic states in low-dimensional
correlated halides. Our analysis shows that trigonal symmetry and its breaking
is a key feature of the 2D halides that needs to be accounted for in search of
novel electronic states in materials ranging from CrI$_3$ to $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

reveals that it occupies large portions of the Brillouin zone (BZ), where no
bulk band is expected. Upon electron doping (deposition of Rb-atoms), the
system evolves in a surprising way. Besides the expected down-shifting of the
bands, a splitting of both bulk and the dispersion-less emission is observed.
This peculiar behaviour strongly suggests the intrinsic nature of this
emission. Its characterization may therefore be relevant to a deeper
understanding of the physics of transition metal dichalcogenides.

  arXiv:1907.07238",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lazy graph search algorithms are efficient at solving motion planning
problems where edge evaluation is the computational bottleneck. These
algorithms work by lazily computing the shortest potentially feasible path,
evaluating edges along that path, and repeating until a feasible path is found.
The order in which edges are selected is critical to minimizing the total
number of edge evaluations: a good edge selector chooses edges that are not
only likely to be invalid, but also eliminates future paths from consideration.
We wish to learn such a selector by leveraging prior experience. We formulate
this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) on the state of the search
problem. While solving this large MDP is generally intractable, we show that we
can compute oracular selectors that can solve the MDP during training. With
access to such oracles, we use imitation learning to find effective policies.
If new search problems are sufficiently similar to problems solved during
training, the learned policy will choose a good edge evaluation ordering and
solve the motion planning problem quickly. We evaluate our algorithms on a wide
range of 2D and 7D problems and show that the learned selector outperforms
baseline commonly used heuristics. We further provide a novel theoretical
analysis of lazy search in a Bayesian framework as well as regret guarantees on
our imitation learning based approach to motion planning.

  Antenna's Performance Utilizing 3-D Printing","101 pages, 33 tables, 69 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The monopole antenna is widely used in communication applications and is
typically mounted on various surfaces that act as ground planes; a prime
example being the roof of a car. The shape of the ground plane can drastically
change the patterns of the electromagnetic radiation of a monopole antenna as
well as its RF performance. Extensive work has been done on the numerical
modeling of arbitrarily shaped ground planes. However, due to their geometric
complexity, there is very little work reported on the practical testing
component of physical antennas with these obscure ground plane structures. This
thesis illustrates how the additive manufacturing process presented can be used
to physically realize arbitrarily shaped ground planes and provides a low-cost
process to verify the numerical model. Ground Planes were modified while
maintaining the same antenna length to evaluate the impact on antenna
performance. The antenna was not optimized or changed to a standard antenna
design. Varying radius spherical ground planes are modelled, as well as
modified ground plane structures to evaluate the impact of the ground plane on
a 1.3GHz monopole antenna's performance and in some cases to modify the
antenna's performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, and radiation pattern.
Designs such as the planar ground with horn was found to enhance monopole
bandwidth by more than 5 times that of a standard planar ground but
significantly deteriorate the antenna's radiation pattern. Moreover, complex
geometry such as the fin sphere ground plane offered a 25% increase in gain
relative to the standard sphere ground. Designs like the edge-mounted sphere
can offer directive gain and radiation characteristics simply by altering the
antennas' location mount location with respect to its ground plane. The
techniques presented in this thesis offer new ways of producing 3D printed
ground planes for RF applications.

R_0(1+z)^{\zeta}$ at low redshift ($z\lesssim0.5$), with
$R_0\sim316$-$784\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$ and $\zeta\sim1.34$-$2.03$,
respectively. Our results also show that $R_{0}$ and $\zeta$ depend on settings
of BSE model parameters, and thus accurate estimates of these parameters by
future GW detections will put strong constraints on BSE models. We further
estimate that the fractions of BNS mergers hosted in spiral and elliptical
galaxies at $z\sim0$ are $\sim81$%-$84$% and $\sim16$%-$19$%, respectively. The
BNS merger rate per galaxy can be well determined by the host galaxy stellar
mass, star formation rate, and metallicity, which provides a guidance in search
for most probable candidates of BNS host galaxies.

optimization (MBO) algorithm using reference vectors for scalarization of
objective functions. The Kriging surrogate models for MBO is used to estimate
the Pareto front shape and generate adaptive reference vectors uniformly
distributed on the estimated Pareto front. We combine SRVA with expected
improvement of penalty-based boundary intersection as an infill criterion for
MBO. The proposed algorithm is compared with two other MBO algorithms by
applying them to benchmark problems with various Pareto front shapes.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other two
in the problems whose objective functions are reasonably approximated by the
Kriging models. SRVA improves diversity of non-dominated solutions for these
problems with continuous, discontinuous, and degenerated Pareto fronts.
Besides, the proposed algorithm obtains much better solutions from early stages
of optimization especially in many-objective problems.

that relatively high-quality maps exist in most parts of the world, in
practice, inference approaches must be applied to update existing maps rather
than infer new ones. With recent road extraction methods showing high accuracy,
we argue that it is time to transition to the more practical map update task,
where an existing map is updated by adding, removing, and shifting roads,
without introducing errors in parts of the existing map that remain up-to-date.
In this paper, we develop a new dataset called MUNO21 for the map update task,

evaluate several state-of-the-art road extraction methods on MUNO21, and find

oscillations in a large quiescent filament prior to its successful eruption on
2015 April 28. The eruption of a smaller filament that was parallel and in
close, 350 proximity was observed to induce longitudinal oscillations and
enhance mass-draining within the filament of interest. The longitudinal
oscillation with an amplitude of 25 Mm and 23 km underwent no damping during
its observable cycle. Subsequently the slightly enhanced draining may have
excited a eruption behind the limb, leading to a feedback that further enhanced
the draining and induced simultaneous oscillations within the filament of
interest. We find significant damping for these simultaneous oscillations,
where the transverse oscillations proceeded with the amplitudes of 15 Mm and 14
km, while the longitudinal oscillations involved a larger displacement and
velocity amplitude (57 Mm, 43 km). The second grouping of oscillation lasted
for 2 cycles and had the similar period of 2 hours. From this, the curvature
radius and transverse magnetic field strength of the magnetic dips supporting
the filaments can be estimated to be 355 Mm and 34 G. The mass-draining within
the filament of interest lasted for 14 hours. The apparent velocity grew from
35 km to 85 km, with the transition being coincident with the occurrence of the
oscillations. We conclude that two filament eruptions are sympathetic, i.e. the
eruption of the quiescent filament was triggered by the eruption of the nearby
smaller filament.

differential equation via an integral equation method. Due to the lack of the
monotonicity of the discretization coefficients of the variable-order
fractional derivative in standard approximation schemes, existing numerical
analysis techniques do not apply directly. By an approximate inversion
technique, the proposed model is transformed as a second kind Volterra integral
equation, based on which a collocation method under uniform or graded mesh is
developed and analyzed. In particular, the error estimates improve the existing
results by proving a consistent and sharper mesh grading parameter and
characterizing the convergence rates in terms of the initial value of the
variable order, which demonstrates its critical role in determining the
smoothness of the solutions and thus the numerical accuracy.

to generate fine-grained landmark faces with more details. The network refines
the manipulated landmarks and generates a smooth and gradually changing face

foreground/background mask loss as well as boundary loss are designed, which
aims at synthesizing clear and sharp high-quality faces. Experiments are
conducted on our self-collected BeautySelfie and the public VoxCeleb1 datasets.

explore. With the advancement of deep learning, recent works try to utilize
deep convolutional neural networks to synthesize a video with the aid of a
guiding video, and have achieved promising results. However, the acquisition of
guiding videos, or other forms of guiding temporal information is costly
expensive and difficult in reality. Therefore, in this work we introduce a new
video synthesis task by employing two rough bad-drwan sketches only as input to
create a realistic portrait video. A two-stage Sketch-to-Video model is
proposed, which consists of two key novelties: 1) a feature retrieve and
projection (FRP) module, which parititions the input sketch into different
parts and utilizes these parts for synthesizing a realistic start or end frame
and meanwhile generating rich semantic features, is designed to alleviate the
sketch out-of-domain problem due to arbitrarily drawn free-form sketch styles
by different users. 2) A motion projection followed by feature blending module,
which projects a video (used only in training phase) into a motion space
modeled by normal distribution and blends the motion variables with semantic
features extracted above, is proposed to alleviate the guiding temporal
information missing problem in the test phase. Experiments conducted on a

approach to train NLU models. Such models need to be deployed on devices across
the cloud and the edge with varying resource and accuracy constraints. For a
given task, repeating pre-training and fine-tuning across tens of devices is
prohibitively expensive. We propose SuperShaper, a task agnostic pre-training
approach which simultaneously pre-trains a large number of Transformer models
by varying shapes, i.e., by varying the hidden dimensions across layers. This
is enabled by a backbone network with linear bottleneck matrices around each
Transformer layer which are sliced to generate differently shaped sub-networks.
In spite of its simple design space and efficient implementation, SuperShaper
discovers networks that effectively trade-off accuracy and model size:
Discovered networks are more accurate than a range of hand-crafted and
automatically searched networks on GLUE benchmarks. Further, we find two
critical advantages of shape as a design variable for Neural Architecture
Search (NAS): (a) heuristics of good shapes can be derived and networks found
with these heuristics match and even improve on carefully searched networks
across a range of parameter counts, and (b) the latency of networks across
multiple CPUs and GPUs are insensitive to the shape and thus enable
device-agnostic search. In summary, SuperShaper radically simplifies NAS for
language models and discovers networks that generalize across tasks, parameter
constraints, and devices.

has been at the center of much attention in the field of real-time
reconstruction in Compressed Sensing (CS). Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is
the most widely used reconstruction algorithm on hardware implementation
because OMP obtains good quality reconstruction results under a proper time
cost. OMP includes Dot Product (DP) and Least Square Problem (LSP). These two
parts have numerous division calculations and considerable vector-based
multiplications, which limit the implementation of real-time reconstruction on
hardware. In the theory of CS, besides the reconstruction algorithm, the choice
of sensing matrix affects the quality of reconstruction. It also influences the
reconstruction efficiency by affecting the hardware architecture. Thus,
designing a real-time hardware architecture of OMP needs to take three factors
into consideration. The choice of sensing matrix, the implementation of DP and
LSP. In this paper, a sensing matrix, which is sparsity and contains zero
vectors mainly, is adopted to optimize the OMP reconstruction to break the
bottleneck of reconstruction efficiency. Based on the features of the chosen
matrix, the DP and LSP are implemented by simple shift, add and comparing
procedures. This work is implemented on the Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA
device. To reconstruct a digital signal with 1024 length under 0.25 sampling
rate, the proposal method costs 0.818us while the state-of-the-art costs
238$us. Thus, this work speedups the state-of-the-art method 290 times. This
work costs 0.026s to reconstruct an 8K gray image, which achieves 30FPS

complexity in dynamic systems that are represented as linear Gaussian state
space (SS) models. However, this model-based algorithm is limited in systems
that are only partially known, as well as non-linear and non-Gaussian. In this
work we propose RTSNet, a highly efficient model-based and data-driven

dedicated trainable models into the flow of the classical RTS smoother, while
iteratively refining its sequence estimate via deep unfolding methodology. As a
result, RTSNet learns from data to reliably smooth when operating under model
mismatch and non-linearities while retaining the efficiency and
interpretability of the model-based RTS algorithm. Our empirical study
demonstrates that RTSNet overcomes non-linearities and model mismatch,
outperforming classic smoothers operating with both mismatched and accurate
domain knowledge. Moreover, while RTSNet is based on compact neural networks,
which leads to faster training and inference times, it is shown to outperform
previously proposed deep smoothers in non-linear settings.

critical step for radiation therapy treatment planning. The delineation
procedure is typically performed manually which exposes two major issues: cost
and reproducibility. Delineation is a time-consuming process that is subject to
inter- and intra-observer variability. While methods have been proposed to
predict GTV contours, typical approaches ignore variability and therefore fail
to utilize the valuable confidence information offered by multiple contours.
Materials and methods: In this work we propose an automatic GTV contouring
method for soft-tissue sarcomas from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images,
using deep learning by integrating inter- and intra-observer variability in the
learned model. Sixty-eight patients with soft tissue and bone sarcomas were
considered in this evaluation, all underwent pre-operative CT imaging used to
perform GTV delineation. Four radiation oncologists and radiologists performed
three contouring trials each for all patients. We quantify variability by
defining confidence levels based on the frequency of inclusion of a given voxel
into the GTV and use a deep convolutional neural network to learn GTV
confidence maps. Results: Results were compared to confidence maps from the
four readers as well as ground-truth consensus contours established jointly by
all readers. The resulting continuous Dice score between predicted and true
confidence maps was 87% and the Hausdorff distance was 14 mm. Conclusion:
Results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to predict accurate
contours while utilizing variability and as such it can be used to improve
clinical workflow.

decision-maker are important for people's acceptance of and compliance with the

hopes and concerns about building artificially intelligent entities that are
designed to intervene against norm violations. However, it is unclear how
people would perceive artificial moral regulators that impose punishment on
human wrongdoers. Grounded in theories of psychology and law, we predict that
the perceived fairness of punishment imposed by a robot would increase the
legitimacy of the robot functioning as a moral regulator, which would in turn,
increase people's willingness to accept and comply with the robot's decisions.
We close with a conceptual framework for building a robot moral regulator that
successfully can regulate norm violations.

of DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 are presented and the long-standing model-independent

of a signal that meets all the requirements of the model independent Dark
Matter annual modulation signature, at 11.8 $\sigma$ C.L. in the energy region
(1-6) keV. In the energy region between 2 and 6 keV, where data are also
available from DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 (2.86 ton $\times$ yr), the
achieved C.L. is 13.7 $\sigma$; the modulation amplitude of the single-hit
scintillation events is: $(0.01014 \pm 0.00074)$ cpd/kg/keV, the measured phase
is $(142.4 \pm 4.2)$ days and the measured period is $(0.99834 \pm 0.00067)$

in medical images is significant in clinical practice. Convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) based on the coarse-to-fine strategy have been widely used in
this field. However, multi-lesion segmentation remains to be challenging due to
the uncertainty in size, contrast, and high interclass similarity of tissues.
In addition, the commonly adopted cascaded strategy is rather demanding in
terms of hardware, which limits the potential of clinical deployment. To
address the problems above,we propose a novel Prior Attention Network (PANet)
that follows the coarse-to-fine strategy to perform multi-lesion segmentation
in medical images. The proposed network achieves the two steps of segmentation
in a single network by inserting lesion-related spatial attention mechanism in
the network. Further, we also propose the intermediate supervision strategy for
generating lesion-related attention to acquire the regions of interest (ROIs),
which accelerates the convergence and obviously improves the segmentation
performance. We have investigated the proposed segmentation framework in two
applications: 2D segmentation of multiple lung infections in lung CT slices and
3D segmentation of multiple lesions in brain MRIs. Experimental results show
that in both 2D and 3D segmentation tasks our proposed network achieves better
performance with less computational cost compared with cascaded networks. The
proposed network can be regarded as a universal solution to multi-lesion
segmentation in both 2D and 3D tasks. The source code is available at:

Skewed distribution is a problem for time series classification both in
distance-based and feature-based algorithms under the condition of poor class
separability. To address the imbalance problem, both sampling-based and

evaporation losses, especially in regions that are prone to drought. Changes in
climatic factors, such as changes in temperature, wind speed, sunshine hours,
humidity, and solar radiation can have a significant impact on the evaporation

newly explored ML models for modeling evaporation losses in three different

eliminate isolation boundaries between tenants, such as strict process
isolation, and instead let them compute in a more lightweight multi-threaded

mechanisms, e.g., tenants can only run sandboxed V8 JavaScript code. While this
is as secure as a sandbox for software vulnerabilities, microarchitectural
attacks can bypass these sandboxes.
  In this paper, we show that it is possible to mount a Spectre attack on such
a restricted environment, leaking secrets from co-located tenants. Cloudflare
Workers is one of the top three edge-computing solutions and handles millions
of HTTP requests per second worldwide across tens of thousands of web sites

techniques in combination with a remote timing server, which is capable of
leaking 120 bit/h. This motivates our main contribution, Dynamic Process
Isolation, a process isolation mechanism that only isolates suspicious worker

positives, Dynamic Process Isolation simply degrades to process isolation. Our
proof-of-concept implementation augments a real-world cloud infrastructure

a false-positive rate of only 0.61%, we demonstrate that our solution vastly
outperforms strict process isolation in terms of performance. In our security
evaluation, we show that Dynamic Process Isolation statistically provides the

findings suggest that although EIP-1559 achieves its goals on average,
short-term behavior is marked by intense, chaotic oscillations in block sizes

adjustments during periods of demand bursts (e.g., NFT drops). Both phenomena
lead to unwanted inter-block variability in mining rewards. To address this

we use contrastive predictive coding (CPC) module to further smooth the voices

the naturalness of converted singing voices and the similarity with the target

  In this paper, we propose a novel unified pipeline for both tasks, generation
of both geometry and texture, and recovery of high-fidelity texture. Our
texture model is learned, in an unsupervised fashion, from natural images as
opposed to scanned texture maps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first such unified framework independent of scanned textures.
  Our novel training pipeline incorporates a pre-trained 2D facial generator
coupled with a deep feature manipulation methodology. By applying precise 3DMM
fitting, we can seamlessly integrate our modeled textures into synthetically

model with background, hair, teeth, and body. This enables us to apply transfer

massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with phase shift keying

(CI)-based problem formulation. The existence of the discrete one-bit
constraint makes the problem generally hard to solve. In this paper, we propose
an efficient negative $\ell_1$ penalty approach for finding a high-quality
solution of the considered problem. Specifically, we first propose a novel
negative $\ell_1$ penalty model, which penalizes the one-bit constraint into
the objective with a negative $\ell_1$-norm term, and show the equivalence
between (global and local) solutions of the original problem and the penalty
problem when the penalty parameter is sufficiently large. We further transform
the penalty model into an equivalent min-max problem and propose an efficient
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm for solving it. The AO algorithm enjoys
low per-iteration complexity and is guaranteed to converge to the stationary
point of the min-max problem. Numerical results show that, compared against the
state-of-the-art CI-based algorithms, the proposed algorithm generally achieves
better bit-error-rate (BER) performance with lower computational cost.

cell cycle of E. coli is one of the least understood events in its life cycle.
Using principles of entropic repulsion between polymer loops confined in a
cylinder, we use Monte carlo simulations to show that the segregation dynamics
is spontaneously enhanced by the adoption of a certain DNA-polymer architecture
as replication progresses. Secondly, the chosen polymer-topology ensures its
self-organization along the cell axis while segregation is in progress, such
that various chromosomal loci get spatially localized. The time evolution of
loci positions quantitatively match the corresponding experimentally reported
results, including observation of the cohesion time and the ter-transition.
Additionally, the contact map generated using our bead-spring model reproduces
the four macro-domains of the experimental Hi-C maps. Lastly, the proposed
mechanism reproduces the observed universal dynamics as the sister loci
separate during segregation.
  It was already hypothesized and expected that SMC proteins, e.g. MukBEF
contribute over and above entropic repulsion between bacterial-DNA
ring-polymers to aid the segregation of daughter DNAs in the E.coli cell cycle.
We propose that cross-links (plausibly induced by SMC proteins) at crucial
positions along the contour is enough to provide sufficient forces for
segregation within reasonable time scales. A mapping between Monte Carlo
diffusive dynamics time scales and real time units helps us use experimentally
relevant numbers for our modeling.

non-local interaction, and (ii) a direct parameter space optimization method

allows programs to assign virtual memory pages to protection domains, and to
change domain access permissions using inexpensive, unprivileged instructions.
Several in-process memory isolation approaches leverage this feature to prevent
untrusted code from accessing sensitive program state and data. Typically,
PKU-based isolation schemes need to be used in conjunction with mitigations
such as CFI because untrusted code, when compromised, can otherwise bypass the
PKU access permissions using unprivileged instructions or operating system
APIs.
  Recently, researchers proposed fully self-contained PKUbased memory isolation
schemes that do not rely on other mitigations. These systems use exploit-proof
call gates to transfer control between trusted and untrusted code, as well as a
sandbox that prevents tampering with the PKU infrastructure from untrusted
code.
  In this paper, we show that these solutions are not complete. We first
develop two proof-of-concept attacks against a state-of-the-art PKU-based
memory isolation scheme. We then present Garmr, a PKU-based sandboxing
framework that can overcome limitations of existing sandboxes. We apply Garmr
to several memory isolation schemes and show that it is practical, efficient

signals into such a latent embedding space that the signals from different
speakers can be precisely separated. Existing methods for speech separation
either transform the speech signals into frequency domain to perform separation
or seek to learn a separable embedding space by constructing a latent domain
based on convolutional filters. While the latter type of methods learning an
embedding space achieves substantial improvement for speech separation, we
argue that the embedding space defined by only one latent domain does not
suffice to provide a thoroughly separable encoding space for speech separation.
In this paper, we propose the Stepwise-Refining Speech Separation Network
(SRSSN), which follows a coarse-to-fine separation framework. It first learns a
1-order latent domain to define an encoding space and thereby performs a rough
separation in the coarse phase. Then the proposed SRSSN learns a new latent
domain along each basis function of the existing latent domain to obtain a
high-order latent domain in the refining phase, which enables our model to
perform a refining separation to achieve a more precise speech separation. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our SRSSN by conducting extensive experiments,
including speech separation in a clean (noise-free) setting on WSJ0-2/3mix
datasets as well as in noisy/reverberant settings on WHAM!/WHAMR! datasets.
Furthermore, we also perform experiments of speech recognition on separated
speech signals by our model to evaluate the performance of speech separation
indirectly.

encoder-decoder framework is dedicated to exploring complex and powerful
instance representations from RGB images, point clouds and categorical shape
priors. For this purpose, the whole framework consists of two main branches,
named Pixelformer and Pointformer. The Pixelformer contains a pyramid
transformer encoder with an all-MLP decoder to extract pixelwise appearance
representations from RGB images, while the Pointformer relies on a cascaded
transformer encoder and an all-MLP decoder to acquire the pointwise geometric
characteristics from point clouds. Then, dense instance representations (i.e.,
correspondence matrix, deformation field) are obtained from a multi-source
aggregation network with shape priors, appearance and geometric information as

correspondence among dense representations, shape priors, and the instance
point clouds. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets

with different values of the gauge parameter are not equivalent for
nonstationary magnetic fields due to different structures of induced electric
fields, whose lines of force are circles for $\alpha=0$ and straight lines for
$\alpha=1$. We derive general formulas for the time-dependent mean values of
the energy and magnetic moment, as well as for their variances, for an
arbitrary function $B(t)$. They are expressed in terms of solutions to the
classical equation of motion $\ddot\vep +\omega_{\alpha}^2(t) \vep=0$, with
$\omega_1=2\omega_0$. Explicit results are found in the cases of the sudden
jump of magnetic field, the parametric resonance, the adiabatic evolution, and
for several specific functions $B(t)$, when solutions can be expressed in terms

gauges, if the evolution is not adiabatic. It appears that the adiabatic
approximation fails when the magnetic field goes to zero. Moreover, the sudden

few estimates for the \textit{the extended symmetrized polydisc}
$\widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$, a family of domains introduced in \cite{pal-roy 4}
and defined in the following way: \begin{align*} \widetilde{\mathbb G}_n :=

|\beta_{n-j}| < {n \choose j} &\text{ for } j=1,\dots, n-1 \Bigg\}.
\end{align*} We then show that these estimates are sharp and provide a Schwarz
lemma for $\Gn$. It is easy to verify that $\mathbb G_n=\widetilde{\mathbb
G}_n$ for $n=1,2$ and that ${\mathbb G}_n \subsetneq \widetilde{\mathbb G}_n$
for $n\geq 3$. As a consequence of the estimates for $\widetilde{\mathbb G_n}$,
we have analogous estimates for $\mathbb G_n$. Since for a point $(s_1,\dots,

$|s_i|$, which is same for $|y_i|$ for any $(y_1,\dots ,y_{n-1},q) \in

$\mathbb G_n$ too. We show that these conditions are necessary and sufficient

investigate semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) where only one source

developed. Also, considering inconsistent goals between generalization and
pseudo-labeling: former prevents overfitting on all source domains while latter
might overfit the unlabeled source domains for high accuracy, we employ a
dual-classifier to independently perform pseudo-labeling and domain
generalization in the training process. When accurate pseudo-labels are
generated for unlabeled source domains, the domain mixup operation is applied
to augment new domains between labeled and unlabeled domains, which is
beneficial for boosting the generalization capability of the model. Extensive

as transform-domain sparsity promotion, have been designed to deal with the
adverse effects of these errors, however, these methods run the risk of biasing
the solution and do not provide information on uncertainty in the image space
and how this uncertainty impacts certain tasks on the image. A systematic
approach is proposed to translate uncertainty due to noise in the data to
confidence intervals of automatically tracked horizons in the image. The
uncertainty is characterized by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and to
assess these uncertainties, samples are drawn from the posterior distribution
of the CNN weights, used to parameterize the image. Compared to traditional
priors, it is argued in the literature that these CNNs introduce a flexible
inductive bias that is a surprisingly good fit for a diverse set of problems.
The method of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics is employed to sample from
the posterior distribution. This method is designed to handle large scale
Bayesian inference problems with computationally expensive forward operators as
in seismic imaging. Aside from offering a robust alternative to maximum a
posteriori estimate that is prone to overfitting, access to these samples allow
us to translate uncertainty in the image, due to noise in the data, to
uncertainty on the tracked horizons. For instance, it admits estimates for the
pointwise standard deviation on the image and for confidence intervals on its

gaps compiled from previous studies, and classify each gap into four different
groups. The classification of the observed gaps allows us to predict the mass
of embedded planets in a consistent manner with the pebble isolation mass. We
find that outer gaps are mostly dust alone, while inner gaps are more likely to
be associated with a gas gap as well. The distribution of such embedded planets
is very different from the architecture of the observed planetary systems,
suggesting that the significant inward migration is required in their
evolution.

stroke lines. Compared with images of real-world scenarios, the simpler

existing learning-based works of image vectorization, we present a new view
that considers an entire manga as a collection of basic primitives ""stroke

vectorization. We train a designed DRL agent to produce the most suitable
sequence of stroke lines, which is constrained to follow the visual feature of
the target manga. Next, the control parameters of strokes are collected to
translated to vector format. To improve our performances on visual quality and
storage size, we further propose an SA reward to generate accurate stokes, and
a pruning mechanism to avoid producing error and redundant strokes.
Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our Mang2Vec can

and it is also frequently encountered in scientific and engineering fields. An
in-depth understanding of the fundamental mechanism of convection heat transfer
in porous media requires efficient and powerful numerical tools. In this paper,
a cascaded lattice Boltzmann (CLB) method for convection heat transfer in
porous media at the representative elementary volume (REV) scale is presented.
In the CLB method, the flow field is solved by an isothermal CLB model with the
D2Q9 lattice based on the generalized non-Darcy model, while the temperature
field is solved by a temperature-based CLB model with the D2Q5 lattice. The key
point is to incorporate the influence of the porous media into the CLB method
by introducing the porosity and heat capacity ratio into the shift matrices.
The effectiveness and practicability of the present method are validated by
numerical simulations of several heat transfer problems in porous media at the
REV scale. It is shown that the present method for convection heat transfer in
porous media is second-order accurate in space. Moreover, in comparison with
the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook lattice Boltzmann method, the present method has
sufficient tunable parameters and possesses better numerical stability.

developed method is examined in the solutions of a novel modified Kursawe

nonlinear characteristics which are difficult to resolve using conventional

multiple operations of a single-condition optimization method for multiple

reducing the number of required function evaluations. An analysis of
aerodynamics performance of airfoils with optimally designed shapes confirms
that multi-condition optimization is indispensable to avoid significant

  in a dual-phase AlCoCrFeNi$_{2.1}$ Eutectic High-Entropy Alloy",,"J. Mat. NanoSci. 2020,7(2)",,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent times,there has been a significant volume of work on Eutectic High
Entropy Alloys (EHEAs) owing to their remarkable castability combined with
excellent mechanical properties,which aids in clearing obstacles for their
technological applications. One of the most common EHEAs,which has been of
enormous interest at present, primarily owing to its solidification and tensile
behavior, is AlCoCrFeNi$_{2.1}$. However,to aim for high-temperature
applications,oxidation behaviour of material is one of the major aspects that
needs to be extensively investigated.To this end,the present work aims to study
the phases evolved during oxidation at elevated temperatures as high as 950 and
1000$^\circ$C in AlCoCrFeNi$_{2.1}$ using XRD and also to determine the rate
law followed for isothermal oxidation of this alloy at 950 and 1000$^\circ$C,in
order to understand the role of Al$_2$O$_3$ phase formed during isothermal
oxidation at 950 and 1000$^\circ$C.

  diagnosis and progression prediction",,,"10.5220/0010600003220328",,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Recent studies on modelling the progression of Alzheimer's disease use a
single modality for their predictions while ignoring the time dimension.
However, the nature of patient data is heterogeneous and time dependent which
requires models that value these factors in order to achieve a reliable
diagnosis, as well as making it possible to track and detect changes in the
progression of patients' condition at an early stage. This article overviews
various categories of models used for Alzheimer's disease prediction with their
respective learning methods, by establishing a comparative study of early
prediction and detection Alzheimer's disease progression. Finally, a robust and
precise detection model is proposed.

  time-constrained and discounted search goods",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Increasing online shoppers have generated enormous amount of data in form of
reviews (text) and sales data. Aggregate reviews in form of rating (stars) have
become noticeable indicators of product quality and vendor performance to
prospective consumers at first sight. Consumers subjected to product discount
deadlines search for ways in which they could evaluate product and vendor
service using a comprehensible benchmark. Considering the effect of time
pressure on consumers, aggregate reviews, known as review valence, become a
viable indicator of product quality. This study investigates how purchase
decisions for new products are affected by past customer aggregate ratings when
a soon-to-expire discount is being offered. We examine the role that a
consumer's attitude towards review valence (RV) plays as an antecedent to that
consumer's reliance on RV in a purchase decision for time-discounted search
goods. Considering review credibility, diagnosticity, and effectiveness as
determinants of consumer attitude in a time-constrained search and purchase
environment, we follow the approach-avoidance conflict theory to examine the
role of review valence and perceived uncertainty in a time-constrained
environment. The data was collected through an online survey and analyzed using
structural equation modelling. This study provides significant implications for
practitioners as they can better understand how review valence can influence a
purchase decision. Empirical analysis includes two contributions: 1. It helps
to understand how consumer attitude toward review valence, when positively
influenced by the determinants, can lead to reliance on review valence, further
influencing purchase decision; 2. Time constrained purchase-related perceived
uncertainty negatively moderates the relationship between consumer attitude and
reliance on review valence.

an essential step towards computer creativity. Generative Pretraining
Transformer 2 (GPT2) is one of the state of the art approaches that have
excellent successes. In this paper, we took the first step to investigate the
power of GPT2 in traditional Vietnamese poetry generation. In the earlier time,
our experiment with base GPT2 was quite good at generating the poem in the
proper template. Though it can learn the patterns, including rhyme and tone
rules, from the training data, like almost all other text generation
approaches, the poems generated still has a topic drift and semantic
inconsistency. To improve the cohesion within the poems, we proposed a new
model SP-GPT2 (semantic poem GPT2) which was built on the top GPT2 model and an
additional loss to constrain context throughout the entire poem. For better
evaluation, we examined the methods by both automatic quantitative evaluation
and human evaluation. Both automatic and human evaluation demonstrated that our
approach can generate poems that have better cohesion without losing the
quality due to additional loss. At the same time, we are the pioneers of this
topic. We released the first computational scoring module for poems generated
in the template containing the style rule dictionary. Additionally, we are the
first to publish a Luc-Bat dataset, including 87609 Luc Bat poems, which is
equivalent to about 2.6 million sentences, combined with about 83579 poems in
other styles was also published for further exploration. The code is available
at https://github.com/fsoft-ailab/Poem-Generator

  Tasks","Workshop on NLP for Conversational AI, EMNLP 2021",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For each goal-oriented dialog task of interest, large amounts of data need to
be collected for end-to-end learning of a neural dialog system. Collecting that
data is a costly and time-consuming process. Instead, we show that we can use
only a small amount of data, supplemented with data from a related dialog task.
Naively learning from related data fails to improve performance as the related
data can be inconsistent with the target task. We describe a meta-learning
based method that selectively learns from the related dialog task data. Our
approach leads to significant accuracy improvements in an example dialog task.

  underground nuclear tests",,,,,"physics.geo-ph physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rate of aftershocks in the sequence initiated by the DPRK underground
tests has been increasing since January 2021. In total, 22 reliable aftershocks
were detected between January 13 and October 1, 2021. Their characteristics are
similar to the aftershocks in one of two clusters: 1) the fifth DPRK (DPRK5)
test (mb(IDC)=5.09) conducted on September 9, 2016, which induced the first
DPRK aftershock in the sequence detected at 1:50:48 UTC on September 11, 2016;
2) the sixth DPRK (DPRK6) explosion (mb(IDC)=6.07), which generates its
aftershock sequence with characteristics significantly different from the
aftershocks in the DPRK5 sequence. The length, intensity, and alternating
character of these sequences suggest specific mechanisms of energy release
likely associated with the interaction of the damaged zones of the DPRK5 and
DPRK6 and the collapse of their cavities with progressive propagation of the
collapsing chimneys to the free surface. According to the depth estimates based
on the moment tensor modelling, the DPRK5 and DPRK6 were conducted at
practically the same depths. The difference in magnitudes suggests that their
damaged zones differ by a factor of 2 or more. The first aftershock of the
DPRK6 (mb(IDC=4.12) 8.5 minutes after the test is evidence of the cavity
collapse and creation of a chimney, which did not reach the surface. The
activity in 2021 indicates that the chimney collapse is not finished yet. One
can expect more aftershocks in the near future, likely ended with the chimney
reaching the free surface.
