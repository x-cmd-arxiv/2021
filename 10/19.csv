This constitutes the first clear evidence for Feynman-scaling violations in
heavy-ion collisions. Such high-energy particle production has been in models
via QCD string interactions, but so far is untested by experiment. One such
model calls this a hadronic accelerator. Studies with a particular heavy-ion
event generator (HIJING) show that photons and mesons exhibit such very
high-energy production in a heavy-ion collision, so {\it QCD accelerator}
appropriately captures the physics associated with such QCD string
interactions. All models other than HIJING used for hadronic interactions in
the study of extensive air showers from cosmic rays either do not include these
QCD string interactions, or have smaller effects from the QCD accelerator.

  permutational symmetry","12 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phase transitions in dissipative quantum systems have been investigated using
various analytical approaches, particularly in the mean-field (MF) limit.
However, analytical results often depend on specific methodologies. For
instance, Keldysh formalism shows that the dissipative transverse Ising (DTI)
model exhibits a discontinuous transition at the upper critical dimension,
$d_c= 3$, whereas the fluctuationless MF approach predicts a continuous
transition in infinite dimensions ($d_\infty$). These two solutions cannot be
reconciled because the MF solutions above $d_c$ should be identical. This
necessitates a numerical verification. However, numerical studies on large
systems may not be feasible because of the exponential increase in
computational complexity as $\mathcal{O}(2^{2N})$ with system size $N$. Here,
we note that because spins can be regarded as being fully connected at
$d_\infty$, the spin indices can be permutation invariant, and the number of
quantum states can be considerably contracted with the computational complexity
$\mathcal{O}(N^3)$. The Lindblad equation is transformed into a dynamic
equation based on the contracted states. Applying the Runge--Kutta algorithm to
the dynamic equation, we obtain all the critical exponents, including the
dynamic exponent $z\approx 0.5$. Moreover, since the DTI model has
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, the hyperscaling relation has the form
$2\beta+\gamma=\nu(d+z)$, we obtain the relation $d_c+z=4$ in the MF limit.
Hence, $d_c\approx 3.5$; thus, the discontinuous transition at $d=3$ cannot be
treated as an MF solution. We conclude that the permutation invariance at
$d_\infty$ can be used effectively to check the validity of an analytic MF
solution in quantum phase transitions.

stroke (AIS). CTP may be performed within the angio suite using flat detector
CT (FDCT) to help reduce patient management time. In order to significantly
improve FDCT perfusion (FDCTP) imaging, data-processing algorithms need to be
able to compensate for the higher levels of noise, slow rotation speed, and a
lower frame rate of current FDCT devices. We performed a realistic simulation
of FDCTP acquisition based on CTP data from seven subjects. We used the time
separation technique (TST) as a model-based approach for FDCTP data processing.
We propose a novel dimension reduction in which we approximate the time
attenuation curves by a linear combination of trigonometric functions. Our goal
was to show that the TST can be used even without prior assumptions on the
shape of the attenuation profiles. We first demonstrated that a trigonometric
basis is suitable for dimension reduction of perfusion data. Using simulated
FDCTP data, we have shown that a trigonometric basis in the TST provided better
results than the classical straightforward processing even with additional
noise. Average correlation coefficients of perfusion maps were improved for
cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume, mean transit time (MTT) maps.
In a moderate noise scenario, the average Pearson's coefficient for the CBF map
was improved using the TST from 0.76 to 0.81. For the MTT map, it was improved
from 0.37 to 0.45. Furthermore, we achieved a total processing time from the
reconstruction of FDCTP data to the generation of perfusion maps of under 5
min. In our study cohort, perfusion maps created from FDCTP data using the TST
with a trigonometric basis showed equivalent perfusion deficits to classic CT
perfusion maps. It follows, that this novel FDCTP technique has potential to
provide fast and accurate FDCTP imaging for AIS patients.

Depending on the parameter values, either an asynchronous regime or periodic
oscillations spontaneously emerge. Numerical simulations are compared with a
mean field model based on a self-consistent Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). The
FPE reproduces quite well the asynchronous dynamics in the homogeneous case by
either assuming a Poissonian or renewal distribution for the incoming spike
trains. An exact self consistent solution for the mean firing rate obtained in
the limit of infinite in-degree allows identifying balanced regimes that can be
either mean- or fluctuation-driven. A low-dimensional reduction of the FPE in
terms of circular cumulants is also considered. Two cumulants suffice to
reproduce the transition scenario observed in the network. The emergence of
periodic collective oscillations is well captured both in the homogeneous and
heterogeneous setups by the mean field models upon tuning either the
connectivity, or the input DC current. In the heterogeneous situation we
analyze also the role of structural heterogeneity.

millisecond timescales, remain unknown. One of the difficulties stems from the
possibility that observed FRBs could be heterogeneous in origin; as some of
them have been observed to repeat, and others have not. Due to limited
observing periods and telescope sensitivities, some bursts may be misclassified
as non-repeaters. Therefore, it is important to clearly distinguish FRBs into
repeaters and non-repeaters, to better understand their origins. In this work,
we classify repeaters and non-repeaters using unsupervised machine learning,
without relying on expensive monitoring observations. We present a repeating
FRB recognition method based on the Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP). The main goals of this work are to: (i) show that the
unsupervised UMAP can classify repeating FRB population without any prior
knowledge about their repetition, (ii) evaluate the assumption that
non-repeating FRBs are contaminated by repeating FRBs, and (iii) recognise the
FRB repeater candidates without monitoring observations and release a
corresponding catalogue. We apply our method to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) database. We found that the
unsupervised UMAP classification provides a repeating FRB completeness of 95
per cent and identifies 188 FRB repeater source candidates from 474
non-repeater sources. This work paves the way to a new classification of
repeaters and non-repeaters based on a single epoch observation of FRBs.

models, which struggle to reproduce both features. We explore if a disk
evolution model, including a dead zone and disk dispersal by X-ray
photoevaporation, can explain the high accretion rates and large gaps (or
cavities) measured in transition disks. We implement a dead zone turbulence
profile and a photoevaporative mass loss profile into numerical simulations of
gas and dust. We perform a population synthesis study of the gas component, and
obtain synthetic images and SED of the dust component through radiative
transfer calculations. This model results in long lived inner disks and fast
dispersing outer disks, that can reproduce both the accretion rates and gap
sizes observed in transition disks. For a dead zone of turbulence $\alpha_{dz}
= 10^{-4}$ and extent $r_{dz}$ = 10 AU, our population synthesis study shows
that $63\%$ of our transition disks are accreting with $\dot{M}_g > 10^{-11}
M_\odot/yr$ after opening a gap. Among those accreting transition disks, half
display accretion rates higher than $5\times10^{-10} M_\odot/yr$ . The dust
component in these disks is distributed in two regions: in a compact inner disk
inside the dead zone, and in a ring at the outer edge of the photoevaporative
gap, which can be located between 20 AU and 100 AU. Our radiative transfer
calculations show that the disk displays an inner disk and an outer ring in the
millimeter continuum, a feature observed in some transition disks. A disk model
considering X-ray photoevaporative dispersal in combination with dead zones can
explain several of the observed properties in transition disks including: the
high accretion rates, the large gaps, and long-lived inner disks at

imaging in vivo, and can be combined with widefield fluorescence imaging by use
of a double-clad fiber. However, it is technically challenging to build a
high-performance miniaturized 2D scanning system with a large field-of-view. In
this paper we demonstrate how a 1D scanning probe, which produces
cross-sectional OCT images (B-scans) and 1D fluorescence T-scans, can be
transformed into a 2D scanning probe by manual scanning along the second axis.
OCT volumes are assembled from the B-scans using speckle decorrelation
measurements to estimate the out-of-plane motion along the manual scan
direction. Motion within the plane of the B-scans is corrected using image
registration by normalized cross correlation. En-face OCT slices and
fluorescence images, corrected for probe motion in 3D, can be displayed in
real-time during the scan. For a B-scan frame rate of 250 Hz, and an OCT
lateral resolution of approximately 20 micrometers, the approach can handle
out-of-plane motion at speeds of up to 4 mm/s.

significant to plan the public charging infrastructure where charging demands
are high. However, it is difficult to predict charging demands before the
actual deployment of EV chargers for lack of operational data, resulting in a
deadlock. A direct idea is to leverage the urban transfer learning paradigm to
learn the knowledge from a source city, then exploit it to predict charging
demands, and meanwhile determine locations and amounts of slow/fast chargers
for charging stations in the target city. However, the demand prediction and
charger planning depend on each other, and it is required to re-train the
prediction model to eliminate the negative transfer between cities for each
varied charger plan, leading to the unacceptable time complexity. To this end,
we propose the concept and an effective solution of Simultaneous Demand
Prediction And Planning (SPAP): discriminative features are extracted from
multi-source data, and fed into an Attention-based Spatial-Temporal City Domain
Adaptation Network (AST-CDAN) for cross-city demand prediction; a novel
Transfer Iterative Optimization (TIO) algorithm is designed for charger
planning by iteratively utilizing AST-CDAN and a charger plan fine-tuning
algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets collected from three
cities in China validate the effectiveness and efficiency of SPAP. Specially,
SPAP improves at most 72.5% revenue compared with the real-world charger
deployment.

of an offline nearest neighbor computation step that can be highly

proposes a generic design of provably secure PUFs, called hybrid locked
PUFs(HLPUFs), providing a practical solution for securing classical PUFs. An
HLPUF uses a classical PUF(CPUF), and encodes the output into non-orthogonal
quantum states to hide the outcomes of the underlying CPUF from any adversary.
Here we introduce a quantum lock to protect the HLPUFs from any general
adversaries. The indistinguishability property of the non-orthogonal quantum
states, together with the quantum lockdown technique prevents the adversary
from accessing the outcome of the CPUFs. Moreover, we show that by exploiting
non-classical properties of quantum states, the HLPUF allows the server to
reuse the challenge-response pairs for further client authentication. This
result provides an efficient solution for running PUF-based client
authentication for an extended period while maintaining a small-sized
challenge-response pairs database on the server side. Later, we support our
theoretical contributions by instantiating the HLPUFs design using accessible

However, registration-based pipelines are time-consuming, thus, limiting their
clinical use. This paper uses deep learning to provide a robust and efficient
deep brain segmentation solution. The method consists of a pre-processing step
to conform all MRI images to the same orientation, followed by a convolutional
neural network using the nnU-Net framework. We use a total of 14 datasets from
both research and clinical collections. Of these, seven were used for training
and validation and seven were retained for independent testing. We trained the
network to segment 30 deep brain structures, as well as a brain mask, using
labels generated from a registration-based approach. We evaluated the
generalizability of the network by performing a leave-one-dataset-out
cross-validation, and extensive testing on external datasets. Furthermore, we
assessed cross-domain transportability by evaluating the results separately on
different domains. We achieved an average DSC of 0.89 $\pm$ 0.04 on the
independent testing datasets when compared to the registration-based gold
standard. On our test system, the computation time decreased from 42 minutes
for a reference registration-based pipeline to 1 minute. Our proposed method is
fast, robust, and generalizes with high reliability. It can be extended to the
segmentation of other brain structures. The method is publicly available on
GitHub, as well as a pip package for convenient usage.

frequency profile is affected by the expansion history of the post-inflationary
universe. Our results are applicable as long as the equation of state of the
universe can be taken as constant during the period in which the gravitational
waves are produced, and we compute the spectrum of gravitational waves induced
by both sharp and resonant features, associated with oscillations in $k$ and
$\log(k)$, respectively. For resonant features, the frequencies of the
oscillatory contributions to the gravitational wave spectrum are unaffected by
the equation of state, but not their relative amplitudes, allowing one to
extract information about both inflationary physics and the post-inflationary
expansion history from the oscillatory pattern. For sharp features we find that
the gravitational wave spectrum only exhibits prominent modulations as long as
the propagation speed of density fluctuations is $c_s<1$, with a frequency
larger by a factor $c_s^{-1}$ than that of the scalar power spectrum. We find
that the stiffer the equation of state, the larger the relative amplitude of
the oscillations. In particular, a relative amplitude significantly higher than
$20 \%$ is not achievable for the 'standard' case of radiation domination, and
would be a smoking-gun signal of both nontrivial inflationary dynamics on small
scales, and a post-inflationary universe not dominated by radiation.

module of the standard perception-planning robot autonomy pipeline, including
detection, tracking, prediction of other agents' trajectories, and ego-agent
trajectory planning. Nevertheless, there has been less attention given to the
principled integration of these components, particularly in terms of the
characterization and mitigation of cascading errors. This paper addresses the
problem of cascading errors by focusing on the coupling between the tracking
and prediction modules. First, by using state-of-the-art tracking and
prediction tools, we conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of how
severely errors stemming from tracking can impact prediction performance. On
the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, we find that predictions consuming tracked
trajectories as inputs (the typical case in practice) can experience a
significant (even order of magnitude) drop in performance in comparison to the
idealized setting where ground truth past trajectories are used as inputs. To
address this issue, we propose a multi-hypothesis tracking and prediction
framework. Rather than relying on a single set of tracking results for
prediction, our framework simultaneously reasons about multiple sets of
tracking results, thereby increasing the likelihood of including accurate
tracking results as inputs to prediction. We show that this framework improves
overall prediction performance over the standard single-hypothesis
tracking-prediction pipeline by up to 34.2% on the nuScenes dataset, with even
more significant improvements (up to ~70%) when restricting the evaluation to
challenging scenarios involving identity switches and fragments -- all with an
acceptable computation overhead.

image fusion. Therefore, we propose a new image fusion technique that extends
DIP to fusion tasks formulated as inverse problems. Additionally, we apply a
multi-channel approach to enhance DIP's effect further. The evaluation is
conducted with several commonly used image fusion assessment metrics. The
results are compared with state-of-the-art image fusion methods. Our method
outperforms these techniques for a range of metrics. In particular, it is shown
to provide the best objective results for most metrics when applied to medical
images.

features of quantum effects, such as tunneling evolution, that are harder to
reveal in standard treatments based on wave functions of stationary states.
Here, these methods are applied to an oscillating universe model introduced
recently. Our quasiclassical treatment correctly describes several expected
features of tunneling states, in particular just before and after tunneling
into a trapped region where a model universe may oscillate through many cycles
of collapse and expansion. As a new result, the oscillating dynamics is found
to be much less regular than in the classical description, revealing a
succession of cycles with varying maximal volume even when the matter
ingredients and their parameters do not change.

a core task in physics data analyses. Among recent deep learning methods,
so-called conditional invertible neural networks provide an elegant approach
owing to their probability-preserving bijective mapping properties. They enable
training the parameter-observation correspondence in one mapping direction and
evaluating the parameter posterior distributions in the reverse direction.
Here, we study the inference of cosmic-ray source properties from cosmic-ray
observations on Earth using extensive astrophysical simulations. We compare the
performance of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs) with the
frequently used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. While cINNs are trained
to directly predict the parameters' posterior distributions, the MCMC method
extracts the posterior distributions through a likelihood function that matches
simulations with observations. Overall, we find good agreement between the
physics parameters derived by the two different methods. As a result of its
computational efficiency, the cINN method allows for a swift assessment of
inference quality.

  To achieve these result, we use action completed symplectic cohomology groups

  Methodology for Removing Stylistic Indicators in Text",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CL cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With Internet users constantly leaving a trail of text, whether through
blogs, emails, or social media posts, the ability to write and protest
anonymously is being eroded because artificial intelligence, when given a
sample of previous work, can match text with its author out of hundreds of
possible candidates. Existing approaches to authorship anonymization, also
known as authorship obfuscation, often focus on protecting binary demographic
attributes rather than identity as a whole. Even those that do focus on
obfuscating identity require manual feedback, lose the coherence of the
original sentence, or only perform well given a limited subset of authors. In
this paper, we develop a new approach to authorship anonymization by
constructing a generative adversarial network that protects identity and
optimizes for three different losses corresponding to anonymity, fluency, and
content preservation. Our fully automatic method achieves comparable results to
other methods in terms of content preservation and fluency, but greatly
outperforms baselines in regards to anonymization. Moreover, our approach is
able to generalize well to an open-set context and anonymize sentences from
authors it has not encountered before.

Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) - Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover,
inspired by the realizations of spherical bubble traps for ultracold atoms in
microgravity. The derivation follows the BCS-Leggett theory to obtain the gap
and number equations. The BCS-BEC crossover can be induced by tuning the
interaction, and the properly normalized gap and chemical potential exhibit
universal behavior regardless of the planar or spherical geometry.
Nevertheless, the spherical-shell geometry introduces another way of inducing
the crossover by the curvature. The curvature-induced BCS-BEC crossover is made
possible by fixing the particle number and interaction strength while shrinking
the sphere, causing a reduction to the ratio of the pairing and kinetic
energies and pushing the system towards the BCS limit. The saturation of the
superfluid density further confirms the ground state is a Fermi superfluid.

in two dimensions the Villain spin model exhibits non-summable decay of
correlations at any temperature at which the dual integer-restricted Gaussian
field exhibits depinning. For the latter, we devise a new monotonicity argument
through which the recent alternative proof by Lammers of the existence of a
depinning transition in two-dimensional graphs of degree three, is extended to
all doubly-periodic graphs, in particular to $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Essential use is
made of the inequality of Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz, which allows also an
alternative (to absolute-value FKG) proof of convergence of the
height-function's distribution in the infinite-volume limit. Similar results
are established for the $XY$ spin model and its dual Bessel random height
function. Taken together these statements yield a new perspective on the

complete a new proof of depinning in two-dimensional integer-valued height

The high intensity of this field relative to that inferred from inner solar

substantial mass loss from the disk associated with a major disk substructure,

suggests interpolating estimators -- the ones that achieve zero training error
-- may not necessarily be harmful. This paper pursues theoretical understanding
for an important type of interpolators: the minimum $\ell_{1}$-norm
interpolator, which is motivated by the observation that several learning
algorithms favor low $\ell_1$-norm solutions in the over-parameterized regime.
Concretely, we consider the noisy sparse regression model under Gaussian
design, focusing on linear sparsity and high-dimensional asymptotics (so that
both the number of features and the sparsity level scale proportionally with
the sample size).
  We observe, and provide rigorous theoretical justification for, a curious
multi-descent phenomenon; that is, the generalization risk of the minimum
$\ell_1$-norm interpolator undergoes multiple (and possibly more than two)
phases of descent and ascent as one increases the model capacity. This
phenomenon stems from the special structure of the minimum $\ell_1$-norm
interpolator as well as the delicate interplay between the over-parameterized
ratio and the sparsity, thus unveiling a fundamental distinction in geometry
from the minimum $\ell_2$-norm interpolator. Our finding is built upon an exact
characterization of the risk behavior, which is governed by a system of two
non-linear equations with two unknowns.

points, many applications require robustness even in the face of unexpected
perturbations in the input, changes in the domain, or other sources of
distribution shift. We study the problem of test time robustification, i.e.,
using the test input to improve model robustness. Recent prior works have
proposed methods for test time adaptation, however, they each introduce
additional assumptions, such as access to multiple test points, that prevent
widespread adoption. In this work, we aim to study and devise methods that make
no assumptions about the model training process and are broadly applicable at
test time. We propose a simple approach that can be used in any test setting
where the model is probabilistic and adaptable: when presented with a test
example, perform different data augmentations on the data point, and then adapt
(all of) the model parameters by minimizing the entropy of the model's average,
or marginal, output distribution across the augmentations. Intuitively, this
objective encourages the model to make the same prediction across different
augmentations, thus enforcing the invariances encoded in these augmentations,
while also maintaining confidence in its predictions. In our experiments, we
evaluate two baseline ResNet models, two robust ResNet-50 models, and a robust
vision transformer model, and we demonstrate that this approach achieves
accuracy gains of 1-8\% over standard model evaluation and also generally
outperforms prior augmentation and adaptation strategies. For the setting in
which only one test point is available, we achieve state-of-the-art results on
the ImageNet-C, ImageNet-R, and, among ResNet-50 models, ImageNet-A

we analyze HRL in the meta-RL setting, where a learner learns latent
hierarchical structure during meta-training for use in a downstream task. We
consider a tabular setting where natural hierarchical structure is embedded in
the transition dynamics. Analogous to supervised meta-learning theory, we
provide ""diversity conditions"" which, together with a tractable optimism-based
algorithm, guarantee sample-efficient recovery of this natural hierarchy.
Furthermore, we provide regret bounds on a learner using the recovered

well-known ""supervised finetuning"". Given a pretrained model and small-scale
unlabeled target data, unsupervised finetuning is to adapt the representation
pretrained from the source domain to the target domain so that better transfer
performance can be obtained. This problem is more challenging than the
supervised counterpart, as the low data density in the small-scale target data
is not friendly for unsupervised learning, leading to the damage of the
pretrained representation and poor representation in the target domain. In this
paper, we find the source data is crucial when shifting the finetuning paradigm
from supervise to unsupervise, and propose two simple and effective strategies
to combine source and target data into unsupervised finetuning: ""sparse source
data replaying"", and ""data mixing"". The motivation of the former strategy is to
add a small portion of source data back to occupy their pretrained
representation space and help push the target data to reside in a smaller
compact space; and the motivation of the latter strategy is to increase the
data density and help learn more compact representation. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ``unsupervised finetuning'' strategy, we conduct
extensive experiments on multiple different target datasets, which show better
transfer performance than the naive strategy.

been greatly aided by our ability to construct lattice models realizing these
states. In contrast, a systematic approach to constructing models that realize
quantum critical points between SPT phases is lacking, particularly in
dimension $d>1$. Here, we show how the recently introduced notion of the pivot
Hamiltonian -- generating rotations between SPT phases -- facilitates such a
construction. We demonstrate this approach by constructing a spin model on the
triangular lattice, which is midway between a trivial and SPT phase. The pivot
Hamiltonian generates a $U(1)$ pivot symmetry which helps to stabilize a direct
SPT transition. The sign-problem free nature of the model -- with an additional
Ising interaction preserving the pivot symmetry -- allows us to obtain the
phase diagram using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find evidence for a
direct transition between trivial and SPT phases that is consistent with a
deconfined quantum critical point with emergent $SO(5)$ symmetry. The known
anomaly of the latter is made possible by the non-local nature of the $U(1)$
pivot symmetry. Interestingly, the pivot Hamiltonian generating this symmetry
is nothing other than the staggered Baxter-Wu three-spin interaction. This work
illustrates the importance of $U(1)$ pivot symmetries and proposes how to
generally construct sign-problem-free lattice models of SPT transitions with
such anomalous symmetry groups for other lattices and dimensions.

${}^4_\Lambda \rm{H}$ are presented in different centrality and rapidity
intervals. It is observed that the shape of the rapidity distribution of
${}^4_\Lambda \rm{H}$ is different for 0--10\% and 10--50\% centrality
collisions. Thermal model calculations, using the canonical ensemble for
strangeness, describes the ${}^3_\Lambda \rm{H}$ yield well, while
underestimating the ${}^4_\Lambda \rm{H}$ yield. Transport models, combining
baryonic mean-field and coalescence (JAM) or utilizing dynamical cluster
formation via baryonic interactions (PHQMD) for light nuclei and hypernuclei
production, approximately describe the measured ${}^3_\Lambda \rm{H}$ and
${}^4_\Lambda \rm{H}$ yields. Our measurements provide means to precisely
assess our understanding of the fundamental baryonic interactions with strange

involving hyperons, such as the interior of neutron stars or exotic
hypernuclei.

two problems: discovering new goals and learning to reliably achieve them. We
introduce Latent Explorer Achiever (LEXA), a unified solution to these that
learns a world model from image inputs and uses it to train an explorer and an
achiever policy from imagined rollouts. Unlike prior methods that explore by
reaching previously visited states, the explorer plans to discover unseen
surprising states through foresight, which are then used as diverse targets for
the achiever to practice. After the unsupervised phase, LEXA solves tasks
specified as goal images zero-shot without any additional learning. LEXA
substantially outperforms previous approaches to unsupervised goal-reaching,
both on prior benchmarks and on a new challenging benchmark with a total of 40
test tasks spanning across four standard robotic manipulation and locomotion
domains. LEXA further achieves goals that require interacting with multiple
objects in sequence. Finally, to demonstrate the scalability and generality of
LEXA, we train a single general agent across four distinct environments. Code

the presence of low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSBGs) with apparently
""exotic"" properties, making it a region of high interest for the detection of
new objects. We used public deep photometric data from DECaLS to carry out a
comprehensive search for LSBGs over a wide region of 6x6 degrees, equivalent to
2x2 Mpc at the distance of NGC1052. We detected 42 LSBGs with r_e > 5 arcsec
and mu_g(0) > 24 mag/arcsec2, of which 20 are previously undetected objects.
RCP32 stands out with extreme properties: r_e = 23.0 arcsec and mu_g_eff = 28.6
mag/arcsec2, making it one of the lowest surface brightness galaxies ever
detected through integrated photometry, located at just 10 arcmin from the
extensively studied NGC1052-DF2. We explored the presence of GCs in the LSBGs.
We marginally detected a GC system in RCP32, and argue that this LSBG is of
great interest for follow-up observations given its extremely low baryon
density. After analyzing the distribution of galaxies with available
spectroscopy, we identified a large-scale structure of approximately 1 Mpc that
is well isolated in redshift space and centered on NGC1052. The spatial
correlation analysis between the LSBGs and this large-scale structure suggests
their association. However, when exploring the distribution of effective
radius, we find an overpopulation of large LSBGs (r_e > 15 arcsec) located
close to the line of sight of NGC1052. We argue that this is suggestive of a
substructure with similar radial velocity in sight projection, but at a closer
distance, to which some of these apparently larger LSBGs could be associated.
However. possible effects derived from tidal interactions are worthy of further
study. Our work expands the catalog of LSBGs with new interesting objects and
provides a detailed environmental context for the study of LSBGs in this
region.

whether the experimentally measured 2D resistivity as a function of carrier
density is consistent (or not) with an underlying spontaneous

does not directly measure the change in the Fermi surface resulting from the
valley polarization transition, but infers such a transition indirectly through
transport measurements. We validate the experimental claim, showing that indeed
the observed sudden change in the 2D resistivity is quantitatively consistent
with a sudden change in the valley polarization from 2 to 1 at the critical

be canceled by anomaly inflow from a bulk theory in one higher dimension; the
corresponding bulk is therefore a non-trivial subsystem symmetry protected

time-reversal symmetry. For each example we describe the boundary anomaly, and
present classical continuum actions for the corresponding bulk SSPT phases,

tidal stripping of galaxies with very high-mass
(m$_{\rm{star}}=5.4\times10^4$~M$_\odot$/h) and high-spatial resolution (10
pc/h), in a fully cosmological context, using an efficient and fast technique.
The technique works by replacing multiple low-resolution DM halos in the base
cosmological simulation with high-resolution models, including a DM halo and
stellar disk. We apply the method to follow the hierarchical build-up of a
cluster since redshift $\sim8$ to now, through the hierarchical accretion of
galaxies, individually or in substructures such as galaxy groups. We find we
can successfully reproduce the observed total stellar masses of observed
clusters since redshift $\sim$1. The high resolution allows us to accurately
resolve the tidal stripping process and well describe the formation of
ultra-low surface brightness features in the cluster ($\mu_{V}<32$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$) such as the intracluster light (ICL), shells and tidal streams.
We measure the evolution of the fraction of light in the ICL and brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG) using several different methods. While their broad
response to the cluster mass growth history is similar, the methods show
systematic differences, meaning we must be careful when comparing studies that
use distinct methods. The GRT represents a powerful new tool for studying tidal
effects on galaxies and exploring the formation channels of the ICL in a fully
cosmological context and with large samples of simulated groups and clusters.

CFIS to confirm the presence of multiple point sources with similar colour of
$u-r$, via convolution of the Laplacian of the point spread function. Requiring
similar-colour point sources with flux ratios less than 2.5 mag in $r$-band,
reduces the number of candidates from 256314 to 7815. After visual inspection
we obtain 30 high-grade candidates, and prioritise spectroscopic follow-up for
those showing signs of a lensing galaxy upon subtraction of the point sources.
We obtain long-slit spectra for 18 candidates with ALFOSC on the 2.56-m Nordic
Optical Telescope (NOT), confirming five new doubly lensed quasars with
$1.21<z<3.36$ and angular separations from 0.8'' to 2.5''. One additional
system is a probable lensed quasar based on the CFIS imaging and existing SDSS
spectrum. We further classify six objects as nearly identical quasars -- still
possible lenses but without the detection of a lensing galaxy. Given our
recovery rate ($83\%$) of existing optically bright lenses within the CFIS
footprint, we expect that a similar strategy, coupled with $u-r$
colour-selection from CFIS alone, will provide an efficient and complete
discovery of small-separation lensed quasars of source redshifts below $z=2.7$
within the CFIS $r$-band magnitude limit of 24.1 mag.

galaxies. However, environmental effects beyond the virial radius of haloes
($\gtrsim$ 1 Mpc) are less evident. An example is the debated correlation
between colour or star formation in central galaxies and neighbour galaxies in
adjacent haloes at large separations of several Mpc, referred to as two-halo
galactic conformity. We use two galaxy catalogues generated from different
versions of the semi-analytic model SAG applied to the MDPL2 cosmological
simulation and the IllustrisTNG300 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to
study the two-halo conformity by measuring the quenched fraction of
neighbouring galaxies as a function of the real-space distance from central
galaxies. We find that low-mass central galaxies in the vicinity of massive
systems ($M_{\rm 200c}$ $\geq$ 10$^{13}$ $h^{-1}~\rm M_{\odot}$) out to 5
$h^{-1}$ Mpc are preferentially quenched compared to other central galaxies at
fixed stellar mass $M_{\star}$ or fixed host halo mass $M_{\rm 200c}$ at $z$ ~
0. In all the galaxies catalogues is consistent that the low-mass ($M_{\star} <
10^{10}$ $h^{-1}~\rm M_{\odot}$ or $M_{\rm 200c} < 10^{11.8}$ $h^{-1}~\rm
M_{\odot}$) central galaxies in the vicinity of clusters and, especially,
groups of galaxies mostly produce the two-halo galactic conformity. On average,
the quenched low-mass central galaxies are much closer to massive haloes than
star-forming central galaxies of the same mass (by a factor of ~5). Our results
agree with other works regarding the environmental influence of massive haloes
that can extend beyond the virial radius and affect nearby low-mass central
galaxies.

redshift of both the lens and the source galaxy. Traditionally, spectroscopic
redshifts are used for this purpose. Upcoming surveys, however, will lead to
the discovery of $\sim10^5$ strong lenses, and it will be very difficult to
obtain spectroscopic redshifts for most of them. Photometric redshift
measurements will also be very challenging, due to the blending between lens
and source light.
  Aims. The goal of this work is to demonstrate how to carry out an inference
of the structural properties of the galaxy population from the analysis of a
set of strong lenses with no individual source redshift measurements, and to
assess the loss in precision compared to the case in which spectroscopic
redshifts are available.
  Methods. Building on the formalism introduced in Paper III, I developed a
method that allows to carry out a statistical strong lensing inference while
marginalising over the source redshifts. This method, which relies on the
knowledge of the properties of the unlensed background source population and of
the selection function of the survey, generalises an approach known as
photogeometric redshift, originally introduced by the Strong Lensing Legacy
Survey collaboration. I tested the method on simulated data consisting of a
subset of 137 strong lenses that is complete above a cut in observational
space.
  Results. The method recovers the properties of the galaxy population, with a
precision that is comparable to that attainable in the case in which individual
source redshifts are known.
  Conclusions. The photogeometric redshift method is a viable approach for the
analysis of large sets of strong lenses, provided that the background source
population properties and lens selection function are well-known.

means of secure communication and distributed quantum computing. However,
transducing quantum signals between these disparate regimes of the
electromagnetic spectrum remains an outstanding goal, and interfacing
superconducting qubits with electro-optic transducers presents significant
challenges due to the deleterious effects of optical photons on
superconductors. Moreover, many remote entanglement protocols require multiple
qubit gates both preceding and following the upconversion of the quantum state,
and thus an ideal transducer should leave the state of the qubit unchanged:
more precisely, the backaction from the transducer on the qubit should be
minimal. Here we demonstrate non-destructive optical readout of a
superconducting transmon qubit via a continuously operated electro-optic
transducer. The modular nature of the transducer and circuit QED system used in
this work enable complete isolation of the qubit from optical photons, and the
backaction on the qubit from the transducer is less than that imparted by

gravitational-wave (GW) sources for LIGO, VIRGO, and KAGRA. The GWs may be
generated by stellar-mass black hole (BH) or neutron star mergers following
gravitational bremsstrahlung, dynamical scattering encounters, Kozai-Lidov type
oscillations driven by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), or
gas-assisted mergers if present. In this paper, we examine a smoking gun
signature to identify sources in GNs: the GWs scattered by the central SMBH.
This produces a secondary signal, an astrophysical GW echo, which has a very
similar time-frequency evolution as the primary signal but arrives after a time
delay. We determine the amplitude and time-delay distribution of the GW echo as
a function of source distance from the SMBH. Between $\sim10\%-90\%$ of the
detectable echoes arrive within $\sim(1-100)M_6\,\mathrm{sec}$ after the
primary GW for sources between $10-10^4$ Schwarzschild radius, where
$M_6=M_{\rm SMBH,z}/(10^6\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot})$, and $M_{\rm SMBH,z}$ is the
observer-frame SMBH mass. The echo arrival times are systematically longer for
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) primary GWs, where the GW echo rays are
scattered at large deflection angles. In particular, $\sim10\%-90\%$ of the
distribution is shifted to $\sim(5-1800)M_6\,\mathrm{sec}$ for sources, where
the lower limit of echo detection is $0.02$ of the primary signal amplitude. We
find that $\sim5\%-30\%$ ($\sim1\%-7\%$) of GW sources have an echo amplitude
larger than $0.2-0.05$ times the amplitude of the primary signal if the source

the varying magnetic field splits Landau levels of electrons with zero angular

can split the levels between positive and negative angular momenta. Exploring
Landau quantization in non-uniform magnetic fields is a unique venture on its
own and has interdisciplinary implications in the fields ranging from condensed
matter to astrophysics to quantum information. As examples, we show magnetized
white dwarfs, with varying magnetic fields, involved simultaneously with
Lorentz force and Landau quantization affecting the underlying degenerate

sizeable point-spread function of eROSITA, high-redshift clusters of galaxies
or compact nearby groups hosting bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be
misclassified as point sources by the source detection algorithms. A total of
346 galaxy clusters and groups in the redshift range of 0.1<z<1.3 were
identified based on their red sequence in the point source catalog. We examine
the multiwavelength properties of these clusters and groups to understand the
potential biases in our selection process and the completeness of the
extent-selected sample. The majority of the clusters and groups in the point
source sample are indeed underluminous and compact compared to the
extent-selected sample. Their faint X-ray emission, well below the flux limit
of the extent-selected eFEDS clusters, and their compact X-ray emission are
likely to be the main reason for this misclassification. In the sample, we
confirm that 10% of the sources host AGN in their brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) through optical spectroscopy and visual inspection. By studying their
X-ray, optical, infrared, and radio properties, we establish a method for
identifying clusters and groups that host AGN in their BCGs. We successfully

the ongoing interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar material or that
the star might be going through an eruptive phase five years after the luminous

Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) Alhambra Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera
(ALFOSC) spectra and images unveil in unprecedented detail the high-ionization
structure of NGC 6905. The high-quality spectra of HD 193949 allowed us to
detect more than 20 WR features including the characteristic O-bump, blue bump
and red bump, which suggests a spectral type no later than a [WO2]-subtype.
Moreover we detect the Ne VII and Ne VIII broad emission lines, rendering HD
193949 yet another CSPN with $T_\mathrm{eff}\lesssim150$ kK exhibiting such
stellar emission lines. We studied the physical properties ($T_\mathrm{e}$ and
$n_\mathrm{e}$) and chemical abundances of different regions within NGC 6905
including its low-ionization clumps; abundances are found to be homogeneous. We
used the PoWR stellar atmosphere code to model the spectrum of HD 193949, which
is afterwards used in a photoionization model performed with Cloudy that
reproduces the nebular and dust properties for a total mass in the 0.31-0.47
M$_{\odot}$ range and a mass of C-rich dust of $\sim$2 $\times10^{-3}$
M$_{\odot}$. Adopting a current stellar mass of 0.6 M$_{\odot}$, our model
suggests an initial mass $\sim$1 M$_\odot$ for HD 193949, consistent with the
observations.

calibrated multi-view 3D pose estimation. But the performance of 2D pose
detectors suffers from challenging situations such as occlusions and oblique
viewing angles. To address these challenges, previous works derive
point-to-point correspondences between different views from epipolar geometry
and utilize the correspondences to merge prediction heatmaps or feature
representations. Instead of post-prediction merge/calibration, here we
introduce a transformer framework for multi-view 3D pose estimation, aiming at
directly improving individual 2D predictors by integrating information from
different views. Inspired by previous multi-modal transformers, we design a
unified transformer architecture, named TransFusion, to fuse cues from both
current views and neighboring views. Moreover, we propose the concept of
epipolar field to encode 3D positional information into the transformer model.
The 3D position encoding guided by the epipolar field provides an efficient way
of encoding correspondences between pixels of different views. Experiments on
Human 3.6M and Ski-Pose show that our method is more efficient and has
consistent improvements compared to other fusion methods. Specifically, we
achieve 25.8 mm MPJPE on Human 3.6M with only 5M parameters on 256 x 256

any Bayesian statistical analysis. It is viewed positively by some as it
allows, among others, to quantitatively incorporate expert opinion about model
parameters. It is viewed negatively by others because it sets the stage for
subjectivity in statistical analysis. Certainly, it creates problems when the
inference is skewed due to a conflict with the data collected. According to the
theory of conflict resolution (O'Hagan and Pericchi, 2012), a solution to such
problems is to diminish the impact of conflicting prior information, yielding
inference consistent with the data. This is typically achieved by using
heavy-tailed priors. We study both theoretically and numerically the efficacy
of such a solution in regression where the prior information about the
coefficients takes the form of a product of density functions with known
location and scale parameters. We study functions with regularly-varying tails
(Student distributions), log-regularly-varying tails (as introduced in
Desgagn\'e (2015)), and propose functions with slower tail decays that allow to
resolve any conflict that can happen under that regression framework,
contrarily to the two previous types of functions. The code to reproduce all

Attackers piece together short sequences of instructions in otherwise benign
code to carry out malicious actions. Eliminating these reusable code snippets,
known as gadgets, has become one of the prime concerns of attack surface
reduction. The aim is to break these chains of gadgets, thereby making such
code reuse attacks impossible or substantially less common. Previous work on
attack surface reduction has typically tried to eliminate such attacks by
subsetting the application, e.g. via user-specified inputs, configurations, or
features, or by focusing on third-party libraries to achieve high gadget
reductions with minimal interference to the application.
  In this work we present a general, whole-program attack surface reduction
technique called OCA that significantly reduces gadgets and has minor
performance degradation. OCA requires no user inputs and leaves all features
intact. OCA identifies specific program points and through analysis determines
key function sets to enable/disable at runtime. The runtime system, thus,
controls the set of enabled functions during execution, thereby significantly
reducing the set of active gadgets an attacker can use, and by extension,
cutting down the set of active gadget chains dramatically. On SPEC CPU 2017,
our framework achieves 73.2% total gadget reduction with only 4% average
slowdown. On 10 GNU coreutils applications, it achieves 87.2% reduction. On the
nginx server it achieves 80.3% reduction with 2% slowdown. We also provide a
gadget chain-breaking study across all applications, and show that our
framework breaks the shell-spawning chain in all cases.

the NI-PS-V condition, we develop an augmented Lagrangian method to match the
density matrix blocks without referring to the Aufbau principle. Numerical
results for 2D Hubbard and hydrogen model systems indicate that in some
challenging scenarios, the relaxation of the Aufbau principle directly leads to
exact matching of the density matrix blocks, which also yields improved

initial idea by Steven Weinberg, the construction builds on an interacting
fixed point of the theories renormalization group (RG) flow. In this work we
use the Wetterich equation for the effective average action to investigate the
RG flow of gravity supplemented by a real scalar field. We give a
non-perturbative proof that the subspace of interactions respecting the global
shift-symmetry of the scalar kinetic term is closed under RG transformations.
Subsequently, we compute the beta functions in an approximation comprising the
EinsteinHilbert action supplemented by the shift-symmetric quartic scalar
self-interaction and the two lowest order shift-symmetric interactions coupling
scalar-bilinears to the spacetime curvature. The computation utilizes the
background field method with an arbitrary background, demonstrating that the
results are manifestly background independent. Our beta functions exhibit an
interacting fixed point suitable for Asymptotic Safety, where all matter
interactions are non-vanishing. The presence of this fixed point is rooted in
the interplay of the matter couplings which our work tracks for the first time.

collection is challenging for Indian languages, because they are syntactically
and morphologically diverse, as well as different from resource-rich languages
like English. Despite recent interest in deep generative models for Indian
languages, relation classification is still not well served by public data
sets. In response, we present IndoRE, a dataset with 21K entity and relation
tagged gold sentences in three Indian languages, plus English. We start with a
multilingual BERT (mBERT) based system that captures entity span positions and
type information and provides competitive monolingual relation classification.
Using this system, we explore and compare transfer mechanisms between
languages. In particular, we study the accuracy efficiency tradeoff between
expensive gold instances vs. translated and aligned 'silver' instances. We
release the dataset for future research.

continuing to spread at a drastic scale. Out of the numerous steps taken to
control the spread of the virus, social distancing has been a crucial and
effective practice. However, recent reports of social distancing violations
suggest the need for non-intrusive detection techniques to ensure safety in
public spaces. In this paper, a real-time detection model is proposed to
identify handshake interactions in a range of realistic scenarios with multiple
people in the scene and also detect multiple interactions in a single frame.
This is the first work that performs dyadic interaction localization in a
multi-person setting. The efficacy of the proposed model was evaluated across
two different datasets on more than 3200 frames, thus enabling a robust
localization model in different environments. The proposed model is the first
dyadic interaction localizer in a multi-person setting, which enables it to be
used in public spaces to identify handshake interactions and thereby identify
and mitigate COVID-19 transmission.

wide range of material properties and applications. Recently, there has been
considerable interest in the development of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
(RIXS) as a tool for measuring electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions. Here, we
demonstrate the ability of RIXS to probe the interaction between phonons and
specific electronic states both near to, and away from, the Fermi level. We
performed carbon $K$-edge RIXS measurements on graphite, tuning the incident
x-ray energy to separately probe the interactions of the $\pi^*$ and $\sigma^*$
electronic states. Our high-resolution data reveals detailed structure in the
multi-phonon RIXS features that directly encodes the momentum dependence of the
e-ph interaction strength. We develop a Green's-function method to model this
structure, which naturally accounts for the phonon and interaction-strength
dispersions, as well as the mixing of phonon momenta in the intermediate state.
This model shows that the differences between the spectra can be fully
explained by contrasting trends of the e-ph interaction through the Brillouin
zone, being concentrated at the $\Gamma$ and $K$ points for the $\pi^*$ states,
while being significant at all momenta for the $\sigma^*$ states. Our results
advance the interpretation of phonon excitations in RIXS, and extend its
applicability as a probe of e-ph interactions to a new range of
out-of-equilibrium situations.

layers. Recent work explores using such layers for neural machine translation
(NMT), to adapt pre-trained models to new domains or language pairs, training
only a small set of parameters for each new setting (language pair or domain).
In this work we study the compositionality of language and domain adapters in
the context of Machine Translation. We aim to study, 1) parameter-efficient
adaptation to multiple domains and languages simultaneously (full-resource
scenario) and 2) cross-lingual transfer in domains where parallel data is
unavailable for certain language pairs (partial-resource scenario). We find
that in the partial resource scenario a naive combination of domain-specific
and language-specific adapters often results in `catastrophic forgetting' of
the missing languages. We study other ways to combine the adapters to alleviate
this issue and maximize cross-lingual transfer. With our best adapter
combinations, we obtain improvements of 3-4 BLEU on average for source
languages that do not have in-domain data. For target languages without
in-domain data, we achieve a similar improvement by combining adapters with
back-translation. Supplementary material is available at

resonance. The inner, Neptune-class planet (TOI-216b) is near 0.12 au (orbital
period $P_{\rm b} \simeq 17$ d) and has a substantial orbital eccentricity
($e_{\rm b} \simeq 0.16$), and large libration amplitude ($A_\psi \simeq
60^\circ$) in the resonance. The outer planet (TOI-216c) is a gas giant on a
nearly circular orbit. We carry out $N$-body simulations of planet migration in
a protoplanetary gas disk to explain the orbital configuration of TOI-216
planets. We find that TOI-216b's migration must have been halted near its
current orbital radius to allow for a convergent migration of the two planets
into the resonance. For the inferred damping-to-migration timescale ratio
$\tau_e/\tau_a \simeq 0.02$, overstable librations in the resonance lead to a
limit cycle with $A_\psi \simeq 80^\circ$ and $e_{\rm b}<0.1$. The system could
have remained in this configuration for the greater part of the protoplanetary
disk lifetime. If the gas disk was removed from inside out, this would have
reduced the libration amplitude to $A_\psi \simeq 60^\circ$ and boosted $e_{\rm
b}$ via the resonant interaction with TOI-216c. Our results suggest a
relatively fast inner disk removal ($\sim 10^5$ yr). Another means of
explaining the large libration amplitude is stochastic stirring from a
(turbulent) gas disk. For that to work, overstable librations would need to be
suppressed, $\tau_e/\tau_a \simeq 0.05$, and very strong turbulent stirring (or
some other source of large stochastic forcing) would need to overcome the
damping effects of gas. Hydrodynamical simulations can be performed to test
these models.

say, you exchange north's hand with east. This permutation invariance property,
for certain permutations at input and output layers, is central to the
correctness and robustness of these networks.
  This paper proposes a sound, abstraction-based technique to establish
permutation invariance in DNNs with ReLU as the activation function. The
technique computes an over-approximation of the reachable states, and an
under-approximation of the safe states, and propagates this information across

useful tie-class analysis, that we introduce for forward propagation, and a
scalable 2-polytope under-approximation method that escapes the exponential
blow-up in the number of regions during backward propagation.
  An experimental comparison shows the efficiency of our algorithm over that of
verifying permutation invariance as a two-safety property (using FFNN

challenges, such as 1) poor numerical conditioning caused by large variations

order within the set of measurements due to changing satellite visibility, and
3) overfitting to available data. In this work, we address the aforementioned
challenges and propose an approach for GNSS positioning by applying DNN-based
corrections to an initial position guess. Our DNN learns to output the position
correction using the set of pseudorange residuals and satellite line-of-sight
vectors as inputs. The limited variation in these input and output values
improves the numerical conditioning for our DNN. We design our DNN architecture
to combine information from the available GNSS measurements, which vary both in
number and order, by leveraging recent advancements in set-based deep learning
methods. Furthermore, we present a data augmentation strategy for reducing
overfitting in the DNN by randomizing the initial position guesses. We first
perform simulations and show an improvement in the initial positioning error

first-principles total energy calculations with thermodynamic solution models.
This method is applied to three representative 2D TMDC alloys: an isostructural
alloy, MoS2(1-x)Te2x, and two heterostructural alloys, Mo1-xWxTe2 and
WS2(1-x)Te2x. We show that the mixing enthalpy of the entire composition range
of these binary alloys can be reliably represented using a sub-regular solution
model fitted to the total energy of a small number of compositions that are
calculated using density-functional theory on special quasi-random structures.
The sub-regular solution model uses a cubic fit that captures three-body
effects that are important in these TMDC alloys having hexagonal structures. By
comparing both isostructural and heterostructural phase diagrams generated with
this method to those calculated with cluster expansion methods, we demonstrate
that this method can be used to rapidly design phase diagrams of TMDC alloys,
and related 2D materials.

contrast to most of the literature, we consider the problem with constraints on
signals imposed on the sender. This we achieve by fixing some of the
experiments in an exogenous manner; these are called determined experiments.
This modeling helps us understand real-world situations where this occurs:
e.g., multi-phase drug trials where the FDA determines some of the experiments,
funding of a startup by a venture capital firm, start-up acquisition by big
firms where late-stage assessments are determined by the potential acquirer,
multi-round job interviews where the candidates signal initially by presenting
their qualifications but the rest of the screening procedures are determined by
the interviewer. The non-determined experiments (signals) in the multi-phase
trial are to be chosen by the sender in order to persuade the receiver best.
With a binary state of the world, we start by deriving the optimal signaling
policy in the only non-trivial configuration of a two-phase trial with
binary-outcome experiments. We then generalize to multi-phase trials with
binary-outcome experiments where the determined experiments can be placed at
any chosen node in the trial tree. Here we present a dynamic programming

prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a two-step semi-supervised multi-modal
automated time annotation (MATA) method leveraging multi-dimensional
longitudinal EHR encounter records. In step I, we employ a functional principal
component analysis approach to estimate the underlying intensity functions
based on observed point processes from the unlabeled patients. In step II, we
fit a penalized proportional odds model to the event time outcomes with
features derived in step I in the labeled data where the non-parametric
baseline function is approximated using B-splines. Under regularity conditions,
the resulting estimator of the feature effect vector is shown as root-$n$
consistent. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach relative to existing

to this challenge has emerged in the shape of blockchain architecture, which
ensures immutability of stored information, whilst remaining in an online

set-sized parcels of data called blocks. Links (liken to a chain) between these

approximate inference that have complementary strengths. Sampling methods excel
at approximating arbitrary probability distributions, but can be inefficient.
VI methods are efficient, but may misrepresent the true distribution. Here, we
develop a general framework where approximations are stochastic mixtures of
simple component distributions. Both sampling and VI can be seen as special
cases: in sampling, each mixture component is a delta-function and is chosen
stochastically, while in standard VI a single component is chosen to minimize
divergence. We derive a practical method that interpolates between sampling and
VI by solving an optimization problem over a mixing distribution. Intermediate
inference methods then arise by varying a single parameter. Our method provably
improves on sampling (reducing variance) and on VI (reducing bias+variance
despite increasing variance). We demonstrate our method's bias/variance
trade-off in practice on reference problems, and we compare outcomes to
commonly used sampling and VI methods. This work takes a step towards a highly

any virus before it. One one had, this will help biologists, policy makers and
other authorities to make timely and appropriate decisions to control the
spread of the coronavirus. On the other hand, such studies will help to more
effectively deal with any possible future pandemic. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus
contains different variants, each of them having different mutations,
performing any analysis on such data becomes a difficult task. It is well known
that much of the variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome happens disproportionately
in the spike region of the genome sequence -- the relatively short region which
codes for the spike protein(s). Hence, in this paper, we propose an approach to
cluster spike protein sequences in order to study the behavior of different
known variants that are increasing at very high rate throughout the world. We
use a k-mers based approach to first generate a fixed-length feature vector
representation for the spike sequences. We then show that with the appropriate
feature selection, we can efficiently and effectively cluster the spike
sequences based on the different variants. Using a publicly available set of
SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences, we perform clustering of these sequences using both
hard and soft clustering methods and show that with our feature selection
methods, we can achieve higher F1 scores for the clusters.

random forests and gradient boosting. Their statistical properties, however,
are not well understood. The most cited prior works have focused on deriving
pointwise consistency guarantees for CART in a classical nonparametric
regression setting. We take a different approach, and advocate studying the
generalization performance of decision trees with respect to different
generative regression models. This allows us to elicit their inductive bias,
that is, the assumptions the algorithms make (or do not make) to generalize to
new data, thereby guiding practitioners on when and how to apply these methods.
In this paper, we focus on sparse additive generative models, which have both
low statistical complexity and some nonparametric flexibility. We prove a sharp
squared error generalization lower bound for a large class of decision tree
algorithms fitted to sparse additive models with $C^1$ component functions.
This bound is surprisingly much worse than the minimax rate for estimating such
sparse additive models. The inefficiency is due not to greediness, but to the
loss in power for detecting global structure when we average responses solely
over each leaf, an observation that suggests opportunities to improve
tree-based algorithms, for example, by hierarchical shrinkage. To prove these
bounds, we develop new technical machinery, establishing a novel connection
between decision tree estimation and rate-distortion theory, a sub-field of
information theory.

$B_n$ is the $n$-th Bernoulli number. This congruence was generalized by Wang
and Cai in 2014, and Cai, Shen and Jia in 2017 by replacing the odd prime $p$
in the summation and modulus with an odd prime power, and a product of two odd
prime powers, respectively. In particular, Cai, Shen and Jia proposed a
conjectural congruence: for any positive integer $n$ with an odd prime factor
$p$ such that $p^r \parallel n$ where $r\ge 1$, $$\sum_{\substack{i,j,k\ge
1\\\gcd(ijk,n)=1\\i+j+k=n}}\frac{1}{ijk}\equiv -2B_{p-3}\cdot \frac{n}{p}\cdot
\prod_{\substack{\text{prime $q\mid n$}\\q\ne
p}}\left(1-\frac{2}{q}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{q^3}\right) \pmod{p^r}.$$ In this
paper, we establish the following generalization of their conjecture: for any
positive integer $n$ with an odd prime factor $p$ such that $p^r \parallel n$
where $r\ge 1$, $$\begin{aligned} \sum_{\substack{i,j,k\ge
1\\\gcd(ijk,n)=1\\a_1 i+a_2 j+a_3 k=An}}\frac{1}{ijk}&\equiv -2B_{p-3}\cdot
\frac{n}{p}\cdot \frac{Ag^3}{3}\left(\frac{1}{a_1^2 g_1^2}+\frac{1}{a_2^2
g_2^2}+\frac{1}{a_3^2 g_3^2}\right)\\ &\quad\times \prod_{\substack{\text{prime
$q\mid n$}\\q\ne p}}\left(1-\frac{2}{q}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{q^3}\right)
\pmod{p^r}, \end{aligned}$$ where $a_1$, $a_2$ and $a_3$ are positive integers
coprime to $p$, and $A$ is a positive common multiple of $a_1$, $a_2$ and
$a_3$. Also, $g_1=\gcd(a_2,a_3)$, $g_2=\gcd(a_3,a_1)$, $g_3=\gcd(a_1,a_2)$ and
$g=\gcd(a_1,a_2,a_3)$.

and zb GaN on diamond interfaces using slab supercell models. Details are
provided on the dependence of electronic properties with respect to supercell
size, the use of pseudo-hydrogen to passivate the bottom GaN layer, and dipole
corrections. The large bulk modulus of diamond provides a templating structure
for GaN to grow upon, where a large lattice mismatch is accounted for through
the inclusion of a cationic Ga adlayer. Looking at both type I and II surfaces
and interfaces of GaN shows the instability of zb GaN without an adlayer (type
II), where increased size, pseudo-hydrogen passivation and dipole corrections
do not remove the spurious interaction between the top and bottom layers in
type II GaN. Layer dependent density of states, local potential differences,
and charge density differences show that the type I interface (with a Ga
adlayer) is stable with an adhesion energy of 0.704 eV/{\AA}2 (4.346 J/m2);
interestingly, the diamond charge density intercalates into the first layer of
GaN, which was seen experimentally for wurtzite GaN grown over diamond. The
type II interface is shown to be unstable which implies that, to form a stable,
thin-film zb interface between GaN and diamond, the partial pressure of
trimethylgallium must be controlled to ensure a Ga layer exists both on the top
and bottom layer of the GaN thin film atop the diamond. We believe our results
can shed light towards a better understanding of the GaN/diamond multifaceted
interface present in the GaN overgrowth on diamond samples.

implemented to evaluate interventions delivered to groups of participants, such

CRTs, several challenges remain. First, there are many possible ways to specify
the causal effect of interest (e.g., at the individual-level or at the
cluster-level). Second, the theoretical and practical performance of common
methods for CRT analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we present a general
framework to formally define an array of causal effects in terms of summary
measures of counterfactual outcomes. Next, we provide a comprehensive overview
of CRT estimators, including the t-test, generalized estimating equations
(GEE), augmented-GEE, and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). Using
finite sample simulations, we illustrate the practical performance of these
estimators for different causal effects and when, as commonly occurs, there are
limited numbers of clusters of different sizes. Finally, our application to
data from the Preterm Birth Initiative (PTBi) study demonstrates the real-world
impact of varying cluster sizes and targeting effects at the cluster-level or
at the individual-level. Specifically, the relative effect of the PTBI
intervention was 0.81 at the cluster-level, corresponding to a 19% reduction in
outcome incidence, and was 0.66 at the individual-level, corresponding to a 34%
reduction in outcome risk. Given its flexibility to estimate a variety of
user-specified effects and ability to adaptively adjust for covariates for
precision gains while maintaining Type-I error control, we conclude TMLE is a
promising tool for CRT analysis.

document substantial variation in the relative importance of each subspace,
suggesting that there may be systematic differences in the organization of care
delivery networks across health care markets. Moreover, we find that the

we observed a giant enhancement with an enhancement factor of ~3,100 for dark
excitons enabled by transverse magnetic BICs with intrinsic out-of-plane

demonstrated highly directional emission from the dark excitons with a
divergence angle of merely 7 degrees. We found that the directional emission is
coherent at room temperature, unambiguously shown in polarization analyses and

misspecification and is asymptotically equal or more precise than the analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA) estimator and the MMRM estimator. Under missing at

via simulation studies that IMMRM continues to have less bias and smaller

not present at $v$. OU discipline is a natural candidate for reducing the AoI.
We show that, surprisingly, OU \emph{does not} provide the maximum stability
region. As the main result of this paper, we prove that OU \emph{does} have the
maximum stability region in the important special case of a complete graph
network with equal capacities on all links and equal flow rates originating in
all nodes. Simulation results show that, in the latter special case, OU
out-performs RU in terms of AoI.
  In the final part of this paper, we consider the cumulative delays
experienced by a packet as it propagates through the system, specifically their
limiting behavior as $N \to \infty$. We state some conjectures about this
behavior, supported by heuristic arguments and simulation experiments. Notably,
we conjecture (and observe in simulations) that the expected delays under RU
and OU remain of the same order as those in the ""free"" system.

Such theories, if quantized with the Feynman prescription, would contain

particles by means of the fakeon prescription and the resulting theories are
both renormalizable and unitary. We extract the necessary number of fields to
obtain asymptotic freedom by solving the relevant renormalization-group
equations in the ultraviolet limit. We show that in the case of irreducible
rank-$s$ bosons with minimal kinetic term only a certain number of fields with
$0\leq s \leq 3$ is compatible with asymptotic freedom. No solution involving
fermionic rank-$s$ fields are found. We also consider the cases of rank-$1$ and

tool for retail insurance ratemaking, macro-level catastrophic risk

which is initially designed for cross-sectional data, has recently been adapted
to a longitudinal context to conduct both a priori and a posteriori ratemaking,
through the introduction of random effects. However, so far, the random
effect(s) is usually assumed static due to computational concerns, leading to
predictive premium that omit the seniority of the claims. In this paper, we
propose a new CRM model with bivariate dynamic random effect process. The model
is based on Bayesian state-space models. It is associated with the simple
predictive mean and closed form expression for the likelihood function, while
also allowing for the dependence between the frequency and severity components.

federated learning over the air (FLOA) provides high communication efficiency
and privacy provisioning under the edge computing paradigm. When all edge
devices (workers) simultaneously upload their local updates to the parameter
server (PS) through commonly shared time-frequency resources, the PS obtains
the averaged update only rather than the individual local ones. While such a
concurrent transmission and aggregation scheme reduces the latency and
communication costs, it unfortunately renders FLOA vulnerable to Byzantine
attacks. Aiming at Byzantine-resilient FLOA, this paper starts from analyzing
the channel inversion (CI) mechanism that is widely used for power control in
FLOA. Our theoretical analysis indicates that although CI can achieve good
learning performance in the benign scenarios, it fails to work well with
limited defensive capability against Byzantine attacks. Then, we propose a
novel scheme called the best effort voting (BEV) power control policy that is
integrated with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our BEV-SGD enhances the
robustness of FLOA to Byzantine attacks, by allowing all the workers to send
their local updates at their maximum transmit power. Under worst-case attacks,
we derive the expected convergence rates of FLOA with CI and BEV power control
policies, respectively. The rate comparison reveals that our BEV-SGD
outperforms its counterpart with CI in terms of better convergence behavior,
which is verified by experimental simulations.

M-dwarf stars (KOI-126 B and C) in a 1.74 day orbit which revolve around an
F-star (KOI-126 A) every 34 days. Complex eclipse shapes are created as the M
stars transit the F star, due to two effects: (i) the duration of the eclipse
is a significant fraction of the M-star orbital period, so the prograde or
retrograde motion of the M stars in their orbit lead to unusually short or long
duration eclipses; (ii) due to 3-body dynamics, the M-star orbit precesses with
an astonishingly quick timescale of 1.74 years for the periastron (apsidal)
precession, and 2.73 years for the inclination and nodal angle precession.
Using the full Kepler data set, supplemented with ground-based photometry, plus
29 radial velocity measurements that span 6 years, our photodynamical modeling
yields masses of $M_{A} = 1.2713 \pm 0.0047 M_{\odot}$ (0.37%), $M_{B} =

M-dwarfs, a parameter that characterizes the internal mass distribution. While
not particularly precise, we measure a mean apsidal motion constant,

osteoporosis on panoramic radiographs.
  Study Design. A dataset of 70 panoramic radiographs (PRs) from 70 different
subjects of age between 49 to 60 was used, including 49 subjects with
osteoporosis and 21 normal subjects. We utilized the leave-one-out
cross-validation approach to generate 70 training and test splits.
Specifically, for each split, one image was used for testing and the remaining
69 images were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
using the Siamese architecture was implemented through a fine-tuning process to
classify an PR image using patches extracted from eight representative
trabecula bone areas (Figure 1). In order to automatically learn the importance
of different PR patches, an attention module was integrated into the deep CNN.
Three metrics, including osteoporosis accuracy (OPA), non-osteoporosis accuracy
(NOPA) and overall accuracy (OA), were utilized for performance evaluation.
  Results. The proposed baseline CNN approach achieved the OPA, NOPA and OA
scores of 0.667, 0.878 and 0.814, respectively. With the help of the attention
module, the OPA, NOPA and OA scores were further improved to 0.714, 0.939 and
0.871, respectively.
  Conclusions. The proposed method obtained promising results using deep CNN

effects experienced by inclusive $J/\psi$ at mid-rapidity in 0-100\% $p$+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 200 GeV is presented. Such effects
are quantified utilizing the nuclear modification factor, $R_{p\mathrm{Au}}$,
obtained by taking a ratio of $J/\psi$ yield in $p$+Au collisions to that in
$p$+$p$ collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions.
The differential $J/\psi$ yield in both $p$+$p$ and $p$+Au collisions is
measured through the dimuon decay channel, taking advantage of the trigger
capability provided by the Muon Telescope Detector in the RHIC 2015 run.
Consequently, the $J/\psi$ $R_{p\mathrm{Au}}$ is derived within the transverse
momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) range of 0 to 10 GeV/$c$. A suppression of
approximately 30% is observed for $p_{\mathrm{T}}<2$ GeV/$c$, while $J/\psi$
$R_{p\mathrm{Au}}$ becomes compatible with unity for $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ greater
than 3 GeV/$c$, indicating the $J/\psi$ yield is minimally affected by the CNM
effects at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. Comparison to a similar measurement from
0-20% central Au+Au collisions reveals that the observed strong $J/\psi$
suppression above 3 Gev/$c$ is mostly due to the hot medium effects, providing
strong evidence for the formation of the quark-gluon plasma in these
collisions. Several model calculations show qualitative agreement with the
measured $J/\psi$ $R_{p\mathrm{Au}}$, while their agreement with the $J/\psi$
yields in $p$+$p$ and $p$+Au collisions is worse.

foundational to development and rising standards of living. Our understanding

how the complexity of an economy is expressed in the makeup of its output.
However, the connection between these branches is not well understood, nor how

present a simple dynamical modeling framework that unifies these areas of work,
based on the widespread observation that economies diversify preferentially
into activities that are related to ones they do already. We show how stylized
facts of long-run structural change, as well as complexity metrics, can both
emerge naturally from this one observation. However, complexity metrics take on
new meanings, as descriptions of the long-term changes an economy experiences
rather than measures of complexity per se. This suggests relatedness and
complexity metrics are connected, in a hitherto overlooked way: Both describe
structural change, on different time scales. Whereas relatedness probes
transformation on short time scales, complexity metrics capture long-term
change.

statistically steady state for self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow
(SG-CFD). A broad spectrum of halos and halo groups are necessary to form from
inverse mass cascade for long-range interaction system to maximize its entropy.
The limiting velocity ($\textbf X$), speed ($\textbf Z$), and energy ($\textbf
E$) distributions of collisionless particles can be obtained analytically from
a maximum entropy principle. Halo mass function, the distribution of total mass
in halos, is a fundamental quantity for structure formation and evolution.
Instead of basing mass functions on simplified spherical/elliptical collapse
models, it is possible to reformulate mass function as an intrinsic
distribution to maximize system entropy during the everlasting statistically
steady state. Starting from halo-based description of non-equilibrium dark
matter flow, distributions of particle virial dispersion ($\textbf H$), square
of particle velocity ($\textbf P$), and number of halos ($\textbf J$) are
proposed. Their statistical properties and connections with velocity
distribution ($\textbf X$) are well studied and established. With $\textbf H$
being essentially the halo mass function, two limiting cases of $\textbf H$
distribution are analyzed for large halos ($\textbf H_\infty$) and small halos
($\textbf H_s$), respectively. For large halos, $\textbf H_\infty$ is shown to
also be a maximum entropy distribution. For small halos, $\textbf H_s$
approximates the $\textbf P$ distribution and recovers the Press-Schechter mass
function. The full solution of $\textbf H$ distribution is determined by the
velocity distribution ($\textbf X$) that maximizes system entropy and the exact
model of halo velocity dispersion.

be a powerful method for imputation. However, its computational effort and
potential numerical instabilities produce costly and/or unreliable predictions,
potentially limiting its use on large scale datasets. In this paper, we apply a
recently developed multi-level stochastic optimization approach to the problem
of imputation in massive medical records. The approach is based on
computational applied mathematics techniques and is highly accurate. In
particular, for the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) this multi-level
formulation is exact, and is also significantly faster and more numerically
stable. This permits practical application of Kriging methods to data
imputation problems for massive datasets. We test this approach on data from

Numerical results show the multi-level method significantly outperforms current

as compared with methods recommended in the recent report from HCUP on the
important problem of missing data, which could lead to sub-optimal and poorly

the analogous question for the Lorentz-covariant dynamics of fields on
spacelike slices of spacetime. We establish a relationship, between the
DeDonder--Weyl--Christodoulou formulation of covariant Hamilton--Jacobi
equations for the classical field evolution, and the Lorentz-covariant
Dirac-type wave equation proposed by Kanatchikov amended by our proposed
guiding equation for such fields. We show that Kanatchikov's equation is
well-posed and generally solvable, and we establish the correspondence between
plane-wave solutions of Kanatchikov's equation and solutions of the covariant
Hamilton--Jacobi equations of DeDonder--Weyl--Christodoulou. We propose a
covariant guiding law for the temporal evolution of fields defined on constant
time slices of spacetime, and show that it yields, at each spacetime point, the
existence of a finite measure on the space of field values at that point that
is equivariant with respect to the flow induced by the solution of
Kanatchikov's equation that is guiding the actual field, so long as it is a

performed complementary optical photometric monitoring observations. We found
that the dust thermal emission from the hot inner disk mid-plane of FU Ori has
been approximately stationary and the maximum dust grain size is $\gtrsim$1.6
mm in this region. If the hot inner disk of FU Ori which is inward of the
150-170 K water snowline is turbulent (e.g., corresponding to a Sunyaev &
Shakura viscous $\alpha_{t}\gtrsim$0.1), or if the actual maximum grain size is
still larger than the lower limit we presently constrain, then as suggested by
the recent analytical calculations and the laboratory measurements, water-ice
free dust grains may be stickier than water-ice coated dust grains in
protoplanetary disks. Additionally, we find that the free-free emission and the
Johnson B and V bands magnitudes of these binary stars are brightening in
2016-2020. The optical and radio variability might be related to the
dynamically evolving protostellar or disk accretion activities. Our results
highlight that hot inner disks of outbursting objects are important
laboratories for testing models of dust grain growth. Given the active nature
of such systems, to robustly diagnose the maximum dust grain sizes, it is
important to carry out coordinated multi-wavelength radio observations.

attack-tolerance analysis of networks. In recent decades, various qualitative

second-stage problem to a less complex but equivalent problem, and (iii)
identifies underlying knapsack constraints and generates lifted cover

near-infrared spectra of ten L dwarfs, and constrain the sizes of dust grains
in each L dwarf atmosphere. In previous studies, by comparing observed and
modeled spectra, it was suggested that the deviations of their spectral shapes
from theoretical prediction are general characteristics. Here, we focus on the
dust size in brown dwarf atmospheres to understand the observed spectra. We
confirm that changing the dust size changes the temperature-pressure structure
of the atmosphere, with the shape of the spectrum changing accordingly. At the
wavelength at which dust is the main absorber of radiation (the dust-dominated
regime), a large dust opacity combined with a medium grain size, e.g., 0.1
$\mu$m, results in a low photospheric temperature, and thus a small flux.
Conversely, for the wavelength at which gas absorption is dominant (the
gas-dominated regime), a large dust opacity modifies the temperature-pressure
structure, resulting in a high photospheric temperature, which corresponds to
large flux emissions. Taking into account the size effect, we compare the model
spectral fluxes in the wavelength range 1-5 $\mu$m with the observational ones
to constrain the main dust size in the atmosphere of each of the ten L dwarfs
observed with AKARI and SpeX or CGS4. Ultimately, we reveal that the observed
data are reproduced with higher fidelity by models based on a medium dust size
of 0.1-3.0 $\mu$m for six of these L dwarfs; therefore, we suggest that such
atmospheric dust sizes apply to the majority of L dwarfs.

parameters associated to integer compositions. Our results on rectangular bands
answer a question of Easdown from 1992, and our approach utilises some results
of independent interest concerning partitions/colourings of hypergraphs.
  As an application, we prove some results on the degree of a variant $T_n^a$.
(The variant $S^a=(S,\star)$ of a semigroup $S$, with respect to a fixed
element $a\in S$, has underlying set $S$ and operation $x\star y=xay$.) It has
been previously shown that $n\leq \mu(T_n^a)\leq 2n-r$ if the sandwich element
$a$ has rank $r$, and the upper bound of $2n-r$ is known to be sharp if $r\geq
n-1$. Here we show that $\mu(T_n^a)=2n-r$ for $r\geq n-6$. In stark contrast to
this, when $r=1$, and the above inequality says $n\leq\mu(T_n^a)\leq 2n-1$, we
show that $\mu(T_n^a)/n\to1$ and $\mu(T_n^a)-n\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$.
  Among other results, we also classify the $3$-nilpotent subsemigroups of
$T_n$, and calculate the maximum size of such a subsemigroup.

strongly dependent on continuous variables because most of them inevitably
involve Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance. With industrial processes becoming
more and more complex and integrated, binary variables also appear in
monitoring variables besides continuous variables, which makes process
monitoring more challenging. The aforementioned traditional approaches are
incompetent to mine the information of binary variables, so that the useful
information contained in them is usually discarded during the data
preprocessing. To solve the problem, this paper focuses on the issue of hybrid
variable monitoring (HVM) and proposes a novel unsupervised framework of
process monitoring with hybrid variables including continuous and binary
variables. HVM is addressed in the probabilistic framework, which can
effectively exploit the process information implicit in both continuous and
binary variables at the same time. In HVM, the statistics and the monitoring
strategy suitable for hybrid variables with only healthy state data are defined
and the physical explanation behind the framework is elaborated. In addition,
the estimation of parameters required in HVM is derived in detail and the
detectable condition of the proposed method is analyzed. Finally, the
superiority of HVM is fully demonstrated first on a numerical simulation and
then on an actual case of a thermal power plant.

formation rate (SFR) indicator for the host galaxies of luminous active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). We decompose the spectra with our recently developed
template-fitting technique to measure PAH fluxes and upper limits, which we
interpret using mock spectra that simulate the effects of AGN dilution. While
luminous quasars can severely dilute and affect the detectability of emission
lines, PAHs are intrinsically weak in some sources that are otherwise gas-rich
and vigorously forming stars, conclusively demonstrating that powerful AGNs
destroy PAH molecules. Comparing PAH-based SFRs with independent SFRs derived
from the mid-infrared fine-structure neon lines and the total infrared
luminosity reveals that PAHs can trace star formation activity in quasars with
bolometric luminosities $\lesssim 10^{46}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$, but increasingly
underestimate the SFR for more powerful quasars, typically by $\sim 0.5$ dex.
Relative to star-forming galaxies and low-luminosity AGNs, quasars have a
comparable PAH 11.3 $\mu$m/7.7 $\mu$m ratio but characteristically lower ratios
of 6.2 $\mu$m/7.7 $\mu$m, 8.6 $\mu$m/7.7 $\mu$m, and 11.3 $\mu$m/17.0 $\mu$m.
We suggest that these trends indicate that powerful AGNs preferentially destroy
small grains and enhance the PAH ionization fraction.

APIs, we propose Occam, a decision-only black-box adversarial attack, where
only final decisions are available to the adversary. In Occam, we formulate the
decision-only AE generation as a discontinuous large-scale global optimization
problem, and solve it by adaptively decomposing this complicated problem into a
set of sub-problems and cooperatively optimizing each one. Our Occam is a
one-size-fits-all approach, which achieves 100% success rates of attacks with
an average SNR of 14.23dB, on a wide range of popular speech and speaker
recognition APIs, including Google, Alibaba, Microsoft, Tencent, iFlytek, and

voice control devices, we propose NI-Occam, the first non-interactive physical
adversarial attack, where the adversary does not need to query the oracle and
has no access to its internal information and training data. We combine
adversarial attacks with model inversion attacks, and thus generate the
physically-effective audio AEs with high transferability without any
interaction with target devices. Our experimental results show that NI-Occam
can successfully fool Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, iFlytek

foundations of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics as well as various
applications in quantum technology represented by optimal quantum control.
While extensive studies have made efforts to obtain rigorous constraints on
dynamical processes since Mandelstam and Tamm, speed limits that provide tight
bounds for macroscopic transitions have remained elusive. Here, by employing
the local conservation law of probability, the fundamental principle in
physics, we develop a general framework for deriving qualitatively tighter
speed limits for macroscopic systems than many conventional ones. We show for
the first time that the speed of the expectation value of an observable defined
on an arbitrary graph, which can describe general many-body systems, is bounded
by the ""gradient"" of the observable, in contrast with conventional speed limits
depending on the entire range of the observable. This framework enables us to
derive novel quantum speed limits for macroscopic unitary dynamics. Unlike
previous bounds, the speed limit decreases when the expectation value of the
transition Hamiltonian increases; this intuitively describes a new tradeoff
relation between time and quantum phase difference. Our bound is dependent on
instantaneous quantum states and thus can achieve the equality condition, which
is conceptually distinct from the Lieb-Robinson bound. Our work elucidates
novel speed limits on the basis of local conservation law, providing
fundamental limits to various types of nonequilibrium quantum macroscopic
phenomena.

oceans is crucial for our understanding of the effects of increasing greenhouse
gas concentrations. The Argo program, consisting of Lagrangian floats that
measure vertical temperature profiles throughout the global ocean, has provided
a wealth of data from which to estimate ocean heat content. However, creating a
globally consistent statistical model for ocean heat content remains
challenging due to the need for a globally valid covariance model that can
capture complex nonstationarity. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian Gaussian process model that uses kernel convolutions with cylindrical
distances to allow for spatial non-stationarity in all model parameters while
using a Vecchia process to remain computationally feasible for large spatial
datasets. Our approach can produce valid credible intervals for globally
integrated quantities that would not be possible using previous approaches.
These advantages are demonstrated through the application of the model to Argo
data, yielding credible intervals for the spatially varying trend in ocean heat
content that accounts for both the uncertainty induced from interpolation and
from estimating the mean field and other parameters. Through cross-validation,
we show that our model out-performs an out-of-the-box approach as well as other
simpler models. The code for performing this analysis is provided as the R

English analyzed from an and Agentive vs. Experiential distinction across the
five basic sensory modalities: Visual (to look vs. to see), Auditory (to listen
vs. to hear), Tactile (to touch vs. to feel), Olfactory (to smell), and
Gustatory (to taste). In this study we report on a data-driven approach based
on distributional-semantic word embeddings and clustering models to identify
and uncover the descriptor sensory spaces of the perception verbs. In the
analysis, we identified differences and similarities of the generated
descriptors based on qualitative and quantitative differences of the perceptual
experience they denote. For instance, our results show that while the
perceptual spaces of the experiential verbs like to see, to hear show a more
detached, logical way of knowing and learning, their agentive counterparts (to
look, listen) provide a more intentional as well as more intimate and intuitive
way of discovering and interacting with the world around us. We believe that
such an approach has a high potential to expand our understanding and the
applicability of such sensory spaces to different fields of social and cultural
analysis. Research on the semantic organization of sensory spaces for various
applications might benefit from an the Agentive/Experiential account to address
the complexity of multiple senses wired with each other in still unexplored

the breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance.
Under the assumption that the criterion is met, we solve the many-body

in the case of $n=3$; we determine the exact phase diagram for the
scale-invariance breaking in the three-body problem of identical bosons and

Many state-of-the-art traffic classifiers automatically extract features from

Unfortunately, the compositional and causal relationships between packets are
not well extracted in these deep learning models, which affects both prediction

study. It is one of the most energetic and the most scattered pulsar known. It
is associated with HESS J1813--178, one of the brightest and most compact TeV
sources in the sky. Recently, Ho et al. used archival X-ray Chandra
observations separated by more than 10 years and determined that the total
proper motion of PSR J1813--1749 is $\sim66$~mas~yr$^{-1}$, corresponding to a
velocity of $\sim$1900 km s$^{-1}$ for a distance of 6.2 kpc. These results
would imply that this pulsar is the fastest neutron star known in the Galaxy
and, by estimating the angular separation with respect to the center of the
associated supernova remnant, has an age of only $\sim300$ years, making it one
of the youngest pulsars known. Using archival high-angular-resolution VLA
observations taken over 12 years we have estimated the radio proper motions of
PSR~J1813--1748 to be much smaller:
($\mu_{\alpha}\cdot\cos(\delta),\,\mu_\delta$)=($-5.0\pm3.7,\,-13.2\pm6.7$)~mas~yr$^{-1}$,
or a total proper motion of $14.8\pm5.9$~mas~yr$^{-1}$. The positions
referenced against quasars make our results reliable. We conclude that PSR
J1813--1749 is not a very fast moving source. Its kinematic age using the new
total proper motion is $\sim1350$~years. This age is consistent within a factor
of a few with the characteristic age of the pulsar and with the age estimated
from the broadband spectral energy distribution of HESS J1813--178, as well as
the age of the associated SNR.

neutron star($\lesssim1.4~M_{\odot}$), as the neutrino heating is

waves (IGWs) by reducing the lensing noise in measurements of the $B$-modes in
CMB polarization. SO will initially observe CMB by using three small aperture
telescopes and one large-aperture telescope. While polarization maps from
small-aperture telescopes will be used to constrain IGWs, the internal CMB
lensing maps used to delens will be reconstructed from data from the
large-aperture telescope. Since lensing maps obtained from the SO data will be
noise-dominated on sub-degree scales, the SO lensing framework constructs a
template for lensing-induced $B$-modes by combining internal CMB lensing maps
with maps of the cosmic infrared background from Planck as well as galaxy
density maps from the LSST survey. We construct a likelihood for constraining
the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ that contains auto- and cross-spectra between
observed $B$-modes and the lensing $B$-mode template. We test our delensing
analysis pipeline on map-based simulations containing survey non-idealities,
but that, for this initial exploration, does not include contamination from
Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. We find that the SO survey masking and
inhomogeneous and atmospheric noise have very little impact on the delensing
performance, and the $r$ constraint becomes $\sigma(r)\approx 0.0015$ which is
close to that obtained from the idealized forecasts in the absence of the
Galactic foreground and is nearly a factor of two tighter than without
delensing. We also find that uncertainties in the external large-scale
structure tracers used in our multi-tracer delensing pipeline lead to bias much
smaller than the $1\,\sigma$ statistical uncertainties.

analytical method quickly assembles the $4^n$ matrix elements into at most
$2^{n+1}$ groups for simultaneous measurements in $O(nd)$ time, where $d$ is
the number of non-zero elements of $A$. The number of groups is particularly
small when $A$ is a band matrix. When the bandwidth of $A$ is $k=O(n^c)$, the
number of groups for simultaneous measurement reduces to $O(n^{c+1})$. In
addition, when non-zero elements densely fill the band, the variance is
$O((n^{c+1}/2^n)\,{\rm tr}(A^2))$, which is small compared with the variances
of existing methods. The proposed method requires a few additional gates for
each measurement, namely one Hadamard gate, one phase gate and at most $n-1$

this work, we extend this approach to the FW setting and show that the optimal
way to combine the past iterates is using a set of orthogonal Jacobi
polynomials. We also a polynomial-based acceleration technique, referred to as
Jacobi polynomial accelerated FW, which combines the current iterate with the
past iterate using combing weights related to the Jacobi recursion. By
carefully choosing parameters of the Jacobi polynomials, we obtain a faster
sublinear convergence rate. We provide numerical experiments on real datasets
to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

problem due to the limited availability of anomaly examples. Typically, to
tackle this problem, an autoencoder (AE) is trained to reconstruct the input
with training set consisting only of normal data. At test time, the AE is then
expected to well reconstruct the normal data while poorly reconstructing the
anomalous data. However, several studies have shown that, even with only normal
data training, AEs can often start reconstructing anomalies as well which
depletes the anomaly detection performance. To mitigate this problem, we
propose a novel methodology to train AEs with the objective of reconstructing
only normal data, regardless of the input (i.e., normal or abnormal). Since no
real anomalies are available in the OCC settings, the training is assisted by
pseudo anomalies that are generated by manipulating normal data to simulate the
out-of-normal-data distribution. We additionally propose two ways to generate
pseudo anomalies: patch and skip frame based. Extensive experiments on three
challenging video anomaly datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
in improving conventional AEs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

excellent agreement with gas-phase observational abundances for many molecules,

conventional diffusive mechanisms. Observed ratios of structural isomers methyl

main temperature regimes are identified in which various complex organic

many COMs to much earlier times and lower temperatures than in previous model
implementations. Those species may form either as by-products of simple-ice
production, or via early photochemistry within the ices while external UV
photons can still penetrate. Cosmic ray-induced photochemistry is less
important than in past models, although it affects some species strongly over
long timescales. Another production regime occurs during the high-temperature
desorption of solid water, whereby radicals trapped in the ice are released
onto the grain/ice surface, where they rapidly react. Several recently-proposed
gas-phase COM-production mechanisms are also introduced, but they rarely

hyperspectral imagery analysis. However, the influence of light, acquisition
conditions and the inherent properties of materials, results in that the
identified endmembers can vary spectrally within a given image (construed as
spectral variability). To address this issue, recent methods usually use a
priori obtained spectral library to represent multiple characteristic spectra
of the same object, but few of them extracted the spectral variability
explicitly. In this paper, a spectral variability augmented sparse unmixing

the first time. The variable spectra are divided into two parts of intrinsic
spectrum and spectral variability for spectral reconstruction, and modeled
synchronously in the SU model adding the regular terms restricting the sparsity
of abundance and the generalization of the variability coefficient. It is noted
that the spectral variability library and the intrinsic spectral library are
all constructed from the In-situ observed image. Experimental results over both

documents, we typically measure the importance of phrase according to its
syntactic accuracy, information saliency, and concept consistency
simultaneously. However, most existing keyphrase extraction approaches only
focus on the part of them, which leads to biased results. In this paper, we
propose a new approach to estimate the importance of keyphrase from multiple
perspectives (called as \textit{KIEMP}) and further improve the performance of
keyphrase extraction. Specifically, \textit{KIEMP} estimates the importance of
phrase with three modules: a chunking module to measure its syntactic accuracy,
a ranking module to check its information saliency, and a matching module to
judge the concept (i.e., topic) consistency between phrase and the whole
document. These three modules are seamlessly jointed together via an end-to-end
multi-task learning model, which is helpful for three parts to enhance each
other and balance the effects of three perspectives. Experimental results on
six benchmark datasets show that \textit{KIEMP} outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction approaches in most cases.

the condition of the human heart. By using deep neural networks (DNNs),
interpretation of ECG signals can be fully automated for the identification of
potential abnormalities in a patient's heart in a fraction of a second. Studies
have shown that given a sufficiently large amount of training data, DNN

However, despite of the excellent performance in classification accuracy, DNNs
are highly vulnerable to adversarial noises that are subtle changes in the

challenging and essential to improve robustness of DNNs against adversarial
noises, which are a threat to life-critical applications. In this work, we
proposed a regularization method to improve DNN robustness from the perspective
of noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) for the application of ECG signal

their longitudinal and lateral movements are utilized to incorporate spatial
coherence measurement using this modified Michelson interferometer. In general,
one uses Young double slit interferometer to measure spatial coherence.
However, this modified interferometer can be used as an optical setup kept at
room temperature outside a cryostat to measure spatio-temporal coherence of a
light source placed at cryogenic temperatures. This avoids the added
complexities of modulation of interference fringe patterns due to single slit
diffraction as well. The process of mixing of spatial and temporal parts of
coherences is intrinsic to existing methods for dual measurements. We addressed
these issues of spatiotemporal mixing and we introduced a method of temporal
filtering in spatial coherence measurements. We also developed a curve overlap
method which is used to extend the range of the experimental setup during
temporal coherence measurements without compromising the precision. Together,
these methods provide major advantages over plane mirror based standard
interferometric systems for dual measurements in avoiding systematic errors

subsidies and time-varying transaction fees. The transaction fees are offered
by the senders whose transactions are packaged into blocks and is increasing
with the block size. However, the larger size of a block brings the longer
latency, resulting in a smaller probability of successfully mining. Therefore,
finding the optimal block size to trade off these two factors is a complex and
crucial problem for the mining pools. In this paper, we model a repeated mining
competition dynamics in blockchain system as an evolutionary game to study the
interactions among mining pools. In this game, each pool has two strategies: to
follow the default size $\bar{B}$, i.e., the upper bound of a block size, or
not follow. Because of the bounded rationality, each mining pool pursues its
evolutionary stable block size (ESS) according to the mining pools' computing
power and other factors by continuous learning and adjustments during the whole
mining process. A study framework is built for the general evolutionary game,
based on which we then theoretically explore the existence and stability of the

perspective of the human brain's memory processing, we find there exists two
issues in existing DUNs. One is the information between every two adjacent
stages, which can be regarded as short-term memory, is usually lost seriously.
The other is no explicit mechanism to ensure that the previous stages affect
the current stage, which means memory is easily forgotten. To solve these
issues, in this paper, a novel DUN with persistent memory for CS is proposed,
dubbed Memory-Augmented Deep Unfolding Network (MADUN). We design a
memory-augmented proximal mapping module (MAPMM) by combining two types of
memory augmentation mechanisms, namely High-throughput Short-term Memory (HSM)
and Cross-stage Long-term Memory (CLM). HSM is exploited to allow DUNs to
transmit multi-channel short-term memory, which greatly reduces information
loss between adjacent stages. CLM is utilized to develop the dependency of deep
information across cascading stages, which greatly enhances network
representation capability. Extensive CS experiments on natural and MR images
show that with the strong ability to maintain and balance information our MADUN
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. The source

patterns in relational data. For example, a relational dependency pattern may
stipulate that a user's gender is associated with the gender of their friends.
As with propositional (non-relational) graphical models, the major scalability
bottleneck for model discovery is computing instantiation counts: the number of
times a relational pattern is instantiated in a database. Previous work on
propositional learning utilized pre-counting or post-counting to solve this
task. This paper takes a detailed look at the memory and speed trade-offs
between pre-counting and post-counting strategies for relational learning. A
pre-counting approach computes and caches instantiation counts for a large set
of relational patterns before model search. A post-counting approach computes
an instantiation count dynamically on-demand for each candidate pattern
generated during the model search. We describe a novel hybrid approach,
tailored to relational data, that achieves a sweet spot with pre-counting for
patterns involving positive relationships (e.g. pairs of users who are friends)
and post-counting for patterns involving negative relationships (e.g. pairs of
users who are not friends). Our hybrid approach scales model discovery to
millions of data facts.

well while reconstructing the anomalies poorly. However, several studies show
that, even with normal data only training, AEs can often start reconstructing
anomalies as well which depletes their anomaly detection performance. To
mitigate this, we propose a temporal pseudo anomaly synthesizer that generates
fake-anomalies using only normal data. An AE is then trained to maximize the
reconstruction loss on pseudo anomalies while minimizing this loss on normal
data. This way, the AE is encouraged to produce distinguishable reconstructions
for normal and anomalous frames. Extensive experiments and analysis on three

presence of so-called B-modes in the cosmic shear two-point correlation
functions \xi_\pm(\vt), since lensing is expected to produce only E-mode shear.
Furthermore, there exist ambiguous modes which can not uniquely be assigned to
either E- or B-mode shear. We derive explicit equations for the pure-mode shear
correlation functions \xi_\pm^E/B(\vt) and their ambiguous components
\xi_\pm^amb(\vt), that can be derived from the measured \xi_\pm(\vt) on a
finite angular interval \tmin\le\vt\le\tmax, such that the latter can be
decomposed uniquely into pure-mode functions as \xi_+=\xi_+^E+\xi_+^B+\xi_+^amb
and \xi_-=\xi_-^E-\xi_-^B+\xi_-^amb. The derivation is obtained by defining a
new set of COSEBIs, for which explicit relations are obtained, and which yields
a smaller covariance between COSEBI modes. We derive the relation between
\xi_\pm^E/B/amb and the underlying E-/B-mode power spectra. The pure-mode
correlation functions can provide a diagnostics of systematics in configuration
space. We then apply our results to SLICS simulations and the KiDS-1000 cosmic
shear data, calculate the new COSEBIs and the pure-mode correlation functions,
as well as the corresponding covariances, and show that the new statistics fit
equally well to the best-fitting cosmological model as the previous KiDS-1000
analysis and recovers the same level of (insignificant) B-modes. We also
consider in some detail the ambiguous modes at first- and second-order level,
finding some surprising results; for example, the shear field of a point mass,
when cut along a line through the center, can not be ascribed uniquely to an
E-mode shear and is thus ambiguous, and the shear correlation functions
resulting from a random ensemble of point masses, when measured over a finite
angular range, correspond to an ambiguous mode.

able to perform THz time-domain spectroscopy of an individual, strongly
subwavelength (d/{\lambda}0=1/20) meta-atom. We unravel the linewidth
dependence of planar metamaterials as a function of the meta-atom number
indicating quenching of the Dicke superradiance.
  On these grounds, we investigate ultrastrongly coupled Landau polaritons at
the single resonator level, measuring a normalized coupling ratio of
{\Omega}/{\omega}=0.60 resulting from coupling of the fundamental mode to a few
thousand electrons. Similar measurements on a low loss, less doped two
dimensional electron gas yield a coupling ratio {\Omega}/{\omega}=0.33 with a
cooperativity C=4g^2/{\kappa}{\gamma}= 94. Interestingly, the coupling strength
of a coupled single resonator is the same as of a coupled array. Our findings
pave the way towards the control of light-matter interaction in the ultrastrong
coupling regime at the single electron/single resonator level. The proposed
technique is way more general and can be useful to characterize the complex
conductivity of micron-sized samples in the THz and sub-THz domain.

methodology can also be applied to the audio domain. Specifically, the Audio
Spectrogram Transformer (AST) achieves state-of-the-art results on various
audio classification benchmarks. However, pure Transformer models tend to
require more training data compared to CNNs, and the success of the AST relies
on supervised pretraining that requires a large amount of labeled data and a

  This paper focuses on audio and speech classification, and aims to reduce the
need for large amounts of labeled data for AST by leveraging self-supervised

To enable effective generalization while maintaining proper conservatism in
offline learning, we propose Expectile V-Learning (EVL), which smoothly
interpolates between the optimal value learning and behavior cloning. Further,
we introduce implicit planning along offline trajectories to enhance learned
V-values and accelerate convergence. Together, we present a new offline method

value of the curvature parameter ($K_{\rm sym}$) based on recent astronomical
data. First, assuming a standard saturation point, we calculate bulk nuclear
properties within KIDS-EDF for different values of the compression modulus of
symmetric nuclear matter ($K_0$) and of the leading-order symmetry energy
parameters, i.e., the symmetry energy ($J$) and slope ($L$) at saturation
density, each within a broadly accepted range, as well as $K_{\rm sym}$. All of
the above EoS parameters are varied independently of each other. The skewness
parameter ($Q_{\rm sym}$) is presently kept fixed at 650 MeV. For all EoS
parameter sets which describe the selected nuclear data within better than
$0.3\%$, we calculate the neutron-star equation of state and mass-radius
relation and analyze the results in terms of Pearson correlation coefficients
$r$. We find that the value of $K_{\rm sym}$ is strongly correlated with the
radius of both a canonical and a massive star ($|r|>0.9$). If we impose that
all known astronomical constraints on the neutron star radii must be satisfied,
we deduce $-150 < K_{\rm sym}<0$. As a result, the symmetry energy as a
function of the density is consistently found to have an inflection point at
$\rho_0<\rho<2\rho_0$. We take the opportunity to report that the neutron skin

neural networks (RNNs), in which population activity arises directly from a
low-dimensional projection of past activity. Although these two modeling

to have different domains of application. Here we examine the precise
relationship between latent LDS models and linear low-rank RNNs. When can one

require an explicit convex function to reflect generic topological priors, e.g.
the $\ell_1$ penalty for enforcing sparsity, which limits the flexibility and
expressiveness in learning rich topological structures. We propose to learn a

of alloying elements and volume fraction of retained austenite are subjected to
uniaxial tensile and Nakajima testing. Tensile mechanical properties are
determined, and the forming limit diagrams (FLDs) are plotted. Microstructure
of the tested samples is analyzed, and dramatic reduction of retained austenite
fraction is detected. It is demonstrated that all steels are able to accumulate
much higher amount of plastic strain when tested using Nakajima method. The
observed phenomenon is related to the multiaxial stress state and strain
gradients through the sheet thickness resulting in a fast transformation of
retained austenite, as well as the ability of the tempered martensitic matrix
to accumulate plastic strain. Surprisingly, a Q&P steel with the highest volume
fraction of retained austenite and highest tensile ductility shows the lowest
formability among studied grades. The latter observation is related to the
highest sum of fractions of initial fresh martensite and stress/strain induced
martensite promoting formation of microcracks. Their role and ability of

conditional intensity function, relational discovery of events and learning
approaches for optimization. We introduce most of recently proposed models by
dismantling them into the four parts, and conduct experiments by remodularizing
the first three parts with the same learning strategy for a fair empirical

function family, and propose a Granger causality discovery framework for
exploiting the relations among multi-types of events. Because the Granger
causality can be represented by the Granger causality graph, discrete graph
structure learning in the framework of Variational Inference is employed to
reveal latent structures of the graph. Further experiments show that the
proposed framework with latent graph discovery can both capture the relations
and achieve an improved fitting and predicting performance.

distributed algorithms to estimate the unknown orders and parameters by
combining the proposed local information criterion (LIC) with the distributed
least squares method. The simultaneous estimation for both the system orders

techniques, such as double array martingale limit theory, stochastic Lyapunov
functions, and martingale convergence theorems are employed. For the case where
the upper bounds of the true orders are available, we introduce a cooperative
excitation condition, under which the strong consistency of the estimation for
the orders and parameters is established. Moreover, for the case where the
upper bounds of true orders are unknown, similar distributed algorithm is
proposed to estimate both the orders and parameters, and the corresponding
convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm is provided. We remark that our
results are obtained without relying on the independency or stationarity
assumptions of regression vectors, and the cooperative excitation conditions
can show that all sensors can cooperate to fulfill the estimation task even

preserving the 18 VEC through aliovalent substitutions at the Ti site of TiNiSn
semiconducting behavior can be achieved, and hence one can tune the band
structure and band gap to maximize the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT)
value. Two approaches have been used for calculating the lattice thermal
conductivity ($\kappa_{L}$), one by fully solving the linearized phonon
Boltzmann transport (LBTE) equation from first$-$principles anharmonic lattice
dynamics calculations implemented in Phono3py code and other using Slack's
equation with calculated Debye temperature and Gr\""{u}neisen parameter using
the calculated elastic constant values. The calculated $\kappa_{L}$ values
decrease from parent TiNiSn to pentanary substituted TiNiSn systems as expected
due to fluctuation in atomic mass. The calculated $\kappa_{L}$ for Hf
containing systems La$_{0.25}$Hf$_{0.5}$V$_{0.25}$NiSn and non Hf containing
system La$_{0.25}$Zr$_{0.5}$V$_{0.25}$NiSn calculated from Phono3py (Slack's

respectively and the corresponding ZT value are found to be 0.54 (0.4) and 0.77

capacity show that La$_{0.25}$Hf$_{0.5}$V$_{0.25}$NiSn has more
optical$-$acoustic band mixing which creates more phonon$-$phonon scattering
and hence lower the $\kappa_{L}$ value and maximizing the ZT. Based on the

  gravitational-waves from Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's first three
  observing runs","22 pages, 6 figures, 1 table",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.105.122001","LIGO-P2100292","gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the first results from an all-sky all-frequency (ASAF) search for
an anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background using the data from the
first three observing runs of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors.
Upper limit maps on broadband anisotropies of a persistent stochastic
background were published for all observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo detectors.
However, a broadband analysis is likely to miss narrowband signals as the
signal-to-noise ratio of a narrowband signal can be significantly reduced when
combined with detector output from other frequencies. Data folding and the
computationally efficient analysis pipeline, {\tt PyStoch}, enable us to
perform the radiometer map-making at every frequency bin. We perform the search
at 3072 {\tt{HEALPix}} equal area pixels uniformly tiling the sky and in every
frequency bin of width $1/32$~Hz in the range $20-1726$~Hz, except for bins
that are likely to contain instrumental artefacts and hence are notched. We do
not find any statistically significant evidence for the existence of narrowband
gravitational-wave signals in the analyzed frequency bins. Therefore, we place
$95\%$ confidence upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain for each
pixel-frequency pair, the limits are in the range $(0.030 - 9.6)
\times10^{-24}$. In addition, we outline a method to identify candidate
pixel-frequency pairs that could be followed up by a more sensitive (and
potentially computationally expensive) search, e.g., a matched-filtering-based
analysis, to look for fainter nearly monochromatic coherent signals. The ASAF
analysis is inherently independent of models describing any spectral or spatial
distribution of power. We demonstrate that the ASAF results can be
appropriately combined over frequencies and sky directions to successfully
recover the broadband directional and isotropic results.

relevance of an effect in addition to its statistical significance, yet a
formal definition of practical relevance is still pending and shall be provided
within this paper. It appears that an underlying decision problem,
characterized by actions and a loss function, is required to define the notion
of practical relevance, rendering it a decision theoretic concept. In the
context of hypothesis-based analyses, the notion of practical relevance relates
to specifying the hypotheses reasonably, such that the null hypothesis does not
contain only a single parameter null value, but also all parameter values that
are equivalent to the null value on a practical level. In that regard, the
definition of practical relevance is also extended into the context of
hypotheses. The formal elaborations on the notion of practical relevance within
this paper indicate that, typically, a specific decision problem is implicitly
assumed when dealing with the practical relevance of an effect or some results.
As a consequence, involving decision theoretic considerations into a
statistical analysis suggests itself by the mere nature of the notion of
practical relevance.

the definition of those racial groups has a significant impact on the
underlying findings of such racial bias analysis. Previous studies define these
groups based on either demographic information (e.g. African, Asian etc.) or
skin tone (e.g. lighter or darker skins). The use of such sensitive or broad
group definitions has disadvantages for bias investigation and subsequent
counter-bias solutions design. By contrast, this study introduces an
alternative racial bias analysis methodology via facial phenotype attributes
for face recognition. We use the set of observable characteristics of an
individual face where a race-related facial phenotype is hence specific to the
human face and correlated to the racial profile of the subject. We propose
categorical test cases to investigate the individual influence of those
attributes on bias within face recognition tasks. We compare our
phenotype-based grouping methodology with previous grouping strategies and show
that phenotype-based groupings uncover hidden bias without reliance upon any
potentially protected attributes or ill-defined grouping strategies.
Furthermore, we contribute corresponding phenotype attribute category labels
for two face recognition tasks: RFW for face verification and VGGFace2 (test
set) for face identification.

an automated testing framework for evaluating the fairness of ASR systems.
AequeVox simulates different environments to assess the effectiveness of ASR
systems for different populations. In addition, we investigate whether the
chosen simulations are comprehensible to humans. We further propose a fault
localization technique capable of identifying words that are not robust to
these varying environments. Both components of AequeVox are able to operate in

that Floquet engineering based on longitudinal driving provides distinct
possibilities in enhancing the tunability of a quantum system without needing
additional resources. In particular, we study a multilevel model based on
gate-defined double quantum dots, where coherent interference occurs when the
system is driven longitudinally. We develop an effective model to describe the
driven dynamics of this multilevel system, and show that it is highly tunable
via the driving field. We then illustrate the versatility and rich physics of a
driven multilevel system by exploring phenomena such as driving modulation of
resonances, adiabatic state transfer, and dark state. In the context of qubit
control, we propose noise-resistant quantum gates based on adiabatic passage.
The theoretical consideration we present here is rather general, and is in
principle valid for other multilevel quantum systems.

the sum of eigenvalues of any feasible solution to the problem. Its
computational bound is (i) equivalent to that of Roos's original method (2018)

the expansion of individual supernova remnants (SNRs) using our suite of 3D
hydrodynamical (HD), magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) and CRMHD simulations
generated using RAMSES. We explore multiple ambient densities, magnetic fields
and fractions of supernova energy deposited as CRs ($\chi_{\rm CR}$),
accounting for cosmic ray anisotropic diffusion and streaming. All our runs
have comparable evolutions until the end of the Sedov-Taylor phase. However,
our CRMHD simulations experience an additional CR pressure-driven snowplough
phase once the CR energy dominates inside the SNR. We present a model for the
final momentum deposited by supernovae that captures this new phase: $p_{\rm
SNR} = 2.87\times 10^{5} (\chi_{\text{CR}} +
1)^{4.82}\left(\frac{n}{\text{cm}^{-3}}\right)^{-0.196} M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$.
Assuming a 10% fraction of SN energy in CRs leads to a 50% boost of the final
momentum, with our model predicting even higher impacts at lower ambient
densities. The anisotropic diffusion of CRs assuming an initially uniform
magnetic field leads to extended gas and cosmic ray outflows escaping from the
supernova poles. We also study a tangled initial configuration of the magnetic
field, resulting instead in a quasi-isotropic diffusion of CRs and earlier
momentum deposition. Finally, synthetic synchrotron observations of our
simulations using the POLARIS code show that the local magnetic field
configuration in the interstellar medium modifies the overall radio emission
morphology and polarisation.

development of capture technologies. Nevertheless, the dynamic range of common
display devices is still limited, therefore tone mapping (TM) remains a key
challenge for image visualization. Recent work has demonstrated that neural
networks can achieve remarkable performance in this task when compared to
traditional methods, however, the quality of the results of these
learning-based methods is limited by the training data. Most existing works use
as training set a curated selection of best-performing results from existing
traditional tone mapping operators (often guided by a quality metric),
therefore, the quality of newly generated results is fundamentally limited by
the performance of such operators. This quality might be even further limited
by the pool of HDR content that is used for training. In this work we propose a
learning-based self-supervised tone mapping operator that is trained at test
time specifically for each HDR image and does not need any data labeling. The
key novelty of our approach is a carefully designed loss function built upon
fundamental knowledge on contrast perception that allows for directly comparing
the content in the HDR and tone mapped images. We achieve this goal by
reformulating classic VGG feature maps into feature contrast maps that
normalize local feature differences by their average magnitude in a local
neighborhood, allowing our loss to account for contrast masking effects. We
perform extensive ablation studies and exploration of parameters and
demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing approaches with a single set
of fixed parameters, as confirmed by both objective and subjective metrics.

interest recently and numerous works aim at putting the predictions of

by recent experimental investigation from the Harvard group reporting
$h/4e$-periodic quartet signal in a four-terminal configuration containing a
loop pierced by magnetic flux, together with inversion controlled by the bias
voltage, i.e. the quartet signal can be larger at half-flux quantum than in
zero magnetic field. Here, we theoretically focus on devices consisting of
finite-size quantum dots connected to four superconducting and to a normal
lead. In addition to presenting numerical calculations of the quartet signal
within a simplified modeling, we reduce the device to a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian in the infinite-gap limit. Then, relaxation has the surprising
effect of producing sharp peaks and log-normal variations in the
voltage-sensitivity of the quartet signal in spite of the expected moderate
fluctuations in the two-terminal DC-Josephson current. The phenomenon is
reminiscent of a resonantly driven harmonic oscillator having amplitude inverse
proportional to the damping rate, and of the thermal noise of a superconducting
weak link, inverse proportional to the Dynes parameter. Perspectives involve
quantum bath engineering multiterminal Josephson junctions in the circuits of
cavity quantum electrodynamics.

change of the hypotheses themselves (not only their credibility) that occurs by

recent trend in the context of Bayes factors for about one decade), rendering a
correct interpretation of the Bayes factor rather useless. Instead, this paper
argues that the inferential foundation of Bayes factors can only be maintained,
if hypotheses are sets of parameters, not parameter distributions. In addition,

object tracking and detection challenging. In this paper, we present our deep
neural network-based combined object detection and tracking model, namely, Heat
Map Network (HM-Net). HM-Net is significantly faster than state-of-the-art
frame differencing and background subtraction-based methods, without
compromising detection and tracking performances. HM-Net follows the object
center-based joint detection and tracking paradigm. Simple heat map-based
predictions support an unlimited number of simultaneous detections. The
proposed method uses two consecutive frames and the object detection heat map
obtained from the previous frame as input, which helps HM-Net monitor
spatio-temporal changes between frames and keeps track of previously predicted
objects. Although reuse of prior object detection heat map acts as a vital
feedback-based memory element, it can lead to an unintended surge of
false-positive detections. To increase the robustness of the method against

novel feedback filters and advanced data augmentations. HM-Net outperforms

conclude that optical pumping techniques must be used to empty the frequency
regions around the qubit transitions from absorption (transmission windows) in
order to suppress the ISD errors. Despite using such windows, there remains a
roughly $0.3\%$ risk that a qubit has an ISD error larger than the error from
other sources. In those cases, the qubit can be discarded and its frequency
channel can be reused by another qubit. However, in most cases the ISD errors
are significantly smaller than other errors, thus opening up the possibility to
perform noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms despite ISD being

recommender systems, which alleviates the closed-loop effects between
recommendation models and user-item interactions. Contextual bandit (CB)
algorithms strive to make a good trade-off between exploration and exploitation
so that users' potential interests have chances to expose. However, classical
CB algorithms can only be applied to a small, sampled item set (usually
hundreds), which forces the typical applications in recommender systems limited
to candidate post-ranking, homepage top item ranking, ad creative selection, or
online model selection (A/B test).
  In this paper, we introduce two simple but effective hierarchical CB
algorithms to make a classical CB model (such as LinUCB and Thompson Sampling)
capable to explore users' interest in the entire item space without limiting it
to a small item set. We first construct a hierarchy item tree via a bottom-up
clustering algorithm to organize items in a coarse-to-fine manner. Then we
propose a hierarchical CB (HCB) algorithm to explore users' interest in the
hierarchy tree. HCB takes the exploration problem as a series of
decision-making processes, where the goal is to find a path from the root to a
leaf node, and the feedback will be back-propagated to all the nodes in the
path. We further propose a progressive hierarchical CB (pHCB) algorithm, which
progressively extends visible nodes which reach a confidence level for
exploration, to avoid misleading actions on upper-level nodes in the sequential
decision-making process. Extensive experiments on two public recommendation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our methods.

methodology lies in the use of flux potentials as control variables and targets
of inequality-constrained optimization problems for numerical fluxes. In
contrast to optimal control via general source terms, the discrete conservation
property of flux-corrected finite element approximations is guaranteed without
the need to impose additional equality constraints. Since the number of flux
potentials is less than the number of fluxes in the multidimensional case, the
potential-based version of optimal flux control involves fewer unknowns than
direct calculation of optimal fluxes. We show that the feasible set of a
potential-state potential-target (PP) optimization problem is nonempty and
choose a primal-dual Newton method for calculating the optimal flux potentials.
The results of numerical studies for linear advection and anisotropic diffusion

time, end time and capacity demands, and treats each sub-request as a regular
VM request. In this way, it can proactively set a bound for each VM request on
each physical machine and makes the scheduler get ready before VM migration to
obtain the predefined load balancing goal, which supports the resource
allocation in a fine-grained manner. Simulations with real-world trace and
synthetic data show that Prepartition for offline (PrepartitionOff) scheduling
has 10%-20% better performance than the existing load balancing algorithms
under several metrics, including average utilization, imbalance degree,
makespan and Capacity_makespan. We also extend Prepartition to online load
balancing. Evaluation results show that our proposed approach also outperforms
existing online algorithms.

synthesize a local closure relation for the pressure tensor and heat flux

foundational layer in the storage stacks of datacenter and cloud services.
Current approaches for achieving reliability and availability avoid replication
at the KV store level and instead perform these operations at higher layers,
e.g., the DB layer that runs on top of the KV store. The main reason is that
past designs for replicated KV stores favor reducing network traffic and
increasing I/O size. Therefore, they perform costly compactions to reorganize
data in both the primary and backup nodes, which hurts overall system
performance.
  In this paper, we design and implement Talos, an efficient rack-scale
LSM-based KV store that aims to significantly reduce the I/O amplification and
CPU overhead in backup nodes and make replication in the KV store practical. We
rely on two observations: (a) the increased use of RDMA in the datacenter,
which reduces CPU overhead for communication, and (b) the use of KV separation
that is becoming prevalent in modern KV stores. We use a primary-backup
replication scheme that performs compactions only on the primary nodes and
sends the pre-built index to the backup nodes of the region, avoiding all
compactions in backups. Our approach includes an efficient mechanism to deal
with pointer translation across nodes in the region index. Our results show
that Talos reduces in the backup nodes, I/O amplification by up to $3\times$,
CPU overhead by up to $1.6\times$, and memory size needed for the write path by
up to $2\times$, without increasing network bandwidth excessively, and by up to
$1.3\times$. Overall, we show that our approach has benefits even when small KV
pairs dominate in a workload (80%-90%). Finally, it enables KV stores to
operate with larger growth factors (from 10 to 16) to reduce space
amplification without sacrificing precious CPU cycles.

shift can lead to substantially degraded performance unless shifts are
well-exercised within the available training environments. We introduce a
simple robust estimation criterion -- transfer risk -- that is specifically
geared towards optimizing transfer to new environments. Effectively, the
criterion amounts to finding a representation that minimizes the risk of
applying any optimal predictor trained on one environment to another. The
transfer risk essentially decomposes into two terms, a direct transfer term and
a weighted gradient-matching term arising from the optimality of
per-environment predictors. Although inspired by IRM, we show that transfer
risk serves as a better out-of-distribution generalization criterion, both
theoretically and empirically. We further demonstrate the impact of optimizing
such transfer risk on two controlled settings, each representing a different
pattern of environment shift, as well as on two real-world datasets.
Experimentally, the approach outperforms baselines across various
out-of-distribution generalization tasks. Code is available at

calculations are used to extend the data points for the fits of the universal
formulae, first proposed in our fourth paper of this series, to predict the IP
and K-threshold lowerings in any elemental ion.
  Methods. We used the fully relativistic multi-configuration Dirac-Fock (MCDF)
method and approximated the plasma electron-nucleus and electron-electron
screenings with a time-averaged Debye-Huckel potential. Results. We report the
modified ionization potentials and K-threshold energies for plasmas
characterized by electron temperatures and densities in the ranges of 10^5-10^7

  Conclusions. We conclude that since explicit calculations of the atomic

impractical, the use of these universal formulae for predicting the IP and
K-threshold lowerings in plasma modeling codes is still recommended. However,
their comparatively moderate to low accuracies may affect the predicted

nucleation of the microdroplets and their organization in droplet plumes is due
to the symmetry breaking of the ethanol concentration field during the
selective evaporation of ethanol from the surrounding ternary liquids into the
growing plasmonic bubbles. Numerical simulations show the existence of a
critical Marangoni number Ma (the ratio between solutal advection rate and the
diffusion rate), above which the symmetry breaking of the ethanol concentration
field occurs, leading to the emission of the droplet plumes. The numerical
results agree with the experimental observation that more plumes are emitted
with increasing ethanol-water relative weight ratios and hence Ma. Our findings

maximizing the sum UL-DL spectral efficiency (SE). We develop a new, low
complexity, greedy algorithm for the combinatorial AP scheduling problem, with
an optimality guarantee theoretically established via showing that a lower
bound of the sum UL-DL SE is sub-modular. We also consider pilot sequence reuse
among the UEs to limit the channel estimation overhead. In CF systems, all the
APs estimate the channel from every UE, making pilot allocation problem
different from the cellular case. We develop a novel algorithm that iteratively
minimizes the maximum pilot contamination across the UEs. We compare the
performance of our solutions, both theoretically and via simulations, against a
full duplex (FD) multi-cell mMIMO system. Our results show that, due to the
joint processing of the signals at the central processing unit, CF-mMIMO with
dynamic HD AP-scheduling significantly outperforms cellular FD-mMIMO in terms
of the sum SE and 90% likely SE. Thus, DTDD enabled HD CF-mMIMO is a promising
alternative to cellular FD-mMIMO, without the cost of hardware for
self-interference suppression.

  22",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The framework of distribution testing is currently ubiquitous in the field of
property testing. In this model, the input is a probability distribution
accessible via independently drawn samples from an oracle. The testing task is
to distinguish a distribution that satisfies some property from a distribution
that is far from satisfying it in the $\ell_1$ distance. The task of tolerant
testing imposes a further restriction, that distributions close to satisfying
the property are also accepted. This work focuses on the connection of the
sample complexities of non-tolerant (""traditional"") testing of distributions
and tolerant testing thereof. When limiting our scope to label-invariant
(symmetric) properties of distribution, we prove that the gap is at most
quadratic. Conversely, the property of being the uniform distribution is indeed
known to have an almost-quadratic gap. When moving to general, not necessarily
label-invariant properties, the situation is more complicated, and we show some
partial results. We show that if a property requires the distributions to be
non-concentrated, then it cannot be non-tolerantly tested with $o(\sqrt{n})$
many samples, where $n$ denotes the universe size. Clearly, this implies at
most a quadratic gap, because a distribution can be learned (and hence
tolerantly tested against any property) using $\mathcal{O}(n)$ many samples.
Being non-concentrated is a strong requirement on the property, as we also
prove a close to linear lower bound against their tolerant tests. To provide
evidence for other general cases (where the properties are not necessarily
label-invariant), we show that if an input distribution is very concentrated,
in the sense that it is mostly supported on a subset of size $s$ of the
universe, then it can be learned using only $\mathcal{O}(s)$ many samples. The
learning procedure adapts to the input, and works without knowing $s$ in
advance.

Specifically, we show that our approach promotes convergence speed for
federated training and yields lower generalization error bound for external

the advantages of our framework. At last, we conduct extensive experiments on
natural and medical images to evaluate our method, where our method achieves

be used to constrain the spatial and temporal distribution of solar coronal
heating. Its manifestations include prominence formation, coronal rain, and
long-period intensity pulsations in coronal loops. The recent observation of
abundant periodic coronal rain associated with intensity pulsations by
Auch\`ere et al. allows to unify these two phenomena as the result of TNE
condensation and evaporation cycles. On the other hand, many intensity
pulsation events observed by Froment et al. show little to no coronal rain
formation. Aims: Our goal is to understand why some TNE cycles produce such
abundant coronal rain, while others produce little to no rain. Methods: We
reconstruct the geometry of the event reported by Auch\`ere et al., using
images from STEREO/SECCHI/EUVI and magnetograms from SDO/HMI. We then perform
1D hydrodynamic simulations of this event, for different heating parameters and
variations of the loop geometry (9000 simulations in total). We compare the
resulting behaviour to simulations of TNE cycles by Froment et al. that do not
produce coronal rain. Results: Our simulations show that both prominences and
TNE cycles (with and without coronal rain) can form within the same magnetic
structure. We show that the formation of coronal rain during TNE cycles depends
on the asymmetry of the loop and of the heating. Asymmetric loops are overall
less likely to produce coronal rain, regardless of the heating. In symmetric
loops, coronal rain forms when the heating is also symmetric. In asymmetric
loops, rain forms only when the heating compensates the asymmetry.

tilted algebras, called dimer tree algebras. The terminology comes from the
fact that these algebras can also be realized as quotients of dimer algebras on
a disc. They are defined by a quiver with potential whose dual graph is a tree,
and they are generally of wild representation type. Given such an algebra $B$,
we construct a polygon $\mathcal{S}$ with a checkerboard pattern in its
interior, that defines a category $\text{Diag}(\mathcal{S})$. The
indecomposable objects of $\text{Diag}(\mathcal{S})$ are the 2-diagonals in
$\mathcal{S}$, and its morphisms are certain pivoting moves between the
2-diagonals. We prove that the category $\text{Diag}(\mathcal{S})$ is
equivalent to the stable syzygy category of the algebra $B$. This result was
conjectured by the authors in an earlier paper, where it was proved in the
special case where every chordless cycle is of length three.
  As a consequence, we conclude that the number of indecomposable syzygies is
finite, and moreover the syzygy category is equivalent to the 2-cluster
category of type $\mathbb{A}$. In addition, we obtain an explicit description
of the projective resolutions, which are periodic. Finally, the number of
vertices of the polygon $\mathcal{S}$ is a derived invariant and a singular
invariant for dimer tree algebras, which can be easily computed form the
quiver.

(SCMA) has been regarded as a promising technology for future wireless
communication systems. However, most of the existing polar-coded SCMA (PC-SCMA)
systems suffer from high latency caused by the feedback iteration and list
decoding. In addition, the error performance of PC-SCMA systems is
unsatisfactory for ultra-reliable transmission. Inspired by the compelling
benefits of non-binary polar codes, in this paper, we design a non-binary
polar-coded SCMA (NB-PC-SCMA) system with a free order matching strategy to
address the issues of delay and reliability. Specifically, we first formulate a
joint factor graph for NB-PC-SCMA and propose a non-binary successive
cancellation list (NB-SCL) and damping based joint iterative detection and
decoding (NSD-JIDD) multiuser receiver to improve the BER and latency
performance. Then, a lazy-search based NB-SCL (L-NB-SCL) decoding is proposed
to reduce the computational complexity by simplifying the path search pattern
of the list decoder. After that, we modify the update of user nodes for SCMA
detection to improve the convergence error and finally propose the improved
NSD-JIDD (ISD-JIDD) algorithm, which can avoid redundant operations by
exploiting L-NB-SCL decoding. Simulation results show that the proposed
NB-PC-SCMA system achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance and
considerable latency gain when compared to its counterparts. In particular, the
proposed ISD-JIDD can achieve similar BER performance of NSD-JIDD with less

relations as the vertices and edges of a directed graph with edge types. KGs
are an important primitive in modern machine learning and artificial
intelligence. Embedding-based models, such as the seminal TransE [Bordes et
al., 2013] and the recent PairRE [Chao et al., 2020] are among the most popular
and successful approaches for representing KGs and inferring missing edges
(link completion). Their relative success is often credited in the literature
to their ability to learn logical rules between the relations.
  In this work, we investigate whether learning rules between relations is
indeed what drives the performance of embedding-based methods. We define motif
learning and two alternative mechanisms, network learning (based only on the
connectivity of the KG, ignoring the relation types), and unstructured
statistical learning (ignoring the connectivity of the graph). Using
experiments on synthetic KGs, we show that KG models can learn motifs and how
this ability is degraded by non-motif (noise) edges. We propose tests to
distinguish the contributions of the three mechanisms to performance, and apply
them to popular KG benchmarks. We also discuss an issue with the standard
performance testing protocol and suggest an improvement.

By their nature frequentist hypothesis-tests yield a dichotomous test decision
as result, rendering them rather inappropriate for latter types of research
questions. Bayes factors, however, are argued to be both able to refrain from
making decisions and to be employed in guiding decisions. This paper elaborates
on how to use a Bayes factor for guiding a decision. In this regard, its
embedding within the framework of Bayesian decision theory is delineated, in
which a (hypothesis-based) loss function needs to be specified. Typically, such
a specification is difficult for an applied scientist as relevant information
might be scarce, vague, partial, and ambiguous. To tackle this issue, a robust,
interval-valued specification of this loss function shall be allowed, such that
the essential but partial information can be included into the analysis as is.
Further, the restriction of the prior distributions to be proper distributions
(which is necessary to calculate Bayes factors) can be alleviated if a decision
is of interest. Both the resulting framework of hypothesis-based Bayesian
decision theory with robust loss function and how to derive optimal decisions
from already existing Bayes factors are depicted by user-friendly and

  Methods: The scenario dose prediction pipeline is divided into the prediction
of nominal dose from input image and the prediction of scenario dose from
nominal dose, each using a deep learning model with U-net architecture. By
using a specially developed dose-volume histogram-based loss function, the
predicted scenario doses are ensured sufficient target coverage despite the
possibility of the training data being non-robust. Deliverable plans may then
be created by solving a robust dose mimicking problem with the predictions as
scenario-specific reference doses.
  Results: Numerical experiments are performed using a dataset of 52
intensity-modulated proton therapy plans for prostate patients. We show that
the predicted scenario doses resemble their respective ground truth well, in
particular while having target coverage comparable to that of the nominal
scenario. The deliverable plans produced by the subsequent robust dose
mimicking were showed to be robust against the same scenario set considered for
prediction.

qualitatively describe the results observed with the original

theoretical calculations of charm-quark transport in a hydrodynamically

framework to simultaneously optimize numeric parameters and compute appropriate
actions to form candidate plans. The gradient-based framework is composed of an
algorithmic heuristic module based on propositional operations to select
actions and generate constraints for gradient descent, an algorithmic
transition module to update states to next ones, and a loss module to compute
loss. We repeatedly minimize loss by updating numeric parameters and compute
candidate plans until it converges into a valid plan for the planning problem.
In the empirical study, we exhibit that our algorithm framework is both

ease this process, a computationally efficient and noise-resistant method for
determining whether an audio segment contains a potential cetacean call is
developed here with the help of a robust power calculation for stationary
Gaussian noise signals and a recursive method for determining the mean and
variance of a given sample frame. The resulting detector is tested on audio
recordings containing southern right whale sounds and its performance is
compared to a contemporary energy detector and a popular deep learning method.
The detector exhibits good performance at moderate-to-high signal-to-noise
ratio values. The detector succeeds in being easy to implement, computationally
efficient to use and robust enough to accurately detect whale vocalizations in
a noisy underwater environment.

reverse-drifting (RS) type III bursts, intermittent sequence of type U bursts,
drifting pulsation structure (DPS), and fine structures were observed by the
Yunnan Observatories Solar Radio Spectrometer(YNSRS). Combined information
revealed by the multi-wavelength data indicated that after the DPS which
observed by YNSRS, the generation rate of type U bursts suddenly increased 5
times than before. In this event, the generation rate of type U bursts may
depend on the magnetic reconnection rate. Our observations are consistent with
previous numerical simulations results. After the first plasmoid produced
(plasma instability occurred), the magnetic reconnection rate increased
suddenly 5-8 times than before. Furthermore, after the DPS, the frequency range
of turnover frequency of type U bursts is obviously broadened 3 times than
before, which indicates the fluctuation amplitude of the density in the
loop-top. Our observations also support the numerical simulations during the
flare impulsive phase. The turbulence occurs at the top of the flare loop, the
plasmoids can trap the non-thermal particles and cause the density fluctuation
at the loop-top. The observations are generally consistent with the results of
numerical simulations, helping us to better understand the characteristics of
the whole physical process of eruption.

problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL). This is known as ""off-policy control""
in RL where an agent's objective is to compute an optimal policy based on the
data obtained from the given policy (known as the behavior policy). As the
optimal policy can be very different from the behavior policy, learning optimal
behavior is very hard in the ""off-policy"" setting compared to the ""on-policy""
setting where new data from the policy updates will be utilized in learning.
This work proposes an off-policy natural actor-critic algorithm that utilizes
state-action distribution correction for handling the off-policy behavior and
the natural policy gradient for sample efficiency. The existing natural
gradient-based actor-critic algorithms with convergence guarantees require
fixed features for approximating both policy and value functions. This often
leads to sub-optimal learning in many RL applications. On the other hand, our
proposed algorithm utilizes compatible features that enable one to use
arbitrary neural networks to approximate the policy and the value function and
guarantee convergence to a locally optimal policy. We illustrate the benefit of
the proposed off-policy natural gradient algorithm by comparing it with the
vanilla gradient actor-critic algorithm on benchmark RL tasks.

often requires leaving the parametric world for the nonparametric. In the
latter, parameters are infinite dimensional objects such as functions,
probability distributions or infinite vectors. In the Bayesian nonparametric
approach, prior distributions are designed for these parameters, which provide
a handle to manage the complexity of nonparametric models in practice. However,
most modern Bayesian nonparametric models seem often out of reach to
practitioners, as inference algorithms need careful design to deal with the
infinite number of parameters. The aim of this work is to facilitate the
journey by providing computational tools for Bayesian nonparametric inference.
The article describes a set of functions available in the \R package BNPdensity
in order to carry out density estimation with an infinite mixture model,
including all types of censored data. The package provides access to a large
class of such models based on normalized random measures, which represent a
generalization of the popular Dirichlet process mixture. One striking advantage
of this generalization is that it offers much more robust priors on the number
of clusters than the Dirichlet. Another crucial advantage is the complete
flexibility in specifying the prior for the scale and location parameters of
the clusters, because conjugacy is not required. Inference is performed using a
theoretically grounded approximate sampling methodology known as the Ferguson &
Klass algorithm. The package also offers several goodness of fit diagnostics
such as QQ-plots, including a cross-validation criterion, the conditional
predictive ordinate. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a classical
ecological risk assessment method called the Species Sensitivity Distribution
(SSD) problem, showcasing the benefits of the Bayesian nonparametric framework.

well-posedness is the introduction of the dissipation-normalized Bourgain
spaces which allows one to gain smoothing properties simultaneously from the
dissipation and dispersion present in the equation. Finally, the local
exponential stabilizability result is accomplished taking into account the
decay of the associated semigroup combined with the fixed point argument.

for rapid quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) with periods of order seconds in
flare lightcurves. However, most theories of FSMs in solar coronal cylinders
assume a perfectly axisymmetric equilibrium, an idealized configuration
apparently far from reality. In particular, it remains to examine whether FSMs
exist in coronal cylinders with fine structures. Working in the framework of
ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we numerically follow the response to an
axisymmetric perturbation of a coronal cylinder for which a considerable number
of randomly distributed fine structures are superposed on an axisymmetric
background. The parameters for the background component are largely motivated
by the recent IRIS identification of a candidate FSM in Fe XXI 1354
\AA~observations. We find that the composite cylinder rapidly settles to an
oscillatory behavior largely compatible with a canonical trapped FSM. This
happens despite that kink-like motions develop in the fine structures. We
further synthesize the Fe XXI 1354 \AA~emissions, finding that the transverse
Alfv\'en time characterizes the periodicities in the intensity, Doppler shift,
and Doppler width signals. Distinct from the case without fine structuring, a
non-vanishing Doppler shift is seen even at the apex. We conclude that
density-enhanced equilibria need not be strictly axisymmetric to host FSM-like
motions in general, and FSMs remain a candidate interpretation for rapid QPPs
in solar flares.

below the saturation density. In the compact fission mode, nuclear density may
go down to half of the saturation density before the rupture of the neck.

of mechanical cues in both brain function and form. Specifically, capturing the
heterogeneous and anisotropic behaviour of cerebral white matter (WM) is
extremely challenging and yet the data on WM at a spatial resolution relevant
to tissue components are sparse. To investigate the time-dependent mechanical
behaviour of WM, and its dependence on local microstructural features when
subjected to small deformations, we conducted atomic force microscopy (AFM)
stress relaxation experiments on corpus callosum (CC), corona radiata (CR) and
fornix (FO) of fresh ovine brain. Our experimental results show a dependency of
the tissue mechanical response on axons orientation, with e.g. the stiffness of
perpendicular and parallel samples is different in all three regions of WM
whereas the relaxation behaviour is different for the CC and FO regions. An
inverse modelling approach was adopted to extract Prony series parameters of
the tissue components, i.e. axons and extra cellular matrix with its accessory
cells, from experimental data. Using a bottom-up approach, we developed
analytical and FEA estimates that are in good agreement with our experimental
results. Our systematic characterisation of sheep brain WM using a combination
of AFM experiments and micromechanical models provide a significant
contribution for predicting localised time-dependent mechanics of brain tissue.
This information can lead to more accurate computational simulations, therefore
aiding the development of surgical robotic solutions for drug delivery and
accurate tissue mimics, as well as the determination of criteria for tissue
injury and predict brain development and disease progression.

This means that we must have more accurate theoretical predictions to compare

of the redshift space distortions (RSD) of small-scale galaxy clustering in
modified gravity (MG) cosmologies, we investigate the validity of the so-called
Skew-T (ST) probability distribution function (PDF) of halo pairwise peculiar
velocities in these models. We show that, combined with the streaming model of
RSD, the ST PDF substantially improves the small-scale predictions by
incorporating skewness and kurtosis, for both $\Lambda$CDM and two leading MG
models: $f(R)$ gravity and the DGP braneworld model. The ST model reproduces
the velocity PDF and redshift-space halo clustering measured from MG $N$-body
simulations very well down to $\sim 5 \, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. In particular, we
investigate the enhancements of halo pairwise velocity moments with respect to
$\Lambda$CDM for a larger range of MG variants than previous works, and present
simple explanations to the behaviours observed. By performing a simple Fisher
analysis, we find a significnat increase in constraining power to detect
modifications of General Relativity by introducing small-scale information in
the RSD analyses.

interactive safety and dexterity. Hybrid gripper (soft actuators enhanced by

components actuated by soft actuators, they could achieve excellent grasping
adaptability and payload, while also being easy to model and control with
conventional kinematics. However, existing works were mostly focused on
achieving superior payload and perception with simple planar workspaces,
resulting in far less dexterity compared with conventional grippers. In this
work, we took inspiration from the human Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and
proposed a new hybrid gripper design with 8 independent muscles. It was shown
that adding the MCP complexity was critical in enabling a range of novel
features in the hybrid gripper, including in-hand manipulation, lateral passive
compliance, as well as new control modes. A prototype gripper was fabricated
and tested on our proprietary dual-arm robot platform with vision guided
grasping. With very lightweight pneumatic bellows soft actuators, the gripper
could grasp objects over 25 times its own weight with lateral compliance. Using
the dual-arm platform, highly anthropomorphic dexterous manipulations were
demonstrated using two hybrid grippers, from Tug-of-war on a rigid rod, to
passing a soft towel between two grippers using in-hand manipulation. Matching
with the novel features and performance specifications of the proposed hybrid

dynamics (RD), the best response (BR), and the unconditional imitation (UI) --
for coordination games on random graphs. Local effects turn out to me
significantly more important for the UI update rule. For the pure coordination
game with two equivalent strategies we find a transition from a disordered
state to a state of full coordination for a critical value of the network
connectivity. The transition is system-size-independent for the BR and RD
update rules. For the IU update rule it is system size dependent, but
coordination can always be reached below the connectivity of a complete graph.
We also consider the general coordination game which covers a range of games,
such as the stag hunt. For these games there is a payoff-dominant strategy and
a risk-dominant strategy with associated states of equilibrium coordination. We
analyse equilibrium selection analytically and numerically. For the RD and BR
update rules mean-field predictions agree with simulations and the
risk-dominant strategy is evolutionary favoured independently of local effects.
When players use the unconditional imitation, however, we observe coordination
in the payoff-dominant strategy. Surprisingly, the selection of pay-off
dominant equilibrium only occurs below a critical value of the network
connectivity and it disappears in complete graphs. As we show, it is a
combination of local effects and update rule that allows for coordination on

periodicity and the group of color transformations, isomorphic to O(2), and
study the equivariant bifurcations of its stationary solutions when some

the Equivariant Branching Lemma (EBL) by determining the axial subgroups of G .
These define bifurcated solutions which are invariant under the action of the
corresponding axial subgroup. We compute analytically these solutions and

bifurcation analysis we then explore the persistence and stability of these

path planning in complex environments. Most existing path planning algorithms
are difficult to quickly find a feasible path in complex environments or even

learning-based prediction module and a sampling-based path planning module. The
prediction module utilizes an auto-encoder-decoder-like convolutional neural
network (CNN) to output a promising region where the feasible path probably
lies in. In this process, the environment is treated as an RGB image to feed in
our designed CNN module, and the output is also an RGB image. No extra
computation is required so that we can maintain a high processing speed of 60
frames-per-second (FPS). Incorporated with a sampling-based path planner, we
can extract a feasible path from the output image so that the robot can track
it from start to goal. To demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm,
we compare it with conventional path planning algorithms in a series of

nonstationary behavior in the bulk of the distribution, such as seasonality or
climate change, will also be observed in the tails. To accurately model such

embedding represents each node of a graph as a d-dimensional vector which is
more suitable for ML tasks. However, the embedding process is expensive, and
CPU-based tools do not scale to real-world graphs. In this work, we present
GOSH, a GPU-based tool for embedding large-scale graphs with minimum hardware
constraints. GOSH employs a novel graph coarsening algorithm to enhance the
impact of updates and minimize the work for embedding. It also incorporates a
decomposition schema that enables any arbitrarily large graph to be embedded
with a single GPU. As a result, GOSH sets a new state-of-the-art in link
prediction both in accuracy and speed, and delivers high-quality embeddings for
node classification at a fraction of the time compared to the state-of-the-art.
For instance, it can embed a graph with over 65 million vertices and 1.8
billion edges in less than 30 minutes on a single GPU.

We
studied the continuum and line profile variations of this object with high

to derive its BH mass. We carried out a high-cadence spectroscopic variability
campaign of Mrk926 with the 10m HET telescope, aided by photometric V-band data
taken at the Wise Observatory, over a period of about five months. We extracted
spectroscopic continuum and line light curves, and computed CCFs as well as
velocity-resolved CCFs with respect to the combined continuum V-band light
curve. The continuum luminosity of Mrk926 showed a drastic decrease during our
campaign: it dropped to less than 50% of its original value within only 2.5
months. The spectra show complex and very broad Balmer line profiles, including
outer Balmer satellites ranging from +-5000 to +-13,000 kms-1. The Ha, Hb, and
HeI5876 line light curves are delayed relative to the continuum light curve.
The Ha and Hb lines show two velocity-delay structures in the central part of
their line profile (within +- 5000 kms-1), at ~10 and ~57 ld and at ~5 and ~48
ld, respectively. These structures might be interpreted as the signature of a
line-emitting ring, inclined by ~50 deg to the line of sight and orbiting the
BH at radii, R, of 33.5 and 26.5 ld. We determined continuum luminosities,
log(lambda\,L_(lambda)/erg s-1), of 43.68 to 44.13, which are in good agreement
with the established R_(BLR)-L_(AGN) relation. We derive a black hole mass of
1.1 +- 0.2 * 10^8 M_solar; this indicates a low Eddington ratio, which
decreased from 8 to 3 percent during our campaign. The Balmer satellite
components show a response to the continuum variations on the order of only 3-5
days. We attribute this to the central line segment and the Balmer satellites
having different, spatially distinct regions of origin.

multiple services to the electrical grid. The framework is designed to dispatch
the operation of a distribution feeder hosting heterogeneous prosumers
according to a dispatch plan and provide frequency containment reserve and
voltage control as additional services. The framework consists of three phases.
In the day-ahead scheduling phase, a robust optimization problem is solved to
compute the optimal dispatch plan and frequency droop coefficient, accounting
for the uncertainty of the aggregated prosumption. In the intra-day phase, a
model predictive control algorithm is used to compute the power set-point for
the BESS to achieve the tracking of the dispatch plan. Finally, in a real-time
stage, the power setpoint originated by the dispatch tracking is converted into
a feasible frequency set-point for the grid forming converter by means of a
convex optimisation problem accounting for the capability curve of the power
converter. The proposed framework is experimentally validated by using a
grid-scale 720 kVA/560 kWh BESS connected to a 20 kV distribution feeder of the
EPFL hosting stochastic prosumption and PV generation.

process known as interfacial premelting. The thickness of the melt film depends
on the temperature, impurities, material properties and geometry. A temperature
gradient is accompanied by a thermomolecular pressure gradient that drives the
interfacial liquid from high to low temperatures and hence the particle from
low to high temperatures, in a process called thermal regelation. When the host
material is ice and the embedded particle is a biological entity, one has a
particularly novel form of active matter, which addresses interplay between a
wide range of problems, from extremophiles of both terrestrial and
exobiological relevance to ecological dynamics in Earth's cryosphere. Of basic
importance in all such settings is the combined influence of biological
activity and thermal regelation in controlling the redistribution of
bioparticles. Therefore, we re-cast this class of regelation phenomena in the

solution-processed 2D GaS-based PEC-type photodetectors outperform the
corresponding solid-state photodetectors. In fact, the 2D morphology of the GaS
flakes intrinsically minimizes the distance between the photogenerated charges
and the surface area at which the redox reactions occur, limiting electron-hole
recombination losses. The latter are instead deleterious for standard
solid-state configurations. Consequently, PEC-type 2D GaS photodetectors
display a relevant UV-selective photoresponse. In particular, they attain
responsivities of 1.8 mA W-1 in 1 M H2SO4 (at 0.8 V vs reversible hydrogen
electrode -RHE-), 4.6 mA W-1 in 1 M Na2SO4 (at 0.9 V vs RHE), and 6.8 mA W-1 in
1 M KOH (at 1.1 V vs RHE) under 275 nm illumination wavelength with an

of the atmospheric boundary layer, with the immense advantage of long-range and
all-weather operation capability. One of their main limitations, however, is a
relatively long integration time compared to other instruments such as lidars.
In the context of L-band RWP we show that the use of Autoregressive (AR)
modeling for the antenna signals combined with the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM)
allows for a correct estimation of radial wind velocity profiles even with very
short time samples. A systematical analysis of performance is made with the
help of synthetic data. These numerical results are further confirmed by an
experimental dataset acquired near the landing runways of Paris Charles de
Gaulle (CDG) Airport, France, and validated using a colocated optical lidar at
the Aerological station of Payerne, Switzerland. It is found that the AR-MEM
approach can successfully derive reliable wind estimates using integration
times as short as 2.5 s where the classical spectral approach can barely
provide any measurement. In addition, the technique helps mitigating the impact
of uncooperative flyers in the processing of the atmospheric echo, leading to a
more successful application of the wind estimation algorithm.

adverse consequences of stroke have led to global interest and work for
improving the management and diagnosis of stroke. Various techniques for data

thousands of features and most of them are redundant and irrelevant that need
to be discarded to enhance the prediction accuracy. The choice of
feature-selection methods can help in improving the prediction accuracy of the

paper, we systematically analyze the various features in EHR records for the
detection of stroke. We propose a novel rough-set based technique for ranking
the importance of the various EHR records in detecting stroke. Unlike the
conventional rough-set techniques, our proposed technique can be applied on any

hardware, these benefits will be especially prominent if coarse-grained
structures, like feature maps, are pruned. We devise two novel saliency-based
methods for second-order structured pruning (SOSP) which include correlations
among all structures and layers. Our main method SOSP-H employs an innovative
second-order approximation, which enables saliency evaluations by fast
Hessian-vector products. SOSP-H thereby scales like a first-order method
despite taking into account the full Hessian. We validate SOSP-H by comparing
it to our second method SOSP-I that uses a well-established Hessian
approximation, and to numerous state-of-the-art methods. While SOSP-H performs
on par or better in terms of accuracy, it has clear advantages in terms of
scalability and efficiency. This allowed us to scale SOSP-H to large-scale
vision tasks, even though it captures correlations across all layers of the
network. To underscore the global nature of our pruning methods, we evaluate
their performance not only by removing structures from a pretrained network,
but also by detecting architectural bottlenecks. We show that our algorithms
allow to systematically reveal architectural bottlenecks, which we then remove
to further increase the accuracy of the networks.

difficult. To address these shortcomings, optimal decision trees have been
recently proposed in the literature, which use discrete decision variables to
model the path each observation will follow in the tree. Instead, we propose a
new approach based on continuous optimization. Our classifier can be seen as a
randomized tree, since at each node of the decision tree a random decision is
made. The computational experience reported demonstrates the good performance
of our procedure.

answer. While traditional algorithms have been successful in solving linear
problems, its success often depends on choosing the right features from a
dataset, which can be a challenge for nuanced financial planning scenarios.
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning approach that can be employed with
complex data sets where picking the right features can be nearly impossible. In
this paper, we will explore the use of machine learning for financial
forecasting, predicting economic indicators, and creating a savings strategy.
Vanguard ML algorithm for goals-based financial planning is based on deep
reinforcement learning that identifies optimal savings rates across multiple
goals and sources of income to help clients achieve financial success. Vanguard
learning algorithms are trained to identify market indicators and behaviors too
complex to capture with formulas and rules, instead, it works to model the
financial success trajectory of investors and their investment outcomes as a
Markov decision process. We believe that reinforcement learning can be used to
create value for advisors and end-investors, creating efficiency, more
personalized plans, and data to enable customized solutions.

Schollmeyer and Augustin (2018, Int. J. Approx. Reason), we now design
elicitation procedures and algorithms that enable decision makers to reveal
their underlying preference system (i.e. two relations, one encoding the
ordinal, the other the cardinal part of the preferences) while having to answer
as few as possible simple ranking questions. Here, two different approaches are
followed. The first approach directly utilizes the collected ranking data for
obtaining the ordinal part of the preferences, while their cardinal part is
constructed implicitly by measuring meta data on the decision maker's
consideration times. In contrast, the second approach explicitly elicits also
the cardinal part of the decision maker's preference system, however, only an
approximate version of it. This approximation is obtained by additionally
collecting labels of preference strength during the elicitation procedure. For
both approaches, we give conditions under which they produce the decision
maker's true preference system and investigate how their efficiency can be
improved. For the latter purpose, besides data-free approaches, we also discuss
ways for effectively guiding the elicitation procedure if data from previous
elicitation rounds is available. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed
elicitation methods can be utilized in problems of decision under (severe)
uncertainty. Precisely, we show that under certain conditions optimal decisions
can be found without fully specifying the preference system.

complexity of dynamical field equations, we propose some ansatz forms of

of Lagrangian is capable to reproduce bouncing solution via analytical

matter bounce models, it is possible to get analytical solution while in other
cases, it is not possible to achieve exact solutions so only complementary
solutions can be discussed. However, for power law model, all forms of generic

linear forms of Lagrangian only but the reconstructed solutions for power law

mitigation of impact, appeal mechanisms, timeline, post-deprecation protocols,
and publication checks that can be adapted and implemented by the ML community.
Finally, we propose creating a centralized, sustainable repository system for
archiving datasets, tracking dataset modifications or deprecations, and
facilitating practices of care and stewardship that can be integrated into
research and publication processes.

$\delta$-tubes and $\delta$-balls in the plane, where the $\delta$-tubes
satisfy an $\alpha$-dimensional spacing condition and the $\delta$-balls
satisfy a $\beta$-dimensional spacing condition. Our approach combines a
combinatorial argument for small $\alpha, \beta$ and a Fourier analytic
argument for large $\alpha, \beta$. As an application, we prove a new lower
bound for the size of a $(u,v)$-Furstenberg set when $v \ge 1, u + \frac{v}{2}
\ge 1$, which is sharp when $u + v \ge 2$. We also show a new lower bound for
the discretized sum-product problem.

field that attracts researchers from across a spectrum of disciplines and
domains. Here we report a time-series analysis for predicting events. In
particular, we evaluated the frequency distribution of top n-grams of terms
over time, focusing on two indicators: high-frequency n-grams over both short
and long periods of time. Both indicators can refer to certain aspects of
events as they evolve. To evaluate the models accuracy in detecting events, we
built and used a Twitter dataset of the most popular hashtags that surrounded
the well-documented protests that occurred at the University of Missouri
(Mizzou) in late 2015.

  Detection Systems","This paper has not been published in any conferences or publications",,,,"physics.ins-det nucl-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Aerial source detection systems have the capability to rapidly provide
radiological data over a large area of land. Sodium Iodine (NaI) scintillator
based aerial radiation detection systems of compact physical sizes have the
potential aid nuclear security applications in a cost-effective manner when
deployed on aerial vehicle systems. The Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) of
NaI scintillator airborne detectors is qualitatively evaluated as a function of
detector-source distance and as a function of detector-source relative speed.
It is found that the MDA increases exponentially with vehicle height and that
MDA increases directly proportionally with the relative speed plus the square
root of the relative speed. Furthermore, detection limits of an aerial
detection system are evaluated in a case study. MDA is evaluated for the
nuclear materials U-238 and Pu-239 as defined by the IAEA Safeguards Glossary
Table II and MDA is evaluated for arbitrarily selected isotopes found in Table
I.2 of the IAEA document TECDOC-1344.

  intertemporal social dilemma tasks","Intertemporal social dilemma, Multi-agent reinforcement learning,
  Exploration- exploitation",,,,"cs.MA cs.AI cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  When an individual's behavior has rational characteristics, this may lead to
irrational collective actions for the group. A wide range of organisms from
animals to humans often evolve the social attribute of cooperation to meet this
challenge. Therefore, cooperation among individuals is of great significance
for allowing social organisms to adapt to changes in the natural environment.
Based on multi-agent reinforcement learning, we propose a new learning strategy
for achieving coordination by incorporating a learning rate that can balance
exploration and exploitation. We demonstrate that agents that use the simple
strategy improve a relatively collective return in a decision task called the
intertemporal social dilemma, where the conflict between the individual and the
group is particularly sharp. We also explore the effects of the diversity of
learning rates on the population of reinforcement learning agents and show that
agents trained in heterogeneous populations develop particularly coordinated
policies relative to those trained in homogeneous populations.

  Systems","Submitted to IEEE Communications Magazine",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) will play a key role in 6G
communication systems. They are considered a promising technology to enhance
the network capacity in highly dense agglomerations and to provide connectivity
in rural areas. The multi-layer and heterogeneous nature of SAGINs necessitates
an innovative design of their multi-tier associations. We propose a modeling of
the SAGINs association problem using multi-sided matching theory. Our aim is to
provide a reliable, asynchronous and fully distributed approach that associates
nodes across the layers so that the total end-to-end rate of the assigned
agents is maximized. To this end, our problem is modeled as a multi-sided
many-to-one matching game. A randomized matching algorithm with low information
exchange is proposed. The algorithm is shown to reach an efficient and stable
association between nodes in adjacent layers. Our simulation results show that
the proposed approach achieves significant gain compared to the greedy and
distance-based algorithms.
