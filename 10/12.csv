thousands of developers. This complex collaboration structure makes developers
more likely to introduce defect-prone changes that lead to software faults.
Determining when these defect-prone changes are introduced has proven
challenging, and using traditional machine learning (ML) methods to make these
determinations seems to have reached a plateau. In this work, we build
contribution graphs consisting of developers and source files to capture the
nuanced complexity of changes required to build software. By leveraging these
contribution graphs, our research shows the potential of using graph-based ML
to improve Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. We hypothesize that features
extracted from the contribution graphs may be better predictors of defect-prone
changes than intrinsic features derived from software characteristics. We
corroborate our hypothesis using graph-based ML for classifying edges that
represent defect-prone changes. This new framing of the JIT defect prediction
problem leads to remarkably better results. We test our approach on 14
open-source projects and show that our best model can predict whether or not a
code change will lead to a defect with an F1 score as high as 77.55% and a
Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as high as 53.16%. This represents a
152% higher F1 score and a 3% higher MCC over the state-of-the-art JIT defect
prediction. We describe limitations, open challenges, and how this method can
be used for operational JIT defect prediction.

  Singular Value Analysis?","Accepted for IEEE CDC 2021",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of robust performance of quantum systems under
structured uncertainties. A specific feature of closed (Hamiltonian) quantum
systems is that their poles lie on the imaginary axis and that neither a
coherent controller nor physically relevant structured uncertainties can alter
this situation. This changes for open systems where decoherence ensures
asymptotic stability and creates a unique landscape of pure performance
robustness, with the distinctive feature that closed-loop stability is secured
by the underlying physics and needs not be enforced. This stability, however,
is often detrimental to quantum-enhanced performance, and additive
perturbations of the Hamiltonian give rise to dynamic generators that are
nonlinear in the perturbed parameters, invalidating classical paradigms to
assess robustness to structured perturbations such as singular value analysis.
This problem is addressed using a fixed-point iteration approach to determine a
maximum perturbation strength $\delta_{\max}$ that ensures that the transfer
function remains bounded, $||T_\delta||<\delta^{-1}$ for
$\delta<\delta_{\max}$.

redshift Universe, most of this gas infall is expected to be dominated by cold
filamentary flows which connect deep down inside halos, and, hence, to the
vicinity of galaxies. Such cold flows are important since they dominate the
mass and angular momentum acquisition that can make up rotationally-supported
disks at high-redshifts. We study the angular momentum acquisition of gas into
galaxies, and in particular, the torques acting on the accretion flows, using
hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of high-resolution zoomed-in halos of a
few $10^{11}\,\rm M_\odot$ at $z=2$. Torques can be separated into those of
gravitational origin, and hydrodynamical ones driven by pressure gradients. We
find that coherent gravitational torques dominate over pressure torques in the
cold phase, and are hence responsible for the spin-down and realignment of this
gas. Pressure torques display small-scale fluctuations of significant
amplitude, but with very little coherence on the relevant galaxy or halo-scale
that would otherwise allow them to effectively re-orientate the gas flows. Dark
matter torques dominate gravitational torques outside the galaxy, while within
the galaxy, the baryonic component dominates. The circum-galactic medium
emerges as the transition region for angular momentum re-orientation of the
cold component towards the central galaxy's mid-plane.

camera wearer will likely perform based on past video observations. While in a
real-world system it is fundamental to output such predictions before the
action begins, past works have not generally paid attention to model runtime
during evaluation. Indeed, current evaluation schemes assume that predictions
can be made offline, and hence that computational resources are not limited. In
contrast, in this paper, we propose a ""streaming"" egocentric action
anticipation evaluation protocol which explicitly considers model runtime for
performance assessment, assuming that predictions will be available only after
the current video segment is processed, which depends on the processing time of
a method. Following the proposed evaluation scheme, we benchmark different
state-of-the-art approaches for egocentric action anticipation on two popular
datasets. Our analysis shows that models with a smaller runtime tend to
outperform heavier models in the considered streaming scenario, thus changing
the rankings generally observed in standard offline evaluations. Based on this
observation, we propose a lightweight action anticipation model consisting in a
simple feed-forward 3D CNN, which we propose to optimize using knowledge
distillation techniques and a custom loss. The results show that the proposed
approach outperforms prior art in the streaming scenario, also in combination

grid of BESSs providing frequency regulation to bulk power systems. Specific
metrics are proposed to compare the performance of grid-forming and
grid-following control. Experimental results are obtained taking advantage of a
720 kVA/500 kWh BESS connected to the 20 kV distribution grid of the EPFL
campus. The quantitative evaluation based on suitably proposed metrics confirms
the superior performance of the grid-forming strategy, compared to the
grid-following one.

(CS) gauge theories, where the CS term can retain the gauge symmetry and make
gauge boson topologically massive. Without CS term the 3d massless gauge boson
has a single physical transverse polarization state, while adding the CS term
converts it into a massive physical polarization state and conserves the total
physical degrees of freedom. We newly formulate the mechanism of topological
mass-generation at $S$-matrix level. For this, we propose and prove a new
Topological Equivalence Theorem (TET) which connects the $N$-point scattering
amplitude of the gauge boson's physical polarization states ($A^a_{\rm{P}}$) to
that of the transverse polarization states ($A^a_{\rm{T}}$) under high energy
expansion. We present a general 3d power counting method on the leading energy
dependence of $N$-point scattering amplitudes in both topologically massive
Yang-Mills (TMYM) and topologically massive gravity (TMG) theories. With these,
we uncover a general energy cancellation mechanism for $N$-gauge boson
scattering amplitudes which predicts the cancellation $E^4 \to E^{4-N}$ at tree

$A^a_{\rm{T}}$'s, with which we explicitly demonstrate the TET and establish
such energy cancellations. We further extend the double-copy approach and
construct the four-point massive graviton amplitude of the TMG theory from the
massive gauge boson amplitude of the TMYM theory. With these, we newly uncover
striking large energy cancellations $E^{12}\to E^1$ in the four-graviton
amplitude of the TMG, and establish its new correspondence to the leading

  noise modelling",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Purpose: Magnitude-based fitting of chemical shift-encoded data enables
proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and R2* estimation where complex-based
methods fail or when phase data is inaccessible or unreliable, such as in
multi-centre studies. However, traditional magnitude-based fitting algorithms
suffer from Rician noise-related bias and fat-water swaps. To address these
issues, we propose an algorithm for Magnitude-Only PDFF and R2* estimation with
Rician Noise modelling (MAGORINO).
  Methods: Simulations of multi-echo gradient echo signal intensities are used
to investigate the performance and behavior of MAGORINO over the space of
clinically plausible PDFF, R2* and SNR values. Fitting performance is assessed
in terms of parameter bias, precision and fitting error. To gain deeper
insights into algorithm behavior, the paths on the likelihood functions are
visualized and statistics describing correct optimization are generated.
MAGORINO is compared against Gaussian noise-based magnitude fitting and complex
fitting.
  Results: Simulations show that MAGORINO reduces bias in both PDFF and R2*
measurements compared to Gaussian fitting, through two main mechanisms: (i) a
greater chance of selecting the true (non-swapped) optimum, and (ii) a shift in
the position of the optima such that the estimates are closer to ground truth
solutions, as a result of the correct noise model.
  Conclusion: MAGORINO reduces fat-water swaps and Rician noise-related bias in
PDFF and R2* estimation, thus addressing key limitations of traditional
Gaussian noise-based magnitude-only fitting.

alternation of letters in words. Word-representable graphs generalise several
important and well-studied classes of graphs, and they can be characterised by
semi-transitive orientations. Recognising word-representability is an
NP-complete problem, and the bottleneck of the theory of word-representable
graphs is how to convince someone, e.g.\ a referee, that a graph is
non-word-representable keeping in mind that references to (publicly available)
software are not always welcome? (Word-representability can be justified by
providing a semi-transitive orientation as a certificate that can be checked in
polynomial time.)
  In the literature, a variety of (usually ad hoc) proofs of
non-word-representability for particular graphs, or families of graphs, appear,
but for a randomly selected graph, one should expect looking at
$O(2^{\#\mbox{edges}})$ orientations and justifying that none of them is
semi-transitive. Even if computer would print out all these orientations and
would point out what is wrong with each of the orientations, such a proof would
be essentially non-checkable by a human.

``short'' proofs of non-word-representability, generated automatically by our

Hughes. Recently, Forrester considered the analogous problem for the Circular

additional complex parameter $\delta$ and we prove convergence of the joint

results on consistent probability measures on interlacing arrays. Using these

theoretical limit on the expressivity of Softmax-based models. Being one of the
most widely-used methods to output probability, Softmax-based models have found
a wide range of applications, including session-based recommender systems
(SBRSs). Softmax-based models consist of a Softmax function on top of a final
linear layer. The bottleneck has been shown to be caused by rank deficiency in
the final linear layer due to its connection with matrix factorization. In this
paper, we show that there are more aspects to the Softmax bottleneck in SBRSs.
Contrary to common beliefs, overfitting does happen in the final linear layer,
while it is often associated with complex networks. Furthermore, we identified
that the common technique of sharing item embeddings among session sequences
and the candidate pool creates a tight-coupling that also contributes to the
bottleneck. We propose a simple yet effective method, Dropout and Decoupling
(D&D), to alleviate these problems. Our experiments show that our method
significantly improves the accuracy of a variety of Softmax-based SBRS
algorithms. When compared to other computationally expensive methods, such as
MLP and MoS (Mixture of Softmaxes), our method performs on par with and at
times even better than those methods, while keeping the same time complexity as

treatment planning, combining ideas from machine learning-automated planning
and multicriteria optimization (MCO).
  Approach: Using knowledge extracted from historically delivered plans,
prediction models for spatial dose and dose statistics are trained and
furthermore systematically modified to simulate changes in tradeoff priorities,
creating a set of differently biased predictions. Based on the predictions, an
MCO problem is subsequently constructed using previously developed dose
mimicking functions, designed in such a way that its Pareto surface spans the
range of clinically acceptable yet realistically achievable plans as exactly as
possible. The result is an algorithm outputting a set of Pareto optimal plans,
either fluence-based or machine parameter-based, which the user can navigate
between in real time to make adjustments before a final deliverable plan is
created.
  Main results: Numerical experiments performed on a dataset of prostate cancer
patients show that one may often navigate to a better plan than one produced by
a single-plan-output algorithm.
  Significance: We demonstrate the potential of merging MCO and a data-driven
workflow to automate labor-intensive parts of the treatment planning process
while maintaining a certain extent of manual control for the user.

model of classical linear logic and its differential structure. This leads to
constructively establishing that free commutative monoids are conical
refinement monoids. Thereon we obtain a characterisation of the equality type
of finite multisets and a new presentation of the free commutative-monoid
construction as a set-quotient of the list construction. These developments
crucially rely on the commutation relation of creation/annihilation operators
associated with the free commutative-monoid construction seen as a
combinatorial Fock space.

  Insights from machine learning techniques","Under review for presentation at TRB 2022 Annual Meeting",,,,"stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Surface roughness is primary measure of pavement performance that has been
associated with ride quality and vehicle operating costs. Of all the surface
roughness indicators, the International Roughness Index (IRI) is the most
widely used. However, it is costly to measure IRI, and for this reason, certain
road classes are excluded from IRI measurements at a network level. Higher
levels of distresses are generally associated with higher roughness. However,
for a given roughness level, pavement data typically exhibits a great deal of
variability in the distress types, density, and severity. It is hypothesized
that it is feasible to estimate the IRI of a pavement section given its
distress types and their respective densities and severities. To investigate
this hypothesis, this paper uses data from in-service pavements and machine
learning methods to ascertain the extent to which IRI can be predicted given a
set of pavement attributes. The results suggest that machine learning can be
used reliably to estimate IRI based on the measured distress types and their
respective densities and severities. The analysis also showed that IRI
estimated this way depends on the pavement type and functional class. The paper
also includes an exploratory section that addresses the reverse situation, that
is, estimating the probability of pavement distress type distribution and
occurrence severity/extent based on a given roughness level.

potentials struggle with the long-range behaviour due to their inherent

treatment of the electrostatic potential such that the long-range and

we introduce an equivariant graph neural network (GNN) to address this issue.
The proposed model predicts atomic multipoles up to the quadrupole,
circumventing the need of expensive QM computations. By using an equivariant
architecture, the model enforces the correct symmetry by design without relying
on local reference frames. The GNN reproduces the electrostatic potential of
various systems with high fidelity. Possible use cases for such an approach
include the separate treatment of long-range interactions in ML potentials, the
analysis of electrostatic potential surfaces, and for the static multipoles in
polarizable force fields.

tasks since they both aim to predict a collection of nested and non-crossing

novel pointing mechanism for bottom-up parsing to tackle both tasks. The key
idea is based on the observation that if we traverse a constituency tree in
post-order, i.e., visiting a parent after its children, then two consecutively
visited spans would share a boundary. Our model tracks the shared boundaries
and predicts the next boundary at each step by leveraging a pointer network. As
a result, it needs only linear steps to parse and thus is efficient. It also
maintains a parsing configuration for structural consistency, i.e., always
outputting valid trees. Experimentally, our model achieves the state-of-the-art
performance on PTB among all BERT-based models (96.01 F1 score) and competitive
performance on CTB7 in constituency parsing; and it also achieves strong
performance on three benchmark datasets of nested NER: ACE2004, ACE2005, and

problems, similarly to the recently emerging class of Deep BSDE methods [Han et
al. (2018), Hur\'e et al. (2020)]. An error analysis is carried out to show

fully coupled with the FENE-P viscoelastic model and the equations governing

through a non-linear equation of state which relates the surface tension to the
surfactant concentration at the interface. The two-fluid Navier-Stokes
equations are solved using a front-tracking method, augmented with a very
efficient FFT-based pressure projection method that allows for massively
parallel simulations of turbulent flows. It is found that, for the
surfactant-free case, bubbles move toward the wall due to inertial lift force,
resulting in formation of wall layers and a significant decrease in the flow
rate. Conversely, a high-enough concentration of surfactant changes the
direction of lateral migration of bubbles, i.e., the contaminated bubbles move
toward the core region and spread out across the channel. When viscoelasticity
is considered, viscoelastic stresses counteract the Marangoni stresses,
promoting formation of bubbly wall-layers and consequently strong decrease in
the flow rate. The formation of bubble wall-layers for combined case depends on
the interplay of the inertial and elastic, and Marangoni forces.

stably stratified zones plays a significant role in stellar interior dynamics
as this process may lead to mixing of chemical species, and contribute to the
transport of angular momentum and magnetic fields. We present a series of fully
non-linear, three-dimensional (3D) anelastic simulations of overshooting
convection in a spherical shell which are focused on the dependence of the
overshooting dynamics on the density stratification and the rotation, both key
ingredients in stars which however have not been studied systematically
together via global simulations. We demonstrate that the overshoot lengthscale
is not simply a monotonic function of the density stratification in the
convective region but instead, it depends on the ratio of the density
stratifications in the two zones. Additionally, we find that the overshoot
lengthscale decreases with decreasing Rossby number Ro and scales as
Ro$^{0.23}$ while it also depends on latitude with higher Rossby cases leading
to a weaker latitudinal variation. We examine the mean flows arising due to
rotation and find that they extend beyond the base of the convection zone into
the stable region. Our findings may provide a better understanding of the
dynamical interaction between stellar convective and radiative regions, and
motivate future studies particularly related to the solar tachocline and the
implications of its overlapping with the overshoot region.

involves a considerable amount of manual labor by experts. In this paper, we
introduce Mesh Draping: a neural method for transferring existing mesh
structure from one shape to another. The method drapes the source mesh over the
target geometry and at the same time seeks to preserve the carefully designed
characteristics of the source mesh. At its core, our method deforms the source
mesh using progressive positional encoding. We show that by leveraging
gradually increasing frequencies to guide the neural optimization, we are able
to achieve stable and high quality mesh transfer. Our approach is simple and
requires little user guidance, compared to contemporary surface mapping
techniques which rely on parametrization or careful manual tuning. Most
importantly, Mesh Draping is a parameterization-free method, and thus
applicable to a variety of target shape representations, including point
clouds, polygon soups, and non-manifold meshes. We demonstrate that the
transferred meshing remains faithful to the source mesh design characteristics,
and at the same time fits the target geometry well.

galaxy clustering and its cross-correlation with shear for the photometric
sample of Euclid. Using updated specifications, we study the impact of lensing
magnification on the constraints and the shift in the estimation of the best
fitting cosmological parameters that we expect if this effect is neglected. We
follow the prescriptions of the official Euclid Fisher matrix forecast for the
photometric galaxy clustering analysis and the combination of photometric
clustering and cosmic shear. The slope of the luminosity function (local count
slope), which regulates the amplitude of the lensing magnification, and the
galaxy bias have been estimated from the Euclid Flagship simulation.We find
that magnification significantly affects both the best-fit estimation of
cosmological parameters and the constraints in the galaxy clustering analysis
of the photometric sample. In particular, including magnification in the
analysis reduces the 1$\sigma$ errors on $\Omega_{\text{m},0}, w_{0}, w_a$ at
the level of 20-35%, depending on how well we will be able to independently
measure the local count slope. In addition, we find that neglecting
magnification in the clustering analysis leads to shifts of up to 1.6$\sigma$
in the best-fit parameters. In the joint analysis of galaxy clustering, cosmic
shear, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, magnification does not improve precision, but
it leads to an up to 6$\sigma$ bias if neglected. Therefore, for all models
considered in this work, magnification has to be included in the analysis of
galaxy clustering and its cross-correlation with the shear signal ($3\times2$pt
analysis) for an accurate parameter estimation.

by either improving collectors' stack performance or by limiting the amount of

data into the collectors' memory, bypassing their CPU, and thereby improving
their collection scalability. We propose to use a method we call \emph{direct
telemetry access}, where switches jointly write telemetry reports directly into
the same collector's memory region, without coordination. Our solution, DART,
is probabilistic, trading memory redundancy and query success probability for
CPU resources at collectors. We prototype DART using commodity hardware such as
P4 switches and RDMA NICs and show that we get high query success rates with a
reasonable memory overhead. For example, we can collect INT path tracing
information on a fat tree topology without a collector's CPU involvement while
achieving 99.9\% query success probability and using just 300 bytes per flow.

the class of implicit planners inspired by value iteration, an algorithm that
is guaranteed to yield perfect policies in fully-specified tabular
environments. We find that prior approaches either assume that the environment
is provided in such a tabular form -- which is highly restrictive -- or infer
""local neighbourhoods"" of states to run value iteration over -- for which we
discover an algorithmic bottleneck effect. This effect is caused by explicitly
running the planning algorithm based on scalar predictions in every state,
which can be harmful to data efficiency if such scalars are improperly
predicted. We propose eXecuted Latent Value Iteration Networks (XLVINs), which
alleviate the above limitations. Our method performs all planning computations
in a high-dimensional latent space, breaking the algorithmic bottleneck. It
maintains alignment with value iteration by carefully leveraging neural
graph-algorithmic reasoning and contrastive self-supervised learning. Across
eight low-data settings -- including classical control, navigation and Atari --
XLVINs provide significant improvements to data efficiency against value
iteration-based implicit planners, as well as relevant model-free baselines.
Lastly, we empirically verify that XLVINs can closely align with value

contours. In the ST-VNet, a V-Net is employed to hierarchically extract spatial
features, and convolutional long-term short-term memory (ConvLSTM) units are
added to the skip-connection pathway to extract the temporal features. The
input of the ST-VNet is ECG-gated sequential frames of the MPS images and the
output is the probability map of the epicardial or endocardial masks. A Dice
similarity coefficient (DSC) loss which penalizes the discrepancy between the
model prediction and the ground truth was adopted to optimize the segmentation
model. Results. Our segmentation model was trained and validated on a
retrospective dataset with 45 subjects, and the cardiac cycle of each subject
was divided into 8 gates. The proposed ST-VNet achieved a DSC of 0.8914 and
0.8157 for the RV epicardium and endocardium segmentation, respectively. The

limits on the resolution of optical imaging. For over a century, the
Abbe-Rayleigh criterion has been utilized to assess the spatial resolution
limits of optical instruments. Recently, there has been an enormous impetus in
overcoming the Abbe-Rayleigh resolution limit by projecting target light beams
onto spatial modes. These conventional schemes for superresolution rely on a
series of spatial projective measurements to pick up phase information that is
used to boost the spatial resolution of optical systems. Unfortunately, these
schemes require a priori information regarding the coherence properties of
""unknown"" light beams. Furthermore, they require stringent alignment and
centering conditions that cannot be achieved in realistic scenarios. Here, we
introduce a smart quantum camera for superresolving imaging. This camera
exploits the self-learning features of artificial intelligence to identify the
statistical fluctuations of unknown mixtures of light sources at each pixel.
This is achieved through a universal quantum model that enables the design of
artificial neural networks for the identification of quantum photon
fluctuations. Our camera overcomes the inherent limitations of existing
superresolution schemes based on spatial mode projection. Thus, our work
provides a new perspective in the field of imaging with important implications
for microscopy, remote sensing, and astronomy.

translation systems from generatively pre-trained language models. Our method
consists of three steps: few-shot amplification, distillation, and
backtranslation. We first use the zero-shot translation ability of large
pre-trained language models to generate translations for a small set of
unlabeled sentences. We then amplify these zero-shot translations by using them
as few-shot demonstrations for sampling a larger synthetic dataset. This
dataset is distilled by discarding the few-shot demonstrations and then
fine-tuning. During backtranslation, we repeatedly generate translations for a
set of inputs and then fine-tune a single language model on both directions of
the translation task at once, ensuring cycle-consistency by swapping the roles
of gold monotext and generated translations when fine-tuning. By using our
method to leverage GPT-3's zero-shot translation capability, we achieve a new
state-of-the-art in unsupervised translation on the WMT14 English-French
benchmark, attaining a BLEU score of 42.1.

$^{247}$Cm as well as the corresponding reference isotopes $^{127}$I and
$^{235}$U at the Solar location. We consider up to three different sources that
have distinct $^{129}$I/$^{247}$Cm production ratios corresponding to the
varied $r$-process conditions in different astrophysical scenarios. In contrast
to the results found by C\^ot\'e et al. (2021), we find that $^{129}$I and
$^{247}$Cm in the ESS do not come entirely from a single major event but get
contributions from at least two more minor contributors. This has a dramatic
effect on the evolution of the $^{129}$I/$^{247}$Cm ratio, such that the
measured ESS value in meteorites may not correspond to that of the ""$last$""
major $r$-process event. Interestingly, however, we find that the
$^{129}$I/$^{247}$Cm ratio, in combination with the observed
$^{129}$I/$^{127}$I and $^{247}$Cm/$^{235}$U ratio in the ESS, can still
provide important constraints on the properties of proposed $r$-process sources

production is presented using 139 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of data collected by the
ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during $pp$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The observable measures the different probability of top and
antitop quarks to have the higher energy as a function of the jet scattering
angle with respect to the beam axis. The energy asymmetry is measured in the
semileptonic $t\bar{t}$ decay channel, and the hadronically decaying top quark
must have transverse momentum above $350$ GeV. The results are corrected for
detector effects to particle level in three bins of the scattering angle of the
associated jet. The measurement agrees with the SM prediction at
next-to-leading-order accuracy in quantum chromodynamics in all three bins. In
the bin with the largest expected asymmetry, where the jet is emitted
perpendicular to the beam, the energy asymmetry is measured to be
$-0.043\pm0.020$, in agreement with the SM prediction of $-0.037\pm0.003$.
Interpreting this result in the framework of the Standard Model effective field
theory (SMEFT), it is shown that the energy asymmetry is sensitive to the
top-quark chirality in four-quark operators and is therefore a valuable new
observable in global SMEFT fits.

challenging environments, but designing controllers that are sufficiently
robust to handle this diversity has been a long-standing challenge in robotics.
Reinforcement learning presents an appealing approach for automating the
controller design process and has been able to produce remarkably robust
controllers when trained in a suitable range of environments. However, it is
difficult to predict all likely conditions the robot will encounter during
deployment and enumerate them at training-time. What if instead of training
controllers that are robust enough to handle any eventuality, we enable the
robot to continually learn in any setting it finds itself in? This kind of
real-world reinforcement learning poses a number of challenges, including
efficiency, safety, and autonomy. To address these challenges, we propose a
practical robot reinforcement learning system for fine-tuning locomotion
policies in the real world. We demonstrate that a modest amount of real-world
training can substantially improve performance during deployment, and this
enables a real A1 quadrupedal robot to autonomously fine-tune multiple
locomotion skills in a range of environments, including an outdoor lawn and a
variety of indoor terrains.

highly ambiguous task. Most existing approaches require paired training images;
i.e. images of the same person with the same clothing in different poses.
However, obtaining sufficiently large datasets with paired data is challenging
and costly. Previous methods that forego paired supervision lack realism. We
propose a self-supervised framework named SPICE (Self-supervised Person Image
CrEation) that closes the image quality gap with supervised methods. The key
insight enabling self-supervision is to exploit 3D information about the human
body in several ways. First, the 3D body shape must remain unchanged when
reposing. Second, representing body pose in 3D enables reasoning about self
occlusions. Third, 3D body parts that are visible before and after reposing,
should have similar appearance features. Once trained, SPICE takes an image of
a person and generates a new image of that person in a new target pose. SPICE
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DeepFashion dataset, improving the
FID score from 29.9 to 7.8 compared with previous unsupervised methods, and
with performance similar to the state-of-the-art supervised method (6.4). SPICE
also generates temporally coherent videos given an input image and a sequence

maghemite, identical dynamics is observed. It arises from the THz interfacial
spin Seebeck effect (SSE), is fully determined by the relaxation of the
electrons in the metal layer and provides an estimate of the spin-mixing
conductance of the GIG/Pt interface. Remarkably, in the half-metallic
ferrimagnet Fe3O4 (magnetite), our measurements reveal two spin-current
components with opposite direction. The slower, positive component exhibits SSE
dynamics and is assigned to torque-type magnon excitation of the A- and B-spin
sublattices of Fe3O4. The faster, negative component arises from the
pyro-spintronic effect and can consistently be assigned to ultrafast
demagnetization of e-sublattice minority-spin hopping electrons. This
observation supports the magneto-electronic model of Fe3O4. In general, our
results provide a new route to the contact-free separation of torque- and

possible to infer information about such an environment based on a single
measurement of the qubit coherence, circumventing any need for separate
spectroscopy experiments. Similarly to other spectroscopic techniques, the
qubit is used as a probe which interacts with its environment. The complexity
of the relationship between the observed qubit dynamics and the impurities in
the environment makes this problem ideal for machine learning methods - more
specifically neural networks. With our algorithm we are able to reconstruct the

differentiate between different environment models, paving the way towards a

splitted into purely energy and quasimomentum dependent terms, however singular

pixel positions and their diffracted intensity as weights in the minimisation.
We compare this method to the more popular cake integration method, and show
that the weighted ellipse method works when the cake integration method fails

isolate the precise error in Hawking's argument. A similar assumption also
underpins the monogamy paradox of Mathur and AMPS. Finally the same assumption
is used to support the common idea that the entanglement entropy of the region
outside a black hole should follow a Page curve. It is for this reason that
computations of the Page curve have been performed only in nonstandard theories
of gravity, which include a nongravitational bath and massive gravitons. The
fine-grained entropy at ${\cal I}^{+}$ does not obey a Page curve for an

vector-like quark singlets breaks the unitarity of the

neutral (FCN) vertices. The resulting radiative flavour changing decays of
these particles through the electromagnetic transition dipole moment are a key

Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Despite these radiative decays providing such a
clean experimental signature, an explicit analytical study of the branching

far evaded attention. We provide the formulation for the decay rates and $CP$

that the predictions or pseudo labels of these categories could be too

balances the training of well and badly performed categories, with a confidence
bank to dynamically track category-wise performance during training. The
confidence bank is leveraged as an indicator to tilt training towards
under-performing categories, instantiated in three strategies: 1) adaptive
Copy-Paste and CutMix data augmentation approaches which give more chance for
under-performing categories to be copied or cut; 2) an adaptive data sampling
approach to encourage pixels from under-performing category to be sampled; 3) a
simple yet effective re-weighting method to alleviate the training noise raised
by pseudo-labeling. Experimentally, AEL outperforms the state-of-the-art

compare to the confining pressure of their host environment ($P_\mathrm{de}$).
The HII regions remain unresolved within our ${\sim}50{-}100$ pc resolution
observations, so we place upper ($P_\mathrm{max}$) and lower ($P_\mathrm{min}$)
limits on each of the pressures by using a minimum (i.e. clumpy structure) and
maximum (i.e. smooth structure) size, respectively. We find that the
$P_\mathrm{max}$ measurements are broadly similar, and for $P_\mathrm{min}$ the
$P_\mathrm{therm}$ is mildly dominant. We find that the majority of HII regions
are over-pressured, $P_\mathrm{tot}/P_\mathrm{de} =
(P_\mathrm{therm}+P_\mathrm{wind}+P_\mathrm{rad})/P_\mathrm{de} > 1$, and
expanding, yet there is a small sample of compact HII regions with
$P_\mathrm{tot,max}/P_\mathrm{de} < 1$ ($\sim$1% of the sample). These mostly
reside in galaxy centres ($R_\mathrm{gal}<1$kpc), or, specifically,
environments of high gas surface density;
log($\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}/\mathrm{M_\odot} \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$)$\sim$2.5 (measured
on kpc-scales). Lastly, we compare to a sample of literature measurements for
$P_\mathrm{therm}$ and $P_\mathrm{rad}$ to investigate how dominant pressure
term transitions over around 5dex in spatial dynamic range and 10 dex in
pressure.

include new prescriptions in \texttt{CMC} for the formation of binaries through
giant star collisions and tidal captures, and we show that these mechanisms
play a crucial role in the formation of neutron star binaries and millisecond
pulsars in 47~Tuc; our best-fit model contains $\sim 50$ millisecond pulsars,
$70\%$ of which are formed through giant collisions and tidal captures. Our

is a key element in modelling the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD), which
itself is a powerful tool to connect observational studies with numerical

abundance both in cosmological simulations and in mock observations. Methods:
We build an emulator (HODEmu, \url{https://github.com/aragagnin/HODEmu/}) of
satellite abundance based on cosmological parameters $\Omega_m, \Omega_b,
\sigma_8, h_0$ and redshift $z.$ We train our emulator using \magneticum
hydrodynamic simulations that span 15 different cosmologies, each over $4$
redshift slices between $0<z<0.5,$ and for each setup we fit normalisation $A$,
log-slope $\beta$ and Gaussian fractional-scatter $\sigma$ of the $N_s-M$

Regression (GPR). Results: We find that $A$ and $\beta$ depend on cosmological
parameters, even if weakly, especially on $\Omega_m,$ $\Omega_b.$ This
dependency can explain some discrepancies found in literature between satellite
HOD of different cosmological simulations (Magneticum, Illustris, BAHAMAS). We
also show that satellite abundance cosmology dependency differs between
full-physics (FP) simulations, dark-matter only (DMO), and non-radiative
simulations. Conclusions: This work provides a preliminary calibration of the
cosmological dependency of the satellite abundance of high mass halos, and we
showed that modelling HOD with cosmological parameters is necessary to
interpret satellite abundance, and we showed the importance of using FP
simulations in modelling this dependency.

the merger history of dwarf-mass galaxies (with M_halo~10^10 M_Sun). Our input
galaxy models describe the stellar mass-halo mass relation, and the galaxy
occupation fraction. The number of major and minor mergers depends on the type
of dark matter; in particular, minor mergers are greatly suppressed in warm
dark matter models. In addition, the number of mergers that bring in stars is
strongly dependent on the galaxy occupation model. For example, minor mergers
are negligible for stellar halo growth in models with a high mass threshold for
galaxy formation (i.e. 10^9.3 M_Sun at z=0). Moreover, this threshold for
galaxy formation can also determine the relative difference (if any) between
the stellar haloes of satellite and field dwarfs. Using isolated simulations of
dwarf-dwarf mergers, we show that the relative frequency of major and minor
mergers predict very different stellar haloes: Typically, ""intermediate"" dark
matter merger ratios (~1:5) maximise the growth of distant stellar haloes. We
discuss the observability of dwarf stellar haloes and find that the surface
brightness of these features are incredibly faint. However, when several dwarfs
are stacked together models that form particularly rich stellar haloes could be
detectable. Finally, we show that stellar streams in the Galactic halo
overlapping in phase-space with known dwarf satellites are likely remnants of
their stripped stellar haloes. The mere existence of dwarf stellar haloes can
already put constraints on some small-scale models, and thus observational
probes should be a high priority.

strongly lensed quasars and to constrain parameters of the stellar mass
function of lens galaxies. This is done by analysing microlensing light curves
between the multiple images of strongly lensed quasars, under the influence of
three main variable components: 1- the continuum flux of the source, 2-
microlensing by stars in the lens galaxy and 3- reverberation of the continuum
by the Broad Line Region (BLR). The latter, ignored by state-of-the-art
microlensing techniques, can introduce high-frequency variations which we show
carry information on the BLR size. We present a new method which includes all
these components simultaneously and fits the power spectrum of the data in the
Fourier space, rather than the observed light curve itself. In this new
framework, we analyse COSMOGRAIL light curves of the two-image system
QJ0158-4325 known to display high-frequency variations. Using exclusively the
low frequency part of the power spectrum our constraint on the accretion disk
radius agrees with the thin disk model estimate and previous work that fit the
microlensing light curves in real space. However, if we also take into account
the high-frequency variations, the data favour significantly smaller disk sizes
than previous microlensing measurements. In this case, our results are in
agreement with the thin disk model prediction only if we assume very low mean
masses for the microlens population, i.e. <M> = 0.01 $M_\odot$. Eventually,
including the differentially microlensed continuum reverberation by the BLR
successfully explains the high frequencies without requiring such low mass
microlenses. This allows us to measure, for the first time, the size of the BLR
using single-band photometric monitoring, $R_{BLR}$ = $1.6^{+1.5}_{-0.8}\times
10^{17}$cm, in agreement with estimates using the BLR size-luminosity relation.

the radii of discs of bound protostellar systems tend to decrease with
decreasing metallicity, with the median characteristic radius of discs in the

tend to decrease with decreasing metallicity. We find that the circumstellar
discs and orbits of bound protostellar pairs, and the two spins of the two
protostars are all less well aligned with each other with lower metallicity
than with higher metallicity. These variations with metallicity are due to
increased small scale fragmentation due to lower opacities and greater cooling
rates with lower metallicity, which increase the stellar multiplicity and
increase dynamical interactions. We compare the disc masses and radii of
protostellar systems from the solar metallicity calculation with recent surveys
of discs around Class 0 and I objects in the Orion and Perseus star-forming

four-dimensional perspective, the modular parameter is the axion-dilaton, and
our results show that $S$-duality leaves this subset of the spectrum invariant.
From the five-dimensional perspective, the modular parameter is the complex

the dimensional reduction of the M5-brane worldvolume theory to $T^2$. As a
case study, we specialize the compactification manifold to a K3 fibration, and

players in gravitational-wave astronomy. The underlying assumptions are that
the targeted source parameters refer to the same quantities for all events in
the catalog and are included when modeling selection effects. Both these points
have so far been neglected when estimating the orientations of the black-hole
spins. In particular, the detector-frame gravitational-wave frequency used to
define frequency-dependent quantities (e.g., 20 Hz) introduces an inconsistent
reference between events at the population level. We solve both issues by
modeling binary black-hole populations and selection effects at past time
infinity, corresponding to the well-defined reference frequency of 0 Hz. We
show that, while current gravitational-wave measurement uncertainties obfuscate
the influence of reference frequency in population inference, ignoring spins

surrounding a nascent star cluster, and for this reason have been considered
candidates for regulating star formation. However, direct observations suggest
most wind power is lost, and Lancaster21a,b recently proposed that this is due
to efficient mixing and cooling processes. Here, we simulate star formation
with wind feedback in turbulent, self-gravitating clouds, extending our
previous work. Our simulations cover clouds with initial surface density
$10^2-10^4$ $M_{\odot} \, {\rm pc}^{-2}$, and show that star formation and
residual gas dispersal is complete within 2 - 8 initial cloud free-fall times.
The ""Efficiently Cooled"" model for stellar wind bubble evolution predicts
enough energy is lost for the bubbles to become momentum-driven, we find this
is satisfied in our simulations. We also find that wind energy losses from
turbulent, radiative mixing layers dominate losses by ""cloud leakage"" over the
timescales relevant for star formation. We show that the net star formation
efficiency (SFE) in our simulations can be explained by theories that apply
wind momentum to disperse cloud gas, allowing for highly inhomogeneous internal
cloud structure. For very dense clouds, the SFE is similar to those observed in
extreme star-forming environments. Finally, we find that, while self-pollution
by wind material is insignificant in cloud conditions with moderate density
(only $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ of the stellar mass originated in winds), our
simulations with conditions more typical of a super star cluster have star
particles that form with as much as 1\% of their mass in wind material.

In these models, while the inflationary trajectories are stable, one Hessian
eigenvalue is always tachyonic and large, in Hubble units. Thus, these models
satisfy the de Sitter swampland conjecture along the inflationary trajectory.
However, the high curvatures underscore the difficulty of obtaining rapid-turn

$\eta$-problem in multifield slow-roll inflation and show that it does not

namely, that the output distributions of super-logarithmic depth Clifford
circuits are not sample-efficiently learnable in the statistical query model,
i.e., when given query access to empirical expectation values of bounded

includes the Clifford group. As many practical generative modelling algorithms
use statistical queries -- including those for training quantum circuit Born
machines -- our result is broadly applicable and strongly limits the
possibility of a meaningful quantum advantage for learning the output
distributions of local quantum circuits. As a positive result, we show that in
a more powerful oracle model, namely when directly given access to samples, the
output distributions of local Clifford circuits are computationally efficiently
PAC learnable by a classical learner. Our results are equally applicable to the
problems of learning an algorithm for generating samples from the target

Similarly, wind-forced waves on a flat-bottom likewise experience growth/decay
and changes to wave shape. However, the combined effect of shoaling and
wind-forcing on wave shape, particularly relevant in the near-shore
environment, has not yet been investigated theoretically. Here, we consider
small-amplitude, shallow-water solitary waves propagating up a gentle, planar
bathymetry forced by a weak, Jeffreys-type wind-induced surface pressure. We
derive a variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (vKdV-B) equation
governing the wave profile's evolution and solve it numerically using a
Runge-Kutta third-order finite difference solver. The simulations run until
convective prebreaking -- a Froude number limit appropriate to the order of the
vKdV-B equation. Offshore winds weakly enhance the ratio of prebreaking height
to depth as well as prebreaking wave slope. Onshore winds have a strong impact
on narrowing the wave peak, and wind also modulates the rear shelf formed
behind the wave. Furthermore, wind strongly affects the width of the
prebreaking zone, with larger effects for smaller beach slopes. After
converting our pressure magnitudes to physically realistic wind speeds, we
observe qualitative agreement with prior laboratory and numerical experiments
on breakpoint location. Additionally, our numerical results have qualitatively
similar temporal wave shape to shoaling and wind-forced laboratory
observations, suggesting that the vKdV-B equation captures the essential
aspects of wind-induced effects on shoaling wave shape. Finally, we isolate the
wind's effect by comparing the wave profiles to the unforced case. This reveals
that the numerical results are approximately a superposition of a solitary
wave, a shoaling-induced shelf, and a wind-induced, bound, dispersive, and

presents a data-driven control synthesis framework for such systems subject to
linear temporal logic on finite traces (LTLf) specifications. The framework
combines a baseline (offline) controller with a novel online controller and
refinement procedure that improves the baseline guarantees as new data is
collected. The baseline controller is computed offline on an uncertain
abstraction constructed using Gaussian process (GP) regression on a given
dataset. The offline controller provides a lower bound on the probability of
satisfying the LTLf specification, which may be far from optimal due to both
discretization and regression errors. The synergy arises from the online
controller using the offline abstraction along with the current state and new
data to choose the next best action. The online controller may improve the
baseline guarantees since it avoids the discretization error and reduces
regression error as new data is collected. The new data are also used to refine
the abstraction and offline controller using local GP regression, which
significantly reduces the computation overhead. Evaluations show the efficacy
of the proposed offline-online framework, especially when compared against the
offline controller.

a key problem in linear algebra, signal processing, data analysis and machine

algorithms have been developed under the assumption that there is at least one
nearby data point to each vertex; two of the most widely used ones are vertex
component analysis (VCA) and the successive projection algorithm (SPA). This
assumption is known as the pure-pixel assumption in blind hyperspectral
unmixing, and as the separability assumption in nonnegative matrix
factorization. More recently, Bhattacharyya and Kannan (ACM-SIAM Symposium on

inspired by ALLS, we propose smoothed VCA (SVCA) and smoothed SPA (SSPA) that
generalize VCA and SPA by assuming the presence of several nearby data points

on feature extraction on facial images data sets. In addition, our study
highlights new theoretical results for VCA.

contemporary data-intensive industries have seen a sharp upsurge in the
resource requirements of modern applications. This has led to the provisioning
of an increased number of cloud servers, giving rise to higher energy
consumption and, consequently, sustainability concerns. Traditional heuristics
and reinforcement learning based algorithms for energy-efficient cloud resource
management address the scalability and adaptability related challenges to a
limited extent. Existing work often fails to capture dependencies across
thermal characteristics of hosts, resource consumption of tasks and the
corresponding scheduling decisions. This leads to poor scalability and an
increase in the compute resource requirements, particularly in environments

an artificial intelligence (AI) based holistic resource management technique

the goal of optimizing energy efficiency in data centers as a multi-objective
scheduling problem, considering three important models: energy, thermal and
cooling. HUNTER utilizes a Gated Graph Convolution Network as a surrogate model
for approximating the Quality of Service (QoS) for a system state and
generating optimal scheduling decisions. Experiments on simulated and physical

HUNTER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of energy consumption,

is effective in mitigating urban traffic congestion and thereby improve urban
travel efficiency. It has been suggested that dynamic rerouting could be
facilitated using emerging technologies such as fog-computing which offer
advantages of low-latency capabilities and information exchange between
vehicles and roadway infrastructure. To address this question, this study
proposes a two-stage model that combines GAQ (Graph Attention Network - Deep Q
Learning) and EBkSP (Entropy Based k Shortest Path) using a fog-cloud
architecture, to reroute vehicles in a dynamic urban environment and therefore
to improve travel efficiency in terms of travel speed. First, GAQ analyzes the
traffic conditions on each road and for each fog area, and then assigns a road
index based on the information attention from both local and neighboring areas.
Second, EBkSP assigns the route for each vehicle based on the vehicle priority
and route popularity. A case study experiment is carried out to investigate the
efficacy of the proposed model. At the model training stage, different methods
are used to establish the vehicle priorities, and their impact on the results
is assessed. Also, the proposed model is tested under various scenarios with
different ratios of rerouting and background (non-rerouting) vehicles. The
results demonstrate that vehicle rerouting using the proposed model can help
attain higher speed and reduces possibility of severe congestion. This result
suggests that the proposed model can be deployed by urban transportation
agencies for dynamic rerouting and ultimately, to reduce urban traffic
congestion.

co-orbital gaseous component detectable via emission from atomic transitions -
usually the 8600 Angstrom CaII triplet. These emission profiles can be highly
variable in both morphology and strength. Furthermore, the morphological
variations in a few systems have been shown to be periodic, likely produced by
an apsidally precessing asymmetric disc. Of the known gaseous debris discs,
that around HE1349-2305 has the most rapidly evolving emission line morphology,
and we present updated spectroscopy of the CaII triplet of this system. The
additional observations show that the emission line morphologies vary
periodically and consistently, and we constrain the period to two aliases of
459$\pm$3d and 502$\pm$3d. We produce images of the CaII triplet emission from
the disc in velocity space using Doppler tomography - only the second such
imaging of a white dwarf debris disc. We suggest that the asymmetric nature of
these velocity images is generated by gas moving on eccentric orbits with
radially-dependent excitation conditions via photo-ionisation from the white
dwarf. We also obtained short-cadence (~ 4 min) spectroscopy to search for
variability on the time-scale of the disc's orbital period (~ hours) due to the
presence of a planetesimal, and rule out variability at a level of ~ 1.4 per

been developed in recent years; these enable researchers to plan SMARTs for

Existing resources for estimating sample size requirements for SMARTs with

paper addresses this issue by providing sample size simulation code and
approximate formulas for two-wave repeated measures binary outcomes (i.e., two

discuss how to use simulations to calculate power for studies with more than

superfluid. Building on the principles of Unified Extended Irreversible
Thermodynamics, the model is derived from Carter's multifluid approach for a
theory with 3 four-currents: particles, entropy, and quasi-particles.
Dissipation arises directly from the fact that the quasi-particle four-current
is an independent degree of freedom that does not necessarily comove with the
entropy. For small deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium, the model
provides an extension of the Israel-Stewart theory to superfluid systems. It
can, therefore, be made hyperbolic, causal and stable if the microscopic input
is accurate. The non-dissipative limit of the model is the relativistic
two-fluid model of Carter, Khalatnikov and Gusakov. The Newtonian limit of the
model is an Extended-Irreversible-Thermodynamic extension of Landau's two-fluid
model. The model predicts the existence of four bulk viscosity coefficients and
accounts for their microscopic origin, providing their exact formulas in terms
of the quasi-particle creation rate. Furthermore, when fast oscillations of
small amplitude around the equilibrium are considered, the relaxation-time term
in the telegraph-type equations for the bulk viscosities accounts directly for
their expected dependence on the frequency.

the Brinkman equations. Analytical solutions to these equations are limited to
standard geometries. Finite volume or element schemes can be used in more
complicated geometries, but become cumbersome when there are moving boundaries
that require frequent remeshing of the domain. In Newtonian fluids, the method
of regularized Stokeselets has gained popularity due to its ease of
implementation, including for moving boundaries, especially for swimming and
pumping problems. While the corresponding method of regularized Brinkmanlets
can be used in a domain consisting entirely of Brinkman medium, many
applications would benefit from an easily implemented representation of flow in
a domain with heterogeneous regions of Brinkman medium and Newtonian fluid. In
this paper, we model flows in porous media by scattering many static
regularized Stokeslets randomly in three dimensions to emulate the forces
exerted by the rigid porous structure. We perform numerical experiments to
deduce the correspondence between the chosen density and blob size of
regularized Stokeslets in our model, and a Brinkman medium.

traverse across the sky due to the combined effects of proper motion and
parallax. It is well known that the gravitational pull of an unseen companion
can cause deviations to these tracks. Several studies have pointed out that the
astrometric mission Gaia will be able to identify a slew of new exoplanets,
stellar binaries, and compact object companions with orbital periods as short
as tens of days to as long as Gaia's lifetime. Here, we use mock astrometric
observations to demonstrate that Gaia can identify and characterize black hole
companions to luminous stars with orbital periods longer than Gaia's lifetime.
Such astrometric binaries have orbital periods too long to exhibit complete
orbits, and instead are identified through curvature in their characteristic
helical paths. By simultaneously measuring the radius of this curvature and the
orbital velocity, constraints can be placed on the underlying orbit. We
quantify the precision with which Gaia can measure orbital accelerations and
apply that to model predictions for the population of black holes orbiting
stars in the stellar neighborhood. Although orbital degeneracies imply that
many of the accelerations induced by hidden black holes could also be explained
by faint low-mass stars, we discuss how the nature of certain putative black
hole companions can be confirmed with high confidence using Gaia data alone.

secular spin-orbit resonance, recent works show that Saturn's obliquity could
be steadily increasing today and may reach large values in the next billions of
years. Satellites around high-obliquity planets are known to be unstable near
their Laplace radius, but the approximations used so far are invalidated in
this regime.
  Aims: We aim to investigate the behaviour of a planet and its satellite when
the satellite crosses its Laplace radius while the planet is locked in secular
spin-orbit resonance.
  Methods: We expand on previous works and revisit the concept of Laplace
surface. We use it to build an averaged analytical model that couples the
planetary spin-axis and satellite dynamics.
  Results: We show that the dynamics is organised around a critical point, S1,
at which the phase-space structure is singular, located at 90{\deg} obliquity
and near the Laplace radius. If the spin-axis precession rate of the planet is
maintained fixed by a resonance while the satellite migrates outwards or
inwards, then S1 acts as an attractor towards which the system is forced to
evolve. When it reaches the vicinity of S1, the entire system breaks down,
either because the planet is expelled from the resonance or because the
satellite is ejected or collides into the planet.
  Conclusions: Provided that Titan's migration is not halted in the future,
Titan and Saturn may reach instability between a few gigayears and several tens
of gigayears from now, depending on Titan's migration rate. The evolution would
destabilise Titan and drive Saturn towards an obliquity of 90{\deg}. Our
findings may have important consequences for Uranus. They also provide a
straightforward mechanism for producing transiting exoplanets with a face-on
massive ring, a configuration that is often put forward to explain some
super-puff exoplanets.

human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected human-driven vehicles (CHDVs). In
recognition of the fact that public acceptance of CAVs will hinge on safety
performance of automated driving systems, and that there will likely be safety
challenges in the early part of the transition period, significant research
efforts have been expended in the development of safety-conscious automated
driving systems. Yet still, there appears to be a lacuna in the literature
regarding the handling of the crash-imminent situations that are caused by
errant human driven vehicles (HDVs) in the vicinity of the CAV during
operations on the roadway. In this paper, we develop a simple model-based
Reinforcement Learning (RL) based system that can be deployed in the CAV to
generate trajectories that anticipate and avoid potential collisions caused by
drivers of the HDVs. The model involves an end-to-end data-driven approach that
contains a motion prediction model based on deep learning, and a fast
trajectory planning algorithm based on model predictive control (MPC). The
proposed system requires no prior knowledge or assumption about the physical
environment including the vehicle dynamics, and therefore represents a general
approach that can be deployed on any type of vehicle (e.g., truck, buse,
motorcycle, etc.). The framework is trained and tested in the CARLA simulator
with multiple collision imminent scenarios, and the results indicate the
proposed model can avoid the collision at high successful rate (>85%) even in
highly compact and dangerous situations.

  Optical Fiber Nonlinearity Compensation",,,"10.1109/JLT.2021.3133475",,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Derived from the regular perturbation treatment of the nonlinear Schrodinger
equation, a machine learning-based scheme to mitigate the intra-channel optical
fiber nonlinearity is proposed. Referred to as the perturbation theory-aided
(PA) learned digital back-propagation (LDBP), the proposed scheme constructs a
deep neural network (DNN) in a way similar to the split-step Fourier method:
linear and nonlinear operations alternate. Inspired by the perturbation
analysis, the intra-channel cross-phase modulation term is conveniently
represented by matrix operations in the DNN. The introduction of this term in
each nonlinear operation considerably improves the performance, as well as
enables the flexibility of PA-LDBP by adjusting the numbers of spans per step.
The proposed scheme is evaluated by numerical simulations of a single carrier
optical fiber communication system operating at 32 Gbaud with 64-quadrature
amplitude modulation and 20*80 km transmission distance. The results show that
the proposed scheme achieves approximately 3.5 dB, 1.8 dB, 1.4 dB, and 0.5 dB
performance gain in terms of Q2 factor over the linear compensation, when the
numbers of spans per step are 1, 2, 4, and 10, respectively. Two methods are
proposed to reduce the complexity of PALDBP, i.e., pruning the number of
perturbation coefficients and chromatic dispersion compensation in the
frequency domain for multi-span per step cases. Investigation of the
performance and complexity suggests that PA-LDBP attains improved performance
gains with reduced complexity when compared to LDBP in the cases of 4 and 10
spans per step.

  Reinforcement Learning","Under review for presentation at TRB 2022 Annual Meeting",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimizing traffic signal control (TSC) at intersections continues to pose a
challenging problem, particularly for large-scale traffic networks. It has been
shown in past research that it is feasible to optimize the operations of
individual TSC systems or a small number of such systems. However, it has been
computationally difficult to scale these solution approaches to large networks
partly due to the curse of dimensionality that is encountered as the number of
intersections increases. Fortunately, recent studies have recognized the
potential of exploiting advancements in deep and reinforcement learning to
address this problem, and some preliminary successes have been achieved in this
regard. However, facilitating such intelligent solution approaches may require
large amounts of infrastructural investments such as roadside units (RSUs) and
drones in order to ensure thorough connectivity across all intersections in
large networks, an investment that may be burdensome for agencies to undertake.
As such, this study builds on recent work to present a scalable TSC model that
may reduce the number of required enabling infrastructure. This is achieved
using graph attention networks (GATs) to serve as the neural network for deep
reinforcement learning, which aids in maintaining the graph topology of the
traffic network while disregarding any irrelevant or unnecessary information. A
case study is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model, and the results show much promise. The overall research outcome suggests
that by decomposing large networks using fog-nodes, the proposed fog-based
graphic RL (FG-RL) model can be easily applied to scale into larger traffic
networks.

delocalized and exhibit a temperature-dependent momentum distribution, lack a
thorough treatment. Here, we analyze the emission properties of excitons in
TMDCs near planar metal interfaces and explore their dependence on exciton
center-of-mass momentum, transition dipole orientation, and temperature.
Defining a characteristic energy scale $k_B T_c = (\hbar k)^2/2m$~($k$ being
the radiative wavevector and $m$ the exciton mass), we find that at
temperatures $T\gg T_c$ and low densities where the momentum distribution can
be characterized by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, the modified emission
rates~(normalized to free space) behave similarly to point dipoles at
temperatures $T\gg T_c$. This similarity in behavior arises due to the broad
nature of wavevector components making up the exciton and point dipole
emission. On the other hand, the narrow momentum distribution of excitons for
$T<T_c$ can result in significantly different emission behavior as compared to
point dipoles. These differences can be further amplified by considering
excitons with a Bose Einstein distribution at high phase space densities. We
find suppression or enhancement of emission relative to the point dipole case
by several orders of magnitude. These insights can help optimize the
performance of optoelectronic devices that incorporate 2D semiconductors near
metal electrodes and can inform future studies of exciton radiative dynamics at

the model to a lower dimension, and, in doing so, relieves the model of
incidental parameters in the cross-section. The central result of this paper
demonstrates that transforming the model and then applying the principal

consistent estimates of regression slope coefficients with $T$ fixed. Moreover,
these estimates are shown to be asymptotically unbiased in the presence of

without averaging in homogeneous directions. It is demonstrated that the
widely-used dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) has a singular dynamic model
constant if it is used without averaging. The singularity can cause exceedingly
large local values of the dynamic model constant. If these large values are not
mitigated by application of averaging, they can amplify discretization errors
and impair the stability of simulations. To improve the local applicability of
the DSM, the singularity is removed by replacing the resolved rate-of-strain
tensors in the Smagorinsky model with the resolved velocity gradient tensor.
These replacements result in the new dynamic gradient Smagorinsky model (DGSM).
Results of simulations of three canonical turbulent flows (decaying homogeneous
isotropic turbulence, a temporal mixing layer, and turbulent channel flow) are
presented to demonstrate the potential of this model. The DGSM provides
improved stability compared to the local DSM, and does not require averaging
for stability at time step sizes that are typically used for a static locally
consistent LES model. Results obtained with the DGSM are generally as accurate
as results obtained with the DSM, while the DGSM has lower computational
complexity. Moreover, the DGSM is easy to implement and does not require any
homogeneous direction in space or time. It is thus anticipated that the model
has a high potential for the simulation of complex flows.

previous multi-staged framework to MVPS, where the position, iso-depth
contours, or orientation measurements are estimated independently and then
fused later, our method is simple to implement and realize. Our method performs
neural rendering of multi-view images while utilizing surface normals estimated
by a deep photometric stereo network. We render the MVPS images by considering
the object's surface normals for each 3D sample point along the viewing
direction rather than explicitly using the density gradient in the volume space

questions about how social media platforms might be further fracturing an
already-divided public sphere. As opposed to ideological polarization,
affective polarization is defined less by divergent policy preferences and more
by strong negative emotions towards opposing political groups, and thus
arguably poses a formidable threat to rational democratic discourse. We explore
if prompting perspective-taking on social media platforms can help enhance
empathy between opposing groups as a first step towards reducing affective
polarization. Specifically, we deploy a randomized field experiment through a
browser extension to 1,611 participants on Twitter, which enables participants
to randomly replace their feeds with those belonging to accounts whose
political views either agree with or diverge from their own. We find that
simply exposing participants to ""outgroup"" feeds enhances engagement, but not
an understanding of why others hold their political views. On the other hand,
framing the experience in familiar, empathic terms by prompting participants to
recall a disagreement with a friend does not affect engagement, but does
increase their ability to understand opposing views. Our findings illustrate
how social media platforms might take simple steps that align with business
objectives to reduce affective polarization.

class of coordinated actor-critic algorithms (CAC) in which individually
parametrized policies have a {\it shared} part (which is jointly optimized

classification tasks. Although typical GCN models focus on classifying nodes
within a static graph, several recent variants propose node classification in
dynamic graphs whose topologies and node attributes change over time, e.g.,
social networks with dynamic relationships, or literature citation networks
with changing co-authorships. These works, however, do not fully address the
challenge of flexibly assigning different importance to snapshots of the graph
at different times, which depending on the graph dynamics may have more or less
predictive power on the labels. We address this challenge by proposing a new
method, GCN-SE, that attaches a set of learnable attention weights to graph
snapshots at different times, inspired by Squeeze and Excitation Net (SE-Net).
We show that GCN-SE outperforms previously proposed node classification methods
on a variety of graph datasets. To verify the effectiveness of the attention
weight in determining the importance of different graph snapshots, we adapt
perturbation-based methods from the field of explainable machine learning to

balance. Caster wheels are appreciated for their ability to turn in any
direction almost on the spot, allowing the robot to do the same and thereby
greatly simplifying the motion planning and control. However, in aligning the
caster wheels to the intended direction of motion they produce a so-called bore
torque. As a result, additional motor torque is required to move the robot,
which may in some cases exceed the motor capacity or compromise the motion
planner's accuracy. Instead of taking a decoupled approach, where the
navigation and disturbance rejection algorithms are separated, we propose to
embed the caster wheel awareness into the motion planner. To do so, we present
a caster-wheel-aware term that is compatible with MPC-based control methods,
leveraging the existence of caster wheels in the motion planning stage. As a
proof of concept, this term is combined with a a model-predictive trajectory
tracking controller. Since this method requires knowledge of the caster wheel
angle and rolling speed, an observer that estimates these states is also
presented. The efficacy of the approach is shown in experiments on an
intralogistics robot and compared against a decoupled bore-torque reduction

not. In QM, we prove the resurgent cancellation of the ambiguity in 3-instanton

survey the relevant observational data and aspects of disk dynamical theory.
The origin of the recurring spiral patterns in simulations of isolated disk
galaxies has recently become clear and it is likely that the mechanism is the
same in real galaxies, although evidence to confirm this supposition is hard to
obtain. As transient spiral activity increases random motion, the patterns must
fade over time unless the disk also contains a dissipative gas component.
Continuing spiral activity alters the structure of the disks in other ways:
reducing metallicity gradients and flattening rotation curves are two of the
most significant. The overwhelming majority of spirals in galaxies have two- or
three-fold rotational symmetry, indicating that the cool, thin disk component
is massive. Spirals in simulations of halo-dominated disks instead manifest
many arms, and consequently do not capture the expected full spiral-driven
evolution. We conclude by identifying areas where further work is needed.

with the possible detection of the pair density wave states. However,
microscopic calculations often struggle to stabilize such spatially modulating
orders as the ground state in the strong correlation limit. This work uses the
$t-t^\prime-J$-model with an additional nearest-neighbor repulsion to stabilize
spatially oscillating charge, bond, and pairing orders in the underdoped
regime. We employ the standard Gutzwiller approach while treating the
inhomogeneity for the spatial orders using the self-consistent
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov methodology. Our calculations reveal that
unidirectional bond density states coexisting with charge and pairing
modulations can have lower energy than the uniform superconducting state over
an extensive doping range. These modulating states vanish monotonically as the
modulation wavevector becomes shorter with increased dopings. The finite
momentum orders melt upon increasing doping to a vestigial nematic state which
breaks the rotational symmetry of the system. The spatial features of the
ground state at each doping reveal multiple wavevectors, which potentially
drives the incommensuration of charge orders. Interestingly, the spatially
modulating states are absent when the strong correlations criteria are relaxed,
suggesting that the removal of double occupancy aids the stabilization of
density wave orders.

additional cost for a guaranteed, reliable supply of energy (i.e., energy
storage). This investigation aims to decrease the additional cost by
introducing probabilistic multi-task intra-hour solar forecasting (feasible in
real time applications) to increase the penetration of photovoltaic systems in
power grids. The direction of moving clouds is estimated in consecutive
sequences of sky images by extracting features of cloud dynamics with the
objective of forecasting the global solar irradiance that reaches photovoltaic
systems. The sky images are acquired using a low-cost infrared sky imager
mounted on a solar tracker. The solar forecasting algorithm is based on kernel
learning methods, and uses the clear sky index as predictor and features
extracted from clouds as feature vectors. The proposed solar forecasting
algorithm achieved 16.45\% forecasting skill 8 minutes ahead with a resolution
of 15 seconds. In contrast, previous work reached 15.4\% forecasting skill with
the resolution of 1 minute. Therefore, this solar forecasting algorithm
increases the performances with respect to the state-of-the-art, providing grid
operators with the capability of managing the inherent uncertainties of power
grids with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems.

relations. Some companies -- in the case of their default -- can trigger
significant cascades of shock in the supply-chain network and are thus
systemically risky. Up to now, systemic risk of individual companies was
practically not quantifiable, due to the unavailability of firm-level
transaction data. So far, economic shocks are typically studied in the
framework of input-output analysis on the industry-level that can't relate risk
to individual firms. Exact firm-level supply networks based on tax or payment
data exist only for very few countries. Here we explore to what extent
telecommunication data can be used as an inexpensive, easily available, and
real-time alternative to reconstruct national supply networks on the
firm-level. We find that the conditional probability of correctly identifying a
true customer-supplier link -- given a communication link exists -- is about
90%. This quality level allows us to reliably estimate a systemic risk profile
of an entire country that serves as a proxy for the resilience of its economy.
In particular, we are able to identify the high systemic risk companies. We
find that 65 firms have the potential to trigger large cascades of disruption
in production chains that could cause severe damages in the economy. We verify
that the topological features of the inter-firm communication network are
highly similar to national production networks with exact firm-level

inputs. A commonly used defense is adversarial training, whose performance is
influenced by model capacity. While previous works have studied the impact of
varying model width and depth on robustness, the impact of increasing capacity
by using learnable parametric activation functions (PAFs) has not been studied.
We study how using learnable PAFs can improve robustness in conjunction with
adversarial training. We first ask the question: how should we incorporate
parameters into activation functions to improve robustness? To address this, we
analyze the direct impact of activation shape on robustness through PAFs and
observe that activation shapes with positive outputs on negative inputs and
with high finite curvature can increase robustness. We combine these properties
to create a new PAF, which we call Parametric Shifted Sigmoidal Linear Unit
(PSSiLU). We then combine PAFs (including PReLU, PSoftplus and PSSiLU) with
adversarial training and analyze robust performance. We find that PAFs optimize
towards activation shape properties found to directly affect robustness.
Additionally, we find that while introducing only 1-2 learnable parameters into
the network, smooth PAFs can significantly increase robustness over ReLU. For
instance, when trained on CIFAR-10 with additional synthetic data, PSSiLU
improves robust accuracy by 4.54% over ReLU on ResNet-18 and 2.69% over ReLU on
WRN-28-10 in the $\ell_{\infty}$ threat model while adding only 2 additional
parameters into the network architecture. The PSSiLU WRN-28-10 model achieves

eccentricity. Modeling the dynamics with the condition that the system remain

wildlife monitoring. Such surveys require automatic detection of target sound
events. However, current detectors, especially those relying on band-limited
energy, are severely impacted by wind. The rapid dynamics of this noise
invalidate standard noise estimators, and no satisfactory method for dealing
with it exists in bioacoustics, where simple training and generalization
between conditions are important. We propose to estimate the transient noise
level by fitting short-term spectrum models to a wavelet packet representation.
This estimator is then combined with log-spectral subtraction to stabilize the
background level. The resulting adjusted wavelet series can be analysed by
standard energy detectors. We use real monitoring data to tune this workflow,
and test it on two acoustic surveys of birds. Additionally, we show how the
estimator can be incorporated in a denoising method to restore sound. The
proposed noise-robust workflow greatly reduced the number of false alarms in
the surveys, compared to unadjusted energy detection. As a result, the survey
efficiency (precision of the estimated call density) improved for both species.
Denoising was also more effective when using the short-term estimate, whereas
standard wavelet shrinkage with a constant noise estimate struggled to remove
the effects of wind. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed estimator
can adjust for transient broadband noises without requiring additional hardware
or extensive tuning to each species. It improved the detection workflow based
on very little training data, making it particularly attractive for detection
of rare species.

that captures the essence of the MRI-driven accretion, without resorting to 3D
global non-ideal MHD simulations. The gas dynamics is assumed to be solely
controlled by the MRI and hydrodynamic instabilities. For given stellar and
disk parameters, the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is determined
self-consistently under the framework of viscously-driven accretion from
detailed considerations of the MRI with non-ideal MHD effects (Ohmic
resistivity and ambipolar diffusion), accounting for disk heating by stellar
irradiation, non-thermal sources of ionization, and dust effects on the
ionization chemistry. Additionally, the magnetic field strength is constrained
and adopted to maximize the MRI activity. We demonstrate the use of our
framework by investigating steady-state MRI-driven accretion in a fiducial
protoplanetary disk model around a solar-type star. We find that the
equilibrium solution displays no pressure maximum at the dead zone outer edge,
except if a sufficient amount of dust particles have accumulated there before
the disk reaches a steady-state accretion regime. Furthermore, the steady-state
accretion solution describes a disk that displays a spatially extended
long-lived inner disk gas reservoir (the dead zone) accreting a few $10^{-9}\,
M_{\odot}.\rm{yr}^{-1}$. By conducting a detailed parameter study, we find that
the extend to which the MRI can drive efficient accretion is primarily
determined by the total disk gas mass, the representative grain size, the
vertically-integrated dust-to-gas mass ratio, and the stellar X-ray luminosity.
A self-consistent time-dependent coupling between gas, dust, stellar evolution
models and our general framework on million-year timescales is required to
fully understand the formation of dead zones and their potential to trap dust
particles.

principal-agent model without transfers. An agent is engaged in a task with
uncertain future rewards and can choose to shirk at any time. The principal
knows the reward of the task and provides information to the agent over time.
The optimal information policy can be characterized in closed form, revealing
two key conditions that make dynamic disclosure valuable: one is that the
principal is impatient compared with the agent; the other is that the
environment makes the agent become pessimistic over time without any
information disclosure. In a stationary environment, the principal benefits
from dynamic disclosure if and only if she is less patient than the agent.
Maximum delayed disclosure is optimal for an impatient principal: the principal
delays all disclosures up to the maximum time threshold and then fully
discloses. By contrast, in a pessimistic environment, the principal always
benefits from dynamic disclosure, but the level of patience is still a crucial
determinant of the structure of the optimal policy.

Molecular Field (LMF) theory and the recently proposed AI-based analysis tool
""State predictive information bottleneck"" (SPIB) we show that the system with
short range interactions can accurately reproduce the transition rate for the
dissociation process, the dynamics for moving between the underlying metastable
states, and the transition state ensemble. Contributions from long range
interactions can be largely neglected for these processes because long range
forces from the direct interionic Coulomb interactions are almost completely
canceled ($>90\%$) by those from solvent interactions over the length scale
where the transition takes place. Thus for this important monovalent ion-pair
system, short range forces alone are able to capture detailed consequences of
the collective solvent motion, allowing the use of physically suggestive and
computationally efficient short range models for the disassociation event. We
believe that the framework here should be applicable to disentangling
mechanisms for more complex processes such as multivalent ion disassociation,
where previous work has suggested that long range contributions may be more
important.

from the simultaneous detection of spectral kink, quasiparticle peak, Fermi
gap, and their evolution with the temperature. The observation of
Bogoliubov-like back-bending bands at low temperatures, signaling electron-hole
pairing, further supports the presence of superconductivity in this system. The
photoemission experiment also provides evidence for a formation of a pseudogap
state at high temperatures, characterized by the progressive quenching of the
quasiparticle peak feature coexisting with a persistent gap at the Fermi level,
a behavior reminiscent of high-Tc superconductors. We attributed the origin of
superconductivity in these VSe2 films to a modified Fermi surface combined with
the formation of van Hove singularity points with a binding energy
corresponding to the chemical potential of the system. Although Tc cannot be

disease. 2D ultrasound is the most widely used non-invasive tool for screening
and monitoring, but associated diagnoses are highly subjective. We developed a
scalable deep learning (DL) algorithm for quantitative scoring of liver
steatosis from 2D ultrasound images.
  Approach & Results: Using retrospectively collected multi-view ultrasound
data from 3,310 patients, 19,513 studies, and 228,075 images, we trained a DL
algorithm to diagnose steatosis stages (healthy, mild, moderate, or severe)
from ultrasound diagnoses. Performance was validated on two multi-scanner
unblinded and blinded (initially to DL developer) histology-proven cohorts (147
and 112 patients) with histopathology fatty cell percentage diagnoses, and a
subset with FibroScan diagnoses. We also quantified reliability across scanners
and viewpoints. Results were evaluated using Bland-Altman and receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The DL algorithm demonstrates
repeatable measurements with a moderate number of images (3 for each viewpoint)
and high agreement across 3 premium ultrasound scanners. High diagnostic
performance was observed across all viewpoints: area under the curves of the
ROC to classify >=mild, >=moderate, =severe steatosis grades were 0.85, 0.90,
and 0.93, respectively. The DL algorithm outperformed or performed at least
comparably to FibroScan with statistically significant improvements for all
levels on the unblinded histology-proven cohort, and for =severe steatosis on
the blinded histology-proven cohort.
  Conclusions: The DL algorithm provides a reliable quantitative steatosis
assessment across view and scanners on two multi-scanner cohorts. Diagnostic
performance was high with comparable or better performance than FibroScan.

in a broad range of deep neural network (DNN) involved applications like
computer vision and natural language processing, the theoretical validation of
the improved generalization of a winning ticket remains elusive. To the best of
our knowledge, our work, for the first time, characterizes the performance of
training a pruned neural network by analyzing the geometric structure of the
objective function and the sample complexity to achieve zero generalization
error. We show that the convex region near a desirable model with guaranteed
generalization enlarges as the neural network model is pruned, indicating the
structural importance of a winning ticket. Moreover, when the algorithm for
training a pruned neural network is specified as an (accelerated) stochastic
gradient descent algorithm, we theoretically show that the number of samples
required for achieving zero generalization error is proportional to the number
of the non-pruned weights in the hidden layer. With a fixed number of samples,
training a pruned neural network enjoys a faster convergence rate to the
desired model than training the original unpruned one, providing a formal
justification of the improved generalization of the winning ticket. Our
theoretical results are acquired from learning a pruned neural network of one

evaluate methods on domains beyond those traditionally studied in architecture
search, and use it to address the following question: do state-of-the-art NAS

ten tasks spanning a diverse array of application domains, dataset sizes,
problem dimensionalities, and learning objectives. Each task is carefully
chosen to interoperate with modern CNN-based search methods while possibly
being far-afield from its original development domain. To speed up and reduce
the cost of NAS research, for two of the tasks we release the precomputed
performance of 15,625 architectures comprising a standard CNN search space.
Experimentally, we show the need for more robust NAS evaluation of the kind
NAS-Bench-360 enables by showing that several modern NAS procedures perform
inconsistently across the ten tasks, with many catastrophically poor results.
We also demonstrate how NAS-Bench-360 and its associated precomputed results
will enable future scientific discoveries by testing whether several recent

1960s, there have been numerous successes in the exciting new frontier of
asymmetric catalysis. However, most industrial and academic asymmetric
catalysis nowadays do follow the trial-and-error model, since the energetic
difference for success or failure in asymmetric catalysis is incredibly small.
Our current understanding about stereoselective reactions is mostly qualitative
that stereoselectivity arises from differences in steric effects and electronic
effects in multiple competing mechanistic pathways. Quantitatively
understanding and modulating the stereoselectivity of for a given chemical
reaction still remains extremely difficult. As a proof of principle, we herein
present a novel machine learning technique, which combines a LASSO model and
two Random Forest model via two Gaussian Mixture models, for quantitatively
predicting stereoselectivity of chemical reactions. Compared to the recent

between features and exploit complex data distributions, which are important
for predicting stereoselectivity. Experimental results on a recently published

  long-term harms",,,,"cs.LG cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Differentially Private (DP) learning has seen limited success for building
large deep learning models of text, and straightforward attempts at applying
Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to NLP tasks have
resulted in large performance drops and high computational overhead. We show
that this performance drop can be mitigated with (1) the use of large
pretrained language models; (2) non-standard hyperparameters that suit DP
optimization; and (3) fine-tuning objectives which are aligned with the
pretraining procedure. With the above, we obtain NLP models that outperform
state-of-the-art DP-trained models under the same privacy budget and strong
non-private baselines -- by directly fine-tuning pretrained models with DP
optimization on moderately-sized corpora. To address the computational
challenge of running DP-SGD with large Transformers, we propose a memory saving
technique that allows clipping in DP-SGD to run without instantiating
per-example gradients for any linear layer in the model. The technique enables
privately training Transformers with almost the same memory cost as non-private
training at a modest run-time overhead. Contrary to conventional wisdom that DP
optimization fails at learning high-dimensional models (due to noise that
scales with dimension) empirical results reveal that private learning with
pretrained language models doesn't tend to suffer from dimension-dependent
performance degradation. Code to reproduce results can be found at

scattering of cold molecules in a magnetic field can be efficiently computed
using the total angular momentum representation despite the presence of
unphysical Zeeman states in the eigenspectrum of the asymptotic Hamiltonian. We
demonstrate that the unphysical states arise due to the incompleteness of the
space-fixed total angular momentum basis caused by using a fixed cutoff value
$J_\text{max}$ for the total angular momentum of the collision complex $J$. As
a result, certain orbital angular momentum ($l$) basis states lack the full
range of $J$ values required by the angular momentum addition rules, resulting
in the appearance of unphysical states. We find that by augmenting the basis
with a full range of $J$-states for every $l$, it is possible to completely
eliminate the unphysical states from quantum scattering calculations on
molecular collisions in external fields. To illustrate the procedure, we use
the augmented basis sets to calculate the state-to-state cross sections for
rotational and spin relaxation in cold collisions of
$^{40}$CaH$(X^2\Sigma^+,v=0,N=1, M_N=1, M_S=1/2)$ molecules with $^4$He atoms

the agents' strategies. We propose an algorithm in which each agent
independently runs optimistic V-learning (a variant of Q-learning) to
efficiently explore the unknown environment, while using a stabilized online
mirror descent (OMD) subroutine for policy updates. We show that the agents can
find an $\epsilon$-approximate CCE in at most $\widetilde{O}( H^6S A
/\epsilon^2)$ episodes, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the size of
the largest individual action space, and $H$ is the length of an episode. This
appears to be the first sample complexity result for learning in generic
general-sum Markov games. Our results rely on a novel investigation of an
anytime high-probability regret bound for OMD with a dynamic learning rate and
weighted regret, which would be of independent interest. One key feature of our
algorithm is that it is fully \emph{decentralized}, in the sense that each
agent has access to only its local information, and is completely oblivious to
the presence of others. This way, our algorithm can readily scale up to an
arbitrary number of agents, without suffering from the exponential dependence

However, only non-unity diagonal elements of the permeability tensor have been

Specifically, we establish two quantum algorithms -- Fourier-based and

The Fourier-based algorithm is limited to translationally invariant QFTs.

the cost of preparing particle excitations in the wavelet approach is
independent of the energy scale. Our algorithms require a routine for

neural circuits. Existing methods for AD prediction have achieved great
success, however, detecting abnormal neural circuits from the perspective of
brain networks is still a big challenge. In this work, a novel decoupling
generative adversarial network (DecGAN) is proposed to detect abnormal neural
circuits for AD. Concretely, a decoupling module is designed to decompose a
brain network into two parts: one part is composed of a few sparse graphs which
represent the neural circuits largely determining the development of AD; the
other part is a supplement graph, whose influence on AD can be ignored.
Furthermore, the adversarial strategy is utilized to guide the decoupling
module to extract the feature more related to AD. Meanwhile, by encoding the
detected neural circuits to hypergraph data, an analytic module associated with
the hyperedge neurons algorithm is designed to identify the neural circuits.
More importantly, a novel sparse capacity loss based on the spatial-spectral
hypergraph similarity is developed to minimize the intrinsic topological
distribution of neural circuits, which can significantly improve the accuracy
and robustness of the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed model can effectively detect the abnormal neural circuits at different
stages of AD, which is helpful for pathological study and early treatment.

particular, our multi-task based approach treats predicting each annotators'
judgements as separate subtasks, while sharing a common learned representation
of the task. We show that this approach yields same or better performance than
aggregating labels in the data prior to training across seven different binary
classification tasks. Our approach also provides a way to estimate uncertainty
in predictions, which we demonstrate better correlate with annotation
disagreements than traditional methods. Being able to model uncertainty is
especially useful in deployment scenarios where knowing when not to make a
prediction is important.

navigate an intelligent agent to an expected position through natural language
instructions. This work addresses the task of VLN from a previously-ignored
aspect, namely the spatial route prior of the navigation scenes. A critically
enabling innovation of this work is explicitly considering the spatial route
prior under several different VLN settings. In a most information-rich case of
knowing environment maps and admitting shortest-path prior, we observe that
given an origin-destination node pair, the internal route can be uniquely
determined. Thus, VLN can be effectively formulated as an ordinary
classification problem over all possible destination nodes in the scenes.
Furthermore, we relax it to other more general VLN settings, proposing a
sequential-decision variant (by abandoning the shortest-path route prior) and
an explore-and-exploit scheme (for addressing the case of not knowing the
environment maps) that curates a compact and informative sub-graph to exploit.
As reported by [34], the performance of VLN methods has been stuck at a plateau
in past two years. Even with increased model complexity, the state-of-the-art
success rate on R2R validation-unseen set has stayed around 62% for single-run
and 73% for beam-search with model-ensemble. We have conducted comprehensive
evaluations on both R2R and R4R, and surprisingly found that utilizing the
spatial route priors may be the key of breaking above-mentioned performance
ceiling. For example, on R2R validation-unseen set, when the number of discrete
nodes explored is about 40, our single-model success rate reaches 73%, and
increases to 78% if a Speaker model is ensembled, which significantly outstrips
previous state-of-the-art VLN-BERT with 3 models ensembled.

and BERT have significantly facilitated the sequential recommendation. However,
according to our study, the distribution of item embeddings generated by these
models tends to degenerate into an anisotropic shape, which may result in high
semantic similarities among embeddings. In this paper, both empirical and
theoretical investigations of this representation degeneration problem are
first provided, based on which a novel recommender model DuoRec is proposed to
improve the item embeddings distribution. Specifically, in light of the
uniformity property of contrastive learning, a contrastive regularization is
designed for DuoRec to reshape the distribution of sequence representations.
Given the convention that the recommendation task is performed by measuring the
similarity between sequence representations and item embeddings in the same
space via dot product, the regularization can be implicitly applied to the item
embedding distribution. Existing contrastive learning methods mainly rely on
data level augmentation for user-item interaction sequences through item
cropping, masking, or reordering and can hardly provide semantically consistent
augmentation samples. In DuoRec, a model-level augmentation is proposed based
on Dropout to enable better semantic preserving. Furthermore, a novel sampling
strategy is developed, where sequences having the same target item are chosen
hard positive samples. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DuoRec model compared with
baseline methods. Visualization results of the learned representations validate
that DuoRec can largely alleviate the representation degeneration problem.

Generally, a scene graph prefers to be an omniscient generalist, while the
image caption is more willing to be a specialist, which outlines the gist. Lots
of previous studies have found that a scene graph is not as practical as
expected unless it can reduce the trivial contents and noises. In this respect,
the image caption is a good tutor. To this end, we let the scene graph borrow
the ability from the image caption so that it can be a specialist on the basis
of remaining all-around, resulting in the so-called Topic Scene Graph. What an
image caption pays attention to is distilled and passed to the scene graph for
estimating the importance of partial objects, relationships, and events.
Specifically, during the caption generation, the attention about individual
objects in each time step is collected, pooled, and assembled to obtain the
attention about relationships, which serves as weak supervision for
regularizing the estimated importance scores of relationships. In addition, as
this attention distillation process provides an opportunity for combining the
generation of image caption and scene graph together, we further transform the
scene graph into linguistic form with rich and free-form expressions by sharing
a single generation model with image caption. Experiments show that attention
distillation brings significant improvements in mining important relationships
without strong supervision, and the topic scene graph shows great potential in
subsequent applications.

with the measured degree of linear polarization from both Luhman 16 A and B.
Our calculations reproduce the measured polarization for both the objects with
cloud particle sizes between 0.5-1 \,$\mu$m for Luhman 16 A and 5 \,$\mu$m for
Luhman 16 B. We find that the degree of linear polarization can vary on
hour-long timescales over the course of a rotation period. We also show that
models with azimuthally symmetric band-like cloud geometries, typically used
for interpreting polarimetry observations of brown dwarfs, over-predict the
polarization signal if the cloud patterns do not include complex vortices
within these bands. This exploratory work shows that GCMs are promising for
modeling and interpreting polarization signals of brown dwarfs.

attributes of intelligence. In reinforcement learning, this is often modeled
through temporally extended courses of actions called options. Options allow
agents to make predictions and to operate at different levels of abstraction
within an environment. Nevertheless, approaches based on the options framework
often start with the assumption that a reasonable set of options is known
beforehand. When this is not the case, there are no definitive answers for
which options one should consider. In this paper, we argue that the successor
representation (SR), which encodes states based on the pattern of state
visitation that follows them, can be seen as a natural substrate for the
discovery and use of temporal abstractions. To support our claim, we take a big
picture view of recent results, showing how the SR can be used to discover
options that facilitate either temporally-extended exploration or planning. We
cast these results as instantiations of a general framework for option
discovery in which the agent's representation is used to identify useful
options, which are then used to further improve its representation. This
results in a virtuous, never-ending, cycle in which both the representation and
the options are constantly refined based on each other. Beyond option discovery
itself, we also discuss how the SR allows us to augment a set of options into a
combinatorially large counterpart without additional learning. This is achieved
through the combination of previously learned options. Our empirical evaluation
focuses on options discovered for exploration and on the use of the SR to
combine them. The results of our experiments shed light on important design
decisions involved in the definition of options and demonstrate the synergy of
different methods based on the SR, such as eigenoptions and the option
keyboard.

localization (WSOL). While most previous efforts rely on high-level feature
based CAMs (Class Activation Maps), this paper proposes to localize objects
using the low-level feature based activation maps. In the first stage, an
activation map generator produces activation maps based on the low-level
feature maps in the classifier, such that rich contextual object information is
included in an online manner. In the second stage, we employ an evaluator to
evaluate the activation maps predicted by the activation map generator. Based
on this, we further propose a weighted entropy loss, an attentive erasing, and
an area loss to drive the activation map generator to substantially reduce the
uncertainty of activations between object and background, and explore less
discriminative regions. Based on the low-level object information preserved in
the first stage, the second stage model gradually generates a well-separated,
complete, and compact activation map of object in the image, which can be
easily thresholded for accurate localization. Extensive experiments on
CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K datasets show that our framework surpasses
previous methods by a large margin, which sets a new state-of-the-art for WSOL.

First, a sketch parser translates the question into a high-level program
sketch, which is the composition of functions. Second, given the question and

in turn used to detect different topological phases in experiments. Recently,
with the discovery of various higher-order topological insulators, such
spectral topological characteristics are extended from edge states to corner
states. However, the chiral symmetry protecting the corner states is often
broken in genuine materials, leading to vulnerable corner states even when the
higher-order topological numbers remain quantized and invariant. Here, we show
that a local artificial gauge flux can serve as a robust probe of the Wannier
type higher-order topological insulators which is effective even when the
chiral symmetry is broken. The resultant observable signature is the emergence
of the cyclic spectral flows traversing one or multiple band gaps. These
spectral flows are associated with the local modes bound to the artificial
gauge flux. This phenomenon is essentially due to the cyclic transformation of
the Wannier orbitals when the local gauge flux acts on them. We extend

wireless link and their power constraints limit the amount of data that can be
transmitted to the cloud. While this is not problematic for the monitoring of
slowly varying processes such as temperature, it is more problematic for
complex signals such as those captured by vibration and acoustic sensors. In
this paper, we consider the specific problem of remote anomaly detection based
on signals that fall into the latter category over wireless channels with
resource-constrained sensors. We study the impact of source coding on the
detection accuracy with both an anomaly detector based on Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and one based on an autoencoder. We show that the coded
transmission is beneficial when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel
is low, while uncoded transmission performs best in the high SNR regime.

private or common randomness independent of environment does not benefit either

numerically for LQG team vs team zero sum game. Finally, we show for discrete

Despite significant diurnal variation, time-of-day (TOD) is rarely recorded or

preferences, and daytime alertness vary across individuals, known as sleep
chronotypes. Here, we performed graph-theory network analysis on resting-state
functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data to explore topological differences in whole-brain
functional networks between morning and evening sessions (TOD effect), and
between extreme morning-type and evening-type chronotypes. To that end, 62
individuals (31 extreme morning, 31 evening-type) underwent two fMRI sessions:
about 1 hour after the wake-up time (morning), and 10 hours thereafter,
scheduled in accord with their declared habitual sleep-wake pattern. TOD
significantly altered functional connectivity (FC) patterns, but there was no
significant difference in chronotypic categories. Compared to the morning
session, we found relatively increased small-worldness, modularity,
assortativity, and synchronization in the evening session, indicating more
efficient functional topology. Local measures were changed during the day
predominantly across the areas involved in somatomotor, ventral attention, as
well as default mode networks. Also, connectivity and hub analyses showed that
the somatomotor, ventral attention, and visual networks are the most
densely-connected brain areas in both sessions, respectively, with the first
being more active in the evening session and the two latter in the morning
session. Collectively, these findings suggest TOD can impact classic analyses
used in human neuroimaging such as functional connectivity, and should be
recorded and included in the analysis of functional neuroimaging data.

variation of internal energy of an open quantum system driven by an external
classical field. These quantities are measured by coupling the quantum system
to a quantum detector at different times. This approach allows us to preserve
the full quantum features of the evolution. From the measured phase, we are
able to obtain a quasi-characteristic function and a quasi-probability density
function for the corresponding observables. Despite the fact that these
quasi-probability density functions are not the results of direct measurements,
they reproduce the expected value of the physical quantities. Analogously to
the Wigner function, the negative regions of these quasi-probability density
functions are directly related to pure quantum processes which are not
interpretable in classical terms. We use this feature to show that in the limit
of strong dissipation, the quantum features vanish and interpret this as the
emergence of the classical limit of the energy exchange process. Our analysis
explains and confirms the behavior observed in recent experiments performed on
IBMQ devices [1]. The possibility to discriminate between classical and quantum
features makes the proposed approach an excellent tool to determine if, and in
which conditions, quantum effects can be exploited to increase the efficiency
in an energy exchange process at the quantum level.

collaborative multi-object navigation task CoMON. In this task, an oracle agent
has detailed environment information in the form of a map. It communicates with
a navigator agent that perceives the environment visually and is tasked to find
a sequence of goals. To succeed at the task, effective communication is
essential. CoMON hence serves as a basis to study different communication
mechanisms between heterogeneous agents, that is, agents with different
capabilities and roles. We study two common communication mechanisms and
analyze their communication patterns through an egocentric and spatial lens. We
show that the emergent communication can be grounded to the agent observations

generating 3D object shapes. They leverage implicit decoder trained to take a
3D point coordinate concatenated with a shape encoding and to output a value
which indicates whether the point is outside the shape or not. Although this
approach enables efficient rendering of visually plausible objects, it has two
significant limitations. First, it is based on a single neural network
dedicated for all objects from a training set which results in a cumbersome
training procedure and its application in real life. More importantly, the
implicit decoder takes only points sampled within voxels (and not the entire
voxels) which yields problems at the classification boundaries and results in
empty spaces within the rendered mesh.
  To solve the above limitations, we introduce a new HyperCube architecture
based on interval arithmetic network, that enables direct processing of 3D
voxels, trained using a hypernetwork paradigm to enforce model convergence.
Instead of processing individual 3D samples from within a voxel, our approach
allows to input the entire voxel (3D cube) represented with its convex hull
coordinates, while the target network constructed by a hypernet assigns it to
an inside or outside category. As a result our HyperCube model outperforms the
competing approaches both in terms of training and inference efficiency, as

(ASV), especially with a well-recognized SOTA ASV model, ECAPA-TDNN [1], as a
downstream model. The representations from all hidden layers of the pre-trained
model are firstly averaged with learnable weights and then fed into the
ECAPA-TDNN as input features. The experimental results on Voxceleb dataset show
that the weighted average representation is significantly superior to FBank, a
conventional handcrafted feature for ASV. Our best single system achieves
0.537%, 0.569%, and 1.180% equal error rate (EER) on the three official trials
of VoxCeleb1, separately. Accordingly, the ensemble system with three
pre-trained models can further improve the EER to 0.479%, 0.536% and 1.023%.
Among the three evaluation trials, our best system outperforms the winner
system [2] of the VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge 2021 (VoxSRC2021) on
the VoxCeleb1-E trial.

we present the adaptive SR network which is optimized by minimizing the

collpase. Only a few simple but powerful tools exist so far. Two examples are
the spherical collapse model (SCM) and stable clustering hypothesis (SCH). We
present a new analytical tool, a two-body collapse model (TBCM), that plays the
same fundamental role as harmonic oscillator in dynamics. For convenience, TBCM
is formulated for gravity with any potential exponent $n$ in a static
background with a fixed damping ($n$=-1 for Newtonian gravity). The competition
between gravity, expanding background (or damping), and angular momentum
classifies two-body collapse into: 1) free fall collapse, where free fall time
is greater if same system starts to collapse at earlier time; 2) equilibrium
collapse that persists longer in time, whose perturbative solutions lead to
power-law evolution of system energy and momentum. Two critical values
$\beta_{s1}=1$ and $\beta_{s2}=1/3\pi$ are identified that quantifies the
competition between damping and gravity. Value $\beta_{s2}$ only exists for
discrete values of potential exponent $n=(2-6m)/(1+3m)=$ -1,-10/7... for
integer $m$. Critical density ratio ($\Delta_c=18\pi^2$) is obtained for $n$=-1
that is consistent with SCM. TBCM predicts angular velocity $\propto Hr^{-3/2}$
for two-body system of size $r$. The isothermal density is a result of
extremely fast mass accretion. TBCM is able to demonstrate SCH, i.e. mean
pairwise velocity (first moment) $\langle\Delta u\rangle=-Hr$. A generalized
SCH is developed for higher order moments $\langle\Delta
u^{2m+1}\rangle=-(2m+1)\langle\Delta u^{2m}\rangle Hr$ that is validated by
N-body simulation. Energy evolution in TBCM is independent of particle mass and
energy equipartition does not apply. TBCM can be considered as a non-radial
SCM. Both models predict the same critical density ratio, while TBCM contains
much richer information.

the large memory cost of storing dense vectors and the time-consuming nearest
neighbor search (NNS) in vector space. Therefore, we present RepCONC, a novel
retrieval model that learns discrete Representations via CONstrained
Clustering. RepCONC jointly trains dual-encoders and the Product Quantization
(PQ) method to learn discrete document representations and enables fast
approximate NNS with compact indexes. It models quantization as a constrained
clustering process, which requires the document embeddings to be uniformly
clustered around the quantization centroids and supports end-to-end
optimization of the quantization method and dual-encoders. We theoretically
demonstrate the importance of the uniform clustering constraint in RepCONC and
derive an efficient approximate solution for constrained clustering by reducing
it to an instance of the optimal transport problem. Besides constrained
clustering, RepCONC further adopts a vector-based inverted file system (IVF) to
support highly efficient vector search on CPUs. Extensive experiments on two
popular ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks show that RepCONC achieves better ranking
effectiveness than competitive vector quantization baselines under different
compression ratio settings. It also substantially outperforms a wide range of

this framework to parametric probabilistic modeling, motivated by the fact that
R\'enyi's information can be estimated in closed-form for Gaussian mixtures.
Based on this special connection, a novel generative model framework called the
structured generative model (SGM) is proposed that makes straightforward
optimization possible, because costs are scale-invariant, avoiding high
gradient variance while imposing less restrictions on absolute continuity,
which is a huge advantage in parametric information theoretic optimization. The
implementation employs a single neural network driven by an orthonormal input
appended to a single white noise source adapted to learn an infinite Gaussian
mixture model (IMoG), which provides an empirically tractable model
distribution in low dimensions. To train SGM, we provide three novel
variational cost functions, based on R\'enyi's second-order entropy and
divergence, to implement minimization of cross-entropy, minimization of
variational representations of $f$-divergence, and maximization of the evidence
lower bound (conditional probability). We test the framework for estimation of
mutual information and compare the results with the mutual information neural
estimation (MINE), for density estimation, for conditional probability
estimation in Markov models as well as for training adversarial networks. Our
preliminary results show that SGM significantly improves MINE estimation in
terms of data efficiency and variance, conventional and variational Gaussian
mixture models, as well as the performance of generative adversarial networks.

binomial (NB)distribution is used to study the effect of the overdispersion on
the shapes and possible reduction of dose-response curvature at high doses. The
error distribution is customized to include an adjustable parameter so that the
overdispersion parameter of NB is not constant but depends on the mean of the
distribution. The trends in predicted cell survival responses are compared with
the experimental data in low and high dose regions at various LET values for
proton, helium, and carbon ions. The cell survival responses calculated by the
present method reveal straightening of survival curves at high doses. This
suggests that the overdispersion causes the cell survival dose-response to
approximate log-linear behaviour at high doses. Comparison of the cell survival
predictions with the Particle Irradiation Data Ensemble (PIDE) shows that the
NB model provides better fits to the experimental data following low and
intermediate doses. Whereas the model predictions are not validated at tiny and
very high doses, nonetheless, the presented approach provides insight into

It is important to observe that the performance gap between L-MMSE and MR
combining increases with the number of antennas per AP and the SE of the LMMSE
estimator is lower than that of other estimators due to the lack of
phase-shifts knowledge.

However, such an open nature also brings obstacles to surveillance. For
alleviation, a surveillance oracle, or a cognitive communication entity needs
to identify and confirm the appearance of known or unknown signal sources in
real-time. In this paper, we provide a deep learning framework for RF signal
surveillance. Specifically, we jointly integrate the Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) and Quickest Detection (QD) to form a sequential signal surveillance
scheme. We first analyze the latent space characteristic of neural network
classification models, and then we leverage the response characteristics of DNN
classifiers and propose a novel method to transform existing DNN classifiers
into performance-assured binary abnormality detectors. In this way, we
seamlessly integrate the DNNs with the parametric quickest detection. Finally,
we propose an enhanced Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) algorithm with better
numerical stability for DNNs in signal surveillance systems to evolve
incrementally, we demonstrate that the zero-bias DNN is superior to regular DNN
models considering incremental learning and decision fairness. We evaluated the
proposed framework using real signal datasets and we believe this framework is
helpful in developing a trustworthy IoT ecosystem.

field theories, which is free from the sign problem unlike standard Monte Carlo
methods. One of the remaining issues is the application to gauge theories,
which is so far limited to U(1) and SU(2) gauge groups. In the case of higher
rank, it becomes highly nontrivial to restrict the number of representations in
the character expansion to be used in constructing the fundamental tensor. We
propose a practical strategy to accomplish this and demonstrate it in 2D U($N$)

obtain the singular-value spectrum of the fundamental tensor, which turns out
to have a definite profile in the large-$N$ limit. For the U($N$) case, in
particular, we show that the large-$N$ behavior of the singular-value spectrum
changes qualitatively at the critical coupling of the Gross-Witten-Wadia phase
transition. As an interesting consequence, we find a new type of volume
independence in the large-$N$ limit of the 2D U($N$) gauge theory with the
$\theta$ term in the strong coupling phase, which goes beyond the Eguchi-Kawai
reduction.

a sharp image from a blurred image. To solve this problem, existing methods
apply the Encode-Decode architecture to design the complex networks to make a
good performance. However, most of these methods use repeated up-sampling and
down-sampling structures to expand the receptive field, which results in
texture information loss during the sampling process and some of them design
the multiple stages that lead to difficulties with convergence. Therefore, our
model uses dilated convolution to enable the obtainment of the large receptive
field with high spatial resolution. Through making full use of the different
receptive fields, our method can achieve better performance. On this basis, we
reduce the number of up-sampling and down-sampling and design a simple network
structure. Besides, we propose a novel module using the wavelet transform,
which effectively helps the network to recover clear high-frequency texture
details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of real and synthetic

matter candidates in the galactic halo that interact with sodium and iodine
nuclei in the COSINE-100 experiment and produce energetic electrons that
accompany recoil nuclei via the the Migdal effect. The WIMP mass sensitivity of
previous COSINE-100 searches that relied on the detection of ionization signals
produced by target nuclei recoiling from elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering was
restricted to WIMP masses above $\sim$5 GeV/$c^2$ by the detectors' 1 keVee
energy-electron-equivalent threshold. The search reported here looks for recoil
signals enhanced by the Migdal electrons that are ejected during the scattering
process. This is particularly effective for the detection of low-mass WIMP
scattering from the crystals' sodium nuclei in which a relatively larger
fraction of the WIMP's energy is transferred to the nucleus recoil energy and
the excitation of its orbital electrons. In this analysis, the low-mass WIMP
search window of the COSINE-100 experiment is extended to WIMP mass down to 200
MeV/$c^2$. The low-mass WIMP sensitivity will be further improved by lowering
the analysis threshold based on a multivariable analysis technique. We consider
the influence of these improvements and recent developments in detector
performance to re-evaluate sensitivities for the future COSINE-200 experiment.
With a 0.2 keVee analysis threshold and high light-yield NaI(Tl) detectors (22

down to 20 MeV/$c^2$ and probe previously unexplored regions of parameter

where the goal is to rank candidate items given user contexts. Optimizing
ranking systems online means that the deployed system can serve user requests,
e.g., queries in the web search, and optimize the ranking policy by learning
from user interactions, e.g., clicks. Bandit is a general online learning
framework and can be used in our optimization task. However, due to the unique
features of ranking, there are several challenges in designing bandit
algorithms for ranking system optimization. In this dissertation, we study and
propose solutions for four challenges in optimizing ranking systems online:
effectiveness, safety, nonstationarity, and diversification. First, the
effectiveness is related to how fast the algorithm learns from interactions. We
study the effective online ranker evaluation task and propose the MergeDTS
algorithm to solve the problem effectively. Second, the deployed algorithm
should be safe, which means the algorithm only displays reasonable content to
user requests. To solve the safe online learning to rank problem, we propose
the BubbleRank algorithm. Third, as users change their preferences constantly,
the algorithm should handle the nonstationarity. We formulate this
nonstationary online learning to rank problem as cascade non-stationary bandits
and propose CascadeDUCB and CascadeSWUCB algorithms to solve the problem.
Finally, the contents in ranked lists should be diverse. We consider the
results diversification task and propose the CascadeHybird algorithm that
considers both the item relevance and results diversification when learning
from user interactions.

networks (as in the context of IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet) to increase the
reliability of the network. Packets are replicated onto redundant paths by a
replication function. Later the paths merge again and an elimination function
removes the duplicates. This redundancy scheme has an effect on the timing
behavior of time-sensitive networks and many challenges arise from conducting
timing analyses. The replication can induce a burstiness increase along the
paths of replicates, as well as packet mis-ordering that could increase the
delays in the crossed bridges or routers. The induced packet mis-ordering could
also negatively affect the interactions between the redundancy and scheduling
mechanisms such as traffic regulators (as with per-flow regulators and
interleaved regulators, implemented by TSN asynchronous traffic shaping). Using
the network calculus framework, we provide a method of worst-case timing
analysis for time-sensitive networks that implement redundancy mechanisms in
the general use case, i.e., at end-devices and/or intermediate nodes. We first
provide a network calculus toolbox for bounding the burstiness increase and the
amount of reordering caused by the elimination function of duplicate packets.
We then analyze the interactions with traffic regulators and show that their
shaping-for-free property does not hold when placed after a packet elimination
function. We provide a bound for the delay penalty when using per-flow
regulators and prove that the penalty is not bounded with interleaved
regulators. Finally, we use an industrial use-case to show the applicability
and the benefits of our findings.

the context of physical systems described by $4\times4$ Dirac Hamiltonians. The
general framework provides limited control over the resulting energy operator,
so that it can fail to have the required physical interpretation. We show that
this problem can be circumvented with the reducible Darboux transformation that
can preserve the required form of physical interactions by construction. To
demonstrate it explicitly, we focus on distortion scattering and spin-orbit
interaction of Dirac fermions in graphene. We use the reducible Darboux
transformation to construct exactly solvable models of these systems where
backscattering is absent, i.e. the models are reflectionless.

objective of the present study is to improve the prediction of surface wind
speed and precipitation by calibrating the Weather Research and Forecasting
(WRF) model parameters for the simulations of tropical cyclones over the Bay of
Bengal region. Ten tropical cyclones across different intensity categories
between 2011 and 2017 are selected for the calibration experiments. Eight
sensitive model parameters are calibrated by minimizing the prediction error
corresponding to 10m wind speed and precipitation, using a multiobjective
adaptive surrogate model-based optimization (MO-ASMO) framework. The 10m wind
speed and precipitation simulated by the default and calibrated parameter
values across different aspects are compared. The results show that the
calibrated parameters improved the prediction of 10m wind speed by 17.62% and
precipitation by 8.20% compared to the default parameters. The effect of
calibrated parameters on other model output variables, such as cyclone track
and intensities, and 500 hPa wind fields, is investigated. Eight tropical
cyclones across different categories between 2011 and 2018 are selected to
corroborate the performance of the calibrated parameter values for other
cyclone events. Finally, the robustness of the calibrated parameters across
different boundary conditions and grid resolutions is also examined. These
results will have significant implications for improving the predictability of
tropical cyclone characteristics. This allows us to better plan the adaptation
and mitigation strategies and thus help in preventing the adverse effects on
society.

representations of nodes that preserve the proximity between entities of
different nature. A family of approaches that are wildly adopted applies random
walk to generate a sequence of heterogeneous context, from which the embedding
is learned. However, due to the multipartite graph structure of HIN, hub nodes
tend to be over-represented in the sampled sequence, giving rise to imbalanced
samples of the network. Here we propose a new embedding method CoarSAS2hvec.
The self-avoid short sequence sampling with the HIN coarsening procedure
(CoarSAS) is utilized to better collect the rich information in HIN. An
optimized loss function is used to improve the performance of the HIN structure
embedding. CoarSAS2hvec outperforms nine other methods in two different tasks
on four real-world data sets. The ablation study confirms that the samples
collected by CoarSAS contain richer information of the network compared with
those by other methods, which is characterized by a higher information entropy.
Hence, the traditional loss function applied to samples by CoarSAS can also
yield improved results. Our work addresses a limitation of the
random-walk-based HIN embedding that has not been emphasized before, which can
shed light on a range of problems in HIN analyses.

of this swath of particles beyond Thebe's orbit, Hamilton and Kr\""uger (2008)
proposed that the dust particle motion is driven by a shadow resonance caused
by variable dust charging on the day and night side of Jupiter. However, the
model by Divine (1983) together with recent observations by the Juno spacecraft
indicates a warm and rather dense inner magnetosphere of Jupiter which implies
that the mechanism of the shadow resonance does not work. Instead we argue that
dust grains ejected from Thebe due to micrometeoroid bombardment become the
source of dust in the Thebe extension. We show that large (grain radii of a few
micrometers up to multi-micrometers) charged dust grains having significant
initial velocities oscillate in the Thebe extension. Smaller charged grains
(with sub-micrometer radii) ejected from Thebe do not spend much time in the
Thebe extension and migrate into the Thebe ring. At the same time, if such
grains are ejected from larger dust grains in the Thebe extension due to
fragmentation, they continue to oscillate within the Thebe extension for years.
We argue that fragmentation of large dust grains in the Thebe extension could
be the main source of sub-micrometer grains detected in the Thebe extension.

absorbers for the case where the host structure is well described as rigid
body. Accordingly, the analysis relies on the assumption that the impacts cause
immediate dissipation in the contact region, which is modeled in terms of a
known coefficient of restitution. When a flexible host structure is considered
instead, the impact absorber not only dissipates energy at the time instances
of impact, but it inflicts nonlinear energy scattering between structural
modes. Hence, it is crucial to account for such nonlinear energy transfers
yielding energy redistribution within the modal space of the structure. In the
present work, we develop a design approach for reonantly-driven, flexible host
structures. We demonstrate decoupling of the time scales of the impact and the
resonant vibration. On the long time scale, the dynamics can be properly
reduced to the fundamental harmonic of the resonant mode. A light impact
absorber responds to this enforced motion, and we recover the Slow Invariant
Manifold of the dynamics for the regime of two impacts per period. On the short
time scale, the contact mechanics and elasto-dynamics must be finely resolved.
We show that it is sufficient to run a numerical simulation of a single impact
event with adequate pre-impact velocity. From this simulation, we derive a
modal coefficient of restitution and the properties of the contact force pulse,
needed to approximate the behavior on the long time scale. We establish that
the design problem can be reduced to four dimensionless parameters and
demonstrate the approach for the numerical example of a cantilevered beam with
an impact absorber. We conclude that the proposed semi-analytical procedure
enables deep qualitative understanding of the problem and, at the same time,
yields a quantitatively accurate prediction of the optimum design.

of the water curtain with sprayed droplets is determined through parametric
simulations with different water mass loadings and droplet sizes. The influence
of water curtain length on the methane detonation is examined by the
trajectories of peak pressure and time history of average heat release rate.
The results indicate that the water curtain not only inhibit the incident
detonation wave, but also prevent the detonation re-ignition after the incident
wave is quenched. Moreover, unsteady response of gaseous methane detonation to
water curtain are analyzed. The detonation re-initiation process behind the
water curtain near the critical loading is also captured. In addition,
mechanism of detonation inhibition with fine water droplets are discussed. It
is found that energy and momentum exchanges start immediately when the

well behind the detonation wave due to the finitely long droplet heating
duration. It is shown that the convective heat transfer by water droplets plays
a significant role in quenching a detonation.

of numerical results that illustrate that the CFIER methodology leads to
important computational savings over the classical CFIE one, whenever iterative

to anticipate the interaction between tasks during training in order to choose
a dynamic re-weighting of the various task losses, which will (i) lead to
minimal worst-case loss and (ii) train on as many tasks as possible. After
demonstrating the efficacy of L-DRO on a small controlled synthetic setting, we
evaluate it on two realistic benchmarks: a multitask version of the CIFAR-100

two people to the third person. In this model, there is an assumption of the
independence of triadic relations, which means that the balance or imbalance of
one triangle does not affect another and the energy only depends on the number
of each type of triangle. There is evidence that in real network data, in
addition to third-order interactions (Heider Balance), higher-order
interactions also play a role. One step beyond the Heider Balance, the effect
of Quartic Balance has been studied by removing the assumption of triangular
independence. Application of quartic balance results in the influence of the
balanced or imbalanced state of neighboring triangles on each specific one.
Here, a question arises that how the Heider Balance is affected by the
existence of Quartic Balance (fourth-order). The phase diagram obtained from
the mean-field method shows there is a threshold for higher-order interaction
strength, below which a third-order interaction dominates and there are no
imbalance triangles in the network, and above this threshold, squares
effectively determine the balance state in which the imbalance triangles can
survive. The solution of the mean-field indicates that we have a first-order
phase transition in terms of random behavior of agents (temperature) which is

promising initial results, the ML-based syndrome decoders are still limited to
small scale demonstrations with low latency and are incapable of handling
surface codes with boundary conditions and various shapes needed for lattice

network (ANN) based scalable and fast syndrome decoder capable of decoding
surface codes of arbitrary shape and size with data qubits suffering from the

for various computing devices including heterogeneous devices, e.g., GPUs,
FPGAs, ASICs to achieve high performance. Modern workloads such as Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) running on these heterogeneous fabrics are highly dependent on
the on-chip memory architecture for efficient acceleration. Hence, improving
the energy-efficiency of such memories directly leads to an efficient system.
One of the common methods to save energy is undervolting i.e., supply voltage
underscaling below the nominal level. Such systems can be safely undervolted
without incurring faults down to a certain voltage limit. This safe range is
also called voltage guardband. However, reducing voltage below the guardband
level without decreasing frequency causes timing-based faults.
  In this paper, we propose MoRS, a framework that generates the first
approximate undervolting fault model using real faults extracted from
experimental undervolting studies on SRAMs to build the model. We inject the
faults generated by MoRS into the on-chip memory of the DNN accelerator to
evaluate the resilience of the system under the test. MoRS has the advantage of
simplicity without any need for high-time overhead experiments while being
accurate enough in comparison to a fully randomly-generated fault injection
approach. We evaluate our experiment in popular DNN workloads by mapping
weights to SRAMs and measure the accuracy difference between the output of the
MoRS and the real data. Our results show that the maximum difference between
real fault data and the output fault model of MoRS is 6.21%, whereas the
maximum difference between real data and random fault injection model is 23.2%.
In terms of average proximity to the real data, the output of MoRS outperforms
the random fault injection approach by 3.21x.

different retinal locations: the internal object representation is invariant to
translation. It is commonly believed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
are architecturally invariant to translation thanks to the convolution and/or
pooling operations they are endowed with. In fact, several studies have found
that these networks systematically fail to recognise new objects on untrained
locations. In this work, we test a wide variety of CNNs architectures showing
how, apart from DenseNet-121, none of the models tested was architecturally
invariant to translation. Nevertheless, all of them could learn to be invariant
to translation. We show how this can be achieved by pretraining on ImageNet,
and it is sometimes possible with much simpler data sets when all the items are
fully translated across the input canvas. At the same time, this invariance can
be disrupted by further training due to catastrophic forgetting/interference.
These experiments show how pretraining a network on an environment with the
right `latent' characteristics (a more naturalistic environment) can result in
the network learning deep perceptual rules which would dramatically improve
subsequent generalization.

grains, are heterogeneous, where individuals with differing properties
interact. The differences among individuals in their intrinsic properties have
emergent effects at the group level. It is often of interest to infer how the
intrinsic properties differ among the individuals, based on their observed
movement patterns. However, the true individual properties may be masked by
emergent effects in the collective. We investigate the inference problem in the
context of a bidisperse collective with two types of agents, where the goal is
to observe the motion of the collective and classify the agents according to
their types. Since collective effects such as jamming and clustering affect
individual motion, an agent's own movement does not have sufficient information
to perform the classification well: a simple observer algorithm, based only on
individual velocities cannot accurately estimate the level of heterogeneity of
the system, and often misclassifies agents. We propose a novel approach to the
classification problem, where collective effects on an agent's motion is
explicitly accounted for. We use insights about the physics of collective
motion to quantify the effect of the neighbourhood on an agent using a
neighbourhood parameter. Such an approach can distinguish between agents of two
types, even when their observed motion is identical. This approach estimates
the level of heterogeneity much more accurately, and achieves significant
improvements in classification. Our results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for neighbourhood effects is often necessary to correctly infer
intrinsic properties of individuals.

system. We show that heterogeneity can generically initiate segregation in the
motion and identify two heterogeneity mechanisms. Longitudinal lanes parallel
to the direction of motion emerge when the heterogeneity statically lies in the
agent characteristics (quenched disorder). While transverse bands orthogonal to
the motion direction arise from dynamic heterogeneity in the interactions
(annealed disorder). In both cases, non-linear transitions occur as the
heterogeneity increases, from disorder to ordered states with lane or band

integer values, and integer operators are used in the conditions. Most existing

Boolean conditions. This paper introduces an approach to convert integer-based
variability conditions to propositional logic. Running this approach as a
preparation on an integer-based product line allows the existing SAT-based
analyses to work without any modifications. The pure Boolean formulas, that our
approach builds as a replacement for the integer-based conditions, are mostly
equivalent to the original conditions with respect to satisfiability. Our
approach was motivated by and implemented in the context of a real-world
industrial case-study, where such a preparation was necessary to analyze the
variability. Our contribution is an approach to convert conditions, that use
integer variables, into propositional formulas, to enable easy usage of
SAT-solvers on the result. It works well on restricted variables (i.e.
variables with a small range of allowed values); unrestricted integer variables
are handled less exact, but still retain useful variability information.

However, commensurate progress has not been made on Sign Languages, in
particular, in recognizing signs as individual words or as complete sentences.
We introduce OpenHands, a library where we take four key ideas from the NLP
community for low-resource languages and apply them to sign languages for
word-level recognition. First, we propose using pose extracted through
pretrained models as the standard modality of data to reduce training time and
enable efficient inference, and we release standardized pose datasets for 6
different sign languages - American, Argentinian, Chinese, Greek, Indian, and
Turkish. Second, we train and release checkpoints of 4 pose-based isolated sign
language recognition models across all 6 languages, providing baselines and
ready checkpoints for deployment. Third, to address the lack of labelled data,
we propose self-supervised pretraining on unlabelled data. We curate and
release the largest pose-based pretraining dataset on Indian Sign Language
(Indian-SL). Fourth, we compare different pretraining strategies and for the
first time establish that pretraining is effective for sign language
recognition by demonstrating (a) improved fine-tuning performance especially in
low-resource settings, and (b) high crosslingual transfer from Indian-SL to few
other sign languages. We open-source all models and datasets in OpenHands with
a hope that it makes research in sign languages more accessible, available here

self-maintaining. The new design principles focus on functional survival of the
robots over long periods of time without human maintenance. Self-maintaining
semi-autonomous mobile robots are in great demand in nuclear disposal sites
from where their removal for maintenance is undesirable due to their
radioactive contamination. Similar are requirements for robots in various
defence tasks or space missions. For optimal design, modular solutions are
balanced against capabilities to replace smaller components in a robot by
itself or by help from another robot. Modules are proposed for the basic
platform, which enable self-maintenance within a team of robots helping each
other. The primary method of self-maintenance is replacement of malfunctioning
modules or components by the robots themselves. Replacement necessitates a
robot team's ability to diagnose and replace malfunctioning modules as needed.
Due to their design, these robots still remain manually re-configurable if
opportunity arises for human intervention. Apart from the basic principles, an
evolutionary design approach is presented and a first mathematical theory of
the reliability of a team of self-maintaining robots is introduced.

the boundary blur of the depth map is still a serious problem. Research finds
the boundary blur problem is mainly caused by two factors, first, the low-level
features containing boundary and structure information may loss in deeper
networks during the convolution process., second, the model ignores the errors
introduced by the boundary area due to the few portions of the boundary in the
whole areas during the backpropagation. In order to mitigate the boundary blur
problem, we focus on the above two impact factors. Firstly, we design a scene
understanding module to learn the global information with low- and high-level
features, and then to transform the global information to different scales with
our proposed scale transform module according to the different phases in the
decoder. Secondly, we propose a boundary-aware depth loss function to pay
attention to the effects of the boundary's depth value. The extensive
experiments show that our method can predict the depth maps with clearer
boundaries, and the performance of the depth accuracy base on NYU-depth v2 and

is able to effectively refine the ReID results, such as correcting the wrong

approach in software engineering in order to understand the state of a software
system, in particular to identify potential areas prone to defects.
Family-based techniques extract variability information from code artifacts in
Software Product Lines (SPLs) to perform static analysis for all available
variants. Many different types of metrics with numerous variants have been
defined in literature. When counting all metrics including such variants,
easily thousands of metrics can be defined. Computing all of them for large
product lines can be an extremely expensive process in terms of performance and
resource consumption.
  Objective: We address these performance and resource challenges while
supporting customizable metric suites, which allow running both, single system
and variability-aware code metrics.
  Method: In this paper, we introduce a partial parsing approach used for the
efficient measurement of more than 42,000 code metric variations. The approach
covers variability information and restricts parsing to the relevant parts of
the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
  Conclusions: This partial parsing approach is designed to cover all relevant
information to compute a broad variety of variability-aware code metrics on
code artifacts containing annotation-based variability, e.g., realized with
C-preprocessor statements. It allows for the flexible combination of single
system and variability-aware metrics, which is not supported by existing tools.
This is achieved by a novel representation of partially parsed product line
code artifacts, which is tailored to the computation of the metrics. Our
approach consumes considerably less resources, especially when computing many
metric variants in parallel.

radius of 5 nm. The effect of complex optical coupling and thermal accumulation
on the light-induced thermal behavior in plasmonic resonance frequency (around
383 nm) is analyzed by means of the Green\textquotesingle s function approach.
Regime borders of both optical coupling and thermal accumulation effects on the
photothermal behavior of 2D square-lattice nanoparticle ensemble are figured
out clearly and quantitatively. A dimensionless parameter $\varphi$ is defined
as the ratio of full temperature increase to that without considering the
optical coupling or thermal accumulation to quantify the optical coupling and
thermal accumulation effects on photothermal behavior. The more compact the
nanoparticle ensemble is, the stronger the optical coupling on thermal behavior
is. When the lattice spacing increases to tens of nanoparticle radius, the
optical coupling becomes insignificant. When $\varphi \approx 1$ (lattice
spacing increases to hundreds of nanoparticle radius), the thermal accumulation
effects are weak and can be neglected safely. The polarization-dependent
distribution of temperature increase of nanoparticles is observed only in the
compact nanoparticle ensemble, while for dilute ensemble, such
polarization-dependent temperature increase distribution can not be observed

critically on the presence and distribution of atmospheric condensates. The
Ackerman & Marley (2001) methodology for predicting the vertical distribution
of condensate particles is widely used to study cloudy atmospheres and has
recently been implemented in an open-source python package virga. The model
relies upon input parameter $f_{\text{sed}}$, the sedimentation efficiency,
which until now has been held constant. The relative simplicity of this model
renders it useful for retrieval studies due to its rapidly attainable
solutions. However, comparisons with more complex microphysical models such as
CARMA have highlighted inconsistencies between the two approaches, namely that
the cloud parameters needed for radiative transfer produced by virga are
dissimilar to those produced by CARMA. To address these discrepancies, we have
extended the original Ackerman and Marley methodology in virga to allow for
non-constant $f_{\text{sed}}$ values, in particular those that vary with
altitude. We discuss one such parameterization and compare the cloud mass
mixing ratio produced by virga with constant and variable $f_{\text{sed}}$
profiles to that produced by CARMA. We find that the variable $f_{\text{sed}}$
formulation better captures the profile produced by CARMA with heterogeneous
nucleation, yet performs comparatively to constant $f_{\text{sed}}$ for
homogeneous nucleation. In general, virga has the capacity to handle any
$f_{\text{sed}}$ with an explicit anti-derivative, permitting a plethora of
alternative cloud profiles that are otherwise unattainable by constant
$f_{\text{sed}}$ values. The ensuing flexibility has the potential to better
agree with increasingly complex models and observed data.

neglecting the potential low-level holistic clues in shallow layers. In this
paper, we first propose to transform a video sequence into a graph to obtain
direct long-term dependencies among temporal frames. To preserve sequential

achieving fine-grained temporal interactions throughout the entire network. In
particular, SGM divides the neighbors of each node into several temporal
regions so as to extract global structural information with diverse sequential
flows. Extensive experiments are performed on standard benchmark datasets,

help in the folding of chromatin but also in carrying epigenetic information.
It is known that nucleosome sliding is responsible for dynamically organizing
chromatin structure and the resulting gene regulation. Since sliding can move
two neighboring nucleosomes physically close or away, can it play a role in the
spreading of histone modifications? We investigate this by simulating a
stochastic model that couples nucleosome dynamics with the kinetics of histone
modifications. We show that the sliding of nucleosomes can affect the
modification pattern as well as the time it takes to modify a given region of
chromatin. Exploring different nucleosome densities and modification kinetic
parameters, we show that nucleosome sliding can be important for creating
histone modification domains. Our model predicts that nucleosome density
coupled with sliding dynamics can create an asymmetric histone modification
profile around regulatory regions. We also compute the probability distribution
of modified nucleosomes and relaxation kinetics of modifications. Our
predictions are comparable with known experimental results.

beamforming strategies at the base stations (BSs) and user equipments (UEs) can
be computed building on bi-directional training. However, the
precoding/decoding optimization in the downlink (DL) and in the uplink (UL)
generally requires two separate bi-directional training phases, which can be
wasteful in the case of short scheduling blocks. This paper proposes a
framework to reduce the bi-directional training overhead by considering a
common beamforming training strategy for both DL and UL when the UEs to be
served in the two directions are the same. In doing so, we consider the problem
of maximizing the (weighted) minimum DL-UL rate among all the UEs. Numerical
results show that, in scenarios with short scheduling blocks, the proposed
framework outperforms the case where the DL and UL beamforming strategies are
computed individually via two separate bi-directional training phases thanks to
the reduced training overhead. Even more substantial gains are observed with
respect to the case with a single bi-directional training phase, where the DL
(resp. UL) beamforming strategies are reused in the UL (resp. DL).

constants of nature. Fundamentally distinct times are associated with different
constants, a situation often found in ""relational time"" settings. We show in
detail how in regions dominated by a single constant the Hamiltonian constraint
can be reframed as a Schrodinger equation in the corresponding time, solved in
the connection representation by outgoing-only monochromatic plane waves moving
in a ""space"" that generalizes the Chern-Simons functional. We pay special
attention to the issues of unitarity and the measure employed for the inner
product. Normalizable superpositions can be built, including solitons,
""light-rays"" and coherent/squeezed states saturating a Heisenberg uncertainty
relation between constants and their times. A healthy classical limit is
obtained for factorizable coherent states, both in mono-fluid and multi-fluid
situations. For the latter, we show how to deal with transition regions, where
one is passing on the baton from one time to to another, and investigate the
fate of the subdominant clock. For this purpose minisuperspace is best seen as
a dispersive medium, with packets moving with a group speed distinct from the
phase speed. We show that the motion of the packets' peaks reproduces the
classical limit even during the transition periods, and for subdominant clocks
once the transition is over. Deviations from the coherent/semi-classical limit
are expected in these cases, however. The fact that we have recently
transitioned from a decelerating to an accelerating Universe renders this
proposal potentially testable, as explored elsewhere.

The lower T$_{c}$ of the Y-rich precipitates as compared to the bulk, is the
origin of flux compression and this leads to paramagnetic response. It is also
observed that the magnetisation obtained during field cooled (FC) cooling cycle
is lower than that of FC warming, for all the alloys in the field range 0.02-7
T. In addition, paramagnetic relaxation of FC moment is observed. We identify
that these features of Y containing alloys are related to the high field

(Mitchell 1980). Today, CNNs are incredibly powerful generalisation systems --
but to what degree have we understood how their inductive bias influences model
decisions? We here attempt to disentangle the various aspects that determine
how a model decides. In particular, we ask: what makes one model decide
differently from another? In a meticulously controlled setting, we find that
(1.) irrespective of the network architecture or objective (e.g.
self-supervised, semi-supervised, vision transformers, recurrent models) all
models end up with a similar decision boundary. (2.) To understand these
findings, we analysed model decisions on the ImageNet validation set from epoch
to epoch and image by image. We find that the ImageNet validation set, among
others, suffers from dichotomous data difficulty (DDD): For the range of
investigated models and their accuracies, it is dominated by 46.0% ""trivial""
and 11.5% ""impossible"" images (beyond label errors). Only 42.5% of the images
could possibly be responsible for the differences between two models' decision
boundaries. (3.) Only removing the ""impossible"" and ""trivial"" images allows us
to see pronounced differences between models. (4.) Humans are highly accurate
at predicting which images are ""trivial"" and ""impossible"" for CNNs (81.4%).
This implies that in future comparisons of brains, machines and behaviour, much
may be gained from investigating the decisive role of images and the
distribution of their difficulties.

frequency sweeps in microwave circuits by means of the reduced-basis method.
Contrary to what has been previously done, special emphasis is placed on
certifying the accuracy of the reduced-order model with respect to the original
full-order model in an effective and efficient way. Previous works on model
order reduction accuracy certification rely on costly $\textit{a posteriori}$
error estimators, which typically require expensive $\textit{inf-sup}$ constant
evaluations of the underlying full-order model. This scenario is often too
time-consuming and unaffordable in electromagnetic applications. As a result,
less expensive and heuristic error estimators are commonly used instead. Very
often, one is interested in knowing about the full state vector, instead of
just some output quantities derived from the full state. Therefore, error
estimators for the full state vector become relevant. In this work, we detail
the frequency behavior of both the electric field and the state error when an
approximation to the electric field solution is carried out. Both field
quantities share the same frequency behavior. Based on this observation, we
focus on the efficient estimation of the electric field state error and propose
a fast evaluation of the reduced-order model state error in the frequency band
of analysis, minimizing the number of full-order model evaluations. This
methodology is of paramount importance to carry out a reliable fast frequency
sweep in microwave circuits. Finally, real-life applications will illustrate
the capabilities and efficiency of the proposed approach.

significant advancements. However, the downside of deep learning is that it is
very data-hungry. Especially for segmentation problems, training a deep neural
net requires dense supervision in the form of pixel-perfect image labels, which
are very costly. In this paper, we present a new loss function to train a
segmentation network with only a small subset of pixel-perfect labels, but take
the advantage of weakly-annotated training samples in the form of cheap
bounding-box labels. Unlike recent works which make use of box-to-mask proposal
generators, our loss trains the network to learn a label uncertainty within the
bounding-box, which can be leveraged to perform online bootstrapping (i.e.
transforming the boxes to segmentation masks), while training the network. We
evaluated our method on binary segmentation tasks, as well as a multi-class
segmentation task (CityScapes vehicles and persons). We trained each task on a
dataset comprised of only 18% pixel-perfect and 82% bounding-box labels, and
compared the results to a baseline model trained on a completely pixel-perfect
dataset. For the binary segmentation tasks, our method achieves an IoU score
which is ~98.33% as good as our baseline model, while for the multi-class task,
our method is 97.12% as good as our baseline model (77.5 vs. 79.8 mIoU).

it or by others. We call the former self-fixed TD, and it can be particularly
effective, as developers are experts in their own code and are well-suited to
fix the corresponding TD issues. Objective: The goal of our study is to
investigate self-fixed technical debt, especially the extent in which TD is
self-fixed, which types of TD are more likely to be self-fixed, whether the
remediation time of self-fixed TD is shorter than non-self-fixed TD and how
development behaviors are related to self-fixed TD. Method: We report on an
empirical study that analyzes the self-fixed issues of five types of TD (i.e.,
Code, Defect, Design, Documentation and Test), captured via static analysis, in
more than 44,000 commits obtained from 20 Python and 16 Java projects of the
Apache Software Foundation. Results: The results show that about half of the
fixed issues are self-fixed and that the likelihood of contained TD issues
being self-fixed is negatively correlated with project size, the number of
developers and total issues. Moreover, there is no significant difference of
the survival time between self-fixed and non-self-fixed issues. Furthermore,
developers are more keen to pay back their own TD when it is related to lower
code level issues, e.g., Defect Debt and Code Debt. Finally, developers who are
more dedicated to or knowledgeable about the project contribute to a higher
chance of self-fixing TD. Conclusions: These results can benefit both
researchers and practitioners by aiding the prioritization of TD remediation
activities and refining strategies within development teams, and by informing
the development of TD management tools.

the optimisation of Robin boundary conditions in PDE constrained calculus of
variations. Our main model consists of an elliptic PDE of the form $-\Delta
u_\beta=f(x,u_\beta)$ endowed with the Robin boundary conditions $\partial_\nu
u_\beta+\beta(x)u_\beta=0$. The optimisation variable is the function $\beta$,
which is assumed to take values between 0 and 1 and to have a fixed integral.
Two types of criteria are under consideration: the first one is non-energetic
criteria. In other words, we aim at optimising functionals of the form
$\mathcal J(\beta)=\int_{\Omega\text{ or }\partial \Omega}j(u_\beta)$. We prove
that, depending on the monotonicity of the function $j$, the optimisers may be
of \emph{bang-bang} type (in other words, the optimisers write $1_\Gamma$ for
some measurable subset $\Gamma$ of $\partial \ Omega $) or, on the contrary,
that they may only take values strictly between 0 and 1. This has consequence
for a related shape optimisation problem, in which one tries to find where on
the boundary Neumann ($\partial_\nu u=0$ ) and constant Robin conditions
($\partial_\nu u+u=0$) should be placed in order to optimise criteria. The
proofs for this first case rely on new fine oscillatory techniques, used in
combination with optimality conditions. We then investigate the case of
compliance-type functionals. For such energetic functionals, we give an
in-depth analysis and even some explicit characterisation of optimal $\beta^*$.

necessary step toward demystifying the effectiveness of these models. In
particular, how do data from different classes gradually become separable in
their feature spaces when training neural networks using stochastic gradient
descent? In this study, we model the evolution of features during deep learning
training using a set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that each
corresponds to a training sample. As a crucial ingredient in our modeling
strategy, each SDE contains a drift term that reflects the impact of
backpropagation at an input on the features of all samples. Our main finding
uncovers a sharp phase transition phenomenon regarding the {intra-class impact:
if the SDEs are locally elastic in the sense that the impact is more
significant on samples from the same class as the input, the features of the
training data become linearly separable, meaning vanishing training loss;
otherwise, the features are not separable, regardless of how long the training
time is. Moreover, in the presence of local elasticity, an analysis of our SDEs
shows that the emergence of a simple geometric structure called the neural
collapse of the features. Taken together, our results shed light on the
decisive role of local elasticity in the training dynamics of neural networks.
We corroborate our theoretical analysis with experiments on a synthesized
dataset of geometric shapes and CIFAR-10.

we propose an end-to-end narrow-band network that directly takes as input the

signals of this frequency. In narrow-band, the spatial information (or
inter-channel difference) can well discriminate between speakers at different
positions. This information is intensively used in many narrow-band speech
separation methods, such as beamforming and clustering of spatial vectors. The
proposed network is trained to learn a rule to automatically exploit this
information and perform speech separation. Such a rule should be valid for any
frequency, thence the network is shared by all frequencies. In addition, a
full-band permutation invariant training criterion is proposed to solve the
frequency permutation problem encountered by most narrow-band methods.
Experiments show that, by focusing on deeply learning the narrow-band
information, the proposed method outperforms the oracle beamforming method and
the state-of-the-art deep learning based method.

character error rate (CER), which is one of the metric to evaluate the ASR
system and generally non-differentiable, our method uses two DNNs: one for
speech processing and one for mimicking the output CERs derived through an
acoustic model (AM). Then both of DNNs are alternately optimized in the
training phase. Even if the AM is a black-box, e.g., like one provided by a
third-party, the proposed method enables the DNN-based SE model to be optimized
in terms of the CER since the DNN mimicking the AM is differentiable.
Consequently, it becomes feasible to build CER-centric SE model that has no
negative effect, e.g., additional calculation cost and changing network
architecture, on the inference phase since our method is merely a training
scheme for the existing DNN-based methods. Experimental results show that our
method improved CER by 8.8% relative derived through a black-box AM although

states in the system. These LIOMs can be defined for any strength of the
interactions and disorder, and are of compact-support instead of
exponentially-decaying tail. Hence, even under the presence of interactions,
integrability is held, and all energy eigenstates are labeled by these LIOMs

occur. The compact-support nature of the LIOMs crucially prevents the
thermalization and entanglement spreading. We numerically investigate dynamics
of the system governed by the existence of the compact-support LIOMs, and
clarify the effects of additional interactions, which break the compact-support

misdiagnosis in borderline cases. In this study, we propose a framework for
automated early melanoma diagnosis using sequential dermoscopic images. To this
end, we construct our method in three steps. First, we align sequential
dermoscopic images of skin lesions using estimated Euclidean transformations,
extract the lesion growth region by computing image differences among the
consecutive images, and then propose a spatio-temporal network to capture the
dermoscopic changes from aligned lesion images and the corresponding difference
images. Finally, we develop an early diagnosis module to compute probability
scores of malignancy for lesion images over time. We collected 179 serial
dermoscopic imaging data from 122 patients to verify our method. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed model outperforms other commonly used
sequence models. We also compared the diagnostic results of our model with
those of seven experienced dermatologists and five registrars. Our model
achieved higher diagnostic accuracy than clinicians (63.69% vs. 54.33%,
respectively) and provided an earlier diagnosis of melanoma (60.7% vs. 32.7% of
melanoma correctly diagnosed on the first follow-up images). These results
demonstrate that our model can be used to identify melanocytic lesions that are

the datasets used in the network security field. The fact is that many of the
available public labeled datasets represent the network behavior just for a
particular time period. Given the rate of change in malicious behavior and the
serious challenge to label, and maintain these datasets, they become quickly
obsolete. Therefore, this work is focused on the analysis of current labeling
methodologies applied to network-based data. In the field of network security,
the process of labeling a representative network traffic dataset is
particularly challenging and costly since very specialized knowledge is
required to classify network traces. Consequently, most of the current traffic
labeling methods are based on the automatic generation of synthetic network
traces, which hides many of the essential aspects necessary for a correct
differentiation between normal and malicious behavior. Alternatively, a few
other methods incorporate non-experts users in the labeling process of real
traffic with the help of visual and statistical tools. However, after
conducting an in-depth analysis, it seems that all current methods for labeling
suffer from fundamental drawbacks regarding the quality, volume, and speed of
the resulting dataset. This lack of consistent methods for continuously
generating a representative dataset with an accurate and validated methodology
must be addressed by the network security research community. Moreover, a
consistent label methodology is a fundamental condition for helping in the
acceptance of novel detection approaches based on statistical and machine
learning techniques.

upon these studies by: 1) initialising the zero-age binary properties based on
realistic, metallicity-dependent star-formation history in the Milky Way (MW),
2) evolving these binaries to current epoch to generate realistic MW
populations of BH-LC binaries, 3) distributing these binaries in the MW
preserving the complex age-metallicity-Galactic position correlations, 4)
accounting for extinction and reddening using three-dimensional dust maps, 5)
examining the extended Gaia mission's ability to resolve BH-LC binaries. We
restrict ourselves to detached BH-LC binaries with orbital period <10 yr such
that Gaia can observe at least one full orbit. We find: 1) the extended Gaia
mission can astrometrically resolve 30-300 detached BH-LC binaries depending on
our assumptions of supernova physics and astrometric detection threshold; 2)
Gaia's astrometry alone can indicate BH candidates for 10-100 BH-LC binaries by
constraining the dark primary mass >3 Msun; 3) distributions of observables
including orbital periods, eccentricities, and component masses are sensitive
to the adopted binary evolution model, hence can directly inform binary
evolution models. Finally, we comment on the potential to further characterise
these BH binaries through radial velocity measurements and observation of X-ray
counterparts.

local flexibility markets. These markets are becoming increasingly important
for distribution system operators (DSOs) to ensure grid safety while minimizing
costs and public opposition to new network investments. Despite extended recent
literature on local flexibility markets, little attention has been paid to
quantifying the flexibility required at each location, considering physical
network constraints (e.g. line and voltage limits). The method introduced uses
a chance-constrained optimization model and a LinDistFlow approximation to
consider both physical network constraints and uncertainty caused by renewable
production or demand fluctuations. Unlike other methods, it avoids sharing
sensitive grid data with the market operator. We compare our approach against a
stochastic market-clearing mechanism which serves as a benchmark, and we derive
analytical conditions for the performance of our method to determine
flexibility requests. We show on two case studies that our method outperforms
the stochastic market-clearing benchmark in terms of computation time while
achieving comparable social welfare and costs for the DSOs. One of the case
studies is conducted on an actual German distribution grid, showing that the
proposed method can scale well to real-sized networks.

numbers N with imposed total strain amplitude $\Delta\varepsilon^t$, two main
types of behaviour are found depending on N and $\Delta\varepsilon^t$. This
allows a map of microstructures versus the number of cycles N and
$\Delta\varepsilon^t$ to be constructed. A domain called A presents anisotropic
microstructures due either to a partition of the plasticity throughout the k
channels, or to an oriented coarsening of the k% precipitates of the so-called
type N (rafts perpendicular to the loading axis). The domain called H shows
homogeneous deformation microstructures. The coarsening observed in repeated
fatigue is accounted for on the basis of a model proposed earlier in the
literature by V\'eron. Alternate fatigue (R$_\varepsilon$ = -1) also leads to
the same type of coarsening, even for a very low number of cycles (N=113). The
microstructures observed are ascribed to internal stress effects and are
related to the possible shearing of the precipitates and to different diffusion
processes.

  Communications Society",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  A novel OFDM-based waveform with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and
high robustness against phase noise (PN) is presented. It follows the discrete
Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(DFT-s-OFDM) signal model. 3MSK, is inspired by continuous-phase frequency
shift keying (FSK), but it uses three frequencies in the baseband model --
specifically, 0 and $\pm f_{symbol}/4$, where $f_{symbol}$ is the symbol rate
-- which effectively constrains the phase transitions between consecutive
symbols to 0 and $\pm \pi/2$ rad. Motivated by the phase controlled model of
modulation, different degrees of phase continuity can be achieved, while
supporting receiver processing with low complexity. The signal characteristics
are improved by generating an initial time-domain nearly constant envelope
signal at higher than the symbol rate. This helps to reach smooth phase
transitions between 3MSK symbols. Also the possibility of using excess
bandwidth is investigated by transmitting additional non-zero subcarriers
outside active subcarriers of the basic DFT-s-OFDM model, which provides the
capability to greatly reduce the PAPR. Due to the fact that the information is
encoded in the phase transitions, a receiver model that tracks the phase
variations without needing reference signals is developed. To this end, it is
shown that this new modulation is well-suited for non-coherent receivers, even
under strong phase noise (PN) conditions, thus allowing to reduce the overhead
of reference signals. Evaluations of this physical-layer modulation and
waveform scheme are performed in terms of transmitter metrics such as PAPR, OOB
emissions and achievable output power after the power amplifier (PA). Finally,
coded radio link evaluations are also shown and provided, demonstrating that
3MSK has a similar BER performance as that of traditional QPSK.

increasing number of nodes and edges and develop the theory of evolutionary
dynamics on sequential temporal networks. We derive explicit conditions under
which sequential temporal networks promote the evolution of cooperation
relative to their static counterparts. In particular, even if natural selection
disfavours cooperative behaviours on static networks, sequential temporal
networks can surprisingly rescue cooperation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
empirically that sequential temporal networks assembled from synthetic and

results advance the study of evolutionary dynamics on temporal networks and
open the avenue for investigating the evolution of prosocial and other

polynomial tetrahedron maps on the space of square matrices of arbitrary size,
using a matrix refactorisation equation, which does not coincide with the
standard local Yang--Baxter equation. Liouville integrability is established
for some of these maps.
  Also, we show how to derive linear tetrahedron maps as linear approximations
of nonlinear ones, using Lax representations and the differentials of nonlinear
tetrahedron maps on manifolds. We apply this construction to two nonlinear
maps: a tetrahedron map obtained in [arXiv:1708.05694] in a study of soliton
solutions of vector KP equations and a tetrahedron map obtained in
[arXiv:2005.13574] in a study of a matrix trifactorisation problem related to a
Darboux matrix associated with a Lax operator for the NLS equation. We derive
parametric families of new linear tetrahedron maps (with nonlinear dependence
on parameters), which are linear approximations for these nonlinear ones.
  Furthermore, we present (nonlinear) matrix generalisations of a tetrahedron
map from Sergeev's classification [arXiv:solv-int/9709006]. These matrix
generalisations can be regarded as tetrahedron maps in noncommutative
variables.
  Besides, several tetrahedron maps on arbitrary groups are constructed.

chromospheric activity data and six epochs of spectropolarimetric observations.
The chromospheric activity was determined by measuring the flux in the Ca II H
and K lines. A generalised Lomb-Scargle periodogram and a wavelet decomposition
were used on the chromospheric activity data to establish the associated
periodicities. The vector magnetic field of the star was reconstructed using
the technique of Zeeman Doppler imaging on the spectropolarimetric
observations. Our period analysis algorithms detect a 3.1 year chromospheric
cycle in addition to the star's well-known ~6 year cycle period. Although the
two cycle periods have an approximate 1:2 ratio, they exhibit an unusual
temporal evolution. Additionally, the spectropolarimetric data analysis shows
polarity reversals of the star's large-scale magnetic field, suggesting a ~10
year magnetic or Hale cycle. The unusual evolution of the star's chromospheric
cycles and their lack of a direct correlation with the magnetic cycle
establishes kappa Ceti as a curious young Sun. Such complex evolution of
magnetic activity could be synonymous with moderately active young Suns, which
is an evolutionary path that our own Sun could have taken.

data structure, a message-issuing node can decide where to append that message
and, consequently, how to grow the DAG. This DAG data structure can typically
be decomposed into two pools of messages: referenced messages and unreferenced
messages (tips). The selection of the parent messages to which a node appends
the messages it issues, depends on which messages it considers as tips.
However, the exact time that a message enters the tip pool of a node depends on
the delay of that message. In previous works, it was considered that messages
have the same or similar delay; however, this generally may not be the case. We
introduce the concept of classes of delays, where messages belonging to a
certain class have a specific delay, and where these classes coexist in the
DAG. We provide a general model that predicts the tip pool size for any finite
number of different classes.
  This categorisation and model is applied to the first iteration of the IOTA
2.0 protocol (a.k.a. Coordicide), where two distinct classes, namely value and
data messages, coexist. We show that the tip pool size depends strongly on the
dominating class that is present. Finally, we provide a methodology for
controlling the tip pool size by dynamically adjusting the number of references
a message creates.

applications of deep learning, where a model is pre-trained on a upstream large
dataset (e.g. ImageNet), and is then fine-tuned to different downstream tasks.
Though for most cases, the pre-training stage is conducted based on supervised
methods, recent works on self-supervised pre-training have shown powerful
transferability and even outperform supervised pre-training on multiple
downstream tasks. It thus remains an open question how to better generalize
supervised pre-training model to downstream tasks. In this paper, we argue that
the worse transferability of existing supervised pre-training methods arise
from the negligence of valuable intra-class semantic difference. This is
because these methods tend to push images from the same class close to each
other despite of the large diversity in their visual contents, a problem to
which referred as ""overfit of upstream tasks"". To alleviate this problem, we
propose a new supervised pre-training method based on Leave-One-Out
K-Nearest-Neighbor, or LOOK for short. It relieves the problem of overfitting
upstream tasks by only requiring each image to share its class label with most
of its k nearest neighbors, thus allowing each class to exhibit a multi-mode
distribution and consequentially preserving part of intra-class difference for
better transferring to downstream tasks. We developed efficient implementation
of the proposed method that scales well to large datasets. Experimental studies
on multiple downstream tasks show that LOOK outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods for supervised and self-supervised pre-training.

paradigm that automatically searches for models tailored to given tasks, which
greatly simplifies the development of ML systems and propels the trend of ML
democratization. Yet, little is known about the potential security risks
incurred by NAS, which is concerning given the increasing use of NAS-generated
models in critical domains.
  This work represents a solid initial step towards bridging the gap. Through
an extensive empirical study of 10 popular NAS methods, we show that compared
with their manually designed counterparts, NAS-generated models tend to suffer
greater vulnerability to various malicious attacks (e.g., adversarial evasion,
model poisoning, and functionality stealing). Further, with both empirical and
analytical evidence, we provide possible explanations for such phenomena: given
the prohibitive search space and training cost, most NAS methods favor models
that converge fast at early training stages; this preference results in
architectural properties associated with attack vulnerability (e.g., high loss
smoothness and low gradient variance). Our findings not only reveal the
relationships between model characteristics and attack vulnerability but also
suggest the inherent connections underlying different attacks. Finally, we
discuss potential remedies to mitigate such drawbacks, including increasing
cell depth and suppressing skip connects, which lead to several promising
research directions.

  arXiv:2107.12248",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The question whether inputs are valid for the problem a neural network is
trying to solve has sparked interest in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. It
is widely assumed that Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are well suited for this
task, as the endowed epistemic uncertainty should lead to disagreement in
predictions on outliers. In this paper, we question this assumption and show
that proper Bayesian inference with function space priors induced by neural
networks does not necessarily lead to good OOD detection. To circumvent the use
of approximate inference, we start by studying the infinite-width case, where
Bayesian inference can be exact due to the correspondence with Gaussian
processes. Strikingly, the kernels derived from common architectural choices
lead to function space priors which induce predictive uncertainties that do not
reflect the underlying input data distribution and are therefore unsuited for
OOD detection. Importantly, we find the OOD behavior in this limiting case to
be consistent with the corresponding finite-width case. To overcome this
limitation, useful function space properties can also be encoded in the prior
in weight space, however, this can currently only be applied to a specified
subset of the domain and thus does not inherently extend to OOD data. Finally,
we argue that a trade-off between generalization and OOD capabilities might
render the application of BNNs for OOD detection undesirable in practice.
Overall, our study discloses fundamental problems when naively using BNNs for
OOD detection and opens interesting avenues for future research.

We propose embedded-model flows (EMF), which alternate general-purpose
transformations with structured layers that embed domain-specific inductive
biases. These layers are automatically constructed by converting user-specified
differentiable probabilistic models into equivalent bijective transformations.
We also introduce gated structured layers, which allow bypassing the parts of
the models that fail to capture the statistics of the data. We demonstrate that
EMFs can be used to induce desirable properties such as multimodality,
hierarchical coupling and continuity. Furthermore, we show that EMFs enable a
high performance form of variational inference where the structure of the prior
model is embedded in the variational architecture. In our experiments, we show
that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in common structured

a specific technique called time-delay interferometry (TDI), which relies on
the measurements of time-delays between spacecraft and careful modeling of how
laser noise enters the interferometric data. Recently, this technique has been
recast into a matrix-based formalism by several authors, offering a different
perspective on TDI, particularly by relating it to principal component analysis

directly applying PCA to a set of shifted data samples, without any prior

time-delays. We show that this fully data-driven algorithm achieves a
gravitational-wave sensitivity similar to classic TDI.

framework adapts by sharing a global word embedding matrix across the clients,
with each client running its local model with Non-IID data. We collected the

FedPB can attain a competitive performance with a centralized phishing

that can model non-flat RCs at large radii. We discover that within the radial
coverage of the MaNGA data, the popularly known flat rotation curve at large
radii applies only to the particular classes of galaxies, i.e., massive late
types ($T$-type $\geq1$, $M_\mathrm{star}\gtrsim10^{10.8}M_\odot$) and S0 types
($T$-type$=-1$ or $0$, $M_\mathrm{star}\gtrsim10^{10.0}M_\odot$). The RC of
late-type galaxies at large radii rises more steeply as $M_\mathrm{star}$
decreases, and its slope increases to about $+9$ km s$^{-1}$kpc$^{-1}$ at
$M_\mathrm{star}\approx10^{9.7}M_\odot$. By contrast, elliptical galaxies
($T$-type $\le-2$) have descending RCs at large radii. Their slope becomes more
negative as $M_\mathrm{star}$ decreases, and reaches as negative as $-15$ km
s$^{-1}$kpc$^{-1}$ at $M_\mathrm{star}\approx10^{10.2}M_\odot$. We also find
that the inner slope of the RC is highest for elliptical galaxies with
$M_\mathrm{star}\approx10^{10.5}M_\odot$, and decreases as $T$-type increases

turnover radius $R_t$ is higher for higher $M_\mathrm{star}$, and $R_t$ is
larger for higher $M_\mathrm{star}$ and later $T$-types. We show that the inner
slope of the RC is coupled with the central surface stellar mass density, which
implies that the gravitational potential of central regions of galaxies is
dominated by baryonic matter. With the aid of simple models for matter

with unoccupied natural orbitals to perform many-electron perturbation theory
calculations of local fragments. The fragments are comprised of a set of

model contains more than 100 atoms in the simulation cell, the employed
fragments are small enough to allow for calculations using high-level theories
up to the coupled cluster ansatz with single, double and perturbative triple
particle-hole excitation operators (CCSD(T)). To correct for the missing
long-range correlation energy contributions to the adsorption energy, we embed
CCSD(T) theory into the direct random phase approximation, yielding rapidly
convergent adsorption energies with respect to the fragment size. Convergence
of computed binding energies with respect to the virtual orbital basis set is
achieved employing a number of recently developed techniques. Moreover, we

paper, we compute the bispectrum in the EEFToI, take a closer look at the
strong coupling constraints and calculate the size of the non-Gaussianities in
those regions of parameter space. We also investigate the shape of triangles
that contribute to the enhancement of non-Gaussianities in this regime. We find
that there are allowed parts of parameter spaces where EEFToI description with

equation of state of neutron stars are unkown, and assessing the detectability
of continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars suffers from these

reconstruct the early dynamical evolution of the solar system and to identify

iron isotopic data of 23 iron meteorites from nine major chemical groups we
show that all iron meteorites show the same fundamental dichotomy between
non-carbonaceous (NC) and a carbonaceous (CC) meteorites previously observed
for other elements. The Fe isotopic anomalies are predominantly produced by
variation in 54Fe, where all CC iron meteorites are characterized by an excess
in 54Fe relative to NC iron meteorites. This excess in 54Fe is accompanied by
an excess in 58Ni observed in the same CC meteorite groups. Together, these
overabundances of 54Fe and 58Ni are produced by nuclear statistical equilibrium
either in type Ia supernovae or in the Si/S shell of core-collapse supernovae.
The new Fe isotopic data reveal that Earth's mantle plots on or close to
correlations defined by Fe, Mo, and Ru isotopic anomalies in iron meteorites,
indicating that throughout Earth's accretion, the isotopic composition of its
building blocks did not drastically change. While Earth's mantle has a similar
Fe isotopic composition to CI chondrites, the latter are clearly distinct from
Earth's mantle for other elements (e.g., Cr and Ni) whose delivery to Earth
coincided with Fe. The fact that CI chondrites exhibit large Cr and Ni isotopic
anomalies relative to Earth's mantle, therefore, demonstrates that CI
chondrites are unlikely to have contributed significant Fe to Earth.

the speed requirements because of too many raw points, and the voxel-based

In contrast, the 2D grid-based methods, such as PointPillar, can easily achieve
a stable and efficient speed based on simple 2D convolution, but it is hard to
get the competitive accuracy limited by the coarse-grained point clouds
representation. So we propose an improved pillar with fine-grained feature
based on PointPillar that can significantly improve detection accuracy. It
consists of two modules, including height-aware sub-pillar and sparsity-based
tiny-pillar, which get fine-grained representation respectively in the vertical

a height position encoding to keep height information of each sub-pillar during
projecting to a 2D pseudo image. For sparsity-based tiny-pillar, we introduce

when the underlying data distribution is different from that in the training
set. By learning minimum sufficient representations from training data, the
information bottleneck (IB) approach has demonstrated its effectiveness to
improve generalization in different AI applications. In this work, we propose a
new neural network-based IB approach, termed gated information bottleneck
(GIB), that dynamically drops spurious correlations and progressively selects
the most task-relevant features across different environments by a trainable
soft mask (on raw features). GIB enjoys a simple and tractable objective,
without any variational approximation or distributional assumption. We
empirically demonstrate the superiority of GIB over other popular neural
network-based IB approaches in adversarial robustness and out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection. Meanwhile, we also establish the connection between IB theory
and invariant causal representation learning, and observed that GIB
demonstrates appealing performance when different environments arrive
sequentially, a more practical scenario where invariant risk minimization (IRM)
fails. Code of GIB is available at https://github.com/falesiani/GIB

multivariate time series composed of various parameters of oil wells measured
during their exploitation. By tuning the machine learning models for a single
well (ignoring the effect of neighboring wells) on the open-source field
datasets, we demonstrate that transformer outperforms recurrent neural networks
with LSTM/GRU cells in the forecasting of the bottomhole pressure dynamics. We
apply the transfer learning procedure to the transformer-based surrogate model,
which includes the initial training on the dataset from a certain well and
additional tuning of the model's weights on the dataset from a target well.
Transfer learning approach helps to improve the prediction capability of the
model. Next, we generalize the single-well model based on the transformer
architecture for multiple wells to simulate complex transient oilfield-level
patterns. In other words, we create the global model which deals with the
dataset, comprised of the production history from multiple wells, and allows
for capturing the well interference resulting in more accurate prediction of
the bottomhole pressure or flow rate evolutions for each well under
consideration. The developed instruments for a single-well and oilfield-scale

operating regime and submersible equipment to increase the hydrocarbon

observed a large area of the inner Galaxy in the $^{13}$CO(2-1) line at an

considering the features of the molecular gas emission as a whole across the
longitude-velocity map built from the full survey. Additionally, we examine the
properties of the molecular clouds in the spiral arms compared to the
properties of their counterparts in the inter-arm regions. Through flux and
luminosity probability distribution functions, we find that the molecular gas
emission associated with the spiral arms does not differ significantly from the
emission between the arms. On average, spiral arms show masses per unit length
of $\sim10^5-10^6$ M$_{\odot} $kpc$^{-1}$. This is similar to values inferred
from data sets in which emission distributions were segmented into molecular
clouds. By examining the cloud distribution across the Galactic plane, we infer
that the molecular mass in the spiral arms is a factor of 1.5 higher than that
of the inter-arm medium, similar to what is found for other spiral galaxies in
the local Universe. We observe that only the distributions of cloud mass
surface densities and aspect ratio in the spiral arms show significant
differences compared to those of the inter-arm medium; other observed
differences appear instead to be driven by a distance bias. By comparing our
results with simulations and observations of nearby galaxies, we conclude that
the measured quantities would classify the Milky Way as a flocculent spiral
galaxy, rather than as a grand-design one.

the main idea is to approximate a transfer function by ensuring that the
interpolation conditions imposed by moment matching are satisfied in a least
squares sense. The paper revisits this idea using tools from output regulation
theory to provide a new time-domain characterization of least squares moment
matching. It is shown that least squares moment matching can be characterized
in terms of an optimization problem involving an invariance equation and in
terms of the steady-state behavior of an error system. This characterization,
in turn, is then used to define a nonlinear enhancement of the notion of least
squares moment matching and to develop a model reduction theory for nonlinear
systems based on the notion of least squares moment matching. Parameterized
families of models achieving least squares moment matching are determined both
for linear and nonlinear systems. The new parameterizations are shown to admit
natural geometric and system-theoretic interpretations. The theory is

gate-times are typically longer than conventional dynamical gates, resulting in
weakening of robustness and more infidelities of the implemented geometric

computation on superconducting transmon qubits, where high-fidelity and robust
universal nonadiabatic geometric gates can be implemented, based on

appropriate evolution paths, the constructed geometric gates can be superior to
their corresponding dynamical ones under different local errors. Numerical
simulations show that the fidelities for single-qubit geometric Phase, $\pi/8$

respectively. Remarkably, the fidelity for two-qubit control-phase gate can be
as high as $99.87\%$. Therefore, our scheme provides a new perspective for

faster algorithm for learning a discretized approximation of the latent

graph ensembles, a simple forward greedy search algorithm (i.e. without a
backward pruning phase) suffices to learn the Markov boundary of each node.
This substantially improves the sample complexity, which we show is at most
polynomial in the number of nodes. This is then applied to learn the entire

conditions from the literature. As a matter of independent interest, we
establish finite-sample guarantees for the problem of recovering Markov
boundaries from data. Moreover, we apply our results to the special case of
polytrees, for which the assumptions simplify, and provide explicit conditions
under which polytrees are identifiable and learnable in polynomial time. We
further illustrate the performance of the algorithm, which is easy to
implement, in a simulation study. Our approach is general, works for discrete

modern intelligent systems. To solve this problem and image segmentation,
conditional random fields (CRFs) are usually formulated as discrete models in
label space to encourage label consistency, which is actually a kind of
postprocessing. In this paper, we reconsider the CRF in feature space for point
cloud segmentation because it can capture the structure of features well to
improve the representation ability of features rather than simply smoothing.
Therefore, we first model the point cloud features with a continuous quadratic
energy model and formulate its solution process as a message-passing graph
convolution, by which it can be easily integrated into a deep network. We
theoretically demonstrate that the message passing in the graph convolution is
equivalent to the mean-field approximation of a continuous CRF model.
Furthermore, we build an encoder-decoder network based on the proposed
continuous CRF graph convolution (CRFConv), in which the CRFConv embedded in
the decoding layers can restore the details of high-level features that were
lost in the encoding stage to enhance the location ability of the network,
thereby benefiting segmentation. Analogous to the CRFConv, we show that the
classical discrete CRF can also work collaboratively with the proposed network
via another graph convolution to further improve the segmentation results.
Experiments on various point cloud benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed method. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods,
the proposed method can also achieve competitive segmentation performance.

of the physiological state dynamics. Results demonstrate that state dynamics
corresponding to the missing ODEs can be approximated well using a neural
network trained using a recursive Bayesian filtering approach in a fashion
coupled with the known state dynamic differential equations. This demonstrates
that dynamics and impact of missing state variables can be captured through
joint state estimation and model parameter estimation within a recursive
Bayesian state estimation (RBSE) framework. Results also indicate that this
RBSE approach to training the NN parameters yields better outcomes
(measurement/state estimation accuracy) than training the neural network with
backpropagation through time in the same setting.

the nuclear shell model have reached sizes of $10^9 - 10^{10}$ basis states,

can, in principle, solve such systems exactly with exponentially fewer

many qubits and large gate depth, but variational approaches can effectively
limit the required gate depth.
  We use the unitary coupled cluster approach to construct approximations of
the ground-state vectors, later to be used in dynamics calculations. The
testing ground is the phenomenological shell model space, which allows us to
mimic the complexity of the inter-nucleon interactions. We find that often one
needs to minimize over a large number of parameters, using a large number of
entanglements that makes challenging the application on existing hardware.
Prospects for rapid improvements with more capable hardware are, however, very

typical particle nature of a photon, the quantum feature of photon bunching on
a beam splitter between two output photons can be explained by Born rule even
without clear definition of the relative phase between two input photons.
Unlike conventional understanding on this matter, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel
effect, here, we present a new interpretation based on the wave nature of a
photon, where the quantum feature of photon bunching is explained through phase
basis superposition of the beam splitter. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer is
additionally presented to support the correctness of the presented method. As a
result, our limited understanding of the quantum feature is deepened via phase
basis superposition regarding the destructive quantum interference. Thus, the
so-called mysterious quantum feature is now clarified by both the definite
phase relationship between paired photons and a new term of the phase basis
superposition of an optical system.

However, they have ignored semantic information that could help the AAC model

automated audio captioning based on incorporating semantic and acoustic

sub-modules. (1) The pre-trained keyword encoder utilizes pre-trained ResNet38
to initialize its parameters, and then it is trained by extracted keywords as

number of wavelengths) to achieve higher aggregated datarate in photonic links,
and hence higher throughput in PNoCs, requires sophisticated and costly laser
sources along with extra photonic hardware. This extra hardware can introduce
undesired noise to the photonic link and increase the bit-error-rate (BER),

4-pulse amplitude modulation (4-PAM) signaling, instead of the conventional
on-off keying (OOK) signaling, can halve the wavelength signals utilized in
photonic links for achieving the target aggregate datarate while reducing the
overhead of crosstalk noise, BER, and photonic hardware. There are various
designs of 4- PAM modulators reported in the literature. For example, the
signal superposition (SS), electrical digital-to-analog converter (EDAC), and
optical digital-to-analog converter (ODAC) based designs of 4-PAM modulators

and amplitudes by fitting a Hermite polynomial expansion. For the shape
parameter of the Minkowski functional curves $a_0$, that is related to the

changes the fabric thickness and ultimately fibre volume fraction of

compaction behaviour during composite forming to study the thickness changes of

different orientations of the fabric plies (00/00 and 00/900). Nesting of the
layers has been calculated for single plies and for multi-layer stacks of dry

the preform plays a vital role in determining the thickness of the preform. The
compressibility pattern of these various structures was also dissimilar for
single layer and multi-layer stack which was attributed to the different
nesting behaviours of these flax fibre structures.

experimentally study the solvent exchange process by injecting mixtures of

upward direction. Locally, turbulent mixing causes oversaturation of the
trans-anethole following turbulent entrainment. We optically measure the
concentration of the nucleated droplets using a light attenuation technique and
find that the radial concentration profile is sub-Gaussian. In contrast to the
entrainment-based models, the spatial evolution of the oversaturation reveals
continuous droplet nucleation downstream and radially across the jet, which we
attribute to the limited mixing capacity of the jet. Though we are far from a

interpretation depending upon context and the requirements of a specific
community. The focus of this work is to formulate this concept for a general
class of passive oscillatory dynamical systems, including but not limited to
mechanical, structural, acoustic, electrical, and optical. Typically, the
bandwidth of these systems is determined by the half-power (-3 dB) method, and
the result is often referred to as half-power bandwidth. The fundamental
assumption underlying this definition is that the system performance degrades
once its power decreases by 50%; moreover, there are restrictive conditions
that are rarely met. Here the concept of root mean square bandwidth is
considered, justified by the Fourier uncertainty principle, to generalize the
definition of bandwidth to encompass linear and nonlinear, single and
multi-mode, low and high loss and time-varying and invariant oscillating
systems. By tying the bandwidth of an oscillatory dynamical system directly to
its dissipative capacity, one can formulate a definition based solely on its
transient energy evolution, effectively circumventing the previous
restrictions. Further, applications are given that highlight the limitations of
the traditional half-power bandwidth; including a Duffing oscillator with
hardening nonlinearity, and a geometrically nonlinear oscillator with tunable
hardening or softening nonlinearity. The resulting energy-dependent bandwidth
computations are compatible with the nonlinear dynamics of these systems, since
at low energies they recover the half-power bandwidth, whereas at high energies
they accurately capture the nonlinear physics. Moreover, the bandwidth
computation is directly tied to nonlinear harmonic generation in the transient
dynamics.

livable, sustainable, safe communities. Inspired by image generation, deep
urban planning aims to leverage deep learning to generate land-use
configurations. However, urban planning is a complex process. Existing studies
usually ignore the need of personalized human guidance in planning, and spatial
hierarchical structure in planning generation. Moreover, the lack of
large-scale land-use configuration samples poses a data sparsity challenge.
This paper studies a novel deep human guided urban planning method to jointly
solve the above challenges. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a deep
conditional variational autoencoder based framework. In this framework, we
exploit the deep encoder-decoder design to generate land-use configurations. To
capture the spatial hierarchy structure of land uses, we enforce the decoder to
generate both the coarse-grained layer of functional zones, and the
fine-grained layer of POI distributions. To integrate human guidance, we allow
humans to describe what they need as texts and use these texts as a model
condition input. To mitigate training data sparsity and improve model
robustness, we introduce a variational Gaussian embedding mechanism. It not
just allows us to better approximate the embedding space distribution of
training data and sample a larger population to overcome sparsity, but also
adds more probabilistic randomness into the urban planning generation to
improve embedding diversity so as to improve robustness. Finally, we present
extensive experiments to validate the enhanced performances of our method.

deformation of a neutron star, its Komar mass, and its circumferential radius
in the case of purely poloidal and purely toroidal magnetic configurations
satisfying the equilibrium criterion in the Bernoulli formalism. These
relations are quasi-universal, in the sense that they mostly do not depend on
the equation of state. Our results, being formulated in terms of potentially
observable quantities, could help to understand the magnetic properties of
neutron stars interiors and the detectability of continuous gravitational waves
by isolated neutron stars, independently of their equation of state. In the
case of scalar-tensor theories, these relations depend also on the scalar
charge of the neutron stars, thus potentially providing a new way to set
constraints on the theory of gravitation.

  Perceptual Network for Predicting Abnormal Connections of Alzheimer's Disease",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Alzheimer's disease is characterized by alterations of the brain's structural
and functional connectivity during its progressive degenerative processes.
Existing auxiliary diagnostic methods have accomplished the classification
task, but few of them can accurately evaluate the changing characteristics of
brain connectivity. In this work, a prior guided adversarial representation
learning and hypergraph perceptual network (PGARL-HPN) is proposed to predict
abnormal brain connections using triple-modality medical images. Concretely, a
prior distribution from the anatomical knowledge is estimated to guide
multimodal representation learning using an adversarial strategy. Also, the
pairwise collaborative discriminator structure is further utilized to narrow
the difference of representation distribution. Moreover, the hypergraph
perceptual network is developed to effectively fuse the learned representations
while establishing high-order relations within and between multimodal images.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other
related methods in analyzing and predicting Alzheimer's disease progression.
More importantly, the identified abnormal connections are partly consistent
with the previous neuroscience discoveries. The proposed model can evaluate
characteristics of abnormal brain connections at different stages of
Alzheimer's disease, which is helpful for cognitive disease study and early
treatment.

completed and on-going pilot projects, regulators are still reluctant to
implement peer-to-peer trading at a large-scale in today's electricity market.
The reason could partly be attributed to the perceived disadvantage of current
market participants like retailers due to their exclusion from market
participation - a fundamental property of decentralised peer-to-peer trading.
As a consequence, recently, there has been growing pressure from energy service
providers in favour of retailers' participation in peer-to-peer trading.
However, the role of retailers in the peer-to-peer market is yet to be
established as no existing study has challenged this fundamental circumspection
of decentralized trading. In this context, this perspective takes the first
step to discuss the feasibility of retailers' involvement in the peer-to-peer
market. In doing so, we identify key characteristics of retail-based and
peer-to-peer electricity markets and discuss our viewpoint on how to
incorporate a single retailer in a peer-to-peer market without compromising the
fundamental decision-making characteristics of both markets. Finally, we give
an example of a hypothetical business model to demonstrate how a retailer can
be a part of a peer-to-peer market with a promise of collective benefits for
the participants.

such aggregate flows are highly predictable (even though the paths of

elements, like eccentricity, which may significantly influence the evolution of

black holes. The standard approach found in the literature describes this
phenomenon in the framework of Hamiltonian mechanics. Here we derive the long

the dynamics using forces and torques instead of the usual Hamiltonian

polynomials with other classes of polynomials. An open question in the
literature is how to obtain similar results following the general form of
Putinar's Positivstellensatz. Extrapolating the algebraic geometry tools used
to obtain this type of result in the SOS case fails to answer this question,
because algebraic geometry methods strongly use hallmark properties of the
class of SOS polynomials, such as closure under multiplication and closure
under composition with other polynomials. In this article, using a new
approach, we show the existence of Putinar-type Positivstellens\""atze that are
constructed using non-SOS classes of non-negative polynomials, such as SONC,
SDSOS and DSOS polynomials. Even not necessarily non-negative classes of
polynomials such as sums of arithmetic-mean/geometric-mean polynomials could be
used. Furthermore, we show that these certificates can be written with inherent
sparsity characteristics. Such characteristics can be further exploited when
the sparsity structure of both the polynomial whose non-negativity is being
certified and the polynomials defining the semialgebraic set of interest are
known. In contrast with related literature focused on exploiting sparsity in
SOS Positivstellens\""atze, these latter results show how to exploit sparsity in

incorporate discretized governing equation residuals into the training of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is extended to two-phase porous media
flow problems in this work. The two principal variables of the considered
problem, pressure and saturation, are approximated simultaneously with two
CNNs, respectively. Pressure and saturation are coupled with each other in the
governing equations, and thus the two networks are also mutually conditioned in
the training process by the discretized governing equations, which also
increases the difficulty of model training. The coupled and discretized
equations can provide valuable information in the training process. With the
assistance of theory-guidance, the TgCNN surrogates can achieve better accuracy
than ordinary CNN surrogates in two-phase flow problems. Moreover, a piecewise
training strategy is proposed for the scenario with varying well controls, in
which the TgCNN surrogates are constructed for different segments on the time
dimension and stacked together to predict solutions for the whole time-span.
For scenarios with larger variance of the formation property field, the TgCNN
surrogates can also achieve satisfactory performance. The constructed TgCNN
surrogates are further used for inversion of permeability fields by combining
them with the iterative ensemble smoother (IES) algorithm, and sufficient
inversion accuracy is obtained with improved efficiency.

done to support vehicles that are currently covered and/or will be by each mBS.
We formulate the dynamic video delivery scheme that adaptively determines 1)
which content, 2) what quality and 3) how many chunks to be proactively

finally shows that the DRL agent learns a streaming policy that pursues high
