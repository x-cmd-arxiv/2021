with a rate equal to the hyperbolic volume.
  Since then, this conjecture has been proven or numerically tested for several
hyperbolic 3-manifolds, either closed or with boundary, the boundary being
either a family of tori or a family of higher genus surfaces. The current paper
now provides new numerical checks of this volume conjecture for 3-manifolds
with one toroidal boundary component and one geodesic boundary component.
  More precisely, we study a family of hyperbolic 3-manifolds $M_g$ introduced
by Frigerio. Each $M_g$ can be seen as the complement of a knot in an
handlebody of genus $g$.
  We provide an explicit code that computes the Turaev-Viro invariants of these
manifolds $M_g$, and we then numerically check the Chen-Yang volume conjecture
for the first six members of this family.
  Furthermore, we propose an extension of the volume conjecture, where the
second coefficient of the asymptotic expansion only depends on the topology of
the boundary of the manifold. We numerically check this property for the
manifolds $M_2$ to $M_7$ and we also observe that the second coefficient grows
linearly in the Euler characteristic $\chi(\partial M_g)$.

parametrization for the matter density profile. We constrain the underdensity
and the background cosmology with a combination of data sets: the Pantheon
Sample of type Ia supernovae (both the full catalogue and a redshift-binned
version of it), a collection of baryon acoustic oscillations data points and
the distance priors extracted from the latest Planck data release. The analysis
with the binned supernovae suggests a preference for a $-13 \%$ density drop
with a size of approximately 300 Mpc, interestingly matching the prediction for
the so-called KBC void already identified on the basis of independent analyses
using galaxy distributions. The constraints obtained with the full Pantheon
Sample are instead compatible with a homogeneous cosmology and we interpret
this radically different result as a cautionary tale about the potential bias
introduced by employing a binned supernova data set. We quantify the level of
improvement on the Hubble tension by analyzing the constraints on the B-band
absolute magnitude of the supernovae, which provides the calibration for the
local measurements of $H_0$. Since no significant difference is observed with
respect to an analogous fit performed with a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology,
we conclude that the potential presence of a local underdensity does not
resolve the tension and does not significantly degrade current supernova
constraints on $H_0$.

to stellar systems. However, most of the expected sulfur in molecular clouds
remains undetected. Sulfur disappears from the gas phase in two steps. One
first depletion occurs during the translucent phase, reducing the gas phase
sulfur by 7-40 times, while the following freeze-out step occurs in molecular
clouds, reducing it by another order of magnitude. This long-standing dilemma
awaits an explanation. Aims. The aim of this study is to understand under which
form the missing sulfur is hiding in molecular clouds. Depletion onto dust
grains is considered. Methods. Experimental simulations mimicking H2S ice
UV-photoprocessing in molecular clouds were conducted. The ice was monitored
using infrared spectroscopy and the desorbing molecules were measured by
quadrupole mass spectrometry. Theoretical Monte Carlo simulations were
performed for interpretation of the experimental results and extrapolation to
astrophysical conditions. Results. H2S2 formation was observed during
irradiation at 8 K. Molecules H2Sx with x > 2 were also identified and found to
desorb during warm-up, along with S2 to S4 species. Larger Sx molecules up to
S8 are refractory at room temperature and remained on the substrate forming a
residue. Monte Carlo simulations were able to reproduce the molecules desorbing
during warming up, and found that residues are chains or sulfur consisting of
6-7 atoms. Conclusions. We propose that S+ in translucent clouds contributes
notoriously to S depletion in denser regions by forming long S-chains on dust
in few times 10^4 years. We suggest that the S2 to S4 molecules observed in
comets are not produced by fragmentation of these large chains. Instead, they
probably come either from UV-photoprocessing of H2S-bearing ice produced in
molecular clouds or from short S chains formed during the translucent cloud
phase

stability, of the solutions to a class of nonlocal fully nonlinear parabolic
partial differential equations (PDEs), where there is an external time
parameter $t$ on top of the temporal and spatial variables $(s,y)$ and thus the
problem could be considered as a flow of equations. The nonlocality comes from
the dependence on the unknown function and its first- and second-order
derivatives evaluated at not only the local point $(t,s,y)$ but also at the
diagonal line of the time domain $(s,s,y)$. Such equations arise from
time-inconsistent problems in game theory or behavioural economics, where the
observations and preferences are (reference-)time-dependent. To address the
open problem of the well-posedness of the corresponding nonlocal PDEs (or the
time-inconsistent problems), we first study the linearized version of the
nonlocal PDEs with an innovative construction of appropriate norms and Banach
spaces and contraction mappings over which. With fixed-point arguments, we
obtain the well-posedness of nonlocal linear PDEs and establish a Schauder-type
prior estimate for the solutions. Then, by the linearization method, we
analogously establish the well-posedness under the fully nonlinear case.
Moreover, we reveal that the solution of a nonlocal fully nonlinear parabolic
PDE is an adapted solution to a flow of second-order forward-backward
stochastic differential equations.

sampling-based kinodynamic planners for vehicular navigation. It proposes a
learning framework for identifying promising controls during the expansion
process of sampling-based planners. Given a dynamics model, a reinforcement
learning process is trained offline to return a low-cost control that reaches a
local goal state (i.e., a waypoint) in the absence of obstacles. By focusing on
the system's dynamics and not knowing the environment, this process is
data-efficient and takes place once for a robotic system. In this way, it can
be reused in different environments. The planner generates online local goal
states for the learned controller in an informed manner to bias towards the
goal and consecutively in an exploratory, random manner. For the informed
expansion, local goal states are generated either via (a) medial axis
information in environments with obstacles, or (b) wavefront information for
setups with traversability costs. The learning process and the resulting
planning framework are evaluated for a first and second-order differential
drive system, as well as a physically simulated Segway robot. The results show
that the proposed integration of learning and planning can produce higher
quality paths than sampling-based kinodynamic planning with random controls in
fewer iterations and computation time.

mixed-layer instability is active, the surface geostrophic velocity is largely
induced by surface buoyancy anomalies. Yet, in these regions, the observed
surface kinetic energy spectrum is steeper than predicted by uniformly
stratified surface quasigeostrophic theory. By generalizing surface
quasigeostrophic theory to account for variable stratification, we show that
surface buoyancy anomalies can generate a variety of dynamical regimes
depending on the stratification's vertical structure. Buoyancy anomalies
generate longer range velocity fields over decreasing stratification and
shorter range velocity fields over increasing stratification. As a result, the
surface kinetic energy spectrum is steeper over decreasing stratification than
over increasing stratification. An exception occurs if the near surface
stratification is much larger than the deep ocean stratification. In this case,
we find an extremely local turbulent regime with surface buoyancy
homogenization and a steep surface kinetic energy spectrum, similar to
equivalent barotropic turbulence. By applying the variable stratification
theory to the wintertime North Atlantic, and assuming that mixed-layer
instability acts as a narrowband small-scale surface buoyancy forcing, we
obtain a predicted surface kinetic energy spectrum between $k^{-4/3}$ and
$k^{-7/3}$, which is consistent with the observed wintertime $k^{-2}$ spectrum.
We conclude by suggesting a method of measuring the buoyancy frequency's
vertical structure using satellite observations.

answer this question, we reveal the insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of
existing PNR detectors, and propose an alternative interpretation for the
analysis of PNR detector output that is consistent with a wave picture of light
and does not rely on the presumption of light particles. This interpretation is
based on the aggregation of correlated or accidentally coincident detections
within a given detector coincidence window. Our interpretation accounts for the
arbitrary character of detector coincidence windows and includes connections to
established treatments of intensity interferometers. To validate our
interpretation, we performed an experiment on a multiplexed PNR detector and
examined the dependence of photon number on the coincidence window via
post-processing. These observations were then compared to a fully classical
wave model based on amplitude threshold detection, and the results were found
to be in excellent agreement. We find that results from low SNR PNR detectors,
such as those existing in the literature, are able to be described by classical
descriptions, and therefore do not demonstrate evidence for the discrete nature
of light.

their long-time dynamical properties at a computational cost drastically

based on the reproduction of the dynamics of trajectories rather than the

other observables beyond these two, including e.g. stationary currents in
non-equilibrium situations, or the distribution of first passage times between

the conformal basis yields exactly the celestial OPEs in celestial CFT. We also
derive the celestial OPEs from the collinear factorization of string amplitudes
and the results derived in these two different methods are in perfect agreement
with each other. Our final formulae of celestial OPEs are applicable to general
dimensions, corresponding to Einstein-Yang-Mills theory supplemented by some
possible higher derivative interactions. Specializing to 4D, we reproduce all
the celestial OPEs for gluon and graviton in the literature. We consider
various string theories, including the open and closed bosonic string, as well
as the closed superstring theory with $\mathcal N=1$ and $\mathcal N=2$
worldsheet supersymmetry. In the case of $\mathcal N=2$ string, we also derive
all the $\overline{SL (2,\mathbb R)}$ descendant contributions in the celestial
OPE; the soft sector of such OPE just yields the $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra after
rewriting in terms of chiral modes. Our stringy derivation of celestial OPEs
thus initiates the first step towards the realization of celestial holography
in string theory.

result of past collisional events. Debris produced during such episodes in the
neighborhood of a host planet can evolve into co-orbitals trapped in
quasi-satellite and/or horseshoe resonant states. A recently announced centaur,
2013 VZ70, follows an orbit that could be compatible with those of prograde
Saturn's co-orbitals.
  Aims. We perform an exploration of the short-term dynamical evolution of 2013
VZ70 to confirm or reject a co-orbital relationship with Saturn. A possible
connection with Saturn's irregular moon population is also investigated.
  Methods. We studied the evolution of 2013 VZ70 backward and forward in time
using N-body simulations, factoring uncertainties into the calculations. We
computed the distribution of mutual nodal distances between this centaur and a
sample of moons.
  Results. We confirm that 2013 VZ70 is currently trapped in a horseshoe
resonant state with respect to Saturn but that it is a transient co-orbital. We
also find that 2013 VZ70 may become a quasi-satellite of Saturn in the future
and that it may experience brief periods of capture as a temporary irregular
moon. This centaur might also pass relatively close to known irregular moons of
Saturn.
  Conclusions. Although an origin in trans-Neptunian space is possible, the
hostile resonant environment characteristic of Saturn's neighborhood favors a
scenario of in situ formation via impact, fragmentation, or tidal disruption as
2013 VZ70 can experience encounters with Saturn at very low relative velocity.
An analysis of its orbit within the context of those of the moons of Saturn
suggests that 2013 VZ70 could be related to the Inuit group. Also, the mutual
nodal distances of 2013 VZ70 and the moons Fornjot and Thrymr are below the
first percentile of the distribution.

employed to make interpolations and extrapolations in that space. Through a
schematic nuclear-physics model with finite-range two and three-body
interactions, we demonstrate the emulators to be extremely accurate and
efficient. The computing time for emulation is on the scale of milliseconds (on
a laptop), with relative errors ranging from $10^{-13}$ to $10^{-4}$ depending
on the case. The emulators also require little memory. We argue that these
emulators can be generalized to even more challenging scattering problems.

of emulators in other fields, wherever variational methods can be developed for

investigate the behaviour of the pressure in the coupling region of the

interpolation is a Bayes point machine for Gaussian process classification.
This observation facilitates the transfer of results from both ensemble theory

PAC-Bayes risk bounds for kernel interpolation. Since large margin, infinite

to new tasks, but current RL methods require a large number of trials to
accomplish this. In this paper, we tackle rapid adaptation to new tasks through
the framework of meta-learning, which utilizes past tasks to learn to adapt
with a specific focus on industrial insertion tasks. Fast adaptation is crucial
because prohibitively large number of on-robot trials will potentially damage
hardware pieces. Additionally, effective adaptation is also feasible in that
experience among different insertion applications can be largely leveraged by
each other. In this setting, we address two specific challenges when applying
meta-learning. First, conventional meta-RL algorithms require lengthy online
meta-training. We show that this can be replaced with appropriately chosen
offline data, resulting in an offline meta-RL method that only requires
demonstrations and trials from each of the prior tasks, without the need to run
costly meta-RL procedures online. Second, meta-RL methods can fail to
generalize to new tasks that are too different from those seen at meta-training
time, which poses a particular challenge in industrial applications, where high
success rates are critical. We address this by combining contextual
meta-learning with direct online finetuning: if the new task is similar to
those seen in the prior data, then the contextual meta-learner adapts
immediately, and if it is too different, it gradually adapts through
finetuning. We show that our approach is able to quickly adapt to a variety of
different insertion tasks, with a success rate of 100% using only a fraction of
the samples needed for learning the tasks from scratch. Experiment videos and

strategy is easy to apply, and organizes speakers according to their positions

outperforms PIT, and distance-based training further improves the separation
performance when speaker azimuths are close. Furthermore, we dynamically select
azimuth-based or distance-based training by estimating the azimuths of
separated speakers, which further improves separation performance. LBT has a
linear training complexity with respect to the number of speakers, as opposed
to the factorial complexity of PIT. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of

galaxies with an AGN are indeed observed to reside in the so-called green

red quenched state. We use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to show that
such an interpretation requires substantial revision. Optically-selected nearby
AGN galaxies follow exponentially declining star formation histories, as normal
galaxies of similar stellar and dark matter halo mass, reaching in the recent
past ($\sim$0.1 Gyr ago) star formation rate levels consistent with a quiescent
population. However, we find that local AGN galaxies have experienced a sudden
increase in their star formation rate, unfolding on timescales similar to those
typical of AGN activity, suggesting that both star formation and AGN activity
were triggered simultaneously. We find that this quenching followed by an
enhancement in the star formation rate is common to AGN galaxies and more
pronounced in early type galaxies. Our results demonstrate that local AGN
galaxies are not just a simple transition type between star-forming and
quiescent galaxies as previously postulated.

low-luminosity Type Iax supernova. SN 2021fcg was discovered by the Zwicky
Transient Facility in the star-forming galaxy IC0512 at a distance of $\approx$
27 Mpc. It reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_{r} =$ $-12.66\pm0.20$ mag,
making it the least luminous thermonuclear supernova discovered to date. The
E(B-V) contribution from the underlying host galaxy is unconstrained. However,
even if it were as large as 0.5 mag, the peak absolute magnitude would be
$M_{r} = -13.78\pm0.20$ mag -- still consistent with being the lowest
luminosity SN. Optical spectra of SN 2021fcg taken at 37 and 65 days post
maximum show strong [Ca II], Ca II and Na I D emission and several weak [Fe II]
emission lines. The [Ca II] emission in the two spectra has extremely low
velocities of $\approx 1300$ and $1000$ km s$^{-1}$ respectively. The spectra
very closely resemble those of the very low luminosity Type Iax supernovae SN
2008ha, SN 2010ae and SN 2019gsc taken at similar phases. The peak bolometric
luminosity of SN 2021fcg is $\approx$ $2.5^{+1.5}_{-0.3}\times10^{40}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ which is a factor of three lower than that for SN 2008ha. The
bolometric lightcurve of SN 2021fcg is consistent with a very low ejected
nickel mass (M$_{\rm{Ni}} \approx 0.8^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$).
The low luminosity and nickel mass of SN 2021fcg pose a challenge to the
picture that low luminosity SNe Iax originate from deflagrations of near
M$_{\rm{ch}}$ hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs. Instead, the merger of a
carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon white dwarf is a promising model to explain SN
2021fcg.

a spiral arm in the circumstellar disk of its host star. We report
high-contrast imaging observations of GQ Lup B with VLT/NACO at 4-5 $\mu$m and
medium-resolution integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE. The optical
spectrum is consistent with an M9 spectral type, shows characteristics of a
low-gravity atmosphere, and exhibits strong H$\alpha$ emission. The $H-M'$
color is $\gtrsim$1 mag redder than field dwarfs with similar spectral types
and a detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) from optical
to mid-infrared wavelengths reveals excess emission in the $L'$, NB4.05, and
$M'$ bands. The excess flux is well described by a blackbody component with
$T_\mathrm{disk} \approx 460$ K and $R_\mathrm{disk} \approx 65\,R_\mathrm{J}$
and is expected to trace continuum emission from small grains in a protolunar
disk. We derive an extinction of $A_V \approx 2.3$ mag from the broadband SED
with a suspected origin in the vicinity of the companion. We also combine 15 yr
of astrometric measurements and constrain the mutual inclination with the
circumstellar disk to $84 \pm 9$ deg, indicating a tumultuous dynamical
evolution or a stellar-like formation pathway. From the measured H$\alpha$ flux

derive an accretion rate of $\dot{M} \approx

be a consequence of infall events occurring after the initial collapse phase of
a forming star. An encounter event of gas with a star can lead to the formation
of a second-generation disk after the initial protostellar collapse phase.
Additionally, observations of shadows in disks can be well described by a
configuration of misaligned inner and outer disk, such that the inner disk
casts a shadow on the outer disk. Carrying out altogether eleven 3D
hydrodynamical models with the moving mesh code AREPO, we test whether a late
encounter of an existing star-disk system with a cloudlet of gas can lead to
the formation of an outer disk that is misaligned with respect to the
primordial inner disk. Our models demonstrate that a second-generation disk
with large misalignment with respect to an existing primordial disk can easily
form if the infall angle is large. The second-generation outer disk is more
eccentric, though the asymmetric infall also triggers eccentricity of the inner
disk of $e\approx 0.05$ to $0.1$. Retrograde infall can lead to the formation
of counter-rotating disks and enhanced accretion. As the angular momentum of
the inner disk is reduced, the inner disk shrinks and a gap forms between the
two disks. The resulting misaligned disk system can survive for $\sim 100$ kyr
or longer without aligning each other even for low primordial disk masses given
an infall mass of $\sim 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$. A synthetic image reveals shadows
in the outer disk similar to the ones observed in multiple transition disks
that are caused by the misaligned inner disk. We conclude that late inclined
infall onto a star-disk system leads to the formation of a misaligned outer
disk. Infall might therefore be responsible for observations of shadows in at
least some transition disks.

evaporation dilutes the ALP relic abundance originally produced via the vacuum
misalignment mechanism, opening the parameter space with larger scales $f_a$

of future detectors as ABRACADABRA, KLASH, ADMX, and DM-Radio. Moreover, the

demonstrate that the chosen method of identifying star-forming galaxies
introduces a systematic uncertainty in the inferred normalization and width of

$\sim0.2$ dex respectively. To avoid this systematic, we instead parameterize
the density of the full galaxy population in the logM$^*$-logSFR-redshift plane
using a flexible neural network known as a normalizing flow. The resulting
star-forming sequence has a low-mass slope near unity and a much flatter slope
at higher masses, with a normalization $0.2-0.5$ dex lower than typical
inferences in the literature. We show this difference is due to the
sophistication of the Prospector stellar populations modeling: the
nonparametric star formation histories naturally produce higher masses while
the combination of individualized metallicity, dust, and star formation history
constraints produce lower star formation rates than typical UV+IR formulae. We
introduce a simple formalism to understand the difference between SFRs inferred
from spectral energy distribution fitting and standard template-based
approaches such as UV+IR SFRs. Finally, we demonstrate the inferred
star-forming sequence is consistent with predictions from theoretical models of

problem that provides well-predicted cosmological signatures with only three
extra parameters: the temperature of the twin sector, the abundance of twin
baryons, and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of twin electroweak symmetry
breaking. These parameters specify the behavior of twin radiation and the
acoustic oscillations of twin baryons, which lead to testable effects on the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS). While
collider searches can only probe the twin VEV, through a fit to cosmological
data we show that the existing CMB (Planck18 TTTEEE+lowE+lowT+lensing) and LSS
(KV450) data already provide useful constraints on the remaining MTH
parameters. Additionally, we show that the presence of twin radiation in this
model can raise the Hubble constant $H_0$ while the scattering twin baryons can
reduce the matter fluctuations $S_8$, which helps to relax the observed $H_0$
and $S_8$ tensions simultaneously. This scenario is different from the typical
$\Lambda$CDM + $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ model, in which extra radiation helps with
the Hubble tension but worsens the $S_8$ tension. For instance, when including
the SH0ES and Planck SZ data in the fit, we find that a universe with $\gtrsim
20\%$ of the dark matter comprised of twin baryons is preferred over
$\Lambda$CDM by $\sim4\sigma$. If the twin sector is indeed responsible for
resolving the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, future measurements from the Euclid
satellite and CMB Stage 4 experiment will further measure the twin parameters
to $O(1-10\%)$-level precision. Our study demonstrates how models with hidden
naturalness can potentially be probed using precision cosmological data.

points. However, such methods are designed for a finite sample dataset and lack
the ability to generalize to out-of-sample data. Moreover, since the number of
self-expressive coefficients grows quadratically with the number of data

paper, we propose a novel framework for subspace clustering, termed
Self-Expressive Network (SENet), which employs a properly designed neural
network to learn a self-expressive representation of the data. We show that our
SENet can not only learn the self-expressive coefficients with desired

we show that SENet can also be leveraged to perform subspace clustering on
large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic data and

operators to efficiently serve various emerging use cases in 5G. It is
challenging to optimize the utilization of network infrastructures while
guaranteeing the performance of network slices according to service level
agreements (SLAs). To solve this problem, we propose SafeSlicing that
introduces a new constraint-aware deep reinforcement learning (CaDRL) algorithm
to learn the optimal resource orchestration policy within two steps, i.e.,
offline training in a simulated environment and online learning with the real
network system. On optimizing the resource orchestration, we incorporate the
constraints on the statistical performance of slices in the reward function
using Lagrangian multipliers, and solve the Lagrangian relaxed problem via a
policy network. To satisfy the constraints on the system capacity, we design a
constraint network to map the latent actions generated from the policy network
to the orchestration actions such that the total resources allocated to network
slices do not exceed the system capacity. We prototype SafeSlicing on an
end-to-end testbed developed by using OpenAirInterface LTE, OpenDayLight-based
SDN, and CUDA GPU computing platform. The experimental results show that
SafeSlicing reduces more than 20% resource usage while meeting SLAs of network

the last decade. To date, these analytic approaches are statistical at their
core, characterizing what is and what was, while using this information to
drive decisions about what to do in the future. However, as we often view team
sports, such as soccer, hockey, and baseball, as pairwise win-lose encounters,
it seems natural to model these as zero-sum games. We propose such a model for
one important class of sports encounters: a baseball at-bat, which is a matchup
between a pitcher and a batter. Specifically, we propose a novel model of this
encounter as a zero-sum stochastic game, in which the goal of the batter is to
get on base, an outcome the pitcher aims to prevent. The value of this game is
the on-base percentage (i.e., the probability that the batter gets on base). In
principle, this stochastic game can be solved using classical approaches. The
main technical challenges lie in predicting the distribution of pitch locations
as a function of pitcher intention, predicting the distribution of outcomes if
the batter decides to swing at a pitch, and characterizing the level of
patience of a particular batter. We address these challenges by proposing novel
pitcher and batter representations as well as a novel deep neural network
architecture for outcome prediction. Our experiments using Kaggle data from the
2015 to 2018 Major League Baseball seasons demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

nonminimally coupled field with adiabatic initial conditions cause the
gravitational potential to decay on large scales. A comparison of the
cosmological data with the theoretical matter power spectrum yields the
following constraint on the coupling constant: $\xi \lesssim 0.01$. We also
consider isocurvature modes in our analysis. We argue that a mix of adiabatic

Here, we compare the quality of fit to cosmological data of this class of

model ($\Lambda$CDM) and some of the best smooth $H(z)$ deformation models
($w$CDM, CPL, PEDE). We also perform model selection via the Akaike Information

spectrum data, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, the Pantheon SnIa
data, the SnIa absolute magnitude $M$ as determined by Cepheid calibrators and
the value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ as determined by local SnIa calibrated
using Cepheids. We find that smooth $H(z)$ deformation models perform worse
than transition models for the following reasons: 1) They have a worse fit to
low-$z$ geometric probes (BAO and SnIa data); 2) They favor values of the SnIa
absolute magnitude $M$ that are lower as compared to the value $M_c$ obtained
with local Cepheid calibrators at $z<0.01$; 3) They tend to worsen the
$\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}-\sigma_\mathrm{8,0}$ growth tension. We also find that the
$w-M$ transition model ($LwMT$) does not provide a better quality of fit to
cosmological data than a pure $M$ transition model ($LMT$) where $w$ is fixed
to the \lcdm value $w=-1$ at all redshifts. We conclude that the $LMT$ model
has significant statistical advantages over smooth late-time $H(z)$ deformation
models in addressing the Hubble crisis.

relation between location in the projected phase space and infall time to
explore the time delay between morphological and specific Star Formation Rate

happens in $\rm \Delta t_{inf} \sim$1 Gyr, whereas the quenching of star
formation takes $\sim$3 Gyr. The time-scale we estimate for morphological

train a common machine learning model without sharing their private/proprietary
training data among each other. FL is unfortunately susceptible to poisoning by
malicious clients who aim to hamper the accuracy of the commonly trained model
through sending malicious model updates during FL's training process.
  We argue that the key factor to the success of poisoning attacks against
existing FL systems is the large space of model updates available to the
clients, allowing malicious clients to search for the most poisonous model
updates, e.g., by solving an optimization problem. To address this, we propose
Federated Rank Learning (FRL). FRL reduces the space of client updates from
model parameter updates (a continuous space of float numbers) in standard FL to
the space of parameter rankings (a discrete space of integer values). To be
able to train the global model using parameter ranks (instead of parameter
weights), FRL leverage ideas from recent supermasks training mechanisms.
Specifically, FRL clients rank the parameters of a randomly initialized neural
network (provided by the server) based on their local training data. The FRL
server uses a voting mechanism to aggregate the parameter rankings submitted by
clients in each training epoch to generate the global ranking of the next
training epoch.
  Intuitively, our voting-based aggregation mechanism prevents poisoning
clients from making significant adversarial modifications to the global model,
as each client will have a single vote! We demonstrate the robustness of FRL to
poisoning through analytical proofs and experimentation. We also show FRL's
high communication efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of
FRL in real-world FL settings.

composition x. However, luminescence spectra exhibited above band-gap features,

The results are correlated with light-scattering tomography, revealing the

networks can be organized as multivariate time series with additional spatial
attributes. A crucial task in analyzing such data is to identify and detect
anomalous observations and events from the data with complex spatial and
temporal dependencies. Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is a widely
used tool for anomaly detection. However, the traditional RPCA purely relies on
the global low-rank assumption while ignoring the local temporal correlations.
In light of this, this study proposes a Hankel-structured tensor version of
RPCA for anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data. We treat the raw data with
anomalies as a multivariate time series matrix (location $\times$ time) and
assume the denoised matrix has a low-rank structure. Then we transform the
low-rank matrix to a third-order tensor by applying temporal Hankelization. In
the end, we decompose the corrupted matrix into a low-rank Hankel tensor and a
sparse matrix. With the Hankelization operation, the model can simultaneously
capture the global and local spatiotemporal correlations and exhibit more
robust performance. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem and use
tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to approximate the tensor rank and $l_1$ norm to
approximate the sparsity. We develop an efficient solution algorithm based on
the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Despite having three
hyper-parameters, the model is easy to set in practice. We evaluate the
proposed method by synthetic data and metro passenger flow time series and the
results demonstrate the accuracy of anomaly detection.

learned skills. Analogously, hierarchical reinforcement learning seeks to
leverage lower-level policies for simple tasks to solve complex ones. However,
because each lower-level policy induces a different distribution of states,
transitioning from one lower-level policy to another may fail due to an
unexpected starting state. We introduce transition policies that smoothly
connect lower-level policies by producing a distribution of states and actions
that matches what is expected by the next policy. Training transition policies
is challenging because the natural reward signal -- whether the next policy can
execute its subtask successfully -- is sparse. By training transition policies
via adversarial inverse reinforcement learning to match the distribution of
expected states and actions, we avoid relying on task-based reward. To further
improve performance, we use deep Q-learning with a binary action space to
determine when to switch from a transition policy to the next pre-trained
policy, using the success or failure of the next subtask as the reward.
Although the reward is still sparse, the problem is less severe due to the
simple binary action space. We demonstrate our method on continuous bipedal
locomotion and arm manipulation tasks that require diverse skills. We show that
it smoothly connects the lower-level policies, achieving higher success rates
than previous methods that search for successful trajectories based on a reward

briefly summarize the main achievements in the research of thermosphere
response to extreme magnetic storms occurring particularly after the launching
of many satellites with state-of-the-art accelerometers from which
high-accuracy density can be determined. We find that the performance of an
empirical model with data assimilation is higher than its performance without
data assimilation during all extreme storm phases. We discuss how forecasting
models can be improved by looking into two directions: first, to the past, by
adapting historical extreme storm datasets for density predictions, and second,
to the future, by facilitating the assimilation of large-scale thermosphere
data sets that will be collected in future events. Therefore, this topic is
relevant to the scientific community, government agencies that operate
satellites, and the private sector with assets operating in LEO.

useful representations, and yet much of the success is achieved in data types

advantage of spatial, temporal, or semantic structure in the data through
augmentation. However, such structure may not exist in tabular datasets
commonly used in fields such as healthcare, making it difficult to design an
effective augmentation method, and hindering a similar progress in tabular data
setting. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, Subsetting features of
Tabular data (SubTab), that turns the task of learning from tabular data into a
multi-view representation learning problem by dividing the input features to
multiple subsets. We argue that reconstructing the data from the subset of its
features rather than its corrupted version in an autoencoder setting can better
capture its underlying latent representation. In this framework, the joint
representation can be expressed as the aggregate of latent variables of the
subsets at test time, which we refer to as collaborative inference. Our
experiments show that the SubTab achieves the state of the art (SOTA)
performance of 98.31% on MNIST in tabular setting, on par with CNN-based SOTA
models, and surpasses existing baselines on three other real-world datasets by
a significant margin.

prohibitive as the model size and the number of tasks grow. Recent work has
proposed a variety of parameter-efficient transfer learning methods that only

While effective, the critical ingredients for success and the connections among
the various methods are poorly understood. In this paper, we break down the

Specifically, we re-frame them as modifications to specific hidden states in

machine translation, text summarization, language understanding, and text

design choices in previous methods. Furthermore, our unified framework enables
the transfer of design elements across different approaches, and as a result we
are able to instantiate new parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that tune
less parameters than previous methods while being more effective, achieving
comparable results to fine-tuning all parameters on all four tasks.

Our results demonstrate that successful model and hyperparameter choices allow
the early optimization trajectory to either avoid -- or navigate out of --

mitigation strategies for training instability ultimately address the same

The new proposed governing equations for fluid dynamics use vorticity tensor

rotation; 2. The physical meaning of off diagonal elements is clear, which is

sample selection bias between the training and testing data. In this paper, we
develop a framework for fair regression under sample selection bias when
dependent variable values of a set of samples from the training data are
missing as a result of another hidden process. Our framework adopts the classic
Heckman model for bias correction and the Lagrange duality to achieve fairness
in regression based on a variety of fairness notions. Heckman model describes
the sample selection process and uses a derived variable called the Inverse
Mills Ratio (IMR) to correct sample selection bias. We use fairness inequality
and equality constraints to describe a variety of fairness notions and apply
the Lagrange duality theory to transform the primal problem into the dual
convex optimization. For the two popular fairness notions, mean difference and
mean squared error difference, we derive explicit formulas without iterative
optimization, and for Pearson correlation, we derive its conditions of
achieving strong duality. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets

paper continues a series aimed at refining three-dimensional (3D)
hydrodynamical models of disk instabilities, where the handling of the gas
thermodynamics is a crucial factor. Boss (2017, 2019, 2021) used the $\beta$
cooling approximation (Gammie 2001) to calculate 3D models of disks with
initial masses of 0.091 $M_\odot$ extending from 4 to 20 au around 1 $M_\odot$
protostars. Here we employ 3D flux-limited diffusion (FLD) approximation models
of the same disks, in order to provide a superior treatment of disk gas
thermodynamics. The new models have quadrupled spatial resolution compared to
previous 3D FLD models (Boss 2008, 2012), in both the radial and azimuthal
spherical coordinates, resulting in the highest spatial resolution 3D FLD
models to date. The new models continue to support the hypothesis that such
disks can form self-gravitating, dense clumps capable of contracting to form
gas giant protoplanets, and suggest that the FLD models yield similar numbers
of clumps as $\beta$ cooling models with $\beta \sim$ 1 to $\sim$ 10, including

topological heuristics with the feature-learning ability of neural networks. It
summarizes a putative link by random walk probabilities of adjacent paths.
Instead of extracting transition probabilities from the original graph, it
computes the transition matrix of a ""predictive"" latent graph by applying
attention to learned features; this may be interpreted as feature-sensitive
topology fingerprinting. WalkPool can leverage unsupervised node features or be
combined with GNNs and trained end-to-end. It outperforms state-of-the-art

information and candidate goal-points. Agents deploy communication beacons at
different points in the environment, extending the range at which maps and

supervisors, allowing agents to detect and localize artifacts and explore
autonomously outside established communication networks. Given the scale,

While the TT format makes these problems tractable, iterative techniques for

novel agent-based model of viral spread on networks where agents may either
wear no mask or wear one of several types of masks with different properties
(e.g., cloth or surgical). We derive analytical expressions for three key
epidemiological quantities: the probability of emergence, the epidemic
threshold, and the expected epidemic size. In particular, we show how the
aforementioned quantities depend on the structure of the contact network, viral
transmission dynamics, and the distribution of the different types of masks
within the population. Through extensive simulations, we then investigate the
impact of different allocations of masks within the population and trade-offs
between the outward efficiency and inward efficiency of the masks.
Interestingly, we find that masks with high outward efficiency and low inward
efficiency are most useful for controlling the spread in the early stages of an
epidemic, while masks with high inward efficiency but low outward efficiency
are most useful in reducing the size of an already large spread. Lastly, we
study whether degree-based mask allocation is more effective in reducing the
probability of epidemic as well as epidemic size compared to random allocation.
The result echoes the previous findings that mitigation strategies should
differ based on the stage of the spreading process, focusing on source control
before the epidemic emerges and on self-protection after the emergence.

representations without annotations, even outperforming supervised baselines.
However, it still lacks important properties useful for real-world application,
one of which is uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a simple way to generate
uncertainty scores for many contrastive methods by re-purposing temperature, a
mysterious hyperparameter used for scaling. By observing that temperature
controls how sensitive the objective is to specific embedding locations, we aim
to learn temperature as an input-dependent variable, treating it as a measure
of embedding confidence. We call this approach ""Temperature as Uncertainty"", or
TaU. Through experiments, we demonstrate that TaU is useful for
out-of-distribution detection, while remaining competitive with benchmarks on
linear evaluation. Moreover, we show that TaU can be learned on top of
pretrained models, enabling uncertainty scores to be generated post-hoc with
popular off-the-shelf models. In summary, TaU is a simple yet versatile method
for generating uncertainties for contrastive learning. Open source code can be

evaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve
access to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the
semantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content.
In response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed
by natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a
grounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of
semantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g.,
marks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g.,
extrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena
(e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights
(e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be
applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct
a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that
these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as
most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful
information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic
visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly
communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences. Our
work further opens a space of research on natural language as a data interface

formation and evolution of galaxies. The arrival of wide-field surveys such as
the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) offers new
possibilities for the study of GCs. Nevertheless, GCs are not detected a priori
by the data reduction pipeline of J-PLUS and, due to its pixel scale, the
standard techniques of GCs detection are challenged. To fill this gap, we
develop a semi-automatic pipeline to detect GCs in J-PLUS that can also be
adapted to similar surveys. As a case study, we use data from the S0 galaxy NGC
1023 and we also study the stellar population content of GC candidates in the
galaxy. To detect GCs, our methodology is based on Source Extractor and does
not require a previous filtering or modelling of the host galaxy. We study
colors and perform spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis on our final GC
candidate catalog to obtain stellar population parameters. In NGC 1023,
GCFinder identifies 523 GC candidates. We observe evidence of color bimodality
in a few broad-band colors but not on narrow-band colors. The SED analysis
reveals a clear metallicity bimodality and we observe that narrow-band filters
are very useful to constrain metallicities. We also identified a broad
age-metallicity relation as well as a wide metallicity distribution that are
evidence that NGC 1023 experienced accretion events in the past. It is the
first time this kind of study is performed with J-PLUS data. By detecting GC
candidates in wide-field images without modeling the light of the galaxy,
GCFinder becomes considerably faster, at a marginal loss of centrally-located
GC candidates of about 7 percent. As GCFinder is entirely based on Source
Extractor, it could be easily incorporated into automated software handling
wide-field surveys.

quadruped locomotion. The vision-based navigation method proposed in this study
is applicable in such a small-scale quadruped robot platform in which the
computation resources and space are limited. The semantic segmentation based on
a CNN model is adopted for the real-time path segmentation in the outdoor
environment. The desired traverse trajectory is generated through real-time
updating the middle line, which is calculated from the edge position of the
segmented path in the images. To enhance the stability of the path planning
directly based on the semantic segmentation method, a trajectory compensation
method is supplemented considering the temporal information to revise the
untrustworthy planned path. Experiments of semantic segmentation and navigation
in a garden scene are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

used to model rates and proportions. However, these models are usually
specified in terms of a conditional mean. Therefore, they may be inadequate if
the observed response variable follows an asymmetrical distribution, such as
CFR data. In addition, beta regression models do not consider the effect of the
covariates across the spectrum of the dependent variable, which is possible
through the conditional quantile approach. In order to introduce the proposed
GB3 regression model, we first reparameterize the GB3 distribution by inserting
a quantile parameter and then we develop the new proposed quantile model. We
also propose a simple interpretation of the predictor-response relationship in

carried out for evaluating the performance of the maximum likelihood estimates

acquiring accurate 3D human motion in computer vision, medicine, and graphics.
The raw output of these systems are noisy and incomplete 3D points or short
tracklets of points. To be useful, one must associate these points with
corresponding markers on the captured subject; i.e. ""labelling"". Given these
labels, one can then ""solve"" for the 3D skeleton or body surface mesh.
Commercial auto-labeling tools require a specific calibration procedure at
capture time, which is not possible for archival data. Here we train a novel
neural network called SOMA, which takes raw mocap point clouds with varying
numbers of points, labels them at scale without any calibration data,
independent of the capture technology, and requiring only minimal human
intervention. Our key insight is that, while labeling point clouds is highly
ambiguous, the 3D body provides strong constraints on the solution that can be
exploited by a learning-based method. To enable learning, we generate massive
training sets of simulated noisy and ground truth mocap markers animated by 3D
bodies from AMASS. SOMA exploits an architecture with stacked self-attention
elements to learn the spatial structure of the 3D body and an optimal transport
layer to constrain the assignment (labeling) problem while rejecting outliers.
We extensively evaluate SOMA both quantitatively and qualitatively. SOMA is
more accurate and robust than existing state of the art research methods and
can be applied where commercial systems cannot. We automatically label over 8
hours of archival mocap data across 4 different datasets captured using various
technologies and output SMPL-X body models. The model and data is released for

of interest, though smaller than the sample size, challenges inference on their

neither the de-biased lasso approach (van de Geer et al. 2014), which assumes
sparsity on the inverse information matrix, nor the standard maximum likelihood

for generalized linear models. Under this ""large $n$, diverging $p$"" scenario,
we propose an alternative de-biased lasso approach by directly inverting the
Hessian matrix without imposing the matrix sparsity assumption, which further
reduces bias compared to the original de-biased lasso and ensures valid
confidence intervals with nominal coverage probabilities. We establish the
asymptotic distributions of any linear combinations of the parameter estimates,
which lays the theoretical ground for drawing inference. Simulations show that
the proposed refined de-biased estimating method performs well in removing bias
and yields honest confidence interval coverage. We use the proposed method to
analyze the aforementioned BLCSC data, a large scale hospital-based

most modern hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. In this short
paper, we make use of 4 sets of large hydrodynamical simulations to explore the
size-spin parameter relation with a large sample of simulated disk galaxies,
and compare it with a popular disk galaxy formation model of Mo et al. (1998).
Intriguingly, galactic sizes correlate strongly with spin parameters of their
dark matter haloes in the simulations developed by the IllustrisTNG
collaborations, albeit the relation does not always agree with prediction of

correlation for the Milky way analogies in the EAGLE simulations, while it is
relatively weaker than that of the IllustrisTNG counterparts. For the dwarfs in
the simulations from the EAGLE collaboration, there is NULL correlation. We
conclude that either the detailed subgrid physics or hydrodynamics solvers

RIS model with higher demands for investigating fine-grained matching behaviors
between words in expressions and objects presented in images. However, such
matching behaviors are hard to be learned and captured when the visual cues of
referents (i.e. referred objects) are insufficient, as the referents with weak
visual cues tend to be easily confused by cluttered background at boundary or
even overwhelmed by salient objects in the image. And the insufficient visual
cues issue can not be handled by the cross-modal fusion mechanisms as done in
previous work. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a novel perspective
of enhancing the visual information for the referents by devising a Two-stage

enjoys better performances in learning fine-grained matching behaviors between

(CNN) which uses video and audio data during speech to distinguish
schizophrenic patients with strong positive symptoms from healthy subjects. We
also show that the vocal tract variables (TVs) which correspond to place of

relics appear at the same location as shocks as seen in the X-ray. In a
previous work, we suggested that the shape of some relics may result from the
pre-existing spatial distribution of cosmic-ray electrons, and tested this

these motions could transport the cosmic ray-enriched material of the AGN

filamentary shape resembling a radio relic. In this work, we improve our
physical description for the cosmic rays by modeling them as a separate fluid

Replication (SMR) that dynamically allocates the state to be transferred among
replicas according to changes in communication bandwidths. SMR is a method that
improves fault tolerance by replicating a service to multiple replicas. When a
replica is newly added or is recovered from a failure, the other replicas
transfer the current state of the service to it. However, in geographic SMR,
the communication bandwidths of replicas are different and constantly changing.
Therefore, existing state transfer methods cannot fully utilize the available
bandwidth, and their state transfer time becomes long. To overcome this
problem, our method divides the state into multiple chunks and assigns them to
replicas based on each replica's bandwidth so that the broader a replica's
bandwidth is, the more chunks it transfers. The number of assigned chunks is
dynamically updated based on the currently estimated bandwidth. The performance
evaluation on Amazon EC2 shows that the proposed method reduces the state
transfer time by up to 47% compared with the existing one.

to non-expert users, we propose the framework ""Scene Editing as Teleoperation""
(SEaT), where the key idea is to transform the traditional ""robot-centric""
interface into a ""scene-centric"" interface -- instead of controlling the robot,
users focus on specifying the task's goal by manipulating digital twins of the
real-world objects. As a result, a user can perform teleoperation without any
expert knowledge of the robot hardware. To achieve this goal, we utilize a
category-agnostic scene-completion algorithm that translates the real-world
workspace (with unknown objects) into a manipulable virtual scene
representation and an action-snapping algorithm that refines the user input
before generating the robot's action plan. To train the algorithms, we
procedurally generated a large-scale, diverse kit-assembly dataset that
contains object-kit pairs that mimic real-world object-kitting tasks. Our
experiments in simulation and on a real-world system demonstrate that our
framework improves both the efficiency and success rate for 6DoF kit-assembly
tasks. A user study demonstrates that SEaT framework participants achieve a
higher task success rate and report a lower subjective workload compared to an
alternative robot-centric interface. Video can be found at

automatically selected using the sentence similarity determined by
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). In addition, we
use ''target'' style embedding from a Pre-trained encoder as a constraint by

  Non-Gaussianity","10 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stac743",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Line intensity mapping (LIM) has the potential to produce highly precise
measurements of scale-dependence bias from primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) due
to its ability to map much larger volumes than are available from galaxy
surveys. PNG parameterized by $f_{NL}$ leads to a scale-dependent correction to
the bias, and therefore a correction to the line intensity power spectrum.
However, LIM experiences contamination from foreground emission, including
interloping emission lines from other redshifts which alter the power spectra
of the maps at these scales, potentially biasing measurements of $f_{NL}$. Here
we model the effect of line interlopers on upcoming line intensity mapping
probes of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) from inflation. As an example, we
consider the $[\rm CII]$ line at target redshift $z_t = 3.6$ to probe PNG, with
the important systematic concern being foreground contamination from CO lines
residing at redshifts different from the target redshift. We find interloper
lines can lead to a significant bias and an increase in errors for our PNG
constraints, leading to a false positive for non-standard inflation models. We
model how well the cross-correlation technique could reduce this interloper
contamination. We find the uncertainty of $f_{NL}$ reduces by factors of two
and six for local and orthogonal shape PNG respectively, and by a factor of
five for local shape if we consider seven interloper lines, almost eliminating
the effect of interlopers. This work shows that using cross-power and
auto-power spectra of line intensity maps jointly could potentially remove the
effects of interlopers when measuring non-Gaussianity.

support for refinement types: data types augmented with SMT-decidable logical
predicates that refine the set of values that can inhabit a type. Furthermore,
Liquid Haskell's support for refinement reflection enables the use of Haskell
for general-purpose mechanized theorem proving. A growing list of large-scale
mechanized proof developments in Liquid Haskell take advantage of this
capability. Adding theorem-proving capabilities to a ""legacy"" language like
Haskell lets programmers directly verify properties of real-world Haskell
programs (taking advantage of the existing highly tuned compiler, run-time
system, and libraries), just by writing Haskell. However, more established
proof assistants like Agda and Coq offer far better support for interactive
proof development and insight into the proof state (for instance, what subgoals
still need to be proved to finish a partially-complete proof). In contrast,
Liquid Haskell provides only coarse-grained feedback to the user -- either it
reports a type error, or not -- unfortunately hindering its usability as a
theorem prover.
  In this paper, we propose improving the usability of Liquid Haskell by
extending it with support for Agda-style typed holes and interactive editing
commands that take advantage of them. In Agda, typed holes allow programmers to
indicate unfinished parts of a proof, and incrementally complete the proof in a
dialogue with the compiler. While GHC Haskell already has its own Agda-inspired
support for typed holes, we posit that typed holes would be especially powerful
and useful if combined with Liquid Haskell's refinement types and SMT
automation. We discuss how typed holes might work in Liquid Haskell, and we
consider possible implementation approaches and next steps.

information and power transfer (SLIPT), has unique advantages such as abundant
spectrum resources and low propagation divergence, compared with
radio-frequency (RF) SWIPT. However, optical SWIPT faces many challenges in
beam steering and receiver positioning/tracking. Resonant beams generated by
spatially separated laser resonators (SSLR) have many advantages, including
high power, self-aligned mobility, and intrinsic safety. It has been proposed
as the carrier of wireless charging and communication. Using resonant beams,
mobile electronic devices can be remotely charged and supported with high-rate
data transfer. In this paper, we propose a mobile optical SWIPT system based on
asymmetric SSLR and present the system optimization procedure. We also
determine the boundary of the charging power and communication rate, and
discuss the trade-off between power transfer and information transfer.
Numerical results show that both the charging power and the communication rate
of the optimized asymmetric system are much higher than those of the symmetric

vertices and edges in networks, including the Mostar index which was recently
introduced as a measure of peripherality for both edges and networks. We refute
a conjecture on the maximum possible Mostar index of bipartite graphs from
(Do\v{s}li\'{c} et al, Journal of Mathematical Chemistry, 2018) and (Ali and
Do\v{s}li\'{c}, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 2021). We also correct a
result from the latter paper, where they claimed that the maximum possible
value of the terminal Mostar index among all trees of order $n$ is
$(n-1)(n-2)$. We show that this maximum is $(n-1)(n-3)$ for $n \ge 3$, and that
it is only attained by the star.
  We asymptotically answer another problem on the maximum difference between
the Mostar index and the irregularity of trees from (F. Gao et al, On the
difference of Mostar index and irregularity of graphs, Bulletin of the
Malaysian Mathematical Sciences Society, 2021). We also prove a number of
extremal bounds and computational complexity results about the Mostar index,
irregularity, and measures of peripherality and centrality.
  We discuss graphs where the Mostar index is not an accurate measure of
peripherality. We construct a general family of graphs with the property that
the Mostar index is strictly greater for edges that are closer to the center.
We also investigate centrality and peripherality in two graphs which represent
the SuperFast and MOZART-4 systems of atmospheric chemical reactions by
computing various measures of peripherality and centrality for the vertices and
edges in these graphs. For both of these graphs, we find that the Mostar index
is closer to a measure of centrality than peripherality of the edges. We also
introduce some new indices which perform well as measures of peripherality on
the SuperFast and MOZART-4 graphs.

the design of channel encoders and decoders via deep learning. Due the
dimensionality challenge in channel coding, it is prohibitively complex to
design and train relatively large neural channel codes via deep learning
techniques. Consequently, most of the results in the literature are limited to
relatively short codes having less than 100 information bits. In this paper, we
construct ProductAEs, a computationally efficient family of deep-learning
driven (encoder, decoder) pairs, that aim at enabling the training of
relatively large channel codes (both encoders and decoders) with a manageable
training complexity. We build upon the ideas from classical product codes, and
propose constructing large neural codes using smaller code components. More
specifically, instead of directly training the encoder and decoder for a large
neural code of dimension $k$ and blocklength $n$, we provide a framework that
requires training neural encoders and decoders for the code parameters
$(n_1,k_1)$ and $(n_2,k_2)$ such that $n_1 n_2=n$ and $k_1 k_2=k$. Our training
results show significant gains, over all ranges of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),

$(441,196)$, over polar codes under successive cancellation (SC) decoder.
Moreover, our results demonstrate meaningful gains over Turbo Autoencoder

enforced by the symmetries of the system, because the ground states are

hydronium in water has been a challenging task from ab initio molecular
dynamics (AIMD). The difficulty mainly comes from a lack of accurate and
efficient exchange-correlation functional in elucidating the amphiphilic nature
and the ubiquitous proton transfer behaviors of the two ions. By adopting the
strongly-constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA functional in
AIMD simulations, we systematically examine the amphiphilic properties, the
solvation structures, the electronic structures, and the dynamic properties of
the two water ions. In particular, we compare these results to those predicted
by the PBE0-TS functional, which is an accurate yet computationally more
expensive exchange-correlation functional. We demonstrate that the
general-purpose SCAN functional provides a reliable choice in describing the
two water ions. Specifically, in the SCAN picture of water ions, the appearance
of the fourth and fifth hydrogen bonds near hydroxide stabilizes the pot-like
shape solvation structure and suppresses the structural diffusion, while the
hydronium stably donates three hydrogen bonds to its neighbors. As a result,
hydroxide prefers the stepwise proton transfer (PT) while hydronium prefers the
concerted PT behavior. Consequently, hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium
in water, which is consistent with the experiments.

attacker's ability in the proposed action poisoning attack model is more
restricted, which brings some design challenges. We study the action poisoning

dynamic regret scales sublinearly with the total number of steps taken, to
choose actions according to a policy selected by the attacker very frequently,
with only sublinear cost. In addition, we apply LCB-H attack against a popular
model-free RL algorithm: UCB-H. We show that, even in the black-box setting, by
spending only logarithm cost, the proposed LCB-H attack scheme can force the
UCB-H agent to choose actions according to the policy selected by the attacker

self-adaptive multi-task particle swarm optimization (SaMTPSO) through the
developed knowledge transfer adaptation strategy, the focus search strategy and
the knowledge incorporation strategy. In the knowledge transfer adaptation
strategy, each task has a knowledge source pool that consists of all knowledge
sources. Each source (task) outputs knowledge to the task. And knowledge
transfer adapts to task relatedness via individuals' choice on different
sources of a pool, where the chosen probabilities for different sources are
computed respectively according to task's success rate in generating improved
solutions via these sources. In the focus search strategy, if there is no
knowledge source benefit the optimization of a task, then all knowledge sources

accuracy reduce due to overlooking the feature of significant attention regions

same category query hash codes mapping into the different cluster in database
hash latent space. To handle these two issues, we propose a feature consistency
driven attention erasing network (FCAENet) for fine-grained image retrieval.
For the first issue, we propose an adaptive augmentation module in FCAENet,
which is selective region erasing module (SREM). SREM makes the network more
robust on subtle differences of fine-grained task by adaptively covering some
regions of raw images. The feature extractor and hash layer can learn more
representative hash code for fine-grained images by SREM. With regard to the
second issue, we fully exploit the pair-wise similarity information and add the
enhancing space relation loss (ESRL) in FCAENet to make the vulnerable relation
stabler between the query hash code and database hash code. We conduct
extensive experiments on five fine-grained benchmark datasets (CUB2011,

the first comprehensive study which assesses the robustness of CNN-based models

weight reactivation methods usually reactivate the entire filters, which may
not be precise enough. Looking back in history, the prosperity of filter
pruning is mainly due to its friendliness to hardware implementation, but
pruning at a finer structure level, i.e., weight elements, usually leads to
better network performance. We study the problem of weight element reactivation
in this paper. Motivated by evolution, we select the unimportant filters and
update their unimportant elements by combining them with the important elements
of important filters, just like gene crossover to produce better offspring, and
the proposed method is called weight evolution (WE). WE is mainly composed of
four strategies. We propose a global selection strategy and a local selection
strategy and combine them to locate the unimportant filters. A forward matching
strategy is proposed to find the matched important filters and a crossover

topic in many fields, such as network and finite-element analysis. The existing

computational cost than is actually needed. By introducing two novel concepts,
i.e., real bandwidth and bandwidth, to measure the sparsity of the matrix, the
sparsity of the matrix exponential is analyzed. It is found that for every
matrix computed in the squaring phase of the SSA, a corresponding sparse
approximate matrix exists. To obtain the sparse approximate matrix, a new
filtering technique in terms of forward error analysis is proposed. Combining
the filtering technique with the idea of keeping track of the incremental part,
a competitive algorithm is developed for the large sparse matrix exponential.
The proposed method can primarily alleviate the over-scaling problem due to the
filtering technique. Three sets of numerical experiments, including one large

several studies attempt to address the FSRSSC problem by following few-shot
natural image classification methods. These existing methods have made
promising progress and achieved superior performance. However, they all
overlook two unique characteristics of remote sensing images: (i) object
co-occurrence that multiple objects tend to appear together in a scene image
and (ii) object spatial correlation that these co-occurrence objects are
distributed in the scene image following some spatial structure patterns. Such
unique characteristics are very beneficial for FSRSSC, which can effectively
alleviate the scarcity issue of labeled remote sensing images since they can
provide more refined descriptions for each scene class. To fully exploit these
characteristics, we propose a novel scene graph matching-based meta-learning
framework for FSRSSC, called SGMNet. In this framework, a scene graph
construction module is carefully designed to represent each test remote sensing
image or each scene class as a scene graph, where the nodes reflect these
co-occurrence objects meanwhile the edges capture the spatial correlations
between these co-occurrence objects. Then, a scene graph matching module is
further developed to evaluate the similarity score between each test remote
sensing image and each scene class. Finally, based on the similarity scores, we
perform the scene class prediction via a nearest neighbor classifier. We
conduct extensive experiments on UCMerced LandUse, WHU19, AID, and

networks that allows distributed execution using only local information, yet is
able to share experience between global symmetries in the joint state-action

complex symmetries arise between different configurations of the agents and
their local observations. For example, consider a group of agents navigating:
rotating the state globally results in a permutation of the optimal joint
policy. Existing work on symmetries in single agent reinforcement learning can
only be generalized to the fully centralized setting, because such approaches
rely on the global symmetry in the full state-action spaces, and these can
result in correspondences across agents. To encode such symmetries while still
allowing distributed execution we propose a factorization that decomposes
global symmetries into local transformations. Our proposed factorization allows
for distributing the computation that enforces global symmetries over local
agents and local interactions. We introduce a multi-agent equivariant policy

mass spectrum using a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a
center-of-mass energy of 13$~\rm TeV$, collected by the LHCb experiment and
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $6~{\rm fb}^{-1}$. The minimal
quark content of the ${\it\Lambda}_b^0 K^-\pi^+$ system indicates that these
are excited ${\it\Xi}_b^0$ baryons. The masses of the ${\it\Xi}_b(6327)^0$ and
${\it\Xi}_b(6333)^0$ states are $m({\it\Xi}_b(6327)^0) = 6327.28
^{\,+\,0.23}_{\,-\,0.21} \pm 0.12 \pm 0.24~{\rm MeV}$ and
$m({\it\Xi}_b(6333)^0) = 6332.69 ^{\,+\,0.17}_{\,-\,0.18} \pm 0.03 \pm
0.22~{\rm MeV}$, respectively, with a mass splitting of $\Delta m = 5.41
^{\,+\,0.26}_{\,-\,0.27} \pm 0.12 ~{\rm MeV}$, where the uncertainties are
statistical, systematic and due to the ${\it\Lambda}_b^0$ mass measurement. The
measured natural widths of these states are consistent with zero, with upper
limits of $\Gamma({\it\Xi}_b(6327)^0)<2.20~(2.56) ~{\rm MeV}$ and
$\Gamma({\it\Xi}_b(6333)^0)<1.60~(1.92) ~{\rm MeV}$ at a $90\%~(95\%)$
credibility level. The significance of the two-peak hypothesis is larger than
nine (five) Gaussian standard deviations compared to the no-peak (one-peak)
hypothesis. The masses, widths and resonant structure of the new states are in
good agreement with the expectations for a doublet of 1$D$ ${\it\Xi}_b^0$
resonances.

measurements of unprecedented accuracy. Due to shifts in atomic energy levels,
quantum sensors often have stringent requirements on their internal magnetic
field environment. Typically, background magnetic fields are attenuated using
high permeability magnetic shielding, with the cancelling of residual and
introduction of quantisation fields implemented with coils inside the shield.
The high permeability shield, however, distorts all magnetic fields, including
those generated inside the sensor. Here, we demonstrate a solution by designing
multiple coils overlaid on a 3D-printed former to generate three uniform and
three constant linear gradient magnetic fields inside the capped cylindrical
magnetic shield of a cold atom interferometer. The fields are characterised
in-situ and match their desired forms to high accuracy. For example, the
uniform transverse field, $B_x$, deviates by less than $0.2$% over more than
$40$% of the length of the shield. We also map the field directly using the
cold atoms and investigate the potential of the coil system to reduce bias from
the quadratic Zeeman effect. This coil design technology enables targeted field
compensation over large spatial volumes and has the potential to reduce
systematic shifts and noise in numerous cold atom systems.

generalizes the CBO algorithm in [11] to tackle a constrained optimization
problem for the global minima of the non-convex function defined on a convex

portfolio optimization problem in finance. In this application, we introduce an
objective function to choose the optimal weight on each asset in a asset-bundle

Simulation results show that our proposed predictor-corrector type model is
successful in finding the optimal value.

representations of Garside categories, a notion which originated from the study
of Braid groups. Every higher rank graph is a Garside category in a natural
way. We develop a general classification result for closed invariant subspaces
of our groupoids as well as criteria for topological freeness and local
contractiveness, properties which are relevant for the structure of the
corresponding C*-algebras. Our results provide a conceptual explanation for

consumption data generated from the smart grid prove to be an effective
solution in reducing Non Technical Loses (NTLs), thereby ensures safety,
reliability, and security of the smart energy systems. However, imbalanced
data, consecutive missing values, large training times, and complex
architectures hinder the real time application of electricity theft detection
models. In this paper, we present EnsembleNTLDetect, a robust and scalable
electricity theft detection framework that employs a set of efficient data
pre-processing techniques and machine learning models to accurately detect
electricity theft by analysing consumers' electricity consumption patterns.
This framework utilises an enhanced Dynamic Time Warping Based Imputation
(eDTWBI) algorithm to impute missing values in the time series data and
leverages the Near-miss undersampling technique to generate balanced data.
Further, stacked autoencoder is introduced for dimensionality reduction and to
improve training efficiency. A Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
(CTGAN) is used to augment the dataset to ensure robust training and a soft
voting ensemble classifier is designed to detect the consumers with aberrant
consumption patterns. Furthermore, experiments were conducted on the real-time
electricity consumption data provided by the State Grid Corporation of China
(SGCC) to validate the reliability and efficiency of EnsembleNTLDetect over the
state-of-the-art electricity theft detection models in terms of various quality
metrics.

online education, and social network service. Temporal interaction network
embedding can effectively mine the information in temporal interaction
networks, which is of great significance to the above fields. Usually, the
occurrence of an interaction affects not only the nodes directly involved in
the interaction (interacting nodes), but also the neighbor nodes of interacting
nodes. However, existing temporal interaction network embedding methods only
use historical interaction relations to mine neighbor nodes, ignoring other
relation types. In this paper, we propose a multi-relation aware temporal
interaction network embedding method (MRATE). Based on historical interactions,
MRATE mines historical interaction relations, common interaction relations, and
interaction sequence similarity relations to obtain the neighbor based
embeddings of interacting nodes. The hierarchical multi-relation aware
aggregation method in MRATE first employs graph attention networks (GATs) to
aggregate the interaction impacts propagated through a same relation type and
then combines the aggregated interaction impacts from multiple relation types
through the self-attention mechanism. Experiments are conducted on three public
temporal interaction network datasets, and the experimental results show the
effectiveness of MRATE.

unlike its monolingual counterpart, the multilingual BERT model exhibits no
outlier dimension in its representations while it has a highly anisotropic
space. There are a few dimensions in the monolingual BERT with high
contributions to the anisotropic distribution. However, we observe no such
dimensions in the multilingual BERT. Furthermore, our experimental results
demonstrate that increasing the isotropy of multilingual space can
significantly improve its representation power and performance, similarly to
what had been observed for monolingual CWRs on semantic similarity tasks. Our
analysis indicates that, despite having different degenerated directions, the
embedding spaces in various languages tend to be partially similar with respect

provide fresh water for remote areas and emergencies. The energy efficiency and
productivity of conventional solar still are unsatisfying and need improvement,
which requires a deep understanding of the heat and mass transfer process in
solar still. In this work, the effect of the inner air circulation on the
system's heat and mass transfer performance and energy efficiency are studied
theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical results reveal that a weak
acceleration of the air circulation inside the SS will significantly increase
its performance, due to the improved mass transfer process. By enhancing the
inner air circulation, the evaporation and condensation in the solar still can
reach up to the limit, and the theoretical energy efficiency reaches up to 87%,
91.5%, and 94.5%, for the input power density at 300 W/m2, 500 W/m2, and 700
W/m2, respectively. Besides, lower ambient temperature and higher ambient
convective heat transfer coefficient will decrease the energy efficiency. Given
the heat loss, the experimental energy efficiencies are only 3% to 6% lower
than the theoretical results, which indicates that the great performance
predicted by the theory can be realized in practical application. This work
provides a new understanding and strategy for improving the performance of the

starts with experiments to understand the effect of LTR speech on
general-purpose ASR. LTR speech with reversed segment duration of 5 ms - 50 ms
is rendered and evaluated. For ASR training data augmentation with LTR speech,
training sets are created by combining natural speech with different partitions
of LTR speech. The efficacy of data augmentation is confirmed by ASR results on
speech corpora in various languages and speaking styles. ASR on LTR speech with
reversed segment duration of 15 ms - 30 ms is found to have lower error rate
than with other segment duration. Data augmentation with these LTR speech
achieves satisfactory and consistent improvement on ASR performance.

to lens subhaloes in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing observations, where these
perturbers can generate detectable image fluctuations. Previous studies have
calculated the detection limit of a line-of-sight small-mass dark halo by
comparing the lensing deflection angles it would cause, to those caused by a
subhalo within the lens. However, this overly simplifies the difference in
observational consequences between a subhalo and a line-of-sight halo.
Furthermore, it does not take into account degeneracies between an extra
subhalo and the uncertain properties of the main lens. More in keeping with
analyses of real-world observations, we regard a line-of-sight halo as
detectable only if adding it to a smooth model generates a statistically
significant improvement in the reconstructed image. We find that the number
density of detectable line-of-sight perturbers has been overestimated by as
much as a factor of two in the previous literature. For typical lensing
geometries and configurations, very deep imaging is sensitive to twice as many
line-of-sight perturbers as subhaloes, but moderate depth imaging is sensitive
to only slightly more line-of-sight perturbers than subhaloes.

features needs to handle new features in test data without further retraining.
The problem is of much significance for dealing with features incrementally
collected from different fields. To this end, we propose a new learning
paradigm with graph representation and learning. Our framework contains two
modules: 1) a backbone network (e.g., feedforward neural nets) as a lower model
takes features as input and outputs predicted labels; 2) a graph neural network
as an upper model learns to extrapolate embeddings for new features via message
passing over a feature-data graph built from observed data. Based on our
framework, we design two training strategies, a self-supervised approach and an
inductive learning approach, to endow the model with extrapolation ability and
alleviate feature-level over-fitting. We also provide theoretical analysis on
the generalization error on test data with new features, which dissects the
impact of training features and algorithms on generalization performance. Our
experiments over several classification datasets and large-scale advertisement
click prediction datasets demonstrate that our model can produce effective
embeddings for unseen features and significantly outperforms baseline methods
that adopt KNN and local aggregation.

in brain connectivity analysis. Typically, observations/samples are from
several heterogenous groups and the group membership of each observation/sample
is unavailable, which poses a great challenge for graph structure learning. In
this article, we propose a method which can achieve Simultaneous Clustering and
Estimation of Heterogeneous Graphs (briefly denoted as SCEHG) for
matrix-variate function Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. Unlike the
conventional clustering methods which rely on the mean differences of various
groups, the proposed SCEHG method fully exploits the group differences of
conditional dependence relationships among brain regions for learning cluster
structure. In essence, by constructing individual-level between-region network
measures, we formulate clustering as penalized regression with grouping and
sparsity pursuit, which transforms the unsupervised learning into supervised
learning. An ADMM algorithm is proposed to solve the corresponding optimization
problem. We also propose a generalized criterion to specify the number of
clusters. Extensive simulation studies illustrate the superiority of the SCEHG
method over some state-of-the-art methods in terms of both clustering and graph
recovery accuracy. We also apply the SCEHG procedure to analyze fMRI data
associated with ADHD (abbreviated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder), which illustrate its empirical usefulness. An R package ``SCEHG"" to

in an apparent resistance change with a large On/Off ratio > 104 and a

robustness of the center domain structure, the device exhibits the excellent
restoration repeatability over 106 cycles and a long retention over 12 days (>

description, usually denoted as zero-shot learning, is more prone to be used in
real-world scenarios when compared to traditional object recognition.
Nevertheless, no work has evaluated the feasibility of deploying zero-shot
learning approaches in these scenarios, particularly when using low-power
devices. In this paper, we provide the first benchmark on the inference time of
zero-shot learning, comprising an evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches
regarding their speed/accuracy trade-off. An analysis to the processing time of
the different phases of the ZSL inference stage reveals that visual feature
extraction is the major bottleneck in this paradigm, but, we show that
lightweight networks can dramatically reduce the overall inference time without
reducing the accuracy obtained by the de facto ResNet101 architecture. Also,
this benchmark evaluates how different ZSL approaches perform in low-power
devices, and how the visual feature extraction phase could be optimized in this
hardware. To foster the research and deployment of ZSL systems capable of
operating in real-world scenarios, we release the evaluation framework used in
this benchmark (https://github.com/CristianoPatricio/zsl-methods).

in the infrared for theories of gravity within Einstein-Hilbert action and
beyond. In particular, we will show that such an infrared length scale is
determined by the number of gravitons $N_{g}\gg1$ associated to a given mass in
the non-relativistic limit. After tracing out the matter degrees of freedom,
the graviton vacuum is found to be in a displaced vacuum with an occupation
number of gravitons $N_{g}\gg1$. In the infrared, the length scale appears to
be $L=\sqrt{N_{g}}\ell_{p}$, where $L$ is the new infrared length scale, and
$\ell_{p}$ is the Planck length. In a specific example, we have found that the
infrared length scale is greater than the Schwarzschild radius for a slowly
moving in-falling thin shell of matter. We will argue that the appearance of
such an infrared length scale in higher curvature theories of gravity, such as
in quadratic and cubic curvature theories of gravity, is also expected.
Furthermore, we will show that gravity is fundamentally different from the
electromagnetic interaction where the number of photons, $N_{p}$, is the fine
structure constant after tracing out an electron wave function.

barred massive disc galaxies. Massive spiral galaxies are already present as
early as $z=4$, and bar formation takes place already at those early times. The
bars grow longer and stronger as the host galaxies evolve, with the bar sizes
increasing at a pace similar to that of the disc scale lengths. The bar
fraction mildly evolves with redshift for galaxies with
$M_{*}\geq10^{10}M\odot$, being greater than $\sim40\%$ at $0.5<z<3$ and
$\sim30\%$ at $z=0$. When bars larger than a given physical size ($\geq 2\,\rm
kpc$) or the angular resolution limit of twice the I-band angular PSF FWHM of
the HST are considered, the bar fraction dramatically decreases with increasing
redshift, reconciling the theoretical predictions with observational data. We
find that barred galaxies have an older stellar population, lower gas fractions
and star formation rates than unbarred galaxies. In most cases, the discs of
barred galaxies assembled earlier and faster than the discs of unbarred
galaxies. We also find that barred galaxies are typical in haloes with larger
concentrations and smaller spin parameters than unbarred galaxies. Furthermore,
the inner regions of barred galaxies are more baryon-dominated than those of
unbarred galaxies but have comparable global stellar mass fractions. Our
findings suggest that the bar population could be used as a potential tracer of
the buildup of disc galaxies and their host haloes. With this paper, we release
a catalogue of barred galaxies in TNG50 at $6$ redshifts between $z=4$ and
$z=0$.

distribution of normal samples and detect outliers as anomalies in testing.
Meanwhile, the anomalies in real-world are usually subtle and fine-grained in a
high-resolution image especially for industrial applications. Towards this end,
we propose a novel framework for unsupervised anomaly detection and
localization. Our method aims at learning dense and compact distribution from
normal images with a coarse-to-fine alignment process. The coarse alignment
stage standardizes the pixel-wise position of objects in both image and feature
levels. The fine alignment stage then densely maximizes the similarity of
features among all corresponding locations in a batch. To facilitate the
learning with only normal images, we propose a new pretext task called
non-contrastive learning for the fine alignment stage. Non-contrastive learning
extracts robust and discriminating normal image representations without making
assumptions on abnormal samples, and it thus empowers our model to generalize
to various anomalous scenarios. Extensive experiments on two typical industrial
datasets of MVTec AD and BenTech AD demonstrate that our framework is effective
in detecting various real-world defects and achieves a new state-of-the-art in
industrial unsupervised anomaly detection.

an open-vocabulary setting. On downstream tasks, a carefully chosen text prompt

engineering, context optimization \cite{zhou2021coop} has been proposed to
learn continuous vectors as task-specific prompts with few-shot training

better vision-language models other than prompt tuning.~While prompt tuning is
for the textual inputs, we propose CLIP-Adapter to conduct fine-tuning with
feature adapters on either visual or language branch. Specifically,
CLIP-Adapter adopts an additional bottleneck layer to learn new features and
performs residual-style feature blending with the original pre-trained

optimization while maintains a simple design. Experiments and extensive
ablation studies on various visual classification tasks demonstrate the

external forces. The external loads are estimated in configuration space using
a momentum-based approach in order to reduce the calculation complexity, and
the adaptive back-stepping sliding mode (ABSM) controller is designed to guard
against uncertainties. Stability analysis is performed using Lyapunov theory
which guarantees not only the exponential stability of each state under the
designed control law, but also the global stability of the closed-loop system.
The system performance is benchmarked against other conventional control
methods, such as the sliding mode (SM) and inverse dynamics PD controllers. The
results show the effectiveness of the proposed variable impedance control in
stabilizing the position error and diminishing the impact of the external load
compared to SM and PD controllers.

knowledge from a large base dataset of common diseases and normal controls, and
transferring the knowledge to rare diseases. Yet, most existing methods require
the base dataset to be labeled and do not make full use of the precious

self-distillation of the knowledge about the rare diseases, composing a hybrid
approach taking advantages of both unsupervised and (pseudo-) supervised

that the DCE increases with the radial excitation level $n$. Also, a nontrivial
finding of this work is that the energy density associated with the bottomonium
quasinormal modes presents a singularity near the black hole horizon for some
combination of values of $T, eB$ and $n$. As we show here, it is possible to
separate the singular factor and define a square integrable quantity that

3$. The wave kinetic equation describes the effective dynamics of the second
moments of the Fourier modes of the NLS solution at the kinetic timescale, and
in the kinetic limit in which the size of the system diverges to infinity and
the strength of the nonlinearity vanishes asymptotically according to a
specified scaling law.
  Here, we investigate the behavior of the joint distribution of these Fourier
modes and derive their effective limit dynamics at the kinetic timescale. In
particular, we prove propagation of chaos in the wave setting: initially
independent Fourier modes retain this independence in the kinetic limit. Such
statements are central to the formal derivations of all kinetic theories,
dating back to the work of Boltzmann (Stosszahlansatz). We obtain this by
deriving the asymptotics of the higher Fourier moments, which are given by
solutions of the wave kinetic heirarchy (WKH) with factorized initial data. As
a byproduct, we also provide a rigorous justification of this hierarchy for
general (not necessarily factorized) initial data.
  We treat both Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial distributions. In the
Gaussian setting, we prove propagation of Gaussianity as we show that the
asymptotic distribution retains the Gaussianity of the initial data in the
limit. In the non-Gaussian setting, we derive the limiting equations for the
higher order moments, as well as for the density function (PDF) of the
solution. Some of the results we prove were conjectured in the physics
literature, others appear to be new. This gives a complete description of the
statistics of the solutions in the kinetic limit.

from classic SMPC where the probability that the state lies in the constraint

strict recursive feasibility is satisfied by assuming that the uncertainty is
supported by a compact set, the proposed concept of recursive feasibility for

Further, due to the intrinsic difference between categorical and continuous
label space, the common intuitions for classification, e.g., cluster
assumptions or pseudo labeling strategies, cannot be naturally adapted into
deep regression. To this end, we first delved into the existing data-efficient
methods in deep learning and found that they either encourage invariance to

relevant fields, but it has also limited the understanding of the complex
structural joint spatio-temporal dynamics of the human pose. Here we propose a
novel Space-Time-Separable Graph Convolutional Network (STS-GCN) for pose

with a graph convolutional network (GCN), including the temporal evolution and
the spatial joint interaction within a single-graph framework, which allows the
cross-talk of motion and spatial correlations. Concurrently, STS-GCN is the
first space-time-separable GCN: the space-time graph connectivity is factored
into space and time affinity matrices, which bottlenecks the space-time
cross-talk, while enabling full joint-joint and time-time correlations. Both
affinity matrices are learnt end-to-end, which results in connections

high parallax uncertainties that afflict the bright and red stars in EDR3, so

decrease of the self-diffusion coefficient at a low fluid density. With a
decreasing matrix porosity, this effect becomes weaker. For intermediate fluid
densities, the depletion contribution leads to an increase of the

sufficiently dense fluid, the self-diffusion coefficient strongly decreases due
to a hard sphere effect. The influence of the cluster size and the type of

previous efforts have been contributed to minimizing the empirical risk with
different parameter regularization terms and episodic memory, but rarely
exploring the usages of the weight loss landscape. In this paper, we
investigate the relationship between the weight loss landscape and
sensitivity-stability in the continual learning scenario, based on which, we
propose a novel method, Flattening Sharpness for Dynamic Gradient Projection
Memory (FS-DGPM). In particular, we introduce a soft weight to represent the
importance of each basis representing past tasks in GPM, which can be
adaptively learned during the learning process, so that less important bases
can be dynamically released to improve the sensitivity of new skill learning.
We further introduce Flattening Sharpness (FS) to reduce the generalization gap
by explicitly regulating the flatness of the weight loss landscape of all seen
tasks. As demonstrated empirically, our proposed method consistently
outperforms baselines with the superior ability to learn new skills while
alleviating forgetting effectively.

configuration that can significantly modify a compact object's structure and

  Intelligence",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep long-tailed learning, one of the most challenging problems in visual
recognition, aims to train well-performing deep models from a large number of
images that follow a long-tailed class distribution. In the last decade, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful recognition model for learning high-quality
image representations and has led to remarkable breakthroughs in generic visual
recognition. However, long-tailed class imbalance, a common problem in
practical visual recognition tasks, often limits the practicality of deep
network based recognition models in real-world applications, since they can be
easily biased towards dominant classes and perform poorly on tail classes. To
address this problem, a large number of studies have been conducted in recent
years, making promising progress in the field of deep long-tailed learning.
Considering the rapid evolution of this field, this paper aims to provide a
comprehensive survey on recent advances in deep long-tailed learning. To be
specific, we group existing deep long-tailed learning studies into three main
categories (i.e., class re-balancing, information augmentation and module
improvement), and review these methods following this taxonomy in detail.
Afterward, we empirically analyze several state-of-the-art methods by
evaluating to what extent they address the issue of class imbalance via a newly
proposed evaluation metric, i.e., relative accuracy. We conclude the survey by
highlighting important applications of deep long-tailed learning and
identifying several promising directions for future research.

research on explainability of deep learning models in healthcare have two major
limitations: using post-hoc explanations and using raw clinical variables as
units of explanation, both of which are often difficult for human
interpretation. In this work, we designed a self-explaining deep learning
framework using the expert-knowledge driven clinical concepts or intermediate
features as units of explanation. The self-explaining nature of our proposed
model comes from generating both explanations and predictions within the same
architectural framework via joint training. We tested our proposed approach on
a publicly available Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset for predicting
patient mortality in the ICU. In order to analyze the
performance-interpretability trade-off, we compared our proposed model with a
baseline having the same set-up but without the explanation components.
Experimental results suggest that adding explainability components to a deep
learning framework does not impact prediction performance and the explanations
generated by the model can provide insights to the clinicians to understand the
possible reasons behind patient mortality.

Here, we first propose a previously ignored principle of attribute-object

itself to classify attributes. Besides the compositions of single-attribute and

this is the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). FID assumes that images
featurized using the penultimate layer of Inception-v3 follow a Gaussian
distribution, an assumption which cannot be violated if we wish to use FID as a
metric. However, we show that Inception-v3 features of the ImageNet dataset are
not Gaussian; in particular, every single marginal is not Gaussian. To remedy
this problem, we model the featurized images using Gaussian mixture models
(GMMs) and compute the 2-Wasserstein distance restricted to GMMs. We define a
performance measure, which we call WaM, on two sets of images by using
Inception-v3 (or another classifier) to featurize the images, estimate two
GMMs, and use the restricted $2$-Wasserstein distance to compare the GMMs. We
experimentally show the advantages of WaM over FID, including how FID is more
sensitive than WaM to imperceptible image perturbations. By modelling the
non-Gaussian features obtained from Inception-v3 as GMMs and using a GMM
metric, we can more accurately evaluate generative network performance.

mainly relied on data from a large number of body locations which could

with mild stages of PD and healthy subjects performed non-steady-state circuit
trials comprising stairs, ramp, and changes of direction. An offline analysis
using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier and a Long-Short Term

performance of accelerographic and gyroscopic information from varied

Using LSTM, even a subset of information (e.g., feet data) in

employing LDA was shown to be at the expense of being limited to using a

satellite constellation as a means to alleviate the problem of the digital
connectivity divide in the global south. First, the paper discusses the issues
of digital connectivity in education in rural Sri Lanka and other countries in
the global south. Then, the paper gives an introduction to Starlink broadband
internet technology and discusses its advantages over traditional technologies.
After that, the paper discusses a possible mechanism of adopting Starlink
technology as a solution to the rural digital connectivity problem in the
global south. Technological, as well as economical aspects of such scheme, are
discussed. Finally, challenges that may arise in deploying a system such as
Starlink to improve rural digital connectivity in Sri Lanka or any another
country in the global south will be discussed with possible remedies.

with increasing public interest and concern. This paper draws on literature
from public policy and governance to make two contributions. First, we propose
an AI accountability ecosystem as a useful lens on the system, with different
stakeholders requiring and contributing to specific accountability mechanisms.
We argue that the present ecosystem is unbalanced, with a need for improved
transparency via AI explainability and adequate documentation and process
formalisation to support internal audit, leading up eventually to external
accreditation processes. Second, we use a case study in the gambling sector to
illustrate in a subset of the overall ecosystem the need for industry-specific
accountability principles and processes. We define and evaluate critically the
implementation of key accountability principles in the gambling industry,
namely addressing algorithmic bias and model explainability, before concluding
and discussing directions for future work based on our findings. Keywords:

exploring the spectral shifts of the fiber transmitted spectrum due to the
curvature-induced mode field distributions' displacements, we demonstrate a
multi-axis bending sensor. In the proposed sensor, curvature radii and angles

conveniently adjusting empirical functions to the sensor response. Evaluation

medical imaging and wearable electronics due to the advantages such as low
cost, good biocompatibility, and good flexibility. Photomultiplication OPDs
(PM-OPDs) enabled by the trap-assisted carrier tunneling injection effect
exhibit external quantum efficiencies far greater than unity, thus the acquired
responsivities are extremely high. However, the reported PM-OPDs with high
responsivity performances are all accompanied by high dark currents due to the
introduction of carrier traps, which inevitably results in inferior
detectivities. In this work, we modify a P3HT:PCBM donor-rich PM-OPD by
introducing an atomically thin Al2O3 interfacial layer through the ALD
technique, obtaining a high responsivity of 8294 A/W and high detectivity of
6.76*10^14 Jones, simultaneously, both of which are among the highest reported
for bulk heterojunction PM-OPDs. Ascribed to the introduction of the atomically
thin Al2O3 layer, the metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) tunneling junction is
formed, which brings forward a suppressed dark current along with an increased
amounts of holes tunneling under forward bias. Meanwhile, the weak light
detection limit of the modified PM-OPD within the linear response range reaches
the level of nW/cm2. Based on the proposed PM-OPD, a proof-of-concept image
sensor with 26*26 pixels is demonstrated, which can respond to both ultraviolet
light and visible light. The PM-OPD based sensor arrays can find broad
applications for medical imaging, wearable electronics, etc.

forecasting its motions in the following one- or two-wave cycles, which helps
improve the performance of a motion compensation system and provides useful
early warning information. In this study, we extend a deep learning (DL) model,
which could predict the heave and surge motions of a floating semi-submersible
20 to 50 seconds ahead with good accuracy, to quantify its uncertainty of the
predictive time series with the help of the dropout technique. By repeating the
inference several times, it is found that the collection of the predictive time
series is a Gaussian process (GP). The DL model with dropout learned a kernel
inside, and the learning procedure was similar to GP regression. Adding noise
into training data could help the model to learn more robust features from the
training data, thereby leading to a better performance on test data with a wide
noise level range. This study extends the understanding of the DL model to
predict the wave excited motions of an offshore platform.

  Safety-Critical Applications","49 pages",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  There has been a growing interest in deep learning-based prognostic and
health management (PHM) for building end-to-end maintenance decision support
systems, especially due to the rapid development of autonomous systems.
However, the low trustworthiness of PHM hinders its applications in
safety-critical assets when handling data from an unknown distribution that
differs from the training dataset, referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD)
dataset. To bridge this gap, we propose an uncertainty-informed framework to
diagnose faults and meanwhile detect the OOD dataset, enabling the capability
of learning unknowns and achieving trustworthy fault diagnosis. Particularly,
we develop a probabilistic Bayesian convolutional neural network (CNN) to
quantify both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in fault diagnosis. The
fault diagnosis model flags the OOD dataset with large predictive uncertainty
for expert intervention and is confident in providing predictions for the data
within tolerable uncertainty. This results in trustworthy fault diagnosis and
reduces the risk of erroneous decision-making, thus potentially avoiding
undesirable consequences. The proposed framework is demonstrated by the fault
diagnosis of bearings with three OOD datasets attributed to random number
generation, an unknown fault mode, and four common sensor faults, respectively.
The results show that the proposed framework is of particular advantage in
tackling unknowns and enhancing the trustworthiness of fault diagnosis in
safety-critical applications.

Till now, more than 20 vaccines have been approved by the World Health

promotion of COVID-19 vaccination around the world also brings a lot of
discussions on social media about different aspects of vaccines, such as

we conduct an in-depth analysis of tweets related to the coronavirus vaccine on
Twitter to understand the trending topics and their corresponding sentimental
polarities regarding the country and vaccine levels. The results show that a
majority of people are confident in the effectiveness of vaccines and are
willing to get vaccinated. In contrast, the negative tweets are often
associated with the complaints of vaccine shortages, side effects after
injections and possible death after being vaccinated. Overall, this study

the reaction, conversion, etc.) was introduced around 100 years ago. Most of
the literature provides a definition for the exceptional case of a single
reaction step or gives an implicit definition that cannot be made explicit.
There are views that the reaction extent somehow has to tend to 1 when the
reaction goes to completion as time tends to infinity. However, there is no
agreement on which function should tend to 1. Starting from the standard
definition by IUPAC and following the classical works by De Donder, Aris, and
Croce we extend the classic definition of the reaction extent for an arbitrary
number of species and reaction steps. The new general, explicit definition is
also valid for non-mass action kinetics. We also studied the mathematical
properties (evolution equation, continuity, monotony, differentiability, etc.)
of the defined quantity, connecting them to the formalism of modern reaction
kinetics. Our approach tries to adhere to the customs of chemists and be
mathematically correct simultaneously. To make the exposition easy to
understand, we use simple chemical examples and many figures, throughout. We
also show how to apply this concept to exotic reactions: reactions with more
than one stationary state, oscillatory reactions, and reactions showing chaotic
behavior. The main advantage of the new definition of reaction extent is that
by knowing the kinetic model of a reacting system one can now calculate not
only the time evolution of the concentration of each reacting species but also
the number of occurrences of the individual reaction events.
