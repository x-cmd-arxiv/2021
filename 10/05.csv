detect since it remains asymptomatic until the symptoms are severe. Thus,
diagnosis is usually possible until the markers are easy to identify, i.e., the
damage has already occurred. Early identification of glaucoma is generally made
based on functional, structural, and clinical assessments. However, due to the
nature of the disease, researchers still debate which markers qualify as a
consistent glaucoma metric. Deep learning methods have partially solved this
dilemma by bypassing the marker identification stage and analyzing high-level
information directly to classify the data. Although favorable, these methods
make expert analysis difficult as they provide no insight into the model
discrimination process. In this paper, we overcome this using deep generative
networks, a deep learning model that learns complicated, high-dimensional
probability distributions. We train a Deep Feature consistent Variational

small-sized latent space obtained from the DFC-VAE can learn the
high-dimensional glaucoma data distribution and provide discriminatory evidence
between normal and glaucoma eyes. Latent representations of size as low as 128

inability to take into account information of various modalities, for instance
the impact of maintenance downtime on traffic flows. This is the issue we
address in this paper. Specifically, we propose a novel model to predict
traffic speed under the impact of construction work. The model is based on the
powerful attention-based spatio-temporal graph convolution architecture but
utilizes various channels to integrate different sources of information,
explicitly builds spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states, captures
the relationships between heterogeneous roadway networks, and then predicts
changes in traffic flow resulting from maintenance downtime events. The model
is evaluated on two benchmark datasets and a novel dataset we have collected
over the bustling Tyson's corner region in Northern Virginia. Extensive
comparative experiments and ablation studies show that the proposed model can
capture complex and nonlinear spatio-temporal relationships across a
transportation corridor, outperforming baseline models.

in the production of energetic electrons during solar flares and the
non-thermal broadening of spectral lines is a key sign of this turbulence.
Here, we determine how flare turbulence evolves in time and space using
spectral profiles of Fe xxiv, Fe xxiii and Fe xvi, observed by Hinode/EIS. Maps
of non-thermal velocity are created for times covering the X-ray rise, peak,
and decay. For the first time, the creation of kinetic energy density maps
reveal where energy is available for energization, suggesting that similar
levels of energy may be available to heat and/or accelerate electrons in large
regions of the flare. We find that turbulence is distributed throughout the
entire flare; often greatest in the coronal loop tops, and decaying at
different rates at different locations. For hotter ions (Fe xxiv and Fe xxiii),
the non-thermal velocity decreases as the flare evolves and during/after the
X-ray peak shows a clear spatial variation decreasing linearly from the loop
apex towards the ribbon. For the cooler ion (Fe xvi), the non-thermal velocity
remains relativity constant throughout the flare, but steeply increases in one
region corresponding to the southern ribbon, peaking just prior to the peak in
hard X-rays before declining. The results suggest turbulence has a more complex
temporal and spatial structure than previously assumed, while newly introduced
turbulent kinetic energy maps show the availability of the energy and identify
important spatial inhomogeneities in the macroscopic plasma motions leading to
turbulence.

study reveals important factors to engineer the THz emission amplitude and
bandwidth in epitaxial Pt/Fe emitters grown on MgO and MgAl$_2$O$_4$ (MAO)
substrates, where the choice of the substrate plays an important role. The THz
amplitude and bandwidth are affected by the induced strain in the Fe spin
source layer. On the one hand, the THz electric field amplitude is found to be
larger when Pt/Fe is grown on MgO even though the crystalline quality of the Fe
film is superior when grown on MAO. This is because of the larger defect
density, smaller electron relaxation time, and lower electrical conductivity in
the THz regime when Fe is grown on MgO. On the other hand, the bandwidth is
found to be larger for Pt/Fe grown on MAO and is explained by the
uncoupled/coupled Lorentz oscillator models. This study provides an insightful
pathway to further engineer metallic spintronic THz emitters in terms of the

difficulties due to function approximation errors from out-of-distribution

or a penalty term that explicitly guides the policy to stay close to the given
dataset. However, prior methods typically require accurate estimation of the
behavior policy or sampling from OOD data points, which themselves can be a
non-trivial problem. Moreover, these methods under-utilize the generalization
ability of deep neural networks and often fall into suboptimal solutions too
close to the given dataset. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-based
offline RL method that takes into account the confidence of the Q-value
prediction and does not require any estimation or sampling of the data

increasing the number of Q-networks along with the clipped Q-learning. Based on

that it is in fact $\sim$40$^{\prime\prime}$ away from WR 85, indicating no

clearly resolves a number of emission lines, such as N Ly$\alpha$, O
Ly$\alpha$, Fe XVIII, Ne X, Mg XI, and Si XIII. The spectrum can be well
represented by an absorbed thermal emission model with a temperature of $k_{\rm

ejected when the progenitor star evolved into a red supergiant. The abundance
ratio of N to O is obtained to be $\rm N/O =
6.8_{-2.1}^{+2.5}\left(N/O\right)_{\odot}$. By comparing this to those in outer

their geometrical design, granularity and absorption depth, with respect to the

a space mission. CaloCube is an homogeneous calorimeter whose basic geometry is
cubic and isotropic, obtained by filling the cubic volume with small cubic

from every direction in space, thus maximizing the acceptance. This design
summarizes a three-year R&D activity, aiming to both optimize and study the

were seen across the primary squat musculature (excluding biceps femoris),

so-called treewidth, which is closely related to the connectivity of a given
linear-optical circuit. Using the algorithms, we study approximated simulations
for local Haar-random linear-optical circuits. For equally spaced initial
sources, we show that when the circuit depth is less than the quadratic in the
lattice spacing, the efficient simulation is possible with an exponentially
small error. Notably, right after this depth, photons start to interfere each
other and the algorithms' complexity becomes sub-exponential in the number of
sources, implying that there is a sharp transition of its complexity. Finally,
when a circuit is sufficiently deep enough for photons to typically propagate
to all modes, the complexity becomes exponential as generic sampling
algorithms. We numerically implement a likelihood test with a recent Gaussian
boson sampling experiment and show that the treewidth-based algorithm with a
limited treewidth renders a larger likelihood than the experimental data.

Most of these models predict that less than $\sim \! 10^{47} \, {\rm erg}$ is

last week of stellar evolution. This translates to CSM masses less than $\sim

too small to greatly impact the light curves or spectra of the subsequent
supernovae, except perhaps during the shock breakout phase. However, a few
models predict somewhat higher wave energy fluxes, for which we perform
hydrodynamical simulations of the mass ejection process. Radiative transfer
simulations of the subsequent supernovae predict a bright but brief

contact tracing technologies to curb the spread of the disease by locating and
isolating people who have been in contact with coronavirus carriers.
Subsequently, understanding why people install and use contact tracing apps is
becoming central to their effectiveness and impact. This paper analyzes
situations where centralized mass surveillance technologies are deployed
simultaneously with a voluntary contact tracing mobile app. We use this
parallel deployment as a natural experiment that tests how attitudes toward
mass deployments affect people's installation of the contact tracing app. Based
on a representative survey of Israelis (n=519), our findings show that positive
attitudes toward mass surveillance were related to a reduced likelihood of
installing contact tracing apps and an increased likelihood of uninstalling
them. These results also hold when controlling for privacy concerns about the
contact tracing app, attitudes toward the app, trust in authorities, and

ordering was via mechanical rotations between the layers, with the periodicity
of the resulting moir\'e pattern being directly related to twist angle. Here we
report a fundamentally new mechanism for emergence of mesoscopic periodic
patterns in multilayer sulfur-containing metal phosphorous trichalcogenide,
MnPS$_{3}$, induced by the electron beam. The formation under the beam of
periodic hexagonal patterns with several characteristic length scales,
nucleation and transitions between the phases, and local dynamics are
demonstrated. The associated mechanisms are attributed to the relative
contraction of the layers caused by beam-induced sulphur vacancy formation with
subsequent ordering and lattice parameter change. As a result, the plasmonic
response of the system is locally altered, suggesting an element of control
over plasmon resonances by electron beam patterning. We pose that harnessing
this phenomenon provides both insight into fundamental physics of quantum
materials and opens a pathway towards device applications by enabling
controlled periodic potentials on the atomic scale.

identity-dependent face shape (IDFS) of a human face to target face images
where the context (e.g., facial expressions, head poses, and other background
factors) may change dramatically. Human faces are non-rigid, so facial
expression leads to deformation of face shape, and head pose also affects the
face observed in 2D images. A key challenge in face transfer is to match the
face with unobserved new contexts, adapting the face appearance to different
poses and expressions accordingly. In this work, we find a way to provide prior
knowledge for generative models to reason about the appropriate appearance of a
human face in response to various expressions and poses. We propose a novel
context-aware face transfer method, called CarTrans, that incorporates causal
effects of contextual factors into face representation, and thus is able to be
aware of the uncertainty of new contexts. We estimate the effect of facial
expression and head pose in terms of counterfactual inference by designing a
controlled intervention trial, thus avoiding the requirement of a large number
of observations to cover the pose-expression space well. Moreover, we propose a
kernel regression-based encoder that eliminates the identity specificity of

A and B using the three most prominent broad emission lines (H$\alpha$,

lines we analyzed if microlensing was present in the continuum source. We
obtained MBH using the single-epoch method with the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
emission lines from the monochromatic luminosity and the velocity width. The
luminosity at 3000 \r{A} was obtained using the Spectral Energy Distribution
(SED) of image A while the luminosity at 5100 \r{A} was estimated directly from
the spectra. The average MBH between the images obtained was $\rm

similar to those measured in the literature for unlensed low-luminosity
quasars. Microlensing of -0.16 $\pm$ 0.06 mag. in the continuum was found but
the induced error in the MBH is minor compared to the one associated to the
macromodel magnification. We also obtained the accretion disk size using the

theoretical challenge is to compute the dark matter scattering rate in
experimental targets, and to find materials with large scattering rates. In
this paper we point out that, if dark matter scatters through a mediator that
couples to EM charge, then electromagnetic sum rules place limits on the
achievable scattering rates. These limits serve as a useful sanity check for
calculations, as well as setting a theoretical target for proposed detection
methods. Motivated by this analysis, we explore how conductor-dielectric
heterostructures can result in enhanced scattering rates compared to bulk
conductors, for dark matter masses $\lesssim$ MeV. These effects could be
especially important in computing the scattering rates from thin-film targets,
e.g. superconducting detectors such as SNSPDs, TESs or MKIDs, for which the
scattering rate could be enhanced by orders of magnitude at low enough dark
matter masses, as well as introducing or enhancing directional dependence.

From the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices of the monomer
wavefunctions obtained by the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), we compute
SAPT contributions to the interaction energy [SAPT(VQE)]. At first order, this
energy yields the electrostatic and exchange contributions for non-covalently
bound systems. We empirically find from ideal statevector simulations that the
SAPT(VQE) interaction energy components display orders of magnitude lower
absolute errors than the corresponding VQE total energies. Therefore, even with
coarsely optimized low-depth VQE wavefunctions, we still obtain sub kcal/mol
accuracy in the SAPT interaction energies. In SAPT(VQE), the quantum
requirements, such as qubit count and circuit depth, are lowered by performing
computations on the separate molecular systems. Furthermore, active spaces
allow for large systems containing thousands of orbitals to be reduced to a
small enough orbital set to perform the quantum portions of the computations.
We benchmark SAPT(VQE) (with the VQE component simulated by ideal state-vector
simulators) against a handful of small multi-reference dimer systems and the

question and passage encoder in a bi-encoder design. Previous work on
generalization of DPR mainly focus on testing both encoders in tandem on

domain adaptation. However, it is still unknown how DPR's individual
question/passage encoder affects generalization. Specifically, in this paper,
we want to know how an in-distribution (IND) question/passage encoder would
generalize if paired with an OOD passage/question encoder from another domain.
We refer to this challenge as \textit{encoder adaptation}. To answer this
question, we inspect different combinations of DPR's question and passage
encoder learned from five benchmark QA datasets on both in-domain and
out-of-domain questions. We find that the passage encoder has more influence on
the lower bound of generalization while the question encoder seems to affect
the upper bound in general. For example, applying an OOD passage encoder
usually hurts the retrieval accuracy while an OOD question encoder sometimes
even improves the accuracy.

their HI disks, either inwards or outwards, without any clear increase in
magnitude in the outermost regions, as we would expect for continuous radial
accretion. Gas mass flow rates for most galaxies are less than 1 M$_\odot$/yr.
Over the entire sample, we estimated an average inflow rate of 0.3 M$_\odot$/yr

coupling two spin 1 systems using both numerical and analytical methods.
Furthermore, we consider a concrete realization of spin 1 systems using a
superconducting circuit. This realization includes non-standard spin-spin
interaction terms that may endanger the topological properties. We argue
however that the realistic circuit Hamiltonian including all terms should be
expected to show the rich phase structure as well. This puts our theoretical

gravitational waves, low-latency and full parameter estimation skymaps, and a

five new kilonovae independently discovered by WINTER during O4, given a
realistic BNS merger rate. Using a larger grid of kilonova parameters, we find
that kilonova emission is $\approx$2 times longer-lived and red kilonovae are
detected $\approx$1.5 times further in the infrared than in the optical. For
90% localization areas smaller than 150 (450) $\rm{deg}^{2}$, WINTER will be
sensitive to more than 10% of the kilonova model grid out to 350 (200) Mpc. We

better CLEAN reconstructions of simulated images of evolved stars with complex

nature of the synthesized beam still persists with both robust and natural
weightings in the Rev D configuration and continues to limit the image fidelity
of image reconstructions with non-uniform weighting. The RML methods show
stable performance that is resilient to different array configurations with
image quality comparable to or better than CLEAN methods in the presented
simulation, consistent with our previous work. Our simulation results suggest
that the Rev D configuration will provide a better deconvolution beam compared

more extended in Ly$\alpha$. Our data suggest that Ly$\alpha$ bright galaxies
appear rounder in their Ly$\alpha$ morphology, and there is less of a

a strong sensitivity to the source model. We show that the effects of these two

both in merging clusters on scales of Mpc, called giant radio haloes, and in
relaxed systems with a cool-core on smaller scales, named mini haloes. Giant
radio haloes and mini haloes are thought to be distinct classes of sources.
However, recent observations have revealed the presence of diffuse radio
emission on Mpc scales in clusters that do not show strong dynamical activity.
RX J1720.1+2638 is a cool-core cluster, presenting both a bright central mini
halo and a fainter diffuse, steep-spectrum emission extending beyond the
cluster core that resembles giant radio halo emission. In this paper, we
present new observations performed with the LOFAR Low Band Antennas (LBA) at 54
MHz. These observations, combined with data at higher frequencies, allow us to
constrain the spectral properties of the radio emission. The large-scale
emission presents an ultra-steep spectrum with $\alpha_{54}^{144}\sim3.2$. The
radio emission inside and outside the cluster core have strictly different
properties, as there is a net change in spectral index and they follow
different radio-X-ray surface brightness correlations. We argue that the
large-scale diffuse emission is generated by particles re-acceleration after a
minor merger. While for the central mini halo we suggest that it could be
generated by secondary electrons and positrons from hadronic interactions of
relativistic nuclei with the dense cool-core gas, as an alternative to
re-acceleration models.

in their birth cluster plays a vital role in their evolution. Previous
modelling assumes that the disc behaves like a classical Keplerian accretion
disc out to a radius where the photoevaporative outflow is launched. There is
then an abrupt change in the angular velocity profile, and the outflow is
modelled by forcing the fluid parcels to conserve their specific angular
momenta. Instead, we model externally photoevaporating discs using the slim
disc formalism. The slim disc approach self consistently includes the advection
of radial and angular momentum as well as angular momentum redistribution by
internal viscous torques. Our resulting models produce a smooth transition from
a rotationally supported Keplerian disc to a photoevaporative driven outflow,
where this transition typically occurs over ~4-5 scale heights. The penetration
of UV photons predominately sets the radius of the transition and the
viscosity's strength plays a minor role. By studying the entrainment of dust
particles in the outflow, we find a rapid change in the dust size and surface
density distribution in the transition region due to the steep gas density
gradients present. This rapid change in the dust properties leaves a
potentially observable signature in the continuum spectral index of the disc at
mm wavelengths. Using the slim disc formalism in future evolutionary
calculations will reveal how both the gas and dust evolves in their outer
regions and the observable imprints of the external photoevaporation process.

are not precisely self-similar and an additional parameter, beyond their

mass density profiles. We present, for the first time, a model to consistently
predict both halo concentration, $c$, and this additional `shape' parameter,
$\alpha$, for a halo of given mass and redshift for a specified cosmology.
Following recent studies, we recast the dependency on mass, redshift, and
cosmology to a dependence on `peak height'. We show that, when adopting the
standard definition of peak height, which employs the so-called spherical top
hat (STH) window function, the concentration--peak height relation has a strong
residual dependence on cosmology (i.e., it is not uniquely determined by peak
height), whereas the $\alpha$--peak height relation is approximately universal
when employing the STH window function. Given the freedom in the choice of
window function, we explore a simple modification of the STH function,
constraining its form so that it produces universal relations for concentration
and $\alpha$ as a function of peak height using a large suite of cosmological
simulations. It is found that universal relations for the two density profile
parameters can indeed be derived and that these parameters are set by the
linear power spectrum, $P(k)$, filtered on different scales. We show that the
results of this work generalise to any (reasonable) combination of $P(k)$ and
background expansion history, $H(z)$, resulting in accurate predictions of the

cosmological simulation to analyze the circumgalactic O VI gas around

observations do not reveal where the gas lies along the line-of-sight, we
compare the O VI measurements produced by gas within fixed distances around
galaxies and by gas selected using line-of-sight velocity cuts commonly adopted
by observers. We show that gas selected by a velocity cut of $\pm300$ km
s$^{-1}$ or $\pm500$ km s$^{-1}$ produces a higher O VI column density, a
flatter column density profile, and a higher covering fraction compared to gas
within one, two, or three times the virial radius ($r_\mathrm{vir}$) of
galaxies. The discrepancy increases with impact parameter and worsens for lower
mass galaxies. For example, compared to the gas within 2$r_\mathrm{vir}$,
identifying the gas using velocity cuts of 200-500 km s$^{-1}$ increases the O
VI column density by 0.2 dex (0.1 dex) at 1$r_\mathrm{vir}$ to over 0.75 dex

$10^{9}$-$10^{9.5}$ $\rm M_\odot$ ($10^{10}$-$10^{10.5}$ $\rm M_\odot$). We
furthermore estimate that excluding O VI outside $r_\mathrm{vir}$ decreases the
circumgalactic oxygen mass measured by Tumlinson et al. (2011) by over 50%. Our
results demonstrate that gas at large line-of-sight separations but selected by
conventional velocity windows has significant effects on the O VI measurements

correlations between the delay time and black hole mass by means of the suite
of binary population synthesis simulations, COMPAS. We distinguish two
channels: the common envelope (CE), and the stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF)
channel, characterised by whether the system has experienced a common envelope
or not. We find that the CE channel preferentially produces BHs with masses
below about $30\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and short delay times ($t_{\rm delay} \lesssim
1$Gyr), while the stable RLOF channel primarily forms systems with BH masses
above $30\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and long delay times ($t_{\rm delay} \gtrsim 1$Gyr).
We provide a new fit for the metallicity specific star-formation rate density
based on the Illustris TNG simulations, and use this to convert the delay time
distributions into a prediction of $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$. This leads to a
distinct redshift evolution of $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$ for high and low primary
BH masses. We furthermore find that, at high redshift, $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$ is
dominated by the CE channel, while at low redshift it contains a large
contribution ($\sim 40\%$) from the stable RLOF channel. Our results predict
that, for increasing redshifts, BBHs with component masses above
$30\rm{M}_{\odot}$ will become increasingly scarce relative to less massive BBH
systems. Evidence of this distinct evolution of $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$ for
different BH masses can be tested with future detectors.

two different semi-classical approaches, the self-consistent Gaussian

range of validity of these widely used approaches. We show that the
self-consistent approximation is strongly limited in comparison to the
truncated Hamiltonian method which for larger cutoffs is practically exact for
the parameter range studied. We find that the self-consistent approximation is
only valid when the effective mass is in the vicinity of the renormalised mass.
Similarly to the self-consistent approximation, the truncated Wigner
approximation is not able to capture the correct mass renormalisation, and
breaks down for strong enough interactions where the bare mass becomes
negative. We attribute the failure of TWA to the presence of a classical

for various computer vision applications. However, advances in deep generative

known as deepfakes, causing a threat to privacy, democracy, and national
security. Most of the current deepfake detection methods are deemed as a binary
classification problem in distinguishing authentic images or videos from fake
ones using two-class convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods are
based on detecting visual artifacts, temporal or color inconsistencies produced
by deep generative models. However, these methods require a large amount of
real and fake data for model training and their performance drops significantly
in cross dataset evaluation with samples generated using advanced deepfake
generation techniques. In this paper, we thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of
deep face recognition in identifying deepfakes, using different loss functions
and deepfake generation techniques. Experimental investigations on challenging
Celeb-DF and FaceForensics++ deepfake datasets suggest the efficacy of deep
face recognition in identifying deepfakes over two-class CNNs and the ocular
modality. Reported results suggest a maximum Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.98 and
an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 7.1% in detecting deepfakes using face recognition
on the Celeb-DF dataset. This EER is lower by 16.6% compared to the EER
obtained for the two-class CNN and the ocular modality on the Celeb-DF dataset.
Further on the FaceForensics++ dataset, an AUC of 0.99 and EER of 2.04% were
obtained. The use of biometric facial recognition technology has the advantage
of bypassing the need for a large amount of fake data for model training and
obtaining better generalizability to evolving deepfake creation techniques.

that the soft polar phonon hybridizes with spin-flip electronic excitations of

objects present in the initial frame of a video at the pixel level. To fully
exploit the appearance information of an object, pixel-level feature matching
is widely used in VOS. Conventional feature matching runs in a surjective
manner, i.e., only the best matches from the query frame to the reference frame
are considered. Each location in the query frame refers to the optimal location
in the reference frame regardless of how often each reference frame location is
referenced. This works well in most cases and is robust against rapid
appearance variations, but may cause critical errors when the query frame
contains background distractors that look similar to the target object. To
mitigate this concern, we introduce a bijective matching mechanism to find the
best matches from the query frame to the reference frame and vice versa. Before
finding the best matches for the query frame pixels, the optimal matches for
the reference frame pixels are first considered to prevent each reference frame
pixel from being overly referenced. As this mechanism operates in a strict
manner, i.e., pixels are connected if and only if they are the sure matches for
each other, it can effectively eliminate background distractors. In addition,
we propose a mask embedding module to improve the existing mask propagation
method. By embedding multiple historic masks with coordinate information, it
can effectively capture the position information of a target object.

in the limited-data setting. Overfitting is a common problem here. The standard
approaches to prevent overfitting are dimensionality reduction and
regularization. But dimensionality reduction loses information, while
regularization requires the user to choose a norm, or a prior, or a distance
metric. We propose an algorithm called RoLin that needs no user choice and
applies to a large class of loss functions. RoLin combines reliable information
from the top principal components with a robust optimization to extract any
useful information from unreliable subspaces. It also includes a new robust
cross-validation that is better than existing cross-validation methods in the
limited-data setting. Experiments on $25$ real-world datasets and three
standard loss functions show that RoLin broadly outperforms both dimensionality
reduction and regularization. Dimensionality reduction has $14\%-40\%$ worse
test loss on average as compared to RoLin. Against $L_1$ and $L_2$
regularization, RoLin can be up to 3x better for logistic loss and 12x better
for squared hinge loss. The differences are greatest for small sample sizes,
where RoLin achieves the best loss on 2x to 3x more datasets than any competing
method. For some datasets, RoLin with $15$ training samples is better than the
best norm-based regularization with $1500$ samples.

loop group, i.e. the Fr\'echet Lie group of smooth maps from the 2-torus to

space of vector valued $L^2$-functions on the 2-torus. The purpose of this
paper is to construct a higher central extension of the smooth double loop
group from the representation of the smooth double loop group on H induced by a
smooth action of $\Gamma$ on V. This higher central extension comes from an
action of the smooth double loop group on a 2-category and yields a group
cohomology class of degree 3 on the smooth double loop group. We show by a
concrete computation that this group cohomology class is non-trivial in
general. We relate our higher central extension to the Kac-Moody extension of
the smooth single loop group as a higher dimensional analogue of the latter.
More generally, given a group G acting on a bipolarised Hilbert space, we apply
higher category theory to construct a group cohomology class of degree 3 on G.
As a second motivating example, we use these ideas to introduce a higher
central extension of the group of invertible smooth functions on the

the acoustic pressure time series is a more feasible modality for data

estimate the difference in observed and unobserved outcomes for a potential
treatment, known as the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). However,
CATE corresponds to the comparison on the first moment alone, and as such may
be insufficient in reflecting the full picture of treatment effects. As an
alternative, estimating the full potential outcome distributions could provide
greater insights. However, existing methods for estimating treatment effect
potential outcome distributions often impose restrictive or simplistic
assumptions about these distributions. Here, we propose Collaborating Causal
Networks (CCN), a novel methodology which goes beyond the estimation of CATE
alone by learning the full potential outcome distributions. Estimation of
outcome distributions via the CCN framework does not require restrictive
assumptions of the underlying data generating process. Additionally, CCN
facilitates estimation of the utility of each possible treatment and permits
individual-specific variation through utility functions. CCN not only extends
outcome estimation beyond traditional risk difference, but also enables a more
comprehensive decision-making process through definition of flexible
comparisons. Under assumptions commonly made in the causal literature, we show
that CCN learns distributions that asymptotically capture the true potential
outcome distributions. Furthermore, we propose an adjustment approach that is
empirically effective in alleviating sample imbalance between treatment groups
in observational data. Finally, we evaluate the performance of CCN in multiple
synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments. We demonstrate that CCN learns
improved distribution estimates compared to existing Bayesian and deep
generative methods as well as improved decisions with respects to a variety of
utility functions.

perturbation suppression by magnetic tension are shown to be misleading, as
they do not include the most unstable dimension. For perturbation modes along
the applied field direction, the magnetic field simultaneously reduces ablative
stabilization and adds magnetic tension stabilization; the stabilizing term is
found to dominate for applied fields >5T, with both effects increasing in
importance at short wavelengths. For modes perpendicular to the applied field,
magnetic tension does not directly stabilize the perturbation, but can result
in moderately slower growth due to the perturbation appearing 2-D (albeit in a
different orientation to 2-D ICF simulations). In cases where thermal ablative
stabilization is dominant the applied field increases the peak bubble-spike
height. Resistive diffusion is shown to be important for short wavelengths and
long timescales, reducing the effectiveness of tension stabilization.

fulfillment decisions that can be used to efficiently predict most likely
assignments for future decisions. Essentially, those assignments that can be
predicted with high confidence can be used to shortcut, or bypass, the

state, is a standard assumption across all of the physical sciences. The Gibbs
state is determined just by temperature and the system's energies alone. But at
decreasing system sizes, i.e. for nanoscale and quantum systems, the
interaction with their environments is not negligible. The question then
arises: Is the system's steady state still the Gibbs state? And if not, how may
the steady state depend on the interaction details? Here we provide an overview
of recent progress on answering these questions. We expand on the
state-of-the-art along two general avenues: First we take the static
point-of-view which postulates the so-called mean force Gibbs state. This view
is commonly adopted in the field of strong coupling thermodynamics, where
modified laws of thermodynamics and non-equilibrium fluctuation relations are
established on the basis of this modified state. Second, we take the dynamical
point-of-view, originating from the field of open quantum systems, which
examines the time-asymptotic steady state within two paradigms. We describe the
mathematical paradigm which proves return to equilibrium, i.e. convergence to
the mean force Gibbs state, and then discuss a number of microscopic physical
methods, particularly master equations. We conclude with a summary of
established links between statics and equilibration dynamics, and provide an
extensive list of open problems. This comprehensive overview will be of

within the large program ""Gas phase Elemental abundances in Molecular CloudS""
(GEMS) towards 66 positions across 12 starless cores in the Taurus Molecular
Cloud. A non-LTE radiative transfer code was used to compute the column
densities in all positions. We then used state-of-the-art chemical models to
reproduce our observations. We have computed N(CH$_3$OH)/N(C$^{18}$O) column
density ratios for all the observed offsets, and two different behaviours can
be recognised: the cores where the ratio peaks at the dust peak, and the cores
where the ratio peaks with a slight offset with respect to the dust peak ($\sim
$10000 AU). We suggest that the cause of this behaviour is the irradiation on
the cores due to protostars nearby which accelerate energetic particles along
their outflows. The chemical models, which do not take into account irradiation
variations, can reproduce fairly well the overall observed column density of
methanol, but cannot reproduce the two different radial profiles observed. We
confirm the substantial effect of the environment onto the distribution of
methanol in starless cores. We suggest that the clumpy medium generated by
protostellar outflows might cause a more efficient penetration of the

multiple-access channels (MACs) for the total communication rate. Furthermore,
for optical communication modelled as phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian MACs,
we prove that the optimal total rate is achieved by Gaussian entanglement and
therefore can be efficiently evaluated. To benchmark entanglement's advantage,
we propose computable outer bounds for the capacity region without entanglement

from internal dark matter (DM) velocity dispersions, which in turn can be
observationally inferred from satellite galaxy velocities. However, galaxies
are biased tracers of the DM, and the bias can vary over host halo and galaxy
properties as well as time. We precisely calibrate the velocity bias, b_v --
defined as the ratio of galaxy and DM velocity dispersions -- as a function of
redshift, host halo mass, and galaxy stellar mass threshold (Mstarsat), for
massive halos (M200c > 1e13.5 msun) from five cosmological simulations:
IllustrisTNG, Magneticum, Bahamas + Macsis, The Three Hundred Project, and
MultiDark Planck-2. We first compare scaling relations for galaxy and DM
velocity dispersion across simulations; the former is estimated using a new
ensemble velocity likelihood method that is unbiased for low galaxy counts per
halo, while the latter uses a local linear regression. The simulations show
consistent trends of b_v increasing with M200c and decreasing with redshift and
Mstarsat. The ensemble-estimated theoretical uncertainty in b_v is 2-3% but
becomes percent-level when considering only the three highest resolution
simulations. We update the mass-richness normalization previously estimated by
Farahi et al. (2016) for an SDSS redMaPPer cluster sample. The improved
accuracy of our b_v estimates reduces the mass normalization uncertainty from
22% to 8%, demonstrating that dynamical estimation techniques can be
competitive with weak lensing in calibrating population mean masses. We discuss
necessary steps for further improving this precision. Our estimates for

gauge theory scattering amplitudes: individual webs contribute to the logarithm
of the amplitude and their ultraviolet renormalization encodes its infrared
structure. In this paper, we consider the particular class of boomerang webs,
consisting of multiple gluon exchanges, but where at least one gluon has both
of its endpoints on the same Wilson line. First, we use the replica trick to
prove that diagrams involving self-energy insertions along the Wilson line do
not contribute to the web, i.e. their exponentiated colour factor vanishes.
Consequently boomerang webs effectively involve only integrals where boomerang
gluons straddle one or more gluons that connect to other Wilson lines. Next we
classify and calculate all boomerang webs involving semi-infinite non-lightlike
Wilson lines up to three-loop order, including a detailed discussion of how to
regulate and renormalize them. Furthermore, we show that they can be written
using a basis of specific harmonic polylogarithms, that has been conjectured to
be sufficient for expressing all multiple gluon exchange webs. However,
boomerang webs differ from other gluon-exchange webs by featuring a lower and
non-uniform transcendental weight. We cross-check our results by showing how
certain boomerang webs can be determined by the so-called collinear reduction
of previously calculated webs. Our results are a necessary ingredient of the
soft anomalous dimension for non-lightlike Wilson lines at three loops.

formation), $s$-process elements (which probe AGB nucleosynthesis at
intermediate delay times), and iron-peak elements (which probe delayed Type Ia

  theoretical analysis and a solution method","35 pages, 11 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Support vector classification (SVC) is a classical and well-performed
learning method for classification problems. A regularization parameter, which
significantly affects the classification performance, has to be chosen and this
is usually done by the cross-validation procedure. In this paper, we
reformulate the hyperparameter selection problem for support vector
classification as a bilevel optimization problem in which the upper-level
problem minimizes the average number of misclassified data points over all the
cross-validation folds, and the lower-level problems are the l1-loss SVC
problems, with each one for each fold in T-fold cross-validation. The resulting
bilevel optimization model is then converted to a mathematical program with
equilibrium constraints (MPEC). To solve this MPEC, we propose a global
relaxation cross-validation algorithm (GR-CV) based on the well-know
Sholtes-type global relaxation method (GRM). It is proven to converge to a
C-stationary point. Moreover, we prove that the MPEC-tailored version of the
Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ), which is a key property
to guarantee the convergence of the GRM, automatically holds at each feasible
point of this MPEC. Extensive numerical results verify the efficiency of the
proposed approach. In particular, compared with other methods, our algorithm
enjoys superior generalization performance over almost all the data sets used
in this paper.

can shape the radio wave propagation and thus offers a great variety of
possible performance and implementation gains. Motivated by this, we
investigate the achievable sum-rate optimization in a broadcast channel (BC) in
the presence of RISs. We solve this problem by exploiting the well-known
duality between the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) BC and the
multiple-access channel (MAC), and we correspondingly derive three algorithms
which optimize the users' covariance matrices and the RIS phase shifts in the
dual MAC. The users' covariance matrices are optimized by a dual decomposition
method with block coordinate maximization (BCM), or by a gradient-based method.
The RIS phase shifts are either optimized sequentially by using a closed-form
expression, or are computed in parallel by using a gradient-based method. We
present a computational complexity analysis for the proposed algorithms.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms tend to converge to the
same achievable sum-rate overall, but may produce different sum-rate
performance for some specific situations, due to the non-convexity of the
considered problem. Also, the gradient-based optimization methods are generally
more time efficient. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms
can provide a significant gain in the RIS-assisted BC assisted by multiple RISs
and that the gain depends on the placement of the RISs.

structurally critical parts of the coral reef framework can lead to physical
habitat collapse on an ecosystem scale, reducing the potential for biodiversity
support. The mechanism underpinning crumbling and collapse of corals can be
described via a combination of laboratory-scale experiments and mathematical
and computational models. We synthesise data from electron back-scatter
diffraction, micro-computed tomography, and micromechanical experiments,
supplemented by molecular dynamics and continuum micromechanics simulations to
predict failure of coral structures under increasing porosity and dissolution.
Results reveal remarkable mechanical properties of cold-water coral skeletons
of 462 MPa compressive strength and 45-67 GPa stiffness. This is 10 times
stronger than concrete, twice as strong than ultrahigh performance fibre
reinforced concrete, or nacre. Contrary to what would be expected, CWCs
skeletons retain their strength despite a loss of stiffness and even when
synthesised under future oceanic conditions. Our models capture the impact of
corrosive waters on exposed skeletons and illustrate how small modifications in
their skeleton lead to significantly increased risk of crumbling coral habitat.
This new understanding, combined with projections of how seawater chemistry
will change over the coming decades, will help support future conservation and

ecosystems are at risk and when they will be at risk, allowing assessment of
the impact upon associated biodiversity.

issue which only grows as the complexity of the coupling increases. Therefore,
there exists an opportunity to leverage the abilities of computer software in
order to algorithmically perform these calculations on-demand. This paper
outlines the details of such a software, implemented in C++ using in-built
libraries. The software is capable of accepting invariant couplings involving
an arbitrary number of $\mathsf{SO(10)}$ Higgs tensors, each having up to 5
indices. The output is then produced in \LaTeX, so that it is universally
readable and sufficiently expressive. Through the use of this software,
$\mathsf{SO(10)}$ coupling analysis can be performed in a way that minimizes
calculation time, eliminates errors, and allows for experimentation with
couplings that have not been computed before in the literature. Furthermore,
this software can be expanded in the future to account for similar Higgs-Spinor
coupling analysis, or extended to include further $\mathsf{SO(N)}$ invariant
couplings.

are strongly related, and we can predict the global dust properties from the
integrated UV to mid-infrared emission with the help of machine learning
techniques. We investigate if these machine learning techniques can also be
extended to resolved scales. Our aim is to predict resolved maps of the
specific dust luminosity, specific dust mass, and dust temperature starting
from a set of surface brightness images from UV to mid-infrared wavelengths. We
used a selection of nearby galaxies retrieved from the DustPedia sample, in
addition to M31 and M33. These were convolved and resampled to a range of pixel
sizes, ranging from 150 pc to 3 kpc. We trained a random forest model which
considers each pixel individually. We find that the predictions work well on
resolved scales, with the dust mass and temperature having a similar root mean
square error as on global scales (0.32 dex and 3.15 K on 18"" scales
respectively), and the dust luminosity being noticeably better (0.11 dex). We
find no significant dependence on the pixel scale. Predictions on individual
galaxies can be biased, and we find that about two-thirds of the scatter can be
attributed to scatter between galaxies (rather than within galaxies). A machine
learning approach can be used to create dust maps, with its resolution being
only limited to the input bands, thus achieving a higher resolution than
Herschel. These dust maps can be used to improve global estimates of dust
properties, they can lead to a better estimate of dust attenuation, and they
can be used as a constraint on cosmological simulations that trace dust.

used in the scanning transmission electron microscope. It relates the spatial

case of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), frame-based hyperspectral
acquisition is much slower than the achievable rastering time of the scan unit
(SU), which sometimes leads to undesirable effects in the sample, such as
electron irradiation damage, that goes unperceived during frame acquisition. In
this work, we have developed an event-based hyperspectral EELS by using a
Timepix3 application-specific integrated circuit detector with two
supplementary time-to-digital (TDC) lines embedded. In such a system, electron
events are characterized by their positional and temporal coordinates, but TDC
events only by temporal ones. By sending reference signals from the SU to the
TDC line, it is possible to reconstruct the entire spectral image with
SU-limited scanning pixel dwell time and thus acquire, with no additional cost,
a hyperspectral image at the same rate as that of a single channel detector,
such as annular dark-field. To exemplify the possibilities behind event-based
hyperspectral EELS, we have studied the decomposition of calcite (CaCO$_3$)

interactions between a seller and a buyer, how a seller can gradually learn
optimal pricing decisions based on the buyer's past purchase responses. A
fundamental challenge of learning in such a strategic setup is that the buyer
will naturally have incentives to manipulate his responses in order to induce
more favorable learning outcomes for him. To understand the limits of the
seller's learning when facing such a strategic and possibly manipulative buyer,
we study a natural yet powerful buyer manipulation strategy. That is, before
the pricing game starts, the buyer simply commits to ""imitate"" a different
value function by pretending to always react optimally according to this
imitative value function.
  We fully characterize the optimal imitative value function that the buyer
should imitate as well as the resultant seller revenue and buyer surplus under
this optimal buyer manipulation. Our characterizations reveal many useful
insights about what happens at equilibrium. For example, a seller with concave
production cost will obtain essentially 0 revenue at equilibrium whereas the
revenue for a seller with convex production cost is the Bregman divergence of
her cost function between no production and certain production. Finally, and
importantly, we show that a more powerful class of pricing schemes does not
necessarily increase, in fact, may be harmful to, the seller's revenue. Our
results not only lead to an effective prescriptive way for buyers to manipulate
learning algorithms but also shed lights on the limits of what a seller can
really achieve when pricing in the dark.

are fundamentally memory-bound. For such workloads, data movement between
memory and CPU cores imposes a significant overhead in terms of both latency
and energy. A major reason is that this communication happens through a narrow
bus with high latency and limited bandwidth, and the low data reuse in
memory-bound workloads is insufficient to amortize the cost of memory access.
Fundamentally addressing this data movement bottleneck requires a paradigm
where the memory system assumes an active role in computing by integrating
processing capabilities. This paradigm is known as processing-in-memory (PIM).
Recent research explores different forms of PIM architectures, motivated by the
emergence of new technologies that integrate memory with a logic layer, where
processing elements can be easily placed. Past works evaluate these
architectures in simulation or, at best, with simplified hardware prototypes.
In contrast, the UPMEM company has designed and manufactured the first

bus resonator induces a state-dependent phase shift on the qubits equivalent to
an effective $ZZ$ interaction. In principle, the dispersive nature of the gate
offers flexibility for qubit parameters. However, the drive can cause resonator
and qubit leakage, the physics of which cannot be fully captured using either
the existing Jaynes-Cummings or Kerr models. In this paper, we adopt an
ab-initio model based on Josephson nonlinearity for transmon qubits. The
ab-initio analysis agrees well with the Kerr model in terms of capturing the
effective $ZZ$ interaction in the weak-drive dispersive regime. In addition,
however, it reveals numerous leakage transitions involving high-excitation
qubit states. We analyze the physics behind such novel leakage channels,
demonstrate the connection with specific qubits-resonator frequency collisions,
and lay out a plan towards device parameter optimization. We show this type of
leakage can be substantially suppressed using very weakly anharmonic transmons.
In particular, weaker qubit anharmonicity mitigates both collision density and
leakage amplitude, while larger qubit frequency moves the collisions to occur
only at large anharmonicity not relevant to experiment. Our work is broadly
applicable to the physics of weakly anharmonic transmon qubits coupled to
linear resonators. In particular, our analysis confirms and generalizes the
measurement-induced state transitions noted in Sank et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett.

automatically detect different patterns from the driver and vehicle data. In
this paper, we propose a methodology to understand changes in driver's
physiological responses within different driving patterns. Our methodology
first decomposes a driving scenario by using a Bayesian Change Point detection
model. We then apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method on both driver
state and behavior data to detect patterns. We present two case studies in
which vehicles were equipped to collect exterior, interior, and driver
behavioral data. Four patterns of driving behaviors (i.e., harsh brake, normal
brake, curved driving, and highway driving), as well as two patterns of
driver's heart rate (HR) (i.e., normal vs. abnormal high HR), and gaze entropy
(i.e., low versus high), were detected in these two case studies. The findings
of these case studies indicated that among our participants, the drivers' HR
had a higher fraction of abnormal patterns during harsh brakes, accelerating
and curved driving. Additionally, free-flow driving with close to zero
accelerations on the highway was accompanied by more fraction of normal HR as
well as a lower gaze entropy pattern. With the proposed methodology we can
better understand variations in driver's psychophysiological states within
different driving scenarios. The findings of this work, has the potential to
guide future autonomous vehicles to take actions that are fit to each specific

stochastic behavior of input data using the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. These
novel features are constructed by applying a coordinate transformation based on
the recent Functional Data Analysis theory for anomaly detection. The
associated signal decomposition is an exact hierarchical tensor product
expansion with known optimality properties for approximating stochastic
processes (random fields) with finite dimensional function spaces. In principle
these low dimensional spaces can capture most of the stochastic behavior of
`underlying signals' in a given nominal class, and can reject signals in
alternative classes as stochastic anomalies. Using a hierarchical finite
dimensional expansion of the nominal class, a series of orthogonal nested
subspaces is constructed for detecting anomalous signal components. Projection
coefficients of input data in these subspaces are then used to train a Machine
Learning (ML) classifier. However, due to the split of the signal into nominal
and anomalous projection components, clearer separation surfaces of the classes
arise. In fact we show that with a sufficiently accurate estimation of the
covariance structure of the nominal class, a sharp classification can be
obtained. This is particularly advantageous for situations with large
unbalanced datasets. We formulate this concept and demonstrate it on a number
of high-dimensional datasets in cancer diagnostics. This approach yields
significant increases in accuracy over ML methods that use the original feature
data. This method leads to a significant increase in precision and accuracy
over the current top benchmarks for the Global Cancer Map (GCM) gene expression

which are young ($<$2 Myr), mid-age (2-6 Myr), and old ($>$6 Myr) groups, and
stacked the WISE 12 and 22 and the AKARI 90 $\mu$m images in each group. The
photometry of the stacked image shows the flux decay timescales of 1.4$\pm$0.2,
1.38$\pm$0.05, and 1.4$^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$ Myr in the 12, 22, and 90 $\mu$m bands,

the 12 and 22 $\mu$m fluxes are attributed to the emission from the
intermediate ($\sim$ 1 au) region and the 90 $\mu$m flux corresponds to that
from the outer ($\sim$ 10 au) region in the disk. We hence conclude the dust
dissipation timescale is $\tau_{\rm med,dust}\sim$1.4 Myr in the intermediate
disks and is $\tau_{\rm outer, dust}=$1.4$^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$ Myr in the outer

energy hubs and buildings' energy management systems can result in higher
energy savings. This paper investigates how different MPC strategies perform on
energy management systems in buildings and energy hubs. We first discuss two
MPC approaches; centralized and decentralized. While the centralized control
strategy offers optimal performance, its implementation is computationally
prohibitive and raises privacy concerns. On the other hand, the decentralized
control approach, which offers ease of implementation, displays significantly
lower performance. We propose a third strategy, distributed control based on
dual decomposition, which has the advantages of both approaches. Numerical case
studies and comparisons demonstrate that the performance of distributed control
is close to the performance of the centralized case, while maintaining a
significantly lower computational burden, especially in large-scale scenarios
with many agents. Finally, we validate and verify the reliability of the

acoustics and electromagnetism is the circulator, which achieves unirotational
transmission through a network of ports. This work investigates an elastic wave
circulator composed of a thin elastic ring with three semi-infinite elastic
waveguides attached, creating a three-port network. Nonreciprocity is achieved
for both longitudinal and transverse waves by modulating the elastic modulus of
the ring in a rotating fashion. Two numerical models are derived and
implemented to compute the elastic wave field in the circulator. The first is
an approximate model based on coupled mode theory, which makes use of the known
mode shapes of the unmodulated system. The second model is a finite element
approach that includes a Fourier expansion in the harmonics of the modulation
frequency and radiation boundary conditions at the ports. The coupled mode
model shows excellent agreement with the finite element model and the
conditions on the modulation parameters that enable a high degree of
nonreciprocity are presented. This work demonstrates that it is possible to
create an elastic wave circulator that enables nonreciprocal mode-splitting of
an incident longitudinal wave into outgoing longitudinal and transverse waves.

multi-aspect textual reviews, particularly, their total effects on business

We calculate explicitly the two-spin energy spectrum, which describes all
possible energetic configurations of two spins pointing in a specific direction
embedded in a background of spins with opposite orientation. For fast decay of
the spin-spin couplings, we find that the two-spin energy spectrum is
characterized by well-defined discrete values, corresponding to bound states,
separated by a set of continuum states describing the scattering region. In the
deep long-range regime instead, the bound states disappear as they get
incorporated by the scattering region. The presence of two-spin bound states
results to be crucial to determine both two- and many-spin dynamics. On one
hand, radically different two-spin spreadings can be observed by tuning the
decay of the spin couplings. On the other hand, two-spin bound states enable
the dynamical stabilization of effective antiferromagnetic states in the
presence of ferromagnetic couplings. Finally, we propose a novel scheme based
on a trapped-ion quantum simulator to experimentally realize the long-range XXZ

images with only normal images in the training set. Most existing methods solve
this problem with a self-reconstruction framework, which tends to learn an
identity mapping and reduces the sensitivity to anomalies. To mitigate this
problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Proxy-bridged Image Reconstruction
Network (ProxyAno) for anomaly detection in medical images. Specifically, we
use an intermediate proxy to bridge the input image and the reconstructed
image. We study different proxy types, and we find that the superpixel-image
(SI) is the best one. We set all pixels' intensities within each superpixel as
their average intensity, and denote this image as SI. The proposed ProxyAno
consists of two modules, a Proxy Extraction Module and an Image Reconstruction
Module. In the Proxy Extraction Module, a memory is introduced to memorize the
feature correspondence for normal image to its corresponding SI, while the
memorized correspondence does not apply to the abnormal images, which leads to
the information loss for abnormal image and facilitates the anomaly detection.
In the Image Reconstruction Module, we map an SI to its reconstructed image.
Further, we crop a patch from the image and paste it on the normal SI to mimic
the anomalies, and enforce the network to reconstruct the normal image even
with the pseudo abnormal SI. In this way, our network enlarges the
reconstruction error for anomalies. Extensive experiments on brain MR images,
retinal OCT images and retinal fundus images verify the effectiveness of our
method for both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection.

theories where this could occur is in weakly-gauged holographic models (dual to

couplings are indeed enhanced towards the UV boundary of the 5D AdS space.
However, contrary to expectations, we show that small instantons in these
non-asymptotically-free models are highly suppressed and ineffective. This is
due to the conservation of topological charge that forbids instantons to be
localized near the UV boundary. Despite this fact we find non-trivial UV
localized instanton-anti-instanton solutions of the Yang-Mills equations where
the topological charges annihilate in the AdS bulk. These analytic solutions
arise from a 5D conformal transformation of the uplifted 4D instanton. Our

We then develop a method called Deep Kernel Shaping (DKS), which accomplishes
this using a combination of precise parameter initialization, activation
function transformations, and small architectural tweaks, all of which preserve
the model class. In our experiments we show that DKS enables SGD training of
residual networks without normalization layers on Imagenet and CIFAR-10
classification tasks at speeds comparable to standard ResNetV2 and Wide-ResNet
models, with only a small decrease in generalization performance. And when
using K-FAC as the optimizer, we achieve similar results for networks without

functions, including those which traditionally perform very badly, such as the
logistic sigmoid. In addition to DKS, we contribute a detailed analysis of skip

The match between the far-infrared filaments and those detected at other

the same large-scale galactic wind that has produced the other structures in
this object. A closer look at the central 10 kpc x 10 kpc region provides
additional support for this scenario. The dust temperatures traced by the

many applications ranging from business intelligence to self-driving cars.
These methods require a complex computation pipeline consisting of various

post-processing the dataset, and matrix operations for core model computations.
Many existing systems focus on efficiently processing matrix-only operations,
and assume that the inputs to the relational operators are already pre-computed
and are materialized as intermediate matrices. However, the input to a
relational operator may be complex in machine learning pipelines, and may
involve various combinations of matrix operators. Hence, it is critical to
realize scalable and efficient relational query processors that directly
operate on big matrix data. This paper presents new efficient and scalable
relational query processing techniques on big matrix data for in-memory
distributed clusters. The proposed techniques leverage algebraic transformation
rules to rewrite query execution plans into ones with lower computation costs.
A distributed query plan optimizer exploits the sparsity-inducing property of
merge functions as well as Bloom join strategies for efficiently evaluating
various flavors of the join operation. Furthermore, optimized partitioning
schemes for the input matrices are developed to facilitate the performance of
join operations based on a cost model that minimizes the communication
overhead.The proposed relational query processing techniques are prototyped in
Apache Spark. Experiments on both real and synthetic data demonstrate that the
proposed techniques achieve up to two orders of magnitude performance
improvement over state-of-the-art systems on a wide range of applications.

built that integrates concepts and methods from a wide range of fields. The
information schism between the real-world and that which can be gathered and
considered by any individual information processing agent is characterized and
discussed, followed by the presentation of a series of the adopted requisites
while developing the modeling approach. The issue of mapping from datasets into
models is subsequently addressed, as well as some of the respectively implied
difficulties and limitations. Based on these considerations, an approach to
meta modeling how models are built is then progressively developed. First, the
reference M* meta model framework is presented, which relies critically in
associating whole datasets and respective models in terms of a strict
equivalence relation. Among the interesting features of this model are its
ability to bridge the gap between data and modeling, as well as paving the way
to an algebra of both data and models which can be employed to combine models
into hierarchical manner. After illustrating the M* model in terms of patterns
derived from regular lattices, the reported modeling approach continues by
discussing how sampling issues, error and overlooked data can be addressed,
leading to the $M^{<\epsilon>}$ variant, illustrated respectively to number
theory. The situation in which the data needs to be represented in terms of
respective probability densities is treated next, yielding the $M^{<\sigma>}$
meta model, which is then illustrated respectively to a real-world dataset
(iris flowers data). Several considerations about how the developed framework
can provide insights about data clustering, complexity, collaborative research,
deep learning, and creativity are then presented, followed by overall
conclusions.

large amount of pixel-level labeled data. To alleviate the data scarcity
problem presented in the real world, one could utilize synthetic data whose
label is easy to obtain. Previous work has shown that the performance of a
semantic segmentation model can be improved by training jointly with real and
synthetic examples with a proper weighting on the synthetic data. Such
weighting was learned by a heuristic to maximize the similarity between
synthetic and real examples. In our work, we instead learn a pixel-level
weighting of the synthetic data by meta-learning, i.e., the learning of
weighting should only be minimizing the loss on the target task. We achieve
this by gradient-on-gradient technique to propagate the target loss back into
the parameters of the weighting model. The experiments show that our method
with only one single meta module can outperform a complicated combination of an
adversarial feature alignment, a reconstruction loss, plus a hierarchical
heuristic weighting at pixel, region and image levels.

term in the leading-order field-induced interobject interaction between two
polar objects. This term arises when a real graviton is scattered by the same
object center with coupling between the two objects occurring via the exchange
of a single virtual graviton, and the interaction is thus relevant to the
number density of gravitons, the frequency and polarization of the external

to the existence of such an additional term, the field-induced quantum
gravitational interaction between two polar objects can be significantly
different from that between nonpolar ones when the interobject distance is much
smaller than the wavelength of the external gravitational radiation field.
Although we model the external gravitational radiation as a quantized

similar to the sparsity of the human brain, which drives research on functional

will be used for each input. Experimental results show that MoEfication can
conditionally use 10% to 30% of FFN parameters while maintaining over 95%

MoEfication brings two advantages: (1) it significantly reduces the FLOPS of

and interaction Lagrangians were adopted from the works of Pascalutsa and
Vrancx et al. The unknown parameters in the amplitudes, i.e., the coupling
constants and hadronic form factor cutoffs, were obtained by fitting the
calculated observables to experimental data. In the $K\Lambda$ channels the
inclusion of $N(2600)I_{1,11}$ and $N(2700)K_{1,13}$ resonances improves the
agreement between model calculations and experimental data significantly and
reduces the dominance of resonances in the model by increasing the hadronic
form factor cutoff of the Born terms. Furthermore, the inclusion of these
resonances reduces the number of resonance structures in cross sections,
including the structure in the $K^0\Lambda$ differential cross section at
$W\approx 1650$ MeV, which could become a hint of the narrow resonance. In the
$K\Sigma$ channels the inclusion of $N(2600)I_{1,11}$, $N(2700)K_{1,13}$,

reveals that the second and third peaks in the $K^+\Sigma^0$ differential cross

First proposed by Landau, scattering by phonons can lead to a composite entity

with larger effective mass. While this is the traditional view of polarons, the
rise of 2D systems, especially strongly correlated ones, open the prospect of
electron scattering taking on a larger role in spontaneous carrier localization
for such material systems. Here, we show that in transition metal halides, such
electron-electron interactions can lead to polaron formation even in the
absence of lattice distortion. This suggests an alternative direction for
polaron formation, transport, and control in solids. This new mechanism of
polaron formation is confirmed by first-principles calculation of 2D transition

supported by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements of

history of research. While recent work in spatiotemporal prediction has
leveraged deep sequential models that substantially improve over classical

extremely sparse, as in the task of crime event prediction. To overcome these
sparsity issues, we present Multi-axis Attentive Prediction for Sparse Event
Data (MAPSED). We propose a purely attentional approach to extract both
short-term dynamics and long-term semantics of event propagation through two
observation angles. Unlike existing temporal prediction models that propagate
latent information primarily along the temporal dimension, the MAPSED
simultaneously operates over all axes (time, 2D space, event type) of the
embedded data tensor. We additionally introduce a novel Frobenius norm-based
contrastive learning objective to improve latent representational
generalization.Empirically, we validate MAPSED on two publicly accessible urban

outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art deep learning models. The
proposed contrastive learning objective significantly enhances the MAPSED's
ability to capture the semantics and dynamics of the events, resulting in
better generalization ability to combat sparse observations.

developing foot ulcer that usually leads to limb amputation. In order to
develop a self monitoring mobile application, in this work, we propose a novel
deep subspace analysis pipeline for semi-supervised diabetic foot ulcer
mulit-label classification. To avoid any chance of over-fitting, unlike recent
state of the art deep semi-supervised methods, the proposed pipeline dose not
include any data augmentation. Whereas, after extracting deep features, in
order to make the representation shift invariant, we employ variety of data
augmentation methods on each image and generate an image-sets, which is then
mapped into a linear subspace. Moreover, the proposed pipeline reduces the cost
of retraining when more new unlabelled data become available. Thus, the first
stage of the pipeline employs the concept of transfer learning for feature
extraction purpose through modifying and retraining a deep convolutional
network architect known as Xception. Then, the output of a mid-layer is
extracted to generate an image set representer of any given image with help of
data augmentation methods. At this stage, each image is transferred to a linear
subspace which is a point on a Grassmann Manifold topological space. Hence, to
perform analyse them, the geometry of such manifold must be considered. As
such, each labelled image is represented as a vector of distances to number of
unlabelled images using geodesic distance on Grassmann manifold. Finally,
Random Forest is trained for multi-label classification of diabetic foot ulcer
images. The method is then evaluated on the blind test set provided by DFU2021
competition, and the result considerable improvement compared to using
classical transfer learning with data augmentation.

and low bias-voltage, the drift of the SiPM gain with temperature is a severe
problem for GRD performance. An adaptive voltage supply source was designed to
automatically adjust the SiPM bias voltage to compensate the temperature
effects and keep the gain stable. This approach has been proved to be effective
during both the on-ground and in-flight tests. The in-flight measured variation
of the SiPM gain is within 2%. To reduce the gain non-uniformity of GRDs, an
iterative bias voltage adjustment approach is proposed and implemented. The

gains. These systems, however, typically rely on optical fiber based fronthaul
for the communication between the central processing unit (CPU) and the
distributed access points (APs), which increases the infrastructure cost, leads
to high installation time, and limits the deployment flexibility and
adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two
architectures for cell-free massive MIMO systems based on wireless fronthaul
that is operating at a \textit{higher-band} compared to the access links: (i) A
wireless-only fronthaul architecture where the CPU has a wireless fronthaul
link to each AP, and (ii) a mixed-fronthaul architecture where the CPU has a
wireless link to each cluster of APs that are connected together via optical
fibers. These dual-band architectures ensure high-data rate fronthaul and
provide high capability to synchronize the distributed APs. Further, the
wireless fronthaul reduces the infrastructure cost and installation time, and
enhances the flexibility, adaptability, and scalability of the network
deployment. To investigate the achievable data rates with the proposed
architectures, we formulate the end-to-end data rate optimization problem
accounting for the various practical aspects of the fronthaul and access links.
Then, we develop a low-complexity yet efficient joint beamforming and resource
allocation solution for the proposed architectures based on user-centric AP
grouping. With this solution, we show that the proposed architectures can
achieve comparable data rates to those obtained with optical fiber-based
fronthaul under realistic assumptions on the fronthaul bandwidth, hardware
constraints, and deployment scenarios. This highlights a promising path for
realizing the cell-free massive MIMO gains in practice while reducing the
infrastructure and deployment overhead.

second-harmonic Hall resistance of Ni81Fe19/IrO2 bilayers, we find both
dampinglike and fieldlike SOTs. The former is larger than the latter, enabling
easier control of magnetization. We also observe that the dampinglike SOT
efficiency has a significant dependence on IrO2 thickness, which is well
described by the drift-diffusion model based on the bulk spin Hall effect. We
deduce the effective spin Hall angle of +0.093 +- 0.003 and the spin-diffusion
length of 1.7 +- 0.2 nm. By comparison with control samples Pt and Ir, we show
that the effective spin Hall angle of IrO2 is comparable to that of Pt and
seven times higher than that of Ir. The fieldlike SOT efficiency has a negative
sign without appreciable dependence on the thickness, in contrast to the
dampinglike SOT. This suggests that the fieldlike SOT likely stems from the
interface. These experimental findings suggest that the uniqueness of the
electronic structure of 5d transition-metal oxides is crucial for highly
efficient charge to spin-current conversion.

Perhaps more importantly, results obtained under such well-controlled, pristine

detection, health monitoring, fault diagnosis, and sensor network event
detection. The isolation forest (or iForest) approach is a well-known technique
for detecting anomalies. It is, however, ineffective when dealing with dynamic
streaming data, which is becoming increasingly prevalent in a wide variety of
application areas these days. In this work, we extend our previous work by
proposed an efficient iForest based approach for anomaly detection using cube
sampling that is effective on streaming data. Cube sampling is used in the
initial stage to choose nearly balanced samples, significantly reducing storage
requirements while preserving efficiency. Following that, the streaming nature
of data is addressed by a sliding window technique that generates consecutive
chunks of data for systematic processing. The novelty of this paper is in
applying Cube sampling in iForest and calculating inclusion probability. The
proposed approach is equally successful at detecting anomalies as existing
state-of-the-art approaches, requiring significantly less storage and time
complexity. We undertake empirical evaluations of the proposed approach using
standard datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms traditional approaches in
terms of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) and can handle high-dimensional
streaming data.

suppressed by strain or chemical doping effects giving rise to well-documented
first and second-order regimes, but the origin of the order change is unclear.
Here, we show that slow oxidation of monodisperse Fe3O4 nanoparticles leads to
an intriguing variation of the Verwey transition that elucidates the doping

leads to an initial drop to TV minima as low as 70 K after 45-75 days, followed
by recovery to a constant value of 95 K after 160 days that persists in all
experiments for aging times up to 1070 days. A physical model based on both
doping and doping-gradient effects accounts quantitatively for this evolution
and demonstrates that the persistent 95 K value corresponds to the lower limit
for homogenously doped magnetite and hence for the first order regime. In
comparison, further suppression down to 70 K results from inhomogeneous strains
that characterize the second-order region. This work demonstrates that slow
reactions of nanoparticles can give exquisite control and separation of
homogenous and inhomogeneous doping or strain effects on an nm scale and offers
opportunities for similar insights into complex electronic and magnetic phase

attacks against video classification models have been largely understudied.
This could be possible because, with video, the temporal dimension poses
significant additional challenges in gradient estimation. Query-efficient
black-box attacks rely on effectively estimated gradients towards maximizing
the probability of misclassifying the target video. In this work, we
demonstrate that such effective gradients can be searched for by parameterizing
the temporal structure of the search space with geometric transformations.
Specifically, we design a novel iterative algorithm Geometric TRAnsformed
Perturbations (GEO-TRAP), for attacking video classification models. GEO-TRAP
employs standard geometric transformation operations to reduce the search space
for effective gradients into searching for a small group of parameters that
define these operations. This group of parameters describes the geometric
progression of gradients, resulting in a reduced and structured search space.
Our algorithm inherently leads to successful perturbations with surprisingly
few queries. For example, adversarial examples generated from GEO-TRAP have
better attack success rates with ~73.55% fewer queries compared to the
state-of-the-art method for video adversarial attacks on the widely used Jester
dataset. Overall, our algorithm exposes vulnerabilities of diverse video
classification models and achieves new state-of-the-art results under black-box
settings on two large datasets. Code is available here:

create an IOT device to detect sign boards and also able to com-municate with
the traffic light and makes way for ambulance. Implementation is done by
detecting sign boards and measuring speed of vehicle using arduino and RF
transmitter which transmits the specific beep sound to specific type of
application like speed breaker, school zone etc. The vehicle also contains RF
receiver and arduino, which starts receiving the beep sound when near to sign
board. After receiving the code, arduino starts measuring the current speed of
vehicle and if the speed is above recommended speed then it starts gives alert.
If the vehicle speed is not reduced even after the alert then the vehicle will
auto break. With the help of this Traffic Management System (TMS), we can
record the number of users who do not reduce vehicle speed even when prompted
by the system alerts.

modularization tackles this problem by learning a set of modules that are
mapped to primitives and properly orchestrating them. In this study, we further
expand the discussion by incorporating simultaneous activation of the skills
and structuring them into multiple hierarchies in a recursive fashion.
Moreover, we sought to devise an algorithm that can properly orchestrate the
skills with different action spaces via multiplicative Gaussian distributions,
which highly increases the reusability. By exploiting the modularity,
interpretability can also be achieved by observing the modules that are used in
the new task if each of the skills is known. We demonstrate how the proposed
scheme can be employed in practice by solving a pick and place task with a 6
DoF manipulator, and examine the effects of each property from ablation

Communication then requires two agents labour under similar compulsions and
have similar experiences (construct similar solutions to similar tasks). Any
non-human intelligence may construct solutions such that any rationale for
their behaviour (and thus the meaning of their signals) is outside the scope of
what a human is inclined to notice or comprehend. Further, the more compressed
a signal, the closer it will appear to random noise. Another intelligence may
possess the ability to compress information to the extent that, to us, their
signals would appear indistinguishable from noise (an explanation for The Fermi
Paradox). To facilitate predictive accuracy an AGI would tend to more
compressed representations of the world, making any rationale for their
behaviour more difficult to comprehend for the same reason. Communication with

nonequilibrium environmental noise. Recently, studies on engines that harvest
energy from active environments have attracted a great deal of attention

the superiority of the network extends to forecast leads up to 5 days. Second,
combining the network predictions with the weather-model forecasts
significantly improves the accuracy of model forecasts, especially for

bifurcation diagram in the parameter plane of the two feedback strengths
showing how periodic orbits bifurcate from a curve of Hopf bifurcations and
disappear along a curve where both period and amplitude grow beyond bound as
the orbits become saw-tooth shaped. We then `switch on' the delay within the
state-dependent feedback term, reflected by a parameter $b>0$. Our main
conclusion is that the new parameter $b$ has an immediate effect: as soon as
$b>0$ the bifurcation diagram for $b=0$ changes qualitatively and,
specifically, the nature of the limiting saw-tooth shaped periodic orbits
changes. Moreover, we show $-$ numerically and through center manifold analysis
$-$ that a degeneracy at $b=1/3$ of an equilibrium with a double real
eigenvalue zero leads to a further qualitative change and acts as an organizing
center for the bifurcation diagram.
  Our results demonstrate that state dependence in delayed feedback terms may
give rise to new dynamics and, moreover, that the observed dynamics may change
significantly when the state-dependent feedback depends on past states of the

paper presents an efficient solution for the IK problem of 2-segment continuum
robots with one or two inextensible segments (a.k.a, constant segment lengths).
Via representing the robot's shape as piecewise line segments, the
configuration variables are separated from the IK formulation such that solving
a one-variable nonlinear equation leads to the solution of the entire IK
problem. Furthermore, an in-depth investigation of the boundaries of the
dexterous workspace of the end effector caused by the configuration variables

work thus far in continual learning focuses on supervised learning and some
recent works on unsupervised learning. In many domains, each task contains a
mix of labelled (typically very few) and unlabelled (typically plenty) training
examples, which necessitates a semi-supervised learning approach. To address
this in a continual learning setting, we propose a framework for
semi-supervised continual learning called Meta-Consolidation for Continual
Semi-Supervised Learning (MCSSL). Our framework has a hypernetwork that learns
the meta-distribution that generates the weights of a semi-supervised auxiliary
classifier generative adversarial network $(\textit{Semi-ACGAN})$ as the base
network. We consolidate the knowledge of sequential tasks in the hypernetwork,
and the base network learns the semi-supervised learning task. Further, we
present $\textit{Semi-Split CIFAR-10}$, a new benchmark for continual
semi-supervised learning, obtained by modifying the $\textit{Split CIFAR-10}$
dataset, in which the tasks with labelled and unlabelled data arrive
sequentially. Our proposed model yields significant improvements in the
continual semi-supervised learning setting. We compare the performance of
several existing continual learning approaches on the proposed continual

fewest errors should be selected from the n-best list using a language model
(LM). However, LMs are usually trained to maximize the likelihood of correct
word sequences, not to detect ASR errors. We propose an ASR rescoring method
for directly detecting errors with ELECTRA, which is originally a pre-training
method for NLP tasks. ELECTRA is pre-trained to predict whether each word is
replaced by BERT or not, which can simulate ASR error detection on large text
corpora. To make this pre-training closer to ASR error detection, we further
propose an extended version of ELECTRA called phone-attentive ELECTRA
(P-ELECTRA). In the pre-training of P-ELECTRA, each word is replaced by a
phone-to-word conversion model, which leverages phone information to generate
acoustically similar words. Since our rescoring method is optimized for
detecting errors, it can also be used for word-level confidence estimation.
Experimental evaluations on the Librispeech and TED-LIUM2 corpora show that our
rescoring method with ELECTRA is competitive with conventional rescoring
methods with faster inference. ELECTRA also performs better in confidence
estimation than BERT because it can learn to detect inappropriate words not
only in fine-tuning but also in pre-training.

for complex nonlinear computation. We present a renormalized theory of a
prototypical neural field theory, the stochastic Wilson-Cowan equation. We
compute the flow of couplings, which parameterize interactions on increasing

describes the eigenfrequency bifurcation near the EPD. The EPD has the great
potential to enhance the sensitivity of a sensing system by orders of

authentication under the real-life conditions with the codes printed on an

application of a magnetic field along the spin-chain direction, distinct
magnetically ordered phases can be induced. We studied the thermal conductivity
$\kappa$ in this material across the magnetic phase diagram as well as in the
paramagnetic regime in the temperature ranges 0.07-1 K and 9-300 K. We found
that in linarite the heat is carried mainly by phonons but shows a peculiar
non-monotonic behavior in field. In particular, $\kappa$ is highly suppressed
at the magnetic phase boundaries, indicative of strong scattering of the
phonons off critical magnetic fluctuations. Even at temperatures far above the
magnetically ordered phases, the phononic thermal conductivity is reduced due
to scattering off magnetic fluctuations. The mean free path due to spin-phonon
scattering ($l_{\text{spin-phonon}}$) was determined as function of
temperature. A power law behavior was observed mainly above 0.5 K indicating
the thermal activation of spin fluctuations. In the critical regime close to
the saturation field, $l_{\text{spin-phonon}}$ shows a $1/T$ dependence.
Furthermore, a magnon thermal transport channel was verified in the helical
magnetic phase. We estimate a magnon mean free path which corresponds to about

current. One notable feature of the discovered nonreciprocal spin waves is its
gapless nature, which can lead to a large thermal rectification effect at

  Intelligence",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a dominant paradigm for
machine learning with graphs. Research on GNNs has mainly focused on the family
of message passing neural networks (MPNNs). Similar to the Weisfeiler-Leman
(WL) test of isomorphism, these models follow an iterative neighborhood
aggregation procedure to update vertex representations, and they next compute
graph representations by aggregating the representations of the vertices.
Although very successful, MPNNs have been studied intensively in the past few
years. Thus, there is a need for novel architectures which will allow research
in the field to break away from MPNNs. In this paper, we propose a new graph
neural network model, so-called $\pi$-GNN which learns a ""soft"" permutation
(i.e., doubly stochastic) matrix for each graph, and thus projects all graphs
into a common vector space. The learned matrices impose a ""soft"" ordering on
the vertices of the input graphs, and based on this ordering, the adjacency
matrices are mapped into vectors. These vectors can be fed into fully-connected
or convolutional layers to deal with supervised learning tasks. In case of
large graphs, to make the model more efficient in terms of running time and
memory, we further relax the doubly stochastic matrices to row stochastic
matrices. We empirically evaluate the model on graph classification and graph
regression datasets and show that it achieves performance competitive with
state-of-the-art models.

there exist some inherent problems in these methods; such as, local features,

Present work proposes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based novel

among current methods. The generator of the proposed model comprises of FH
network and two sub-networks, assisting FH network to generate high resolution

an auto encoder is proposed to generate high resolution coefficients of
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). To add three dimensional parametric

a shape model of 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) to add structural constraint to the

searches from astrophysical coalescing compact binaries. The compact binary
coalescence (CBC) search pipelines perform the matched filter between the GW
detector's data and a large set of analytical waveforms. However, the
computational cost of performing matched filter is very high as the required
number of the analytical waveforms is also high. Recently, various deep
learning-based methods have been deployed to identify a GW signal in the
detector output as an alternative to computationally expensive matched
filtering techniques. In past work, the researchers have considered the
detection of GW signal mainly as a classification problem, in which they train
the deep learning-based architecture by considering the noise and the GW signal
as two different classes. However, in this work, for the first time, we have
combined the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and matched filter methods to
reduce the computational cost of the search by reducing the number of matched
filtering operations. We have implemented the CNN based architecture not only
for classification of the signal but also to identify the location of the
signal in the intrinsic parameter space. Identifying the location in which the
detected signal lies enables us to perform the matched filter operations
between the data and the analytical waveforms generated for the smaller region
of the parameter space only - thereby reducing the computational cost of the
search. We demonstrate our method for two-dimensional parameter space for
stellar to high mass binary black hole systems. In particular, we are able to
classify between pure noise and noisy BBH signals with 99% accuracy. Further,
the detected signals have been sub-classified into patches in mass components

text vectorization for the task of raster text editing in display media, such

image transformation or generation in the raster domain, we learn a text
vectorization model to parse all the rendering parameters including text,
location, size, font, style, effects, and hidden background, then utilize those
parameters for reconstruction and any editing task. Our text vectorization
takes advantage of differentiable text rendering to accurately reproduce the
input raster text in a resolution-free parametric format. We show in the
experiments that our approach can successfully parse text, styling, and
background information in the unified model, and produces artifact-free text
editing compared to a raster baseline.

properties by evaluating the protein structure. The proteins are recycled to
fabricate triboelectric layers, and the triboelectric series according to
electrical properties is determined for the first time. Using a special
structure design, we construct a plant-protein-enabled biodegradable TENG by
integrating a polylactic acid film, which is used as a new type of mulch film
to construct a growth-promoting system that generates space electric fields for
agriculture. Thus, from the plant protein to the crop, a sustainable recycling
loop is implemented. Using bean seedlings as a model to confirm the feasibility
of the mulch film, we further use it in the cultivation of greenhouse
vegetables. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
plant-protein-enabled biodegradable TENG in sustainable agriculture.

Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and

Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UN GHS) in the
European Union. The goal of this WoE methodology is to facilitate
classification of NMs according to CLP criteria, following the decision trees
defined in ECHA's CLP regulatory guidance. The proposed methodology involves
the following stages: (1) collection of data for different NMs related to the
endpoint of interest: each study related to each NM is referred as a Line of
Evidence (LoE); (2) computation of weighted scores for each LoE: each LoE is
weighted by a score calculated based on agreed data quality and completeness
criteria defined in the GRACIOUS project; (3) comparison and integration of the
weighed LoEs for each NM: A Monte Carlo resampling approach is adopted to
quantitatively and probabilistically integrate the weighted evidence; and (4)
assignment of each NM to a hazard class: according to the results, each NM is
assigned to one of the classes defined by the CLP regulation. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration and the classification of the weighted LoEs, an R
tool was developed. Finally, the approach was tested against an endpoint
relevant to CLP (Aquatic Toxicity) using data retrieved from the eNanoMapper

quality of coronal magnetic field models, which is based upon comparisons with
observational data from multiple sources. Aims: Many of these coronal models
may use a range of initial parameters that produce a large number of physically
reasonable field configurations. However, that does not mean that these results
are reliable and comply with the observations. With an appropriate validation
scheme the quality of a coronal model can be assessed. Methods: The validation
scheme is developed on the example of the EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting
Information Asset (EUHFORIA) coronal model. For observational comparison we use
EUV and white-light data to detect coronal features on the surface (open
magnetic field areas) and off-limb (streamer and loop) structures from multiple
perspectives (Earth view and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory -
STEREO). The validation scheme can be applied to any coronal model that
produces magnetic field line topology. Results: We show its applicability by
using that validation scheme on a large set of model configurations, which can
be efficiently reduced to an ideal set of parameters that matches best with
observational data. Conclusions: We conclude that by using a combined empirical
visual classification with a mathematical scheme of topology metrics a very
efficient and rather objective quality assessment for coronal models can be
performed.

  Models",,,,,"cs.LG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning has been widely used within learning algorithms for robotics.
One disadvantage of deep networks is that these networks are black-box
representations. Therefore, the learned approximations ignore the existing
knowledge of physics or robotics. Especially for learning dynamics models,
these black-box models are not desirable as the underlying principles are well
understood and the standard deep networks can learn dynamics that violate these
principles. To learn dynamics models with deep networks that guarantee
physically plausible dynamics, we introduce physics-inspired deep networks that
combine first principles from physics with deep learning. We incorporate
Lagrangian mechanics within the model learning such that all approximated
models adhere to the laws of physics and conserve energy. Deep Lagrangian
Networks (DeLaN) parametrize the system energy using two networks. The
parameters are obtained by minimizing the squared residual of the
Euler-Lagrange differential equation. Therefore, the resulting model does not
require specific knowledge of the individual system, is interpretable, and can
be used as a forward, inverse, and energy model. Previously these properties
were only obtained when using system identification techniques that require
knowledge of the kinematic structure. We apply DeLaN to learning dynamics
models and apply these models to control simulated and physical rigid body
systems. The results show that the proposed approach obtains dynamics models
that can be applied to physical systems for real-time control. Compared to
standard deep networks, the physics-inspired models learn better models and
capture the underlying structure of the dynamics.

inferred from the 1.3 mm continuum visibility profiles and the radial

Molecular column densities are derived with the line fitting tool XCLASS. The
physical and chemical properties are combined by applying the physical-chemical
model MUSCLE in order to constrain the chemical timescales of a few line-rich
cores. The morphology and spatial correlations of the molecular emission are
analyzed using the HOG method. The mid-infrared data show that both regions
contain a cluster of young stellar objects. Bipolar molecular outflows are
observed in the CO 2-1 transition toward the strong mm cores indicating
protostellar activity. We find strong molecular emission of SO, SiO, H2CO, and
CH3OH in locations which are not associated with the mm cores. These shocked
knots can be either associated with the bipolar outflows or, in the case of
ISOSS J23053+5953, with a colliding flow that creates a large shocked region
between the mm cores. The mean chemical timescale of the cores is lower (20 000
yr) compared to that of the sources of the more evolved CORE sample (60 000
yr). With the HOG method, we find that the spatial emission of species tracing
the extended emission and of shock-tracing molecules are well correlated within
transitions of these groups.

experimentally characterize and analyze the synchronization process of two

setting where the number of data $n$ and their dimension $p$ are both large and
comparable, we show, under a Gaussian mixture model for the data, that the
eigenspectrum of ${\bf K}$ is independent of the distribution of the
i.i.d.(zero-mean and unit-variance) entries of ${\bf w}$, and only depends on
$\sigma(\cdot)$ via its (generalized) Gaussian moments $\mathbb{E}_{z\sim
\mathcal N(0,1)}[\sigma'(z)]$ and $\mathbb{E}_{z\sim \mathcal
N(0,1)}[\sigma''(z)]$. As a result, for any kernel matrix ${\bf K}$ of the form
above, we propose a novel random features technique, called Ternary Random
Feature (TRF), that (i) asymptotically yields the same limiting kernel as the
original ${\bf K}$ in a spectral sense and (ii) can be computed and stored much
more efficiently, by wisely tuning (in a data-dependent manner) the function
$\sigma$ and the random vector ${\bf w}$, both taking values in $\{-1,0,1\}$.
The computation of the proposed random features requires no multiplication, and
a factor of $b$ times less bits for storage compared to classical random
features such as random Fourier features, with $b$ the number of bits to store
full precision values. Besides, it appears in our experiments on real data that
the substantial gains in computation and storage are accompanied with somewhat
improved performances compared to state-of-the-art random features

capacitance C0 at every lattice site. These parameters can be completely
measured by impedance spectroscopy. Given that a tilted Dirac cone can be
described by a background spacetime metric, the impedance spectroscopy can
perfectly provide (local) information about the metric of the spacetime.
Non-uniform spatial dependence of the mutual inductance or capacitance induces
non-trivial geometrical structure on the emergent spacetime.

insights into the formation and evolution histories of celestial bodies. The
five stable isotopes of titanium are used to study the early history of the
solar system and constrain Galactic chemical models. The minor isotopes of
titanium are relatively abundant compared to those of other elements, making
them more accessible for challenging observations. We assessed the feasibility
of performing titanium isotope measurements in exoplanet atmospheres, and in
particular, whether processing techniques used for high-resolution spectroscopy
affect the derived isotope ratios. We used an archival high-dispersion CARMENES
spectrum of the M-dwarf GJ 1002 as a proxy for an exoplanet observed at very
high signal-to-noise. Spectral retrievals using petitRADTRANS models were
performed on both narrow (7045-7090 {\AA}) and wide (7045-7500 {\AA})
wavelength regions, resulting in isotope ratios and uncertainties. These
retrievals were repeated on the spectrum with its continuum removed to mimic
typical high-dispersion exoplanet observations. The relative abundances of all
minor Ti isotopes are found to be slightly enhanced compared to terrestrial
values. Loss of continuum information from broadband spectral filtering has
little effect on the isotope ratios. The CARMENES spectrum was subsequently
degraded by adding varying levels of Gaussian noise to estimate the
signal-to-noise requirements for future exoplanet atmospheric observations. For
the wide wavelength range, a spectrum with signal-to-noise of 5 is required to
determine the isotope ratios with relative errors $\lesssim$10%. Super Jupiters
at large angular separations from their host star are the most accessible
exoplanets, requiring about an hour of observing time on 8-meter-class
telescopes, and less than a minute of observing time with the future Extremely
Large Telescope.

  Principles","10 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2011.10602",,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As Mobile Networks (MNs) are advancing towards meeting mobile users
requirements, the rural-urban divide still remains a major challenge. While
areas within the urban space (metropolitan mobile space) are being developed,
rural areas are left behind. Due to challenges of low population density, low
income, difficult terrain, non-existent infrastructure, lack of power grid,
remote areas have low digital penetration. This situation makes remote areas
less attractive towards investments and to operate connectivity networks, thus
failing to achieve universal access to the Internet. In addressing this issue,
this paper proposes a new BS deployment and resource management method for
remote and rural areas. Here, two MN operators share their resources towards
the procurement and deployment of green energy-powered BSs equipped with
computing capabilities. Then, the network infrastructure is shared between the
mobile operators, with the main goal of enabling energy-efficient
infrastructure sharing, i.e., BS and its co-located computing platform. Using
this resource management strategy in rural communication sites guarantees a
Quality of Service (QoS) comparable to that of urban communication sites. The
performance evaluation conducted through simulations validates our analysis as
the prediction variations observed shows greater accuracy between the harvested
energy and the traffic load. Also, the energy savings decrease as the number of
mobile users (50 users in our case) connected to the remote site increases.
Lastly, the proposed algorithm achieves 51% energy savings when compared with
the 43% obtained by our benchmark algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates
superior performance over the benchmark algorithm as it uses foresighted
optimization where the harvested energy and the expected load are predicted
over a given short-term horizon.

findings are that journalists are generally more active and interact with more

structure is very aligned with reference models derived in anthropology and
observed in general human ego networks. Remarkably, the similarity is even
higher than the one of politicians and generic users ego networks. This may
imply a greater cognitive involvement with Twitter for journalists than for
other user categories. From a dynamic perspective, journalists have stable
short-term relationships that do not change much over time. In the longer term,
though, ego networks can be pretty dynamic, especially in the innermost
circles. Moreover, the ego-alter ties of journalists are often
information-driven, as they are mediated by hashtags both at their inception

recovery of FRI and BL signals in comparison with classical uniform sampling in
the Fourier-domain and Nyquist methods, respectively. In terms of mean square
error (MSE), the reduction reaches at least 5 dB for both classes of signals.
Our numerical evaluations also demonstrate that the MSE further decreases when
the number of pulses comprising the FRI signal increases. A similar observation
is demonstrated for BL signals. In particular, we show that, in contrast to the
classical method, increasing the frequency of the IF-TEM input decreases the
quantization step size, which can reduce the MSE.

refines them into high-quality oriented proposals. After AOPG, we apply a Fast

large-scale datasets is also a hindrance to the development of oriented object

temperature coefficient (TC) and line sensitivity (LS) correction. A 0.18

the fact that the category of analytic contravariant functors is Koszul.
  The second proof proceeds by making the equivalence explicit using the

an attention mechanism enabling the second network to focus on interesting

the operator's workload could help prevent calamitous events from occurring.
This workload estimation could enable an AI to make informed decisions to
assist or advise the operator, in an advanced human-robot interaction
framework. We propose a method, named Fessonia, for real-time cognitive
workload estimation from multiple parameters of an operator's driving behaviour
via the use of behavioural entropy. Fessonia is comprised of: a method to
calculate the entropy (i.e. unpredictability) of the operator driving behaviour
profile; the Driver Profile Update algorithm which adapts the entropy
calculations to the evolving driving profile of individual operators; and a
Warning And Indication System that uses workload estimations to issue advice to
the operator. Fessonia is evaluated in a robot teleoperation scenario that
incorporated cognitively demanding secondary tasks to induce varying degrees of
workload. The results demonstrate the ability of Fessonia to estimate different
levels of imposed workload. Additionally, it is demonstrated that our approach
is able to detect and adapt to the evolving driving profile of the different
operators. Lastly, based on data obtained, a decrease in entropy is observed
when a warning indication is issued, suggesting a more attentive approach
focused on the primary navigation task.

lemma (EEL), which is valid for reversible random walks, to irreversible
walkers. Such a generalised EEL leads to explicit formulae for the MFPTs

A lot of these users often employ sarcasm to convey their intended meaning in a

applications to automatically understand and identify their goal and the harm

dynamical systems. Interestingly, GCMs formed by an ensemble of weakly coupled
identical chaotic units generically exhibit a hyperchaotic 'turbulent' state. A
decade ago, Takeuchi et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 124101 (2011)] theorized
that in turbulent GCMs the largest Lyapunov exponent (LE), $\lambda(N)$,
depends logarithmically on the system size $N$:
$\lambda_\infty-\lambda(N)\simeq c/\ln N$. We revisit the problem and analyze,
by means of analytical and numerical techniques, turbulent GCMs with positive
multipliers to show that there is a remarkable lack of universality, in
conflict with the previous prediction. In fact, we find a power-law scaling
$\lambda_\infty-\lambda(N)\simeq c/N^{\gamma}$, where $\gamma$ is a
parameter-dependent exponent in the range $0<\gamma\le1$. However, for strongly
dissimilar multipliers, the LE varies with $N$ in a slower fashion, which is
here numerically explored. Although our analysis is only valid for GCMs with
positive multipliers, it suggests that a universal convergence law for the LE
cannot be taken for granted in general GCMs.

including control, robotics and economics. Especially for continuous control,
solving this differential equation and its extension the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs
equation, is important as it yields the optimal policy that achieves the
maximum reward on a give task. In the case of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs
equation, which includes an adversary controlling the environment and
minimizing the reward, the obtained policy is also robust to perturbations of
the dynamics. In this paper we propose continuous fitted value iteration (cFVI)
and robust fitted value iteration (rFVI). These algorithms leverage the
non-linear control-affine dynamics and separable state and action reward of
many continuous control problems to derive the optimal policy and optimal
adversary in closed form. This analytic expression simplifies the differential
equations and enables us to solve for the optimal value function using value
iteration for continuous actions and states as well as the adversarial case.
Notably, the resulting algorithms do not require discretization of states or
actions. We apply the resulting algorithms to the Furuta pendulum and cartpole.
We show that both algorithms obtain the optimal policy. The robustness Sim2Real
experiments on the physical systems show that the policies successfully achieve
the task in the real-world. When changing the masses of the pendulum, we
observe that robust value iteration is more robust compared to deep
reinforcement learning algorithm and the non-robust version of the algorithm.

performance and learning behavior. Although normalization methods spurred the
development of increasingly deep and efficient architectures, they also
increase the vulnerability with respect to noise and input corruptions. In most
applications, however, noise is ubiquitous and diverse; this can often lead to
complete failure of machine learning systems as they fail to cope with
mismatches between the input distribution during training- and test-time. The
most common normalization method, batch normalization, reduces the distribution
shift during training but is agnostic to changes in the input distribution
during test time. This makes batch normalization prone to performance
degradation whenever noise is present during test-time. Sample-based
normalization methods can correct linear transformations of the activation
distribution but cannot mitigate changes in the distribution shape; this makes
the network vulnerable to distribution changes that cannot be reflected in the
normalization parameters. We propose an unsupervised non-parametric
distribution correction method that adapts the activation distribution of each
layer. This reduces the mismatch between the training and test-time
distribution by minimizing the 1-D Wasserstein distance. In our experiments, we
empirically show that the proposed method effectively reduces the impact of
intense image corruptions and thus improves the classification performance

motivated by gender stereotypes applied to software engineers, assuming that
men perform better than their women peers. If this same bias is present in pair
programming, it could work against the goal of improving gender balance.
  Objective. In a remote setting in which students cannot directly observe
their peers, we aim to explore whether they behave differently when the
perceived gender of their remote PP partners changes, searching for differences
in (i) the perceived productivity compared to solo programming; (ii) the
partner's perceived technical competency compared to their own; (iii) the
partner's perceived skill level; (iv) the interaction behavior, such as the
frequency of source code additions, deletions, etc.; and (v) the type and
relative frequencies of dialog messages in a chat window.
  Method. Using the twincode platform, several behaviors are automatically
measured during the remote PP process, together with two questionnaires and a
semantic tagging of the pairs' chats. A series of experiments to identify the
effect, if any, of possible gender bias shall be performed. The control group
will have no information about their partner's gender, whereas the treatment
group will receive such information but will be selectively deceived about
their partner's gender. For each response variable we will (i) compare control
and experimental groups for the score distance between two in-pair tasks; then,
using the data from the experimental group only, we will (ii) compare scores
using the partner's perceived gender as a within-subjects variable; and (iii)
analyze the interaction between the partner's perceived gender and the
subject's gender.

classical and important problem in statistics. When the alphabet size is large
compared to number of samples, a portion of the distribution is highly likely
to be unobserved or sparsely observed. The missing mass, defined as the sum of
probabilities $\text{Pr}(x)$ over the missing letters $x$, and the Good-Turing
estimator for missing mass have been important tools in large-alphabet
distribution estimation. In this article, given a positive function $g$ from
$[0,1]$ to the reals, the missing $g$-mass, defined as the sum of
$g(\text{Pr}(x))$ over the missing letters $x$, is introduced and studied. The
missing $g$-mass can be used to investigate the structure of the missing part
of the distribution. Specific applications for special cases such as
order-$\alpha$ missing mass ($g(p)=p^{\alpha}$) and the missing Shannon entropy
($g(p)=-p\log p$) include estimating distance from uniformity of the missing
distribution and its partial estimation. Minimax estimation is studied for
order-$\alpha$ missing mass for integer values of $\alpha$ and exact minimax
convergence rates are obtained. Concentration is studied for a class of
functions $g$ and specific results are derived for order-$\alpha$ missing mass
and missing Shannon entropy. Sub-Gaussian tail bounds with near-optimal
worst-case variance factors are derived. Two new notions of concentration,
named strongly sub-Gamma and filtered sub-Gaussian concentration, are

investigations of asymptotically optimal QKD protocols are proposed. Precisely,
We present an abstraction of prepare-measure QKD protocols and investigate two
special cases which are optimal among all protocols coding by the same states.
Our analyses demonstrate that the asymptotically optimal QBER bounds coding by
orthogonal qubits are about 22.17$\%$ for both general C-NOT attacks and
memoryless attacks while the bounds coding by non-orthogonal states in two
mutually unbiased basis are about 25.30$\%$ for general C-NOT attacks and

the ultimate potential of the security under such attacks.

researches on QKD by employing insecure measurement devices, namely

attacks on measurement devices and thus an untrusted third party can be
employed for measuring. However, a weakness of previous MDI-QKD protocols is
the need of joint measurements such as Bell measurements whose efficiency is
low in practise. On the other hand, can all QKD protocols become

scheme, called $'measurement-device-independenization'$, making prepare-measure
QKD protocols become MDI-QKD protocols, which needs not to employ joint

The protocol might look like the detector-device-independent(DDI) protocols but
it is also secure under the Trojan horse attack. To illustrate this, we
investigate the photon-number-adding(PNA) attack and present a scheme, called
$'photon-number-purification'$, which can also be employed to close loopholes

high-quality three-dimensional visuals. However, fulfilling this potential
remains a practical challenge due to computational complexity and visual

perceptual graphics to accelerate the development of practical holographic
display systems. Firstly, our method infers the user's focal depth and
generates images only at their focus plane without using any moving parts.
Second, the images displayed are metamers; in the user's peripheral vision,
they need only be statistically correct and blend with the fovea seamlessly.
Unlike previous methods, our method prioritises and improves foveal visual
quality without causing perceptually visible distortions at the periphery. To
enable our method, we introduce a novel metameric loss function that robustly
compares the statistics of two given images for a known gaze location. In
parallel, we implement a model representing the relation between holograms and
their image reconstructions. We couple our differentiable loss function and
model to metameric varifocal holograms using a stochastic gradient descent
solver. We evaluate our method with an actual proof-of-concept holographic
display, and we show that our CGH method leads to practical and perceptually
three-dimensional image reconstructions.

of certain random spin chains is valid for this model. For this purpose, we
study the effective central charge characterizing the logarithmic divergence of
the entanglement entropy (EE) and the prefactor of the distribution of
distances between localization centers on the two sublattices, which must
fulfill a consistency relation for a RSS. For $\alpha>1$, we find by exact
diagonalization an overall logarithmic divergence of the entanglement entropy
with an effective central charge varying with $\alpha$. The large $\alpha$
limit of the effective central charge is found to be different from that of the
nearest-neighbor hopping model. The consistency relation of RSS is violated for
$\alpha\le 2$, while for $\alpha>2$ it is possibly valid, but this conclusion
is hampered by a crossover induced by the short-range fixed point. The EE is
also calculated by the strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG) method
numerically. Besides the traditional scheme, we construct and apply a more
efficient minimal SDRG scheme having a linear (nearest-neighbor) structure,
which turns out to be an accurate approximation of the full SDRG scheme for not
too small $\alpha$. The SDRG method is found to provide systematically lower
effective central charges than exact diagonalization does, nevertheless it
becomes more and more accurate for increasing $\alpha$. Furthermore, as opposed
to nearest-neighbor models, it indicates a weak dependence on the disorder
distribution.

compared with 3D systems, in particular, due to the hexatic phase playing a
central role in melting scenarios. The attraction range is known to affect
critical gas-liquid behavior (liquid-liquid in protein and colloidal systems),
but the effect of attraction on melting in 2D systems remains unstudied
systematically. Here, we reveal how the attraction range affects the phase
diagrams and melting scenarios in a 2D system. Using molecular dynamics
simulations we considered the generalized Lennard-Jones system with a fixed
repulsion branch and different power indices of attraction, from long-range
dipolar to short-range sticky-spheres-like. A drop in the attraction range has
been found to reduce the temperature of the gas-liquid critical point, bringing
it closer to the gas-liquid-solid triple point. At high-temperatures,
attraction does not affect the melting scenario that proceeds through the
cascade of solid-hexatic (Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless) and hexatic-liquid
(first-order) phase transitions. In the case of dipolar attraction, we observed
\emph{two triple points}, inherent in a 2D system: hexatic-liquid-gas and
crystal-hexatic-gas, the temperature of the crystal-hexatic-gas triple point is
\emph{below} the hexatic-liquid-gas triple point. This observation may have
far-reaching consequences for future studies, since phase diagrams determine
possible routes of self-assembly in molecular, protein, and colloidal systems,
whereas the attraction range can be adjusted with complex solvents and external
electric or magnetic fields. The results obtained may be widely used in
condensed matter, chemical physics, materials science, and soft matter.

programming language ProbLog. A ProbLog program defines a distribution over
logic programs by specifying for each clause the probability that it belongs to

The semantics of ProbLog is given by the success probability of a query, which
corresponds to the probability that the query succeeds in a randomly sampled
program. It is well-defined when each random sample uniquely determines the
truth values of all logical atoms. Argumentation problems, however, represent
an interesting practical application where this is not always the case.
SMProbLog generalizes the semantics of ProbLog to the setting where multiple
truth assignments are possible for a randomly sampled program, and implements
the corresponding algorithms for both inference and learning tasks. We then
show how this novel framework can be used to reason about probabilistic
argumentation problems. Therefore, the key contribution of this paper are: a
more general semantics for ProbLog programs, its implementation into a
probabilistic programming framework for both inference and parameter learning,

study minmax group fairness in paradigms where different participating entities
may only have access to a subset of the population groups during the training
phase. We formally analyze how this fairness objective differs from existing
federated learning fairness criteria that impose similar performance across
participants instead of demographic groups. We provide an optimization
algorithm -- FedMinMax -- for solving the proposed problem that provably enjoys
the performance guarantees of centralized learning algorithms. We
experimentally compare the proposed approach against other methods in terms of
group fairness in various federated learning setups.

  Transition System for Unified Opinion Role Labeling","AAAI2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unified opinion role labeling (ORL) aims to detect all possible opinion
structures of 'opinion-holder-target' in one shot, given a text. The existing
transition-based unified method, unfortunately, is subject to longer opinion
terms and fails to solve the term overlap issue. Current top performance has
been achieved by employing the span-based graph model, which however still
suffers from both high model complexity and insufficient interaction among
opinions and roles. In this work, we investigate a novel solution by revisiting
the transition architecture, and augmenting it with a pointer network
(PointNet). The framework parses out all opinion structures in linear-time
complexity, meanwhile breaks through the limitation of any length of terms with
PointNet. To achieve the explicit opinion-role interactions, we further propose
a unified dependency-opinion graph (UDOG), co-modeling the syntactic dependency
structure and the partial opinion-role structure. We then devise a
relation-centered graph aggregator (RCGA) to encode the multi-relational UDOG,
where the resulting high-order representations are used to promote the
predictions in the vanilla transition system. Our model achieves new
state-of-the-art results on the MPQA benchmark. Analyses further demonstrate
the superiority of our methods on both efficacy and efficiency.

from specific sets of $m$-variate polynomials. These codes allow for the design
of high-rate codes that can recover every codeword or information symbol from
many disjoint sets. Recently, the underlying approaches have been combined for
the bi-variate case to construct lifted multiplicity codes, a generalization of
lifted codes that can offer further rate improvements. We continue the study of
these codes by first establishing new lower bounds on the rate of lifted
Reed-Solomon codes for any number of variables $m$, which improve upon the
known bounds for any $m\ge 4$. Next, we use these results to provide lower
bounds on the rate and distance of lifted multiplicity codes obtained from
polynomials in an arbitrary number of variables, which improve upon the known
results for any $m\ge 3$.
  Specifically, we investigate a subcode of a lifted multiplicity code formed
by the linear span of $m$-variate monomials whose restriction to an arbitrary
line in $\mathbb{F}_q^m$ is equivalent to a low-degree univariate polynomial.
We find the tight asymptotic behavior of the fraction of such monomials when
the number of variables $m$ is fixed and the alphabet size $q=2^\ell$ is large.
Using these results, we give a new explicit construction of batch codes
utilizing lifted Reed-Solomon codes. For some parameter regimes, these codes
have a better trade-off between parameters than previously known batch codes.
Further, we show that lifted multiplicity codes have a better trade-off between
redundancy and the number of disjoint recovering sets for every codeword or
information symbol than previously known constructions, thereby providing the
best known PIR codes for some parameter regimes. Additionally, we present a new
local self-correction algorithm for lifted multiplicity codes.

and superconductivity (SC), while $\text{Ca}_{3}\text{Rh}_{4}\text{Sn}_{13}$
does not develop CDW order. As expected, the CDW transition temperature,
$T_{\text{CDW}}$, is universally suppressed by irradiation in all three
compositions. The superconducting transition temperature, $T_{c}$, behaves in a
more complex manner. In $\text{Sr}_{3}\text{Rh}_{4}\text{Sn}_{13}$, it
increases initially in a way consistent with a direct competition of CDW and
SC, but quickly saturates at higher irradiation doses. In the other three

suppression is found in $\text{Ca}_{3}\text{Rh}_{4}\text{Sn}_{13}$, which does
not have CDW order. We further examine this composition by measuring the London
penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, from which we derive the superfluid density.
The result unambiguously points to a weak-coupling, full single gap, isotropic
superconducting state. Therefore, we must explain two seemingly incompatible
experimental observations: a single isotropic superconducting gap and a
significant suppression of $T_{c}$ by non-magnetic disorder. We conduct a
quantitative theoretical analysis based on a generalized Anderson theorem which

unsupervised representation learning which embeds augmented versions of the
anchor close to each other (positive samples) and pushes the embeddings of
other samples (negatives) apart. As revealed in recent studies, CL can benefit
from hard negatives (negatives that are most similar to the anchor). However,
we observe limited benefits when we adopt existing hard negative mining
techniques of other domains in Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL). We perform
both experimental and theoretical analysis on this phenomenon and find it can
be attributed to the message passing of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Unlike CL
in other domains, most hard negatives are potentially false negatives
(negatives that share the same class with the anchor) if they are selected
merely according to the similarities between anchor and themselves, which will
undesirably push away the samples of the same class. To remedy this deficiency,
we propose an effective method, dubbed \textbf{ProGCL}, to estimate the
probability of a negative being true one, which constitutes a more suitable
measure for negatives' hardness together with similarity. Additionally, we
devise two schemes (i.e., \textbf{ProGCL-weight} and \textbf{ProGCL-mix}) to
boost the performance of GCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProGCL
brings notable and consistent improvements over base GCL methods and yields
multiple state-of-the-art results on several unsupervised benchmarks or even
exceeds the performance of supervised ones. Also, ProGCL is readily pluggable
into various negatives-based GCL methods for performance improvement. We

spectrum is in good agreement with the results presented in previous studies,
which used different methodologies to extract the spectrum, achieving similar
precision. We explored several atmospheric models and inferred from spectral
retrieval that a model containing H2O and NH3 is the preferred scenario. The
CHOCOLATE methodology is particularly interesting for future studies of
exoplanets around young and active stars or moderate to fast rotating stars,
considering SOAP's ability to model stellar active regions and the fact that
the rotational broadening of spectral lines favors its application.
Furthermore, CHOCOLATE will allow the broad transmission spectrum of a planet
to be retrieved using high signal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution spectroscopy
with the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), where
low-resolution spectroscopy will not always be accessible.

distances between pairs of embeddings of sentences labelled as semantically

approaches that require not-paired input sentences. We instead propose a
language-independent approach to build large datasets of pairs of informal

intrinsic powerful signals of relatedness: replies and quotes of tweets. We use
the collected pairs to train a Transformer model with triplet-like structures,
and we test the generated embeddings on Twitter NLP similarity tasks (PIT and
TURL) and STSb. We also introduce four new sentence ranking evaluation
benchmarks of informal texts, carefully extracted from the initial collections
of tweets, proving not only that our best model learns classical Semantic
Textual Similarity, but also excels on tasks where pairs of sentences are not
exact paraphrases. Ablation studies reveal how increasing the corpus size
influences positively the results, even at 2M samples, suggesting that bigger
collections of Tweets still do not contain redundant information about semantic
similarities.

cooperation and defection. However, the possibility to not participate is also
frequently available. This type of problem can be studied through the optional
public goods game. The introduction of the ""Loner"" strategy, allows players to
withdraw from the game, which leads to a cooperator-defector-loner cycle. While
prosocial punishment can help increase cooperation, anti-social punishment --
where defectors punish cooperators -- causes its downfall in both experimental
and theoretical studies.
  In this paper, we introduce social norms that allow agents to condition their
behaviour to the reputation of their peers. We benchmark this both with respect
to the standard optional public goods game and to the variant where all types
of punishment are allowed. We find that a social norm imposing a more moderate
reputational penalty for opting out than for defecting, increases cooperation.
When, besides reputation, punishment is also possible, the two mechanisms work
synergically under all social norms that do not assign to loners a strictly
worse reputation than to defectors. Under this latter setup, the high levels of
cooperation are sustained by conditional strategies, which largely reduce the
use of pro-social punishment and almost completely eliminate anti-social
punishment.

reveals that both separation and attachment states can be stably established

initial condition and evolutionary history, a thought experiment involving two
processes with the same three steps but in different orders is designed,
possibly constructing the two distinct-different stable CCR flows.
Subsequently, three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are then performed
to replicate the thought experiment, verifying the existence of the bistable
states in CCR flows. In the end, the method of virtual separation disturbance
is proposed to detect whether potential bistable states exist, theoretically
demonstrating the bistability of CCR flows. As a canonical type of Shock
waveBoundary layer interactions, local CCR flows often appear on aircraft,
hence the bistability will certainly bring noteworthy changes to the global
aerothermodynamic characteristics, which supersonic/hypersonic flight has to
deal with.

implementation, our experimental results indicate that DroQ is doubly (sample

computational efficiency with that of SAC.

studied due to its promising features, such as a high endurance and fast
switching times. The information is stored in a high resistive state (logcial
'0', HRS) and a low resistive state (logcial '1', LRS). It can also be operated
in two different writing schemes, namely a unipolar switching mode (LRS and HRS
are written at the same voltage polarity) and a bipolar switching mode (LRS and
HRS are written at opposite voltage polarities). VCM, however, still suffers
from a large variability during writing operations and also faults occur, which
are not yet fully understood and, therefore, require a better understanding of
the underlying fault mechanisms. In this study, a new intrinsic failure
mechanism is identified, which prohibits RESET times (transition from LRS to
HRS) faster than 400 ps and possibly also limits the endurance. We demonstrate
this RESET speed limitation by measuring the RESET kinetics of two valence
change memory devices (namely Pt/TaO$_\mathrm{x}$/Ta and
Pt/ZrO$_\mathrm{x}$/Ta) in the time regime from 50 ns to 50 ps, corresponding
to the fastest writing time reported for VCM. Faster RESET times were achieved
by increasing the applied pulse voltage. Above a voltage threshold it was,
however, no longer possible to reset both types of devices. Instead a unipolar
SET (transition from HRS to LRS) event occurred, preventing faster RESET times.
The occurrence of the unipolar SET is attributed to an oxygen exchange at the
interface to the Pt~electrode, which can be suppressed by introducing an oxygen
blocking layer at this interface, which also allowed for 50 ps fast RESET
times.

implement and easy to train. Unlike standard ARMs, they do not require causal
masking of model representations, and can be trained using an efficient
objective similar to modern probabilistic diffusion models that scales
favourably to highly-dimensional data. At test time, ARDMs support parallel
generation which can be adapted to fit any given generation budget. We find
that ARDMs require significantly fewer steps than discrete diffusion models to
attain the same performance. Finally, we apply ARDMs to lossless compression,
and show that they are uniquely suited to this task. Contrary to existing
approaches based on bits-back coding, ARDMs obtain compelling results not only
on complete datasets, but also on compressing single data points. Moreover,
this can be done using a modest number of network calls for (de)compression due
to the model's adaptable parallel generation.

foreground stellar sub-structure, which is identified as a distance bimodality
(12 kpc apart) in the previous studies using Red Clump (RC) stars.
Interestingly, studies of Red giant branch (RGB) stars in the eastern SMC
indicate a bimodal radial velocity (RV) distribution. In this study, we
investigate the connection between these two bimodal distributions to better
understand the nature and origin of the foreground stellar sub-structure in the
eastern SMC. We use the Gaia EDR3 astrometric data and archival RV data of RGB
stars for this study. We found a bimodal RV distribution of RGB stars
(separated by 35 - 45 km/s) in the eastern and south-western (SW) outer
regions. The observed proper motion values of the lower and higher RV RGB
components in the eastern regions are similar to those of the foreground and
main-body RC stars respectively. This suggests that the two RGB populations in
the eastern region are separated by a similar distance as those of the RC
stars, and the RGB stars in the lower RV component are part of the foreground
sub-structure. Based on the differences in the distance and RV of the two
components, we estimated an approximate time of formation of this sub-structure
as 307+/-65 Myr ago. This is comparable with the values predicted by
simulations for the recent epoch of tidal interaction between the Magellanic
Clouds. Comparison of the observed properties of RGB stars, in the outer SW
region, with N-body simulations shows that the higher RV component in the SW
region is at a farther distance than the main body, indicating the presence of
a stellar Counter-Bridge in the SW region of the SMC.

flexible and scalable replication of multi-staged cyber-attacks in an SG

an image to predict future states. For the visual scoring, we experiment with
different similarity measures to calculate distance based on entity
appearances, including a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder,
pre-trained using Siamese networks. In initial evaluation experiments, we show
that our method, combining scoring structure of the kinematic and visual models
within a MHT framework, has improved performance especially in edge cases where
entity motion is unpredictable, or the data presents frames with significant

present a method of preparing a fiducial quantum state with a confidence beyond
the thermal limit. It is based on real time monitoring of the qubit through a
negative-result measurement -- the equivalent of a `Maxwell's demon' that
triggers the experiment only upon the appearance of a qubit in the
lowest-energy state. We experimentally apply it to initialize an electron spin
qubit in silicon, achieving a ground-state initialization fidelity of 98.9(4)%,
corresponding to a 20$\times$ reduction in initialization error compared to the
unmonitored system. A fidelity approaching 99.9% could be achieved with
realistic improvements in the bandwidth of the amplifier chain or by slowing
down the rate of electron tunneling from the reservoir. We use a nuclear spin
ancilla, measured in quantum nondemolition mode, to prove the value of the
electron initialization fidelity far beyond the intrinsic fidelity of the
electron readout. However, the method itself does not require an ancilla for
its execution, saving the need for additional resources. The quantitative
analysis of the initialization fidelity reveals that a simple picture of
spin-dependent electron tunneling does not correctly describe the data. Our
digital `Maxwell's demon' can be applied to a wide range of quantum systems,

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have developed rapidly and been applied

simpler data structure and can provide rich hierarchical information for text
classification. Inspired by the structural entropy, we construct the coding
tree of the graph by minimizing the structural entropy and propose HINT, which
aims to make full use of the hierarchical information contained in the text for
the task of text classification. Specifically, we first establish a dependency
parsing graph for each text. Then we designed a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to decode the key information in the graph and convert each graph to
its corresponding coding tree. Based on the hierarchical structure of the
coding tree, the representation of the entire graph is obtained by updating the
representation of non-leaf nodes in the coding tree layer by layer. Finally, we
present the effectiveness of hierarchical information in text classification.

popular benchmarks while having a simple structure and few parameters.

nephrosclerosis (HN) is a common syndrome of hypertension, characterized by
chronic kidney microvascular damage. Early diagnosis of microvascular damage
using conventional ultrasound imaging encounters challenges in sensitivity and
specificity owing to the inherent diffraction limit. Ultrasound localization
microscopy (ULM) has been developed to obtain microvasculature and
microvascular hemodynamics within the kidney, and would be a promising tool for
early diagnosis of CKD.
  Methods: In this study, the advantage of ULM over conventional clinical
inspection (serum and urine tests) and ultrasound imaging (Doppler and
contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging) for early diagnosis of HN was
investigated. Examinations were carried out on 6 spontaneously hypertensive
rats (SHR) and 5 normal Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at the age of 10 weeks.
  Results: The experimental results showed that the indicators derived from
conventional clinical inspection and ultrasound imaging (PSV, EDV, RI, RT,
IMAX, mTT and AUC) did not show significant difference between hypertensive and
healthy rats (p > 0.05), while the TTP derived from CEUS (p < 0.05) and the
mean blood flow speed in artery of SHR derived from ULM is significantly higher
than that of WKY rats (p < 0.01).
  Conclusion: The quantitative results showed that ULM has higher sensitivity
than conventional clinical inspection and ultrasound imaging. ULM may promise a
reliable solution for early diagnosis of HN.

  Methods. The wide field of view and the large collecting area in the 0.2-2.3

spectroscopy of G18.95-1.1.
  Results. The X-ray ridge of G18.95-1.1 is asymmetric, indicating either
supernova ejecta asymmetry or their interaction with a cloud. The X-ray dim
northern regions outside the pulsar wind nebula can be described by a thin
thermal plasma emission with a temperature ~0.3 keV and a solar composition.
The X-ray spectra of a few bright clumps located along the southern ridge may
be satisfactorily approximated by a single thermal component of the Si-rich
ejecta at the collisional ionization equilibrium with a temperature of about
0.3 keV. The bright ridge can be alternatively fit with a single component that
is not dominated by equilibrium ejecta with T ~ 0.6 keV. The high ratio of the
derived Si/O abundances indicates that the ejecta originated in deep layers of
the progenitor star. The plasma composition of a southern Si-rich clump and the
bright ridge are similar to what was earlier found in the Vela shrapnel A and

generated by a fast forward and slow backward motion of a fluid which does not
progress on average. In both sections, soft particles deform differently and
thus progress relatively to the liquid. We demonstrate this by using
Lattice-Boltzmann simulations of ubiquitous red blood cells in microchannels,
as well as simulations for capsules and minimal soft tissue models in unbounded
Poiseuille flows. The propulsion of the soft particles depends besides the
oscillation asymmetry on their size, deformation type and elasticity. This is
also demonstrated by analytical calculations for a minimal model. Our findings
may stimulate a rethinking of particle sorting methods. For example, healthy
and malignant cells often differ in their elasticity. With the proposed method,
several cell types with different deformability can be separated simultaneously
without labeling or obstacles in a microfluidic device.

backpropagation to optimize the network weights and achieve, after a number of

spatialization of the acoustc scene. Two scenarios with different

  school value-added effects on the mean and variance of student achievement",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  School value-added models are widely applied to study the effects of schools
on student achievement and to monitor and hold schools to account for their
performances. The traditional model is a multilevel linear regression of
student current achievement on student prior achievement, background
characteristics, and a school random intercept effect. The predicted random
effect aims to measure the mean academic progress students make in each school.
In this article, we argue that much is to be gained by additionally studying
the variance in student progress in each school. We therefore extend the
traditional model to allow the residual variance to vary as a log-linear
function of the student covariates and a new school random effect to predict
the influence of schools on the variance in student progress. We illustrate
this new model with an application to schools in London. Our results show the
variance in student progress varies substantially across schools - even after
adjusting for differences in the variance in student progress associated with
different student groups - and that this variation is predicted by school
characteristics. We discuss the implications of our work for research and
school accountability.

the far Carina Arm, at distances mainly in excess of 4 kpc from the Sun, within
the sky region, $282^{\circ} < \ell < 294^{\circ}$ and $-3^{\circ} < b <
+1^{\circ}$ (Galactic coordinates). The sample is constructed by extending an
existing blue-selected catalogue, and cross-matching with Gaia EDR3 astrometry.
The observed pattern of proper motions is modulated into a saw-tooth pattern,
with full amplitude approaching 1 mas yr$^{-1}$, recurring roughly every 2--3
degrees of longitude (200--300 pc at the median OB-star distance of 5.8 kpc).
Kinematic perturbation of underlying circular rotation is most likely present.
The data also reveal a moving group containing $>50$ OB stars at $\ell \sim
286^{\circ}$, $b \sim -1^{\circ}.4$ behind the main run of the far arm. An
analysis of relative proper motions is performed that yields an incidence of
runaway O stars of at least 10\% (potentially $>20$\% when full space motions
become available). To map where runaways have run away from, we set up
simulations for the region that assume linear trajectories and test for
trajectory impact parameter in order to identify likely ejection hot spots. We
find the method currently gives good results for times of flight of up to
$\sim$4 Myr. It shows convincingly that only NGC 3603 and Westerlund 2 have
ejected OB stars in significant numbers. Indeed, both clusters have experienced
intense spells of ejection between 0.6--0.9 and 0.5--0.8 Myr ago, respectively.

light has a dominant influence on the interference effects at a balanced beam
splitter, irrespective of the state initially occupying the other input mode.
Specifically, the parity of the nonclassical state gives rise to destructive
interference effects that result in deep valleys in the output joint number
distribution of which the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is a limiting case. The
counter-intuitive influence of even a single photon to control the output of a
beam splitter illuminated by any field, be it a coherent or even a noisy
thermal field, demonstrates the extraordinary power of non-classicality. The
canonical example of total destructive interference of quantum amplitudes
leading to the absence of coincidence counts from a 50/50 beam splitter is the
celebrated HOM effect, characterized by the vanishing of the joint probability
of detecting singe photons in each of the output beams. We show that this is a
limiting case of more general input states upon which a 50/50 BS can create
total, or near total, destructive interference of quantum amplitudes. For odd
photon number input Fock states of arbitrary value n>0 we show that the joint
photon number probabilities vanish when detecting identical photon numbers in
each output beams. We examine the mixing of photon number states of n = 1, 2,
and 3 with a CV state, such as a coherent state of arbitrary amplitude, and a
thermal state. These vanishing joint probabilities form what we call a central
nodal line -- a contiguous set of zeros representing complete destructive
interference of quantum amplitudes. For odd or even photon number Fock states
with n>1 there will be additional off-diagonal pseudo-nodal curves along which
the joint photon number probabilities are either zero, or near zero, which
constitute a near, but not complete, destructive interference.

clusters has been greatly extended in terms of both observation and theory over
the last decade. ZwCl 2341+0000 is a double-relic merging galaxy cluster;
previous studies have shown that half of the S relic is associated with an
X-ray surface brightness discontinuity, while the other half not. The
discontinuity was believed to be a shock front. Therefore, it is a mysterious
case of an only partial shock-relic connection. By using the 206.5 ks deep
Chandra observations, we aim to investigate the nature of the S discontinuity.
Meanwhile, we aim to explore new morphological and thermodynamical features. In
addition, we utilize the GMRT and JVLA images to compute radio spectral index
(SI) maps. In the deep observations, the previously reported S surface
brightness discontinuity is better described as a sharp change in slope or as a
kink, which is likely contributed by the disrupted core of the S subcluster.
The radio SI maps show spectral flattening at the SE edge of the S relic,
suggesting that the location of the shock front is 640 kpc away from the kink.
We update the radio shock Mach number to be $2.2\pm0.1$ and $2.4\pm0.4$ for the
S and N radio relics, respectively, based on the injection SI. We also put a 3
sigma lower limit on the X-ray Mach number of the S shock to be >1.6.
Meanwhile, the deep observations reveal that the N subcluster is in a perfect
cone shape, with a ~400 kpc linear cold front on each side. This type of conic
subcluster has been predicted by simulations but is observed here for the first
time. It represents a transition stage between a blunt-body cold front and a
slingshot cold front. Strikingly, we found a 400 kpc long gas trail attached to
the apex of the cone, which could be due to the gas stripping. In addition, an
over-pressured hot region is found in the SW flank of the cluster.

Vmax, host halo mass and distance to host halo centre. We also dissect the

host halo centre, as already described in Molin\'e et al. (2017).
Interestingly, we also find subhaloes of the same mass to be significantly more
concentrated into more massive hosts. Finally, we investigate the redshift
evolution of cV, and provide accurate fits that take into account all mentioned
dependencies. Our results offer an unprecedented detailed characterization of
the subhalo population, consistent over a wide range of subhalo and host halo
masses, as well as cosmic times. Our work enables precision work in any future
research involving dark matter halo substructure.

feasible measurements, namely Gaussian and photo-detection-like measurements.
For Gaussian measurements, we develop a general method to identify the optimal
measurement numerically, and derive the analytical solutions in some relevant
cases. For a class of single-mode states that includes thermal ones, the
optimal Gaussian measurement is either Heterodyne or Homodyne, depending on the
temperature regime. This is in contrast to the general setting, in which a
projective measurement in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is optimal
regardless of temperature. In the general multi-mode case, and unlike the
general unrestricted scenario where joint measurements are not helpful for
thermometry (nor for any parameter estimation task), it is open whether joint
Gaussian measurements provide an advantage over local ones. We conjecture that
they are not useful for thermal systems, supported by partial analytical and
numerical evidence. We further show that Gaussian measurements become optimal
in the limit of large temperatures, while on/off photo-detection-like
measurements do it for when the temperature tends to zero. Our results
therefore pave the way for effective thermometry of Gaussian quantum systems
using experimentally realizable measurements.

The former relation continues to hold in the same limit at large times, whereas
the latter does not. Our results indicate that in the thermodynamic limit, the
Nielsen complexity and the Loschmidt echo show enhanced temporal oscillations

this behaviour by studying the nature of quasi-particle excitations in the

hadrons are mesons and diquark baryons. We study two models which describe a
transition of matter from the Bose-Einstein-Condensation regime at low density
to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime at high density. The first model is
based on coherent states of diquarks, and the second is the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model with diquark pairing terms. We particularly focus on how quark states are
occupied as baryon density increases. We find that, due to the occupied quark
levels, the ideal gas picture of diquarks breaks down at density significantly
less than the density where baryon cores overlap. The saturation of quark
states at low momenta stiffens equations of state. We also study the effects of
interactions which depend on the quark occupation probability. We argue that
equations of state become very stiff when the bulk part of the quark Fermi sea
has the effective repulsion but the Fermi surface enjoys the attractive
correlations. This disparity for different momentum domains is possible due to
the strong channel dependence in gluon exchanges with momentum transfer of
$0.2-1$ GeV. These concepts can be transferred from QC$_2$D to QCD in any
numbers of colors.

strongly-coupled chiral gauge theories is still quite unsatisfactory today.
Conventional wisdom about strongly-coupled gauge theories, successfully applied
to QCD, is not always as useful in chiral gauge theories. Recently some new
ideas and techniques have been developed, which involve concepts of generalized
symmetries, of gauging a discrete center symmetry, and of generalizing the 't
Hooft anomaly matching constraints to include certain mixed symmetries. This
new development has been applied to chiral gauge theories, leading to many
interesting, sometimes quite unexpected, results. For instance, in the context
of generalized Bars-Yankielowicz and generalized Georgi-Glashow models, these
new types of anomalies give a rather clear indication in favor of the dynamical
Higgs phase, against confining, flavor symmetric vacua.
  Another closely related topics is strong anomaly and the effective low-energy
action representing it. It turns out that they have significant implications on
the phase of chiral gauge theories, giving indications consistent with the
findings based on the generalized anomalies.
  Some striking analogies and contrasts between the massless QCD and chiral
gauge theories seem to emerge from these discussions. The aim of this work is
to review these developments.

offers high accuracy with errors in the order of a percent. In cases where the
interactions are predominantly short-range, e.g. for out-of-plane illumination
of planar metasurfaces, it can be used to describe aperiodic metasurfaces of
basically unlimited size, containing many thousands of unordered plasmonic
nanostructures. We furthermore show that the model is capable to spectrally
resolve coupling effects. The approach is therefore of highest interest for the
field of metasurfaces. It provides significant advantages in applications like
homogenization of large aperiodic planar metastructures or the design of

investigate the local stability of the limiting McKean-Vlasov system through
the construction of a local Lyapunov function. We first compute the limit of
adequately scaled relative entropy functions associated with the explicit
stationary distribution of the N-particles system. Using a Laplace principle
for empirical vectors we show that the limit takes an explicit form. Then we
demonstrate that this limit satisfies a descent property which, combined with
some mild assumptions shows that it is indeed a local Lyapunov function.

  Segmentation","Accepted in WACV 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In medical image segmentation, supervised deep networks' success comes at the
cost of requiring abundant labeled data. While asking domain experts to
annotate only one or a few of the cohort's images is feasible, annotating all
available images is impractical. This issue is further exacerbated when
pre-trained deep networks are exposed to a new image dataset from an unfamiliar
distribution. Using available open-source data for ad-hoc transfer learning or
hand-tuned techniques for data augmentation only provides suboptimal solutions.
Motivated by atlas-based segmentation, we propose a novel volumetric
self-supervised learning for data augmentation capable of synthesizing
volumetric image-segmentation pairs via learning transformations from a single
labeled atlas to the unlabeled data. Our work's central tenet benefits from a
combined view of one-shot generative learning and the proposed self-supervised
training strategy that cluster unlabeled volumetric images with similar styles
together. Unlike previous methods, our method does not require input volumes at
inference time to synthesize new images. Instead, it can generate diversified
volumetric image-segmentation pairs from a prior distribution given a single or
multi-site dataset. Augmented data generated by our method used to train the
segmentation network provide significant improvements over state-of-the-art
deep one-shot learning methods on the task of brain MRI segmentation. Ablation

recognition. We start by identifying the main challenges related to action
recognition from videos and review how they have been addressed by current
methods.
  Based on these challenges, and by focusing on the temporal aspect of actions,
we argue that current fixed-sized spatio-temporal kernels in 3D convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) can be improved to better deal with temporal variations
in the input. Our contributions are based on the enlargement of the
convolutional receptive fields through the introduction of spatio-temporal
size-varying segments of videos, as well as the discovery of the local feature
relevance over the entire video sequence. The resulting extracted features
encapsulate information that includes the importance of local features across
multiple temporal durations, as well as the entire video sequence.
  Subsequently, we study how we can better handle variations between classes of
actions, by enhancing their feature differences over different layers of the
architecture. The hierarchical extraction of features models variations of
relatively similar classes the same as very dissimilar classes. Therefore,
distinctions between similar classes are less likely to be modelled. The
proposed approach regularises feature maps by amplifying features that
correspond to the class of the video that is processed. We move away from
class-agnostic networks and make early predictions based on feature
amplification mechanism.
  The proposed approaches are evaluated on several benchmark action recognition
datasets and show competitive results. In terms of performance, we compete with
the state-of-the-art while being more efficient in terms of GFLOPs.
  Finally, we present a human-understandable approach aimed at providing visual
explanations for features learned over spatio-temporal networks.

verifying properties of stochastic systems including randomized protocols and
reinforcement learning models. Existing methods rely on the assumed structure
and probabilities of certain system transitions. These assumptions may be
incorrect, and may even be violated by an adversary who gains control of system
components.
  In this paper, we develop a formal framework for adversarial robustness in
systems modeled as discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs). We base our framework
on existing methods for verifying probabilistic temporal logic properties and
extend it to include deterministic, memoryless policies acting in Markov
decision processes (MDPs). Our framework includes a flexible approach for
specifying structure-preserving and non structure-preserving adversarial
models. We outline a class of threat models under which adversaries can perturb
system transitions, constrained by an $\varepsilon$ ball around the original
transition probabilities.
  We define three main DTMC adversarial robustness problems: adversarial
robustness verification, maximal $\delta$ synthesis, and worst case attack
synthesis. We present two optimization-based solutions to these three problems,
leveraging traditional and parametric probabilistic model checking techniques.
We then evaluate our solutions on two stochastic protocols and a collection of
Grid World case studies, which model an agent acting in an environment
described as an MDP. We find that the parametric solution results in fast
computation for small parameter spaces. In the case of less restrictive
(stronger) adversaries, the number of parameters increases, and directly
computing property satisfaction probabilities is more scalable. We demonstrate
the usefulness of our definitions and solutions by comparing system outcomes
over various properties, threat models, and case studies.

contention decision attempts to maximize not its own downlink throughput, but
rather a network-wide objective. We formulate this problem as a decentralized
partially observable Markov decision process with a novel reward structure that
provides long term proportional fairness in terms of throughput. We then
introduce a two-stage Markov decision process in each time slot that uses

decision. Finally, we incorporate these features into a distributed
reinforcement learning framework for contention-based spectrum access. Our

integrate them into the RNN-T architecture. We demonstrate for the first time,

advantages, such as a reduced computational cost and a lower latency, which are

dynamic play. On the empirical side, we study the effectiveness of a number of
popular chess Gambits. This is a natural setting as chess Gambits require a
sequential assessment of a set of moves (a.k.a. policy) after the Gambit has
been accepted. Our analysis uses Stockfish 14.1 to calculate the optimal
Bellman $Q$ values, which fundamentally measures if a position is winning or
losing. To test whether Bellman's equation holds in play, we estimate the
transition probabilities to the next board state via a database of expert human
play. This then allows us to test whether the \emph{Gambiteer} is following the
optimal path in his decision-making. Our methodology is applied to the popular

lane-keeping assistance and lane departure warning systems. However, under
certain challenging circumstances, it is difficult to get satisfactory
performance in accurately detecting the lanes from one single image as mostly
done in current literature. Since lane markings are continuous lines, the lanes
that are difficult to be accurately detected in the current single image can
potentially be better deduced if information from previous frames is
incorporated. This study proposes a novel hybrid spatial-temporal (ST)
sequence-to-one deep learning architecture. This architecture makes full use of
the ST information in multiple continuous image frames to detect the lane
markings in the very last frame. Specifically, the hybrid model integrates the
following aspects: (a) the single image feature extraction module equipped with
the spatial convolutional neural network; (b) the ST feature integration module
constructed by ST recurrent neural network; (c) the encoder-decoder structure,
which makes this image segmentation problem work in an end-to-end supervised
learning format. Extensive experiments reveal that the proposed model
architecture can effectively handle challenging driving scenes and outperforms
available state-of-the-art methods.

the noncommutativity tensor $\theta^{\mu\nu}(x)$. The latter guarantees the
Lorentz invariance of the theory. The usual form of this map and its other
recent generalizations do not consider such a covariant star product. We
construct the Seiberg-Witten map for the gauge parameter, the gauge field and
the strength tensor to the first order in the noncommutativity parameter
$\theta^{\mu\nu}(x)$. Prescription for the generalization of the map to higher
orders is also given. Interestingly, the associativity of the covariant star
product both in the first and second orders requires the same constraints,
namely, on the $\theta^{\mu\nu}(x)$ and on the space-time connection. This fact
suggests that the same constraints could be enough to ensure the associativity
in all orders. The resulting Seiberg-Witten map applies both to the internal
and space-time gauge theories. Comparisons with the Seiberg-Witten map based on
other (non-covariant) star products are given and some characteristic
properties are also presented. As an application, we consider the $GL(2, C)$
noncommutative gauge theory of gravitation, in which it is shown that the
connection determines a space-time with symplectic structure (as proposed by
Zumino et al [AIP Conf. Proc. 1200 (2010), 204, arXiv:0910.0459]). This example
shows that the constraints required for the associativity of the
gauge-covariant star product can be satisfied. The presented $GL(2, C)$
noncommutative gauge theory of gravitation is also compared to the one (given
by Chamseddine [Phys. Rev. D 69 (2004), 024015, hep-th/0309166]) with

recently, the literature to date has focused on games with independent strategy
sets; little is known about solving games with dependent strategy sets, which
can be characterized as min-max Stackelberg games. We introduce two first-order
methods that solve a large class of convex-concave min-max Stackelberg games,
and show that our methods converge in polynomial time. Min-max Stackelberg
games were first studied by Wald, under the posthumous name of Wald's maximin
model, a variant of which is the main paradigm used in robust optimization,
which means that our methods can likewise solve many convex robust optimization
problems. We observe that the computation of competitive equilibria in Fisher
markets also comprises a min-max Stackelberg game. Further, we demonstrate the
efficacy and efficiency of our algorithms in practice by computing competitive
equilibria in Fisher markets with varying utility structures. Our experiments
suggest potential ways to extend our theoretical results, by demonstrating how
different smoothness properties can affect the convergence rate of our
algorithms.

choices associated with economic development depend, at least in part, on
economic preferences such as willingness to take risk and patience. This paper
studies whether temperature could be one of the potential channels that
influences such economic preferences. Using data from the Indonesia Family Life
Survey and NASAs Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and
Applications data we exploit quasi exogenous variations in outdoor temperatures
caused by the random allocation of survey dates. This approach allows us to
estimate the effects of temperature on elicited measures of risk aversion,
rational choice violations, and impatience. We then explore three possible
mechanisms behind this relationship, cognition, sleep, and mood. Our findings
show that higher temperatures lead to significantly increased rational choice
violations and impatience, but do not significantly increase risk aversion.
These effects are mainly driven by night time temperatures on the day prior to
the survey and less so by temperatures on the day of the survey. This impact is
quasi linear and increasing when midnight outdoor temperatures are above 22C.
The evidence shows that night time temperatures significantly deplete cognitive
functioning, mathematical skills in particular. Based on these findings we
posit that heat induced night time disturbances cause stress on critical parts
of the brain, which then manifest in significantly lower cognitive functions
that are critical for individuals to perform economically rational decision
making.

according to two convenient approximations, in the near and far fields (also
known as the Fresnel and Fraunhofer regimes, respectively). Within this
scenario, geometrical optics, the optics describing the light phenomena
observable in our everyday life, is introduced as the short-wavelength limit of
near-field phenomena, assuming that the typical size of the aperture (or
obstacle) that light is incident on is much larger than the light wavelength.
With the purpose to provide an alternative view on how geometrical optics fits
within the context of the diffraction theory, particularly how it emerges, the
transition from the near to the far field is revisited here both analytically
and numerically. Accordingly, first this transition is investigated in the case
of Gaussian beam diffraction, since its full analyticity paves the way for a
better understanding of the paradigmatic (and typical) case of diffraction by
sharp-edged single slits. This latter case is then tackled both analytically,
by means of some insightful approximations and guesses, and numerically. As it
is shown, this analysis makes explicit the influence of the various parameters
involved in diffraction processes, such as the typical size of the input
(diffracted) wave or its wavelength, or the distance between the input and
output planes. Moreover, analytical expressions have been determined for the
critical turnover value of the slit width that separates typical Fraunhofer
diffraction regimes from the behaviors eventually leading to the geometrical
optics limit, finding a good agreement with both numerically simulated results
and experimental data extracted from the literature.

ever-present problems may also have simply become more evident as more CPUs are

  If the RTL (""source code"") of a CPU were available, we could apply greybox
fuzzing to the CPU model almost as we do to any other software
[arXiv:2102.02308]. However our targets are general purpose x86_64 CPUs
produced by third parties, where we do not have the RTL design, so in our case
CPU implementations are opaque. Moreover, we are more interested in electrical

fuzzing software proxies, like CPU simulators or disassemblers, and then
executing the accumulated test inputs (known as the corpus) on actual CPUs on a
large scale. The major difference between this work and traditional software
fuzzing is that a software bug fixed once will be fixed for all installations
of the software, while for CPU defects we have to test every individual core
repeatedly over its lifetime due to wear and tear. In this paper we also
analyze four groups of CPU defects that SiliFuzz has uncovered and describe

branch nodes, whose link to their respective rail lines allows to build the
underlying consistent graph of the network. Every rail line has a ""valid to""
date (or approx) so that time evolution can be displayed. The present progress
of that reconstruction sums up to roughly 90% of what is expected (exact total
unknown). This allows to consider temporal demographic analysis (how many
cities and towns served by the railway since 1925 up on today), and
environmental simulations as well (CO2 cost by given destination ).
