  micro-mechanics and homogenization","PhD Thesis",,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, a computational framework for microstructural modelling of
transverse behaviour of heterogeneous materials is presented. The context of
this research is part of the broad and active field of Computational
Micromechanics, which has emerged as an effective tool both to understand the
influence of complex microstructures on the macro-mechanical response of
engineering materials and to tailor-design innovative materials for specific
applications through a proper modification of their microstructure. The
computational framework presented in this thesis is based on the Virtual
Element Method (VEM), a recently developed numerical technique able to provide
robust numerical results even with highly-distorted meshes. The peculiar
features of VEM have been exploited to analyse two-dimensional representations
of heterogeneous materials microstructures. Ad-hoc polygonal multi-domain
meshing strategies have been developed and tested to exploit the discretisation
freedom that VEM allows. To further simplify the preprocessing stage of the
analysis and reduce the total computational cost, a novel hybrid formulation
for analysing multi-domain problems has been developed by combining the Virtual
Element Method with the well-known Boundary Element Method (BEM). The hybrid
approach has been used to study both composite material transverse behaviour in
presence of inclusions with complex geometries and damage and crack propagation
in the matrix phase. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the
potential of the developed framework.

employed in wireless communications and networks for analyzing and optimizing
RISs, and elaborate on their advantages and limitations. Then, we concentrate
on models for RISs that are based on inhomogeneous sheets of surface impedance,
and offer a step-by-step tutorial on formulating electromagnetically-consistent
analytical models for optimizing the surface impedance. The differences between
local and global designs are discussed and analytically formulated in terms of
surface power efficiency and reradiated power flux through the Poynting vector.
Finally, with the aid of numerical results, we discuss how approximate global
designs can be realized by using locally passive RISs with zero electrical
resistance (i.e., inhomogeneous reactance boundaries with no local power
amplification), even for large angles of reflection and at high power
efficiency.

supermassive binary black hole (BBH) systems. One way for further confirmations
may be searching for other characteristic signatures, such as those in their
broad emission lines (BELs), if any, which require a thorough understanding on
the response of BELs to the BBH systems. In Ji et al. (2021), we have
investigated the response of circumbinary broad line region (BLR) to the
central active secondary black hole under the relativistic Doppler boosting
(BBH-DB) and intrinsic variation (BBH-IntDB) dominant mechanisms for continuum
variation by assuming the middle plane of the BLR aligned with the BBH orbital
plane. In this paper, we explore how the BEL profiles vary when the BLR is
misaligned from the BBH orbital plane with different offset angles under both
the BBH-DB and BBH-IntDB scenarios. Given a fixed inclination angle of the BBH
orbital plane viewed in edge-on and similar continuum light curves produced by
the two scenarios, increasing offset angles make the initial opening angle of
the circumbinary BLR enlarged due to orbital precession caused by the BBH
system, especially for clouds in the inner region, which result in Lorentz-like
BEL profiles for the BBH-DB model but still Gaussian-like profiles for the
BBH-IntDB model at the vertical BLR case. The amplitude of profile variations
decrease with increasing offset angles for the BBH-DB scenario, while keep
nearly constant for the BBH-IntDB scenario, since the Doppler boosting effect
is motion direction preferred but the intrinsic variation is radiated
isotropically. If the circumbinary BLR is composed of a coplanar and a vertical
components with their number of clouds following the mass ratio of the BBHs,
then the bi-BLR features are more significant for the BBH-IntDB model that
require larger mass ratio to generate similar continuum variation than the
BBH-DB model.

Thus, the execution of online data-analytics on edge machines may not be

overcome this, multiple instances of the back-end should be deployed on edge

The thermal field is represented by 2-D thermal contours and 3-D surface plots
to provide an accurate prediction compared to the 1-D analysis using the
time-lag theory. An influence of Fourier number on the heat flow in the
absorber plate is studied for different thermal relaxation times. The present
analysis highlights that the magnitude of plate temperature depends
significantly on the physical geometry. Differences in two models of heat
propagation, viz. classical and thermal wave, in the absorber plate have an
alteration in predicted collector performances. The present study also develops
another design situation for heat transfer in the absorber plate when the
collector shutdowns to the ambient state from its steady condition. Laplace
Transform Method (LTM) in combination with the product solution method uses to
determine the temperature with the initial condition represented as a steady
case. Due to the lagging nature of thermal behavior, a significant difference
between the classical and thermal wave models for the propagation of heat was
observed, and also this study determines the exact time to be taken to reach

science and that the development of scientific knowledge is instead based on
the same principles as biological evolution. Today, machine learning is also
taught as being rooted in induction from big data. Solomonoff induction
implemented in an idealized Bayesian agent (Hutter's AIXI) is widely discussed
and touted as a framework for understanding AI algorithms, even though
real-world attempts to implement something like AIXI immediately encounter
fatal problems. In this paper, we contrast frameworks based on induction with
Donald T. Campbell's universal Darwinism. We show that most AI algorithms in
use today can be understood as using an evolutionary trial and error process
searching over a solution space. In this work we argue that a universal
Darwinian framework provides a better foundation for understanding AI systems.
Moreover, at a more meta level the process of development of all AI algorithms
can be understood under the framework of universal Darwinism.

settings is a challenging problem, as the robot's planning objectives may be at
odds with the human's own intent and expectations. Recent approaches ensure
safe robot operation in uncertain environments through a supervisory control
scheme, sometimes called ""shielding"", which overrides the robot's nominal plan
with a safety fallback strategy when a safety-critical event is imminent. These
reactive ""last-resort"" strategies (typically in the form of aggressive
emergency maneuvers) focus on preserving safety without efficiency
considerations; when the nominal planner is unaware of possible safety
overrides, shielding can be activated more frequently than necessary, leading
to degraded performance. In this work, we propose a new shielding-based
planning approach that allows the robot to plan efficiently by explicitly
accounting for possible future shielding events. Leveraging recent work on
Bayesian human motion prediction, the resulting robot policy proactively
balances nominal performance with the risk of high-cost emergency maneuvers
triggered by low-probability human behaviors. We formalize Shielding-Aware
Robust Planning (SHARP) as a stochastic optimal control problem and propose a
computationally efficient framework for finding tractable approximate solutions
at runtime. Our method outperforms the shielding-agnostic motion planning
baseline (equipped with the same human intent inference scheme) on simulated

performance requirements while maximizing resource utilization to achieve
cost-efficiency, cloud administrators leverage schedulers to orchestrate tasks
to different physical nodes and allow applications from different users to
share the same physical node. On the other hand, micro-architectural attacks
can exploit the shared resources to compromise the confidentiality/integrity of
a co-located victim application. Since co-location is an essential requirement
for micro-architectural attacks, in this work, we investigate whether attackers
can exploit the cloud schedulers to satisfy the co-location requirement. Our
analysis shows that for cloud schedulers that allow users to submit application
requirements, an attacker can carefully select the attacker's application
requirements to influence the scheduler to co-locate it with a targeted victim
application. We call such attack Replication Attack (Repttack). Our
experimental results, in both a simulated cluster environment and a real
cluster, show similar trends; a single attack instance can reach up to 50%
co-location rate and with only 5 instances the co-location rate can reach up to
80%. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a mitigation strategy that can help
defend against Repttack. We believe that our results highlight the fact that
schedulers in multi-user clusters need to be more carefully designed with
security in mind, and the process of making scheduling decisions should involve
as little user-defined information as possible.

dimensional numerical modelling of the resistive MHD equations in global

vertical ($z$) direction, MRI produces radially extended toroidal (azimuthal)
current sheets. In both 2D and 3D when axisymmetric modes dominate, these
current sheets attract each other and merge in the poloidal ($rz$) plane,
driving magnetic reconnection when the Lundquist number $S > 3 \times 10^2$,
making it a possible source of plasmoids (closed magnetic loops) in accretion
disks. At high Lundquist numbers in the 2D regime, starting at $S = 5 \times
10^3$, self-consistent MRI-generated current sheets become thin and subject to
plasmoid instability, and therefore spontaneous magnetic reconnection. When
non-axisymmetric 3D modes dominate, turbulence makes the azimuthal current
sheets further unstable, and stretch vertically. Toroidally extended vertical
current sheets in the inner region, as well as larger 3D magnetic islands in
the outer regions of the disks are also formed. These findings have strong
ramifications for astrophysical disks as potential sources of plasmoids that
could cause local heating, particle acceleration, and high energy EM radiation.

They are linear combinations of any, e.g. global, nested basis functions

the nesting, by evaluating sums sequentially. When the number of functions in

agnostic to the applied local debiasing thus allowing for flexible use of
different local debiasing methods across clients. We evaluate FairFed
empirically versus common baselines for fair ML and federated learning, and
demonstrate that it provides fairer models particularly under highly

will concentrate in gaseous rings more compactly due to stronger aerodynamic
drag. However, the effects of dust concentration on the ring's thermal
structure have not been explored. Using MCRT simulations, we self-consistently
construct ring models by iterating the ring's thermal structure, hydrostatic
equilibrium, and dust concentration. We set up rings with two dust populations
having different settling and radial concentration due to their different
sizes. We find two mechanisms that can lead to temperature dips around the
ring. When the disk is optically thick, the temperature drops outside the ring,
which is the shadowing effect found in previous works adopting a single-dust
population in the disk. When the disk is optically thin, a second mechanism due
to excess cooling of big grains is found. Big grains cool more efficiently,
which leads to a moderate temperature dip within the ring where big dust
resides. This dip is close to the center of the ring. Such temperature dip
within the ring can lead to particle pile-up outside the ring and feedback to
the dust distribution and thermal structure. We couple the MCRT calculations
with a 1D dust evolution model and show that the ring evolves to a different
shape and may even separate to several rings. Overall, dust concentration
within rings has moderate effects on the disk's thermal structure, and
self-consistent model is crucial not only for protoplanetary disk observations
but also for planetesimal and planet formation studies.

experiments use a time-varying transmitter current. Understanding the EM
response requires that we consider both galvanic, or DC currents, as well as

a MUSE data cube centred at FSR 1776. The cluster parameters are derived from
isochrone fitting to the RV-cleaned colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from
visible and near-infrared photometry. The predicted RV distribution for the FSR
1776 coordinates, considering only contributions from the bulge and disc field
stars, is not enough to explain the observed MUSE RV distribution. The extra
population (12\% of the sample) is FSR 1776 with an average RV of $-103.7\pm
0.4~{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. The CMDs reveal that it is 10$\pm$1~Gyr old and
metal-rich, with [Fe/H]$_{phot}\approx + 0.2\pm$0.2,
[Fe/H]$_{spec}=~+0.02\pm0.01~(\sigma~=~0.14$~dex), located at the bulge
distance of 7.24$\pm$0.5~kpc with A$_{\rm V}$ $\approx$ 1.1~mag. The mean
cluster proper motions are
($\langle\mu_{\alpha}\rangle,\langle\mu_{\delta}\rangle$) $=$
($-2.3\pm1.1,-2.6\pm0.8$) ${\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$.} FSR 1776 is an old GC located
in the Galactic bulge with a super-solar metallicity, among the highest for a
Galactic GC. This is consistent with predictions for the age-metallicity
relation of the bulge, being FSR 1776 the probable missing link between typical
GCs and the metal-rich bulge field. High-resolution spectroscopy of a larger
field of view and deeper CMDs are now required for a full characterisation.

the flexibility of its modeling power. However, a general theory for this class
of methods in the frequentist setting is still lacking. In this paper, we
present a theoretical analysis of Thompson Sampling, with a focus on
frequentist regret bounds. In this setting, we show that the standard Thompson
Sampling is not aggressive enough in exploring new actions, leading to
suboptimality in some pessimistic situations. A simple modification called
Feel-Good Thompson Sampling, which favors high reward models more aggressively
than the standard Thompson Sampling, is proposed to remedy this problem. We
show that the theoretical framework can be used to derive Bayesian regret
bounds for standard Thompson Sampling, and frequentist regret bounds for
Feel-Good Thompson Sampling. It is shown that in both cases, we can reduce the
bandit regret problem to online least squares regression estimation. For the
frequentist analysis, the online least squares regression bound can be directly
obtained using online aggregation techniques which have been well studied. The
resulting bandit regret bound matches the minimax lower bound in the finite
action case. Moreover, the analysis can be generalized to handle a class of
linearly embeddable contextual bandit problems (which generalizes the popular
linear contextual bandit model). The obtained result again matches the minimax
lower bound. Finally we illustrate that the analysis can be extended to handle
some MDP problems.

information of galaxy clustering, we forecast $f_{\rm NL}$ measurements using
the decomposition in the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) basis, which can be
naturally cross-correlated with 2D CMB lensing in spherical harmonics. In the
meantime, such a decomposition would also enable us to constrain the growth
rate of structure, a probe of gravity, through the redshift-space distortion
(RSD). As a comparison, we also consider the tomographic spherical harmonic
(TSH) analysis of galaxy samples with different bin sizes. Assuming galaxy
samples that mimic a few future surveys, we perform Fisher forecasts using
linear modes for $f_{\rm NL}$ and the growth rate exponent $\gamma$,
marginalized over standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM)
cosmological parameters and two nuisance parameters that account for clustering
bias and magnification bias. Compared to TSH analysis using only one bin, SFB
analysis could improve $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})$ by factors 3 to 12 thanks to large
radial modes. With future wide-field and high-redshift photometric surveys like
the LSST, the constraint $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}) < 1$ could be achieved using
linear angular multipoles up to $\ell_{\rm min}\simeq 20$. Compared to using
galaxy auto-power spectra only, joint analyses with CMB lensing could improve
$\sigma(\gamma)$ by factors 2 to 5 by reducing degeneracies with other
parameters, especially the clustering bias. For future spectroscopic surveys

dynamical regimes of a finite temperature bosonic superfluid in an elongated
Josephson junction generated by a thin Gaussian barrier over the entire
temperature range where a well-formed condensate can be clearly identified.
Although the dissipation arising from the coupling of the superfluid to the
dynamical thermal cloud increases with increasing temperature as expected, the
importance of this mechanism is found to depend on two physical parameters
associated (i) with the initial chemical potential difference, compared to some
characteristic value, and (ii) the ratio of the thermal energy to the barrier
amplitude. The former determines whether the superfluid Josephson dynamics are
dominated by gradually damped plasma-like oscillations (for relatively small
initial population imbalances), or whether dissipation at early times is
instead dominated by vortex- and sound-induced dissipation (for larger initial
imbalances). The latter defines the effect of the thermal cloud on the
condensate dynamics, with a reversal of roles, i.e. the condensate being driven
by the oscillating thermal cloud, being observed when the thermal particles
acquire enough energy to overcome the barrier. Our findings are within current
experimental reach in ultracold superfluid junctions.

  Circuit","25 pages; submitted to ITCS'22",,,,"cs.IT math.IT q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In neuroscience, researchers have developed informal notions of what it means
to reverse engineer a system, e.g., being able to model or simulate a system in
some sense. A recent influential paper of Jonas and Kording, that examines a
microprocessor using techniques from neuroscience, suggests that common
techniques to understand neural systems are inadequate. Part of the difficulty,
as a previous work of Lazebnik noted, lies in lack of formal language. We
provide a theoretical framework for defining reverse engineering of
computational systems, motivated by the neuroscience context. Of specific
interest are recent works where, increasingly, interventions are being made to
alter the function of the neural circuitry to both understand the system and
treat disorders. Starting from Lazebnik's viewpoint that understanding a system
means you can ``fix it'', and motivated by use-cases in neuroscience, we
propose the following requirement on reverse engineering: once an agent claims
to have reverse-engineered a neural circuit, they subsequently need to be able
to: (a) provide a minimal set of interventions to change the input/output (I/O)
behavior of the circuit to a desired behavior; (b) arrive at this minimal set
of interventions while operating under bounded rationality constraints (e.g.,
limited memory) to rule out brute-force approaches. Under certain assumptions,
we show that this reverse engineering goal falls within the class of
undecidable problems. Next, we examine some canonical computational systems and
reverse engineering goals (as specified by desired I/O behaviors) where reverse
engineering can indeed be performed. Finally, using an exemplar network, the
``reward network'' in the brain, we summarize the state of current
neuroscientific understanding, and discuss how computer-science and
information-theoretic concepts can inform goals of future neuroscience studies.

enables quadrupedal robots to traverse challenging terrains with discrete
footholds using visual feedback. Navigating discrete terrain is challenging for
quadrupeds because the motion of the robot can be aperiodic, highly dynamic,
and blind for the hind legs of the robot. Additionally, the robot needs to
reason over both the feasible footholds as well as robot velocity by speeding
up and slowing down at different parts of the terrain. We build an offline
library of periodic gaits which span two trotting steps on the robot, and
switch between different motion primitives to achieve aperiodic motions of
different step lengths on an A1 robot. The motion library is used to provide
targets to a geometric model predictive controller which controls stance. To
incorporate visual feedback, we use terrain mapping tools to build a local
height map of the terrain around the robot using RGB and depth cameras, and
extract feasible foothold locations around both the front and hind legs of the
robot. Our experiments show a Unitree A1 robot navigating multiple unknown,
challenging and discrete terrains in the real world.

sensitive to effects such as post-Born lensing and nonlinear ISW contributions.
By comparing to conventional methods in quantifying those general relativistic

convergence signal. We also find the accuracy of this method in quantifying the
ISW effects in the highly nonlinear regime outperforms conventional methods by
an order of magnitude. This scheme opens a new path for exploring and modeling

a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent is not always feasible due to economic and
safety concerns. The goal of Offline Reinforcement Learning is to address this
problem by learning effective policies using previously collected datasets.
Standard off-policy RL algorithms are prone to overestimations of the values of
out-of-distribution (less explored) actions and are hence unsuitable for
Offline RL. Behavior regularization, which constraints the learned policy
within the support set of the dataset, has been proposed to tackle the
limitations of standard off-policy algorithms. In this paper, we improve the
behavior regularized offline reinforcement learning and propose BRAC+. First,
we propose quantification of the out-of-distribution actions and conduct
comparisons between using Kullback-Leibler divergence versus using Maximum Mean
Discrepancy as the regularization protocol. We propose an analytical upper
bound on the KL divergence as the behavior regularizer to reduce variance
associated with sample based estimations. Second, we mathematically show that
the learned Q values can diverge even using behavior regularized policy update
under mild assumptions. This leads to large overestimations of the Q values and
performance deterioration of the learned policy. To mitigate this issue, we add
a gradient penalty term to the policy evaluation objective. By doing so, the Q
values are guaranteed to converge. On challenging offline RL benchmarks, BRAC+
outperforms the baseline behavior regularized approaches by 40%~87% and the
state-of-the-art approach by 6%.

works as a self-supervised approach. So DZL could theoretically utilize
infinitely huge amounts of coronary angiographies to learn and improve
performance without laborious data labeling. There is no data preprocessing

learning (RL) for tasks such as Go, Chess, video games, and robot control.
Nevertheless, other combinatorial domains, such as AI planning, still pose
considerable challenges for RL approaches. The key difficulty in those domains
is that a positive reward signal becomes {\em exponentially rare} as the
minimal solution length increases. So, an RL approach loses its training
signal. There has been promising recent progress by using a curriculum-driven
learning approach that is designed to solve a single hard instance. We present
a novel {\em automated} curriculum approach that dynamically selects from a
pool of unlabeled training instances of varying task complexity guided by our
{\em difficulty quantum momentum} strategy. We show how the smoothness of the
task hardness impacts the final learning results. In particular, as the size of
the instance pool increases, the ``hardness gap'' decreases, which facilitates
a smoother automated curriculum based learning process. Our automated
curriculum approach dramatically improves upon the previous approaches. We show
our results on Sokoban, which is a traditional PSPACE-complete planning problem
and presents a great challenge even for specialized solvers. Our RL agent can
solve hard instances that are far out of reach for any previous
state-of-the-art Sokoban solver. In particular, our approach can uncover plans
that require hundreds of steps, while the best previous search methods would
take many years of computing time to solve such instances. In addition, we show
that we can further boost the RL performance with an intricate coupling of our
automated curriculum approach with a curiosity-driven search strategy and a

framework to dynamically grow the model only when necessary. Different from all
previous structure-based methods, GROWN starts from a small seed network,
instead of a full-sized one. We validate GROWN on multiple datasets against
state-of-the-art methods, which shows superior performance in both accuracy and
model size. For example, we achieve 1.0\% accuracy gain on average compared to
the current SOTA results on CIFAR-100 Superclass 20 tasks setting.

  Gao","Design and Evaluate Recomposited OR-AND-XOR-PUF",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a hardware security primitive with a
desirable feature of low-cost. Based on the space of challenge-response pairs
(CRPs), it has two categories:weak PUF and strong PUF. Though designing a
reliable and secure lightweight strong PUF is challenging, there is continuing
efforts to fulfill this gap due to wide range of applications enabled by strong
PUF. It was prospected that the combination of MAX and MIN bit-wise operation
is promising for improving the modeling resilience when MAX and MIN are
employed in the PUF recomposition. The main rationale lies on the fact that
each bit-wise might be mainly vulnerable to one specific type of modeling
attack, combining them can have an improved holistic resilience. This work is
to first evaluate the main PUF performance, in particular,uniformity and
reliability of the OR-AND-XOR-PUF(OAX-PUF)-(x, y, z)-OAX-PUF. Compared with the
most used l-XOR-PUF, the (x, y, z)-OAX-PUF eventually exhibits better
reliability given l=x+y+z without degrading the uniformity retaining to be 50%.
We further examine the modeling resilience of the (x, y, z)-OAX-PUF with four
powerful attacking strategies to date, which are Logistic Regression (LR)
attack, reliability assisted CMA-ES attack, multilayer perceptron (MLP) attack,
and the most recent hybrid LR-reliability attack. In comparison with the
XOR-APUF, the OAX-APUF successfully defeats the CAM-ES attack. However, it
shows no notable modeling accuracy drop against other three attacks, though the
attacking times have been greatly prolonged to LR and hybrid LR-reliability
attacks. Overall, the OAX recomposition could be an alternative lightweight
recomposition method compared to XOR towards constructing strong PUFs if the
underlying PUF, e.g., FF-APUF, has exhibited improved resilience to modeling
attack, because the OAX incurs smaller reliability degradation compared to XOR.

the requirement of the path planning/navigation algorithm should not be content
with the ability to reach the target without any collisions, but also should
try to achieve possible optimal or suboptimal path from the initial position to
the target according to the robot's constrains in practice. This report
investigates path planning and control strategies for mobile robots with
machine learning techniques, including ground mobile robots and flying UAVs.
  In this report, the hybrid reactive collision-free navigation problem under
an unknown static environment is investigated firstly. By combining both the
reactive navigation and Q-learning method, we intend to keep the good
characteristics of reactive navigation algorithm and Q-learning and overcome
the shortcomings of only relying on one of them. The proposed method is then
extended into 3D environments. The performance of the mentioned strategies are
verified by extensive computer simulations, and good results are obtained.
Furthermore, the more challenging dynamic environment situation is taken into
our consideration. We tackled this problem by developing a new path planning
method that utilizes the integrated environment representation and
reinforcement learning. Our novel approach enables to find the optimal path to
the target efficiently and avoid collisions in a cluttered environment with
steady and moving obstacles. The performance of these methods is compared with
other different aspects.

features with principles inspired from the counterfactual framework of causal
inference. Then, we propose a regularization approach to penalize causal and

model robustness and fairness on three datasets with multiple metrics.
Empirical results show that the new models built with causal awareness

formed via the gas accretion onto the solid cores each with a mass of roughly
ten Earth masses. However, rapid radial migration due to disk-planet
interaction prevents the formation of such massive cores via planetesimal
accretion. Comparably rapid core growth via pebble accretion requires very
massive protoplanetary disks because most pebbles fall into the central star.
Although planetesimal formation, planetary migration, and gas-giant core
formation have been studied with much effort, the full evolution path from dust
to planets are still uncertain. Here we report the result of full simulations
for collisional evolution from dust to planets in a whole disk. Dust growth
with realistic porosity allows the formation of icy planetesimals in the inner
disk (> 10 au), while pebbles formed in the outer disk drift to the inner disk
and there grow to planetesimals. The growth of those pebbles to planetesimals
suppresses their radial drift and supplies small planetesimals sustainably in
the vicinity of cores. This enables rapid formation of sufficiently massive
planetary cores within 0.2-0.4 million years, prior to the planetary migration.
Our models shows first gas giants form at 2-7 au in rather common
protoplanetary disks, in agreement with the exoplanet and solar systems.

temporo-spatial interaction within the fMRI signal. The experiments showed that
the proposed model obtains a very high accuracy (97.4%) and outperforms
previous researches on the 7 different task benchmarks from the Human

illustrated the hierarchical emergence of task-specific masks with depth.
Finally, the model was retrained to regress individual traits within the HCP

Transfer learning also achieves good performance. A further visualization
analysis shows that, after transfer learning, low-level attention masks
remained similar to the source domain, whereas high-level attention masks
changed adaptively. In conclusion, the proposed 4D model with attention module
performed well and facilitated interpretation of DNNs, which is helpful for

saturates. On the flip side, if the class conditional variances (and so amount
of overlap between the classes) are large, the gen-error increases with the
number of iterations. To mitigate this undesirable effect, we show that
regularization can reduce the gen-error. The theoretical results are
corroborated by extensive experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets in which

candles and ultra-compact structure in radio quasars acting as standard rulers.
Particularly, two machine learning reconstruction methods (Gaussian Process
(GP) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) are applied to reconstruct the Hubble
diagrams from observational data. We show that both approaches are capable of
reconstructing the current constraints on possible deviations from the CDDR in
the redshift range $z\sim 2.3$. Considering four different parametric methods
of CDDR, which quantify deviations from the CDDR and the standard cosmological
model, we compare the results of the two different machine learning approaches.
It is observed that the validity of CDDR is in well agreement with the current
observational data within $1\sigma$ based on the reconstructed distances
through GP in the overlapping redshift domain. Moreover, we find that
ultra-compact radio quasars could provide $10^{-3}$-level constraints on the
violation parameter at high redshifts, when combined with the observations of
HII galaxies. In the framework of ANN, one could derive robust constraints on
the violation parameter at a precision of $10^{-2}$, with the validity of such
distance duality relation within $2\sigma$ confidence level.

main causes for this is their loss of ability to retain information. The high
amount of medicine intake required by the advanced age is another limiting
factor. Thence, the design of an interactive aid system, preferably using
natural language, to help the older population with medication is in demand. A
chatbot based on a subtractive cluster algorithm, included in unsupervised
learned models, is the chosen solution since the processing of natural
languages is a necessary step in view to construct a chatbot able to answer
questions that older people may pose upon themselves concerning a particular
drug. In this work, the subtractive mountain clustering algorithm has been
adapted to the problem of natural languages processing. This algorithm version
allows for the association of a set of words into clusters. After finding the
centre of every cluster -- the most relevant word, all the others are
aggregated according to a defined metric adapted to the language processing
realm. All the relevant stored information is processed, as well as the
questions, by the algorithm. The correct processing of the text enables the
chatbot to produce answers that relate to the posed queries. To validate the
method, we use the package insert of a drug as the available information and

analysis to determine the isoscalar transition strengths in $^{13}$C. We found
a bump structure around $E_x = 12.5$ MeV due to the isoscalar monopole ($IS0$)
transition. A peak-fit analysis suggested that this bump consisted of several
$1/2^-$ states. We propose that this bump is due to the mirror state of the
13.5 MeV-state in $^{13}$N, which dominantly decays to the $\alpha$ condensed
state in $^{12}$C. It was speculated that the $1/2^-$ states around $E_x =
12.5$ MeV were candidates for the $\alpha$ condensed state, but the $3\alpha +
n$ orthogonality condition model suggests that the $\alpha$ condensed state is
unlikely to emerge as the negative parity states. We also found two $1/2^+$ or
$3/2^+$ states at $E_x = 14.5$ and 16.1 MeV excited with the isoscalar dipole
($IS1$) strengths. We suggest that the 16.1-MeV state is a possible candidate
for the $\alpha$ condensed state predicted by the cluster-model calculations on
the basis of the good correspondence between the experimental and calculated
level structures. However, the theoretical $IS1$ transition strength for this
state is significantly smaller than the measured value. Further experimental

super-Earths. They are inside a range of critical masses overlapping the core
masses (2-20 $M_{\bigoplus}$), which would trigger the runaway accretion and
develop the gas giants. Thus, super-Earths/sub-Neptunes can be formed by
restraining runaway growth of gaseous envelopes. We assess the effect of
planetary rotation in delaying the mass growth. The centrifugal force, induced
by spin, will offset a part of the gravitational force and deform the planet.
Tracking the change in structure, we find that the temperature at the
radiative-convective boundary (RCB) is approximate to the boundary temperature.
Since rotation reduces the radiation energy densities in the convective and
radiative layers, RCB will penetrate deeper. The cooling luminosity would
decrease. Under this condition, the evolutionary timescale can exceed the disk
lifetime (10 Myr), and a super-Earth/sub-Neptune could be formed after
undergoing additional mass loss processes. In the dusty atmosphere, even a
lower angular velocity can also promote a super-Earth/sub-Neptune forming.
Therefore, we conclude that rotation can slow down the planet's cooling and
then promote a super-Earth/sub-Neptune forming.

was evaluated by a testing set with 1200 images using CDR error and $F_1$ score

be a continuous sequence of $N$ items, called an $N$-gram, in which each item
is a word, letter, etc. In this paper, we attempt to estimate LRs based on
$N$-gram frequency information. A naive estimation approach that uses only
$N$-gram frequencies is sensitive to low-frequency (rare) $N$-grams and not
applicable to zero-frequency (unobserved) $N$-grams; these are known as the
low- and zero-frequency problems, respectively. To address these problems, we
propose a method for decomposing $N$-grams into item units and then applying
their frequencies along with the original $N$-gram frequencies. Our method can
obtain the estimates of unobserved $N$-grams by using the unit frequencies.
Although using only unit frequencies ignores dependencies between items, our
method takes advantage of the fact that certain items often co-occur in
practice and therefore maintains their dependencies by using the relevant
$N$-gram frequencies. We also introduce a regularization to achieve robust
estimation for rare $N$-grams. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
method is effective at solving both problems and can effectively control

because most previous studies have assumed that an oracle is a human with
domain knowledge. In this study, we propose a method to replace a part of the
oracle's work in stream-based AL by self-training with weak labeling using a
robot arm. A camera attached to a robot arm takes a series of image data
related to a streamed object, which should have the same label. We use this
information as a weak label to connect a pseudo-label (estimated class label)
and a target instance. Our method selects two data from a series of image data;
high confidence data for correcting pseudo-labels and low confidence data for
improving the performance of the classifier. We paired a pseudo-label provided
to high confidence data with a target instance (low confidence data). By using
this technique, we mitigate the inefficiency in self-training, that is,
difficulty in creating pseudo-labeled training data with a high impact on the
target classifier. In the experiments, we employed the proposed method in the
classification task of objects on a belt conveyor. We evaluated the performance
against human cost on multiple scenarios considering the temporal variation of

segmentation information from previous time points is often not used to aid the
segmentation of a patient's follow-up scans. Also, fully automatic segmentation
techniques frequently produce results that would need further editing for
clinical use. In this work, we propose a new single network model for
interactive segmentation that fully utilizes all available past information to
refine the segmentation of follow-up scans. In the first segmentation round,
our model takes 3D volumes of medical images from two-time points (target and
reference) as concatenated slices with the additional reference time point
segmentation as a guide to segment the target scan. In subsequent segmentation
refinement rounds, user feedback in the form of scribbles that correct the
segmentation and the target's previous segmentation results are additionally
fed into the model. This ensures that the segmentation information from
previous refinement rounds is retained. Experimental results on our in-house

automatic tagging of transcripts into predefined categories, which
traditionally is solved using supervised approach. To overcome the lack of
tagged data, all our proposed approaches use unsupervised methods to solve the
outlined problems. We evaluate the results by quantitatively comparing the
automatically extracted topics, intents and tagged categories with human tagged

Recently, there have been great improvements for the video game AIs on the
playing strength. However, past researches for analyzing the behaviors of
players still used heuristic rules or the behavior features with the
game-environment support, thus being exhausted for the developers to define the
features of discriminating various playstyles. In this paper, we propose the
first metric for video game playstyles directly from the game observations and
actions, without any prior specification on the playstyle in the target game.
Our proposed method is built upon a novel scheme of learning discrete
representations that can map game observations into latent discrete states,
such that playstyles can be exhibited from these discrete states. Namely, we
measure the playstyle distance based on game observations aligned to the same
states. We demonstrate high playstyle accuracy of our metric in experiments on
some video game platforms, including TORCS, RGSK, and seven Atari games, and
for different agents including rule-based AI bots, learning-based AI bots, and
human players.

interest, DMI-clustering is a general clustering method that aims to maximize
the volume of the simplex consisting of each cluster's mean multiplying the

non-degenerate affine transformation for all data points. When the data point's
dimension is a constant, DMI-clustering can be solved in polynomial time. In

fingerprint recognition systems. Most fingerprint matching algorithms are
minutiae-based. The minutiae in fingerprints can be determined by their
discontinuity. Ridge ending and ridge bifurcation are two frequently used
minutiae in most fingerprint-based matching algorithms.
  This paper presents a new minutiae-based fingerprint matching using the onion
peeling approach. In the proposed method, fingerprints are aligned to find the
matched minutiae points. Then, the nested convex polygons of matched minutiae
points are constructed and the comparison between peer-to-peer polygons is
performed by the turning function distance. Simplicity, accuracy, and low time
complexity of the Onion peeling approach are three important factors that make
it a standard method for fingerprint matching purposes. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is evaluated on the database $FVC2002$. The results show
that fingerprints of the same fingers have higher scores than different
fingers. Since the fingerprints that the difference between the number of their
layers is more than $2$ and the minutiae matching score lower than 0.15 are
ignored, the better results are obtained.

itself needs a leader. Carousel uses the available on-chain information to
determine a leader locally and achieves Liveness despite this difficulty. A
HotStuff implementation fitted with Carousel demonstrates drastic performance

representation of the electronic response that is ideally suited for
determining the ground state of weakly interacting molecules using a VQA. We
require qubit numbers that grow linearly with the number of molecules and
derive scaling behaviour for the number of circuits and measurements required,

which quantum computers can model Van der Waals interactions directly from
zero-point quantum fluctuations. Within this coarse-grained approximation, we
conclude that current-generation quantum hardware is capable of probing
energies in this weakly bound but nevertheless chemically ubiquitous and
biologically important regime. Finally, we perform experiments on simulated and

as oscillators with anharmonic onsite binding potentials; the consequences of

zero-shot low-light enhancement network (SGZ) which is trained in the absence
of paired images, unpaired datasets, and segmentation annotation. Firstly, we
design an enhancement factor extraction network using depthwise separable
convolution for an efficient estimate of the pixel-wise light deficiency of an
low-light image. Secondly, we propose a recurrent image enhancement network to
progressively enhance the low-light image with affordable model size. Finally,
we introduce an unsupervised semantic segmentation network for preserving the
semantic information during intensive enhancement. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets and a low-light video demonstrate that our model outperforms
the previous state-of-the-art. We further discuss the benefits of the proposed

applications. Most existing GNNs assume strong homophily of graph structure and
apply permutation-invariant local aggregation of neighbors to learn a
representation for each node. However, they fail to generalize to heterophilic
graphs, where most neighboring nodes have different labels or features, and the
relevant nodes are distant. Few recent studies attempt to address this problem
by combining multiple hops of hidden representations of central nodes (i.e.,
multi-hop-based approaches) or sorting the neighboring nodes based on attention
scores (i.e., ranking-based approaches). As a result, these approaches have
some apparent limitations. On the one hand, multi-hop-based approaches do not
explicitly distinguish relevant nodes from a large number of multi-hop
neighborhoods, leading to a severe over-smoothing problem. On the other hand,
ranking-based models do not joint-optimize node ranking with end tasks and
result in sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we present Graph Pointer Neural
Networks (GPNN) to tackle the challenges mentioned above. We leverage a pointer
network to select the most relevant nodes from a large amount of multi-hop
neighborhoods, which constructs an ordered sequence according to the
relationship with the central node. 1D convolution is then applied to extract
high-level features from the node sequence. The pointer-network-based ranker in
GPNN is joint-optimized with other parts in an end-to-end manner. Extensive
experiments are conducted on six public node classification datasets with
heterophilic graphs. The results show that GPNN significantly improves the

noise estimation becomes more complicated due to the effect of the image

denoising method with total variation regularization. Meanwhile, we learn the
noise level map by unrolling the corresponding minimization process for
providing the inferences of smoothness and fidelity constraints. Guided by the
noise level map, our UTVNet can recover finer details and is more capable to
suppress noise in real captured low-light scenes. Extensive experiments on

from an RGB image. This is often an ill-posed problem, since multiple plausible
3D bodies may match the visual evidence present in the input - particularly
when the subject is occluded. Thus, it is desirable to estimate a distribution
over 3D body shape and pose conditioned on the input image instead of a single
3D reconstruction. We train a deep neural network to estimate a hierarchical
matrix-Fisher distribution over relative 3D joint rotation matrices (i.e. body
pose), which exploits the human body's kinematic tree structure, as well as a
Gaussian distribution over SMPL body shape parameters. To further ensure that
the predicted shape and pose distributions match the visual evidence in the
input image, we implement a differentiable rejection sampler to impose a
reprojection loss between ground-truth 2D joint coordinates and samples from
the predicted distributions, projected onto the image plane. We show that our
method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of 3D shape and pose
metrics on the SSP-3D and 3DPW datasets, while also yielding a structured
probability distribution over 3D body shape and pose, with which we can
meaningfully quantify prediction uncertainty and sample multiple plausible 3D
reconstructions to explain a given input image. Code is available at

While a large variety of RNN models were proposed in the literature, it is
unclear if complex architecture innovations will offer superior predictive

various methods is needed. In this study, we conducted a thorough benchmark of
RNN architectures in modeling EHR data. We used two prediction tasks: the risk

  Value Decomposition",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a randomized QLP decomposition called Rand-QLP.
Operating on a matrix $\bf A$, Rand-QLP gives ${\bf A}={\bf QLP}^T$, where $\bf
Q$ and $\bf P$ are orthonormal, and $\bf L$ is lower-triangular. Under the
assumption that the rank of the input matrix is $k$, we derive several error
bounds for Rand-QLP: bounds for the first $k$ approximate singular values and
for the trailing block of the middle factor $\bf L$, which show that the
decomposition is rank-revealing; bounds for the distance between approximate
subspaces and the exact ones for all four fundamental subspaces of a given
matrix; and bounds for the errors of low-rank approximations constructed by the
columns of $\bf Q$ and $\bf P$. Rand-QLP is able to effectively leverage modern
computational architectures, due to the utilization of random sampling and the
unpivoted QR decomposition, thus addressing a serious bottleneck associated
with classical algorithms such as the singular value decomposition (SVD),
column-pivoted QR (CPQR) and most recent matrix decomposition algorithms. To
assess the performance behavior of different algorithms, we use an Intel Xeon
Gold 6240 CPU running at 2.6 GHz with a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU. In
comparison to CPQR and the SVD, Rand-QLP respectively achieves a speedup of up
to 5 times and 6.6 times on the CPU and up to 3.8 times and 4.4 times with the
hybrid GPU architecture. In terms of quality of approximation, our results on
synthetic and real data show that the approximations by Rand-QLP are comparable
to those of pivoted QLP and the optimal SVD, and in most cases are considerably
better than those of CPQR.

measuring the relative time delays between multiple images of
gravitationally-lensed quasars. A few of such systems have already been used to
measure $H_0$: their time delays were determined from the multiple images light
curves obtained by regular, years long, monitoring campaigns. Such campaigns
can hardly be performed by any telescope: many facilities are often
over-subscribed with a large amount of observational requests to fulfill. While
the ideal systems for time-delay measurements are lensed quasars whose images
are well resolved by the instruments, several lensed quasars have a small
angular separation between the multiple images, and would appear as a single,
unresolved, image to a large number of telescopes featuring poor angular
resolutions or located in not privileged geographical locations. Methods
allowing to infer the time delay also from unresolved light curves would boost
the potential of such telescopes and greatly increase the available statistics
for $H_0$ measurements. This work presents a study of unresolved lensed quasar
systems to estimate the time delay using a deep learning-based approach that
exploits the capabilities of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks.
Experiments on state-of-the-art simulations of unresolved light curves show the
potential of the proposed method and pave the way for future applications in
time-delay cosmography.

distributions. To reduce these language biases, recent VQA works introduce an
auxiliary question-only model to regularize the training of targeted VQA model,
and achieve dominating performance on diagnostic benchmarks for
out-of-distribution testing. However, due to complex model design, these
ensemble-based methods are unable to equip themselves with two indispensable
characteristics of an ideal VQA model: 1) Visual-explainable: The model should
rely on the right visual regions when making decisions. 2) Question-sensitive:
The model should be sensitive to the linguistic variations in questions. To
this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing
and Training (CSST) strategy. After training with CSST, VQA models are forced
to focus on all critical objects and words, which significantly improves both
visual-explainable and question-sensitive abilities. Specifically, CSST is
composed of two parts: Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CSS) and
Counterfactual Samples Training (CST). CSS generates counterfactual samples by
carefully masking critical objects in images or words in questions and
assigning pseudo ground-truth answers. CST not only trains the VQA models with
both complementary samples to predict respective ground-truth answers, but also
urges the VQA models to further distinguish the original samples and
superficially similar counterfactual ones. To facilitate the CST training, we
propose two variants of supervised contrastive loss for VQA, and design an
effective positive and negative sample selection mechanism based on CSS.
Extensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of CSST. Particularly, by
building on top of model LMH+SAR, we achieve record-breaking performance on all
OOD benchmarks.

is based on the U-Net framework. First, we use EfficientNetB4 as the encoder to
extract more feature information during the encoding stage. Then, an attention
gate is introduced in the skip connection to eliminate irrelevant regions and
highlight features of a specific segmentation task. Finally, to alleviate the
problem of gradient vanishment, we replace the traditional convolution of the

verified the proposed method on the LiTS17 and SLiver07 datasets and compared
it with classical networks such as FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Attention

segmentation performance on all five standard metrics. Meanwhile, in the LiTS17

Evryscope archival data show that there is a strong periodicity of the dips at

substantially. Statistical analysis of the ASAS-SN data shows that the dips
only occur sporadically at a detectable threshold in approximately one out of

occulter is a sporadically-emitted dust cloud. The cloud is also fairly
optically thick, blocking up to 37% or 75% of the light from the host star,

unresolved. While the (two-step) process of breakup followed by capture of the

few recent studies suggest the dominant role of (direct) cluster stripping. To
achieve an unambiguous experimental discrimination between these two processes,
a coincidence measurement between the outgoing $\alpha$ particles and $\gamma$
rays from the heavy residues has been performed for the
$^7$Li($\alpha$+triton)+$^{93}$Nb system. Proper choice of kinematical
conditions allowed for the first time a significant population of the region
accessible only to the direct triton stripping process and not to breakup
followed by the capture of the ``free'' triton (from the three-body continuum).
This result, also supported by a cluster-transfer calculation, clearly
establishes the dominance of the direct cluster-stripping mechanism in the
large alpha production.

of selected variables (called a ""selection dictionary"") is desirable due to the
inherent structural constraints among the candidate variables. The methods that
can incorporate such restrictions can improve model interpretability and
prediction accuracy. Penalized regression can integrate selection rules by
assigning the coefficients to different groups and then applying penalties to
the groups. However, no general framework has been proposed to formalize
selection rules and their applications. In this work, we establish a framework
for structured variable selection that can incorporate universal structural
constraints. We develop a mathematical language for constructing arbitrary
selection rules, where the selection dictionary is formally defined. We show
that all selection rules can be represented as a combination of operations on
constructs, which can be used to identify the related selection dictionary. One
may then apply some criteria to select the best model. We show that the
theoretical framework can help to identify the grouping structure in existing
penalized regression methods. In addition, we formulate structured variable
selection into mixed-integer optimization problems which can be solved by
existing software. Finally, we discuss the significance of the framework in the
context of statistics.

uncertainty of the degradation patterns. This paper proposes a Restoration with
Memorized Modulation (RMM) framework for universal BFR in diverse degraded
scenes and heterogeneous domains. We apply random noise as well as unsupervised
wavelet memory to adaptively modulate the face-enhancement generator,
considering attentional denormalization in both layer and instance levels.
Specifically, in the training stage, the low-level spatial feature embedding,
the wavelet memory embedding obtained by wavelet transformation of the
high-resolution image, as well as the disentangled high-level noise embeddings
are integrated, with the guidance of attentional maps generated from layer
normalization, instance normalization, and the original feature map. These
three embeddings are respectively associated with the spatial content,
high-frequency texture details, and a learnable universal prior against other
blind image degradation patterns. We store the spatial feature of the
low-resolution image and the corresponding wavelet style code as key and value
in the memory unit, respectively. In the test stage, the wavelet memory value
whose corresponding spatial key is the most matching with that of the inferred
image is retrieved to modulate the generator. Moreover, the universal prior
learned from the random noise has been memorized by training the modulation
network. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method
compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and a good generalization in the

solve the problem, increasingly deep learning methods are proposed to forecast
future radar echo images and then the predicted maps have converted the
distribution of rainfall. The prevailing spatiotemporal sequence prediction
methods apply ConvRNN structure which combines the Convolution and Recurrent
neural network. Although improvements based on ConvRNN achieve remarkable
success, these methods ignore capturing both local and global spatial features
simultaneously, which degrades the nowcasting in the region of heavy rainfall.
To address this issue, we proposed the Region Attention Block (RAB) and embed
it into ConvRNN to enhance the forecast in the area with strong rainfall.
Besides, the ConvRNN models are hard to memory longer history representations
with limited parameters. Considering it, we propose Recall Attention Mechanism
(RAM) to improve the prediction. By preserving longer temporal information, RAM
contributes to the forecasting, especially in the middle rainfall intensity.
The experiments show that the proposed model Region Attention Predictive

massive parallel computational power of GPUs to accelerate physically based

simulations and it easily becomes intractable as the number of vertices in the

in GPUs, their complexity discourages from using such approaches. Acceleration
structures -- such as BVH -- are often applied to increase performance,
achieving logarithmic computational times for individual point queries.
Nonetheless, their memory footprint also grows rapidly and their
parallelization in a GPU is problematic due to their branching nature. We
propose using implicit surface representations learnt through deep learning for
collision handling in physically based simulations. Our proposed architecture

epidemic and for imposing policy interventions to curb the increase when R >1.
While R is easy to interpret in a fully susceptible population, it is more
difficult to interpret for a population with heterogeneous prior immunity,

Hospitalisations are shown to be consistently representative, however, the

due to their unique advantages over traditional material modeling. Deep neural
networks are able to learn complex material response without the constraints of
closed-form approximations. However, imposing the physics-based mathematical
requirements that any material model must comply with is not straightforward
for data-driven approaches. In this study, we use a novel class of neural
networks, known as neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), to develop
data-driven material models that automatically satisfy polyconvexity of the
strain energy function with respect to the deformation gradient, a condition
needed for the existence of minimizers for boundary value problems in
elasticity. We take advantage of the properties of ordinary differential
equations to create monotonic functions that approximate the derivatives of the
strain energy function with respect to the invariants of the right Cauchy-Green
deformation tensor. The monotonicity of the derivatives guarantees the
convexity of the energy. The N-ODE material model is able to capture synthetic
data generated from closed-form material models, and it outperforms
conventional models when tested against experimental data on skin, a highly
nonlinear and anisotropic material. We also showcase the use of the N-ODE
material model in finite element simulations. The framework is general and can
be used to model a large class of materials. Here we focus on hyperelasticity,
but polyconvex strain energies are a core building block for other problems in
elasticity such as viscous and plastic deformations. We therefore expect our
methodology to further enable data-driven methods in computational mechanics

giving the position and momentum for each constituent particle. For
non-pointlike particles, the center-of-mass position may be augmented by an
additional coordinate that specifies the internal state of each particle. The
internal state space is typically topologically simple, in the sense that the
particle's internal coordinate belongs to a suitable symmetry group. In this
paper we explore the idea of giving internal complexity to the particles, by
attributing to each particle an internal state space that is represented by a
point on a strange (or otherwise) attracting set. It is of course very well
known that strange attractors arise in a variety of nonlinear dynamical
systems. However, rather than considering strange attractors as emerging from
complex dynamics, we may employ strange attractors to {\em drive} such
dynamics. In particular, by using an attractor (strange or otherwise) to model
each particle's internal state space, we present a class of matter coined
``attractor-driven matter''. We outline the general formalism for
attractor-driven matter and explore several specific examples, some of which
are reminiscent of active matter. Beyond the examples studied in this paper,
our formalism for attractor-driven dynamics may be applicable more broadly, to
model complex dynamical and emergent behaviors in a variety of contexts.

  Prediction of Landslide Susceptibility",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting a landslide susceptibility map (LSM) is essential for risk
recognition and disaster prevention. Despite the successful application of
data-driven approaches for LSM prediction, most methods generally apply a
single global model to predict the LSM for an entire target region. However, in
large-scale areas with significant environmental change, various parts of the
region hold different landslide-inducing environments, and therefore, should be
predicted with respective models. This study first segmented target scenarios
into blocks for individual analysis. Then, the critical problem is that in each
block with limited samples, conducting training and testing a model is
impossible for a satisfactory LSM prediction, especially in dangerous
mountainous areas where landslide surveying is expensive. To solve the problem,
we trained an intermediate representation by the meta-learning paradigm, which
is superior for capturing information valuable for few-shot adaption from LSM
tasks. We hypothesized that there are more general and vital concepts
concerning landslide causes and are sensitive to variations in input features.
Thus, we can quickly few-shot adapt the models from the intermediate
representation for different blocks or even unseen tasks using very few
exemplar samples. Experimental results on the two study areas demonstrated the
validity of our block-wise analysis in large scenarios and revealed the top
few-shot adaption performances of the proposed methods.

per-line power. Optical amplifiers can be used to overcome power limitations,
but the accompanying spontaneous optical noise can degrade performance in
optical systems. To overcome this, we demonstrate wideband noise reduction for
comb lines using a high-Q microring resonator whose resonances align with the
comb lines, providing tight optical filtering of multiple combs lines at the
same time. By distilling an optical frequency comb in this way, we are able to
reduce the required comb line OSNR when these lines are used in a coherent
optical communications system. Through performance tests on a 19.45-GHz-spaced
comb generating 71 lines, using 18 Gbaud, 64-QAM sub-channels at a spectral
efficiency of 10.6 b/s/Hz, we find that noise-corrupted comb lines can reduce
the optical signal-to-noise ratio required for the comb by ~ 9 dB when used as
optical carriers at the transmitter side, and by ~ 12 dB when used as a local
oscillator at the receiver side. This demonstration provides a method to enable

viewers during an event, we implement a prioritized replay memory buffer based
on the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the reward/throughput of the viewers'

generate a global model from past events. As viewers scarcely participate in
several events, the challenge resides on how to account for the low structural
similarity of different events. To combat this issue, we design a graph
signature buffer to calculate the structural similarities of several streaming

inspection shows that the slopes are not truly straight, instead, more often
they have convex shapes, although with small convexity. Similar curvature is
observed on the sand dunes' surfaces. We derive equations together with
experiments on 10 types of granular materials to show that, in general, the
slope of the granular heap is convex while the straight slope is a critical
state that rarely occurs. The angle of repose is allowed to vary within a
narrow range around a critical value. If the angle of repose is slightly
greater (smaller) than the critical value, the slope is convex (concave). The
model also answers why the surfaces of granular heaps, including sand dunes,
are more often convex rather than concave or straight, and advocate the
simultaneous estimation of the coefficient of friction on the grain and the
type of packing in the heap. The results might open new understandings related
