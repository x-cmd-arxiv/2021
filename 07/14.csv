computational complexity of quantum physics at the thermodynamic limit. Even
defining the problem is not straight forward. We study the complexity of
estimating the ground energy of a fixed, translationally invariant Hamiltonian
in the thermodynamic limit, to within a given precision; the number of bits $n$
for the precision is the sole input to the problem. The complexity of this
problem captures how difficult it is for the physicist to measure or compute
another digit in the approximation of a physical quantity in the thermodynamic
limit. We show that this problem is contained in $\mbox{FEXP}^{\mbox{QMA-EXP}}$
and is hard for $\mbox{FEXP}^{\mbox{NEXP}}$. This means that the problem is
doubly exponentially hard in the size of the input. As an ingredient in our
construction, we study the problem of computing the ground energy of
translationally invariant finite 1D chains. A single Hamiltonian term, which is
a fixed parameter of the problem, is applied to every pair of particles in a
finite chain. The length of the chain is the sole input to the problem and the
task is to compute an approximation of the ground energy. No thresholds are
provided as in the standard formulation of the local Hamiltonian problem. We
show that this problem is contained in $\mbox{FP}^{\mbox{QMA-EXP}}$ and is hard
for $\mbox{FP}^{\mbox{NEXP}}$. Our techniques employ a circular clock in which
the ground energy is calibrated by the length of the cycle. This requires more
precise expressions for the ground states of the resulting matrices than was
required for previous QMA-completeness constructions and even exact analytical
bounds for the infinite case which we derive using techniques from spectral
graph theory. To our knowledge, this is the first use of the
circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction which shows hardness for a function class.

our pipeline can provide a perception of high-resolution refocused images with
minimal aliasing by jointly optimizing the sub-aperture views for display and

To our knowledge, this work is among the first that optimize the light field

to the introduction of ML concepts at multiple levels of education including
K-12 students to promote computational thinking. However, teaching these
concepts to K-12 through traditional methodologies such as video lectures and

interactive environments such as games to teach computational thinking and
programming improves retention capacity and motivation among students.
Therefore, introducing ML concepts using a game might enhance students'
understanding of the subject and motivate them to learn further. However, we
are not aware of any existing game which explicitly focuses on introducing ML
concepts to students using game play. Hence, in this paper, we propose
ML-Quest, a 3D video game to provide conceptual overview of three ML concepts:
Supervised Learning, Gradient Descent and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

without overwhelming students with the intricacies of ML. The game has been
predominantly evaluated for its usefulness and player experience using the

networks (CNN) can represent incredibly complex nonlinear functions which map
between combinations of images and scalars. For example, CNNs can be used to
map combinations of accelerator parameters and images which are 2D projections
of the 6D phase space distributions of charged particle beams as they are
transported between various particle accelerator locations. Despite their
strengths, applying ML to time-varying systems, or systems with shifting
distributions, is an open problem, especially for large systems for which
collecting new data for re-training is impractical or interrupts operations.
Particle accelerators are one example of large time-varying systems for which
collecting detailed training data requires lengthy dedicated beam measurements
which may no longer be available during regular operations. We present a
recently developed method of adaptive ML for time-varying systems. Our approach
is to map very high (N>100k) dimensional inputs (a combination of scalar
parameters and images) into the low dimensional (N~2) latent space at the
output of the encoder section of an encoder-decoder CNN. We then actively tune
the low dimensional latent space-based representation of complex system
dynamics by the addition of an adaptively tuned feedback vector directly before
the decoder sections builds back up to our image-based high-dimensional phase
space density representations. This method allows us to learn correlations
within and to quickly tune the characteristics of incredibly high parameter
systems and to track their evolution in real time based on feedback without
massive new data sets for re-training.

consider how to train an artificial neural network potential to describe
inhomogeneous, disordered systems. We find that neural network potentials based
on local representations of atomic environments are capable of describing some
properties of liquid-vapor interfaces, but typically fail for properties that
depend on unbalanced long-ranged interactions which build up in the presence of
broken translation symmetry. These same interactions cancel in the
translationally invariant bulk, allowing local neural network potentials to
describe bulk properties correctly. By incorporating explicit models of the
slowly-varying long-ranged interactions and training neural networks only on
the short ranged components, we can arrive at potentials that robustly recover
interfacial properties. We find that local neural network models can sometimes
approximate a local molecular field potential to correct for the truncated
interactions, but this behavior is variable and hard to learn. Generally, we
find that models with explicit electrostatics are easier to train and have
higher accuracy. We demonstrate this perspective in a simple model of an
asymmetric dipolar fluid where the exact long-ranged interaction is known, and
in an ab initio water model where it is approximated.

ambiguities caused by saturation, motion, and various artifacts introduced

An efficient two-stream structure is proposed which separately focuses on
texture feature transfer over saturated regions and multi-exposure tonal and
texture feature fusion. A neural feature transfer mechanism is proposed which
establishes spatial correspondence between different exposures based on
multi-scale VGG features in the masked saturated HDR domain for discriminative
contextual clues over the ambiguous image areas. A progressive texture blending
module is designed to blend the encoded two-stream features in a multi-scale
and progressive manner. In addition, we introduce several novel attention
mechanisms, i.e., the motion attention module detects and suppresses the
content discrepancies among the reference images; the saturation attention
module facilitates differentiating the misalignment caused by saturation from
those caused by motion; and the scale attention module ensures texture blending
consistency between different coder/decoder scales. We carry out comprehensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluations and ablation studies, which validate
that these novel modules work coherently under the same framework and
outperform state-of-the-art methods.

result is that the heavy-tailed degree distribution of the contact networks
causes a targeted vaccination strategy that prioritizes high-contact

that vaccinates individuals at random. Combining both targeted vaccination and
social distancing leads to the greatest reduction in cases, and we also find
that the marginal benefit of a targeted strategy as compared to a random
strategy exceeds the marginal benefit of social distancing for reducing the

domains generalize better on unseen target domains. The performances of current
DG methods largely rely on sufficient labeled data, which are usually costly or
unavailable, however. Since unlabeled data are far more accessible, we seek to
explore how unsupervised learning can help deep models generalize across
domains. Specifically, we study a novel generalization problem called
unsupervised domain generalization (UDG), which aims to learn generalizable
models with unlabeled data and analyze the effects of pre-training on DG. In
UDG, models are pretrained with unlabeled data from various source domains
before being trained on labeled source data and eventually tested on unseen
target domains. Then we propose a method named Domain-Aware Representation
LearnING (DARLING) to cope with the significant and misleading heterogeneity
within unlabeled pretraining data and severe distribution shifts between source
and target data. Surprisingly we observe that DARLING can not only
counterbalance the scarcity of labeled data but also further strengthen the
generalization ability of models when the labeled data are insufficient. As a
pretraining approach, DARLING shows superior or comparable performance compared
with ImageNet pretraining protocol even when the available data are unlabeled
and of a vastly smaller amount compared to ImageNet, which may shed light on
improving generalization with large-scale unlabeled data.

different sizes of the regions from which they originate. Focusing on the most
common BELs in our spectra (C IV, C III], and Mg II), we find that the
low-ionization line Mg II is only weakly affected by microlensing. In contrast,
the high-ionization line C IV shows strong microlensing in some cases,
indicating that its emission region is more compact. Thus, the BEL profiles are
deformed differently depending on the geometry and kinematics of the
corresponding emitting region. We detect microlensing in either the blue or the
red wing (or in both wings with different amplitudes) of C IV in more than 50%
of the systems and find outstanding asymmetries in the wings of QSO 0957+561,

effects by using genetic variants as instrumental variables. We propose a new
MR method, GENIUS-MAWII, which simultaneously addresses the two salient
phenomena that adversely affect MR analyses: many weak instruments and
widespread horizontal pleiotropy. Similar to MR GENIUS (Tchetgen Tchetgen et
al., 2021), we achieve identification of the treatment effect by leveraging
heteroscedasticity of the exposure. We then derive the class of influence
functions of the treatment effect, based on which, we construct a continuous
updating estimator and establish its consistency and asymptotic normality under
a many weak invalid instruments asymptotic regime by developing novel
semiparametric theory. We also provide a measure of weak identification, an
overidentification test, and a graphical diagnostic tool. We demonstrate in
simulations that GENIUS-MAWII has clear advantages in the presence of
directional or correlated horizontal pleiotropy compared to other methods. We
apply our method to study the effect of body mass index on systolic blood
pressure using UK Biobank.

parametric human mesh to images of obese people. Despite obese person mesh
fitting being an important problem with numerous applications (e.g.,
healthcare), much recent progress in mesh recovery has been restricted to
images of non-obese people. In this work, we identify this crucial gap in the
current literature by presenting and discussing limitations of existing
algorithms. Next, we present a simple baseline to address this problem that is
scalable and can be easily used in conjunction with existing algorithms to
improve their performance. Finally, we present a generalized human mesh
optimization algorithm that substantially improves the performance of existing
methods on both obese person images as well as community-standard benchmark
datasets. A key innovation of this technique is that it does not rely on
supervision from expensive-to-create mesh parameters. Instead, starting from
widely and cheaply available 2D keypoints annotations, our method automatically
generates mesh parameters that can in turn be used to re-train and fine-tune
any existing mesh estimation algorithm. This way, we show our method acts as a
drop-in to improve the performance of a wide variety of contemporary mesh
estimation methods. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets
comprising both standard and obese person images and demonstrate the efficacy

collapse supernovae (SNe). We present a simple analytical method to estimate
the number of SNe required to have occurred in a GC from its metallicity and
iron abundance spread. We then use this result to estimate how long star
formation (SF) lasted to build the GC. We apply our method to up-to-date
measurements and find that, assuming the correctness of these measurements,
multiple SNe (up to $10^5$) are required in most GCs with iron abundance
spreads. The number of SNe events which contributed to the enrichment of the
GCs studied here is typically a factor of 10 less than the expected number of
SNe in a canonical initial mass function (IMF). This indicates that gas
expulsion from the forming GC occurred after the first 10 per cent of SNe
exploded. We compute that for the GCs typically SF ends after only a few Myr
(extending up to $\approx 30 ~\rm Myr$ in a few cases). We also discuss
possible improvements of this method and especially its sensitivity to the
error of iron abundance measurements of individual stars of a GC. The method

explain the iron abundance spread in a GC without the requirement of any

well-characterized particle size distributions in solution. But, this property
can prove difficult to measure. High-throughput methods, such as dynamic light
scattering, detect nanoparticles in solution with an efficiency that scales
with diameter to the sixth power. This diminishes the accuracy of any
determination that must span a range of particle sizes. The accurate
classification of broadly distributed systems thus requires very large numbers
of measurements. Mass-filtered particle-sensing techniques offer a better
dynamic range, but are labor-intensive and so have low throughput. Progress in
many areas of nanotechnology requires a faster, lower-cost, and more accurate
measure of particle size distributions, particularly for diameters smaller than
20 nm. Here, we present a tailored interferometric microscope system, combined
with a high-speed image-processing strategy, optimized for real-time particle
tracking that determines accurate size distributions in nominal 5, 10, and 15
nm colloidal gold nanoparticle systems by automatically sensing and classifying
thousands of single particles sampled from solution at rates as high as 4,000

Variations in the single-particle signal as a function of time and mass,

emission from novae is a mixture of thermal and synchrotron emission, with
non-thermal emission observed at earlier times. We identify high brightness

programs. While bottom-up synthesis techniques can work better than top-down
methods in certain settings, there is no prior technique for synthesizing
recursive programs from logical specifications in a purely bottom-up fashion.
The main challenge is that effective bottom-up methods need to execute
sub-expressions of the code being synthesized, but it is impossible to execute
a recursive subexpression of a program that has not been fully constructed yet.
In this paper, we address this challenge using the concept of angelic
semantics. Specifically, our method finds a program that satisfies the
specification under angelic semantics (we refer to this as angelic synthesis),
analyzes the assumptions made during its angelic execution, uses this analysis
to strengthen the specification, and finally reattempts synthesis with the
strengthened specification. Our proposed angelic synthesis algorithm is based
on version space learning and therefore deals effectively with many incremental
synthesis calls made during the overall algorithm. We have implemented this
approach in a prototype called Burst and evaluate it on synthesis problems from
prior work. Our experiments show that Burst is able to synthesize a solution to
94% of the benchmarks in our benchmark suite, outperforming prior work.

that the best-fit model fit indicates that asteroid grain sizes are inversely
dependent on object size for <10 km asteroids and exhibits no relationship
above this size cutoff. Rotation period and grain size show a positive
relationship when the rotation period is greater than ~5 hr, and an inverse
relationship below this rotation period. We conclude that both impact
weathering and thermal fatigue are significant regolith evolution mechanisms.

RetinaNet (GPS-RetinaNet), which predicts a positional offset for each sign
relative to the camera, in addition to performing the standard classification
and bounding box regression. Candidate sign detections from GPS-RetinaNet are
condensed into geolocalized signs by our custom tracker, which consists of a
learned metric network and a variant of the Hungarian Algorithm. Our metric
network estimates the similarity between pairs of detections, then the
Hungarian Algorithm matches detections across images using the similarity
scores provided by the metric network. Our models were trained using an updated
version of the ARTS dataset, which contains 25,544 images and 47.589 sign

environments gathered from a broad selection of roads. Each annotaiton contains
a sign class label, its geospatial location, an assembly label, a side of road
indicator, and unique identifiers that aid in the evaluation. This dataset will
support future progress in the field, and the proposed system demonstrates how
to take advantage of some of the unique characteristics of a realistic

attention in recent years, there remain numerous open challenges in this field.
The gap between existing simulation platforms that mainly concentrate on
single-vehicle intelligence and CDA development is one of the critical
barriers, as it inhibits researchers from validating and comparing different
CDA algorithms conveniently. To this end, we propose OpenCDA, a generalized
framework and tool for developing and testing CDA systems. Specifically,
OpenCDA is composed of three major components: a co-simulation platform with
simulators of different purposes and resolutions, a full-stack cooperative
driving system, and a scenario manager. Through the interactions of these three
components, our framework offers a straightforward way for researchers to test
different CDA algorithms at both levels of traffic and individual autonomy.
More importantly, OpenCDA is highly modularized and installed with benchmark
algorithms and test cases. Users can conveniently replace any default module
with customized algorithms and use other default modules of the CDA platform to
perform evaluations of the effectiveness of new functionalities in enhancing
the overall CDA performance. An example of platooning implementation is used to
illustrate the framework's capability for CDA research. The codes of OpenCDA
are available in the https://github.com/ucla-mobility/OpenCDA.

  exponential dependencies on $1/\epsilon$",,,,,"cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider a classical scheduling problem on $m$ identical machines. For an
arbitrary constant $q>1$, the aim is to assign jobs to machines such that
$\sum_{i=1}^m C_i^q$ is minimized, where $C_i$ is the total processing time of
jobs assigned to machine $i$. It is well known that this problem is strongly
NP-hard.
  Under mild assumptions, the running time of an $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for a strongly NP-hard problem cannot be polynomial on $1/\epsilon$,
unless $\text{P}=\text{NP}$. For most problems in the literature, this
translates into algorithms with running time at least as large as
$2^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}+n^{O(1)}$. For the natural scheduling problem above,
we establish the existence of an algorithm which violates this threshold. More
precisely, we design a PTAS that runs in
$2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})}+n^{O(1)}$ time. This result is in sharp
contrast to the closely related minimum makespan variant, where an exponential
lower bound is known under the exponential time hypothesis (ETH). We complement
our result with an essentially matching lower bound on the running time,
showing that our algorithm is best-possible under ETH. The lower bound proof
exploits new number-theoretical constructions for variants of progression-free
sets, which might be of independent interest.
  Furthermore, we provide a fine-grained characterization on the running time
of a PTAS for this problem depending on the relation between $\epsilon$ and the
number of machines $m$. More precisely, our lower bound only holds when
$m=\Theta(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$. Better algorithms, that go beyond the lower
bound, exist for other values of $m$. In particular, there even exists an
algorithm with running time polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ if we restrict ourselves
to instances with $m=\Omega(1/\epsilon\log^21/\epsilon)$.

Signature of short-range magnetic correlation induced by 5/2-5/2 dimeric
interaction and magnetic anomaly at 150 K is perceived apart from the familiar
sharp transition (TN~210K) corresponding to long-range order by magnetization
and heat capacity measurement. The magnetic transitions and the spin dynamics
are further locally probed by muon spin resonance ({\mu}SR) measurement in both
zero fields (ZF) and longitudinal field (LF) mode. Three dynamically distinct
temperature regimes; (i) T >TN, (ii) TN>T>150 K, and (iii) T<150 K, are
observed. A swift change in spin dynamics is realized at 150K by {\mu}SR,
though previous studies suggest long-range antiferromagnetic order. The
observation of renormalization of different Raman modes below 210K suggests the
existence of spin-phonon coupling in the material. The coupling strength is
quantified as in the range 0.1-1.2 cm-1 following the two-spin cluster

learning (RL) systems in the real world. In this paper, we show that the
sequential structure of the RL problem necessitates new approaches to
generalization beyond the well-studied techniques used in supervised learning.
While supervised learning methods can generalize effectively without explicitly
accounting for epistemic uncertainty, we show that, perhaps surprisingly, this
is not the case in RL. We show that generalization to unseen test conditions
from a limited number of training conditions induces implicit partial
observability, effectively turning even fully-observed MDPs into POMDPs.
Informed by this observation, we recast the problem of generalization in RL as
solving the induced partially observed Markov decision process, which we call
the epistemic POMDP. We demonstrate the failure modes of algorithms that do not
appropriately handle this partial observability, and suggest a simple
ensemble-based technique for approximately solving the partially observed
problem. Empirically, we demonstrate that our simple algorithm derived from the
epistemic POMDP achieves significant gains in generalization over current
methods on the Procgen benchmark suite.

Lieb concavity theorem from matrices to T product tensors. This new version of
Lieb concavity theorem under T product tensor will be used to determine the
tail bound for the maximum eigenvalue induced by independent sums of random
Hermitian T product, which is the key tool to derive various new tail bounds
for random T product tensors. Besides, Qi et. al introduces a new concept,
named eigentuple, about T product tensors and they apply this concept to study
nonnegative (positive) definite properties of T product tensors. The final main
contribution of this work is to develop the Courant Fischer Theorem with
respect to eigentuples, and this theorem helps us to understand the
relationship between the minimum eigentuple and the maximum eigentuple. The
main content of this paper is Part I of a serious task about T product tensors.
The Part II of this work will utilize these new inequalities and Courant
Fischer Theorem under T product tensors to derive tail bounds of the extreme

estimators for the unwindowed bispectrum; a quantity that can be

non-Gaussianity, the estimator is minimum-variance; furthermore, we give an
alternate form based on FKP weights that is close-to-optimal and easy to

luminosity standardization would not show {absolute magnitude differences} with
progenitor age. Unlike this expectation, recent age datings of stellar
populations in host galaxies have shown significant correlations between
progenitor age and Hubble residual (HR). Here we show that this correlation
originates from a strong progenitor age dependence of the zero-points of the
WLR and the CLR, in the sense that SNe from younger progenitors are fainter
each at given light-curve parameters $x_1$ and $c$. This $4.6\sigma$ result is
reminiscent of Baade's discovery of the zero-point variation of the Cepheid
period-luminosity relation with age, and, as such, causes a serious systematic
bias with redshift in SN cosmology. Other host properties show substantially
smaller and insignificant offsets in the WLR and CLR for the same dataset. We
illustrate that the differences between the high-$z$ and low-$z$ SNe in the WLR
and CLR, and in HR after the standardization, are fully comparable to those
between the correspondingly young and old SNe at intermediate redshift,
indicating that the observed dimming of SNe with redshift may well be an
artifact of over-correction in the luminosity standardization. When this
systematic bias with redshift is properly taken into account, there is little
evidence left for an accelerating universe, in discordance with other probes,
urging the follow-up investigations with larger samples at different redshift

synchrotron emission arising from the interaction of an outflow with the
surrounding circumnuclear medium (CNM). We generalize the common equipartition
analysis to be applicable in cases lacking a clear spectral peak or even with
just an upper limit. We show that, for detected events, there is a lower limit
on the combination of the outflow's velocity $v$ and solid angle $\Omega$,
$\simeq v\Omega^{a}$ (with $a \simeq 0.5$) that constrains the outflow's
properties. Considering several possible outflow components accompanying TDEs,
we find that: Isotropic outflows such as disk winds with $v\sim10^4\,\rm
km\,s^{-1}$ and $\Omega = 4 \pi$ can easily produces the observed flares; The
bow shock of the unbound debris has a wedge-like geometry and it must be
geometrically thick with $\Omega\gtrsim1$ and a fraction of its mass ($\gtrsim
0.01 \,M_{\odot}$), has to move at $v \gtrsim 2 \times 10^4\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$;
Conical Newtonian outflows such as jets can also be a radio source but both
their velocity and the CNM density should be larger than those of isotropic
winds by a factor of $\sim(\Omega/4\pi)^{-0.5}$. Our limits on the CNM
densities are typically 30-100 times larger than those found by previous
analysis that ignored non-relativistic electrons that do not emit synchrotron
radiation. We show that unless $v$ and $\Omega$ are known radio observation
alone cannot determine the CNM density. We also find that late (a few years
after the TDE) radio upper-limits rule out energetic, $\sim 10^{51-52}\,\rm
erg$, relativistic jets like the one observed in TDE Sw J1644+57, implying that
such jets are rare.

that automatically separates the signals of astronomical emission lines from
the drift noise components in the fast-sampled (1--10 Hz) time-series spectra
obtained by a position-switching (PSW) observation. Because the proposed method
does not apply subtraction between two sets of noisy data (i.e., on-source and
off-source spectra), it improves the observation sensitivity by a factor of
$\sqrt{2}$. It also reduces artificial signals such as baseline ripples on a
spectrum, which may also help to improve the effective sensitivity. We
demonstrate this improvement by using the spectroscopic data of emission lines
toward a high-redshift galaxy observed with a 2-mm receiver on the 50-m Large
Millimeter Telescope (LMT). Since the proposed method is carried out offline
and no additional measurements are required, it offers an instant improvement
on the spectra reduced so far with the conventional method. It also enables
efficient deep spectroscopy driven by the future 50-m class large submillimeter
single-dish telescopes, where fast PSW observations by mechanical antenna or
mirror drive are difficult to achieve.

preheating already at very small couplings, in which case the dark matter
abundance becomes independent of the inflaton-dark matter coupling and is

period, but we do not assume periods must correspond with rotation in this
work. Two min TESS light curves of 284 cool stars are searched for periods from
1-10 d using two newly-developed periodograms. Because flares are discrete
events in noisy and incomplete data, typical periodograms are not well-suited
to detect phased flaring. We construct and test a new Bayesian likelihood
periodogram and a modified Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We find 6 candidates with
a false-alarm probability below 1%. Three targets are >3-sigma detections of
flare periodicity; the others are plausible candidates which cannot be

correlate with the stellar rotation period or its 1/2 alias. Periodicity from 2

their importance for understanding the details of the dynamics of planet
formation and evolution. While the dynamics of two-planet MMRs are well
understood and approximately described by a one degree of freedom Hamiltonian,
little is known of the exact dynamics of three-bodies resonances besides the
cases of zeroth-order MMRs or when one of the body is a test particle. In this
work, I propose the first general integrable model for first-order three-planet
mean motion resonances. I show that one can generalize the strategy proposed in
the two-planet case to obtain a one degree of freedom Hamiltonian. The dynamics
of these resonances are governed by the second fundamental model of resonance.
The model is valid for any mass ratio between the planets and for every
first-order resonance. I show the agreement of the analytical model with
numerical simulations. As examples of application I show how this model could
improve our understanding of the capture into MMRs as well as their role on the
stability of planetary systems.

white dwarf and a main sequence companion (i.e. WDMS binaries) within 100pc. We
select 112 objects based on their location within the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram, of which 97 are new identifications. We fit their spectral energy
distributions (SED) with a two-body fitting algorithm implemented in VOSA
(Virtual Observatory SED Analyser) to derive the effective temperatures,
luminosities and radii (hence surface gravities and masses) of both components.
The stellar parameters are compared to those from the currently largest
catalogue of close WDMS binaries, from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We
find important differences between the properties of the Gaia and SDSS samples.
In particular, the Gaia sample contains WDMS binaries with considerably cooler
white dwarfs and main sequence companions (some expected to be brown dwarfs).
The Gaia sample also shows an important population of systems consisting of
cool and extremely low-mass white dwarfs, not present in the SDSS sample.
Finally, using a Monte Carlo population synthesis code, we find that the
volume-limited sample of systems identified here seems to be highly complete
(~80+-9 per cent), however it only represents ~9 per cent of the total
underlying population. The missing ~91 per cent includes systems in which the
main sequence companions entirely dominate the SEDs. We also estimate an upper
limit to the total space density of close WDMS binaries of ~(3.7+-1.9)x10^{-4}
pc{-3}.

inference while suffering from stringent constraints in computing resources.
Split computing (SC) emerges as a popular approach to the issue by executing
only initial layers on devices and offloading the remaining to the cloud. Prior
works usually assume that SC offers privacy benefits as only intermediate
features, instead of private data, are shared from devices to the cloud. In
this work, we debunk this SC-induced privacy protection by (i) presenting a
novel data-free model inversion method and (ii) demonstrating sample inversion
where private data from devices can still be leaked with high fidelity from the
shared feature even after tens of neural network layers. We propose
Divide-and-Conquer Inversion (DCI) which partitions the given deep network into
multiple shallow blocks and inverts each block with an inversion method.
Additionally, cycle-consistency technique is introduced by re-directing the
inverted results back to the model under attack in order to better supervise
the training of the inversion modules. In contrast to prior art based on
generative priors and computation-intensive optimization in deriving inverted
samples, DCI removes the need for real device data and generative priors, and
completes inversion with a single quick forward pass over inversion modules.
For the first time, we scale data-free and sample-specific inversion to deep
architectures and large datasets for both discriminative and generative
networks. We perform model inversion attack to ResNet and RepVGG models on
ImageNet and SNGAN on CelebA and recover the original input from intermediate
features more than 40 layers deep into the network.

recently discovered that achiral but bent core mesogens can also form chiral
helices, the assembly of chiral microstructures from achiral polymers has
rarely been explored. Here, we reveal chiral emergence from achiral conjugated
polymers for the first time, in which hierarchical helical structures are
developed through a multistep assembly pathway. Upon increasing concentration
beyond a threshold volume fraction, pre-aggregated polymer nanofibers form
lyotropic liquid crystalline (LC) mesophases with complex, chiral morphologies.
Combining imaging, X-ray and spectroscopy techniques with molecular
simulations, we demonstrate that this structural evolution arises from
torsional polymer molecules which induce multiscale helical assembly,
progressing from nano- to micron scale helical structures as the solution
concentration increases. This study unveils a previously unknown complex state
of matter for conjugated polymers that can pave way to a new field of chiral
(opto)electronics. We anticipate that hierarchical chiral helical structures
can profoundly impact how conjugated polymers interact with light, transport
charges, and transduce signals from biomolecular interactions and even give

distribution (HOD) emulator method of arxiv:1907.06293 to model the redMaGiC
sample of colour-selected passive galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey (DES),
adding parameters that describe central galaxy incompleteness, galaxy assembly
bias, and a scale-independent multiplicative lensing bias $A_{lens}$. We use
this emulator to forecast cosmological constraints attainable from the GGL
surface density profile $\Delta\Sigma(r_p)$ and the projected galaxy
correlation function $w_{p,gg}(r_p)$ in the final (Year 6) DES data set over
scales $r_p=0.3-30h^{-1}$ Mpc. For a $3\%$ prior on $A_{lens}$ we forecast
precisions of $1.9\%$, $2.0\%$, and $1.9\%$ on $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $S_8
\equiv \sigma_8\Omega_m^{0.5}$, marginalized over all halo occupation
distribution (HOD) parameters as well as $A_{lens}$ and a point-mass
contribution to $\Delta\Sigma$. Adding scales $r_p=0.3-3h^{-1}$ Mpc improves
the $S_8$ precision by a factor of $\sim1.6$ relative to a large scale
($3.0-30.0h^{-1}$ Mpc) analysis, equivalent to increasing the survey area by a
factor of ${\sim}2.6$. Sharpening the $A_{lens}$ prior to $1\%$ further
improves the $S_8$ precision by a factor of $1.7$ (to $1.1\%$), and it
amplifies the gain from including non-linear scales. Our emulator achieves
percent-level accuracy similar to the projected DES statistical uncertainties,
demonstrating the feasibility of a fully non-linear analysis. Obtaining precise
parameter constraints from multiple galaxy types and from measurements that
span linear and non-linear clustering offers many opportunities for internal
cross-checks, which can diagnose systematics and demonstrate the robustness of

stars. Their intense radiation fields are believed to efficiently remove the
small dust grains that are constantly replenished by collisions. For lower-mass
stars, in particular M-stars, the dust removal mechanism needs to be further
investigated given the much weaker radiation field produced by these objects.
Aims. We present new polarimetric observations of the nearly edge-on disk
around the pre-main sequence M-type star GSC 07396-00759, taken with VLT/SPHERE
IRDIS, with the aim to better understand the morphology of the disk, its dust
properties, and the star-disk interaction via the stellar mass-loss rate.
Methods. We model our observations to characterize the location and properties
of the dust grains using the Henyey-Greenstein approximation of the polarized
phase function and evaluate the strength of the stellar winds. Results. We find
that the observations are best described by an extended and highly inclined
disk ($i\approx 84.3\,^{\circ}\pm0.3$) with a dust distribution centered at a
radius $r_{0}\approx107\pm2$ au. The polarized phase function $S_{12}$ is best
reproduced by an anisotropic scattering factor $g\approx0.6$ and small
micron-sized dust grains with sizes $s>0.3\,\mathrm{\mu}$m. We furthermore
discuss some of the caveats of the approach and a degeneracy between the grain
size and the porosity. Conclusions. Even though the radius of the disk may be
over-estimated, our results suggest that using a given scattering theory might
not be sufficient to fully explain key aspects such as the shape of the phase
function, or the dust grain size. With the caveats in mind, we find that the
average mass-loss rate of GSC 07396-00759 can be up to 500 times stronger than
that of the Sun, supporting the idea that stellar winds from low-mass stars can
evacuate small dust grains from the disk.

critical for transparency and accountability in decision processes, such as in

organ transplantations has progressed over the years, a pertinent question is:
How have actual organ allocation policies been evolving? To give an answer, we
desire a policy learning method that provides interpretable representations of
decision-making, in particular capturing an agent's non-stationary knowledge of
the world, as well as operating in an offline manner. First, we model the
evolving behavior of decision-makers in terms of contextual bandits, and
formalize the problem of Inverse Contextual Bandits (ICB). Second, we propose
two concrete algorithms as solutions, learning parametric and nonparametric
representations of an agent's behavior. Finally, using both real and simulated

classicality for these particular observables. We illustrate this mechanism by
developing a QSL formalism for continuous variable quantum systems undergoing
general Gaussian dynamics. For these systems, we show that three typical
scenarios leading to vanishing QSL times, namely large squeezing, small
effective Planck's constant, and large particle number, can be fundamentally
connected to each other. In contrast, by studying the dynamics of open quantum

incoherent mixing of states from the addition of classical noise typically
increases the QSL time.

resulting process model is supposed to describe all possible event sequences of
the underlying system. Generalization is a process model quality dimension of
interest. A generalization metric should quantify the extent to which a process
model represents the observed event sequences contained in the event log and
the unobserved event sequences of the system. Most of the available metrics in
the literature cannot properly quantify the generalization of a process model.
A recently published method [1] called Adversarial System Variant Approximation
leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to approximate the underlying event
sequence distribution of a system from an event log. While this method
demonstrated performance gains over existing methods in measuring the
generalization of process models, its experimental evaluations have been
performed under ideal conditions. This paper experimentally investigates the
performance of Adversarial System Variant Approximation under non-ideal
conditions such as biased and limited event logs. Moreover, experiments are
performed to investigate the originally proposed sampling hyperparameter value
of the method on its performance to measure the generalization. The results
confirm the need to raise awareness about the working conditions of the
Adversarial System Variant Approximation method. The outcomes of this paper
also serve to initiate future research directions.

are prohibitively expensive, quasi-Newton methods are often used in lieu of

approximate the true Hessian. Multipoint symmetric secant (MSS) methods can be
thought of as generalizations of quasi-Newton methods in that they attempt to
impose additional requirements on their approximation of the Hessian. Given an
initial Hessian approximation, MSS methods generate a sequence of
possibly-indefinite matrices using rank-2 updates to solve nonconvex
unconstrained optimization problems. For practical reasons, up to now, the
initialization has been a constant multiple of the identity matrix. In this
paper, we propose a new limited-memory MSS method for large-scale nonconvex

outperforms the standard initialization. Numerical results also suggest that
this approach is competitive with both a basic L-SR1 trust-region method and an

of spiral structure, some of which may arise from disk-planet interaction.
Using 3D hydrodynamics with $\beta$-cooling to a vertically-stratified
background, as well as radiative-transfer modeling, we investigate the
temperature rise in planet-driven spirals. In rapidly cooling disks, the
temperature rise is dominated by a contribution from stellar irradiation,
0.3-3% inside the planet radius but always <0.5% outside. When cooling time
equals or exceeds dynamical time, however, this is overwhelmed by hydrodynamic
PdV work, which introduces a 10-20% perturbation within a factor of 2 from the
planet's orbital radius. We devise an empirical fit of the spiral amplitude
$\Delta (T)$ to take into account both effects. Where cooling is slow, we find
also that temperature perturbations from buoyancy spirals -- a strictly 3D,
non-isothermal phenomenon -- become nearly as strong as those from Lindblad
spirals, which are amenable to 2D and isothermal studies. Our findings may help
explain observed thermal features in disks like TW Hydrae and CQ Tauri, and
underscore that 3D effects have a qualitatively important effect on disk
structure.

integrating knowledge graph reasoning, computer vision, and natural language

context-driven, sequential reasoning based on the scene entities and their
semantic and spatial relationships. As a first step, we derive a scene graph
that describes the objects in the image, as well as their attributes and their
mutual relationships. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning agent is trained
to autonomously navigate in a multi-hop manner over the extracted scene graph
to generate reasoning paths, which are the basis for deriving answers. We
conduct an experimental study on the challenging dataset GQA, based on both
manually curated and automatically generated scene graphs. Our results show
that we keep up with a human performance on manually curated scene graphs.
Moreover, we find that Graphhopper outperforms another state-of-the-art scene

propose a multi-variance replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin
diffusion method to tackle the challenge of the multiple local optima in the

local traps and accelerating the convergence. However, it may not be efficient
to solve mathematical inversion problems by using the vanilla replica method
directly since the method doubles the computational cost in evaluating the

the likelihood function evaluation. We give an unbiased estimate of the

To verify our idea, we design and solve four inverse problems which have
multiple modes. The proposed method is also employed to train the Bayesian PINN

the contribution of individual datum in machine learning. However, both SV and
LC suffer computational challenges due to the need for retraining models on
combinatorially many data subsets. In this work, we propose to boost the
efficiency in computing Shapley value or Least core by learning to estimate the
performance of a learning algorithm on unseen data combinations. Theoretically,
we derive bounds relating the error in the predicted learning performance to
the approximation error in SV and LC. Empirically, we show that the proposed
method can significantly improve the accuracy of SV and LC estimation.

graphs. Often the graph is modeled as a sample from the Stochastic Block Model,
in which each vertex belongs to a community. The probability that two vertices
are connected by an edge depends on the communities of those vertices. In this
paper, we consider a model of {\em censored} community detection with two
communities, where most of the data is missing as the status of only a small
fraction of the potential edges is revealed. In this model, vertices in the
same community are connected with probability $p$ while vertices in opposite
communities are connected with probability $q$. The connectivity status of a
given pair of vertices $\{u,v\}$ is revealed with probability $\alpha$,
independently across all pairs, where $\alpha = \frac{t \log(n)}{n}$. We
establish the information-theoretic threshold $t_c(p,q)$, such that no
algorithm succeeds in recovering the communities exactly when $t < t_c(p,q)$.
We show that when $t > t_c(p,q)$, a simple spectral algorithm based on a
weighted, signed adjacency matrix succeeds in recovering the communities
exactly.
  While spectral algorithms are shown to have near-optimal performance in the
symmetric case, we show that they may fail in the asymmetric case where the
connection probabilities inside the two communities are allowed to be
different. In particular, we show the existence of a parameter regime where a
simple two-phase algorithm succeeds but any algorithm based on the top two
eigenvectors of the weighted, signed adjacency matrix fails.

enriched in lead. Here, we show that EC22536-5304 is a binary star with a
metal-poor subdwarf F-type (sdF) companion. We have performed a detailed
analysis of high-resolution SALT/HRS and VLT/UVES spectra, deriving metal
abundances for the hot subdwarf, as well as atmospheric parameters for both
components. Because we consider the contribution of the sdF star, the derived
lead abundance for the sdOB, +6.3 +/- 0.3 dex relative to solar, is even higher
than previously thought. We derive Teff = 6210 +/- 70 K, log g = 4.64 +/- 0.10,
[Fe/H] = -1.95 +/- 0.04, and [$\alpha$/Fe] = +0.40 +/- 0.04 for the sdF
component. Radial velocity variations, although poorly sampled at present,
indicate that the binary system has a long orbital period of about 457 days.
This suggests that the system was likely formed through stable Roche lobe
overflow (RLOF). A kinematic analysis shows that EC22536-5304 is on an
eccentric orbit around the Galactic centre. This, as well as the low
metallicity and strong alpha-enhancement of the sdF-type companion, indicate
that EC22536-5304 is part of the Galactic halo or metal-weak thick disc. As the
first long-period hot subdwarf binary below about [Fe/H] = -1, EC22536-5304 may
help to constrain the RLOF mechanism for mass transfer from low-mass,
low-metallicity red giant branch (RGB) stars to main-sequence companions.

System bodies with a hydrologic cycle, may harbor liquid hydrocarbon-based
analogs of our terrestrial aquifers, referred to as ""alkanofers"". On the Earth,
petroleum and natural gas reservoirs show a vertical gradient in chemical
composition, established over geological timescales. In this work, we aim to
investigate the conditions under which Titan's processes could lead to similar
situations. We built numerical models including barodiffusion and
thermodiffusion (Soret's effect) in N_2+CH_4+C_2H_6 liquid mixtures, which are
relevant for Titan's possible alkanofers. Our main assumption is the existence
of reservoirs of liquids trapped in a porous matrix with low permeability. Due
to the small size of the molecule, nitrogen seems to be more sensitive to
gravity than ethane, even if the latter has a slightly larger mass. This
behavior, noticed for an isothermal crust, is reinforced by the presence of a
geothermal gradient. Vertical composition gradients, formed over timescales of
between a fraction of a mega-year to several tens of mega-years, are not
influenced by molecular diffusion coefficients. We find that ethane does not
accumulate at the bottom of the alkanofers under diffusion, leaving the
question of why ethane is not observed on Titan's surface unresolved. If the
alkanofer liquid was in contact with water-ice, we checked that N_2 did not, in
general, impede the clathration of C_2H_6, except in some layers.
Interestingly, we found that noble gases could easily accumulate at the bottom
of an alkanofer.

rise to the so-called Wrong-Way Risk (WWR). Even after a decade of the
financial crisis, addressing WWR in both sound and tractable ways remains
challenging. Academicians have proposed arbitrage-free set-ups through copula
methods but those are computationally expensive and hard to use in practice.
Resampling methods are proposed by the industry but they lack mathematical
foundations. The purpose of this article is to bridge this gap between the
approaches used by academicians and industry. To this end, we propose a
stochastic correlation approach to asses WWR. The methods based on constant
correlation to model the dependency between exposure and counterparty credit
risk assume a linear dependency, thus fail to capture the tail dependence.
Using a stochastic correlation we move further away from the Gaussian copula
and can capture the tail risk. This effect is reflected in the results where
the impact of stochastic correlation on calculated CVA is substantial when
compared to the case when a high constant correlation is assumed between
exposure and credit. Given the uncertainty inherent to CVA, the proposed method
is believed to provide a promising way to model WWR.

conventional single-photon detection techniques. However, detecting lower
energy single-photons (<0.8 eV) with high efficiency and low timing jitter has
remained a challenge. To achieve unity internal efficiency at mid-infrared

Inspired by this approach we develop an improved approach that is benchmarked
for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations. We show here that the
original approach reduces the method stability in non-equilibrium situations.
Here we propose a new procedure to replace the metastable and unstable regions
of these EOS by alternative functions. Our approach does not affects the
coexistence densities or the speed of sound of the liquid phase while
maintaining continuity of the sound speed in the pressure-density curve. Using
this approach we were able to reduce the relative error of the planar interface
vapor density compared to the thermodynamic consistent value by increasing the
vapor phase sound speed. To allow for the benchmarking of dynamic results we
also developed a finite difference method (FD) that solves the same macroscopic
conservation equation as the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method (LBM).
With this FD scheme we are able to perform mesh refinement and obtain reference
solutions for the dynamic tests. We observed excellent agreement between the FD
solutions and our proposed scheme. We also performed a detailed study of the
stability of the methods using simulations of a droplet impacting on a liquid

mounted on the windshield of the car, in addition to many images downloaded
from the internet to increase the size and variability of the database. Second,
various object detection algorithms are employed and compared to detect
potholes in real-time like SDD-TensorFlow, YOLOv3Darknet53 and YOLOv4Darknet53.
YOLOv4 achieved the best performance with 81% recall, 85% precision and 85.39%

The system was able to detect potholes from a range on 100 meters away from the

progressively cleave from one cell to multiple cells and finally transform to
morula and blastocyst. For time-lapse videos of embryos, most existing
developmental stage classification methods conduct per-frame predictions using
an image frame at each time step. However, classification using only images
suffers from overlapping between cells and imbalance between stages. Temporal
information can be valuable in addressing this problem by capturing movements
between neighboring frames. In this work, we propose a two-stream model for
developmental stage classification. Unlike previous methods, our two-stream
model accepts both temporal and image information. We develop a linear-chain
conditional random field (CRF) on top of neural network features extracted from
the temporal and image streams to make use of both modalities. The linear-chain
CRF formulation enables tractable training of global sequential models over
multiple frames while also making it possible to inject monotonic development
order constraints into the learning process explicitly. We demonstrate our
algorithm on two time-lapse embryo video datasets: i) mouse and ii) human
embryo datasets. Our method achieves 98.1 % and 80.6 % for mouse and human
embryo stage classification, respectively. Our approach will enable more
profound clinical and biological studies and suggests a new direction for
developmental stage classification by utilizing temporal information.

observations of DA white dwarfs, the most common spectral type of white dwarf
and the simplest atmosphere to model. We present a first derivation of the
semi-empirical IFMR for hydrogen deficient white dwarfs (non-DA) in open star
clusters. We identify a possible discrepancy between the DA and non-DA IFMRs,
with non-DA white dwarfs $\approx 0.07 M_\odot$ less massive at a given initial
mass. Such a discrepancy is unexpected based on theoretical models of non-DA
formation and observations of field white dwarf mass distributions. If real,
the discrepancy is likely due to enhanced mass loss during the final thermal
pulse and renewed post-AGB evolution of the star. However, we are dubious that
the mass discrepancy is physical and instead is due to the small sample size,
to systematic issues in model atmospheres of non-DAs, and to the uncertain
evolutionary history of Procyon B (spectral type DQZ). A significantly larger
sample size is needed to test these assertions. In addition, we also present
Monte Carlo models of the correlated errors for DA and non-DA white dwarfs in
the initial-final mass plane. We find the uncertainties in initial-final mass
determinations for individual white dwarfs can be significantly asymmetric, but
the recovered functional form of the IFMR is grossly unaffected by the
correlated errors.

complementary to other techniques and offers great promise in the era of 30
meter class telescopes. Space-based transit surveys have revolutionized our
understanding of the frequency of planets at small orbital radii around
Sun-like stars. The next generation of extremely large ground-based telescopes
will have the angular resolution and sensitivity to directly image planets with
$R < 4R_\oplus$ around the very nearest stars. Here, we predict yields from a
direct imaging survey of a volume-limited sample of Sun-like stars with the
Mid-Infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) instrument, planned for the 39
m European Southern Observatory (ESO) Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) that is
expected to be operational towards the end of the decade. Using Kepler
occurrence rates, a sample of stars with spectral types A-K within 6.5 pc, and
simulated contrast curves based on an advanced model of what is achievable from
coronagraphic imaging with adaptive optics, we estimated the expected yield
from METIS using Monte Carlo simulations. We find the METIS expected yield of
planets in the N2 band (10.10 - 12.40 $\mu$m) is 1.14 planets, which is greater
than comparable observations in the L (3.70 - 3.95 $\mu$m) and M (4.70 - 4.90
$\mu$m) bands. We also determined a 24.6% chance of detecting at least one
Jovian planet in the background limited regime assuming a 1 hour integration.
We calculated the yield per star and estimate optimal observing revisit times
to increase the yield. We also analyzed a northern hemisphere version of this
survey and found there are additional targets worth considering. In conclusion,
we present an observing strategy aimed to maximize the possible yield for
limited telescope time, resulting in 1.48 expected planets in the N2 band.

important factor in state-of-the-art exoplanet discovery surveys such as
CARMENES. Stellar rotation, along with heterogeneities in the photosphere and
chromosphere caused by activity, can result in false-positive planet
detections. Hence, it is necessary to determine the stellar rotation period and
compare it to any putative planetary RV signature. Long-term measurements of
activity indicators such as the chromospheric emission in the Ca II H&K lines
enable the identification of magnetic activity cycles. In order to determine
stellar rotation periods and study the long-term behavior of magnetic activity
of the CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO) sample, it is advantageous
to extract Ca II H&K time series from archival data, since the CARMENES
spectrograph does not cover the blue range of the stellar spectrum containing
the Ca II H&K lines. We have assembled a catalog of 11634 archival spectra of
186 M dwarfs acquired by seven different instruments covering the Ca II H&K
regime: ESPADONS, FEROS, HARPS, HIRES, NARVAL, TIGRE, and UVES. The relative
chromospheric flux in these lines was directly extracted from the spectra by
rectification with PHOENIX synthetic spectra via narrow passbands around the Ca
ii H&K line cores. The combination of archival spectra from various instruments
results in time series for 186 stars from the CARMENES GTO sample. As an
example of the use of the catalog, we report the tentative discovery of three
previously unknown activity cycles of M dwarfs. We conclude that the method of
extracting Ca II H&K fluxes with the use of model spectra yields consistent
results for different instruments and that the compilation of this catalog will
enable the analysis of long-term activity time series for a large number of M
dwarfs.

  arXiv:2101.10992",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most cyber-physical systems (CPS) encounter a large volume of data which is
added to the system gradually in real time and not altogether in advance. In
this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that yields optimal control
strategies for such CPS at the intersection of control theory and learning. In
the proposed framework, we use the actual CPS, i.e., the ""true"" system that we
seek to optimally control online, in parallel with a model of the CPS that is
available. We then institute an information state for the system which does not
depend on the control strategy. An important consequence of this independence
is that for any given choice of a control strategy and a realization of the
system's variables until time t, the information states at future times do not
depend on the choice of the control strategy at time t but only on the
realization of the decision at time t, and thus they are related to the concept
of separation between estimation of the state and control. Namely, the future
information states are separated from the choice of the current control
strategy. Such control strategies are called separated control strategies.
Hence, we can derive offline the optimal control strategy of the system with
respect to the information state, which might not be precisely known due to
model uncertainties or complexity of the system, and then use standard learning
approaches to learn the information state online while data are added gradually
to the system in real time. We show that after the information state becomes
known, the separated control strategy of the CPS model derived offline is
optimal for the actual system. We illustrate the proposed framework in a
dynamic system consisting of two subsystems with a delayed sharing information
structure.

motion of plasma. For the very first stage of the process, the governing dynamo
equation can be reduced to a system of first order ordinary differential
equations. For this case we suggest a regular method to calculate the growth
rate of magnetic energy. Based on this method we calculate the growth rate for
random flow with finite memory time and anisotropic statistical distribution of
the stretching matrix and compare the results with corresponding ones for
isotropic case and for short-correlated approximation. We find that for
moderate Strouhal numbers and moderate anisotropy the analytical results
reproduce the numerically estimated growth rates reasonably well, while for
larger governing parameters the quantitative difference becomes substantial. In
particular, analytical approximation is applicable for the Strouhal numbers

the analysis of confirmatory randomised trials, with the main statistical
justifications being that this increases power and, when a randomisation scheme
balanced covariates, permits a valid estimate of experimental error. There are
various methods available to account for covariates but it is not clear how to
choose among them. Methods: Taking the perspective of writing a statistical
analysis plan, we consider how to choose between the three most promising broad
approaches: direct adjustment, standardisation and
inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting. Results: The three approaches are
similar in being asymptotically efficient, in losing efficiency with
mis-specified covariate functions, and in handling designed balance. If a
marginal estimand is targeted (for example, a risk difference or survival
difference), then direct adjustment should be avoided because it involves
fitting non-standard models that are subject to convergence issues. Convergence
is most likely with IPTW. Robust standard errors used by IPTW are
anti-conservative at small sample sizes. All approaches can use similar methods
to handle missing covariate data. With missing outcome data, each method has
its own way to estimate a treatment effect in the all-randomised population. We
illustrate some issues in a reanalysis of GetTested, a randomised trial
designed to assess the effectiveness of an electonic
sexually-transmitted-infection testing and results service. Conclusions: No
single approach is always best: the choice will depend on the trial context. We
encourage trialists to consider all three methods more routinely.

(called ""Mad-lib"" as per the word substitution game). Using a dataset of 5572
SMS spam messages, we first established a baseline of detection performance
using widely known document representation models (BoW and TFIDF) and the novel
BERT model, coupled with a variety of classification algorithms (Decision Tree,
kNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron). Then, we
built a thesaurus of the vocabulary contained in these messages, and set up a
Mad-lib attack experiment in which we modified each message of a held out
subset of data (not used in the baseline experiment) with different rates of
substitution of original words with synonyms from the thesaurus. Lastly, we
evaluated the detection performance of the three representation models (BoW,
TFIDF and BERT) coupled with the best classifier from the baseline experiment
(SVM). We found that the classic models achieved a 94% Balanced Accuracy (BA)
in the original dataset, whereas the BERT model obtained 96%. On the other
hand, the Mad-lib attack experiment showed that BERT encodings manage to
maintain a similar BA performance of 96% with an average substitution rate of
1.82 words per message, and 95% with 3.34 words substituted per message. In
contrast, the BA performance of the BoW and TFIDF encoders dropped to chance.
These results hint at the potential advantage of BERT models to combat these
type of ingenious attacks, offsetting to some extent for the inappropriate use
of semantic relationships in language.

semantic information about obstacles when making decisions about how to

segmentation with a depth map to classify and localize objects in the scene.
The system avoids obstacles differentially, based on the identity of the

objects such as humans. The system can also navigate closer to harmless
obstacles and ignore obstacles that pose no collision danger, enabling it to
navigate more efficiently. We validate our approach in two simulated

  We share our experiences in mine idiomatic patterns from the Hack repo at

We propose a scalable, lightweight static analysis-based approach to construct
such a tree that is well suited to mine semantic idioms using nonparametric

  Our experiments with Jezero on Hack code shows a clear advantage of adding

result, our constraint enables more sample efficient learning by suppressing
redundant exploration and exploitation. Our experiments on MiniGrid, DeepMind

phase-space density environments have an excess of single-planet systems
compared to stars in low density fields. This correlation is puzzling as
stellar clustering is expected to influence mostly the outer part of planetary
systems. Here we examine the possibility that stellar flybys indirectly excite
the mutual inclinations of initially coplanar SEs, breaking their co-transiting
geometry. We propose that flybys excite the inclinations of exterior substellar
companions, which then propagate the perturbation to the inner SEs. Using
analytical calculations of the secular coupling between SEs and companions,
together with numerical simulations of stellar encounters, we estimate the
expected number of ""effective"" flybys per planetary system that lead to the
destruction of the SE co-transiting geometry. Our analytical results can be
rescaled easily for various SE and companion properties (masses and semi-major
axes) and stellar cluster parameters (density, velocity dispersion and
lifetime). We show that for a given SE system, there exists an optimal
companion architecture that leads to the maximum number of effective flybys;
this results from the trade-off between the flyby cross section and the
companion's impact on the inner system. Subject to uncertainties in the cluster
parameters, we conclude that this mechanism is inefficient if the SE system has
a single exterior companion, but may play an important role in ""SE + two
companions"" systems that were born in dense stellar clusters. Whether this
effect causes the observed correlation between planet multiplicity and stellar
overdensities remains to be confirmed.

transport processes in their atmospheres. Recent observations have shown that
the nightsides of hot Jupiters are a nearly constant 1100 K for a wide range of
equilibrium temperatures (T$_{eq}$), lower than those predicted by 3D global
circulation models. Here we investigate the impact of nightside clouds on the
observed nightside temperatures of hot Jupiters using an aerosol microphysics
model. We find that silicates dominate the cloud composition, forming an
optically thick cloud deck on the nightsides of all hot Jupiters with T$_{eq}$
$\leq$ 2100 K. The observed nightside temperature is thus controlled by the
optical depth profile of the silicate cloud with respect to the
temperature-pressure profile. As nightside temperatures increase with T$_{eq}$,
the silicate cloud is pushed upwards, forcing observations to probe cooler
altitudes. The cloud vertical extent remains fairly constant due to competing
impacts of increasing vertical mixing strength with T$_{eq}$ and higher rates
of sedimentation at higher altitudes. These effects, combined with the
intrinsically subtle increase of the nightside temperature with T$_{eq}$ due to
decreasing radiative timescale at higher instellation levels lead to low,
constant nightside photospheric temperatures consistent with observations. Our
results suggest a drastic reduction in the day-night temperature contrast when
nightside clouds dissipate, with the nightside emission spectra transitioning
from featureless to feature-rich. We also predict that cloud absorption
features in the nightside emission spectra of hot Jupiters should reach
$\geq$100 ppm, potentially observable with the James Webb Space Telescope.

between words, have become the backbone of machine learning, expanding beyond
natural language processing into other domains. This growth in adaptation comes
at the cost of prohibitively large memory requirements and computational
complexity, especially at higher number of input elements. This limitation is
due to inherently limited data reuse opportunities and quadratic growth in
memory footprints, leading to severe memory-boundedness and limited scalability
of input elements. This work addresses these challenges by devising a tailored
dataflow optimization, called FLAT, for attention mechanisms without altering
their functionality. This dataflow processes costly attention operations
through a unique fusion mechanism, transforming the memory footprint quadratic
growth to merely a linear one. To realize the full potential of this bespoke
mechanism, we propose a tiling approach to enhance the data reuse across
attention operations. Our method both mitigates the off-chip bandwidth
bottleneck as well as reduces the on-chip memory requirement. FLAT delivers
1.94x (1.76x) speedup and 49% and (42%) of energy savings compared to the
state-of-the-art Edge (Cloud) accelerators with no customized dataflow
optimization. When on-chip resources are scarce (20 KB-200 KB), FLAT yields, on
average, 1.5x end-to-end latency reduction across a diverse range of
conventional attention-based models with input sequence lengths ranging from
512-token to 64K-token. Our evaluations demonstrate that state-of-the-art DNN
dataflow applied to attention operations reach the efficiency limit for inputs
above 512 elements. In contrast, FLAT unblocks transformer models for inputs
with up to 64K elements

corresponding in this limit to the dynamics of the relative phase between the
two spin components, describes a translation of the fringes of the equilibrium
density profile, thereby providing the crystal Goldstone mode typical of a
supersolid configuration. Finally, using sum-rule arguments, we show that the
superfluid density can be experimentally accessed by measuring the ratio of the
sound velocities parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the spin-orbit

parameters (effects) as (1) exchangeable across datasets and (2) correlated to

statistical performance when the number of covariates exceeds the number of

traits (defining datasets) for thousands of individuals (responses) on up to
millions of genetic variants (covariates). When an analyst has more covariates

as (1) exchangeable across covariates and (2) correlated to differing degrees

alternative perspective. We devise an empirical Bayes estimator for learning
the degree of correlation between datasets. We develop theory that demonstrates

modes in shock-containing jets. While many of the discontinuities in tonal
frequency exhibited by screeching jets can be associated with a change in the
azimuthal mode, there has to date been no explanation for the existence of
multiple axisymmetric modes at different frequencies. This paper provides just
such an explanation. As shown in previous works, specific wavenumbers arise
from the interaction of waves in the flow with the shocks. This provides new
paths for driving upstream-travelling waves that can potentially close the
resonance loop. Predictions using locally parallel and spatially periodic
linear stability analyses and the wavenumber spectrum of the shock-cell
structure suggest that the A1 mode resonance is closed by a wave generated when
the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode interacts with the leading wavenumber of the
shock-cell structure. The A2 mode is closed by a wave that arises due to
interaction between the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and a secondary wavenumber peak,
which arises from the spatial variation of the shock-cell wavelength. The
predictions are shown to closely match experimental data, and possible
justifications for the dominance of each mode are provided based on the growth
rates of the absolute instability.

from poor sample complexity, which greatly reduces their applicability to

that using just a polynomial number of samples, one can learn a centralized

policy within the learned model instead of the true system, without requiring
additional environment interactions. We also learn a centralized exploration
policy within our model that learns to collect additional data in state-action

it improves sample efficiency by up to 20x. Finally, to investigate the

a conceptually straightforward yet fundamentally novel and highly robust
approach to multivariate density deconvolution by stochastically rotating the
replicates toward the corresponding true latent values. We also address the
additionally significantly challenging problem of accommodating conditionally

a Bayesian route to estimation and inference, implemented via an efficient
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, appropriately accommodating uncertainty in
all aspects of our analysis. Asymptotic convergence guarantees for the method

[Purpose] Our purpose is to deduce neutron skin thicknesses of $^{208}$Pb and

double folding model with the $g$-matrix. [Methods] We fold the $g$-matrix and
densities given by mean field calculations. In order to remedy
less-constrainedness of the neutron sector, we renormalize densities so as to
reproduce the observed cross sections. [Results] We found that a 3.4~$\%$
renormalization is necessary for $^{208}$Pb. The neutron density obtained from
renormalization results in $R_{\rm skin}=$ 0.416$\pm$0.146 fm by confronting
the precision proton radius. [Conclusions] Our result is consistent with PREX

large human effort. Recent works approached this task with innovative
weakly-supervised algorithms such as multi-instance learning (MIL) and class
activation maps (CAM), however, these methods often yield inaccurate or
incomplete regions. One of the reasons is the neglection of the pathological
implications hidden in the relationship across anatomical regions within each
image and the relationship across images. In this paper, we argue that the
cross-region and cross-image relationship, as contextual and compensating
information, is vital to obtain more consistent and integral regions. To model
the relationship, we propose the Graph Regularized Embedding Network (GREN),
which leverages the intra-image and inter-image information to locate diseases
on chest X-ray images. GREN uses a pre-trained U-Net to segment the lung lobes,
and then models the intra-image relationship between the lung lobes using an
intra-image graph to compare different regions. Meanwhile, the relationship
between in-batch images is modeled by an inter-image graph to compare multiple
images. This process mimics the training and decision-making process of a
radiologist: comparing multiple regions and images for diagnosis. In order for
the deep embedding layers of the neural network to retain structural
information (important in the localization task), we use the Hash coding and
Hamming distance to compute the graphs, which are used as regularizers to
facilitate training. By means of this, our approach achieves the
state-of-the-art result on NIH chest X-ray dataset for weakly-supervised
disease localization. Our codes are accessible online

be solved. Although more and more approaches are proposed one after another,
most of existing methods inevitably lost details due to continuous downsampling

design a batch-loss to assign large loss factors to the harder samples in a

LGN will greatly expand our primarily Apollo-based knowledge of the deep lunar

are also analyzed to provide increased opportunities for seismic observations.
Geodetic constraints require the network to have at least three nearside
stations at maximum limb distances. Heat flow and electromagnetic measurements
should be obtained away from terrane boundaries and from magnetic anomalies at

sometimes decreases with increasing temperature. Though mechanistic
understanding has been gained for some individual materials, a general answer
to the question ""Why does volume sometimes decrease with the increase of
temperature?"" remains lacking. Based on the thermodynamic relation that the
derivative of volume with respect to temperature, i.e., thermal expansion, is
equal to the negative derivative of entropy with respect to pressure, we
developed a general theory in terms of multiscale entropy to understand and
predict the change of volume as a function of temperature, which is termed as
zentropy theory in the present work. It is shown that a phase at high
temperatures is a statistical representation of the ground-state stable and
multiple nonground-state metastable configurations. It is demonstrated that
when the volumes of the major nonground-state configurations are smaller than
that of the ground-state configuration, the volume of the phase may decrease
with the increase of temperature in certain ranges of temperature-pressure
combinations, depicting the negative divergency of thermal expansion at the
critical point. As examples, positive and negative divergencies of thermal
expansion are predicted at the critical points of Ce and Fe3Pt, respectively,
along with the temperature and pressure ranges for abnormally positive and
negative thermal expansion. The authors believe that the zentropy theory is

auxiliary network that works as an add-on to an already trained main

with a binary cross-entropy loss. To obtain additionally useful information
from the adversarial examples, the architecture design is closely related to
information maximization principles where two layers of the main classification

optimization procedure of purification, the auxiliary network is trained with
AVmixup. AID-purifier can be used together with other purifiers such as
PixelDefend for an extra enhancement. The overall results indicate that the

(A2G) links face unpredictable Doppler effect arising from the inevitable
wobbling of RW UAV. Moreover, the time-varying channel characteristics during
transmission lead to inaccurate channel estimation, which in turn results in
the deteriorated bit error probability performance of the UAV A2G link. This
paper studies the impact of mechanical wobbling on the Doppler effect of the
millimeter-wave wireless channel between a hovering RW UAV and a ground node.
Our contributions of this paper lie in: i) modeling the wobbling process of a
hovering RW UAV; ii) developing an analytical model to derive the channel
temporal autocorrelation function (ACF) for the millimeter-wave RW UAV A2G link
in a closed-form expression; and iii) investigating how RW UAV wobbling impacts
the Doppler effect on the millimeter-wave RW UAV A2G link. Numerical results
show that different RW UAV wobbling patterns impact the amplitude and the
frequency of ACF oscillation in the millimeter-wave RW UAV A2G link. For UAV
wobbling, the channel temporal ACF decreases quickly and the impact of the
Doppler effect is significant on the millimeter-wave A2G link.

  Mixture Model and Concatenated Residual Modules","Submitted to IEEE Transactions On Image Processing",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently deep learning-based image compression methods have achieved
significant achievements and gradually outperformed traditional approaches
including the latest standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) in both PSNR and
MS-SSIM metrics. Two key components of learned image compression frameworks are
the entropy model of the latent representations and the encoding/decoding
network architectures. Various models have been proposed, such as
autoregressive, softmax, logistic mixture, Gaussian mixture, and Laplacian.
Existing schemes only use one of these models. However, due to the vast
diversity of images, it is not optimal to use one model for all images, even
different regions of one image. In this paper, we propose a more flexible
discretized Gaussian-Laplacian-Logistic mixture model (GLLMM) for the latent
representations, which can adapt to different contents in different images and
different regions of one image more accurately. Besides, in the
encoding/decoding network design part, we propose a concatenated residual
blocks (CRB), where multiple residual blocks are serially connected with
additional shortcut connections. The CRB can improve the learning ability of
the network, which can further improve the compression performance.
Experimental results using the Kodak and Tecnick datasets show that the
proposed scheme outperforms all the state-of-the-art learning-based methods and
existing compression standards including VVC intra coding (4:4:4 and 4:2:0) in

sample ground state solutions. To this end, we run five fair sampling problems
(each with at least three ground state solutions) that are based both on
quantum annealing and on the Grover Mixer-QAOA algorithm for gate-based NISQ
hardware. In particular, we use seven IBM~Q devices, the Aspen-9 Rigetti

with scientists across all fields making large jumps from their prior research
streams. However, this adaptive response reveals a pervasive ""pivot penalty"",
where the impact of the new research steeply declines the further the
scientists move from their prior work. The pivot penalty is severe amidst
COVID-19 research, but it is not unique to COVID-19. Rather it applies nearly
universally across the sciences, and has been growing in magnitude over the
past five decades. While further features condition pivoting, including a
scientist's career stage, prior expertise and impact, collaborative scale, the
use of new coauthors, and funding, we find that the pivot penalty persists and
remains substantial regardless of these features, suggesting the pivot penalty
acts as a fundamental friction that governs science's ability to adapt. The
pivot penalty not only holds key implications for the design of the scientific

long-standing questions in astronomy. In particular, the lifetime of spiral

this work, we aim to inspect these issues using a large catalogue of open
clusters. We compiled a catalogue of 3794 open clusters based on Gaia EDR3. A
majority of these clusters have accurately determined parallaxes, proper
motions, and radial velocities. The age parameters for these open clusters are
collected from references or calculated in this work. In order to understand
the nearby spiral structure and its evolution, we analysed the distributions,
kinematic properties, vertical distributions, and regressed properties of
subsamples of open clusters. We find evidence that the nearby spiral arms are
compatible with a long-lived spiral pattern and might have remained
approximately stable for the past 80 million years. In particular, the Local
Arm, where our Sun is currently located, is also suggested to be long-lived in
nature and probably a major arm segment of the Milky Way. The evolutionary
characteristics of nearby spiral arms show that the dynamic spiral mechanism
might be not prevalent for our Galaxy. Instead, density wave theory is more
consistent with the observational properties of open clusters.

and graphical models. Nevertheless, very few solutions have been proposed for
the task of functional classification of CAD models. Hence, for this research,
CAD models have been collected from Engineering Shape Benchmark (ESB), National
Design Repository (NDR) and augmented with newer models created using a
modelling software to form a dataset - 'CADNET'. It is proposed to use a
residual network architecture for CADNET, inspired by the popular ResNet. A
weighted Light Field Descriptor (LFD) scheme is chosen as the method of feature
extraction, and the generated images are fed as inputs to the CNN. The problem
of class imbalance in the dataset is addressed using a class weights approach.
Experiments have been conducted with other signatures such as geodesic distance

The LFD-based CNN approach using the proposed network architecture, along with
gradient boosting yielded the best classification accuracy on CADNET.

of simultaneously maintaining both robustness against unmodeled uncertainties

dealing with uncertainties, a motion planner must update its trajectory,
adapting to the newly revealed environment in real-time; failing to do so may
involve unsafe circumstances. Many existing planning algorithms guarantee these
by maintaining the clearance needed to perform an emergency brake, which is
itself a robust and persistently feasible maneuver. However, such maneuvers are
not applicable for systems in which braking is impossible or risky, such as
fixed-wing aircraft. To that end, we propose a real-time robust planner that
recursively guarantees persistent feasibility without any need of braking. The
planner ensures robustness against bounded uncertainties and persistent
feasibility by constructing a loop of sequentially composed funnels, starting
from the receding horizon local trajectory's forward reachable set. We
implement the proposed algorithm for a robotic car tracking a speed-fixed
reference trajectory. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm
can be run at faster than 16 Hz, while successfully keeping the system away
from entering any dead-end, to maintain safety and feasibility.

geometric construction that has been extensively studied over three decades as
it possesses the two most basic properties of a good spanner: constant maximum
degree and constant lightness. Recently, Eppstein and Khodabandeh showed that
the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^2$ admits a sublinear separator in a strong
sense: any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has
a separator of size $O(\sqrt{k})$. Their technique is inherently planar and is
not extensible to higher dimensions. They left showing the existence of a small
separator for the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any constant $d\geq 3$
as an open problem. In this paper, we resolve the problem of Eppstein and
Khodabandeh by showing that any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has a separator of size $O(k^{1-1/d})$. We introduce a new
technique that gives a simple characterization for any geometric graph to have
a sublinear separator that we dub $\tau$-lanky: a geometric graph is
$\tau$-lanky if any ball of radius $r$ cuts at most $\tau$ edges of length at
least $r$ in the graph. We show that any $\tau$-lanky geometric graph of $n$
vertices in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has a separator of size $O(\tau n^{1-1/d})$. We then
derive our main result by showing that the greedy spanner is $O(1)$-lanky. We
indeed obtain a more general result that applies to unit ball graphs and point
sets of low fractal dimensions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our technique naturally
extends to doubling metrics. We use the $\tau$-lanky characterization to show
that there exists a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner for doubling metrics of dimension
$d$ with a constant maximum degree and a separator of size
$O(n^{1-\frac{1}{d}})$; this result resolves an open problem posed by Abam and
Har-Peled a decade ago.

is designed to aggregate and propagate attentive statistics from one layer to
the next in a serialized manner. In addition, we employ an input-aware query
for each utterance with the statistics pooling. With more layers stacked, the

fitting models to a ""mini-broad"" (mini-BAL) and six NAL profiles in four
spectra of the quasar UM675 taken over a rest-frame interval of 4.24 years. Our
fitting results are consistent with past results for the mini-BAL system in
this quasar by Hamann et al. (1997b). We also measure covering factors ($C_{\rm
f}$) for two narrow components in the CIV and NV mini-BALs and their overlap
covering factor with the broad component. We find that $C_{\rm f}$(NV) is
always larger than $C_{\rm f}$(CIV) for the broad component, while the opposite
is true for the narrow components in the mini-BAL system. This could be
explained if the broad and narrow components originated in gas at different
radial distances, but it seems more likely to be due to them produced by gas at
the same distance but with different gas densities (i.e., ionization states).
The variability detected only in the broad absorption component in the mini-BAL
system is probably due to gas motion since both $C_{\rm f}$(CIV) and $C_{\rm
f}$(NV) vary. We determine for the first time that multiple absorbing clouds
(i.e., a broad and two narrow components) overlap along our line of sight. We
conclude that the new method improves fitting results considerably compared to
previous methods.

rigidly rotating liquid column in this communication. Although literature
pertaining to this problem dates back to 1959, the relation between inviscid
and viscous stability criteria has not yet been clarified. While the viscous
criterion for stability, given by $We = n^2+k^2-1$, is both necessary and
sufficient, this relation has only been shown to be sufficient in the inviscid
case. Here, $We = \rho \Omega^2 a^3/\gamma$ is the Weber number and measures
the relative magnitudes of the centrifugal and surface tension forces, with
$\Omega$ being the angular velocity of the rigidly rotating column, $a$ the
column radius, $\rho$ the density of the fluid, and $\gamma$ the surface
tension coefficient; $k$ and $n$ denote the axial and azimuthal wavenumbers of
the imposed perturbation. We show that the subtle difference between the
inviscid and viscous criteria arises from the surprisingly complicated picture
of inviscid stability in the $We-k$ plane. For all $n >1$, the viscously
unstable region, corresponding to $We > n^2+k^2-1$, contains an infinite
hierarchy of inviscidly stable islands ending in cusps, with a dominant leading
island. Only the dominant island, now infinite in extent along the $We$ axis,
persists for $n= 1$. This picture may be understood, based on the underlying
eigenspectrum, as arising from the cascade of coalescences between a retrograde
mode, that is the continuation of the cograde surface-tension-driven mode
across the zero Doppler frequency point, and successive retrograde Coriolis
modes constituting an infinite hierarchy.

challenging task. In this work, we describe a framework that leverages a
proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to efficiently sample the
high-dimensional space of spherical inverse problems with a sparsity-promoting
wavelet prior. We detail the modifications needed for the algorithm to be
applied to spherical problems, and give special consideration to the crucial
forward modelling step which contains spherical harmonic transforms that are
computationally expensive. By sampling the posterior, our framework allows for
full and flexible uncertainty quantification, something which is not possible
with other methods based on, for example, convex optimisation. We demonstrate
our framework in practice on full-sky cosmological mass-mapping and on a common
problem in global seismic tomography. We find that our approach is potentially
useful at moderate resolutions, such as those of interest in seismology. Our
framework is generally limited by resolution requirements, such as those
required for astrophysical applications, due to the poor scaling of the
complexity of spherical harmonic transforms with resolution. A new Python
package, pxmcmc, containing the proximal MCMC sampler, measurement operators,
wavelet transforms and sparse priors is made publicly available.

independent solutions to enhance the robustness of CNNs against adversarial

recently, adversarial training techniques have been widely studied and improved
while the pixel denoising-based method is getting less attractive. However, it
is still questionable whether there exists a more advanced pixel
denoising-based method and whether the combination of the two solutions
benefits each other. To this end, we first comprehensively investigate two
kinds of pixel denoising methods for adversarial robustness enhancement (i.e.,
existing additive-based and unexplored filtering-based methods) under the loss
functions of image-level and semantic-level, respectively, showing that
pixel-wise filtering can obtain much higher image quality (e.g., higher PSNR)
as well as higher robustness (e.g., higher accuracy on adversarial examples)
than existing pixel-wise additive-based method. However, we also observe that
the robustness results of the filtering-based method rely on the perturbation
amplitude of adversarial examples used for training. To address this problem,
we propose predictive perturbation-aware & pixel-wise filtering}, where
dual-perturbation filtering and an uncertainty-aware fusion module are designed
and employed to automatically perceive the perturbation amplitude during the
training and testing process. The method is termed as AdvFilter. Moreover, we
combine adversarial pixel denoising methods with three adversarial
training-based methods, hinting that considering data and models jointly is
able to achieve more robust CNNs. The experiments conduct on NeurIPS-2017DEV,

appropriate tool for studying them is agent-based modeling, in which nodes,

yielding various macroscopic behavioral patterns. Here we focus on studying a
generalization of the weighted social network model, being one of the most
fundamental agent-based models for describing the formation of social ties and
social networks. This Generalized Weighted Social Network (GWSN) model
incorporates triadic closure, homophilic interactions, and various link
termination mechanisms, which have been studied separately in the previous
works. Accordingly, the GWSN model has an increased number of input parameters
and the model behavior gets excessively complex, making it challenging to
clarify the model behavior. We have executed massive simulations with a
supercomputer and using the results as the training data for deep neural
networks to conduct regression analysis for predicting the properties of the
generated networks from the input parameters. The obtained regression model was
also used for global sensitivity analysis to identify which parameters are
influential or insignificant. We believe that this methodology is applicable
for a large class of complex network models, thus opening the way for more

problems in nonlinear PDEs. In this paper, we present some new numerical
evidence that the incompressible axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with
smooth initial data of finite energy seem to develop potentially singular
behavior at the origin. This potentially singular behavior is induced by a
potential finite time singularity of the 3D Euler equations that we reported in
the companion paper (arXiv:2107.05870). We present numerical evidence that the
3D Navier--Stokes equations develop nearly self-similar singular scaling
properties with maximum vorticity increased by a factor of 10^7. We have
applied several blow-up criteria to study the potentially singular behavior of
the Navier--Stokes equations. The Beale-Kato-Majda blow-up criterion and the
blow-up criteria based on the growth of enstrophy and negative pressure seem to
imply that the Navier--Stokes equations using our initial data develop a
potential finite time singularity. We have also examined the
Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin regularity criteria. Our numerical results for the
cases of (p,q) = (4,8), (6,4), (9,3) and (p,q)=(\infty,2) provide strong
evidence for the potentially singular behavior of the Navier--Stokes equations.
Our numerical study shows that while the global L^3 norm of the velocity grows
very slowly, the localized version of the L^3 norm of the velocity experiences
rapid dynamic growth relative to the localized L^3 norm of the initial
velocity. This provides further evidence for the potentially singular behavior
of the NavieStokes equations.

such FMR frequency fluctuations of a YIG sphere down to mK-temperatures, and
find them independent of temperature and drive power. This suggests that the

recognition with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To mitigate this issue,
we propose the GraphJigsaw that constructs jigsaw puzzles at various stages in
the classification network and solves the puzzles with the graph convolutional
network (GCN) in a progressive manner. Solving the puzzles requires the model
to spot the shape patterns of the cartoon faces as the texture information is
quite limited. The key idea of GraphJigsaw is constructing a jigsaw puzzle by
randomly shuffling the intermediate convolutional feature maps in the spatial
dimension and exploiting the GCN to reason and recover the correct layout of
the jigsaw fragments in a self-supervised manner. The proposed GraphJigsaw
avoids training the classification model with the deconstructed images that
would introduce noisy patterns and are harmful for the final classification.
Specially, GraphJigsaw can be incorporated at various stages in a top-down
manner within the classification model, which facilitates propagating the
learned shape patterns gradually. GraphJigsaw does not rely on any extra manual
annotation during the training process and incorporates no extra computation
burden at inference time. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental
results have verified the feasibility of our proposed GraphJigsaw, which
consistently outperforms other face recognition or jigsaw-based methods on two

constraints: (a) deterministic constraints on the domain of the optimization
variable, which are difficult to project onto; and (b) deterministic or
stochastic constraints that admit efficient projection. Problems of this form
arise frequently in the context of semidefinite programming as well as when
various NP-hard problems are solved approximately via semidefinite relaxation.
Since projection onto the first set of constraints is difficult, it becomes
necessary to explore projection-free algorithms, such as the stochastic
Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. On the other hand, the second set of constraints
cannot be handled in the same way, and must be incorporated as an indicator
function within the objective function, thereby complicating the application of
FW methods. Similar problems have been studied before; however, they suffer
from slow convergence rates. This work, equipped with momentum based gradient
tracking technique, guarantees fast convergence rates on par with the
best-known rates for problems without the second set of constraints.
Zeroth-order variants of the proposed algorithms are also developed and again
improve upon the state-of-the-art rate results. We further propose the novel
trimmed FW variants that enjoy the same convergence rates as their classical
counterparts, but are empirically shown to require significantly fewer calls to
the linear minimization oracle speeding up the overall algorithm. The efficacy

  Super-Resolution",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Image super-resolution (SR) methods can generate remote sensing images with
high spatial resolution without increasing the cost, thereby providing a
feasible way to acquire high-resolution remote sensing images, which are
difficult to obtain due to the high cost of acquisition equipment and complex
weather. Clearly, image super-resolution is a severe ill-posed problem.
Fortunately, with the development of deep learning, the powerful fitting
ability of deep neural networks has solved this problem to some extent. In this
paper, we propose a network based on the generative adversarial network (GAN)
to generate high resolution remote sensing images, named the multi-attention
generative adversarial network (MA-GAN). We first designed a GAN-based
framework for the image SR task. The core to accomplishing the SR task is the
image generator with post-upsampling that we designed. The main body of the
generator contains two blocks; one is the pyramidal convolution in the
residual-dense block (PCRDB), and the other is the attention-based upsample
(AUP) block. The attentioned pyramidal convolution (AttPConv) in the PCRDB
block is a module that combines multi-scale convolution and channel attention
to automatically learn and adjust the scaling of the residuals for better
results. The AUP block is a module that combines pixel attention (PA) to
perform arbitrary multiples of upsampling. These two blocks work together to
help generate better quality images. For the loss function, we design a loss
function based on pixel loss and introduce both adversarial loss and feature
loss to guide the generator learning. We have compared our method with several
state-of-the-art methods on a remote sensing scene image dataset, and the
experimental results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
MA-GAN.

  Relay Networks","28 pages",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the information freshness of two-way relay networks
(TWRN) operated with physical-layer network coding (PNC). Information freshness
is quantified by age of information (AoI), defined as the time elapsed since
the generation time of the latest received information update. PNC reduces
communication latency of TWRNs by turning superimposed electromagnetic waves
into network-coded messages so that end users can send update packets to each
other via the relay more frequently. Although sending update packets more
frequently is potential to reduce AoI, how to deal with packet corruption has
not been well investigated. Specifically, if old packets are corrupted in any
hop of a TWRN, one needs to decide the old packets to be dropped or to be
retransmitted, e.g., new packets have recent information, but may require more
time to be delivered. We study the average AoI with and without ARQ in
PNC-enabled TWRNs. We first consider a non-ARQ scheme where old packets are
always dropped when corrupted, referred to once-lost-then-drop (OLTD), and a
classical ARQ scheme with no packet lost, referred to as reliable packet
transmission (RPT). Interestingly, our analysis shows that neither the non-ARQ
scheme nor the pure ARQ scheme achieves good average AoI. We then put forth an
uplink-lost-then-drop (ULTD) protocol that combines packet drop and ARQ.
Experiments on software-defined radio indicate that ULTD significantly
outperforms OLTD and RPT in terms of average AoI. Although this paper focuses
on TWRNs, we believe the insight of ULTD applies generally to other two-hop
networks. Our insight is that to achieve high information freshness, when
packets are corrupted in the first hop, new packets should be generated and
sent (i.e., old packets are discarded); when packets are corrupted in the
second hop, old packets should be retransmitted until successful reception.

are usually fragmented, whether from a single image or multiple images. Despite
their significant improvements, most existing methods still focus on the most
discriminative parts from a single image, ignoring informative details in other
regions and lacking consideration of clues from other associated images. In
this paper, we analyze the difficulties of fine-grained image recognition from
a new perspective and propose a transformer architecture with the peak
suppression module and knowledge guidance module, which respects the
diversification of discriminative features in a single image and the
aggregation of discriminative clues among multiple images. Specifically, the
peak suppression module first utilizes a linear projection to convert the input
image into sequential tokens. It then blocks the token based on the attention
response generated by the transformer encoder. This module penalizes the
attention to the most discriminative parts in the feature learning process,
therefore, enhancing the information exploitation of the neglected regions. The
knowledge guidance module compares the image-based representation generated
from the peak suppression module with the learnable knowledge embedding set to
obtain the knowledge response coefficients. Afterwards, it formalizes the
knowledge learning as a classification problem using response coefficients as
the classification scores. Knowledge embeddings and image-based representations
are updated during training so that the knowledge embedding includes
discriminative clues for different images. Finally, we incorporate the acquired
knowledge embeddings into the image-based representations as comprehensive
representations, leading to significantly higher performance. Extensive
evaluations on the six popular datasets demonstrate the advantage of the
proposed method.

group-shared latent heterogeneity. Without carefully capturing such latent
heterogeneity, the lifetime modeling accuracy will be significantly undermined.
In this work, we propose a generic Bayesian lifetime modeling approach by
comprehensively investigating the structures of group-shared latent
heterogeneity caused by different types of group-shared unobserved covariates.
The proposed approach is flexible to characterize multi-type group-shared
latent heterogeneity in lifetime data. Besides, it can handle the case of lack
of group membership information and address the issue of limited sample size.
Bayesian sampling algorithm with data augmentation technique is further
developed to jointly quantify the influence of observed covariates and
group-shared latent heterogeneity. Further, we conduct comprehensive numerical
study to demonstrate the improved performance of proposed modeling approach via
comparison with alternative models. We also present empirical study results to
investigate the impacts of group number and sample size per group on estimating
the group-shared latent heterogeneity and to demonstrate model identifiability

covariates. We also present a real case study to illustrate the effectiveness

scalability, accuracy, and cross-language portability. This paper presents FAPR
-- our novel approach that suggests repairs based on program differences in a
fast and accurate manner. FAPR is different from current tools in three
aspects. First, it encodes syntactic information into token sequences to enable
high-speed comparison between incorrect and correct programs. Second, to
accurately extract program differences, FAPR adopts a novel matching algorithm
that maximizes token-level matches and minimizes statement-level differences.
Third, FAPR relies on testing instead of static/dynamic analysis to validate
and refine candidate repairs, so it eliminates the language dependency or high
runtime overhead incurred by complex program analysis. We implemented FAPR to
suggest repairs for both C and C++ programs; our experience shows the great
cross-language portability of FAPR. More importantly, we empirically compared
FAPR with a state-of-the-art tool Clara. FAPR suggested repairs for over 95.5%
of incorrect solutions. We sampled 250 repairs among FAPR's suggestions, and
found 89.6% of the samples to be minimal and correct. FAPR outperformed Clara
by suggesting repairs for more cases, creating smaller repairs, producing
higher-quality fixes, and causing lower runtime overheads. Our results imply
that FAPR can potentially help instructors or TAs to effectively locate bugs in
incorrect code, and to provide debugging hints/guidelines based on those

energy conservations, physically consistent transport process, and similar
domain of dependence and influence between the physical reality and the
numerical representation. Therefore, a physically soundable numerical scheme
must be a compact one which involves the closest neighboring cells within the
domain of dependence for the solution update under a CFL number $(\sim 1 )$. In
the construction of explicit high-order compact scheme, subcell flow
distributions or the equivalent degree of freedoms beyond the cell averaged
flow variables must be evolved and updated, such as the gradients of the flow
variables inside each control volume. The direct modeling of flow evolution
under generalized initial condition will be developed in this paper. The direct
modeling will provide the updates of flow variables differently on both sides
of a cell interface and limit high-order time derivatives of the flux function
nonlinearly in case of discontinuity in time, such as a shock wave moving
across a cell interface within a time step. The direct modeling unifies the
nonlinear limiters in both space for the data reconstruction and time for the
time-dependent flux transport. Under the direct modeling framework, as an
example, the high-order compact gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) will be constructed.
The scheme shows significant improvement in terms of robustness, accuracy, and
efficiency in comparison with the previous high-order compact GKS.

light-harvesting and light-emitting applications as their variable chemical
composition allows the optoelectronic properties to be tailored to specific
applications. Halide mixing is one of the most powerful techniques to tune the
optical bandgap of metal-halide perovskites across wide spectral ranges.
However, halide mixing has commonly been observed to result in phase
segregation, which reduces excited-state transport and limits device
performance. While the current emphasis lies on the development of strategies
to prevent phase segregation, it remains unclear how halide mixing may affect
excited-state transport even if phase purity is maintained. In this work, we
study excitonic excited-state transport in phase pure mixed-halide 2D
perovskites. Using transient photoluminescence microscopy, we show that,
despite phase purity, halide mixing inhibits exciton transport in these
materials. We find a significant reduction even for relatively low alloying
concentrations, with bromide-rich perovskites being particularly sensitive to
the introduction of iodide ions. Performing Brownian dynamics simulations, we
are able to reproduce our experimental results and attribute the decrease in
diffusivity to the energetically disordered potential landscape that arises due
to the intrinsic random distribution of alloying sites. Our results suggest
that even in the absence of phase segregation, halide mixing may still impact
carrier transport due to the local intrinsic inhomogeneities in the energy
landscape.

fundamental science and advanced technology. While time-reversal symmetry plays
the key role in most such materials, the bulk crystalline symmetries such as
mirror symmetry preserve the topological properties of topological crystalline
insulators (TCIs). It is apparent that any structural change may alter the
topological properties of TCIs. To investigate this relatively unexplored
landscape, we study the temperature evolution of the Dirac fermion states in an
archetypical mirror-symmetry protected TCI, SnTe employing high-resolution
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory
studies. Experimental results reveal a perplexing scenario; the bulk bands
observed at 22 K move nearer to the Fermi level at 60 K and again shift back to
higher binding energies at 120 K. The slope of the surface Dirac bands at 22 K
becomes smaller at 60 K and changes back to a larger value at 120 K. Our
results from the first-principles calculations suggest that these anomalies can
be attributed to the evolution of the hybridization physics with complex
structural changes induced by temperature. In addition, we discover drastically
reduced intensity of the Dirac states at the Fermi level at high temperatures
may be due to complex evolution of anharmonicity, strain, etc. These results
address robustness of the topologically protected surface states due to thermal

supervised learning only allows the prediction of disease classes that were

data, which is not a trivial task, especially for less frequently-occurring
diseases. As a result, it becomes inconceivable to build a model that can
diagnose all possible disease classes. Here, we propose a multi-label
generalized zero shot learning (CXR-ML-GZSL) network that can simultaneously
predict multiple seen and unseen diseases in CXR images. Given an input image,
CXR-ML-GZSL learns a visual representation guided by the input's corresponding
semantics extracted from a rich medical text corpus. Towards this ambitious
goal, we propose to map both visual and semantic modalities to a latent feature
space using a novel learning objective. The objective ensures that (i) the most
relevant labels for the query image are ranked higher than irrelevant labels,
(ii) the network learns a visual representation that is aligned with its
semantics in the latent feature space, and (iii) the mapped semantics preserve
their original inter-class representation. The network is end-to-end trainable
and requires no independent pre-training for the offline feature extractor.

this problem, we propose a probabilistic model for human motion prediction in
this paper. The key idea of our approach is to extend the conventional
deterministic motion prediction neural network to a Bayesian one. On one hand,
our model could generate several future motions when given an observed motion
sequence. On the other hand, by calculating the Epistemic Uncertainty and the
Heteroscedastic Aleatoric Uncertainty, our model could tell the robot if the
observation has been seen before and also give the optimal result among all
possible predictions. We extensively validate our approach on a large scale
benchmark dataset Human3.6m. The experiments show that our approach performs
better than deterministic methods. We further evaluate our approach in a
Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) scenario. The experimental results show that our
approach makes the interaction more efficient and safer.

alternatives is a prerequisite for moral responsibility. Determinism that
pervades classical physics, however, forbids free will, undermines the
foundations of ethics, and precludes meaningful quantification of personal
biases. To resolve that impasse, we utilize the characteristic indeterminism of
quantum physics and derive a quantitative measure for the amount of free will
manifested by the brain cortical network. The interaction between the central
nervous system and the surrounding environment is shown to perform a quantum
measurement upon the neural constituents, which actualize a single measurement
outcome selected from the resulting quantum probability distribution. Inherent
biases in the quantum propensities for alternative physical outcomes provide
varying amounts of free will, which can be quantified with the expected
information gain from learning the actual course of action chosen by the
nervous system. For example, neuronal electric spikes evoke deterministic
synaptic vesicle release in the synapses of sensory or somatomotor pathways,
with no free will manifested. In cortical synapses, however, vesicle release is
triggered indeterministically with probability of 0.35 per spike. This grants
the brain cortex, with its over 100 trillion synapses, an amount of free will
exceeding 96 terabytes per second. Although reliable deterministic transmission
of sensory or somatomotor information ensures robust adaptation of animals to
their physical environment, unpredictability of behavioral responses initiated
by decisions made by the brain cortex is evolutionary advantageous for avoiding

(LSTM) have been utilized as a tool for modeling and predicting long term
dynamics of complex stochastic molecular systems. Recently successful examples
on learning slow dynamics by LSTM are given with simulation data of low
dimensional reaction coordinate. However, in this report we show that the
following three key factors significantly affect the performance of language
model learning, namely dimensionality of reaction coordinates, temporal
resolution and state partition. When applying recurrent neural networks to
molecular dynamics simulation trajectories of high dimensionality, we find that
rare events corresponding to the slow dynamics might be obscured by other
faster dynamics of the system, and cannot be efficiently learned. Under such
conditions, we find that coarse graining the conformational space into
metastable states and removing recrossing events when estimating transition
probabilities between states could greatly help improve the accuracy of slow
dynamics learning in molecular dynamics. Moreover, we also explore other models
like Transformer, which do not show superior performance than LSTM in
overcoming these issues. Therefore, to learn rare events of slow molecular
dynamics by LSTM and Transformer, it is critical to choose proper temporal
resolution (i.e., saving intervals of MD simulation trajectories) and state
partition in high resolution data, since deep neural network models might not
automatically disentangle slow dynamics from fast dynamics when both are
present in data influencing each other.

Existing techniques perform anonymization using simple, syntactic measures to

To avoid this and incorporate the semantics of activities during anonymization,

algorithms for these tasks were based on a decomposition of $H$ into a
collection of odd cycles and stars, denoted $\mathcal{D}^*(H)=\{O_{k_1},
\ldots, O_{k_q}, S_{p_1}, \ldots, S_{p_\ell}\}$. These algorithms were shown to

  We present a new algorithm for sampling and approximately counting arbitrary

ingredient leading to this improvement is an improved uniform algorithm for
sampling stars, which might be of independent interest, as it allows to sample
vertices according to the $p$-th moment of the degree distribution.
  Finally, we prove that this algorithm is \emph{decomposition-optimal} for
decompositions that contain at least one odd cycle. These are the first lower
bounds for motifs $H$ with a nontrivial decomposition, i.e., motifs that have

the clumpy nature of the absorbers. Here we present the analysis of a new Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory campaign of the type-1 quasar PG 1114+445, which was
observed to investigate the time evolution of the multiphase outflowing
absorbers previously detected in its spectra. The analyzed dataset consists of
22 observations, with a total exposure of $\sim90$ ks, spanning about $20$

respect to all previous X-ray observations of this quasar. From the analysis of
the stacked spectra we find a fully covering absorber with a column density
$\log(N_\text{H}/\text{cm}^{-2})=22.9^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$. This is an order of
magnitude higher than the column density measured in the previous observations.
This is either due to a variation of the known absorbers, or by a new one,
eclipsing the X-ray emitting source. We also find a ionization parameter of

challenging as contributions are present both from coupling of the electronic

excited states intersect in the Condon region, significant non-adiabatic
contributions to absorption lineshapes can also be observed. Here, we introduce
a robust approach to model linear absorption spectra accounting for both
environmental and non-adiabatic effects from first principles. This model
parameterizes a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) Hamiltonian directly from energy
gap fluctuations calculated along molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of the
chromophore in solution, accounting for both anharmonicity in the potential and
direct solute-solvent interactions. The resulting system dynamics described by
the LVC Hamiltonian are solved exactly using the thermalized time-evolving
density operator with orthogonal polynomials algorithm (T-TEDOPA). The approach
is applied to the linear absorption spectrum of methylene blue (MB) in water.
We show that the strong shoulder in the experimental spectrum is caused by
vibrationally driven population transfer between the bright S1 and the dark S2
state. The treatment of the solvent environment is one of many factors which
strongly influences the population transfer and lineshape; accurate modeling
can only be achieved through the use of explicit quantum mechanical solvation.
The efficiency of T-TEDOPA, combined with LVC Hamiltonian parameterizations
from MD, leads to an attractive method for describing a large variety of

agent with preferences governed by Epstein-Zin stochastic differential utility
who invests in a constant-parameter Black-Scholes-Merton market.
  The paper has three main goals: first, to provide a detailed introduction to
infinite-horizon Epstein-Zin stochastic differential utility, including a
discussion of which parameter combinations lead to a well-formulated problem;
second, to prove existence and uniqueness of infinite horizon Epstein-Zin
stochastic differential utility under a restriction on the parameters governing
the agent's risk aversion and temporal variance aversion; and third, to provide
a verification argument for the candidate optimal solution to the
investment-consumption problem among all admissible consumption streams.
  To achieve these goals, we introduce a slightly different formulation of
Epstein-Zin stochastic differential utility to that which is traditionally used
in the literature. This formulation highlights the necessity and
appropriateness of certain restrictions on the parameters governing the
stochastic differential utility function.

diffuse dust taking into account stochastic heating of dust grains. This allows
us to obtain realistic high-resolution broadband images and fluxes from
ultraviolet to sub-millimeter wavelengths. For the diffuse dust component, we
consider two mechanisms for assigning dust to gas cells in the simulation. In
one case, only the densest or the coldest gas cells are allowed to have dust,
while in the other case this condition is relaxed to allow a larger number of
dust-containing cells. The latter approach yields galaxies with a larger radial
dust extent and an enhanced dust presence in the inter-spiral regions. At a
global scale, we compare Auriga galaxies with observations by deriving dust
scaling relations using SED fitting. At a resolved scale, we make a
multi-wavelength morphological comparison with nine well-resolved spiral
galaxies from the DustPedia observational database. We find that for both dust
assignment methods, although the Auriga galaxies show a good overall agreement
with observational dust properties, they exhibit a slightly higher specific
dust mass. The multi-wavelength morphological analysis reveals a good agreement
between the Auriga and the observed galaxies in the optical wavelengths. In the
mid and far-infrared wavelengths, Auriga galaxies appear smaller and more
centrally concentrated in comparison to their observed counterparts. We
publicly release the multi-observer images and fluxes in 50 commonly used

Prior understanding on the driving mechanism of the CDW and superconductivity
emphasizes the role of either bismuth (negative $U$ model) or oxygen ions
(ligand hole model). While holes in BKBO presumably reside on oxygen owing to
their negative charge transfer energy, so far there has been no other
comparative material studied. Here, we introduce (Ba,K)SbO$_{3}$ (BKSO) in
which the Sb 5$s$ orbital energy is higher than that of the Bi 6$s$ orbitals
enabling tuning of the charge transfer energy from negative to slightly
positive. The parent compound BaSbO$_{3-\delta}$ shows a larger CDW gap
compared to the undoped bismuthate BaBiO$_{3}$. As the CDW order is suppressed
via potassium substitution up to 65 %, superconductivity emerges, rising up to
$T_\mathrm{c}$ = 15 K. This value is lower than the maximum $T_\mathrm{c}$ of
BKBO, but higher by more than a factor of two at comparable potassium
concentrations. The discovery of an enhanced CDW gap and superconductivity in
BKSO indicates that the sign of the charge transfer energy may not be crucial,
but instead strong metal-oxygen covalency plays the essential role in
constituting a CDW and high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity in the main-group

removes this bias for events with signals in two or more read-out channels and
thereby improves the position resolution. The method also provides an estimate
of the position-response function for every event. Examples are given for which
its width as a function of the reconstructed position varies by as much as an
order of magnitude.

silicon pixel detector traversed by charged particles under different angles,

energy-loss fluctuations, the position-dependent electric field, the diffusion
of the charge carriers, the electronics noise and charge thresholds for
clustering. A comparison to test-beam-data is used to validate the simulation.

in various valleys of AlxGa1-xAs is estimated against continues photo carrier

Amalgamating the experimental results with analytical expressions, the X-valley

based on Density Functional Theory within the framework of the projector

Further, temperature dependence of {\tau}_S^X is studied over 10-80 K range,
which is explained by considering the intra-valley scattering of carriers in
the X-valley of indirect band gap AlGaAs barrier layer. It is learnt that the
strain induced modification of band structure lifts the degeneracy in X-valley,
which dominates the electron spin relaxation beyond 50 K. Furthermore, the DCP
spectra of hot electrons in indirect band gap AlGaAs layers is found to be
significantly different compared to that of direct bandgap AlGaAs. It is
understood as a consequence of linear k dependent Dresselhaus spin splitting

to which it represents gradient descent is an open question in the theory of
deep learning. The current paper studies this question. Viewing gradient
descent as an approximate numerical solution to the initial value problem of
gradient flow, we find that the degree of approximation depends on the
curvature around the gradient flow trajectory. We then show that over deep
neural networks with homogeneous activations, gradient flow trajectories enjoy
favorable curvature, suggesting they are well approximated by gradient descent.
This finding allows us to translate an analysis of gradient flow over deep
linear neural networks into a guarantee that gradient descent efficiently
converges to global minimum almost surely under random initialization.
Experiments suggest that over simple deep neural networks, gradient descent
with conventional step size is indeed close to gradient flow. We hypothesize

$C^0$ interior penalty and discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods are

that if 70% of the population followed tight stay-at-home restrictions, then at

system is represented by a network, where nodes correspond to firms, and

of cycles in the network indicates that a payment of a firm to one of its
lenders might result to some incoming payment. So, if a firm cannot fully repay
its debt, then the exact (partial) payments it makes to each of its creditors
can affect the cash inflow back to itself. We naturally assume that the firms
are interested in their financial well-being (utility) which is aligned with
the amount of incoming payments they receive from the network. This defines a
game among the firms, that can be seen as utility-maximizing agents who can
strategize over their payments.
  We are the first to study financial network games that arise under a natural
set of payment strategies called priority-proportional payments. We investigate
the existence and (in)efficiency of equilibrium strategies, under different
assumptions on how the firms' utility is defined, on the types of debt
contracts allowed between the firms, and on the presence of other financial
features that commonly arise in practice. Surprisingly, even if all firms'
strategies are fixed, the existence of a unique payment profile is not
guaranteed. So, we also investigate the existence and computation of valid
payment profiles for fixed payment strategies.

method is optimal for worst case distortion. While in practice many other
methods and heuristics are used, not much is known in terms of bounds on their
performance. The question of whether the JL method is optimal for practical
measures of distortion was recently raised in BFN19 (NeurIPS'19). They provided
upper bounds on its quality for a wide range of practical measures and showed
that indeed these are best possible in many cases. Yet, some of the most
important cases, including the fundamental case of average distortion were left
open. In particular, they show that the JL transform has $1+\epsilon$ average
distortion for embedding into $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, where
$k=O(1/\epsilon^2)$, and for more general $q$-norms of distortion, $k =
O(\max\{1/\epsilon^2,q/\epsilon\})$, whereas tight lower bounds were
established only for large values of $q$ via reduction to the worst case.
  In this paper we prove that these bounds are best possible for any
dimensionality reduction method, for any $1 \leq q \leq O(\frac{\log
(2\epsilon^2 n)}{\epsilon})$ and $\epsilon \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $n$
is the size of the subset of Euclidean space.
  Our results imply that the JL method is optimal for various distortion
measures commonly used in practice such as stress, energy and relative error.
We prove that if any of these measures is bounded by $\epsilon$ then
$k=\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ for any $\epsilon \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, matching
the upper bounds of BFN19 and extending their tightness results for the full
range moment analysis.
  Our results may indicate that the JL dimensionality reduction method should
be considered more often in practical applications, and the bounds we provide
for its quality should be served as a measure for comparison when evaluating
the performance of other methods and heuristics.

multiderivative RungeKutta (MDRK) techniques achieve higher-order of
consistency not only through the excessive addition of higher temporal
derivatives, but also through the addition of Runge-Kutta-type stages. This
adds more flexibility to the time integration in such a way that more stable
and more efficient schemes could be identified. The novel method permits the
practical application of MDRK schemes. In their original form, they are
difficult to utilize as higher-order flux derivatives have to be computed

evolution algorithms for a tensor network known as the infinite projected
entangled pair state (iPEPS). They differ by an error measure that is either,
respectively, local or takes into account full infinite tensor environment. In
this paper we test an intermediate neighborhood tensor update (NTU) accounting
for the nearest neighbor environment. This small environment can be contracted
exactly in a parallelizable way. It provides an error measure that is Hermitian
and non-negative down to machine precision. In the 2D quantum Ising model NTU
is shown to yield stable unitary time evolution following a sudden quench. It
also yields accurate thermal states despite correlation lengths that reach up
to 20 lattice sites. The latter simulations were performed with a manifestly
Hermitian purification of a thermal state. Both were performed with reduced
tensors that do not include physical (and ancilla) indices. This modification
naturally leads to two other schemes: a local SVD update (SVDU) and a full
tensor update (FTU) being a variant of FU.

the fundamental frequency $f_0$ of periodic signal components. Most established
schemes apply rather unspecific signal models such as sinusoidal models to the
estimation problem, which may limit time resolution and estimation accuracy.
This study proposes a novel time-domain locked-loop algorithm with low
computational effort and low memory footprint for $f_0$ estimation. The loop
control signal is directly derived from the input time signal, using a harmonic
signal model. Theoretically, this allows for a noise-robust and rapid $f_0$
estimation for periodic signals of arbitrary waveform, and without the
requirement of a prior frequency analysis. Several simulations with short
signals employing different types of periodicity and with added wide-band noise
were performed to demonstrate and evaluate the basic properties of the proposed
algorithm. Depending on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the estimator was
found to converge within 3-4 signal repetitions, even at SNR close to or below
0dB. Furthermore, it was found to follow fundamental frequency sweeps with a
delay of less than one period and to track all tones of a three-tone musical
chord signal simultaneously. Quasi-periodic sounds with shifted harmonics as
well as signals with stochastic periodicity were robustly tracked. Mean and
standard deviation of the estimation error, i.e., the difference between true
and estimated $f_0$, were at or below 1 Hz in most cases. The results suggest
that the proposed algorithm may be applicable to low-delay speech and music
analysis and processing.

quasi-processes can be characterized in terms of their occupation measures. In
the case where a particular decorability condition is satisfied, there is an
isomorphism between the cone of branching quasi-processes and the cone of
excessive measures, where the respective excessive measures are the occupation
measures of the branching quasi-processes. Taking a branching quasi-process as
intensity measure for a Poison point process we obtain random interlacements
that incorporate branching. In the particular case, where individuals produce
offspring with mean less than or equal to one, we provide an explicit
construction based on classical interlacements. We make strong use of the

us to control for the length scale of interactions. We ran numerical
simulations to monitor the evolution of MVM dynamics in real and synthetic

and one with mixed binary opinions. The transition depends on the scale of the
clans and on the strength of their influence. We found that enhancing group
diversity promotes consensus while strong kinship yields to metastable clusters
of same opinion. The segregated domains, which signal opinion polarization, are
discernible as spatial patterns in the hyperbolic embeddings of the networks.
Our multiscale framework can be easily applied to other dynamical processes

Still, existing techniques tend to underperform when presented with realistic

realistic defective training examples. In fact, real world bugs are scarce
which has driven existing methods to train on artificially created and mostly
unrealistic mutants. In this work, we propose a novel contextual mutation
operator which incorporates knowledge about the mutation context to dynamically
inject natural and more realistic faults into code. Our approach employs a
masked language model to produce a context-dependent distribution over feasible

does not only produce mutants which more accurately represent real bugs but
also lead to better performing bug detectors, both on artificial benchmarks and

of widespread interest in many disciplines. We present a unifying framework for
blending mechanistic and machine-learning approaches to identify dynamical
systems from noisily and partially observed data. We compare pure data-driven
learning with hybrid models which incorporate imperfect domain knowledge. Our
formulation is agnostic to the chosen machine learning model, is presented in
both continuous- and discrete-time settings, and is compatible both with model
errors that exhibit substantial memory and errors that are memoryless.
  First, we study memoryless linear (w.r.t. parametric-dependence) model error
from a learning theory perspective, defining excess risk and generalization
error. For ergodic continuous-time systems, we prove that both excess risk and
generalization error are bounded above by terms that diminish with the
square-root of T, the time-interval over which training data is specified.
  Secondly, we study scenarios that benefit from modeling with memory, proving
universal approximation theorems for two classes of continuous-time recurrent
neural networks (RNNs): both can learn memory-dependent model error. In
addition, we connect one class of RNNs to reservoir computing, thereby relating
learning of memory-dependent error to recent work on supervised learning
between Banach spaces using random features.
  Numerical results are presented (Lorenz '63, Lorenz '96 Multiscale systems)
to compare purely data-driven and hybrid approaches, finding hybrid methods
less data-hungry and more parametrically efficient. Finally, we demonstrate
numerically how data assimilation can be leveraged to learn hidden dynamics
from noisy, partially-observed data, and illustrate challenges in representing
memory by this approach, and in the training of such models.

by using power-law, stretched exponential, and $q$-Gaussian functions. We focus
on the fitted function parameters and how they change over the years by
comparing our results with those from earlier studies and find that, on the
time horizons of up to a few minutes, the so-called ""inverse-cubic power-law""
still constitutes an appropriate global reference. However, we no longer
observe the hypothesized universal constant acceleration of the market time
flow that was manifested before in an ever faster convergence of empirical
return distributions towards the normal distribution. Our results do not
exclude such a scenario but, rather, suggest that some other short-term
processes related to a current market situation alter market dynamics and may
mask this scenario. Real market dynamics is associated with a continuous
alternation of different regimes with different statistical properties. An
example is the COVID-19 pandemic outburst, which had an enormous yet short-time
impact on financial markets. We also point out that two factors -- speed of the
market time flow and the asset cross-correlation magnitude -- while related
(the larger the speed, the larger the cross-correlations on a given time
scale), act in opposite directions with regard to the return distribution
tails, which can affect the expected distribution convergence to the normal
distribution.

scattering amplitudes as the zero frequency limit of one or more external
states is approached. When the participating particles are treated in the
massless limit, the soft theorems are known to depend only on the directions of
the states on null infinity. Leveraging this fact, we develop dual
two-dimensional descriptions of soft theorems, recasting them as Ward
identities of such dual models on the celestial sphere. This is done by first
postulating putative holographic representations of the hard scattering
amplitudes and dressing the asymptotic operators with appropriate
two-dimensional analogues of the Wilson line. The soft theorems are then
recovered by inserting currents that generate the Ward identities of the dual
models. In addition to providing naturally holographic representations of the
soft theorems, we see that it becomes possible to develop presentations of the
asymptotic symmetries associated to these theorems entirely in terms of the
dual two-dimensional fields. In the course of carrying out this analysis for
soft theorems at leading order and beyond, we find that the two-dimensional
dual description of soft theorems may be directly inferred by drawing analogies
with the existing framework of asymptotic symmetry charges. We find that the
soft charges generating the asymptotic symmetries can be brought into
correspondence with dual two-dimensional currents, while the two-dimensional
Wilson loops can be related to the hard parts of the conserved charges.
Consequently, we rewrite the triality of asymptotic symmetries, soft theorems
and conserved charges directly in the language of a class of two-dimensional
theories.

Drag-Based Ensemble Model (DBEM) that takes into account the variability of

calculate the distribution and significance of the DBM results. Thus the DBEM
is able to calculate the most likely CME arrival times and speeds, quantify the
prediction uncertainties and determine the confidence intervals. A new DBEMv3
version is described in detail and evaluated for the first time determing the
DBEMv3 performance and errors by using various CME-ICME lists as well as it is
compared with previous DBEM versions. The analysis to find the optimal drag
parameter $\gamma$ and ambient solar wind speed $w$ showed that somewhat higher
values ($\gamma \approx 0.3 \times 10^{-7}$ km$^{-1}$, $w \approx$ 425
km\,s$^{-1}$) for both of these DBEM input parameters should be used for the
evaluation compared to the previously employed ones. Based on the evaluation
performed for 146 CME-ICME pairs, the DBEMv3 performance with mean error (ME)
of -11.3 h, mean absolute error (MAE) of 17.3 h was obtained. There is a clear
bias towards the negative prediction errors where the fast CMEs are predicted
to arrive too early, probably due to the model physical limitations and input

learning (RL) finds well-performing policies. However, it can lead to
undesirable or catastrophic outcomes when learning online in safety-critical

real-world agents that can learn during deployment. One way of ensuring that
agents respect hard limitations is to explicitly configure boundaries in which
they can operate. While this might work in some cases, we do not always have
clear a-priori information which states and actions can lead dangerously close
to hazardous states. Here, we present an approach where an additional policy
can override the main policy and offer a safer alternative action. In our
instinct-regulated RL (IR^2L) approach, an ""instinctual"" network is trained to
recognize undesirable situations, while guarding the learning policy against
entering them. The instinct network is pre-trained on a single task where it is
safe to make mistakes, and transferred to environments in which learning a new
task safely is critical. We demonstrate IR^2L in the OpenAI Safety gym domain,
in which it receives a significantly lower number of safety violations during
training than a baseline RL approach while reaching similar task performance.

in the ballistic regime, but inefficient in the diffusive/hydrodynamic regime.
In this paper, a general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS) is proposed to
expedite the convergence to steady-state solutions. First, macroscopic
synthetic equations are designed to guide the evolution of equilibrium
distribution functions for normal and resistive scatterings, so that fast
convergence can be achieved even in the diffusive/hydrodynamic regime. Second,
the Fourier stability analysis is conducted to find the convergence rate for
both CIS and GSIS, which rigorously proves the efficiency of GSIS over CIS.
Finally, several numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the
accuracy and efficiency of GSIS, where up to three orders of magnitude of
convergence acceleration is achieved.

It is also a probe of chromospheric and magnetospheric acceleration mechanisms.
Close stellar binaries, such as RS Canum Venaticorum (RS CVn) systems, are
particularly interesting as their heightened level of chromospheric activity
and possible direct magnetic interaction make them a unique laboratory to study
coronal and magnetospheric acceleration mechanisms. RS CVn binaries are known
to be radio-bright but coherent radio emission has only conclusively been
detected previously in one system. Here, we present a population of 14 coherent
radio emitting RS CVn systems. We identified the population in the ongoing
LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey as circularly polarised sources at 144MHz that are
astrometrically associated with known RS CVn binaries. We show that the
observed emission is powered by the electron cyclotron maser instability. We
use numerical calculations of the maser's beaming geometry to argue that the
commonly invoked 'loss-cone' maser cannot generate the necessary brightness
temperature in some of our detections and that a more efficient instability,
such as the shell or horseshoe maser, must be invoked. Such maser
configurations are known to operate in planetary magnetospheres. We also
outline two acceleration mechanisms that could produce coherent radio emission,
one where the acceleration occurs in the chromosphere and one where the
acceleration is due to an electrodynamic interaction between the stars. We
propose radio and optical monitoring observations that can differentiate
between these two mechanisms.

introduces a differential critic that learns from pairwise preferences, which

is built by defining an additional ranking loss over the Wasserstein GAN's

valuable unlabeled data points from a large pool. Traditional AL frameworks
have two limitations: First, they perform data selection in a multi-round
manner, which is time-consuming and impractical. Second, they usually assume
that there are a small amount of labeled data points available in the same
domain as the data in the unlabeled pool. Recent work proposes a solution for
one-round active learning based on data utility learning and optimization,
which fixes the first issue but still requires the initially labeled data
points in the same domain. In this paper, we propose $\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ as a
solution that solves both issues. Specifically, $\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ leverages the
idea of domain adaptation (DA) to train a data utility model which can
effectively predict the utility for any given unlabeled data in the target
domain once labeled. The trained data utility model can then be used to select
high-utility data and at the same time, provide an estimate for the utility of
the selected data. Our algorithm does not rely on any feedback from annotators
in the target domain and hence, can be used to perform zero-round active
learning or warm-start existing multi-round active learning strategies. Our
experiments show that $\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art AL strategies equipped with domain adaptation over various
domain shift settings (e.g., real-to-real data and synthetic-to-real data).
Particularly, $\mathrm{D^2ULO}$ is applicable to the scenario where source and
target labels have mismatches, which is not supported by the existing works.

reported for the first time based on an $e^+e^-$ annihilation sample of ten
billion $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector at $\sqrt{s}=3.097$
GeV. The branching fraction is determined to be ${\mathcal B}(\Lambda \to
p\mu^- \bar{\nu}_{\mu}) = [1.48\pm0.21(\rm stat) \pm 0.08(\rm syst)]\times
10^{-4}$, which is a significant improvement in precision over the previous
indirect measurements. Combining this result with the world average of
${\mathcal B}(\Lambda \to p e^- \bar{\nu}_{e})$, we obtain the ratio,
$\frac{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p \mu^- \bar{\nu}_{\mu})}{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p e^-
\bar{\nu}_{e})}$, to be $0.178 \pm 0.028$, which agrees with the standard model
prediction assuming lepton flavor universality. The asymmetry of the branching
fractions of $\Lambda \to p \mu^- \bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\Lambda} \to
\bar{p} \mu^+ \nu_{\mu}$ is also determined, and no evidence for $CP$ violation
is found.

  Reduction Indicators among Socially Vulnerable Populations during COVID-19","25 pages, 7 figures in the main text, 3 figures in supplemental
  information",,,,"physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Non-pharmacologic interventions (NPIs) are one method to mitigate the spread
and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. NPIs promote
protective actions to reduce exposure risk and can reduce mobility patterns
within communities. Growing research literature suggests that socially
vulnerable populations are disproportionately impacted with higher infection
and higher fatality rates of COVID-19, though there is limited understanding of
the underlying mechanisms to this health disparity. Thus, the research examines
two distinct and complimentary datasets at a granular scale for five urban
locations. Through statistical and spatial analyses, the research extensively
investigates the exposure risk reduction of socially vulnerable populations due
to NPIs. The mobility dataset tracks population movement across ZIP codes; it
is used for an origin-destination network analysis. The population activity
dataset is based on the number of visits from census block groups (CBG) to
points of interest (POIs), such as grocery stores, restaurants, education
centers, and medical facilities; it is used for network analysis of
population-facilities interactions. The mobility dataset showed that, after the
implementation of NPIs, socially vulnerable populations engaged in increased
mobility in the form of inflow between ZIP code areas. Similarly, population
activity analysis showed an increased exposure risk for socially vulnerable
populations based on a greater number of inflow visits of CBGs to POIs, which
increases the risk of contact at POIs, and a greater number of outflow visits
from POIs to home CBGs, which increases risk of transmission within CBGs. These
findings can assist emergency planners and public health officials in
comprehending how different groups are able to implement protective actions and
can inform more equitable and data-driven NPI policies for future epidemics.

edit distance function $\operatorname{ed}_{\mathcal H}(p)$ is (asymptotically)
the maximum proportion of ""edits"" (edge-additions plus edge-deletions)
necessary to transform any graph of density $p$ into a member of $\mathcal H$.
For any fixed $p\in[0,1]$, $\operatorname{ed}_{\mathcal H}(p)$ can be computed
from an object known as a colored regularity graph (CRG). This paper is
concerned with those points $p\in[0,1]$ for which infinitely many CRGs are
required to compute $\operatorname{ed}_{\mathcal H}$ on any open interval
containing $p$; such a $p$ is called an accumulation point. We show that, as
expected, $p=0$ and $p=1$ are indeed accumulation points for some hereditary
properties; we additionally determine the slope of $\operatorname{ed}_{\mathcal
H}$ at these two extreme points. Unexpectedly, we construct a hereditary
property with an accumulation point at $p=1/4$. Finally, we derive a
significant structural property about those CRGs which occur at accumulation

alignment by simultaneously accessing the source data and target data. However,
the source data are not always available due to the privacy preserving
consideration or bandwidth limitation. Source-free domain adaptation aims to
solve the above problem by performing domain adaptation without accessing the
source data. The adaptation paradigm is receiving more and more attention in
recent years, and multiple works have been proposed for unsupervised
source-free domain adaptation. However, without utilizing any supervised signal
and source data at the adaptation stage, the optimization of the target model
is unstable and fragile. To alleviate the problem, we focus on semi-supervised
domain adaptation under source-free setting. More specifically, we propose
uncertainty-guided Mixup to reduce the representation's intra-domain
discrepancy and perform inter-domain alignment without directly accessing the
source data. Finally, we conduct extensive semi-supervised domain adaptation
experiments on various datasets. Our method outperforms the recent
semi-supervised baselines and the unsupervised variant also achieves
competitive performance. The experiment codes will be released in the future.

potentially lead to reduced congestion levels without adversely prolonging
travel times. While previous studies concluded that shared rides can offer
substantial benefits, initial evidence suggests low adoption levels. We
postulate that previous studies that investigated the potential of ride-pooling
failed to account for the trade-off that users are likely to make when
considering a shared ride. We address this shortcoming by formulating user net
benefit stemming from sharing as a compensatory function where the additional
travel time and on-board discomfort need to be compensated by the price
discount for a traveller to choose a shared ride over a private ride. The
proposed formulation is embedded in a method for matching travel requests and
vehicles. We conduct a series of experiments investigating how the potential of
ride-pooling services depends on travel demand characteristics, user
preferences and the pricing policy adopted by the service provider. In
particular, the impact of various behavioural settings in terms of users'
willingness to share their ride and delay aversion on service adoption and its
operational efficiency is assessed. Our results suggest that the total vehicle
mileage savings found by previous studies is only attainable when users are
very willing to share their ride (i.e. attach low premium to private rides) and
are offered a 50% discount for doing so. We find ride-pooling transportation
distance savings as low as 15% in less favourable behavioural scenarios.

variable though its true probability distribution is unobservable to the

that we can use to approximately quantify the risk of an evaluation function
that depends on both decision and uncertainty. This empirical optimization is
vulnerable to the issues of overfitting, which could be overcome by several
data-driven robust optimization techniques. To tackle overfitting, Long et al.
(2022) propose a robust satisficing model, which is specified by a performance
target and a penalty function that measures the deviation of the uncertainty
from its nominal value, and yields solutions with superior out-of-sample
performance. We generalize the robust satisficing framework to conic
optimization problems with recourse, which has broader applications in
predictive and prescriptive analytics including risk management and statistical
supervised learning. We derive an exact semidefinite optimization formulation
for biconvex quadratic evaluation function, with quadratic penalty and
ellipsoidal support set. More importantly, under complete and bounded recourse,
and reasonably chosen polyhedral support set and penalty function, we propose
safe approximations that do not lead to infeasible problems for any reasonably
chosen target. We demonstrate that the assumption of complete and bounded
recourse is however not unimpeachable, and then introduce a novel perspective
casting technique to derive an equivalent conic optimization problem that
satisfies the stated assumptions. Finally, through a computational study on
data-driven portfolio optimization (that maximizes the expected exponential
utility of the portfolio returns), we show that the robust satisficing
solutions significantly improve over the celebrated Markowitz model, which is

used combined with real time measurements of the absorbed laser power, which
allowed us to determine the thermal conductivities without any assumptions.
Measurements on MoS2 layers with thicknesses of 5 and 14 exhibit thermal
conductivity in the range between 12 and 24 Wm-1K-1. Additionally, after
determining the thermal conductivity of a selected MoS2 sample, an hBN flake
was transferred onto it and the effective thermal conductivity of the
heterostructure was subsequently measured. Remarkably, despite that the
thickness of the hBN layer was less than a third of the thickness of the MoS2
layer, the heterostructure showed an almost eight-fold increase in the thermal
conductivity, being able to dissipate more than 10 times the laser power
without any visible sign of damage. These results are consistent with a high
thermal interface conductance between MoS2 and hBN and an efficient in-plane
heat spreading driven by hBN. Indeed, we estimate G 70 MWm-2K-1 which is
significantly higher than previously reported values. Our work therefore
demonstrates that the insertion of hBN layers in potential MoS2 based devices
holds the promise for efficient thermal management.

decision-making. Unfairness occurs when an agent with higher merit obtains a
worse outcome than an agent with lower merit. Our central point is that a
primary cause of unfairness is uncertainty. A principal or algorithm making
decisions never has access to the agents' true merit, and instead uses proxy
features that only imperfectly predict merit (e.g., GPA, star ratings,
recommendation letters). None of these ever fully capture an agent's merit; yet
existing approaches have mostly been defining fairness notions directly based
on observed features and outcomes.
  Our primary point is that it is more principled to acknowledge and model the
uncertainty explicitly. The role of observed features is to give rise to a
posterior distribution of the agents' merits. We use this viewpoint to define a
notion of approximate fairness in ranking. We call an algorithm $\phi$-fair
(for $\phi \in [0,1]$) if it has the following property for all agents $x$ and
all $k$: if agent $x$ is among the top $k$ agents with respect to merit with
probability at least $\rho$ (according to the posterior merit distribution),
then the algorithm places the agent among the top $k$ agents in its ranking
with probability at least $\phi \rho$.
  We show how to compute rankings that optimally trade off approximate fairness
against utility to the principal. In addition to the theoretical
characterization, we present an empirical analysis of the potential impact of
the approach in simulation studies. For real-world validation, we applied the
approach in the context of a paper recommendation system that we built and

instrument on the Green Bank Telescope. We present simulations of how a
source's flux density, spectral index, and angular separation from the
cluster's center affect the measured tSZE in clusters detected by the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope (ACT). By comparing the MUSTANG2 measurements with these
simulations we calibrate an empirical relationship between 1.4 GHz flux
densities from radio surveys and source contamination in ACT tSZE measurements.
We find 3 per cent of the ACT clusters have more than a 20 per cent decrease in
Compton-y but another 3 per cent have a 10 per cent increase in the Compton-y
due to the matched filters used to find clusters. As sources affect the
measured tSZE signal and hence the likelihood that a cluster will be detected,
testing the level of source contamination in the tSZE signal using a tSZE
selected catalog is inherently biased. We confirm this by comparing the ACT
tSZE catalog with optically and X-ray selected cluster catalogs. There is a
strong case for a large, high resolution survey of clusters to better
characterize their source population.

5-6 2020, we also use for the spectral analysis above 3 keV the deep NuSTAR

are characterised by the presence of a prominent and absorption-free smooth
soft X-ray excess, moderately broad OVII and FeKalpha emission lines and a lack
of a strong Compton hump. The continuum above ~3keV is very similar at both
epochs, while some variability (stronger when brighter) is present for the soft
X-ray excess. A combination of soft and hard Comptonisation by a warm and hot
corona, respectively, plus mildly relativistic disc reflection reproduce the
broadband X-ray continuum very well. The inferred warm corona temperature,
kT_warm~0.3 keV, is similar to the values found in other sub-Eddington AGN,
whereas the hot corona temperature, kT_hot~21-31 keV (depending mainly on the
assumed hot corona geometry), is found to be in the lower range of the values

First, we assume that the flux function $f$ is strictly convex and show that,
for every $ x \in \mathbb{R}$, the total variation of the composite function $f
\circ u(\cdot, x)$ is controlled by the total variation of the initial datum.
Next, we assume that $f$ is monotone and, under no convexity assumption, we
show that, for every $x$, the total variation of the left and right trace
$u(\cdot, x^\pm)$ is controlled by the total variation of the initial datum. We
also exhibit a counter-example showing that in the first result the total
variation bound does not extend to the function $u$, or equivalently that in
the second result we cannot drop the monotonicity assumption. We then discuss
applications to a source-destination model for traffic flows on road networks.
We introduce a new approach, based on the analysis of transport equations with
irregular coefficients, and, under the assumption that the network only
contains so-called T-junctions, we establish existence and uniqueness results
for merely bounded data in the class of solutions where the traffic is not
congested. Our assumptions on the network and the traffic congestion are
basically necessary to obtain well-posedness in view of a counter-example due
to Bressan and Yu. We also establish stability and propagation of $BV$
regularity, and this is again interesting in view of recent counter-examples.

  To validate the implemented functions, we applied them to specially designed

precision of the implemented functions. Applications to experimental data
showed that despite the higher computational demand, the use of the

particles, introduced by Edouard Hannezo et al. in the context of branching
morphogenesis. It is a simple model for a growth process: active, branching
particles form the growing boundary layer of an otherwise static tissue,
represented by inactive particles (Cell, 171(1):242-255.e27, 2017). The active
particles diffuse, branch and become irreversibly inactive upon collision with
a particle of arbitrary type. In absence of active particles, this system is in
a steady state, without any a priori restriction on the amount of remaining
inactive particles. Thus, while related to the well-studied FKPP-equation, this
system features a game-changing continuum of steady state solutions, where each
corresponds to a possible outcome of the growth process. However, simulations
indicate that this system self-organizes: traveling fronts with fixed shape
arise under a wide range of initial data. In the present work, we describe all
positive and bounded traveling wave solutions, and obtain necessary and
sufficient conditions for their existence. We find a surprisingly simple
symmetry in the pairs of steady states which are joined via heteroclinic wave
orbits. Our approach is constructive: we first prove the existence of almost

computer vision problems. Traditional methods rely on static images of a
calibration pattern. This raises interesting challenges towards the practical
usage of event cameras, which notably require image change to produce
sufficient measurements. The current standard for event camera calibration
therefore consists of using flashing patterns. They have the advantage of
simultaneously triggering events in all reprojected pattern feature locations,
but it is difficult to construct or use such patterns in the field. We present
the first dynamic event camera calibration algorithm. It calibrates directly
from events captured during relative motion between camera and calibration
pattern. The method is propelled by a novel feature extraction mechanism for
calibration patterns, and leverages existing calibration tools before
optimizing all parameters through a multi-segment continuous-time formulation.
As demonstrated through our results on real data, the obtained calibration
method is highly convenient and reliably calibrates from data sequences
spanning less than 10 seconds.

Seyfert 1.5 galaxy, optically classified as a spheroid, is known to host a
ionised disc, a starburst ring, and ionised gas winds on both nuclear and
galactic scales. From CO(2-1) we estimate a molecular gas mass
$M_{H_2}=1.7\times 10^9\, \rm M_{\odot}$, located within a disc of size 5.2
kpc, with $M_{dyn}$=(2.0$\pm$1.1) $\times$ $10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$ inclined
at $44\pm10$ deg. The molecular gas fraction within the disc is
$\mu_{gas}=5\%$. The gas kinematics in the nuclear region within r=700 pc
suggests the presence of a warped nuclear disc. Both the presence of a
molecular disc with ongoing star-formation in a starburst ring, and the
signatures of a minor merger, are in agreement with the scenario where galaxy
mergers produce gas destabilization, feeding both star-formation and AGN
activity. The spatially-resolved Toomre Q-parameter across the molecular disc
is in the range $Q_{gas}=0.5-10$, and shows that the disc is marginally
unstable across the starburst ring, and stable at nucleus and in a lopsided
ring-like structure located inside of the starburst ring. We find complex
molecular gas kinematics and significant kinematics perturbations at two
locations, one within 300 pc from the nucleus, and one 1.4 kpc away close to
the region with high $Q_{gas}$, that we interpret as molecular winds. The total
molecular outflow rate is in the range 6.4-17.0 $\rm M_\odot/yr$. The molecular
wind total kinetic energy is consistent with a multiphase momentum-conserving
wind driven by the AGN with $\dot{P}_{of}/\dot{P}_{rad}$ in the range 0.06-0.5.
The spatial overlap of the inner molecular wind with the ionised wind, and
their similar velocity suggest a cooling sequence within a multiphase AGN
driven wind.

evaluation. A successful approach is based on ARCH processes, which strike the
right balance between statistical properties and ease of computation. This
study focuses on quadratic ARCH processes and the theoretical conditions to
have a stable long-term behavior. In particular, the weights for the variance
estimators should sum to 1, and the variance of the innovations should be 1.
Using historical data, the realized empirical innovations can be computed, and
their statistical properties assessed. Using samples of 3 to 5 decades, the
variance of the empirical innovations are always significantly above 1, for a
sample of stock indexes, commodity indexes and FX rates. This departure points
to a short term instability, or to a fast adaptability due to changing
conditions. Another theoretical condition on the innovations is to have a zero
mean. This condition is also investigated empirically, with some time series
showing significant departure from zero.

ethanol-induced unfolding is largely ascribed to its hydrophobic parts, its
effect on protein phase separation and inter-protein interactions remains
poorly understood. Here, the effects of ethanol and NaCl on the phase behavior
and interactions of protein solutions are studied in terms of the metastable
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and the second virial coefficient $B_2$
using lysozyme solutions. Determination of the phase diagrams shows that the
cloud-point temperatures are reduced and raised by the addition of ethanol and
salt, respectively. The observed trends can be explained using the extended law
of corresponding states as changes of $B_2$. The results for $B_2$ agree
quantitatively with those of static light scattering and small-angle X-ray
scattering experiments. Furthermore, $B_2$ values calculated based on
inter-protein interactions described by the Derjaguin--Landau--Verwey--Overbeek

electrostatic screening due to the ethanol and salt content quantitatively
agree with the experimentally observed $B_2$ values.

atomically thin form, could allow for novel proton conductive, ion selective,
osmotic power generation, or solvent filtration membranes. The interest arises
from the possibility of controlling their properties by exchanging ions in the
crystal lattice. However, the ion exchange process itself remains largely
unexplored in atomically thin materials. Here we use atomic-resolution scanning
transmission electron microscopy to study the dynamics of the process and
reveal the binding sites of individual ions in atomically thin and artificially
restacked clays and micas. Imaging ion exchange after different exposure time
and for different crystal thicknesses, we find that the ion diffusion constant,
D, for the interlayer space of atomically thin samples is up to 10^4 times
larger than in bulk crystals and approaches its value in free water.
Surprisingly, samples where no bulk exchange is expected display fast exchange
if the mica layers are twisted and restacked; but in this case, the exchanged
ions arrange in islands controlled by the moir\'e superlattice dimensions. We
attribute the fast ion diffusion to enhanced interlayer expandability resulting
from weaker interlayer binding forces in both atomically thin and restacked
materials. Finally, we demonstrate images of individual surface cations for
these materials, which had remained elusive in previous studies. This work
provides atomic scale insights into ion diffusion in highly confined spaces and
suggests strategies to design novel exfoliated clays membranes.

background electric fields from 4.5 to 26 kV/cm in a 4 cm gap. They can
accelerate or decelerate depending on the background electric field. Many
experiments have shown that a streamer keeps propagating in a stable manner in
the so-called stability field of 4.5 to 5 kV/cm. Our fluid streamer simulations
in STP air show that: (1) In a homogeneous field larger than 4.675 kV/cm, a
single streamer accelerates, and in a lower field, it decelerates and
eventually stagnates with a small radius and very high field enhancement. (2)
In a field of 4.675 kV/cm, the streamer head propagates with an approximately
constant velocity of 6.7 x 10$^4$ m/s and an optical radius of 55 $\mu$m over
distances of several centimeters as a stable coherent structure. These values
for the radius and velocity agree well with measurements of so-called minimal
streamers. (3) Behind the uniformly translating streamer head, the channel
conductivity decreases due to electron attachment and recombination, and the
electric field returns to its background value about 1 cm behind the head. The
propagation behavior of the solitary streamer agrees with the original
definition of the stability field, which is the homogeneous field in which a

$\mathbb Z$: independent random walks, the exclusion process, and the inclusion
process. We allow particles to switch their jump rate (the rate identifies the
type of particle) between $1$ (fast particles) and $\epsilon\in[0,1]$ (slow
particles). The switch between the two jump rates happens at rate
$\gamma\in(0,\infty)$. In the exclusion process, the interaction is such that
each site can be occupied by at most one particle of each type. In the
inclusion process, the interaction takes places between particles of the same
type at different sites and between particles of different type at the same
site. We derive the macroscopic limit equations for the three systems, obtained
after scaling space by $N^{-1}$, time by $N^2$, the switching rate by $N^{-2}$,
and letting $N\to\infty$. The limit equations for the macroscopic densities
associated to the fast and slow particles is the well-studied double
diffusivity model. This system of reaction-diffusion equations was introduced
to model polycrystal diffusion and dislocation pipe diffusion, with the goal to
overcome the limitations imposed by Fick's law. In order to investigate the
microscopic out-of-equilibrium properties, we analyse the system on
$[N]=\{1,\ldots,N\}$, adding boundary reservoirs at sites $1$ and $N$ of fast
and slow particles, respectively. Inside $[N]$ particles move as before, but
now particles are injected and absorbed at sites $1$ and $N$ with prescribed
rates that depend on the particle type. We compute the steady-state density
profile and the steady-state current. It turns out that uphill diffusion is
possible, i.e., the total flow can be in the direction of increasing total
density. This phenomenon, which cannot occur in a single-type particle system,
is a violation of Fick's law made possible by the switching between types.

challenge of finding parking through the Capacitated Delivery Problem with
Parking (CDPP). Unlike other models in the literature, the CDPP accounts for
the search time for parking in the objective and minimizes the completion time
of the delivery tour. When we restrict the customer geography to a complete
grid, we identify conditions for when a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
solution that parks at each customer is an optimal solution to the CDPP. We
then determine when the search time for parking is large enough for the CDPP
optimal solution to differ from this TSP solution. We also identify model
improvements that allow reasonably-sized instances of the CDPP to be solved
exactly. We introduce a heuristic for the CDPP that quickly finds high quality
solutions to large instances. Computational experiments show that parking
matters in last-mile delivery optimization. The CDPP outperforms industry
practice and models in the literature showing the greatest advantage when the
search time for parking is high. This analysis provides immediate ways to
improve routing in last-mile delivery.

situ surface measurements that address several fundamental science questions
raised by MESSENGER's pioneering exploration of Mercury. Such measurements are
needed to understand Mercury's unique mineralogy and geochemistry; to
characterize the proportionally massive core's structure; to measure the
planet's active and ancient magnetic fields at the surface; to investigate the
processes that alter the surface and produce the exosphere; and to provide
ground truth for current and future remote datasets. NASA's Planetary Mission
Concept Studies program awarded this study to evaluate the feasibility of
accomplishing transformative science through a New-Frontiers-class, landed
mission to Mercury in the next decade. The resulting mission concept achieves
one full Mercury year (~88 Earth days) of surface operations with an ambitious,
high-heritage, landed science payload, corresponding well with the New
Frontiers mission framework. The 11-instrument science payload is delivered to
a landing site within Mercury's widely distributed low-reflectance material,
and addresses science goals and objectives encompassing geochemistry,
geophysics, the Mercury space environment, and surface geology. This mission

invariant as a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of rank invariants of indicator
modules supported on segments in the poset. It can also be enriched to encode
the generalized rank invariant as a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of
generalized rank invariants in fixed classes of interval modules. In the paper
we develop the theory behind these rank invariant decompositions, showing under
what conditions they exist and are unique -- so the signed barcode is
canonically defined. We also connect them to the line of work on generalized
persistence diagrams via M\""obius inversions, deriving explicit formulas to
compute a rank decomposition and its associated signed barcode. Finally, we
show that, similarly to its unsigned counterpart, the signed barcode has its
roots in algebra, coming from a projective resolution of the module in some

a family of generalized coloring problems (list homomorphisms) on
bounded-treewidth graphs. Given graphs $G$, $H$, and lists $L(v)\subseteq V(H)$
for every $v\in V(G)$, a {\em list homomorphism} is a function $f:V(G)\to V(H)$
that preserves the edges (i.e., $uv\in E(G)$ implies $f(u)f(v)\in E(H)$) and
respects the lists (i.e., $f(v)\in L(v))$. Standard techniques show that if $G$
is given with a tree decomposition of width $t$, then the number of list
homomorphisms can be counted in time $|V(H)|^t\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. Our
main result is determining, for every fixed graph $H$, how much the base
$|V(H)|$ in the running time can be improved. For a connected graph $H$ we
define $\operatorname{irr}(H)$ the following way: if $H$ has a loop or is
nonbipartite, then $\operatorname{irr}(H)$ is the maximum size of a set
$S\subseteq V(H)$ where any two vertices have different neighborhoods; if $H$
is bipartite, then $\operatorname{irr}(H)$ is the maximum size of such a set
that is fully in one of the bipartition classes. For disconnected $H$, we
define $\operatorname{irr}(H)$ as the maximum of $\operatorname{irr}(C)$ over
every connected component $C$ of $H$. We show that, for every fixed graph $H$,
the number of list homomorphisms from $(G,L)$ to $H$
  * can be counted in time $\operatorname{irr}(H)^t\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ if
a tree decomposition of $G$ having width at most $t$ is given in the input, and

n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ for any $\epsilon>0$, even if a tree decomposition of $G$
having width at most $t$ is given in the input, unless the #SETH fails.

circuits is a complex system that is not yet fully understood. Surface
electromyography (EMG) can be used to study muscle behavior from the outside.
Computer simulations with detailed biophysical models provide a non-invasive
tool to interpret EMG signals and gain new insights into the system. The
numerical solution of such multi-scale models imposes high computational work
loads, which restricts their application to short simulation time spans or
coarse resolutions. We tackled this challenge by providing scalable software
employing instruction-level and task-level parallelism, suitable numerical
methods and efficient data handling. We implemented a comprehensive,
state-of-the-art, multi-scale multi-physics model framework that can simulate
surface EMG signals and muscle contraction as a result of neuromuscular
stimulation.
  This work describes the model framework and its numerical discretization,
develops new algorithms for mesh generation and parallelization, covers the use
and implementation of our software OpenDiHu, and evaluates its computational
performance in numerous use cases. We obtain a speedup of several hundred
compared to a baseline solver from the literature and demonstrate, that our
distributed-memory parallelization and the use of High Performance Computing
resources enables us to simulate muscular surface EMG of the biceps brachii
muscle with realistic muscle fiber counts of several hundred thousands. We find
that certain model effects are only visible with such high resolution. In
conclusion, our software contributes to more realistic simulations of the
neuromuscular system and provides a tool for applied researchers to complement
in vivo experiments with in-silico studies. It can serve as a building block to
set up comprehensive models for more organs in the musculoskeletal system.

the spreading dynamics of an epidemic. Specifically, it explores the
interconnections between HAM and its effect on the early spread of the COVID-19
virus. During the early stages of the pandemic, effective reproduction numbers
exhibited a high correlation with human mobility patterns, leading to a
hypothesis that the HAM system can be studied as a coupled system with disease
spread dynamics. This study applies the generalized Koopman framework with
control inputs to determine the nonlinear disease spread dynamics and the
input-output characteristics as a locally linear controlled dynamical system.
The approach solely relies on the snapshots of spatiotemporal data and does not
require any knowledge of the system's physical laws. We exploit the Koopman
operator framework by utilizing the Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with
Control (HDMDc) algorithm to obtain a linear disease spread model incorporating
human mobility as a control input. The study demonstrated that the proposed
methodology could capture the impact of local mobility on the early dynamics of
the ongoing global pandemic. The obtained locally linear model can accurately
forecast the number of new infections for various prediction windows ranging
from two to four weeks. The study corroborates a leader-follower relationship
between mobility and disease spread dynamics. In addition, the effect of delay

sensitive to magnetic clutters and depend on local ambient magnetic fields,
which frequently degrades their performance. Also, these techniques often
require pre-known mapping surveys of the area, or the presence of active
beacons, which are not always available. We embed small-volume and large-moment
magnets in pre-known locations and arrange them in specific geometric
constellations that create magnetic superstructure patterns of supervised
magnetic signatures. These signatures constitute an unambiguous magnetic
environment with respect to the moving sensor carrier. The localization
algorithm learns the unique patterns of the scattered magnets during training
and detects them from the ongoing streaming of data during localization. Our
contribution is twofold. First, we deploy passive permanent magnets that do not
require a power supply, in contrast to active magnetic transmitters. Second, we
perform localization based on smartphone motion rather than on static
positioning of the magnetometer. In our previous study, we considered a single
superstructure pattern. Here, we present an extended version of that algorithm
for multi-superstructure localization, which covers a broader localization area

when evaluating biomarkers. In this paper, we present one evaluation strategy
by using leave-one-study-out (LOSO) in place of conventional cross-validation
(cv) methods to account for the potential heterogeneity across trials used for
building and testing the biomarkers. To demonstrate the performance of K-fold
vs LOSO cv in estimating the effect size of biomarkers, we leveraged data from
clinical trials and simulation studies. In our assessment, LOSO cv provided a
more objective estimate of the future performance. This conclusion remained
true across different evaluation metrics and different statistical methods.

hundreds of seconds duration. Pulse profiles were changing significantly with
time and the luminosity of the source. An increase in the height of the peak of
the pulse profiles was observed with energy. The pulse fraction increases with
energy and at the end of the outburst. The variation of the pulse profile with
time indicates the transition of the pulsar in different accretion regimes. The
absorption like feature at 10 keV shows a positive correlation with the
luminosity and along with other spectral parameters this feature was also pulse
phase dependent. As the distance to the source is not precisely known hence we
cannot confirm this feature to be CSRF and also cannot ignore other possible
explanations of the feature. Another absorption like feature about 30 keV was
observed in the spectra of the last two \textit{NuSTAR} observations and has
line energy of about 30.37$\pm$0.55 and 30.23$\pm$0.62 keV respectively. We

optimization algorithm to calculate low-order statistical moments of the
mechanical-mathematical model response. This procedure, known as robust
topology optimization, can optimize the mean of the compliance while
simultaneously minimizing its standard deviation. In order to address possible
variabilities in the loads applied to the mechanical system of interest,
magnitude and direction of the external forces are assumed to be uncertain. In
this probabilistic framework, forces are described as a random field or a set
of random variables. Representation of the random objects and propagation of
load uncertainties through the model are efficiently done through
Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve and polynomial chaos expansions. We take advantage of using
polygonal elements, which have been shown to be effective in suppressing
checkerboard patterns and reducing mesh dependency in the solution of topology
optimization problems. Accuracy and applicability of the proposed methodology
are demonstrated by means of several topology optimization examples. The
obtained results, which are in excellent agreement with reference solutions

to the Fabry-Perot resonance, only the EM waves with discrete frequencies can
be squeezed and, as far as we know, in the previous energy-squeezing devices,
stringent requirements of the materials or the geometrical shape are needed. We
note that the structures filled with epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mediums as
reported in some works can squeeze and tunnel EM waves at frequencies (e.g.
plasma frequency). However, the group velocity is usually near zero which means
few EM information travel through the structures. In this paper, low-loss
energy squeezing and tunneling (EST) based on unidirectional modes were
demonstrated in YIG-based one-way waveguides at microwave frequencies.
According to our theoretical analysis and the simulations using finite element
method, broadband EST was achieved and the EM EST was observed even for
extremely bended structures. Besides, similar EM EST was achieved in a
realistic three-dimensional remanence-based one-way waveguide as well. The
unidirectional modes-based EST paving the way to ultra-subwavelength EM

  Africa Post-COVID-19","This chapter has been submitted to the Annual Trends and Outlook
  Report (ATOR, 2021). The ATOR is a flagship report of the Regional Strategic
  Analysis and Knowledge Support System (ReSAKSS) program at AKADEMIYA2063. The
  chapter has 22 pages, 14 images, 9 tables, and 36 references",,,"Annual Trends and Outlook Report (ATOR, 2021)","cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  In the agricultural sector, the COVID-19 threatens to lead to a severe food
security crisis in the region, with disruptions in the food supply chain and
agricultural production expected to contract between 2.6% and 7%. From the food
crop production side, the travel bans and border closures, the late reception
and the use of agricultural inputs such as imported seeds, fertilizers, and
pesticides could lead to poor food crop production performances. Another layer
of disruption introduced by the mobility restriction measures is the scarcity
of agricultural workers, mainly seasonal workers. The lockdown measures and
border closures limit seasonal workers' availability to get to the farm on time
for planting and harvesting activities. Moreover, most of the imported
agricultural inputs travel by air, which the pandemic has heavily impacted.
Such transportation disruptions can also negatively affect the food crop
production system.
  This chapter assesses food crop production levels in 2020 -- before the
harvesting period -- in all African regions and four staples such as maize,
cassava, rice, and wheat. The production levels are predicted using the
combination of biogeophysical remote sensing data retrieved from satellite
images and machine learning artificial neural networks (ANNs) technique. The
remote sensing products are used as input variables and the ANNs as the
predictive modeling framework. The input remote sensing products are the
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the daytime Land Surface
Temperature (LST), rainfall data, and agricultural lands' Evapotranspiration
(ET). The output maps and data are made publicly available on a web-based
platform, AAgWa (Africa Agriculture Watch, www.aagwa.org), to facilitate access
to such information to policymakers, deciders, and other stakeholders.

become an important part of the work-flow. The widespread use of mobile devices
opens up wide possibilities for using OCR technologies in everyday life.
However, lack of training data for new research in this area remains relevant.
In this article, we present a new dataset consisting of real shots on
smartphones and demonstrate the effectiveness of profile normalization in this
task. In addition, the influence of various augmentations during the training
of models for analyzing document images on smartphones is studied in detail.
Our dataset is publicly available.
