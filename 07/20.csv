analyze the impact of seed and training bias on the output of an
activity-conditioned graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE). Leveraging a
massive, labeled dataset corresponding to the dopamine D2 receptor, our
graph-based generative model is shown to excel in producing desired conditioned
activities and favorable unconditioned physical properties in generated

activation, deactivation, or retention of activity of molecular seeds, and we
apply independent deep learning classifiers to verify the generative results.
Overall, we uncover relationships between noise, molecular seeds, and training
set selection across a range of latent-space sampling procedures, providing
important insights for practical AI-driven molecule generation.

identification at a distance. In practice, occlusion usually occurs and
seriously affects accuracy of gait recognition. However, there is no available
database to support in-depth research of this problem, and state-of-arts gait
recognition methods have not paid enough attention to it, thus this paper
focuses on gait recognition under occlusion. We collect a new gait recognition
database called OG RGB+D database, which breaks through the limitation of other
gait databases and includes multimodal gait data of various occlusions
(self-occlusion, active occlusion, and passive occlusion) by our multiple
synchronous Azure Kinect DK sensors data acquisition system (multi-Kinect SDAS)
that can be also applied in security situations. Because Azure Kinect DK can
simultaneously collect multimodal data to support different types of gait
recognition algorithms, especially enables us to effectively obtain
camera-centric multi-person 3D poses, and multi-view is better to deal with
occlusion than single-view. In particular, the OG RGB+D database provides
accurate silhouettes and the optimized human 3D joints data (OJ) by fusing data
collected by multi-Kinects which are more accurate in human pose representation
under occlusion. We also use the OJ data to train an advanced 3D multi-person
pose estimation model to improve its accuracy of pose estimation under
occlusion for universality. Besides, as human pose is less sensitive to
occlusion than human appearance, we propose a novel gait recognition method
SkeletonGait based on human dual skeleton model using a framework of siamese
spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (siamese ST-GCN). The evaluation
results demonstrate that SkeletonGait has competitive performance compared with
state-of-art gait recognition methods on OG RGB+D database and popular CAISA-B

complement sparse visual SLAM systems which takes as input the camera poses,
keyframes and sparse points produced by the SLAM system and predicts a dense

autoencoder (VAE) which is conditioned on intensity, sparse depth and
reprojection error images from sparse SLAM to predict an uncertainty-aware
dense depth map. The use of a VAE then enables us to refine the dense depth

integration with arbitrary metric sparse SLAM systems without delaying the main

changes to the platform causally affect various outcomes of interest. However,
experimentation on online platforms has been criticized for having, among other
issues, a lack of meaningful oversight and user consent. As platforms give
users greater agency, it becomes possible to conduct observational studies in
which users self-select into the treatment of interest as an alternative to
experiments in which the platform controls whether the user receives treatment
or not. In this paper, we conduct four large-scale within-study comparisons on
Twitter aimed at assessing the effectiveness of observational studies derived
from user self-selection on online platforms. In a within-study comparison,
treatment effects from an observational study are assessed based on how
effectively they replicate results from a randomized experiment with the same
target population. We test the naive difference in group means estimator, exact
matching, regression adjustment, and inverse probability of treatment weighting
while controlling for plausible confounding variables. In all cases, all
observational estimates perform poorly at recovering the ground-truth estimate
from the analogous randomized experiments. In all cases except one, the
observational estimates have the opposite sign of the randomized estimate. Our
results suggest that observational studies derived from user self-selection are
a poor alternative to randomized experimentation on online platforms. In
discussing our results, we postulate a ""Catch-22"" that suggests that the

gradients of the tidal gravitational fields. With this extension of the linear
model mediating between the brightness distribution and the tidal gravitational
fields and with a quantification of the shape of the galaxy at third order
provided by the HOLICs-formalism, we are able to compute angular spectra of
intrinsic flexions and the cross-spectra with weak lensing flexions. Spectra
for intrinsic flexions are typically an order of magnitude smaller than lensing
flexions, exactly as in the case of intrinsic ellipticity in comparison to weak
shear. We find a negative cross correlation between intrinsic and extrinsic
gravitational flexions, too, complementing the analogous correlation between
intrinsic and extrinsic ellipticity. After discussing the physical details of
the alignment model to provide intrinsic flexions and their scaling properties,
we quantify the observability of the intrinsic and extrinsic flexions and
estimate with the Fisher-formalism how well the alignment parameter can be
determined from a Euclid-like weak lensing survey. Intrinsic flexions are very
difficult to measure and yield appreciable signals only with highly optimistic
parameter choices and noise levels, while being basically undetectable for more

without any knowledge of the problem and without any assumption on the
least-squares matrix except that it is sparse. We exploit the structure of the
symmetric positive definite normal equations matrix and use the concept of
algebraic local symmetric positive semi-definite splittings to introduce
two-level Schwarz preconditioners for least-squares problems. The condition
number of the preconditioned normal equations is shown to be theoretically
bounded independently of the number of subdomains in the splitting. This upper
bound can be adjusted using a single parameter $\tau$ that the user can
specify. We discuss how the new preconditioners can be implemented on top of
the PETSc library using only 150 lines of Fortran, C, or Python code. Problems
arising from practical applications are used to compare the performance of the
proposed new preconditioner with that of other preconditioners.

rapid pace. As a result, research and development regarding how to moderate
online communities is being out-paced. In this paper, we present a novel
framework that will allow moderation researchers and practitioners to not only
keep-up with the diverse landscape of available platforms and affordances, but
also comprehensively represent and analyze moderation on these platforms. The
MIC framework represents a social platform's moderation ecosystem using a
base-set of 12 platform-level affordances, along with a notion of the
inter-affordance relationships that can exist between them. These affordances
fall into the three categories -- Members, Infrastructure, and Content -- that
are derived from Grimmelmann's taxonomy of moderation, a framework that is
already widely accepted and used by the moderation research community. To show
how MIC serves as an insightful augmentation of Grimmelmann's lens, we begin by
describing how its components have already been shown to impact Grimmelmann's
techniques for moderation. Then, we demonstrate the advantages of using an
affordance-aware framework like MIC by analyzing several social platforms over
the course of two case studies. First, we analyze individual platforms using
MIC and demonstrate how MIC can be used to examine the effects of platform
changes on the moderation ecosystem and identify potential new challenges in
moderation. Next, use MIC to systematically compare three platforms and propose
potential moderation mechanisms that each can adapt. Moderation researchers and
stakeholders can use such comparisons to uncover where platforms can emulate
established, successful and better-studied platforms, as well as learn from the
pitfalls other platforms have encountered.

  treatment effects: A simulation study",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Observational studies are often used to understand relationships between
exposures and outcomes. They do not, however, allow conclusions about causal
relationships to be drawn unless statistical techniques are used to account for
the imbalance of confounders across exposure groups. Propensity score and
balance weighting (PSBW) are useful techniques that aim to reduce the
imbalances between exposure groups by weighting the groups to look alike on the
observed confounders. Despite the plethora of available methods to estimate
PSBW, there is little guidance on what one defines as adequate balance, and
unbiased and robust estimation of the causal treatment effect is not guaranteed
unless several conditions hold. Accurate inference requires that 1. the
treatment allocation mechanism is known, 2. the relationship between the
baseline covariates and the outcome is known, 3. adequate balance of baseline
covariates is achieved post-weighting, 4. a proper set of covariates to control
for confounding bias is known, and 5. a large enough sample size is available.
In this article, we use simulated data of various sizes to investigate the
influence of these five factors on statistical inference. Our findings provide
evidence that the maximum Kolmogorov- Smirnov statistic is the proper
statistical measure to assess balance on the baseline covariates, in contrast
to the mean standardised mean difference used in many applications, and 0.1 is
a suitable threshold to consider as acceptable balance. Finally, we recommend
that 60-80 observations, per confounder per treatment group, are required to
obtain a reliable and unbiased estimation of the causal treatment effect.

a single image with enhanced information. In recent years, state-of-the-art
methods have adopted Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to encode meaningful
features for image fusion. Specifically, CNN-based methods perform image fusion
by fusing local features. However, they do not consider long-range dependencies
that are present in the image. Transformer-based models are designed to
overcome this by modeling the long-range dependencies with the help of
self-attention mechanism. This motivates us to propose a novel Image Fusion
Transformer (IFT) where we develop a transformer-based multi-scale fusion
strategy that attends to both local and long-range information (or global
context). The proposed method follows a two-stage training approach. In the
first stage, we train an auto-encoder to extract deep features at multiple
scales. In the second stage, multi-scale features are fused using a
Spatio-Transformer (ST) fusion strategy. The ST fusion blocks are comprised of
a CNN and a transformer branch which capture local and long-range features,
respectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
the proposed method performs better than many competitive fusion algorithms.
Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of the proposed ST fusion strategy with
an ablation analysis. The source code is available at:

$1/2$ at any time, due to the additional time-reversal and charge conjugation
symmetries. In particular, for a quench from the trivial to the topological

occupancies, independently of the quench protocol, the temperature of the
pre-quench thermal state or the presence of chiral disorder. However, a
suitably designed local quench from/to a SSH ring threaded by a magnetic flux
can break these additional symmetries while preserving the chiral one. Then,
real-space effects of the quench do appear and exhibit different dynamical
features in the topological and in the trivial phases. Moreover, when the
particle filling is different from a half and the pre-quench state is not
insulating, the dynamical appearance of the topological edge states is visible
already in a chain, it survives time averaging and can be observed also in the
presence of chiral-breaking disorder and for instantaneous quenches.

First, we incorporate a familiar small multiples configuration in which every

permutables design gallery, in which a single data point is drawn according to
each alternative glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between data

produce their own tritium. In the so-called breeding blanket of a reactor, the
neutron bombardment of lithium will produce the desired tritium, but also
helium, which can trigger nucleation mechanisms owing to the very low
solubility of helium in liquid metals. An understanding of the underlying
microscopic processes is important for improving the efficiency, sustainability
and reliability of the fusion energy conversion process. A spontaneous creation
of helium drops or bubbles in the liquid metal used as breeding material in
some designs may be a serious issue for the performance of the breeding
blankets. This phenomenon has yet to be fully studied and understood. This work
aims to provide some insight on the behavior of lithium and helium mixtures at
experimentally corresponding operating conditions (843 K and pressures between
0.1 and 7 GPa). We report a microscopic study of the thermodynamic, structural
and dynamical properties of lithium-helium mixtures, as a first step to the
simulation of the environment in a nuclear fusion power plant. We introduce a
microscopic model devised to describe the formation of helium drops in the
thermodynamic range considered. A transition from a miscible homogeneous
mixture to a phase-separated one, in which helium drops are nucleated, is
observed as the pressure is increased above 0.175 GPa. The diffusion
coefficient of lithium (2 {\AA} 2 /ps) is in excellent agreement with reference
experimental data, whereas the diffusion coefficient of helium is in the range
of 1 {\AA} 2 /ps and tends to decrease as pressure increases. The radii of
helium drops have been found to be between 1 and 2 {\AA}.

standard for Bayesian inference in large-scale models, such as Bayesian neural
networks. Since practitioners face speed versus accuracy tradeoffs in these
models, variational inference (VI) is often the preferable option.
Unfortunately, VI makes strong assumptions on both the factorization and
functional form of the posterior. In this work, we propose a new non-parametric
variational approximation that makes no assumptions about the approximate
posterior's functional form and allows practitioners to specify the exact
dependencies the algorithm should respect or break. The approach relies on a
new Langevin-type algorithm that operates on a modified energy function, where
parts of the latent variables are averaged over samples from earlier iterations
of the Markov chain. This way, statistical dependencies can be broken in a

radio continuum survey at 76-227 MHz of the entire southern sky (Declination
$<+30\deg$) with an angular resolution of $\approx 2$ arcmin. In this paper, we
combine GLEAM data with optical spectroscopy from the 6dF Galaxy Survey to
construct a sample of 1,590 local (median $z \approx 0.064$) radio sources with
$S_{200\,\mathrm{MHz}} > 55$ mJy across an area of $\approx
16,700~\mathrm{deg}^{2}$. From the optical spectra, we identify the dominant
physical process responsible for the radio emission from each galaxy: 73 per
cent are fuelled by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and 27 per cent by star
formation. We present the local radio luminosity function for AGN and
star-forming galaxies at 200 MHz and characterise the typical radio spectra of
these two populations between 76 MHz and $\sim 1$ GHz. For the AGN, the median
spectral index between 200 MHz and $\sim 1$ GHz, $\alpha_{\mathrm{high}}$, is
$-0.600 \pm 0.010$ (where $S \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) and the median spectral
index within the GLEAM band, $\alpha_{\mathrm{low}}$, is $-0.704 \pm 0.011$.
For the star-forming galaxies, the median value of $\alpha_{\mathrm{high}}$ is
$-0.650 \pm 0.010$ and the median value of $\alpha_{\mathrm{low}}$ is $-0.596
\pm 0.015$. Among the AGN population, flat-spectrum sources are more common at
lower radio luminosity, suggesting the existence of a significant population of
weak radio AGN that remain core-dominated even at low frequencies. However,
around 4 per cent of local radio AGN have ultra-steep radio spectra at low
frequencies ($\alpha_{\mathrm{low}} < -1.2$). These ultra-steep-spectrum
sources span a wide range in radio luminosity, and further work is needed to
clarify their nature.

reliable signal that provides complementary information for learning to

features seen in Type Ia supernovae around maximum light. With the probes
exploring different distances from the supernova; NaID > 10$^{17}$cm,
high-velocity CaII features < 10$^{15}$cm. For this, we have used a new
intermediate-resolution X-shooter spectral sample of 15 Type Ia supernovae. We
do not identify a link between these two probes, implying either that, one (or
both) is not physically related to the presence of CSM or that the occurrence
of CSM at the distance explored by one probe is not linked to its presence at
the distance probed by the other. However, the previously identified
statistical excess in the presence of blueshifted (over redshifted) NaID
absorption is confirmed in this sample at high significance and is found to be
stronger in Type Ia supernovae hosted by late-type galaxies. This excess is
difficult to explain as being from an interstellar-medium origin as has been
suggested by some recent modelling, as such an origin is not expected to show a
bias for blueshifted absorption. However, a circumstellar origin for these
features also appears unsatisfactory based on our new results given the lack of

for the operation of next-generation fusion reactors. Elemental composition,
particularly the amount of Cr present, and irradiation can have separate and
synergistic effects on the mechanical properties of ferritic/martensitic
steels. The study of ion-irradiated FeCr alloys is useful for gaining a
mechanistic understanding of irradiation damage in steels. Previous studies of
ion-irradiated FeCr did not clearly distinguish between the nucleation of
dislocations to initiate plasticity, and their propagation through the material
as plasticity progresses.
  In this study, Fe3Cr, Fe5Cr, and Fe10Cr were irradiated with 20 MeV Fe$^{3+}$
ions at room temperature to nominal doses of 0.01 dpa and 0.1 dpa.
Nanoindentation was carried out with Berkovich and spherical indenter tips to
study the nucleation of dislocations and their subsequent propagation. The
presence of irradiation-induced defects reduced the theoretical shear stress
and barrier for dislocation nucleation. The presence of Cr further enhanced
this effect due to increased retention of irradiation defects. However, this
combined effect is still small compared to dislocation nucleation from
pre-existing sources such as Frank-Read sources and grain boundaries. The yield
strength, an indicator of dislocation mobility, of FeCr increased with
irradiation damage and Cr. The increased retention of irradiation defects due
to the presence of Cr also further increased the yield strength. Reduced work
hardening capacity was also observed following irradiation. The synergistic
effects of Cr and irradiation damage in FeCr appear to be more important for
the propagation of dislocations, rather than their nucleation.

quantities in 2d Model A $-$ most scaling exponents and correlation functions

experimental assessment. Here, we perform such assessment from a comprehensive
study of the coarsening of 2d twisted nematic liquid crystals whose kinetics is
induced by a super-fast switching from a spatiotemporally chaotic state to a
two-phase concurrent, equilibrium one. Tracking the dynamics via optical
microscopy, we firstly show the sharp evidence of well-established Model A
aspects, such as the dynamic exponent $z=2$ and the dynamic scaling hypothesis,
to then move forward. We confirm the Bray-Humayun theory for Porod's regime
describing intradomain length scales of spatial correlators, and show that
their nontrivial decay beyond that regime is captured in a free-from-parameter
fashion by Gaussian theories. These paradigmatic theories, however, do not
perform well for time-related Model A statistics. We reveal that the collapsed
form of two-time correlators is best accounted for by the local scaling
invariance theory, along with the Fisher-Huse conjecture. We also suggest the
true value for the local persistence exponent, in disfavour of Gaussian models,

amounts of expert demonstrations for a given task. While methods for collecting
human demonstrations are becoming easier with teleoperation methods and the use
of low-cost assistive tools, we often still require 100-1000 demonstrations for
every task to learn a visual representation and policy. To address this, we
turn to an alternate form of data that does not require task-specific
demonstrations -- play. Playing is a fundamental method children use to learn a
set of skills and behaviors and visual representations in early learning.
Importantly, play data is diverse, task-agnostic, and relatively cheap to
obtain. In this work, we propose to use playful interactions in a
self-supervised manner to learn visual representations for downstream tasks. We
collect 2 hours of playful data in 19 diverse environments and use
self-predictive learning to extract visual representations. Given these
representations, we train policies using imitation learning for two downstream
tasks: Pushing and Stacking. We demonstrate that our visual representations
generalize better than standard behavior cloning and can achieve similar
performance with only half the number of required demonstrations. Our

We then instantiate this in a robot-aware model-based RL policy by training
modular dynamics models that couple a transferable, robot-aware world dynamics

This also enables us to set up visual planning costs that separately consider
the robot agent and the world. Our experiments on tabletop manipulation tasks
with simulated and real robots demonstrate that these plug-in improvements
dramatically boost the transferability of visual model-based RL policies, even
permitting zero-shot transfer of visual manipulation skills onto new robots.

all these geometries, making their contribution vanish once again. This
mechanism works for both single- and multi-boundary path integrals. In
particular, only disconnected geometries without wormholes contribute to the
gravitational path integral which computes the index, and the factorization
puzzle that plagues the black hole partition function is resolved for the
supersymmetric index. Finally, we classify all other single-centered geometries

at $89$ $\mu$m with HAWC+/SOFIA, here, we measure that the polarized flux is

the B-field: a constant B-field orientation and dominated by $m=0$ at $89$
$\mu$m, and a spiral B-field dominated by $m=2$ at radio. We show that the
B-field at 89 $\mu$m is concentrated in the warmest region of a shock driven by
the galactic-bar dynamics in the contact regions between the outer-bar with the

energetic explosion, some of the hydrogen envelope of a red supergiant (RSG)
progenitor may infall onto the newborn black hole (BH). Within the Athena++
framework, we perform three-dimensional, hydrodynamical simulations of
idealized models of supergiant convection and collapse in order to assess
whether the infall of the convective envelope can give rise to
rotationally-supported material, even if the star has zero angular momentum
overall. Our dimensionless, polytropic models are applicable to the
optically-thick hydrogen envelope of non-rotating RSGs and cover a factor of 20
in stellar radius. At all radii, the specific angular momentum due to random
convective flows implies associated circularization radii of 10 - 1500 times
the innermost stable circular orbit of the BH. During collapse, the angular
momentum vector of the convective flows is approximately conserved and is
slowly varying on the timescale relevant to forming disks at small radii. Our
results indicate that otherwise failed explosions of RSGs lead to the formation
of rotationally-supported flows that are capable of driving outflows to large
radii and powering observable transients. When the BH is able to accrete most
of the hydrogen envelope, the final BH spin parameter is $\sim$ 0.5, even

spin parameter is generally lower and never exceeds 0.8. We discuss the

their hosts and the formation of the first collapsed objects in the Universe.
While some progress was made in determining the X-ray detected fraction of MBHs
in dwarfs, with typical values ranging from $0\%$ to $6\%$, their overall
active fraction, ${\cal A}$, is still largely unconstrained. Here, we develop a
theoretical model to predict the multiwavelength active fraction of MBHs in
dwarf galaxies starting from first principles and based on the physical
properties of the host, namely, its stellar mass and angular momentum content.
We find multiwavelength active fractions for MBHs, accreting at typically low
rates, ranging from $5\%$ to $22\%$, and increasing with the stellar mass of
the host as ${\cal A} \sim(\log_{10}M_{\star})^{4.5}$. If dwarfs are
characterized by low-metallicity environments, the active fraction may reach
$\sim 30\%$ for the most massive hosts. For galaxies with stellar mass in the
range $10^7<M_{\star} [M_{\odot}]<10^{10}$, our predictions are in agreement
with occupation fractions derived from simulations and semi-analytical models.
Additionally, we provide a fitting formula to predict the probability of
finding an active MBH in a dwarf galaxy from observationally derived data. This
model will be instrumental to guide future observational efforts to find MBHs
in dwarfs. The James Webb Space Telescope, in particular, will play a crucial
role in detecting MBHs in dwarfs, possibly uncovering active fractions $\sim 3$
times larger than current X-ray surveys.

$\textit{Fermi}$ data are an unresolved population of faint millisecond pulsars
(MSPs) and dark-matter (DM) annihilation. The dichotomy between these
explanations is typically reflected by modeling them as two separate emission
components. However, point-sources (PSs) such as MSPs become statistically
degenerate with smooth Poisson emission in the ultra-faint limit (formally
where each source is expected to contribute much less than one photon on
average), leading to an ambiguity that can render questions such as whether the
emission is PS-like or Poissonian in nature ill-defined. We present a
conceptually new approach that describes the PS and Poisson emission in a
unified manner and only afterwards derives constraints on the Poissonian
component from the so obtained results. For the implementation of this
approach, we leverage deep learning techniques, centered around a neural
network-based method for histogram regression that expresses uncertainties in
terms of quantiles. We demonstrate that our method is robust against a number
of systematics that have plagued previous approaches, in particular DM / PS
misattribution. In the $\textit{Fermi}$ data, we find a faint GCE described by
a median source-count distribution (SCD) peaked at a flux of $\sim4 \times

$\sim3 - 4$ expected counts per PS), which would require $N \sim

the constraint $\eta_P \leq 66\%$ for the Poissonian fraction of the GCE flux

galaxies from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Several experiments e.g.
CONCERTO, TIME, CCAT-p are underway to map the CII LIM signal fluctuations from
the EoR, enabling us to estimate the CII power-spectrum and CII$\times$21-cm
cross-power spectrum. Observed LIM signal will have its time evolution embedded
in it along the Line of Sight (LoS) due to the finite travel time of the signal
from its origin to the observer. We have investigated this so-called light-cone
effect on the observed statistics of our semi-numerically simulated CII signal
from the EoR. Using a suit of simulated CII and neutral hydrogen 21-cm maps and
corresponding light-cone boxes, we have shown that the light-cone effect can
impact the CII power spectrum by more than 15% at large scales ($k\sim 0.1\,
\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, at $z=6.8$). We have also observed that the impact of
light-cone effect on the CII power spectrum drops with decreasing redshift
within the redshift range considered here ($7.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$). The
CII$\times$21-cm cross-power spectrum is also affected by light-cone, and in
our models where reionization ends before $z=6$, we find that the maximum
impact on cross-power can reach up to 20%. At $z=6.4$, we find comparatively
pronounced variation in the light-cone effect with reionization history on the
cross power. Faster reionization histories have a more drastic light-cone
effect on cross-power. We conclude that we need to incorporate the light-cone
in order to properly model the signal, constrain the EoR-related astrophysical
parameters and reionization history using the CII$\times$21-cm cross-power
spectrum.

The nature of the phase transitions depends on the excitations being condensed.
Upon condensing dipolar bound states of fractons or lineons, for $N \geq 4$ we
find stable critical points described by decoupled stacks of $d=2$ conformal

gapless phase intermediate between the X-cube and condensed phases, described
as an array of $d=1$ conformal field theories. In all these cases, effective
subsystem symmetries arise from the mobility constraints on the excitations of
the X-cube phase and play an important role in the analysis of the phase
transitions.

represents an immense uncertainty in stellar evolution models.In addition to
extending the main-sequence lifetime, chemical mixing also appreciably
increases the mass of the stellar core. Several studies have made attempts to
calibrate the efficiency of different convective boundary mixing mechanisms,
with sometimes seemingly conflicting results. Aims: We aim to demonstrate that
stellar models regularly under-predict the masses of convective stellar cores.
Methods: We gather convective core mass and fractional core hydrogen content
inferences from numerous independent binary and asteroseismic studies, and
compare them to stellar evolution models computed with the MESA stellar
evolution code. Results: We demonstrate that core mass inferences from the
literature are ubiquitously more massive than predicted by stellar evolution
models without or with little convective boundary mixing. Conclusions:
Independent of the form of internal mixing, stellar models require an efficient
mixing mechanism that produces more massive cores throughout the main sequence
to reproduce high-precision observations. This has implications for the
post-main sequence evolution of all stars which have a well developed
convective core on the main sequence.

beyond the Standard Model. While it is often assumed that perturbations in DR
are adiabatic, they can easily have an isocurvature component if more than one
field was present during inflation, and whose decay products did not all
thermalize with each other. By implementing the appropriate isocurvature
initial conditions (IC), we derive the constraints on both uncorrelated and
correlated DR density isocurvature perturbations from the full Planck 2018 data
alone, and also in combination with other cosmological data sets. Our study on
free-streaming DR (FDR) updates and generalizes the existing bound on neutrino
density isocurvature perturbations by including a varying number of
relativistic degrees of freedom, and for coupled DR (CDR) isocurvature, we
derive the first bound. We also show that for CDR qualitatively new physical
effects arise compared to FDR. One such effect is that for isocurvature IC, FDR
gives rise to larger CMB anisotropies compared to CDR -- contrary to the
adiabatic case. More generally, we find that a blue-tilt of DR isocurvature

distributions of the diffuse dark matter haloes are optimised by comparing the
observed and model-predicted positions of 55 multiple images of 20 background
sources, distributed over the redshift range $0.73-6.11$. We determine the
uncertainties on the model parameters with Monte Carlo Markov chains. Compared
to previous works, our model allows for the inclusion of a scatter on the
relation between the total mass and the velocity dispersion of cluster members,
which also shows a shallower slope. We notice a lower statistical uncertainty
on the value of some parameters, such as the core radius, of the diffuse mass
component of the cluster. Thanks to a new estimate of the stellar mass of all
members, we measure the cumulative projected mass profiles out to a radius of
350 kpc, for all baryonic and dark matter components of the cluster. At the
outermost radius, we find a baryon fraction of $0.147 \pm 0.002$. We compare
the sub-haloes as described by our model with recent hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations. We find good agreement in terms of the stellar over
total mass fraction. On the other hand, we report some discrepancies in terms
of the maximum circular velocity, which is an indication of their compactness,

galactic outflows. These are 3D simulations that replicate star-formation in a
Milky-Way mass galaxy and follow magnetized outflows emerging from the disk. We
detect a plateau-like feature in the observed emission at a height of $2-3$ kpc
from the mid-plane of the galaxy, in qualitative agreement with that expected
from simulations. This feature is believed to be due to the compression of
magnetic fields behind the outer shocks of galactic outflows. We model the
observed surface brightness profiles by assuming an exponential as well as a
Gaussian fitting model. Using $\chi^2$ statistics, we find that the exponential
model fits the profiles better and we use it to determine the scale heights. We
estimate the scale height for the synchrotron radio emission to be $\sim 1$
kpc. The timescales for advection due to outflows and diffusion of cosmic ray
electrons are $\gtrsim 5$ and $\sim 160$ Myr, respectively. Because advection
acts on a timescale much shorter than diffusion, we conclude that in NGC $4631$
advection, rather than diffusion, plays the dominant role in the formation of
radio halo. The spectral index image with regions of flatter radio spectral
index in the halo appears to indicate possible effects of gas outflow from the

the primary sources for the upcoming low frequency ($10^{-4}-10^{-1}$ Hz)
window probed by LISA. It is important to investigate the expected MBH merger
rates and associated signals, to determine how potential LISA events are
affected by physics included in current models. To study this, we post-process
the large population of MBHBs in the Illustris simulation to account for
dynamical friction time delays associated with BH infall/inspiral. We show that
merger delays associated with binary evolution have the potential to decrease
the expected merger rates, with $M_{\rm{BH}} > 10^6 M_\odot$ MBHBs (the lowest
mass in Illustris) decreasing from $\sim 3$ yr$^{-1}$ to $\sim 0.1 $yr$^{-1}$,
and shifting the merger peak from z $\sim 2$ to $\sim 1.25$. During this time,
we estimate that accretion grows the total merging mass by as much as 7x from
the original mass. Importantly, however, dynamical friction associated delays
(which shift the mergers toward lower-redshift and higher-masses) lead to a
stronger signal/strain for the emitted GWs in the LISA band, increasing mean
frequency from $10^{-3.1}$ to $10^{-3.4}-10^{-4.0}$ Hz, and mean strain from
$10^{-17.2}$ to $10^{-16.3}-10^{-15.3}$. Finally, we show that after including
a merger delay and associated $M_{\rm{BH}}$ growth, mergers still tend to lie

semi-major axis of $0.5142\pm0.0042$ au, this candidate's orbit falls between
those of its companions and is located beyond the outer edge of the system's
habitable zone (determined using the moist greenhouse and maximum greenhouse
limits in Kopparapu et al., 2013). It has a minimum mass of $4.1\pm0.6$
$M_\oplus$, giving a radial-velocity amplitude of $0.81\pm0.18$
$\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$. If confirmed, this would be one of the lowest-amplitude
planet detections from any of these four instruments. Our analysis of the joint
radial-velocity data set also provides tighter constraints on the orbital
parameters for the previously known planets. Photometric data from TESS do not
show any signs of a transit event. However, the outermost planet and candidate
are prime targets for future direct imaging missions, and GJ 411 c may be
detectable via astrometry.

a range of fascinating phenomena, that emerge from the interplay of band
topology and interactions. We show that the non-linear second-order
photoresponse is an appealing probe of this rich interplay. A dominant part of
the photoresponse is the shift-current, which is determined by the geometry of
the electronic wavefunctions and carrier properties, and thus becomes strongly
modified by electron-electron interactions. We analyze its dependence on the
twist angle and doping, and investigate the role of interactions. In the
absence of interactions, the response of the system is dictated by two energy
scales: the mean energy of direct transitions between the hole and electron
flat bands, and the gap between flat and dispersive bands. Including
electron-electron interactions, both enhance the response at the
non-interacting characteristic frequencies as well as produce new resonances.
We attribute these changes to the filling-dependent band renormalization in
TBG. Our results highlight the connection between non-trivial geometric
properties of TBG and its optical response, as well as demonstrate how optical
probes can access the role of interactions in moi\'re materials.

method that has been intermittently studied in the past decade. In 1bCS, linear
samples of a high dimensional signal are quantized to only one bit per sample
(sign of the measurement). The extreme quantization makes it an interesting
case study of the more general single-index or generalized linear models. At
the same time it can also be thought of as a `design' version of learning a
binary linear classifier or halfspace-learning.
  Assuming the original signal vector to be sparse, existing results in 1bCS
either aim to find the support of the vector, or approximate the signal within
an $\epsilon$-ball. The focus of this paper is support recovery, which often
also computationally facilitate approximate signal recovery. A \emph{universal}
measurement matrix for 1bCS refers to one set of measurements that work
\emph{for all} sparse signals. With universality, it is known that
$\tilde{\Theta}(k^2)$ 1bCS measurements are necessary and sufficient for
support recovery (where $k$ denotes the sparsity). In this work, we show that
it is possible to universally recover the support with a small number of false
positives with $\tilde{O}(k^{3/2})$ measurements. If the dynamic range of the
signal vector is known, then with a different technique, this result can be
improved to only $\tilde{O}(k)$ measurements. Other results on universal but
approximate support recovery are also provided in this paper. All of our main
recovery algorithms are simple and polynomial-time.

explore the joint analysis of imagery from different sensors in the light of
representation learning: we propose to learn a joint embedding of multiple
satellite sensors within a deep neural network. Our application problem is the
monitoring of lake ice on Alpine lakes. To reach the temporal resolution
requirement of the Swiss Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) office, we
combine three image sources: Sentinel-1 SAR (S1-SAR), Terra MODIS, and
Suomi-NPP VIIRS. The large gaps between the optical and SAR domains and between
the sensor resolutions make this a challenging instance of the sensor fusion
problem. Our approach can be classified as a late fusion that is learned in a
data-driven manner. The proposed network architecture has separate encoding
branches for each image sensor, which feed into a single latent embedding.
I.e., a common feature representation shared by all inputs, such that
subsequent processing steps deliver comparable output irrespective of which
sort of input image was used. By fusing satellite data, we map lake ice at a
temporal resolution of < 1.5 days. The network produces spatially explicit lake
ice maps with pixel-wise accuracies > 91% (respectively, mIoU scores > 60%) and
generalises well across different lakes and winters. Moreover, it sets a new
state-of-the-art for determining the important ice-on and ice-off dates for the
target lakes, in many cases meeting the GCOS requirement.

modeling bidirectional propagation of nonlinear waves in a continuous medium.
In the limit of vanishing nonlocality we study the behavior of solutions to the
Cauchy problem. We prove that, as the kernel functions of the convolution
integral approach the Dirac delta function, the solutions converge strongly to
the corresponding solutions of the classical elasticity equation. An energy
estimate with no loss of derivative plays a critical role in proving the
convergence result. As a typical example, we consider the continuous limit of
the discrete lattice dynamic model (the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou model) and
show that, as the lattice spacing approaches zero, solutions to the discrete
lattice equation converge to the corresponding solutions of the classical
elasticity equation.

originating in the core of the Sun would provide a unique signature of dark
matter annihilation. Since excellent angle and energy reconstruction are
necessary to detect this monoenergetic, directional neutrino flux, DUNE with
its vast volume and reconstruction capabilities, is a promising candidate for a
KDAR neutrino search. In this work, we evaluate the proposed KDAR neutrino
search strategies by realistically modeling both neutrino-nucleus interactions
and the response of DUNE. We find that, although reconstruction of the neutrino
energy and direction is difficult with current techniques in the relevant
energy range, the superb energy resolution, angular resolution, and particle
identification offered by DUNE can still permit great signal/background
discrimination. Moreover, there are non-standard scenarios in which searches at
DUNE for KDAR in the Sun can probe dark matter interactions.

algorithms are known for time series decomposition, none operate well in an
online scalable setting where high throughput and real-time response are
paramount. In this paper, we propose OnlineSTL, a novel online algorithm for
time series decomposition which is highly scalable and is deployed for
real-time metrics monitoring on high-resolution, high-ingest rate data.
Experiments on different synthetic and real world time series datasets
demonstrate that OnlineSTL achieves orders of magnitude speedups (100x) while
maintaining quality of decomposition.

demonstrate that the naturally large difference of the repetition rates at the

the index-matching parameter to exceed the repetition rate difference by a
significant factor. This factor equals the sideband number associated with the
high-order phase-matched sum-frequency process. The theoretical framework,
i.e., the dressed-resonator method, to study the frequency conversion and comb
generation is formulated by including the sum-frequency nonlinearity into the
definition of the resonator spectrum. The Rabi splitting of the dressed
frequencies leads to the four distinct parametric down-conversion conditions
(signal-idler-pump photon energy conservation laws). The parametric instability
tongues associated with the generation of the sparse, i.e.,
Turing-pattern-like, frequency combs with varying repetition rates are analysed
in details. The sum-frequency matched sideband exhibits the optical Pockels

performed, in which each shell-averaged quantity evolved from a value
appropriate to an initial Gaussian state, to fluctuate about a mean value. Once
the transient had passed, mean values (and their associated statistics) were
obtained by sampling the evolved time-series at intervals of the order of an
eddy-turnover time. This was repeated for a range of Taylor-Reynolds numbers
from 10.6 to 335.2. With increasing Reynolds number, our results for energy
spectra, transfer spectra and inertial flux supported the Kolmogorov-Obukhov
picture of turbulent energy transfer. In particular, we observed the onset of
scale-invariance of the inertial flux, accompanied by the onset of the -5/3
power law in the energy spectrum for the corresponding inertial range of
wavenumbers. Detailed comparisons showed that our results were in agreement
with those found in many other investigations. Flow visualization methods were
used to study the internal intermittency. This phenomenon is seen in single
realisations but was found to average out with increasing number of
realisations under ensemble-averaging. Following a critical review of the
literature relating to the controversy about intermittency effects versus
finite-Reynolds number corrections, it was concluded that, for the case of
stationary isotropic turbulence, internal intermittency cannot affect the
Kolmogorov-Obukhov picture, as this is constructed entirely in terms of
ensemble-averaged mean quantities.

represents an efficient strategy to certify quantum nonlocal correlations from

also reduce the photodetector efficiency required to close the detection
loophole. We illustrate our technique by improving the detection of quantum

presented which account for the magnitude dependence of the non-ergodic
effects. In this approach, the average $PSA$ scaling is controlled by an
ergodic $PSA$ GMM, and the non-ergodic effects are captured with non-ergodic
$PSA$ factors, which are the adjustment that needs to be applied to an ergodic
$PSA$ GMM to incorporate the non-ergodic effects. The non-ergodic $PSA$ factors
are based on $EAS$ non-ergodic effects and are converted to $PSA$ through
Random Vibration Theory (RVT). The advantage of this approach is that it better
captures the non-ergodic source, path, and site effects through the small
magnitude earthquakes. Due to the linear properties of Fourier Transform, the
$EAS$ non-ergodic effects of the small events can be applied directly to the
large magnitude events. This is not the case for $PSA$, as response spectrum is
controlled by a range of frequencies, making $PSA$ non-ergodic effects depended
on the spectral shape which is magnitude dependent. Two $PSA$ non-ergodic GMMs
are derived using the ASK14 and CY14 GMMs as backbone models, respectively. The
non-ergodic $EAS$ effects are estimated with the LAK21 GMM. The RVT
calculations are performed with the V75 peak factor model, the $D_{a0.05-0.85}$
estimate of AS96 for the ground-motion duration, and BT15 oscillator-duration
model. The California subset of the NGAWest2 database is used for both models.
The total aleatory standard deviation of the two non-ergodic $PSA$ GMMs is
approximately $30$ to $35\%$ smaller than the total aleatory standard deviation
of the corresponding ergodic $PSA$ GMMs. This reduction has a significant
impact on hazard calculations at large return periods. In remote areas, far
from stations and past events, the reduction of aleatory variability is
accompanied by an increase of epistemic uncertainty.

human perception. Through examining and measuring both the effectiveness of
recent black-box attacks in the face recognition setting and their
corresponding human perceptibility through survey data, we demonstrate the
trade-offs in perceptibility that occur as attacks become more aggressive. We
also show how the $\ell_2$ norm and other metrics do not correlate with human

performance has converged, networks continue to move through parameter space by
a process of anomalous diffusion in which distance travelled grows as a power
law in the number of gradient updates with a nontrivial exponent. We reveal an
intricate interaction between the hyperparameters of optimization, the
structure in the gradient noise, and the Hessian matrix at the end of training
that explains this anomalous diffusion. To build this understanding, we first
derive a continuous-time model for SGD with finite learning rates and batch
sizes as an underdamped Langevin equation. We study this equation in the
setting of linear regression, where we can derive exact, analytic expressions
for the phase space dynamics of the parameters and their instantaneous
velocities from initialization to stationarity. Using the Fokker-Planck
equation, we show that the key ingredient driving these dynamics is not the
original training loss, but rather the combination of a modified loss, which
implicitly regularizes the velocity, and probability currents, which cause
oscillations in phase space. We identify qualitative and quantitative
predictions of this theory in the dynamics of a ResNet-18 model trained on
ImageNet. Through the lens of statistical physics, we uncover a mechanistic
origin for the anomalous limiting dynamics of deep neural networks trained with

traditional phased arrays power combine incoming signals prior to digitization,
orthogonal code-modulation is applied to each incoming signal using phase
shifters within each front-end. These code-modulated signals can then be
combined and processed coherently through a shared hardware path. Visibility
functions can be recovered through squaring and code-demultiplexing operations.
The proposed system modulates incoming signals but demodulates desired
correlations. Firstly, we present the operation of the system, a validation of
its operation using behavioral models of a traditional phased array and a
benchmarking of the code-modulated interferometer against traditional
interferometer using simulation results and sensitivity analysis. Secondly, we
present a simple CMI system operating in the license-free 60-GHz band using a

obtain a 13-pixel image and the system is demonstrated through a point-source

  Learning: a Neural Tangent Kernel Based Approach",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a constrained policy gradient algorithm. We introduce
constraints for safe learning with the following steps. First, learning is
slowed down (lazy learning) so that the episodic policy change can be computed
with the help of the policy gradient theorem and the neural tangent kernel.
Then, this enables us the evaluation of the policy at arbitrary states too. In
the same spirit, learning can be guided, ensuring safety via augmenting episode
batches with states where the desired action probabilities are prescribed.
Finally, exogenous discounted sum of future rewards (returns) can be computed
at these specific state-action pairs such that the policy network satisfies
constraints. Computing the returns is based on solving a system of linear
equations (equality constraints) or a constrained quadratic program (inequality
constraints, regional constraints). Simulation results suggest that adding
constraints (external information) to the learning can improve learning in
terms of speed and transparency reasonably if constraints are appropriately
selected. The efficiency of the constrained learning was demonstrated with a
shallow and wide ReLU network in the Cartpole and Lunar Lander OpenAI gym
environments. The main novelty of the paper is giving a practical use of the

Sloan Digital Sky Survey, as measured in the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey
(LoTSS). We present a model of the radio luminosity distribution of the quasars
that assumes that every quasar displays a superposition of two sources of radio
emission: active galactic nuclei (jets) and star-formation. Our two-component
model provides an excellent match to the observed radio flux density
distributions across a wide range of redshifts and quasar optical luminosities;
this suggests that the jet-launching mechanism operates in all quasars but with
different powering efficiency. The wide distribution of jet powers allows for a
smooth transition between the 'radio-quiet' and 'radio-loud' quasar regimes,
without need for any explicit bimodality. The best-fit model parameters
indicate that the star-formation rate of quasar host galaxies correlates
strongly with quasar luminosity and also increases with redshift at least out
to z~2. For a model where star-formation rate scales as $SFR \propto
L_{bol}^\alpha (1+z)^\beta$, we find $\alpha = 0.47 \pm 0.01$ and $\beta = 1.61
\pm 0.05$, in agreement with far-infrared studies. Quasars contribute ~0.15 per
cent of the cosmic star-formation rate density at z=0.5, rising to 0.4 per cent
by z=2. The typical radio jet power is seen to increase with both increasing
optical luminosity and black hole mass independently, but does not vary with
redshift, suggesting intrinsic properties govern the production of the radio
jets. We discuss the implications of these results for the triggering of quasar
activity and the launching of jets.

computational efficiency. Here, we propose adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD),
a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a

network in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet
transform. The resulting model is highly predictive, concise, computationally
efficient, and has properties (such as a multi-scale structure) which make it
easy to interpret. In close collaboration with domain experts, we showcase how
AWD addresses challenges in two real-world settings: cosmological parameter

scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive
performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks. Moreover, AWD

locations of change points in a high-dimensional mean shift model. To that end,
we develop a locally refitted least squares estimator and obtain component-wise
and simultaneous rates of estimation of the underlying change points. The
simultaneous rate is the sharpest available in the literature by at least a
factor of $\log p,$ while the component-wise one is optimal. These results
enable existence of limiting distributions. Component-wise distributions are
characterized under both vanishing and non-vanishing jump size regimes, while
joint distributions for any finite subset of change point estimates are
characterized under the latter regime, which also yields asymptotic
independence of these estimates. The combined results are used to construct
asymptotically valid component-wise and simultaneous confidence intervals for
the change point parameters. The results are established under a high
dimensional scaling, allowing for diminishing jump sizes, in the presence of
diverging number of change points and under subexponential errors. They are

for $ S_{k}(G) $ for some classes of graphs and use them to verify Brouwer's

Laplacian energy conjecture for trees. We prove the Laplacian energy conjecture
completely for trees of diameter $ 4 $. Further, we prove this conjecture for

consequences of joined union, we obtain the normalized Laplacian spectrum of
power graphs associated to finite cyclic groups.
  In Chapter $5$, we find the distance signless Laplacian spectrum of regular

find the bounds for spectral radius of generalized distance matrix. Further, we
obtain the generalized distance energy for bipartite graphs and trees. We prove
that the complete bipartite graph has minimum generalized distance energy among

machine learning (ML) research, with researchers (i) examining the benefits of
diversity as an organizational solution for alleviating problems with
algorithmic bias, and (ii) proposing measures and methods for implementing
diversity as a design desideratum in the construction of predictive algorithms.
Currently, however, there is a gap between discussions of measures and benefits
of diversity in ML, on the one hand, and the broader research on the underlying
concepts of diversity and the precise mechanisms of its functional benefits, on
the other. This gap is problematic because diversity is not a monolithic
concept. Rather, different concepts of diversity are based on distinct
rationales that should inform how we measure diversity in a given context.
Similarly, the lack of specificity about the precise mechanisms underpinning
diversity's potential benefits can result in uninformative generalities,
invalid experimental designs, and illicit interpretations of findings. In this
work, we draw on research in philosophy, psychology, and social and
organizational sciences to make three contributions: First, we introduce a
taxonomy of different diversity concepts from philosophy of science, and
explicate the distinct epistemic and political rationales underlying these
concepts. Second, we provide an overview of mechanisms by which diversity can
benefit group performance. Third, we situate these taxonomies--of concepts and
mechanisms--in the lifecycle of sociotechnical ML systems and make a case for
their usefulness in fair and accountable ML. We do so by illustrating how they
clarify the discourse around diversity in the context of ML systems, promote
the formulation of more precise research questions about diversity's impact,

logarithmic height $O(\log^3(dH))$ that converges at a rate of
$O\!\left((1/p)^{2^i}\right)$ after $i$ steps of Newton iteration. We also
prove significant speed-ups in certain settings, a minimal spacing bound of
$p^{-O(p\log^2_p(dH)\log d)}$ for distinct roots in $\mathbb{C}_p$, and even
stronger repulsion when there are nonzero degenerate roots in $\mathbb{C}_p$:
$p$-adic distance $p^{-O(\log_p(dH))}$. On the other hand, we prove that there

low complexity of a classical 2D convolution; ii) adapt standard CNN techniques
such as stride, iterative aggregation, and pixel shuffling to the spherical

compared to learning models based on graph convolutional networks, our solution
supports more expressive filters that can preserve high frequencies and provide
a better perceptual quality of the compressed images. Such results demonstrate

massive stars. A significant number of binary stars are not in strict
synchronous rotation, including all eccentric systems. This leads to a tidally
induced and time-variable differential rotation structure. We present a method
for exploring the rotation structure of asynchronously rotating binaries. We
solve the equations of motion of a 3D grid of volume elements located above the
rigidly rotating core in the presence of gravitational, centrifugal, Coriolis,
gas pressure and viscous forces to obtain the angular velocity as a function of
the three spatial coordinates and time. We find that the induced rotation
structure and its temporal variability depend on the degree of departure from
synchronicity. In eccentric systems, the structure changes over the orbital
cycle with maximum amplitudes occurring potentially at orbital phases other
than periastron passage. We discuss the possible role of the time-dependent
tidal flows in enhancing the mixing efficiency and speculate that, in this
context, slowly rotating asynchronous binaries could have more efficient mixing
than the analogous more rapidly rotating but tidally locked systems. We find
that some observed nitrogen abundances depend on the orbital inclination,
which, if real, would imply an inhomogeneous chemical distribution over the
stellar surface or that tidally induced spectral line variability, which is
strongest near the equator, affects the abundance determinations. Our models
predict that, neglecting other angular momentum transfer mechanisms, a
pronounced initial differential rotation structure converges toward average
uniform rotation on the viscous timescale. We suggest that by taking into
account the processes that are triggered by asynchronous rotation, a broader
perspective of binary star structure, evolution and variability may be gleaned.

Cayley's trick, standard flips, projectivizations, and Grassmannain-flips --
and supplement these formulae with the results on mutations and relative Serre
functors. This framework also leads us to many new phenomena such as virtual
flips, and structural results for the derived categories of (i)
$\mathrm{Quot}_2$ schemes, (ii) flips from partial desingularizations of
$\mathrm{rank}\le 2$ degeneracy loci, and (iii) blowups along determinantal
subschemes of codimension $\le 4$.

  regression","Published in NeurIPS 2021",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Models like LASSO and ridge regression are extensively used in practice due
to their interpretability, ease of use, and strong theoretical guarantees.
Cross-validation (CV) is widely used for hyperparameter tuning in these models,
but do practical optimization methods minimize the true out-of-sample loss? A
recent line of research promises to show that the optimum of the CV loss
matches the optimum of the out-of-sample loss (possibly after simple
corrections). It remains to show how tractable it is to minimize the CV loss.
In the present paper, we show that, in the case of ridge regression, the CV
loss may fail to be quasiconvex and thus may have multiple local optima. We can
guarantee that the CV loss is quasiconvex in at least one case: when the
spectrum of the covariate matrix is nearly flat and the noise in the observed
responses is not too high. More generally, we show that quasiconvexity status
is independent of many properties of the observed data (response norm,
covariate-matrix right singular vectors and singular-value scaling) and has a
complex dependence on the few that remain. We empirically confirm our theory
using simulated experiments.

ship waves taken from a sensor fixed at a single point in space. Recent work
based on a simplified model for the ship's disturbance suggests that matching
the spectrogram heat-map patterns to a so-called dispersion curve has the
potential for estimating of properties of a steadily moving ship, such as the
ship's speed and closest distance to the sensor. Here we extend the theory
behind the dispersion curve so that it can be applied to ships accelerating
along arbitrary paths and demonstrate how acceleration affects the structure of
the associated spectrograms. Examples are provided for of a simple model of a
ship accelerating/decelerating in a straight line or travelling in a circle
with constant angular speed. We highlight a problem with non-uniqueness of the
dispersion curve when comparing ships moving along different paths. Finally, we
validate the new dispersion curve against experimental results of ship models
accelerating in a finite depth basin. Our work will provide a basis for more
comprehensive studies that extend the simplified model to take into account the
shape of the hull in question.

significantly suppresses leakage-induced bit-flip errors (which we show are a

chips into an electronic system can severely affect security and reliability
domains because of their sub-standard quality, poor performance, and shorter

systems. However, a single solution to prevent counterfeiting is challenging
due to the diversity of counterfeit types, sources, and refinement techniques.
Besides, the chips can pass initial testing and still fail while being used in

framework that detects major counterfeit static random-access memory (SRAM)

often changes with time due to link failures or topology variations, creating a
mismatch between the graphs on which GNNs were trained and the ones on which

time to overcome this issue. However, most online algorithms are centralized
and usually offer guarantees only on convex problems, which GNNs rarely lead
to. This paper develops the Wide and Deep GNN (WD-GNN), a novel architecture
that can be updated with distributed online learning mechanisms. The WD-GNN
consists of two components: the wide part is a linear graph filter and the deep
part is a nonlinear GNN. At training time, the joint wide and deep architecture
learns nonlinear representations from data. At testing time, the wide, linear
part is retrained, while the deep, nonlinear one remains fixed. This often
leads to a convex formulation. We further propose a distributed online learning

across all industries, such as disease diagnosis in healthcare or quality
assurance in manufacturing. Manual inspection of images, when extended over a
monotonously repetitive period of time is very time consuming and can lead to
anomalies being overlooked.Artificial neural networks have proven themselves
very successful on simple, repetitive tasks, in some cases even outperforming
humans. Therefore, in this paper we investigate different methods of deep
learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, for anomaly detection
applied to a quality assurance use case. We utilize the MVTec anomaly dataset
and develop three different models, a CNN for supervised anomaly detection,
KD-CAE for autoencoder anomaly detection, NI-CAE for noise induced anomaly
detection and a DCGAN for generating reconstructed images. By experiments, we
found that KD-CAE performs better on the anomaly datasets compared to CNN and
NI-CAE, with NI-CAE performing the best on the Transistor dataset. We also
implemented a DCGAN for the creation of new training data but due to
computational limitation and lack of extrapolating the mechanics of AnoGAN, we
restricted ourselves just to the generation of GAN based images. We conclude
that unsupervised methods are more powerful for anomaly detection in images,
especially in a setting where only a small amount of anomalous data is
available, or the data is unlabeled.

  Overall, we show 3SUM-hardness of (a) detecting an Abelian square factor of
an odd half-length, (b) computing centers of all Abelian square factors, (c)
detecting an additive square factor in a length-$n$ string of integers of

  Problem (d) is essentially a convolution version of the AVERAGE problem that
was proposed in a manuscript of Erickson. We obtain a conditional lower bound
for it with the aid of techniques recently developed by Dudek et al. [STOC

reductions to problems (a) and (b). In conditional lower bounds for problems
(a) and (b) we apply an encoding of Amir et al. [ICALP 2014] and extend it
using several string gadgets that include arbitrarily long Abelian-square-free
strings.
  Our reductions also imply conditional lower bounds for detecting Abelian
squares in strings over a constant-sized alphabet. We also show a subquadratic
upper bound in this case, applying a result of Chan and Lewenstein [STOC 2015].

Supra-arcade Downflows (SADs) are plasma voids that first come out above the

phase of the flare. In our work, we study 20 SADs appearing in three flares. By
differential emission measure (DEM) analysis, we calculate the DEM weighted
average temperature and emission measure (EM) of the front region and the main
body of SADs. It is found that the temperatures of the SAD front and body tend
to increase during the course of SADs flowing downwards. The relationship
between the pressure and temperature fits well with the adiabatic equation for
both the SAD front and body, suggesting that the heating of SADs is mainly
caused by adiabatic compression. Moreover, we also estimate the velocities of
SADs via the Fourier Local Correlation Tracking (FLCT) method and find that
increase of the temperature of the SAD front presents a correlation with the
decrease of the SAD kinetic energy, while the SAD body does not, implying that
the viscous process may also heat the SAD front in spite of a limited role.

optimal transports that correspond to geodesics in the space of distributions

conditional Wasserstein barycenters constructed for a geodesic in the Euclidean

dysfunction of the heart associated with complex spatiotemporal dynamics of

been hypothesized that VF is driven by three-dimensional (3D) rotating
electrical scroll waves, which can be characterized by filament-like electrical
phase singularities (EPS). Recently, it was shown that rotating excitation
waves during VF are associated with rotating waves of mechanical deformation.
3D mechanical scroll waves and mechanical filaments describing their rotational
core were observed in the ventricles by using high-resolution ultrasound. The
findings suggest that the spatiotemporal organization of cardiac fibrillation
may be assessed from waves of mechanical deformation. However, the complex
relationship between excitation and mechanical waves during VF is currently not
understood. Here, we study the fundamental nature of mechanical phase
singularities (MPS), their spatiotemporal organization and relation with EPS.
We demonstrate the existence of two fundamental types of MPS: ""paired
singularities"", which are co-localized with EPS, and ""unpaired singularities"",
which can form independently. We show that the unpaired singularities emerge
due to the anisotropy of the active force field, generated by fiber anisotropy
in cardiac tissue, and the non-locality of elastic interactions, which jointly
induce strong spatiotemporal inhomogeneities in the strain fields. The
inhomogeneities lead to the breakup of deformation waves and create MPS, even
in the absence of EPS, which are typically associated with excitation wave
break. We exploit these insights to develop an approach to discriminate paired
and unpaired MPS. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the
complex spatiotemporal organization of electromechanical waves in the heart.

epitaxial grown LT-GaAs/Si sample, compared to a reference grown under the same

and some crystal misorientation are present in the LT-GaAs/Si. From coherent
phonon spectroscopy, the intrinsic carrier densities are estimated to be
~$10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ for either sample. Strong plasmon damping is also
observed. Carrier dynamics, measured by time-resolved THz spectroscopy at high
excitation fluence, reveals markedly different responses between samples. Below
saturation, both samples exhibit the desired fast response. Under optical
fluences $\geq$ 54 $\mu$ J/cm$^2$, the reference LT-GaAs layer shows saturation
of electron trapping states leading to non-exponential behavior, but the

scenarios; however, it is difficult for human and algorithms to perceive the
real scene in the colorless NIR domain. While Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) has been widely employed in various image colorization tasks, it is
challenging for a direct mapping mechanism, such as a conventional GAN, to
transform an image from the NIR to the RGB domain with correct semantic
reasoning, well-preserved textures, and vivid color combinations concurrently.
In this work, we propose a novel Attention-based NIR image colorization
framework via Adaptive Fusion of Semantic and Texture clues, aiming at
achieving these goals within the same framework. The tasks of texture transfer
and semantic reasoning are carried out in two separate network blocks.
Specifically, the Texture Transfer Block (TTB) aims at extracting texture
features from the NIR image's Laplacian component and transferring them for
subsequent color fusion. The Semantic Reasoning Block (SRB) extracts semantic
clues and maps the NIR pixel values to the RGB domain. Finally, a Fusion
Attention Block (FAB) is proposed to adaptively fuse the features from the two
branches and generate an optimized colorization result. In order to enhance the
network's learning capacity in semantic reasoning as well as mapping precision
in texture transfer, we have proposed the Residual Coordinate Attention Block
(RCAB), which incorporates coordinate attention into a residual learning
framework, enabling the network to capture long-range dependencies along the
channel direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved
along spatial directions. RCAB is also incorporated into FAB to facilitate
accurate texture alignment during fusion. Both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art NIR
image colorization methods.

  with Unimodality Information",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Probabilistic methods have attracted much interest in fault detection design,
but its need for complete distributional knowledge is seldomly fulfilled. This
has spurred endeavors in distributionally robust fault detection (DRFD) design,
which secures robustness against inexact distributions by using moment-based
ambiguity sets as a prime modelling tool. However, with the worst-case
distribution being implausibly discrete, the resulting design suffers from
over-pessimisim and can mask the true fault. This paper aims at developing a
new DRFD design scheme with reduced conservatism, by assuming unimodality of
the true distribution, a property commonly encountered in real-life practice.
To tackle the chance constraint on false alarms, we first attain a new
generalized Gauss bound on the probability outside an ellipsoid, which is less
conservative than known Chebyshev bounds. As a result, analytical solutions to
DRFD design problems are obtained, which are less conservative than known ones
disregarding unimodality. We further encode bounded support information into
ambiguity sets, derive a tightened multivariate Gauss bound, and develop
approximate reformulations of design problems as convex programs. Moreover, the
derived generalized Gauss bounds are broadly applicable to versatile change
detection tasks for setting alarm thresholds. Results on a laborotary system
shown that, the incorporation of unimodality information helps reducing
conservatism of distributionally robust design and leads to a better tradeoff
between robustness and sensitivity.

buyer with a strict budget constraint seeks to acquire services from a group of
strategic providers (the sellers). During the last decade, several
strategyproof budget-feasible procurement auctions have been proposed, aiming
to maximize the value of the buyer, while eliciting each seller's true cost for
providing their service. These solutions predominantly take the form of
randomized sealed-bid auctions: they ask the sellers to report their private
costs and then use randomization to determine which subset of services will be
procured and how much each of the chosen providers will be paid, ensuring that
the total payment does not exceed budget. Our main result in this paper is a
novel method for designing budget-feasible auctions, leading to solutions that
outperform the previously proposed auctions in multiple ways.
  First, our solutions take the form of descending clock auctions, and thus
satisfy a list of properties, such as obvious strategyproofness, group
strategyproofness, transparency, and unconditional winner privacy; this makes
these auctions much more likely to be used in practice. Second, in contrast to
previous results that heavily depend on randomization, our auctions are
deterministic. As a result, we provide an affirmative answer to one of the main
open questions in this literature, asking whether a deterministic strategyproof
auction can achieve a constant approximation when the buyer's valuation
function is submodular over the set of services. In addition, we also provide
the first deterministic budget-feasible auction that matches the approximation
bound of the best-known randomized auction for the class of subadditive
valuations. Finally, using our method, we improve the best-known approximation
factor for monotone submodular valuations, which has been the focus of most of

opportunity to overcome this restriction. This paper therefore introduces
S2Looking, a building-change-detection dataset that contains large-scale

train deep-learning-based change-detection algorithms. It expands upon existing
datasets by providing (1) larger viewing angles; (2) large illumination
variances; and (3) the added complexity of rural images. To facilitate {the}

rather than storage error correction. In this paper, we use these codes for
storage error correction with surprising results. We find that adapting residue
codes to modern memory systems offers a level of error correction comparable to
traditional schemes such as Reed-Solomon with fewer bits of storage. For
instance, our adaptation of residue code -- MUSE ECC -- can offer ChipKill
protection using approximately 30% fewer bits. We show that the storage gains
can be used to hold metadata needed for emerging security functionality such as
memory tagging or to provide better detection capabilities against Rowhammer
attacks. Our evaluation shows that memory tagging in a MUSE-enabled system
shows a 12% reduction in memory bandwidth utilization while providing the same
level of error correction as a traditional ECC baseline without a noticeable
loss of performance. Thus, our work demonstrates a new, flexible primitive for
co-designing reliability with security and performance.

models from long-tailed data, generally assume the models would be evaluated on
the uniform test class distribution. However, practical test class
distributions often violate this assumption (e.g., being either long-tailed or
even inversely long-tailed), which may lead existing methods to fail in real
applications. In this paper, we study a more practical yet challenging task,
called test-agnostic long-tailed recognition, where the training class
distribution is long-tailed while the test class distribution is agnostic and
not necessarily uniform. In addition to the issue of class imbalance, this task
poses another challenge: the class distribution shift between the training and
test data is unknown. To tackle this task, we propose a novel approach, called
Self-supervised Aggregation of Diverse Experts, which consists of two
strategies: (i) a new skill-diverse expert learning strategy that trains
multiple experts from a single and stationary long-tailed dataset to separately
handle different class distributions; (ii) a novel test-time expert aggregation
strategy that leverages self-supervision to aggregate the learned multiple
experts for handling unknown test class distributions. We theoretically show
that our self-supervised strategy has a provable ability to simulate
test-agnostic class distributions. Promising empirical results demonstrate the

This, coupled with a usually low budget, restricts small satellites from using
high precision sensors for its especially important task of attitude
estimation. On top of this, small satellites, on account of their size and
weight, are comparatively more sensitive to environmental or orbital
disturbances as compared to their larger counterparts. Magnetic disturbance
forms the major contributor to orbital disturbances on small satellites in

be determined in real-time. This paper presents a method for in-orbit

to circumnavigate the inaccuracy arising due to unknown orbital magnetic

requirement for observing quantum causality. We first show that previous
classical causal inequalities require detection efficiency at least 95.97%
(89.44%) to show violation with quantum (nonsignaling) correlations. Next we
derive a classical causal inequality I_{222} and show that it requires lower
detection efficiency to be violated, 92.39% for quantum correlations and 81.65%
for nonsignaling correlations, hence substantially reducing the requirement on
detection. Then we extend this causal inequality to the case of multiple
measurement settings and analyze the corresponding detection efficiency. After
that, we show that previous quantum causal inequalities require detection
efficiency at least 94.29% to violate with nonsignaling correlations. We
subsequently derive a quantum causal bound J_{222} that has a lower detection
efficiency requirement of 91.02% for violation with nonsignaling correlations.

  SLAM",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Building object-level maps can facilitate robot-environment interactions
(e.g. planning and manipulation), but objects could often have multiple
probable poses when viewed from a single vantage point, due to symmetry,
occlusion or perceptual failures. A robust object-level simultaneous
localization and mapping (object SLAM) algorithm needs to be aware of this pose
ambiguity. We propose to maintain and subsequently disambiguate the multiple
pose interpretations to gradually recover a globally consistent world
representation. The max-mixtures model is applied to implicitly and efficiently
track all pose hypotheses, but the resulting formulation is non-convex, and
therefore subject to local optima. To mitigate this problem, temporally
consistent hypotheses are extracted, guiding the optimization into the global
optimum. This consensus-informed inference method is applied online via
landmark variable re-initialization within an incremental SLAM framework,
iSAM2, for robust real-time performance. We demonstrate that this approach
improves SLAM performance on both simulated and real object SLAM problems with
pose ambiguity.

infinity. The frequency-dependent transmission rates, which deform the thermal
radiation emitted in the vicinity of the black hole horizon, are evaluated
numerically. Apart from the case of four-dimensional spacetime, the
calculations are extended to higher dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""om metrics,
and the results are found to be somewhat sensitive to the spacetime dimension.
In general, it is observed that the transmission coefficients practically
vanishes when the frequency of the emitted particle approaches zero. It
increases with increasing frequency and eventually saturates to some value. For
four-dimensional spacetime, the above result is shown to be mostly independent
of the metric's parameter, neither of the orbital quantum number of the
particle, once the location of the event horizon, $r_h$, and the product of the
charges of the black hole and the particle $qQ$ are given. For
higher-dimensional cases, on the other hand, the convergence becomes more
slowly. Moreover, the difference between states with different orbital quantum
numbers is found to be more significant. As the magnitude of the product of
charges $qQ$ becomes more significant, the transmission coefficient exceeds
one. In other words, the resultant spectral flux is amplified, which results in
an accelerated process of black hole evaporation. The relation between the
calculated outgoing transmission coefficient with existing results on the
greybody factor is discussed.

LQR based approach, which provide large degrees of freedom for enlarging the

proposed approaches provide a linear controller and two additive matrices as
tuning parameters for shaping of the terminal region. Proposed approaches
involve solving modified Lyapunov equations to compute terminal penalty term,
followed by explicit characterization of the terminal region. Efficacy of the
proposed approaches is demonstrated using benchmark two state system. Terminal

  Classification",,,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis focuses on dealing with the task of acoustic scene classification
(ASC), and then applied the techniques developed for ASC to a real-life
application of detecting respiratory disease. To deal with ASC challenges, this
thesis addresses three main factors that directly affect the performance of an
ASC system. Firstly, this thesis explores input features by making use of
multiple spectrograms (log-mel, Gamma, and CQT) for low-level feature
extraction to tackle the issue of insufficiently discriminative or descriptive
input features. Next, a novel Encoder network architecture is introduced. The
Encoder firstly transforms each low-level spectrogram into high-level
intermediate features, or embeddings, and thus combines these high-level
features to form a very distinct composite feature. The composite or combined
feature is then explored in terms of classification performance, with different
Decoders such as Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perception (MLP), and Mixture
of Experts (MoE). By using this Encoder-Decoder framework, it helps to reduce
the computation cost of the reference process in ASC systems which make use of
multiple spectrogram inputs. Since the proposed techniques applied for general
ASC tasks were shown to be highly effective, this inspired an application to a
specific real-life application. This was namely the 2017 Internal Conference on
Biomedical Health Informatics (ICBHI) respiratory sound dataset. Building upon
the proposed ASC framework, the ICBHI tasks were tackled with a deep learning
framework, and the resulting system shown to be capable at detecting
respiratory anomaly cycles and diseases.

especially when faces are partially occluded. To improve the robustness against
occlusion, augmenting the training images with artificial occlusions has been
proved as a useful approach. However, these artificial occlusions are commonly
generated by adding a black rectangle or several object templates including
sunglasses, scarfs and phones, which cannot well simulate the realistic
occlusions. In this paper, based on the argument that the occlusion essentially
damages a group of neurons, we propose a novel and elegant occlusion-simulation
method via dropping the activations of a group of neurons in some elaborately
selected channel. Specifically, we first employ a spatial regularization to
encourage each feature channel to respond to local and different face regions.
In this way, the activations affected by an occlusion in a local region are
more likely to be located in a single feature channel. Then, the locality-aware
channel-wise dropout (LCD) is designed to simulate the occlusion by dropping
out the entire feature channel. Furthermore, by randomly dropping out several
feature channels, our method can well simulate the occlusion of larger area.
The proposed LCD can encourage its succeeding layers to minimize the
intra-class feature variance caused by occlusions, thus leading to improved
robustness against occlusion. In addition, we design an auxiliary spatial
attention module by learning a channel-wise attention vector to reweight the
feature channels, which improves the contributions of non-occluded regions.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable improvement.

distributed programs and hardware by automatically deriving correct
implementations from formal specifications. For synchronous distributed
systems, the synthesis problem is well known to be undecidable. For
asynchronous systems, the boundary between decidable and undecidable synthesis
problems is a long-standing open question. We study the problem in the setting
of Petri games, a framework for distributed systems where asynchronous
processes are equipped with causal memory. Petri games extend Petri nets with a
distinction between system places and environment places. The components of a
distributed system are the players of the game, represented as tokens that
exchange information during each synchronization. Previous decidability results
for this model are limited to local winning conditions, i.e., conditions that
only refer to individual components. In this paper, we consider global winning
conditions such as mutual exclusion, i.e., conditions that refer to the state
of all components. We provide decidability and undecidability results for
global winning conditions. First, we prove for winning conditions given as bad
markings that it is decidable whether a winning strategy for the system players
exists in Petri games with a bounded number of system players and one
environment player. Second, we prove for winning conditions that refer to both
good and bad markings that it is undecidable whether a winning strategy for the

possible to use global safety specifications like mutual exclusion in the

natural language is the most effective mode of interaction with humans, these
exchanges are rarely used as an opportunity for learning. Leveraging language
interactions effectively requires addressing limitations in the two most common
approaches to language grounding: semantic parsers built on top of fixed object
categories are precise but inflexible and end-to-end models are maximally
expressive, but fickle and opaque. Our goal is to develop a system that
balances the strengths of each approach so that users can teach agents new
instructions that generalize broadly from a single example. We introduce the
idea of neural abstructions: a set of constraints on the inference procedure of
a label-conditioned generative model that can affect the meaning of the label
in context. Starting from a core programming language that operates over
abstructions, users can define increasingly complex mappings from natural
language to actions. We show that with this method a user population is able to
build a semantic parser for an open-ended house modification task in Minecraft.
The semantic parser that results is both flexible and expressive: the
percentage of utterances sourced from redefinitions increases steadily over the
course of 191 total exchanges, achieving a final value of 28%.

achieved impressive results. However, due to the nature of model design, an
exemplar-based model usually requires vast amounts of data to participate in
training, which leads to huge computational complexity. To address this issue,
we propose Bayesian Pseudocoresets Exemplar VAE (ByPE-VAE), a new variant of
VAE with a prior based on Bayesian pseudocoreset. The proposed prior is
conditioned on a small-scale pseudocoreset rather than the whole dataset for
reducing the computational cost and avoiding overfitting. Simultaneously, we
obtain the optimal pseudocoreset via a stochastic optimization algorithm during
VAE training aiming to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
prior based on the pseudocoreset and that based on the whole dataset.
Experimental results show that ByPE-VAE can achieve competitive improvements
over the state-of-the-art VAEs in the tasks of density estimation,
representation learning, and generative data augmentation. Particularly, on a
basic VAE architecture, ByPE-VAE is up to 3 times faster than Exemplar VAE

crucial for downstream medical prediction tasks in health informatics. Many NLP

they lack either general or task-specific data. Hence, some recent works train
healthcare representations by incorporating medical ontology, by
self-supervised tasks like diagnosis prediction, but (1) the small-scale,
monotonous ontology is insufficient for robust learning, and (2) critical
contexts or dependencies underlying patient journeys are barely exploited to
enhance ontology learning. To address the challenges, we propose a
Transformer-based representation learning approach: Mutual Integration of
Patient journey and medical Ontology (MIPO), which is a robust end-to-end
framework. Specifically, the proposed method focuses on task-specific
representation learning by a sequential diagnoses predictive task, which is
also beneficial to the ontology-based disease typing task. To integrate
information in the patient's visiting records, we further introduce a
graph-embedding module, which can mitigate the challenge of data insufficiency
in healthcare. In this way, MIPO creates a mutual integration to benefit both
healthcare representation learning and medical ontology embedding. Such an
effective integration is guaranteed by joint training over fused embeddings of
the two modules, targeting both task-specific prediction and ontology-based
disease typing tasks simultaneously. Extensive experiments conducted on two
real-world benchmark datasets have shown MIPO consistently achieves better
performance than state-of-the-art methods no matter whether the training data

key challenges: (i) producing natural head motions that match speech prosody,
and (ii) maintaining the appearance of a speaker in a large head motion while
stabilizing the non-face regions. We first design a head pose predictor by
modeling rigid 6D head movements with a motion-aware recurrent neural network
(RNN). In this way, the predicted head poses act as the low-frequency holistic
movements of a talking head, thus allowing our latter network to focus on
detailed facial movement generation. To depict the entire image motions arising
from audio, we exploit a keypoint based dense motion field representation.
Then, we develop a motion field generator to produce the dense motion fields
from input audio, head poses, and a reference image. As this keypoint based
representation models the motions of facial regions, head, and backgrounds
integrally, our method can better constrain the spatial and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. Finally, an image generation network is
employed to render photo-realistic talking-head videos from the estimated
keypoint based motion fields and the input reference image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method produces videos with plausible head
motions, synchronized facial expressions, and stable backgrounds and
outperforms the state-of-the-art.

magnetic field from a ""perfect"" condition of level anti-crossing increases the
frequency of polarization transfer that can be exploited for polarization of
short-lived transient SABRE complexes i.e. some substrates. Moreover, the
coherences responsible for polarization transfer at a lower field persisted
during magnetic field variation and continued their spin evolution at higher

consideration for an efficient alt-SABRE.

electric conductivity and spin magnetic susceptibility. A tight-binding (TB)
model with real and imaginary transfer energies is derived using
first-principles density-functional theory method. The conductivity without the
SOC depends on both anisotropies of the velocity of the Dirac cone and the
tiling of the cone. Such conductivity is suppressed by the SOC, which gives
rise to the imaginary part of the transfer energy. Due to the SOC, we find at
low temperatures that the reduction of the conductivity becomes large and that
the anisotropy of the conductivity is reduced. A nearly constant conductivity
at high temperatures is obtained by an electron--phonon (e--p) scattering.
Further, the property of the Dirac cone is examined for the spin
susceptibility, which is mainly determined by the density of states (DOS). The
result is compared with the case of the organic conductor

objective of the copter is to actively explore the environment and reduce its
uncertainties, aiming at assisting the rover and enhancing the efficiency of
the mission completion. To formalize our approach, we first capture the
environmental uncertainties by environmental beliefs of the atomic
propositions, under an assumption that it is unknown which properties (or,
atomic propositions) are satisfied in each area of the environment. The
environmental beliefs of the atomic propositions are updated according to the
Bayes rule based on the Bernoulli-type sensor measurements provided by both the
rover and the copter. Then, the optimal policy for the rover is synthesized by
maximizing a belief of the satisfaction of the scLTL formula through an
implementation of an automata-based model checking. An exploration policy for
the copter is then synthesized by employing the notion of an entropy that is
evaluated based on the environmental beliefs of the atomic propositions, and a
path that the rover intends to follow according to the optimal policy. As such,
the copter can actively explore regions whose uncertainties are high and that
are relevant to the mission completion. Finally, some numerical examples
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

is implemented by decomposing the training objective into local intermediate

be less sensitive with the quirks during optimization which could result in a
better local optimum. Experiments on both image and text datasets show that our

two types of injection methods that produce anisotropic or isotropic tangles.
The injected vortex rings develop into a localized vortex tangle consisting of
vortex rings of various sizes through reconnections (fusions and splitting of

increasing number of deeply embedded protostellar systems. It generally shows a
sharp transition going from the protostellar envelope to the disk scale, with
the polarization fraction typically dropping from ${\sim} 5\%$ to ${\sim} 1\%$
and the inferred magnetic field orientations becoming more aligned with the
major axis of the system. We quantitatively investigate these observational
trends using a sample of protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud and compare
these features with a non-ideal MHD disk formation simulation. We find that the
gas density increases faster than the magnetic field strength in the transition
from the envelope to the disk scale, which makes it more difficult to
magnetically align the grains on the disk scale. Specifically, to produce the
observed ${\sim} 1\%$ polarization at ${\sim} 100\,\mathrm{au}$ scale via
grains aligned with the B-field, even relatively small grains of
$1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ in size need to have their magnetic susceptibilities
significantly enhanced (by a factor of ${\sim} 20$) over the standard value,
potentially through superparamagnetic inclusions. This requirement is more
stringent for larger grains, with the enhancement factor increasing linearly
with the grain size, reaching ${\sim} 2\times 10^4$ for millimeter-sized
grains. Even if the required enhancement can be achieved, the resulting
inferred magnetic field orientation in the simulation does not show a
preference for the major axis, which is inconsistent with the observed pattern.
We thus conclude that the observed trends are best described by the model where
the polarization on the envelope scale is dominated by magnetically aligned
grains and that on the disk scale by scattering.

of radiative processes at different cosmic epochs, including the
pre-reionization era when metal-free, Population III (Pop III) stars first
formed. While the radiation from metal-enriched, Population II (Pop II) stars
likely dominates the contribution to the observed NIRB from the reionization
era, Pop III stars -- if formed efficiently -- might leave characteristic
imprints on the NIRB thanks to their strong Ly$\alpha$ emission. Using a
physically-motivated model of first star formation, we provide an analysis of
the NIRB mean spectrum and anisotropy contributed by stellar populations at
$z>5$. We find that in circumstances where massive Pop III stars persistently
form in molecular cooling haloes at a rate of a few times $10^{-3}\,M_\odot \
\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, before being suppressed towards the epoch of reionization
(EoR) by the accumulated Lyman-Werner background, a unique spectral signature
shows up redward of $1\,\mu$m in the observed NIRB spectrum sourced by galaxies
at $z>5$. While the detailed shape and amplitude of the spectral signature
depend on various factors including the star formation histories, IMF, LyC
escape fraction and so forth, the most interesting scenarios with efficient Pop
III star formation are within the reach of forthcoming facilities such as the
Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and
Ices Explorer (SPHEREx). As a result, new constraints on the abundance and
formation history of Pop III stars at high redshifts will be available through
precise measurements of the NIRB in the next few years.

rise to asymptotically free theories. In this way (1+1)-d CP(N-1) models emerge
by dimensional reduction from (2+1)-d SU(N) quantum spin ladders, the (2+1)-d

used in the Galam model of opinion dynamics and bottom-up hierarchical voting.
A different probability for a flip against the local majority within the
discussion group is associated with each ratio of majority / minority. The
cases of groups of sizes 3 and 5 are investigated in detail. For hierarchical
voting, the local flip corresponds to a `faithless elector', a representative
who decides to vote against the choice of their electing group. Depending on
the flip probabilities, the model exhibits a rich variety of patterns for the
dynamics, which include novel features in the topology of the landscape. In
particular, for size 5, we uncover for the first time an interplay between five
fixed points, which split into either three attractors and two tipping points
or two attractors and three tipping points, depending on the flip
probabilities. Larger groups are also analysed. These features were absent in
the former versions of the Galam model, which has at maximum three fixed points
for any group size. The results shed a new light on a series of social
phenomena triggered by one single individual who acts against the local
majority.

many Machine Learning problems. In fact, recently MDPs have also emerged as a
powerful framework to model financial trading tasks. For example, financial
MDPs can model different market scenarios. However, the learning of a
(near-)optimal policy for each of these financial MDPs can be a very
time-consuming process, especially when nothing is known about the policy to
begin with. An alternative approach is to find a similar financial MDP for
which we have already learned its policy, and then reuse such policy in the
learning of a new policy for a new financial MDP. Such a knowledge transfer
between market scenarios raises several issues. On the one hand, how to measure
the similarity between financial MDPs. On the other hand, how to use this
similarity measurement to effectively transfer the knowledge between financial
MDPs. This paper addresses both of these issues. Regarding the first one, this
paper analyzes the use of three similarity metrics based on conceptual,
structural and performance aspects of the financial MDPs. Regarding the second
one, this paper uses Probabilistic Policy Reuse to balance the
exploitation/exploration in the learning of a new financial MDP according to
the similarity of the previous financial MDPs whose knowledge is reused.

learning, as using incomplete or unsuitable policies can lead to execution
failures. Generalisation is particularly relevant when a robot has to deal with
a large variety of objects and in different contexts. In this paper, we propose
and analyse a strategy for generalising parameterised execution models of
manipulation actions over different objects based on an object ontology. In
particular, a robot transfers a known execution model to objects of related
classes according to the ontology, but only if there is no other evidence that
the model may be unsuitable. This allows using ontological knowledge as prior
information that is then refined by the robot's own experiences. We verify our
algorithm for two actions - grasping and stowing everyday objects - such that
we show that the robot can deduce cases in which an existing policy can
generalise to other objects and when additional execution knowledge has to be
acquired.

an electron-ion plasma with cold ions, a bi-ion plasma with two types of warm

electron-ion plasma, the wave-induced ion flux is directed oppositely to the
phase speed of the nonlinear ion-acoustic wave. In the bi-ion plasma, there are
two modes of ion-acoustic waves which are fast and slow waves. In the nonlinear
fast ion-acoustic wave, the fluxes of both types of ions are found to be
co-directed and drift against the wave. In a slow wave, the nonlinear fluxes of
ions are directed in opposite directions. This result demonstrates the
possibility to use these nonlinear wave-induced ion fluxes for effective
separation of ions in the plasma. In a dusty bi-ion plasma, the ion separation

gas-grain processes in molecular clouds, with the main components being $H_2O$,
$CO$, and $CO_2$. $CH_3OH$ ice is detected towards the denser regions, where
large amounts of $CO$ freeze out and get hydrogenated. Heating from nearby
protostars can further change the ice structure and composition. Despite the
several observations of icy features towards molecular clouds and along the
line of site of protostars, it is not yet clear if interstellar ices are mixed
or if they have a layered structure. Aims. We aim to examine the effect of
mixed and layered ice growth in ice mantle analogues, with focus on the
position and shape of methanol infrared bands, so future observations could
shed light on the structure of interstellar ices in different environments.
Methods. Mixed and layered ice samples were deposited on a cold substrate kept
at T = 10 K using a closed-cycle cryostat placed in a vacuum chamber. The
spectroscopic features were analysed by FTIR spectroscopy. Different
proportions of the most abundant four molecules in ice mantles, namely $H_2O$,
$CO$, $CO_2$, and $CH_3OH$, were investigated, with special attention on the
analysis of the $CH_3OH$ bands. Results. We measure changes in the position and
shape of the CH and CO stretching bands of $CH_3OH$ depending on the mixed or
layered nature of the ice sample. Spectroscopic features of methanol are also
found to change due to heating. Conclusions. A layered ice structure best
reproduces the $CH_3OH$ band position recently observed towards a pre-stellar
core and in star-forming regions. Based on our experimental results, we
conclude that observations of $CH_3OH$ ices can provide information about the
structure of interstellar ices, and we expect JWST to put stringent constraints
on the layered or mixed nature of ices in different interstellar environments.

  Dichotomy","19 pages, 10 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The class of $k$-star caterpillar convex bipartite graphs generalizes the
class of convex bipartite graphs. For a bipartite graph with partitions $X$ and
$Y$, we associate a $k$-star caterpillar on $X$ such that for each vertex in
$Y$, its neighborhood induces a tree. The $k$-star caterpillar on $X$ is
imaginary and if the imaginary structure is a path ($0$-star caterpillar), then
it is the class of convex bipartite graphs. The minimum Steiner tree problem
(STREE) is defined as follows: given a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a subset
of vertices $R \subseteq V(G)$, the objective is to find a minimum cardinality
set $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that the set $R \cup S$ induces a connected
subgraph. STREE is known to be NP-complete on general graphs as well as for
special graph classes such as chordal graphs, bipartite graphs, and chordal
bipartite graphs. The complexity of STREE in convex bipartite graphs, which is
a popular subclass of chordal bipartite graphs, is open. In this paper, we
introduce $k$-star caterpillar convex bipartite graphs, and show that STREE is
NP-complete for $1$-star caterpillar convex bipartite graphs and
polynomial-time solvable for $0$-star caterpillar convex bipartite graphs (also
known as convex bipartite graphs). In \cite{muller1987np}, it is shown that
STREE in chordal bipartite graphs is NP-complete. A close look at the reduction
instances reveal that the instances are $3$-star caterpillar convex bipartite
graphs, and in this paper, we strengthen the result of \cite{muller1987np}.

incarnation of neural networks. Briefly, BP is an algorithm that exploits the
computational architecture of neural networks to efficiently evaluate the
gradient of a cost function during neural network parameter optimization. The
validity of BP rests on the application of a multivariate chain rule to the
computational architecture of neural networks and their associated objective
functions. Introductions to deep learning theory commonly present the
computational architecture of neural networks in matrix form, but eschew a
parallel formulation and justification of BP in the framework of matrix
differential calculus. This entails several drawbacks for the theory and
didactics of deep learning. In this work, we overcome these limitations by
providing a full induction proof of the BP algorithm in matrix notation.
Specifically, we situate the BP algorithm in the framework of matrix
differential calculus, encompass affine-linear potential functions, prove the
validity of the BP algorithm in inductive form, and exemplify the
implementation of the matrix form BP algorithm in computer code.

  Localization and Detection",,,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Joint sound event localization and detection (SELD) is an emerging audio
signal processing task adding spatial dimensions to acoustic scene analysis and
sound event detection. A popular approach to modeling SELD jointly is using
convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) models, where CNNs learn
high-level features from multi-channel audio input and the RNNs learn temporal
relationships from these high-level features. However, RNNs have some
drawbacks, such as a limited capability to model long temporal dependencies and
slow training and inference times due to their sequential processing nature.
Recently, a few SELD studies used multi-head self-attention (MHSA), among other
innovations in their models. MHSA and the related transformer networks have
shown state-of-the-art performance in various domains. While they can model
long temporal dependencies, they can also be parallelized efficiently. In this
paper, we study in detail the effect of MHSA on the SELD task. Specifically, we
examined the effects of replacing the RNN blocks with self-attention layers. We
studied the influence of stacking multiple self-attention blocks, using
multiple attention heads in each self-attention block, and the effect of
position embeddings and layer normalization. Evaluation on the DCASE 2021 SELD
(task 3) development data set shows a significant improvement in all employed

shift in the $m-z$ plane between sources lying along the velocity vector and
those in the opposite direction, providing a measure of the peculiar velocity.
Accordingly, from a sample of $\sim 1.2 \times 10^5$ mid-infrared quasars with
measured spectroscopic redshifts, we arrive at a peculiar velocity $\sim 22$
times larger than that from the CMBR dipole, but direction matching within
$\sim 2\sigma$. Previous findings from number count, sky brightness or redshift
dipoles observed in samples of distant AGNs or SNe Ia too had yielded values
two to ten times larger than the CMBR value, %but this by far is the largest
value arrived at for the peculiar motion, though the direction in all cases
agreed with the CMBR dipole. Since a genuine solar peculiar velocity cannot
vary from one dataset to the other, an order of magnitude, statistically
significant, discordant dipoles, might imply that we may instead have to look
for some other cause for the genesis of these dipole, including that of the
CMBR. At the same time, a common direction for all these dipoles, determined
from completely independent surveys by different groups employing different
techniques, might indicate that these dipoles are not resulting from some
systematics in the observations or in the data analysis, but could instead
suggest a preferred direction in the Universe due to an inherent anisotropy,
which, in turn, would be against the Cosmological Principle (CP), the most
basic tenet of the modern cosmology.

the most precise measurements of supermassive black hole masses, as well as
independent constraints on the Hubble constant in the nearby universe. The
existence of other maser types, such as jet or outflow masers, represents
another tracer for AGN science. However, the detection rate of water megamasers
in galaxies is extremely low. Over 40 years, only $\sim$ 160 galaxies are found
to harbour maser emission, and $\sim$ 30\% of them show features in their maser
emission that indicate a disk-like geometry. Therefore, increasing the
detection rate of masers is a crucial task to allow expanding on maser studies.
We present a comparison of mid-infrared spectroscopic data between a maser
galaxy sample and a Seyfert 2 control sample. We find that maser galaxies show
significant peculiarities in their mid-infrared spectra: (1) Maser galaxies
tend to present stronger silicate absorption at $\tau$ 9.7 $\mu$m than the
control sample, (2) PAH 11.3 $\mu$m emission in maser galaxies is much weaker
than in the control sample, (3) spectral indices at 20-30 $\mu$m are steeper in
maser galaxies than in the control sample and tend to be mid-infrared enhanced
population. We conclude that there may be good indicators in mid-infrared and
far-infrared which could differentiate maser and non-maser Seyfert 2 galaxies.
Upcoming infrared facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, may be
able to exploit these and other useful criteria and tracers for water megamaser
observations.

a formal, sliding likelihood-ratio test of the model against the data. Our
proposed approach is designed to detect error occurrence on various temporal
scales, which is especially useful in hydrological modelling. We illustrate
this by applying our proposed method to soil moisture modeling. We test tBME as
model error indicator on several synthetic and real-world test cases that we
designed to vary in error sources and error time scales. Results prove the
usefulness of the framework for detecting structural errors in dynamic models.
Moreover, the time sequence of posterior parameter distributions helps to
investigate the reasons for model error and provide guidance for model
improvement.

various granularities, e.g., classes, methods, and statements. Most of the
automated fault localization (AFL) approaches are coarse-grained because it is
challenging to accurately locate fine-grained faulty software elements, e.g.,
statements. SBFL, based on dynamic execution of test cases only, is simple,
intuitive, and generic (working on various granularities). However, its
accuracy deserves significant improvement. To this end, in this paper, we
propose a hybrid fine-grained AFL approach based on both dynamic spectrums and
static statement types. The rationale of the approach is that some types of
statements are significantly more/less error-prone than others, and thus
statement types could be exploited for fault localization. On a crop of faulty
programs, we compute the error-proneness for each type of statements, and
assign priorities to special statement types that are steadily more/less
error-prone than others. For a given faulty program under test, we first
leverage traditional spectrum-based fault localization algorithm to identify
all suspicious statements and to compute their suspicious scores. For each of
the resulting suspicious statements, we retrieve its statement type as well as
the special priority associated with the type. The final suspicious score is
the product of the SBFL suspicious score and the priority assigned to the
statement type. A significant advantage of the approach is that it is simple
and intuitive, making it efficient and easy to interpret/implement. We evaluate
the proposed approach on widely used benchmark Defects4J. The evaluation
results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms widely used SBFL,
reducing the absolute waste effort (AWE) by 9.3% on average.

  Hardware-accelerated MLPs and RNNs",,,,,"cs.AR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success for cognitive
applications. The core operation in a DNN is the dot product between quantized
inputs and weights. Prior works exploit the weight/input repetition that arises
due to quantization to avoid redundant computations in Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). However, in this paper we show that their effectiveness is
severely limited when applied to Fully-Connected (FC) layers, which are
commonly used in state-of-the-art DNNs, as it is the case of modern Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models.
  To improve energy-efficiency of FC computation we present CREW, a hardware
accelerator that implements Computation Reuse and an Efficient Weight Storage
mechanism to exploit the large number of repeated weights in FC layers. CREW
first performs the multiplications of the unique weights by their respective
inputs and stores the results in an on-chip buffer. The storage requirements
are modest due to the small number of unique weights and the relatively small
size of the input compared to convolutional layers. Next, CREW computes each
output by fetching and adding its required products. To this end, each weight
is replaced offline by an index in the buffer of unique products. Indices are
typically smaller than the quantized weights, since the number of unique
weights for each input tends to be much lower than the range of quantized
weights, which reduces storage and memory bandwidth requirements.
  Overall, CREW greatly reduces the number of multiplications and provides
significant savings in model memory footprint and memory bandwidth usage. We
evaluate CREW on a diverse set of modern DNNs. On average, CREW provides 2.61x
speedup and 2.42x energy savings over a TPU-like accelerator. Compared to UCNN,
a state-of-art computation reuse technique, CREW achieves 2.10x speedup and
2.08x energy savings on average.

accountability systems typically make fewer adjustments: for transparency to

only be used to solve complex fluid flows but also radiative transport in
volume. The present work derives a novel Fresnel boundary scheme for radiative
transport LBM, based on Fresnel's equation, which depicts the partly reflected
radiation on surfaces. Driven from a boundary modeling and discussion on the
microscopic level, incorporating Fresnel's equation, it is developed a boundary
model for the mesoscopic radiative transport LBM. At an intermediate step, the
Fresnel's equation is related to well known partial differential (Robin)
equations, based on a bottom-up approach where the P1-Approximation is
deployed. To connect the novel boundary scheme to the so derived target
equation, a Chapman-Enskog expansion is examined in addition. Both techniques
together, point out how to interpret microscopic modeling by the means of
macroscopic expressions and as a consequence how, to chose simulation
parameters according to the specific boundary. The numerical tests suggest that
the proposed boundary is first order convergent. The paper closes with a
showcase, where the novel boundary method for radiative transport LBM is
applied to a setup with multiple LED spots.

1515-273, undertaken in 2019 and extending from radio to very-high-energy gamma
rays (VHE). Up until now, this blazar had not been the subject of any detailed
MWL observations. It has a rather hard photon index at GeV energies and was
considered a candidate extreme high-synchrotronpeaked source. MAGIC
observations resulted in the first-time detection of the source in VHE with a
statistical significance of 7.6$\sigma$. The average integral VHE flux of the
source is 6 $\pm$ 1% of the Crab nebula flux above 400 GeV. X-ray coverage was
provided by Swift-XRT, XMMNewton, and NuSTAR. The long continuous X-ray
observations were separated by $\sim$ 9 h, both showing clear hour scale
flares. In the XMM-Newton data, both the rise and decay timescales are longer
in the soft X-ray than in the hard X-ray band, indicating the presence of a
particle cooling regime. The X-ray variability timescales were used to
constrain the size of the emission region and the strength of the magnetic
field. The data allowed us to determine the synchrotron peak frequency and
classify the source as a flaring high, but not extreme, synchrotron peaked
object. Considering the constraints and variability patterns from the X-ray
data, we model the broad-band spectral energy distribution. We applied a simple
one-zone model, which could not reproduce the radio emission and the shape of
the optical emission, and a two-component leptonic model with two interacting
components, enabling us to reproduce the emission from radio to VHE band.

eclipse was estimated to be $S_{\odot} = (959.95\pm 0.05)""$ at $1\,au$ with no
significant dependence on wavelength. The measurement was obtained from the
analysis of a video of the eclipse flash spectrum recorded at the southern
limit of the umbral shadow path. Our analysis was conducted by extracting light
curves from the flash spectrum and comparing them to simulated light curves.
Simulations were performed by integrating the limb darkening function (LDF)
over the exposed area of photosphere. These numerical integrations relied upon
very precise computations of the relative movement of the lunar and solar
limbs.

The idea
underlying the model is that the houses are randomly being built on a
rectangular tract of land according to the specified rule until the maximal
configuration is reached, that is, no further houses can be built while still
following that rule. Once the building of the settlement is done, the main
question is what percentage of the tract of land on which the settlement was
built has been used, i.e. what is the building density of the maximal
configuration that was reached. In this article, with the aid of simulations,
we find an estimate for the average building density of maximal configurations
and we study what happens with this average when the size of a tract of land
grows to infinity.

still largely employed for modeling phenomena in various scientific fields.
However, when the number of components $p$ is of the same asymptotic order as
the sample size $n$, standard inferential techniques are generally inadequate
to conduct hypothesis testing on the mean vector and/or the covariance matrix.
Within several prominent frameworks, we propose then to draw reliable
conclusions via a directional test. We show that under the null hypothesis the
directional $p$-value is exactly uniformly distributed even when $p$ is of the
same order of $n$, provided that conditions for the existence of the maximum
likelihood estimate for the normal model are satisfied. Extensive simulation
results confirm the theoretical findings across different values of $p/n$, and
show that under the null hypothesis the directional test outperforms not only
the usual first and higher-order finite-$p$ solutions but also alternative
methods tailored for high-dimensional settings. Simulation results also
indicate that the power performance of the different tests depends on the
specific alternative hypothesis.

that can be simultaneously met. We propose an alternative definition of a value
of an instance and show that, for purely combinatorial reasons, a value of an
unsolvable instance is bounded away from one; we call this fact a gap theorem.
  We show that the gap theorem implies NP-hardness of a gap version of the
Layered Label Cover Problem. The same result can be derived from the PCP
Theorem, but a full, self-contained proof of our reduction is quite short and
the result can still provide PCP-free NP-hardness proofs for numerous problems.
The simplicity of our reasoning also suggests that weaker versions of
Unique-Games-type conjectures, e.g., the d-to-1 conjecture, might be accessible
and serve as an intermediate step for proving these conjectures in their full
strength.
  As the second, main application we provide a sufficient condition under which
a fixed template Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) reduces to
another PCSP. The correctness of the reduction hinges on the gap theorem, but
the reduction itself is very simple. As a consequence, we obtain that every CSP
can be canonically reduced to most of the known NP-hard PCSPs, such as the
approximate hypergraph coloring problem.

there are exactly two fixed points, a rotation of an even dimensional sphere
provides an example in any even dimension. (4) On any even dimension (greater

Therefore, both from small numbers of fixed points and from low dimensions, the
first case for which an answer is not known is whether there exists a
12-dimensional manifold with exactly three fixed points. In this paper, we
prove that there does not exist a circle action on a 12-dimensional compact

studied analytically in field theoretical method. Modeling the system as a
fluid in hydrostatical equilibrium, we apply Schwinger's functional derivative
on the average of the field equation of mass density, and obtain the field
equation of 2-point correlation function $\xi(r)$ of the mass density
fluctuation, which includes the next order of nonlinearity beyond the Gaussian
approximation. The 3-point correlation occurs hierarchically in the equation,
and is cut off by the Groth-Peebles anzats, making it closed. We perform
renormalization, and write the equation with three nonlinear coefficients. The
equation tells that $\xi $ depends on the point mass $m$ and the Jeans
wavelength scale $\lambda_{0}$, which are different for galaxies and clusters.
Applying to large scale structure, it predicts that the profile of $\xi_{cc} $
of clusters is similar to $\xi_{gg}$ of galaxies but with a higher amplitude,
and that the correlation length increases with the mean separation between
clusters, i.e, a scaling behavior $r_0\simeq 0.4d$. The solution yields the
galaxy correlation $\xi_{gg}(r) \simeq (r_0/r)^{1.7}$ valid only in a range
$1<r<10 \,h^{-1}$Mpc. At larger scales the solution $\xi_{gg} $ deviates below
the power law and goes to zero around $\sim 50 \, h^{-1}$Mpc, just as the
observations show. We also derive the field equation of 3-point correlation
function in Gaussian approximation and its analytical solution, for which the

connectionist temporal classification with mask-predict (Mask-CTC) NAR. During
inference, the input audio is separated into small blocks and then processed in
a blockwise streaming way. To address the insertion and deletion error at the
edge of the output of each block, we apply an overlapping decoding strategy
with a dynamic mapping trick that can produce more coherent sentences.
Experimental results show that the proposed method improves online ASR
recognition in low latency conditions compared to vanilla Mask-CTC. Moreover,
it can achieve a much faster inference speed compared to the AR attention-based

TypeClassifier utilizes a two-level attention mechanism to decouple different
nested level representations and better distinguish entity types. We jointly
train both modules sharing a common representation and a new dual-info
attention layer, which leads to improved representation focus on entity-related

The process involves a number of intermediate states equal to the Landau
degeneracy: each of these states consists of a virtual cavity photon and an
electron excited in the next Landau band with the same spin. We study such a
cavity-mediated hopping mechanism in the dual presence of a random disordered

attempts to explain their training dynamics and generalization performance, but
more guiding principles for the training of neural networks are still needed.
Motivated by the edge of chaos principle behind the optimal performance of
neural networks, we study the role of various hyperparameters in modern neural
network training algorithms in terms of the order-chaos phase diagram. In
particular, we study a fully analytical feedforward neural network trained on
the widely adopted Fashion-MNIST dataset, and study the dynamics associated
with the hyperparameters in back-propagation during the training process. We
find that for the basic algorithm of stochastic gradient descent with momentum,
in the range around the commonly used hyperparameter values, clear scaling
relations are present with respect to the training time during the ordered
phase in the phase diagram, and the model's optimal generalization power at the
edge of chaos is similar across different training parameter combinations. In
the chaotic phase, the same scaling no longer exists. The scaling allows us to
choose the training parameters to achieve faster training without sacrificing
performance. In addition, we find that the commonly used model regularization
method - weight decay - effectively pushes the model towards the ordered phase
to achieve better performance. Leveraging on this fact and the scaling
relations in the other hyperparameters, we derived a principled guideline for
hyperparameter determination, such that the model can achieve optimal
performance by saturating it at the edge of chaos. Demonstrated on this simple
neural network model and training algorithm, our work improves the
understanding of neural network training dynamics, and can potentially be
extended to guiding principles of more complex model architectures and
algorithms.

principles which yield strong point-wise control of the physical solutions in
terms of the boundary data, the initial conditions and the operator
coefficients. Sharp/strict maximum principles insomuch of fundamental
importance for the continuous problem often do not persist under numerical
discretization. A lot of past research concentrates on designing fine numerical
schemes which preserves the sharp maximum principles especially for nonlinear
problems. However these sharp principles not only sometimes introduce unwanted
stringent conditions on the numerical schemes but also completely leaves many
powerful frequency-based methods unattended and rarely analyzed directly in the
sharp maximum norm topology. A prominent example is the spectral methods in the
family of weighted residual methods.
  In this work we introduce and develop a new framework of almost sharp maximum
principles which allow the numerical solutions to deviate from the sharp bound
by a controllable discretization error: we call them effective maximum
principles. We showcase the analysis for the classical Fourier spectral methods
including Fourier Galerkin and Fourier collocation in space with forward Euler
in time or second order Strang splitting. The model equations include the
Allen-Cahn equations with double well potential, the Burgers equation and the
Navier-Stokes equations. We give a comprehensive proof of the effective maximum
principles under very general parametric conditions.

crystallographic symmetry and on the in-plane orientation of the structures
themselves along the planar directions. By comparing the etching evolution at
two different length scales, we distinguish two regimes for the propagation of
the etching front: an intrinsic one, owning to a specific lattice direction,
and a macroscopic one, resulting from the mixing of different etching fronts.
We report the morphologies of the etched SrTiO3 surfaces and the geometries of
the underetched regions as well as of the microbridge clamping zones. The

is encountered in many practical applications like enhanced oil recovery or
groundwater remediation. To understand the flow dynamics of these complex
fluids in porous media, a model porous media consisting of a straight
microchannel with micropore throats present in it, is very often used. In this
study, we perform an extensive numerical investigation to understand the flow
dynamics of wormlike micellar solutions based on the two-species
Vasquez-Cook-McKinley (VCM) model for micelles through such model porous media.
We find the existence of an elastic instability once the Weissenberg number
exceeds a critical value; likewise, it was seen in many prior experimental and
numerical studies dealing with polymer solutions. However, for the present case
of a WLM solution, we observe that this elastic instability is greatly
influenced by the breakage and reformation mechanisms of the wormlike micelles.
In particular, we notice that the intensity of this instability (characterized
by the fluctuating flow fields) increases as the Weissenberg number increases;
however, beyond a critical value of it, this elastic instability and/or the
flow field fluctuation is suppressed because of the breakage of long micelles.
This is in contrast to the polymer solutions for which the flow field gradually
transits to a more chaotic and turbulent-like state (or the so-called elastic
turbulence state) as the Weissenberg number gradually increases. Additionally,
we observe that the flow dynamics of these WLM solutions are strongly dependent
on the type of micropore throat, the number of pore throats, and the spacing
between two consecutive pore throats. An extensive discussion on the pressure
drop and apparent viscosity is also presented in the present study.

methods relying on compressed communication are becoming increasingly popular.
Besides, the best theoretically and practically performing gradient-type
methods invariably rely on some form of acceleration/momentum to reduce the
number of communications (faster convergence), e.g., Nesterov's accelerated
gradient descent (Nesterov, 1983, 2004) and Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014). In
order to combine the benefits of communication compression and convergence
acceleration, we propose a \emph{compressed and accelerated} gradient method
based on ANITA (Li, 2021) for distributed optimization, which we call CANITA.
Our CANITA achieves the \emph{first accelerated rate}
$O\bigg(\sqrt{\Big(1+\sqrt{\frac{\omega^3}{n}}\Big)\frac{L}{\epsilon}} +
\omega\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big)^{\frac{1}{3}}\bigg)$, which improves upon
the state-of-the-art non-accelerated rate
$O\left((1+\frac{\omega}{n})\frac{L}{\epsilon} +
\frac{\omega^2+\omega}{\omega+n}\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ of DIANA (Khaled et
al., 2020) for distributed general convex problems, where $\epsilon$ is the
target error, $L$ is the smooth parameter of the objective, $n$ is the number
of machines/devices, and $\omega$ is the compression parameter (larger $\omega$
means more compression can be applied, and no compression implies $\omega=0$).
Our results show that as long as the number of devices $n$ is large (often true
in distributed/federated learning), or the compression $\omega$ is not very
high, CANITA achieves the faster convergence rate
$O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}}\Big)$, i.e., the number of communication
rounds is $O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}}\Big)$ (vs.
$O\big(\frac{L}{\epsilon}\big)$ achieved by previous works). As a result,
CANITA enjoys the advantages of both compression (compressed communication in
each round) and acceleration (much fewer communication rounds).

optimizations that optimize a grey-scale permittivity defined over a grid, and
discrete level-set optimizations that optimize the shape of the material

find an initial seed for a concluding level-set optimization since level-set
techniques tend to benefit from a well-performing initial structure. However,
continuous optimizations are not guaranteed to yield sufficient initial seeds
for subsequent level-set optimizations, particularly for high-contrast
structures, since they are not guaranteed to converge to solutions that
resemble only two discrete materials. In this work, we present a method for
constraining a continuous optimization such that it converges to a discrete
solution. This is done by inserting a constrained sub-optimization at each
iteration of an overall gradient-based optimization. This technique can be used
purely on its own to optimize a device, or it can be used to provide a nearly

unclear. Given the demonstrated capacity of ransomware authors to innovate in

virtual currencies and anonymity networks), it is important to better
understand the risks involved and identify potential mitigations.
  As a basis for comprehensive security and performance analysis of

  We propose two plausible victim models and analyse, from an attacker's

manifold is governed by the Euler equations. In recent papers [5, 6, 7, 8]
several unknown facets of the Euler flows have been discovered, including
universality properties of the stationary solutions to the Euler equations. The
study of these universality features was suggested by Tao as a novel way to
address the problem of global existence for Euler and Navier-Stokes [28].
Universality of the Euler equations was proved in [7] for stationary solutions
using a contact mirror which reflects a Beltrami flow as a Reeb vector field.
This contact mirror permits the use of advanced geometric techniques in fluid
dynamics. On the other hand, motivated by Tao's approach relating Turing
machines to Navier-Stokes equations, a Turing complete stationary Euler
solution on a Riemannian $3$-dimensional sphere was constructed in [8]. Since
the Turing completeness of a vector field can be characterized in terms of the
halting problem, which is known to be undecidable [30], a striking consequence
of this fact is that a Turing complete Euler flow exhibits undecidable particle
paths [8]. In this article, we give a panoramic overview of this fascinating
subject, and go one step further in investigating the undecidability of
different dynamical properties of Turing complete flows. In particular, we show
that variations of [8] allow us to construct a stationary Euler flow of
Beltrami type (and, via the contact mirror, a Reeb vector field) for which it
is undecidable to determine whether its orbits through an explicit set of
points are periodic.

post-Keplerian parameters which quantify the observed relativistic effects. We
present improved analysis of archival VLBI data, using a coordinate convention
in full agreement with that used in timing. We also obtain much improved
polarimetry with FAST. We provide an analysis of significantly extended timing
data taken with Effelsberg, Nancay, Lovell and Green Bank telescopes. From VLBI
analysis we obtain a new estimate of the position angle of ascending node,
Omega=189(19) deg, and a new position of the pulsar with more conservative
uncertainty. The FAST polarimetry and in particular the detection of an
interpulse, yield much improved estimate for the spin geometry of the pulsar,
in particular an inclination of the spin axis of 84 deg. From the timing we
obtain a new 1% test of general relativity (GR) from the agreement of the
Shapiro delay and the advance rate of periastron. Assuming GR in a
self-consistent analysis of all effects, we obtain much improved mass:
1.831(10) M_sun for the pulsar and 1.319(4) M_sun for the companion; the total
mass, 3.150(14) M_sun confirms it as the most massive double degenerate binary
known in the Galaxy. This analysis also yields the orbital orientation: the
orbital inclination is 85.27(4) deg, indicating a close alignment between the
spin of the pulsar and the orbital angular momentum; Omega = 188(6) deg,
matching our VLBI result. We also obtain precise value of the orbital period

mergers can cause SGRBs, afterglow observations will also provide an
alternative measurement of the BNS merger rate independent of
gravitational-wave observations. In previous work by Feng et al. (2014), the
feasibility of the detection of afterglows was considered using a variety of
radio observatories and a simple flux threshold detection algorithm. Here, we
consider a more sophisticated detection algorithm for SGRB afterglows, and
provide an estimate of the trials factors for a realistic search to obtain an
updated estimate of the possibility of observing afterglows with the Canadian
Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). We estimate 893 and 312

$3^\circ$ to $8^\circ$ with the median $6^\circ$. We also find 88% and 98%,
respectively, of the detectable afterglows for each jet opening distribution
are off-axis, which are candidates for orphan afterglows. Our result predicts
fewer detectable sources per year than the earlier analysis, but confirms the
essential conclusion that using CHIME to search for afterglows will be
effective at constraining the astrophysical merger rate.

of the Sun that show element abundance peculiarities in their spectra. The
radiative levitation and diffusive settling processes responsible for these
abundance anomalies should also deplete helium from the region of the envelope
that drives delta Scuti pulsations. Therefore, these stars are not expected to
be delta Scuti stars, which pulsate in multiple radial and nonradial modes with
periods of around 2 hours. As part of the NASA TESS Guest Investigator Program,
we proposed photometric observations in 2-minute cadence for samples of bright
(visual magnitudes around 7-8) Am stars. Our 2020 SAS meeting paper reported on
observations of 21 stars, finding one delta Scuti star and two delta Scuti /
gamma Doradus hybrid candidates, as well as many stars with photometric
variability possibly caused by rotation and starspots. Here we present an
update including 34 additional stars observed up to February 2021, among them
three delta Scuti stars and two delta Scuti / gamma Doradus hybrid candidates.
Confirming the pulsations in these stars requires further data analysis and
follow-up observations, because of possible background stars or contamination
in the TESS CCD pixels with scale 21 arc sec per pixel. Asteroseismic modeling
of these stars will be important to understand the reasons for their

models. In this paper, we investigate the mentioned question by (a) introducing

trade-offs of a hierarchy of existing models, i.e., the ones in the reference

competitive in terms of time-space trade-off with existing proposals. The
Synoptic Recursive Model Index and the bi-criteria Piece-wise Geometric Model

(MLkC) problem where we are given a set $P$ of $n$ points in a metric space
that we have to cluster and an integer $k$ that denotes the number of clusters.
Additionally, we are given a set $F$ of cluster centers in the same metric
space. The goal is to select a set $C\subseteq F$ of $k$ centers and assign
each point in $P$ to a center in $C$, such that the maximum load over all
centers is minimized. Here the load of a center is the sum of the distances
between it and the points assigned to it.
  Although clustering/facility location problems have a rich literature, the
minimum-load objective is not studied substantially, and hence MLkC has
remained a poorly understood problem. More interestingly, the problem is
notoriously hard even in some special cases including the one in line metrics
as shown by Ahmadian et al. [ACM Trans. Algo. 2018]. They also show
APX-hardness of the problem in the plane. On the other hand, the best-known
approximation factor for MLkC is $O(k)$, even in the plane.
  In this work, we study a fair version of MLkC inspired by the work of
Chierichetti et al. [NeurIPS, 2017], which generalizes MLkC. Here the input
points are colored by one of the $\ell$ colors denoting the group they belong
to. MLkC is the special case with $\ell=1$. Considering this problem, we are
able to obtain a $3$-approximation in $f(k,\ell)\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time. Also, our
scheme leads to an improved $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation in case of Euclidean
norm, and in this case, the running time depends only polynomially on the
dimension $d$. Our results imply the same approximations for MLkC with running
time $f(k)\cdot n^{O(1)}$, achieving the first constant approximations for this
problem in general and Euclidean metric spaces.

we consider three cases of FoV viewing probability distributions, i.e.,

the average total utility, worst average total utility, and worst total utility
as the respective performance metrics. In the single-user scenario, we optimize
the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the FoVs, and transmission
beamforming vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the total utility in each

we separate the challenging optimization problem into multiple tractable

properties required to define physical theories on the classified spacetime
geometries. The work completed in substantiating this framework for
kinematical, super-kinematical, and super-Bargmann symmetries constitutes the
body of this thesis.
  To this end, the classification of kinematical Lie algebras in spatial
dimension $D = 3$, as presented in [3, 4], is reviewed; as is the
classification of spatially-isotropic homogeneous spacetimes of [5]. The
derivation of geometric properties such as the non-compactness of boosts,
soldering forms and vielbeins, and the space of invariant affine connections is
then presented.
  We move on to classify the $\mathcal{N}=1$ kinematical Lie superalgebras in
three spatial dimensions, finding 43 isomorphism classes of Lie superalgebras.
Once these algebras are determined, we classify the corresponding
simply-connected homogeneous (4|4)-dimensional superspaces and show how the
resulting 27 homogeneous superspaces may be related to one another via
geometric limits.
  Finally, we turn our attention to generalised Bargmann superalgebras. In the
present work, these will be the $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$
super-extensions of the Bargmann and Newton-Hooke algebras, as well as the
centrally-extended static kinematical Lie algebra, of which the former three
all arise as deformations. Focussing solely on three spatial dimensions, we
find $9$ isomorphism classes in the $\mathcal{N}=1$ case, and we identify $22$
branches of superalgebras in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ case.

more prevalent in highly complex classes than less complex classes. The found

display characteristic scaling properties as a signature of the nature of
disorder in their supporting medium, i.e. of the statistical features of its
heterogeneities. Different methods have been used to extract roughness
information from such self-affine structures, and in particular their scaling
exponents and associated prefactors. Notably, for an experimental
characterization of roughness features, it is of paramount importance to
properly assess sample-to-sample fluctuations of roughness parameters. Here, by
performing scaling analysis based on displacement correlation functions in real
and reciprocal space, we compute statistical properties of the roughness
parameters. As an ideal, artifact-free reference case study and particularly
targeting finite-size systems, we consider three cases of numerically simulated
one-dimensional interfaces: (i) elastic lines under thermal fluctuations and
free of disorder, (ii) directed polymers in equilibrium with a disordered
energy landscape, and (iii) elastic lines in the critical depinning state when
the external applied driving force equals the depinning force set by disorder.
Our results shows that sample-to-sample fluctuations are rather large when
measuring the roughness exponent. These fluctuations are also relevant for
roughness amplitudes. Therefore a minimum of independent interface realizations
(at least a few tens in our numerical simulations) should be used to guarantee
sufficient statistical averaging, an issue often overlooked in experimental
reports.

enable artificial intelligence (AI) at the network edge, where distributed
mobile devices collaboratively train a shared AI model under the coordination

over-the-air computation allows a large number of mobile devices to
concurrently upload their local models by exploiting the superposition property
of wireless multi-access channels. Due to wireless channel fading, the model
aggregation error at the edge server is dominated by the weakest channel among
all devices, causing severe straggler issues. In this paper, we propose a
relay-assisted cooperative FL scheme to effectively address the straggler
issue. In particular, we deploy multiple half-duplex relays to cooperatively
assist the devices in uploading the local model updates to the edge server. The
nature of the over-the-air computation poses system objectives and constraints
that are distinct from those in traditional relay communication systems.
Moreover, the strong coupling between the design variables renders the
optimization of such a system challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose an
alternating-optimization-based algorithm to optimize the transceiver and relay
operation with low complexity. Then, we analyze the model aggregation error in
a single-relay case and show that our relay-assisted scheme achieves a smaller
error than the one without relays provided that the relay transmit power and
the relay channel gains are sufficiently large. The analysis provides critical
insights on relay deployment in the implementation of cooperative FL. Extensive
numerical results show that our design achieves faster convergence compared
with state-of-the-art schemes.

previous estimates. We produced age and metallicity maps, and compared the
stellar population properties to those of the general ETGs population. We found
that CRDs have similar trends in age and metallicity to ETGs, but are less
metallic at low masses, and show flatter age and steeper metallicity gradients,
on average. A comparison of the velocity fields of the ionized gas and the
stars reveals that in 33 cases the gas corotates with either the inner (15

  We retrieve the highest Bayesian evidence for an isothermal atmosphere,
interpreted as a mean temperature of $3389\pm227$ K, a uniform day-to-night
side wind of $5.5^{+1.4}_{-2.0}\,$ km/s in the lower atmosphere with a vertical
wind in the upper atmosphere of $22.7^{+4.9}_{-4.1}\,$ km/s, switching
atmospheric wind patterns at $10^{-3}$ bar above the reference surface pressure

the need for vertical winds in the intermediate atmosphere above the layers

exploiting the resolved spectral line shapes to observationally constrain
possible wind patterns in exoplanet atmospheres, an invaluable input to more

approach adopted in this research work is to transform the delivery of a

  Using exoplanetary data of planets with measured masses and radii, we
investigate the relations between stellar mass and various planetary properties

contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Combined with a polynomial
description to the pion vector form factor, we obtain the best fit from the
Gounaris-Sakurai (or K\""uhn-Santamaria) model for the experimental data up to 1
GeV. By product, the branching ratio of $\omega \to \pi\pi$ can be extracted as
$\text{Br}(\omega\to\pi\pi)=(1.52\pm 0.06) \%$, which is consistent with the
one of Particle Data Group. With the best fit of the data, we obtain the muon
anomalous magnetic moment from two-pion contribution as
$a_{\mu}^{\mathrm{HVP,\; LO}}(\pi^{+} \pi^{-} \leq 1\ \text{GeV}) =

increase in the number of gravitational wave detections will make it possible
to estimate parameters of compact binaries with greater accuracy assuming
general relativity(GR), and also to carry out sharper tests of GR itself.
Crucial to these procedures are accurate gravitational waveform models. The
systematic errors of the models must stay below statistical errors to prevent
biases in parameter estimation and to carry out meaningful tests of GR.
Comparisons of the models against numerical relativity (NR) waveforms provide
an excellent measure of systematic errors. A complementary approach is to use
balance laws provided by Einstein's equations to measure faithfulness of a
candidate waveform against exact GR. Each balance law focuses on a physical
observable and measures the accuracy of the candidate waveform vis a vis that
observable. Therefore, this analysis can provide new physical insights into
sources of errors. In this paper we focus on the angular momentum balance law,
using post-Newtonian theory to calculate the initial angular momentum,
surrogate fits to obtain the remnant spin and waveforms from models to
calculate the flux. The consistency check provided by the angular momentum
balance law brings out the marked improvement in the passage from
\texttt{IMRPhenomPv2} to \texttt{IMRPhenomXPHM} and from \texttt{SEOBNRv3} to
\texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM} and shows that the most recent versions agree quite well
with exact GR. For precessing systems, on the other hand, we find that there is
room for further improvement, especially for the Phenom models.

from the anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP) 4U 0142+61. It is shown here that this

fallback disc surrounding this AXP. It is also found that the precession of

gravitational wave emission from precessing fallback discs possibly formed
around young pulsars such as Crab in a region extending beyond
8$\times$10$^{7}$ m from the pulsar surface is estimated. It is also evaluated
the role that infrared radiation emission from circumpulsar discs may play in
contributing to Inverse Compton Scattering of TeV energy positrons and
electrons. Extensive observational campaigns of disc formation around young and
middle aged pulsars may also contribute to solve the long-standing problem of a
pulsar origin for the excess of positrons in cosmic rays observed near Earth

high-level declarations of ethical principles have been put forth for this
purpose, but there is a severe lack of technical guidelines explicating the
practical consequences for medical machine learning. Similarly, there is
currently considerable uncertainty regarding the exact regulatory requirements
placed upon medical machine learning systems. This survey provides an overview
of the technical and procedural challenges involved in creating medical machine
learning systems responsibly and in conformity with existing regulations, as
well as possible solutions to address these challenges. First, a brief review
of existing regulations affecting medical machine learning is provided, showing
that properties such as safety, robustness, reliability, privacy, security,
transparency, explainability, and nondiscrimination are all demanded already by
existing law and regulations - albeit, in many cases, to an uncertain degree.
Next, the key technical obstacles to achieving these desirable properties are
discussed, as well as important techniques to overcome these obstacles in the
medical context. We notice that distribution shift, spurious correlations,
model underspecification, uncertainty quantification, and data scarcity
represent severe challenges in the medical context. Promising solution
approaches include the use of large and representative datasets and federated
learning as a means to that end, the careful exploitation of domain knowledge,
the use of inherently transparent models, comprehensive out-of-distribution
model testing and verification, as well as algorithmic impact assessments.

observe that these specific sites grow in defect density over time under
illumination, leading to local reductions in performance parameters. Scanning
electron diffraction measurements reveal concomitant structural changes at
phase impurities associated with trap clusters, with rapid conversion to
metallic lead through iodine depletion, eventually resulting in pinhole

densities and reverses performance degradation at these local clusters, where
phase impurities instead convert to amorphous and electronically benign lead

the TES design has to be optimized. Here we present the experimental results of
tests on different devices where the coupling between the x-ray absorber and
the TES sensor is varied. In particular, we look at the effects of the diameter
of the coupling stems and the distance between the stems and the TES bilayer.
Based on measurements of the AC complex impedance and noise, we observe a
reduction in the excess noise as the spacing between the absorber stem and the
bilayer is decreased. We identify the origin of this excess noise to be
internal thermal fluctuation noise between the absorber stem and the bilayer.
Additionally, we see an impact of the coupling on the superconducting
transition in the appearance of kinks. Our observations show that these
unwanted structures in the transition shape can be avoided with careful design
of the coupling geometry. Also the stem diameter appears to have a significant
impact on the smoothness of the TES transition. This observation is still
poorly understood, but is of great importance for both AC and DC biased TESs.

network based on the traffic speed outliers. Second, the algorithm identifies
pairs of subgraphs that indicate spatio-temporal correlations in their traffic
load behaviour to identify topological dependencies within the road network.
Finally, we rank the identified subgraph pairs based on the dependency score
determined by our algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that
ST-Discovery can effectively reveal topological dependencies in urban road
networks.

diverse populations (e.g., ageing and diseased), thus achieving robustness to a
wide range of morphological variability. We demonstrate SynthSeg on 5,000 scans
of six modalities (including CT) and ten resolutions, where it exhibits
unparalleled generalisation compared with supervised CNNs, state-of-the-art

inference stages. Conventionally, the sensing and communication stages are
executed sequentially, which results in excessive amount of dataset generation
and uploading time. This paper proposes to accelerate edge intelligence via
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). As such, the sensing and
communication stages are merged so as to make the best use of the wireless
signals for the dual purpose of dataset generation and uploading. However, ISAC
also introduces additional interference between sensing and communication
functionalities. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a
classification error minimization formulation to design the ISAC beamforming
and time allocation. The globally optimal solution is derived via the rank-1
guaranteed semidefinite relaxation, and performance analysis is performed to
quantify the ISAC gain over that of conventional edge intelligence. Simulation
results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ISAC-assisted
edge intelligence system. Interestingly, we find that ISAC is always
beneficial, when the duration of generating a sample is more than the duration
of uploading a sample. Otherwise, the ISAC gain can vanish or even be negative.
Nevertheless, we still derive a sufficient condition, under which a positive
ISAC gain is feasible.

only due to the introduction of new conserved charges i.e. $J_{N}=M\,N$~(where

closely analogue to the Kerr-like angular momentum parameter $J=a\,M$.

science and technology. The development of optical amplifiers has
revolutionized optical communications, which are today pervasively used in
virtually all sensing and communication applications of coherent laser sources.
In the telecommunication bands, optical amplifiers typically utilize gain media
based on III-V semiconductors or rare-earth-doped fibers. Another way to
amplify optical signals is to utilize the Kerr nonlinearity of optical fibers
or waveguides via parametric processes. Such parametric amplifiers of
travelling continuous wave have been originally developed in the microwave
domain, and enable quantum-limited signal amplification with high peak gain,
broadband gain spectrum tailored via dispersion control, and ability to enable
phase sensitive amplification. Despite these advantages, optical amplifiers
based on parametric gain have proven impractical in silica fibers due to the
low Kerr nonlinearity. Recent advances in photonic integrated circuits have
revived interest in parametric amplifiers due to the significantly increased
nonlinearity in various integrated platforms. Yet, despite major progress,
continuous-wave-pumped parametric amplifiers built on photonic chips have to
date remained out of reach. Here we demonstrate a chip-based travelling-wave
optical parametric amplifier with net signal gain in the continuous-wave
regime. Using ultralow-loss, dispersion-engineered, meter-long, silicon nitride
photonic integrated circuits that are tightly coiled on a photonic chip, we
achieve a continuous parametric gain of 12 dB that exceeds both the on-chip
optical propagation loss and fiber-chip-fiber coupling losses in the optical
C-band.

exploration, using jointly their senses of vision and touch. However, in 3D
shape reconstruction, most recent progress has relied on static datasets of
limited sensory data such as RGB images, depth maps or haptic readings, leaving
the active exploration of the shape largely unexplored. Inactive touch sensing
for 3D reconstruction, the goal is to actively select the tactile readings that
maximize the improvement in shape reconstruction accuracy. However, the
development of deep learning-based active touch models is largely limited by
the lack of frameworks for shape exploration. In this paper, we focus on this
problem and introduce a system composed of: 1) a haptic simulator leveraging
high spatial resolution vision-based tactile sensors for active touching of 3D
objects; 2)a mesh-based 3D shape reconstruction model that relies on tactile or
visuotactile signals; and 3) a set of data-driven solutions with either tactile
or visuotactile priors to guide the shape exploration. Our framework enables
the development of the first fully data-driven solutions to active touch on top
of learned models for object understanding. Our experiments show the benefits
of such solutions in the task of 3D shape understanding where our models
consistently outperform natural baselines. We provide our framework as a tool
to foster future research in this direction.

with variation of successful genotype-phenotypes. My treatment emphasized the
potential influence of the biotic and abiotic environment, and of the laws of
physics/chemistry, on each of these processes. I demonstrated the conditions
under which these processes can allow for ongoing exploration of a space of
possible phenotypes (which I labelled exploratory open-endedness). However,
these processes by themselves cannot expand the space of possible phenotypes
and therefore cannot account for the more interesting and unexpected kinds of
evolutionary innovation (such as those I labelled expansive and
transformational open-endedness). In the previous work I looked at ways in
which expansive and transformational innovations could arise. I proposed
transdomain bridges and non-additive compositional systems as two mechanisms by
which these kinds of innovations could arise. In the current paper I wish to
generalise and expand upon these two concepts. I do this by adopting the

interpretation of the tensors in the canonical tensor model (CTM) of quantum
gravity. In order to understand the stability of this interpretation, it is
important to be able to estimate how many tensor rank decompositions can
approximate a given tensor. More precisely, finding an approximate symmetric
tensor rank decomposition of a symmetric tensor $Q$ with an error allowance
$\Delta$ is to find vectors $\phi^i$ satisfying $\|Q-\sum_{i=1}^R \phi^i\otimes
\phi^i\cdots \otimes \phi^i\|^2 \leq \Delta$. The volume of all possible such
$\phi^i$ is an interesting quantity which measures the amount of possible
decompositions for a tensor $Q$ within an allowance. While it would be
difficult to evaluate this quantity for each $Q$, we find an explicit formula
for a similar quantity by integrating over all $Q$ of unit norm. The expression
as a function of $\Delta$ is given by the product of a hypergeometric function
and a power function. We also extend the formula to generic decompositions of
non-symmetric tensors. The derivation depends on the existence (convergence) of
the partition function of a matrix model which appeared in the context of the

separate treatment-effect models (TE-ML) for remdesivir, corticosteroids,

chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. 2390 admissions from 2 additional health
departments were reserved as an independent test to analyze retrospectively the
survival benefits of therapies in the population selected by the TE-ML models

treatment propensity scores to control for pre-treatment confounding variables
associated to outcome and further evaluated for futility. ML architecture was
based on boosted decision-trees. Results: In the populations identified by the
TE-ML models, only Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were significantly associated

0.21 (P = 0.001), respectively. No survival benefits from chloroquine
derivatives, lopinavir-ritonavir and azithromycin were demonstrated. Tools to
explain the predictions of TE-ML models are explored at patient-level as
potential tools for personalized decision making and precision medicine.
Conclusion: ML methods are suitable tools toward RWE analysis of COVID-19

extension of the $f(Q)$ and $f(Q,T)$ gravity theories. The action involves an
arbitrary function of the non-metricity $Q$ and $T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$ in the
gravity Lagrangian. The field equations for the theory are derived in the
metric-affine formalism by varying the action with respect to the metric. The
theory involves a non-minimal coupling between the geometric and the matter
sectors, and hence the covariant divergence of the energy-momentum tensor is
non-zero, thus implying the non-conservation of the same. The vacuum solutions
of the theory are investigated and it is found that the theory perfectly admits
a de-Sitter-like evolution of the universe. The cosmological equations are
derived and it is found that there are two correction terms arising as
modification of the gravity. Two specific toy models of the form $Q+\eta
\left(\textbf{T}^2\right)^{n}$ and $f_{0}Q^{m} \left(\textbf{T}^2\right)^{n}$
are explored to gain further insights into the dynamics of the theory. It is
seen that the field equations of both the models have terms similar to those
arising from the quantum gravity effects and are thus responsible for the
avoidance of singularity. One striking feature of the model is that the
non-linear correction terms dominate in the early universe and gradually fade
away at later times giving the standard FLRW universe. Solutions for the FLRW
equations are found wherever possible and the evolution of the scale factor and
the matter-energy density are plotted. Finally, the energy conditions are
explored in the background of the theory. Using these conditions and some
observational data the theory is considerably constrained.

technology, aiming at improving the quality of people's lives. Many research
works focus on future smart cities with a holistic approach towards smart city
development. In this paper, we introduce such future smart cities that leverage
blockchain technology in areas like data security, energy and waste management,
governance, transport, supply chain, including emergency events, and
environmental monitoring. Blockchain, being a decentralized immutable ledger,
has the potential to promote the development of smart cities by guaranteeing
transparency, data security, interoperability, and privacy. Particularly, using
blockchain in emergency events will provide interoperability between many
parties involved in the response, will increase timeliness of services, and
establish transparency. In that case, if a current fee-based or
first-come-first-serve-based processing is used, emergency events may get
delayed in being processed due to competition, and thus, threatening people's
lives. Thus, there is a need for transaction prioritization based on the
priority of information and quick creation of blocks (variable interval block
creation mechanism). Also, since the leaders ensure transaction prioritization
while generating blocks, leader rotation and proper election procedure become
important for the transaction prioritization process to take place honestly and
efficiently. In our consensus protocol, we deploy a machine learning (ML)
algorithm to achieve efficient leader election and design a novel dynamic block
creation algorithm. Also, to ensure honest assessment from the followers on the
blocks generated by the leaders, a peer-prediction-based verification mechanism
is proposed. Both security analysis and simulation experiments are carried out
to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our proposed scheme.

estimations on the energy consumption of Bitcoin miners. However, most of the
studies are focused on estimating energy consumption, not in exploring the
factors that determine it.
  Goal: To explore the factors that determine maximum energy consumption of
Bitcoin miners. In particular, analyze the limits of energy consumption, and to
which extent variations of the factors could produce its reduction.
  Method: Estimate the overall profit of all Bitcoin miners during a certain
period of time, and the costs (including energy) that they face during that
time, because of the mining activity. The underlying assumptions is that miners
will only consume energy to mine Bitcoin if they have the expectation of
profit, and at the same time they are competitive with respect of each other.
Therefore, they will operate as a group in the point where profits balance
expenditures.
  Results: We show a basic equation that determines energy consumption based on
some specific factors: minting, transaction fees, exchange rate, energy price,
and amortization cost. We also define the Amortization Factor, which can be
computed for mining devices based on their cost and energy consumption, helps
to understand how the cost of equipment influences total energy consumption.
  Conclusions: The factors driving energy consumption are identified, and from
them, some ways in which Bitcoin energy consumption could be reduced are
discussed. Some of these ways do not reduce the most important properties of
Bitcoin, such as the chances of control of the aggregated hashpower, or the
fundamentals of the proof of work mechanism. In general, the methods presented
can help to predict energy consumption in different scenarios, based on factors
that can be calculated from available data, or assumed in scenarios.

materials within a design domain by minimizing a cost function, subject to some
performance constraints. Robust topology optimization (RTO) also incorporates
the effect of input uncertainties and produces a design with the best average
performance of the structure while reducing the response sensitivity to input
uncertainties. It is computationally expensive to carry out RTO using finite
element and Monte Carlo sampling. In this work, we use neural network
surrogates to enable a faster solution approach via surrogate-based
optimization and build a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to transform the the
high dimensional design space into a low dimensional one. Furthermore, finite
element solvers will be replaced by a neural network surrogate. Also, to
further facilitate the design exploration, we limit our search to a subspace,
which consists of designs that are solutions to deterministic topology
optimization problems under different realizations of input uncertainties. With
these neural network approximations, a gradient-based optimization approach is
formed to minimize the predicted objective function over the low dimensional
design subspace. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on
two compliance minimization problems and show that VAE performs well on
learning the features of the design from minimal training data, and that
converting the design space into a low dimensional latent space makes the
problem computationally efficient. The resulting gradient-based optimization
algorithm produces optimal designs with lower robust compliances than those
observed in the training set.

new dimension in which the pandemic is affecting the scientific workforce: the
rate of initiating new research projects. Except for the small fraction of
scientists who directly engaged in COVID-related research, most scientists
started significantly fewer new research projects in 2020. This decline is most
pronounced amongst the same demographic groups of scientists who reported the
largest initial disruptions: female scientists and those with young children.
Yet in sharp contrast to the earlier phase of the pandemic, when there were
large disparities across scientific fields, this loss of new projects appears
remarkably homogeneous across fields. Analyses of large-scale publication data
reveal a global decline in the rate of new collaborations, especially in
non-COVID-related preprints, which is consistent with the reported decline in

safety, security, and access. However, there is a need to connect and embed the
ethical and technical aspects in the design. Using a case-study of a research
and development project focused on the use of CAI in storytelling for children,
this paper reflects on the social context within a specific case of technology
development, as substantiated and supported by argumentation from within the
literature. It describes the decision making process behind the recommendations
made on this case for their adoption in the creative industries. Further
research that engages with developers and stakeholders in the ethics of
storytelling through CAI is highlighted as a matter of urgency.

  of Gender, Nationality, and Socio-economic Status",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Women, visible minorities, and other socially disadvantaged groups continue
to be underrepresented in STEM education. Understanding students' motivations
for pursuing a STEM major, and the roles gender, nationality, parental
education attainment, and socio-economic background play in shaping students'
motivations can support the design of more effective recruitment efforts
towards these groups. In this paper, we propose and develop a novel text mining
approach incorporating the Latent Dirichlet Allocation and word embeddings to
analyze applicants' motivational factors for choosing an engineering program.
We apply the proposed method to a dataset of 43,645 applications to the
engineering school of a large Canadian university. We then investigate the
relationship between applicants' gender, nationality, and family income and
educational attainment, and their stated motivations for applying to their
engineering program of choice. We find that interest in technology and the
desire to make social impact are the two most powerful motivators for
applicants. Additionally, while we find significant motivational differences
related to applicants' nationality and family socio-economic status, gender has
the strongest and the most robust impact on students' motivations for studying
engineering.

not only produces better prediction performance, but, more importantly,
improves the model's `clinical trustworthiness' and model
stability/reliability.

to focus on a more pragmatic or naturalistic account of understanding, that is,
whether the stakeholders understand the explanation. This point is especially
important for research on evaluation methods for XAI systems. Thus, another
direction where XAI research can benefit significantly from cognitive science
and psychology research is ways to measure understanding of users, responses
and attitudes. These measures can be used to quantify explanation quality and
as feedback to the XAI system to improve the explanations. The current report
aims to propose suitable metrics for evaluating XAI systems from the
perspective of the cognitive states and processes of stakeholders. We elaborate
on 7 dimensions, i.e., goodness, satisfaction, user understanding, curiosity &
engagement, trust & reliance, controllability & interactivity, and learning
curve & productivity, together with the recommended subjective and objective
psychological measures. We then provide more details about how we can use the
recommended measures to evaluate a visual classification XAI system according
to the recommended cognitive metrics.

challenges for making accurate predictions and quantifying uncertainty. We
build upon recent work and show that architectures for multi-attribute
prediction can be reinterpreted as energy-based models (EBMs). While existing
EBM approaches achieve strong discriminative performance, they are unable to
generate samples conditioned on novel attribute combinations. We propose a
simple extension which expands the capabilities of EBMs to generating accurate
conditional samples. Our approach, combined with newly developed techniques in
energy-based model training, allows us to directly maximize the likelihood of
data and labels under the unnormalized joint distribution. We evaluate our
proposed approach on high-dimensional image data with high-dimensional binary
attribute labels. We find our models are capable of both accurate, calibrated
predictions and high-quality conditional synthesis of novel attribute
combinations.

broadband absorption of dielectric metamaterial, which is achieved by
combination of genetic algorithm and simulation platform. A multi-layered
metamaterial absorber with an ultra-broadband absorption from 5.3 to 18 GHz (a
relative bandwidth of as high as 109%) is realized numerically and
experimentally. In addition, simulated results demonstrate the proposed
metamaterial exhibits good incident angle and polarization tolerance, which
also are significant criteria for practical applications. By investigating the
working principle with theoretical calculation and numerical simulation, it can
be found that merging of multiple resonance modes encompassing
quarter-wavelength interference cancellation, spoof surface plasmon polariton
mode, dielectric resonance mode and grating mode is responsible for a
remarkable ultra-broadband absorption. Analysis of respective contribution of
material and structure indicates that either of them plays an indispensable
role in activating different resonance modes, and symphony of material and
structure is essential to afford desirable target performance. The
material-structure integrated design philosophy highlights the superiority of
coupling material and structure and provides an effective comprehensive
optimization strategy for dielectric metamaterials.

multiplicatory relationship with one another. In addition, each of these

designs a holistic independent ethical assessment process for a text

The assessment is further augmented with protected attributes mining and
counterfactual-based analysis to enhance bias assessment. It covers assessments
of technical performance, data bias, embedding bias, classification bias, and
interpretability. The proposed process is demonstrated through an assessment of
