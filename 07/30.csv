Research 4, 013091 (2022)","10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.013091",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a protocol for encoding $N$ real numbers stored in $N$ memory
registers into the amplitudes of the quantum superposition that describes the
state of $\log_2N$ qubits. This task is one of the main steps in quantum
machine learning algorithms applied to classical data. The protocol combines
partial CNOT gate rotations with probabilistic projection onto the desired
state. The number of additional ancilla qubits used during the implementation
of the protocol, as well as the number of quantum gates, scale linearly with
the number of qubits in the processing register and hence logarithmically with
$N$. The average time needed to successfully perform the encoding scales
logarithmically with the number of qubits, in addition to being inversely
proportional to the acceptable error in the encoded amplitudes. It also depends
on the structure of the data set in such a way that the protocol is most
efficient for non-sparse data.

strongly enhanced by the penetration of the dry adiabat into the optically thin

with Newton's problem of minimal resistance, which is concerned with the maxima
or minima of integral functionals. Finding the solution of such problems leads
to solving the associated Euler-Lagrange equations. The subject has found many
applications over the centuries, e.g., in physics, economics, engineering and
biology. Up to this moment, however, the theory of the calculus of variations
has been confined to Newton's approach to calculus. As in many applications
negative values of admissible functions are not physically plausible, we
propose here to develop an alternative calculus of variations based on the
non-Newtonian approach first introduced by Grossman and Katz in the period
between 1967 and 1970, which provides a calculus defined, from the very
beginning, for positive real numbers only, and it is based on a (non-Newtonian)
derivative that permits one to compare relative changes between a dependent
positive variable and an independent variable that is also positive. In this
way, the non-Newtonian calculus of variations we introduce here provides a
natural framework for problems involving functions with positive images. Our
main result is a first-order optimality condition of Euler-Lagrange type. The
new calculus of variations complements the standard one in a
nontrivial/multiplicative way, guaranteeing that the solution remains in the
physically admissible positive range. An illustrative example is given.

the massive collection of annotated data which is expensive and time-consuming.
To lower the cost of data annotation, active learning has been proposed to
interactively query an oracle to annotate a small proportion of informative
samples in an unlabeled dataset. Inspired by the fact that the samples with
higher loss are usually more informative to the model than the samples with
lower loss, in this paper we present a novel deep active learning approach that
queries the oracle for data annotation when the unlabeled sample is believed to
incorporate high loss. The core of our approach is a measurement Temporal
Output Discrepancy (TOD) that estimates the sample loss by evaluating the
discrepancy of outputs given by models at different optimization steps. Our
theoretical investigation shows that TOD lower-bounds the accumulated sample
loss thus it can be used to select informative unlabeled samples. On basis of
TOD, we further develop an effective unlabeled data sampling strategy as well
as an unsupervised learning criterion that enhances model performance by
incorporating the unlabeled data. Due to the simplicity of TOD, our active
learning approach is efficient, flexible, and task-agnostic. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
performances than the state-of-the-art active learning methods on image
classification and semantic segmentation tasks.

credibility of online platforms. This phenomenon is particularly evident during
crucial political events, as political elections. In the present paper, we

particular, we focus on the polarised discussion about Brexit on Twitter
analysing a data set made of more than 10 million tweets posted for over a
month. We found that the presence of automated accounts fostered the debate
particularly in the days before the UK national elections, in which we find a
steep increase of bots in the discussion; in the days after the election day,
their incidence returned to values similar to the ones observed few weeks
before the elections. On the other hand, we found that the number of suspended
users (i.e. accounts that were removed by the platform for some violation of
the Twitter policy) remained constant until the election day, after which it
reached significantly higher values. Remarkably, after the TV debate between
Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, we observed the injection of a large number of
novel bots whose behaviour is markedly different from that of pre-existing
ones. Finally, we explored the bots' stance, finding that their activity is
spread across the whole political spectrum, although in different proportions,
and we studied the different usage of hashtags by automated accounts and
suspended users, thus targeting the formation of common narratives in different
sides of the debate.

a database significantly larger than that used here would likely be required.
Shifting a focus from regression to categorization models learning from
characteristic temperatures can be used to weakly distinguish glasses likely to
be above vs. below our database's median $D_{max}$ value of 4.0 $mm$, with a
mean F1 score of $0.77 \pm 0.02$ for this categorization. The overall weak
results on predicting $D_{max}$ suggests that critical cooling rate might be a

applications such as driver assistance systems. Monocular 3D detection, as a
representative general setting among image-based approaches, provides a more
economical solution than conventional settings relying on LiDARs but still
yields unsatisfactory results. This paper first presents a systematic study on
this problem. We observe that the current monocular 3D detection can be
simplified as an instance depth estimation problem: The inaccurate instance
depth blocks all the other 3D attribute predictions from improving the overall
detection performance. Moreover, recent methods directly estimate the depth
based on isolated instances or pixels while ignoring the geometric relations
across different objects. To this end, we construct geometric relation graphs
across predicted objects and use the graph to facilitate depth estimation. As
the preliminary depth estimation of each instance is usually inaccurate in this
ill-posed setting, we incorporate a probabilistic representation to capture the
uncertainty. It provides an important indicator to identify confident
predictions and further guide the depth propagation. Despite the simplicity of
the basic idea, our method, PGD, obtains significant improvements on KITTI and
nuScenes benchmarks, achieving 1st place out of all monocular vision-only
methods while still maintaining real-time efficiency. Code and models will be

incompatibility in quantum measurements. Together with the Shannon entropy, few
families of parametrized entropies have found use in various questions. It is
also known that a possibility to vary the parameter can often provide more
restrictions on elements of probability distributions. In quantum information
processing, one often deals with measurements having some special structure.
Quantum designs are currently the subject of active research, whence the aim to
formulate complementarity relations for related measurements occurs. Using
generalized entropies of order $\alpha\in(0,2)$, we obtain uncertainty and
certainty relations for POVMs assigned to a quantum design. The structure of
quantum designs leads to several restrictions on generated probabilities. We
show how to convert these restrictions into two-sided entropic estimates. One
of the used ways is based on truncated expansions of the Taylor type. The
recently found method to get two-sided entropic estimates uses polynomials with
flexible coefficients. We illustrate the utility of this method with respect to
both the R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies. Possible applications of the derived

wiretap (MAC-WT) channels where, besides confidential messages, the users have
also open messages to transmit. All these messages are intended for the
legitimate receiver (or Bob for brevity) but only the confidential messages
need to be protected from the eavesdropper (Eve). We first consider a discrete
memoryless (DM) MAC-WT channel where both Bob and Eve jointly decode their
interested messages. By using random coding, we find an achievable rate region,
within which perfect secrecy can be realized, i.e., all users can communicate
with Bob with arbitrarily small probability of error, while the confidential
information leaked to Eve tends to zero. Due to the high implementation
complexity of joint decoding, we also consider the DM MAC-WT channel where Bob
simply decodes messages independently while Eve still applies joint decoding.
We then extend the results in the DM case to a Gaussian vector (GV) MAC-WT
channel. Based on the information theoretic results, we further maximize the
sum secrecy rate of the GV MAC-WT system by designing precoders for all users.
Since the problems are non-convex, we provide iterative algorithms to obtain
suboptimal solutions. Simulation results show that compared with existing
schemes, secure communication can be greatly enhanced by the proposed
algorithms, and in contrast to the works which only focus on the network
secrecy performance, the system spectrum efficiency can be effectively improved
since open messages can be simultaneously transmitted.

singlets with a global non-Abelian flavor symmetry
$\mathcal{Q}_6\times\mathcal{Z}_2$. This discrete group accounts for the
observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles after spontaneous symmetry
breaking. In this scenario only the third generation of fermions get their
masses as in the Standard Model (SM). The masses of the remaining fermions are
generated through a seesaw-like mechanism. To that end, the matter content of
the model is enlarged by introducing electrically charged vector-like fermions
(VLFs), right handed Majorana neutrinos and several SM scalar singlets. Here we
study the processes involving VLFs that are within the reach of the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). We perform collider studies for vector-like leptons
(VLLs) and vector-like quarks (VLQs), focusing on double production channels
for both cases, while for VLLs single production topologies are also included.
Utilizing genetic algorithms for neural network optimization, we determine the
statistical significance for a hypothetical discovery at future LHC runs. In
particular, we show that we can not safely exclude VLLs for masses greater than
$200~\mathrm{GeV}$. For VLQ's in our model, we show that we can probe their
masses up to 3.8 TeV, if we take only into account the high-luminosity phase of
the LHC. Considering Run-III luminosities, we can also exclude VLQs for masses
up to $3.4~\mathrm{TeV}$. We also show how the model with predicted VLL masses
accommodates the muon anomalous magnetic moment.

spatio-temporal dynamics such as mesoscale turbulence. Since the Reynolds
number of microscopic flows is very small on the scale of individual agents,
inertial effects are typically excluded in continuum theories of active nematic
turbulence. Whether active stresses can collectively excite inertial flows is
currently unclear. To address this question, we investigate a two-dimensional
continuum theory for active nematic turbulence. In particular, we compare
mesoscale turbulence with and without the effects of advective inertia. We find
that inertial effects can influence the flow already close to the onset of the
turbulent state and, moreover, give rise to large-scale fluid motion for strong
active driving. A detailed analysis of the kinetic energy budget reveals an
energy transfer to large scales mediated by inertial advection. While this
transfer is small in comparison to energy injection and dissipation, its
effects accumulate over time. The inclusion of friction, which is typically
present in experiments, can compensate for this effect. The findings suggest
that the inclusion of inertia and friction may be necessary for dynamically
consistent theories of active nematic turbulence.

to be before it begins to behave differently from a self-avoiding walk on

function for $n$-step weakly self-avoiding walk is known to be asymptotically
purely exponential, of the form $A\mu^n$, where $\mu$ is the growth constant
for weakly self-avoiding walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We prove the identical
asymptotic behaviour $A\mu^n$ on the torus (with the same $A$ and $\mu$ as on

least $V^{1/2}$ before it ""feels"" the torus in its leading asymptotics. Our
results support the conjecture that the behaviour of the partition function

critical scaling window which separates the dilute phase $n \ll V^{1/2}$ from
the dense phase $n \gg V^{1/2}$. To prove the conjecture and to establish the

high-dimensional linear regression. Constructing an approximately unbiased
estimate of the parameter of interest is a crucial step towards performing
statistical inference. Several authors suggest to orthogonalize both the
variable of interest and the outcome with respect to the nuisance variables,
and then regress the residual outcome with respect to the residual variable.
This is possible if the covariance structure of the regressors is perfectly
known, or is sufficiently structured that it can be estimated accurately from
data (e.g., the precision matrix is sufficiently sparse).
  Here we consider a regime in which the covariate model can only be estimated
inaccurately, and hence existing debiasing approaches are not guaranteed to
work. When errors in estimating the covariate model are correlated with errors
in estimating the linear model parameter, an incomplete elimination of the bias
occurs. We propose the Correlation Adjusted Debiased Lasso (CAD), which nearly
eliminates this bias in some cases, including cases in which the estimation
errors are neither negligible nor orthogonal.
  We consider a setting in which some unlabeled samples might be available to
the statistician alongside labeled ones (semi-supervised learning), and our
guarantees hold under the assumption of jointly Gaussian covariates. The new
debiased estimator is guaranteed to cancel the bias in two cases: (1) when the
total number of samples (labeled and unlabeled) is larger than the number of
parameters, or (2) when the covariance of the nuisance (but not the effect of
the nuisance on the variable of interest) is known. Neither of these cases is
treated by state-of-the-art methods.

will propagate into processes such as abdominal organ segmentation and dilute
the results in population-based analyses. There is a clear need for a fast and
robust method to accurately separate fat and water channels. In this work we
propose such a method based on style transfer using a conditional generative
adversarial network. We also introduce a new Dixon loss function for the
generator model. Using data from the UK Biobank Dixon MRI, our model is able to
predict highly accurate fat and water channels that are free from artifacts. We
show that the model separates fat and water channels using either single input
(in-phase) or dual input (in-phase and opposed-phase), with the latter
producing improved results. Our proposed method enables faster and more
accurate downstream analysis of body composition from Dixon MRI in population
studies by eliminating the need for visual inspection or discarding data due to
fat-water swaps.

efficient and extensible path for significant promotion of QRNG generation
rate. During this process, real-time randomness extraction using information
theoretically secure randomness extractors is vital, because it plays critical
role in the limit of throughput rate and implementation cost of QRNGs. In this
work, we investigate parallel and real-time realization of several
Toeplitz-hashing extractors within one field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for
parallel QRNG. Elaborate layout of Toeplitz matrixes and efficient utilization
of hardware computing resource in the FPGA are emphatically studied. Logic
source occupation for different scale and quantity of Toeplitz matrices is
analyzed and two-layer parallel pipeline algorithm is delicately designed to
fully exploit the parallel algorithm advantage and hardware source of the FPGA.
This work finally achieves a real-time post-processing rate of QRNG above 8

quantum sideband modes of vacuum state, our demonstration shows an important
step towards chip-based parallel QRNG, which could effectively improve the
practicality of CV QRNGs, including device trusted, device-independent, and

scene graphs to represent the relations of objects in the image. The current
captioning encoders generally use a Graph Convolutional Net (GCN) to represent
the relation information and merge it with the object region features via
concatenation or convolution to get the final input for sentence decoding.
However, the GCN-based encoders in the existing methods are less effective for
captioning due to two reasons. First, using the image captioning as the
objective (i.e., Maximum Likelihood Estimation) rather than a relation-centric
loss cannot fully explore the potential of the encoder. Second, using a
pre-trained model instead of the encoder itself to extract the relationships is
not flexible and cannot contribute to the explainability of the model. To
improve the quality of image captioning, we propose a novel architecture
ReFormer -- a RElational transFORMER to generate features with relation
information embedded and to explicitly express the pair-wise relationships
between objects in the image. ReFormer incorporates the objective of scene
graph generation with that of image captioning using one modified Transformer
model. This design allows ReFormer to generate not only better image captions

scene graphs to explicitly describe the pair-wise relation-ships. Experiments

enablers for immersive visual communication. The coding process of dynamic
point clouds, especially video-based point cloud compression (V-PCC) developed
by the MPEG standardization group, is now delivering state-of-the-art
performance in compression efficiency. V-PCC is based on the projection of the
point cloud patches to 2D planes and encoding the sequence as 2D texture and
geometry patch sequences. However, the resulting quantization errors from
coding can introduce compression artifacts, which can be very unpleasant for
the quality of experience (QoE). In this work, we developed a novel
out-of-the-loop point cloud geometry artifact removal solution that can
significantly improve reconstruction quality without additional bandwidth cost.
Our novel framework consists of a point cloud sampling scheme, an artifact
removal network, and an aggregation scheme. The point cloud sampling scheme
employs a cube-based neighborhood patch extraction to divide the point cloud
into patches. The geometry artifact removal network then processes these
patches to obtain artifact-removed patches. The artifact-removed patches are
then merged together using an aggregation scheme to obtain the final
artifact-removed point cloud. We employ 3D deep convolutional feature learning
for geometry artifact removal that jointly recovers both the quantization
direction and the quantization noise level by exploiting projection and
quantization prior. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
is highly effective and can considerably improve the quality of the

understood within Lagrangian mechanics, their impact on quantum channels has a
range of open questions. The theory of asymmetry grew out of
information-theoretic work on entanglement and quantum reference frames, and
allows us to quantify the degree to which a quantum system encodes coordinates
of a symmetry group. Recently, a complete set of entropic conditions was found
for asymmetry in terms of correlations relative to infinitely many quantum
reference frames. However, these conditions are difficult to use in practice
and their physical implications unclear. In the present theoretical work, we
show that this set of conditions has extensive redundancy, and one can restrict
to reference frames forming any closed surface in the state space that has the
maximally mixed state in its interior. This in turn implies that asymmetry can
be reduced to just a single entropic condition evaluated at the maximally mixed
state. Contrary to intuition, this shows that we do not need macroscopic,
classical reference frames to determine the asymmetry properties of a quantum
system, but instead infinitesimally small frames suffice. Building on this
analysis, we provide simple, closed conditions to estimate the minimal
depolarization needed to make a given quantum state accessible under channels
covariant with any given symmetry group.

attacking an unknown model, which facilitates adversarial attacks in more
practical scenarios, e.g., black-box attacks. Existing transferable attacks
tend to craft adversarial examples by indiscriminately distorting features to
degrade prediction accuracy in a source model without aware of intrinsic
features of objects in the images. We argue that such brute-force degradation
would introduce model-specific local optimum into adversarial examples, thus
limiting the transferability. By contrast, we propose the Feature
Importance-aware Attack (FIA), which disrupts important object-aware features
that dominate model decisions consistently. More specifically, we obtain
feature importance by introducing the aggregate gradient, which averages the
gradients with respect to feature maps of the source model, computed on a batch
of random transforms of the original clean image. The gradients will be highly
correlated to objects of interest, and such correlation presents invariance
across different models. Besides, the random transforms will preserve intrinsic
features of objects and suppress model-specific information. Finally, the
feature importance guides to search for adversarial examples towards disrupting
critical features, achieving stronger transferability. Extensive experimental
evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the
proposed FIA, i.e., improving the success rate by 9.5% against normally trained
models and 12.8% against defense models as compared to the state-of-the-art
transferable attacks. Code is available at: https://github.com/hcguoO0/FIA

  learning",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Structural concept complexity, class overlap, and data scarcity are some of
the most important factors influencing the performance of classifiers under
class imbalance conditions. When these effects were uncovered in the early
2000s, understandably, the classifiers on which they were demonstrated belonged
to the classical rather than Deep Learning categories of approaches. As Deep
Learning is gaining ground over classical machine learning and is beginning to
be used in critical applied settings, it is important to assess systematically
how well they respond to the kind of challenges their classical counterparts
have struggled with in the past two decades. The purpose of this paper is to
study the behavior of deep learning systems in settings that have previously
been deemed challenging to classical machine learning systems to find out
whether the depth of the systems is an asset in such settings. The results in
both artificial and real-world image datasets (MNIST Fashion, CIFAR-10) show
that these settings remain mostly challenging for Deep Learning systems and
that deeper architectures seem to help with structural concept complexity but
not with overlap challenges in simple artificial domains. Data scarcity is not
overcome by deeper layers, either. In the real-world image domains, where
overfitting is a greater concern than in the artificial domains, the advantage
of deeper architectures is less obvious: while it is observed in certain cases,
it is quickly cancelled as models get deeper and perform worse than their
shallower counterparts.

any divergences, but splits into two disconnected components, without and with
CTCs, which are joined only through the boundary; then, passages across the
chronology horizon are impossible for any field excitations. In dual terms, the
strong self-interaction of the CFT decouples the pathological part from the
rest of the spacetime. We also find that entangling the CFTs in two separate
time machines connects them through a traversable bulk wormhole. Nevertheless,
any entanglement-assisted chronology violations will be prevented by quantum
bulk corrections, i.e., subleading 1/N effects, again without needing any
gravitational backreaction of the CFT. We are led to speculate that chronology

largely excluded Web Audio API-based fingerprinting in their analysis. We
address this issue by conducting the first systematic study of effectiveness of
web audio fingerprinting mechanisms. We focus on studying the feasibility and
diversity properties of web audio fingerprinting. Along with 3 known audio
fingerprinting vectors, we designed and implemented 4 new audio fingerprint
vectors that work by obtaining FFTs of waveforms generated via different
methods. Our study analyzed audio fingerprints from 2093 web users and presents
new insights into the nature of Web Audio fingerprints. First, we show that
audio fingeprinting vectors, unlike other prior vectors, reveal an apparent
fickleness with some users' browsers giving away differing fingerprints in
repeated attempts. However, we show that it is possible to devise a graph-based
analysis mechanism to collectively consider all the different fingerprints of
users and thus craft a stable fingerprinting mechanism. Our analysis also shows
that it is possible to do this in a timely fashion.
  Next, we investigate the diversity of audio fingerprints and compare this
with prior techniques. Our results show that audio fingerprints are much less
diverse than other vectors with only 95 distinct fingerprints among 2093 users.
At the same time, further analysis shows that web audio fingerprinting can
potentially bring considerable additive value (in terms of entropy) to existing
fingerprinting mechanisms. We also show that our results contradict the current
security and privacy recommendations provided by W3C regarding audio
fingerprinting. Overall, our systematic study allows browser developers to
gauge the degree of privacy invasion presented by audio fingerprinting thus
helping them take a more informed stance when designing privacy protection

bias between training and deployment environments is ignored. Hence, we propose
a counterfactual analysis method for human trajectory prediction to investigate
the causality between the predicted trajectories and input clues and alleviate
the negative effects brought by environment bias. We first build a causal graph
for trajectory forecasting with history trajectory, future trajectory, and the
environment interactions. Then, we cut off the inference from environment to
trajectory by constructing the counterfactual intervention on the trajectory
itself. Finally, we compare the factual and counterfactual trajectory clues to
alleviate the effects of environment bias and highlight the trajectory clues.
Our counterfactual analysis is a plug-and-play module that can be applied to
any baseline prediction methods including RNN- and CNN-based ones. We show that

Efficiently Assessing Machine Learning API Shifts",,,,,"stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning (ML) prediction APIs are increasingly widely used. An ML API
can change over time due to model updates or retraining. This presents a key
challenge in the usage of the API because it is often not clear to the user if
and how the ML model has changed. Model shifts can affect downstream
application performance and also create oversight issues (e.g. if consistency
is desired). In this paper, we initiate a systematic investigation of ML API
shifts. We first quantify the performance shifts from 2020 to 2021 of popular
ML APIs from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others on a variety of datasets. We
identified significant model shifts in 12 out of 36 cases we investigated.
Interestingly, we found several datasets where the API's predictions became
significantly worse over time. This motivated us to formulate the API shift
assessment problem at a more fine-grained level as estimating how the API
model's confusion matrix changes over time when the data distribution is
constant. Monitoring confusion matrix shifts using standard random sampling can
require a large number of samples, which is expensive as each API call costs a
fee. We propose a principled adaptive sampling algorithm, MASA, to efficiently
estimate confusion matrix shifts. MASA can accurately estimate the confusion
matrix shifts in commercial ML APIs using up to 90% fewer samples compared to
random sampling. This work establishes ML API shifts as an important problem to
study and provides a cost-effective approach to monitor such shifts.

metrics and in restricted classes, perhaps most notably in low-dimensional
Euclidean spaces -- due to their numerous applications. Euclidean spanners can
be viewed as means of compressing the $\binom{n}{2}$ pairwise distances of a
$d$-dimensional Euclidean space into $O(n) = O_{\epsilon,d}(n)$ spanner edges,
so that the spanner distances preserve the original distances to within a
factor of $1+\epsilon$, for any $\epsilon > 0$. Moreover, one can compute such
spanners in optimal $O(n \log n)$ time. Once the spanner has been computed, it
serves as a ""proxy"" overlay network, on which the computation can proceed,
which gives rise to huge savings in space and other important quality measures.
  On the negative side, by working on the spanner rather than the original
metric, one loses the key property of being able to efficiently ""navigate""
between pairs of points. While in the original metric, one can go from any
point to any other via a direct edge, it is unclear how to efficiently navigate
in the spanner: How can we translate the existence of a ""good"" path into an
efficient algorithm finding it? Moreover, usually by ""good"" path we mean a path
whose weight approximates the original distance between its endpoints -- but a
priori the number of edges (or ""hops"") in the path could be huge. To control
the hop-length of paths, one can try to upper bound the spanner's hop-diameter,
but naturally bounded hop-diameter spanners are more complex than spanners with
unbounded hop-diameter, which might render the algorithmic task of efficiently
finding good paths more challenging.
  The original metric enables us to navigate optimally -- a single hop (for any

This pipeline makes use of a detailed modelling of the halo mass function in
$f(R)$ gravity, which is based on the spherical collapse model and calibrated
by simulations, and fully accounts for the effects of the fifth force on the
dynamical mass, the halo concentration and the observable-mass scaling
relations. Using a set of mock cluster catalogues observed through the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, we demonstrate that this pipeline, which constrains
the present-day background scalar field $f_{R0}$, performs very well for both
$\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ fiducial cosmologies. We find that using an incomplete
treatment of the scaling relation, which could deviate from the usual power-law
behaviour in $f(R)$ gravity, can lead to imprecise and biased constraints. We
also find that various degeneracies between the modified gravity, cosmological
and scaling relation parameters can significantly affect the constraints, and
show how this can be rectified by using tighter priors and better knowledge of
the cosmological and scaling relation parameters. Our pipeline can be easily
extended to other modified gravity models, to test gravity on large scales

al., 2018) allow agents to learn rich repertoires of behavior in the absence of
extrinsic rewards. They work by simultaneously training a policy to produce
distinguishable latent-conditioned trajectories, and a discriminator to
evaluate distinguishability by trying to infer latents from trajectories. The
hope is for the agent to explore and master the environment by encouraging each
skill (latent) to reliably reach different states. However, an inherent
exploration problem lingers: when a novel state is actually encountered, the
discriminator will necessarily not have seen enough training data to produce
accurate and confident skill classifications, leading to low intrinsic reward
for the agent and effective penalization of the sort of exploration needed to
actually maximize the objective. To combat this inherent pessimism towards
exploration, we derive an information gain auxiliary objective that involves
training an ensemble of discriminators and rewarding the policy for their
disagreement. Our objective directly estimates the epistemic uncertainty that
comes from the discriminator not having seen enough training examples, thus
providing an intrinsic reward more tailored to the true objective compared to
pseudocount-based methods (Burda et al., 2019). We call this exploration bonus
discriminator disagreement intrinsic reward, or DISDAIN. We demonstrate
empirically that DISDAIN improves skill learning both in a tabular grid world

on point cloud segmentation with the power of deep networks, current deep
learning methods based on the clean label assumptions may fail with noisy
labels. Yet, object class labels are often mislabeled in real-world point cloud
datasets. In this work, we take the lead in solving this issue by proposing a
novel Point Noise-Adaptive Learning (PNAL) framework. Compared to existing
noise-robust methods on image tasks, our PNAL is noise-rate blind, to cope with
the spatially variant noise rate problem specific to point clouds.
Specifically, we propose a novel point-wise confidence selection to obtain
reliable labels based on the historical predictions of each point. A novel
cluster-wise label correction is proposed with a voting strategy to generate
the best possible label taking the neighbor point correlations into
consideration. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of PNAL on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets. In
particular, even with $60\%$ symmetric noisy labels, our proposed method
produces much better results than its baseline counterpart without PNAL and is

in our approach contains only three non-hydrodynamic modes corresponding to a

modeling nonthermal energy components, such as unresolved turbulence and cosmic
rays, using idealized fluid dynamics tests and isolated galaxy simulations.
While both methods are aimed to model advection and adiabatic compression or
expansion of different energy components, the energy-based scheme numerically
solves the nonconservative equation for the energy density evolution, while the
entropy-conserving scheme uses a conservative equation for modified entropy.
Using the standard shock tube and Zel'dovich pancake tests, we show that the
energy-based scheme results in a spurious generation of nonthermal energy on
shocks, while the entropy-conserving method evolves the energy adiabatically to
machine precision. We also show that, in simulations of an isolated $L_\star$
galaxy, switching between the schemes results in $\approx 20-30\%$ changes of
the total star formation rate and a significant difference in morphology,
particularly near the galaxy center. We also outline and test a simple method
that can be used in conjunction with the entropy-conserving scheme to model the
injection of nonthermal energies on shocks. Finally, we discuss how the
entropy-conserving scheme can be used to capture the kinetic energy dissipated
by numerical viscosity into the subgrid turbulent energy implicitly, without
explicit source terms that require calibration and can be rather uncertain. Our
results indicate that the entropy-conserving scheme is the preferred choice for
modeling nonthermal energy components, a conclusion that is equally relevant

double current sheets is similar for all sub-Alfv\'enic shears with respect to
the initial transient phase, the onset of the plasmoid instability and the
final relaxation phase. We find that the theoretical scaling of the
reconnection rate with shear holds if the rate is measured when the islands

the reconnection rate during the explosive phase. We have further examined the
modification of the energy spectrum of the accelerated particles in the
presence of a shear. Our results also show that the flow only modifies the high
energy tail of the particle spectrum and has negligible effect on the power-law

associated with the acceleration. Based on the location of the particles, the
acceleration mechanisms are found to vary. We highlight the importance of the
convective electric field in the inflow as well as the outflow region inside
large magnetic islands in the acceleration of particles. The interaction and

distance-dependent dispersion of their signal, and thus can be used as
cosmological probes. In this article we, for the first time, apply a
model-independent approach to measure reionization from synthetic FRB data
assuming these signals are detected beyond redshift 5. This method allows us to
constrain the full shape of the reionization history as well as the CMB optical
depth $\tau$ while avoiding the problems of commonly used model-based
techniques. 100 localized FRBs, originating from redshifts 5-15, could
constrain (at 68% confidence level) the CMB optical depth to within 11%, and
the midpoint of reionization to 4%, surpassing current state-of-the-art CMB
bounds and quasar limits. Owing to the higher numbers of expected FRBs at lower
redshifts, the $\tau$ constraints are asymmetric (+14%, -7%) providing a much
stronger lower limit. Finally, we show that the independent constraints on
reionization from FRBs will improve limits on other cosmological parameters
such as the amplitude of the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations.

astronomical observables and to our understanding of most baryonic processes
within galaxies. The universality of the IMF, suggested by observations in our
own Milky Way, has been thoroughly revisited due to the apparent excess of
low-mass stars in the central regions of massive quiescent galaxies. As part of
the efforts within the Fornax 3D project, we aim to characterize the
two-dimensional IMF variations in a sample of 23 quiescent galaxies within the
Fornax cluster. For each galaxy in the sample, we measured the mean age,
metallicity, [Mg/Fe], and IMF slope maps from spatially resolved integrated
spectra. The IMF maps show a variety of behaviors and internal substructures,
roughly following metallicity variations. However, metallicity alone is not
able to fully explain the complexity exhibited by the IMF maps. In particular,
for relatively metal-poor stellar populations, the slope of the IMF seems to
depend on the (specific) star formation rate at which stars were formed.
Moreover, metallicity maps have systematically higher ellipticities than IMF
slope ones. At the same time, both metallicity and IMF slope maps have at the
same time higher ellipticities than the stellar light distribution in our
sample of galaxies. In addition we find that, regardless of the stellar mass,
every galaxy in our sample shows a positive radial [Mg/Fe] gradient. This
results in a strong [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] relation, similar to what is observed in
nearby, resolved galaxies. Since the formation history and chemical enrichment
of galaxies are causally driven by changes in the IMF, our findings call for a
physically motivated interpretation of stellar population measurements based on
integrated spectra that take into account any possible time evolution of the
stellar populations.

version of the EAGLE simulation to study their inner dark matter (DM) content
and how baryons alter it. As in previous studies, we find that all haloes are
more massive at the centre compared to their DM-only (DMO) counterparts at the
present day as a result of the dissipational collapse of baryons during the
assembly of the galaxy. However, we identify two processes that can reduce the
central halo mass during the evolution of the galaxy. Firstly, gas blowouts
induced by AGN feedback can lead to a substantial decrease of the central DM
mass. Secondly, the formation of a stellar bar and its interaction with the DM
can induce a secular expansion of the halo; the rate at which DM is evacuated
from the central region by this process is related to the average bar strength
and the timescale on which it acts determines how much the halo has
decontracted. Although the inner regions of the haloes we have investigated are
still more massive than their DMO counterparts at $z = 0$, they are
significantly less massive than in the past and less massive than expected from
the classic adiabatic contraction model. Since the MW has both a central
supermassive black hole and a bar, the extent to which its halo has contracted
is uncertain. This may affect estimates of the mass of the MW halo and of the
expected signals in direct and indirect DM detection experiments.

globular clusters (GCs) is accumulated over the past decades from clusters in
the Milky Way and in its satellites. This finding has revived GC research, and
suggested that their formation at high redshift must have been a much-more
complex phenomenon than imagined before. However, most information on MPs is
limited to nearby GCs. The main limitation is that most studies on MPs rely on
resolved stars, facing a major challenge to investigate the MP phenomenon in
distant galaxies. Here we search for integrated colors of old GCs that are
sensitive to the multiple-population phenomenon. To do this, we exploit
integrated magnitudes of simulated GCs with MPs, and multi-band Hubble Space
Telescope photometry of 56 Galactic GCs, where MPs are widely studied, and
characterized as part of the UV Legacy Survey of Galactic GCs. We find that
both integrated $C_{\rm F275W,F336W,F438W}$ and $m_{\rm F275W}-m_{\rm F814W}$
colors strongly correlate with the iron abundance of the host GC. In second
order, the pseudo two-color diagram built with these integrated colors is
sensitive to the MP phenomenon. In particular, once removed the dependence from
cluster metallicity, the color residuals depend on the maximum internal helium
variation within GCs and on the fraction of second-generation stars. This
diagram, which we define here for Galactic GCs, has the potential of detecting
and characterizing MPs from integrated photometry of old GCs, thus providing
the possibility to extend their investigation outside the Local Group.

detailed information about the noise is available, allowing to optimize both
codes and decoders. It has been proposed to estimate error rates from the
syndrome measurements done anyway during quantum error correction. While these
measurements preserve the encoded quantum state, it is currently not clear how
much information about the noise can be extracted in this way. So far, apart
from the limit of vanishing error rates, rigorous results have only been
established for some specific codes. In this work, we rigorously resolve the
question for arbitrary stabilizer codes. The main result is that a stabilizer
code can be used to estimate Pauli channels with correlations across a number
of qubits given by the pure distance. This result does not rely on the limit of
vanishing error rates, and applies even if high weight errors occur frequently.
Moreover, it also allows for measurement errors within the framework of quantum
data-syndrome codes. Our proof combines Boolean Fourier analysis, combinatorics
and elementary algebraic geometry. It is our hope that this work opens up
interesting applications, such as the online adaptation of a decoder to
time-varying noise.

disordered structure. However, its detailed mechanism is still being debated.
Here we analyze sound attenuation starting directly from the microscopic
equations of motion. We derive an exact expression for the zero-temperature
sound damping coefficient. We verify that the sound damping coefficients
calculated from our expression agree very well with results from independent
simulations of sound attenuation. The small wavevector analysis of our
expression shows that sound attenuation is primarily determined by the
non-affine displacements' contribution to the sound wave propagation
coefficient coming from the frequency shell of the sound wave. Our expression
involves only quantities that pertain to solids' static configurations. It can
be used to evaluate the low temperature sound damping coefficients without
directly simulating sound attenuation.

$\sim\!10^9\,M_\odot$) is not understood, but the mass accretion must have
played an important role. We performed two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics
simulations of line-driven disc winds considering the metallicity dependence in
a wide range of the BH mass, and investigated the reduction of the mass
accretion rate due to the wind mass loss. Our results show that denser and
faster disc winds appear at higher metallicities and larger BH masses. The
accretion rate is suppressed to $\sim\! 0.4$--$0.6$ times the mass supply rate
to the disc for the BH mass of $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 10^5\,M_{\odot}$ in
high-metallicity environments of $Z\gtrsim Z_\odot$, while the wind mass loss
is negligible when the metallicity is sub-solar ($\sim 0.1Z_\odot$). By
developing a semi-analytical model, we found that the metallicity dependence of
the line force and the BH mass dependence of the surface area of the wind
launch region are the cause of the metallicity dependence ($\propto\! Z^{2/3}$)
and BH mass dependencies ($\propto\! M_{\rm BH}^{4/3}$ for $M_{\rm BH}\leq
10^6\,M_\odot$ and $\propto\! M_{\rm BH}$ for $M_{\rm BH}\geq 10^6\,M_\odot$)

accretion effectively slows down in the regime $\gtrsim 10^{5}M_\odot$ in
metal-enriched environments $\gtrsim Z_\odot$. This means that the line-driven

high quality light curves and measured the linear size of the BLR in a way that
is complementary to the GRAVITY measurement. The size and kinematics of the BLR
can be better constrained by a joint analysis that combines both GRAVITY and RM

$39.9^{+14.5}_{-11.9}$ Mpc. We are able to test the robustness of the BLR-based
geometric distance with measurements based on the Tully-Fisher relation and
other indirect methods. We find the geometric distance is consistent with other

aligning any statistics of the images between the two domains. Instead, it
utilizes a view transformation network trained only on color images to

images thanks to the inductive bias introduced by the attention mechanism.
Furthermore, to resolve ambiguities in converting the semantic images to

functional label hallucination to generate pseudo-labels in the target domain.

transit technique are required to determine planet bulk properties and
potential habitability. Furthermore, it is generally acknowledged that, for the
foreseeable future, the Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) measurement
technique is the only method potentially capable of detecting and measuring the
masses and orbits of habitable-zone Earths orbiting nearby F, G, and K
spectral-type stars from the ground. In particular, EPRV measurements with a
precision of better than approximately 10 cm/s (with a few cm/s stability over
many years) are required. Unfortunately, for nearly a decade, PRV instruments
and surveys have been unable to routinely reach RV accuracies of less than
roughly 1 m/s. Making EPRV science and technology development a critical
component of both NASA and NSF program plans is crucial for reaching the goal
of detecting potentially habitable Earthlike planets and supporting potential
future exoplanet direct imaging missions such as the Habitable Exoplanet
Observatory (HabEx) or the Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor
(LUVOIR). In recognition of these facts, the 2018 National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) Exoplanet Science Strategy (ESS) report recommended the development of
EPRV measurements as a critical step toward the detection and characterization
of habitable, Earth-analog planets. In response to the NAS-ESS recommendation,
NASA and NSF commissioned the EPRV Working Group to recommend a ground-based
program architecture and implementation plan to achieve the goal intended by
the NAS. This report documents the activities, findings, and recommendations of
the EPRV Working Group.

settings and are typically characterized by sparsity (missing information) and
irregular time intervals. Existing approaches for learning representations in
this domain handle these challenges by either aggregation or imputation of
values, which in-turn suppresses the fine-grained information and adds
undesirable noise/overhead into the machine learning model. To tackle this
problem, we propose a Self-supervised Transformer for Time-Series (STraTS)
model which overcomes these pitfalls by treating time-series as a set of
observation triplets instead of using the standard dense matrix representation.
It employs a novel Continuous Value Embedding technique to encode continuous
time and variable values without the need for discretization. It is composed of
a Transformer component with multi-head attention layers which enable it to
learn contextual triplet embeddings while avoiding the problems of recurrence
and vanishing gradients that occur in recurrent architectures. In addition, to
tackle the problem of limited availability of labeled data (which is typically
observed in many healthcare applications), STraTS utilizes self-supervision by
leveraging unlabeled data to learn better representations by using time-series
forecasting as an auxiliary proxy task. Experiments on real-world multivariate
clinical time-series benchmark datasets demonstrate that STraTS has better
prediction performance than state-of-the-art methods for mortality prediction,
especially when labeled data is limited. Finally, we also present an
interpretable version of STraTS which can identify important measurements in
the time-series data. Our data preprocessing and model implementation codes are

different flat bands. When tuning the out-of-plane electric field across the

strong electronic confinement. From the gate, magnetic field and source-drain

for the Magellanic Clouds), in Fourier space, with lower-resolution data from
all-sky surveys (Planck, IRAS, and COBE) that did not miss the extended
emission. With these new maps, we find that a significant amount of emission
was missing from uncorrected Herschel data of these galaxies; over 20% in some
bands. Our new photometry also resolves the disagreement between fluxes
reported from older HERITAGE Magellanic Cloud Herschel reductions, and fluxes
reported from other telescopes. More emission is restored in shorter wavelength
bands, especially in the galaxies' peripheries, making these regions 20-40%
bluer than before. We also find that the Herschel-PACS instrument response
conflicts with the all-sky data, over the 20-90' angular scales to which they
are both sensitive, by up to 31%. By binning our new data based on hydrogen

investigation, we performed force field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to
generate detailed structural representations for ten natural
CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-TiO2-FeO-Fe2O3-Na2O-K2O glasses with compositions ranging
from rhyolitic to basaltic. Based on the resulting atomic structural
representations at 300 K, we have calculated the partial radial distribution
functions, nearest interatomic distances and coordination number, which are
consistent with the literature data on silicate-based glasses. Based on these
structural attributes and classical bond valence models, we have introduced a
novel structural descriptor, i.e., average metal-oxygen (M-O) bond strength
parameter, which has captured the log dissolution rates of the ten glasses at
both acidic and basic conditions (based on literature data) with R2 values of
~0.80-0.92 based on linear regression. This structural descriptor is seen to
outperform several other structural descriptors also derived from MD simulation
results, including the average metal oxide dissociation energy, the average
self-diffusion coefficient of all the atoms at their melting points, and the
energy barrier of self-diffusion. Furthermore, we showed that the MD-derived
descriptors generally exhibit better predictive performance than the degree of
depolymerization parameter commonly used to describe glass and mineral
reactivity. The results suggest that the structural descriptors derived from MD
simulations, especially the average M-O bond strength parameter, are promising
structural descriptors for connecting composition with dissolution rates of
highly complex natural glasses.

has been long always assumed that the reference to be tracked and the
disturbance to be rejected must be generated by an exosystem such as a finite
dimensional exosystem with pure imaginary eigenvalues. The objective of this
paper is to solve such a tracking problem for the unstable Burgers' equation
without this assumption. Our treatment of this problem is straightforward.
Using the method of variable transform, the tracking problem is split into two
separate problems: a simple Neumann boundary stabilization problem and a
dynamical Neumann boundary regulator problem. Unlike the existing literature
where the regulator problem is always kept independent, the stabilization
problem here is simplified to an independent linear diffusion equation by
moving the instability term and the nonlinear term to the dynamical regulator
problem, whereas the dynamical regulator problem does depend on the
stabilization problem.
  Thus we can first easily handle the stabilization problem and then solve the
dynamical regulator problem by using the fundamental theory of partial
differential equations. The boundary feedforward controller is explicitly
constructed by using the reference, the disturbance and the solution of the
stabilization problem while the boundary feedback controller is easily designed
for the linear diffusion equation without using a complex method such as the
backstepping method. It is proved that, under the designed feedback and
feedforward controllers, the tracking error converges to zero exponentially.
This theoretical result is confirmed by a numerical example.

characterisation of chain mixing $\bar{d}$-approachable shift spaces. As an
application we provide a new criterion for entropy density of ergodic measures.
Entropy-density of a shift space means that every invariant measure $\mu$ of
such a shift space is the weak$^*$ limit of a sequence $\mu_n$ of ergodic
measures with the corresponding sequence of entropies $h(\mu_n)$ converging to
$h(\mu)$. We prove ergodic measures are entropy-dense for every shift space

simultaneously searching for model parameters and a certificate of stability,
and scalability to networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes. We propose a
model set that admits convex constraints for stability and monotonicity, and
has a separable structure that allows distributed identification via the
alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM). The performance and

particles (SEPs) with a sampling of chemical elements. Thus began study of the
direct products of dynamic physics in the solar corona. As we have progressed
from 4-min sounding-rocket samples to continuous satellite coverage of SEP
events, we have extended the observations to the unusual distribution of
element abundances throughout the periodic table. Small ""impulsive"" SEP events
from islands of magnetic reconnection on open magnetic-field lines in solar
jets generate huge enhancements in abundances of 3He and of the heaviest
elements. Solar flares involve the same physics but there the SEPs are trapped
on closed loops, expending their energy as heat and light. The larger,
energetic ""gradual"" SEP events are accelerated at shock waves driven by fast,
wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, these shocks can also reaccelerate
ions from pools of residual suprathermal impulsive ions, and CMEs from jets can
also drive fast shocks, complicating the picture. The underlying element
abundances in SEP events represent the solar corona, which differs from
corresponding abundances in the photosphere as a function of the first
ionization potential (FIP) of the elements, distinguishing low-FIP (<10 eV)
ions from high-FIP neutral atoms as they expand through the chromosphere.
Dependence of SEP acceleration upon A/Q allows best-fit estimation of ion
Q-values and hence of the source plasma temperature of ~1 - 3 MK, derived from
abundances, which correlates with recent measures of temperatures using extreme
ultraviolet emission from jets. New questions arise, however, about the
theoretical basis of correlations of energy-spectral indices with power-laws of
abundances, about the coexistence of mechanisms for enhancements of 3He and of
heavy elements, and about the overall paucity of C in FIP comparisons.

supermassive black hole (SMBH). It is suggested that the gravitational-wave
(GW) emitted by a BBH has a high probability to be lensed by the SMBH if the
BBH's orbit around the SMBH (i.e., the outer orbit) has a period of less than a
year and is less than the duration of observation of the BBH by a space-borne
GW observatory. For such a BBH + SMBH triple system, the de Sitter precession
of the BBH's orbital plane is also significant. In this work, we thus study GW
waveforms emitted by the BBH and then modulated by the SMBH due to effects
including Doppler shift, de Sitter precession, and gravitational lensing. We
show specifically that for an outer orbital period of 0.1 yr and an SMBH mass
of $10^7 M_\odot$, there is a 3\%-10\% chance for the standard, strong lensing
signatures to be detectable by space-borne GW detectors such as LISA and/or
TianGO. For more massive lenses ($\gtrsim 10^8 M_\odot$) and more compact outer
orbits with periods <0.1 yr, retro-lensing of the SMBH might also have a
1%-level chance of detection. Furthermore, by combining the lensing effects and
the dynamics of the outer orbit, we find the mass of the central SMBH can be
accurately determined with a fraction error of $\sim 10^{-4}$. This is much
better than the case of static lensing because the degeneracy between the lens'
mass and the source's angular position is lifted by the outer orbital motion.
Including lensing effects also allows the de Sitter precession to be detectable
at a precession period 3 times longer than the case without lensing. Lastly, we
demonstrate that one can check the consistency between the SMBH's mass
determined from the orbital dynamics and the one inferred from gravitational
lensing, which serves as a test on theories behind both phenomena. The
statistical error on the deviation can be constrained to a 1% level.

circumventing many of the issues of empirical longitudinal studies; simulations
are comparatively easier to implement, are highly controlled, and pose no
ethical risk to human participants. How simulation can best contribute to
scientific insight about RS alongside qualitative and quantitative empirical
approaches is an open question. Philosophers and researchers have long debated
the epistemological nature of simulation compared to wholly theoretical or
empirical methods. Simulation is often implicitly or explicitly conceptualized
as occupying a middle ground between empirical and theoretical approaches,
allowing researchers to realize the benefits of both. However, what is often
ignored in such arguments is that without firm grounding in any single
methodological tradition, simulation studies have no agreed upon scientific
norms or standards, resulting in a patchwork of theoretical motivations,
approaches, and implementations that are difficult to reconcile. In this
position paper, we argue that simulation studies of RS are conceptually similar
to empirical experimental approaches and therefore can be evaluated using the
standards of empirical research methods. Using this empirical lens, we argue
that the combination of high heterogeneity in approaches and low transparency
in methods in simulation studies of RS has limited their interpretability,
generalizability, and replicability. We contend that by adopting standards and
practices common in empirical disciplines, simulation researchers can mitigate
many of these weaknesses.

the planet. We combine our observations with Spitzer dayside photometry (3.6

models that span a range of metallicities, carbon-to-oxygen ratios, and
recirculation factors. Given the strength of the planetary emission and the
precision of our measurements, we found a wide range of forward models to be
consistent with our data. The best-match equilibrium model suggests that
WASP-79b's dayside has a solar metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio,
alongside a recirculation factor of 0.75. Models including significant H-

vigorous vertical mixing and low sedimentation efficiencies-with little

the broad range of equilibrium chemistry, disequilibrium chemistry, and cloudy
atmospheric models consistent with our observations of WASP-79b's dayside
emission, further observations will be necessary to constrain WASP-79b's

systems which store energy through reversible ion adsorption at the

carbons used as electrodes, extracting structure-property relationships in
these systems remains a challenge. In this work, we conduct molecular
simulations of two model supercapacitors based on nanoporous electrodes with
the same average pore size, a property often used when comparing porous
materials, but different morphologies. We show that the carbon with the more
ordered structure, and a well defined pore size, has a much higher capacitance
than the carbon with the more disordered structure, and a broader pore size
distribution. We analyze the structure of the confined electrolyte and show
that the ions adsorbed in the ordered carbon are present in larger quantities
and are also more confined than for the disordered carbon. Both aspects favor a
better charge separation and thus a larger capacitance. In addition, the
disordered electrodes contain a significant amount of carbon atoms which are
never in contact with the electrolyte, carry a close to zero charge and are
thus not involved in the charge storage. The total quantities of adsorbed ions
and degrees of confinement do not change much with the applied potential and as
such, this work opens the door to computationally tractable screening
strategies.

third closest repeating fast radio burst recently localized in a nearby

radio emission, also marginally visible in X-rays with Chandra. Imaging at 22
GHz allowed us to resolve the source on a scale of $\gtrsim$ 1 arcsec and
locate it at the position of the FRB, within an error of 0.2 arcsec. EVN and
e-MERLIN observations sampled small angular scales, from 2 to 100 mas,
providing tight upper limits on the presence of a compact source and evidence
for diffuse radio emission. We argue that this emission is associated with
enhanced star formation activity in the proximity of the FRB, corresponding to
a star formation rate of $\approx 10\ {\rm M}_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$. The surface
star formation rate at the location of FRB 20201124A is two orders of magnitude
larger than typically observed in other precisely localized FRBs. Such a high
SFR is indicative of this FRB source being a new-born magnetar produced from a

low-energy physics of various quantum-critical metallic systems at the verge of
an instability towards density or spin order, pairing of fermions at the
half-filled Landau level, color superconductivity, and pairing in SYK-type

<1$, a peculiar one for $1<\gamma <2$, when the phase of the gap function winds
up along real frequency axis due to emerging dynamical vortices in the upper
half-plane of frequency, and that there is a quantum phase transition at
$\gamma =2$, when the number of dynamical vortices becomes infinite. In this
paper we consider larger $2< \gamma <3$ and address the issue what happens on
the other side of this quantum transition. We argue that the system moves away
from criticality in that the number of dynamical vortices becomes finite and
decreases with increasing $\gamma$. The ground state is again a superconductor,
however a highly unconventional one with a non-integrable singularity in the
density of states at the lower edge of the continuum. This implies that the
spectrum of excited states now contains a level with a macroscopic degeneracy,
proportional to the total number of states in the system. We argue that the
phase diagram in variables $(T,\gamma)$ contains two distinct superconducting
phases for $\gamma <2$ and $\gamma >2$, and an intermediate pseudogap state of
preformed pairs.

and in setting policy. For a market, this function can often be estimated from
observed behavior -- preferences are revealed. However, economists would like
to measure consumers' willingness to pay for some goods where this can only be
measured through stated valuation. Confirmed convergence of valuations based on
stated preferences as compared to valuations based on revealed preferences is
rare, and it is important to establish circumstances under which one can expect
such convergence. By building a simple probabilistic model for the consumers'
likelihood of travel, we provide an approach that should make comparing stated
and revealed preferences easier in cases where the preference is tied to travel
or some other behavior whose cost can be measured. We implemented this approach
in a pilot study and found an estimate of willingness to pay for visiting an
environmentally enhanced recreational site based on actual travel in good
agreement with an estimate based on a survey using stated preferences. To use
the probabilistic model we used population statistics to adjust for the
relevant duration and thus compare stated and revealed responses.

vision, but their generalization ability to image distortions is surprisingly
fragile. In contrast, the mammalian visual system is robust to a wide range of
perturbations. Recent work suggests that this generalization ability can be
explained by useful inductive biases encoded in the representations of visual
stimuli throughout the visual cortex. Here, we successfully leveraged these
inductive biases with a multi-task learning approach: we jointly trained a deep
network to perform image classification and to predict neural activity in
macaque primary visual cortex (V1). We measured the out-of-distribution
generalization abilities of our network by testing its robustness to image
distortions. We found that co-training on monkey V1 data leads to increased
robustness despite the absence of those distortions during training.
Additionally, we showed that our network's robustness is very close to that of
an Oracle network where parts of the architecture are directly trained on noisy
images. Our results also demonstrated that the network's representations become
more brain-like as their robustness improves. Using a novel constrained
reconstruction analysis, we investigated what makes our brain-regularized
network more robust. We found that our co-trained network is more sensitive to
content than noise when compared to a Baseline network that we trained for
image classification alone. Using DeepGaze-predicted saliency maps for ImageNet
images, we found that our monkey co-trained network tends to be more sensitive
to salient regions in a scene, reminiscent of existing theories on the role of
V1 in the detection of object borders and bottom-up saliency. Overall, our work
expands the promising research avenue of transferring inductive biases from the
brain, and provides a novel analysis of the effects of our transfer.

participants listening to a robot storyteller (46 participants, 6.9 hours of

questionnaire that assessed their level of elicited empathy during the
interaction with the robot. We conducted experiments with 8 classical machine

temporal convolutional networks) to detect empathy by leveraging patterns in
participants' visual behaviors while they were listening to the robot

hole and neutron star collisions from the entire stellar history of the
universe. To achieve the designed detector sensitivities, frequency noise from
the laser source must be reduced below the level achieved in current Advanced
LIGO detectors. This paper reviews the laser frequency noise suppression scheme
in Advanced LIGO, and quantifies the noise coupling to the gravitational-wave
readout. The laser frequency noise incident on the current Advanced LIGO
detectors is $8 \times 10^{-5}~\mathrm{Hz/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at $1~\mathrm{kHz}$.
Future detectors will require even lower incident frequency noise levels to
ensure this technical noise source does not limit sensitivity. The frequency
noise requirement for a gravitational wave detector with arm lengths of
$40~\mathrm{km}$ is estimated to be $7 \times 10^{-7}~\mathrm{Hz/\sqrt{Hz}}$.
To reach this goal a new frequency noise suppression scheme is proposed,
utilizing two input mode cleaner cavities, and the limits of this scheme are
explored. Using this scheme the frequency noise requirement is met, even in
pessimistic noise coupling scenarios.

distribution of COVID-19 health risks? To address this question, I study the
association between the incidence of COVID-19 and the degree of spousal sorting
into occupations that differ by contact intensity at the workplace. The
mechanism, that I explore, implies that the higher degree of positive spousal
sorting mitigates intra-household contagion and this translates into a smaller
number of individuals exposed to COVID-19 risk. Using the U.S. data at the
state level, I argue that spousal sorting is an important factor for
understanding the disparities in the prevalence of COVID-19 during the early
stages of the pandemic. First, I document that it creates about two-thirds of
the U.S. dual-earner couples that are exposed to higher COVID-19 health risk
due to within-household transmission. Moreover, I uncover substantial
heterogeneity in the degree of spousal sorting by state. Next, for the first
week of April 2020, I estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the
measure of spousal sorting is associated with a 30% reduction in the total
number of cases per 100000 inhabitants and a 39.3% decline in the total number
of deaths per 100000 inhabitants. Furthermore, I find substantial temporal
heterogeneity as the coefficients decline in magnitude over time. My results
speak to the importance of policies that allow mitigating intra-household
contagion.

recent years, yet progress in the field continues to suffer from a lack of

address this shortcoming by introducing an open-source, reproducible
benchmarking platform for symbolic regression. We assess 14 symbolic regression
methods and 7 machine learning methods on a set of 252 diverse regression
problems. Our assessment includes both real-world datasets with no known model
form as well as ground-truth benchmark problems, including physics equations
and systems of ordinary differential equations. For the real-world datasets, we
benchmark the ability of each method to learn models with low error and low
complexity relative to state-of-the-art machine learning methods. For the
synthetic problems, we assess each method's ability to find exact solutions in
the presence of varying levels of noise. Under these controlled experiments, we
conclude that the best performing methods for real-world regression combine
genetic algorithms with parameter estimation and/or semantic search drivers.
When tasked with recovering exact equations in the presence of noise, we find
that deep learning and genetic algorithm-based approaches perform similarly. We
provide a detailed guide to reproducing this experiment and contributing new
methods, and encourage other researchers to collaborate with us on a common and
living symbolic regression benchmark.

Our simulations are found to be in agreement with experimental results of
surfactant self assembly in scCO2 that found viscosity increments of up to 90
percent with 10 wt percent of surfactants. The role played by a small number of
water molecules in RM formation is studied as well in both solvents,
corroborating experiments reporting the enhancement of RM formation with the

The results show that RMs are more easily formed in oil than in scCO2 and that
the effectiveness of the surfactant in reducing the interfacial tension lies in
its preference to adsorb at interfaces rather than self association.

information processing, including high-rate high-fidelity quantum
communications over long distances. The most popular and mature sources of such
photonic entanglement, e.g., those that leverage spontaneous parametric

entangled (so-called, continuous-variable) quantum state that contains
contributions from high-order photon terms that lie outside the span of the

pump power to mitigate the effects of those high-order terms. However that
reduces the pair generation rate, and the source becomes inherently
probabilistic. We investigate a cascaded source that performs a linear-optical
entanglement swap between two SPDC sources, to generate a heralded photonic
entangled state that has a higher fidelity (to the ideal Bell state) compared
to a free-running SPDC source. Further, with the Bell swap providing a
heralding trigger, we show how to build a multiplexed source, which despite
reasonable switching losses and detector loss and noise, yields a Fidelity
versus Success Probability trade-off of a high-efficiency source of
high-fidelity dual-rail photonic entanglement. We find however that there is a
threshold of $1.5$ dB of loss per switch, beyond which multiplexing hurts the

biomedical image analysis, most of these methods rely on high-quality and
accurate imaging data. However, collecting such data requires intensive and
careful manual effort. One of the major challenges in imaging the Shoot Apical
Meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis thaliana, is that the deeper slices in the
z-stack suffer from different perpetual quality-related problems like poor
contrast and blurring. These quality-related issues often lead to the disposal
of the painstakingly collected data with little to no control on quality while
collecting the data. Therefore, it becomes necessary to employ and design
techniques that can enhance the images to make them more suitable for further
analysis. In this paper, we propose a data-driven Deep Quantized Latent
Representation (DQLR) methodology for high-quality image reconstruction in the
Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our proposed framework
utilizes multiple consecutive slices in the z-stack to learn a low dimensional
latent space, quantize it and subsequently perform reconstruction using the
quantized representation to obtain sharper images. Experiments on a publicly
available dataset validate our methodology showing promising results.

multi-agent decision-making problems with a discrete feasible set. A prominent
example is the problem of multi-agent mobile sensor placement over a discrete

NP-hard. This paper considers a class of submodular optimization problems that
consist of maximization of a monotone and submodular set function subject to a
uniform matroid constraint over a group of networked agents that communicate
over a connected undirected graph. We work in the value oracle model where the
only access of the agents to the utility function is through a black box that
returns the utility function value. We propose a distributed suboptimal
polynomial-time algorithm that enables each agent to obtain its respective
strategy via local interactions with its neighboring agents. Our solution is a
fully distributed gradient-based algorithm using the submodular set functions'
multilinear extension followed by a distributed stochastic Pipage rounding
procedure. This algorithm results in a strategy set that when the team utility
function is evaluated at worst case, the utility function value is in
1/c(1-e^(-c)-O(1/T)) of the optimal solution with c to be the curvature of the
submodular function. An example demonstrates our results.

summarize the topological characteristics associated with scalar fields. They
present a great potential for the analysis and visualization of time-varying
data. First, they give compressed and topology-preserving representations of
data instances. Second, their comparisons provide a basis for studying the
relations among data instances, such as their distributions, clusters,
outliers, and periodicities. A number of comparative measures have been
developed for merge trees. However, these measures are often computationally
expensive since they implicitly consider all possible correspondences between
critical points of the merge trees. In this paper, we perform geometry-aware
comparisons of merge trees using labeled interleaving distances. The main idea
is to decouple the computation of a comparative measure into two steps: a
labeling step that generates a correspondence between the critical points of
two merge trees, and a comparison step that computes distances between a pair
of labeled merge trees by encoding them as matrices. We show that our approach
is general, computationally efficient, and practically useful. Our general
framework makes it possible to integrate geometric information of the data
domain in the labeling process. At the same time, it reduces the computational
complexity since not all possible correspondences have to be considered. We
demonstrate via experiments that such geometry-aware merge tree comparisons
help to detect transitions, clusters, and periodicities of time-varying
datasets, as well as to diagnose and highlight the topological changes between
adjacent data instances.

track. Unlike traditional object detection challenges, which focus mainly on
the absolute performance, streaming perception task requires achieving a
balance of accuracy and latency, which is crucial for real-time autonomous
driving. We adopt YOLOv5 as our basic framework, data augmentation,
Bag-of-Freebies, and Transformer are adopted to improve streaming object
detection performance with negligible extra inference cost. On the Argoverse-HD

surpasses the fixed baseline of 13.6 (host team), demonstrating the
potentiality of application.

and propose a new architecture, namely Hallucinated Hollow-3D R-CNN
($\text{H}^2$3D R-CNN), to address the problem of 3D object detection. In our
approach, we first extract the multi-view features by sequentially projecting
the point clouds into the perspective view and the bird-eye view. Then, we
hallucinate the 3D representation by a novel bilaterally guided multi-view
fusion block. Finally, the 3D objects are detected via a box refinement module
with a novel Hierarchical Voxel RoI Pooling operation. The proposed
$\text{H}^2$3D R-CNN provides a new angle to take full advantage of
complementary information in the perspective view and the bird-eye view with an
efficient framework. We evaluate our approach on the public KITTI Dataset and

problem which attempts to map multiple customized virtual network requests
(also called services) to a common shared network infrastructure and allocate
network resources to meet diverse service requirements. The problem has been
formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation in the
literature. We first propose a novel linear programming (LP) relaxation of the
MILP formulation. We show that compared with a natural LP relaxation of the
MILP formulation, the novel LP relaxation is much more compact in terms of
smaller numbers of variables and constraints, and much stronger in terms of
providing a better LP bound, which makes it particularly suitable to be
embedded in an LP relaxation based algorithm. Then we design an efficient
two-stage LP dynamic rounding-and-refinement algorithm based on this novel LP
relaxation. In the first stage, the proposed algorithm uses an LP dynamic
rounding procedure to place the virtual network functions of all services into
cloud nodes while taking traffic routing of all services into consideration; in
the second stage, the proposed algorithm uses an iterative LP refinement
procedure to obtain a solution for traffic routing of all services with their
end-to-end delay constraints being satisfied. Compared with the existing
algorithms which either have an exponential complexity or return a low-quality
solution, our proposed algorithm achieves a better trade-off between the
solution quality and the computational complexity. In particular, the
worst-case complexity of our proposed algorithm is polynomial, which makes it
suitable for solving large-scale problems. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

optimal VSL control strategy under fog conditions with fully consideration of
factors that affect traffic safety risks. The crash risk under fog conditions
was estimated using a crash risk prediction model based on Bayesian logistic
regression. The traffic flow with VSL control was simulated by a modified cell
transmission model (MCTM). The optimal factors of VSL control were obtained by
solving an optimization problem that coordinated safety and mobility with the
help of the genetic algorithm. An example of I-405 in California, USA was
designed to simulate and evaluate the effects of the proposed VSL control
strategy. The optimal VSL control factors under fog conditions were compared

Results showed that the optimal VSL control strategy under fog conditions
changed the speed limit more cautiously. The VSL control under fog conditions
in this study effectively reduced crash risks without significantly increasing
travel time, which is up to 37.15% reduction of risks and only 0.48% increase

semiconductor is an important problem. Early detection of defective product
production in the manufacturing process can save huge production cost. The data
generated from the semiconductor manufacturing process have characteristics of
highly non-normal distributions, complicated missing patterns and high missing
rate, which complicate the prediction of the yield. We propose Dirichlet
process - naive Bayes model (DPNB), a classification method based on the
mixtures of Dirichlet process and naive Bayes model. Since the DPNB is based on
the mixtures of Dirichlet process and learns the joint distribution of all
variables involved, it can handle highly non-normal data and can make
predictions for the test dataset with any missing patterns. The DPNB also
performs well for high missing rates since it uses all information of observed
components. Experiments on various real datasets including semiconductor
manufacturing data show that the DPNB has better performance than MICE and
MissForest in terms of predicting missing values as percentage of missing
values increases.

The solution spaces that result from different choices of dynamical systems and

network structure to compress the feature into a low dimensional space, and an
inhomogeneous neighborhood relationship preserving (INRP) loss that aims to
maintain high search accuracy. Specifically, we use multiple compression
projections to cast the feature into many low dimensional spaces, and then use
transformer to globally optimize these projections such that the features are
well compressed following the guidance from our loss function. The loss
function is designed to assign high weights on point pairs that are close in
original feature space, and keep their distances in projected space. Keeping
these distances helps maintain the eventual top-k retrieval accuracy, and down
weighting others creates room for feature compression. In experiments, we run
our compression method on public datasets, and use the compressed features in
graph based, product quantization and scalar quantization based ANNS solutions.
Experimental results show that our compression method can significantly improve
the efficiency of these methods while preserves or even improves search
accuracy, suggesting its broad potential impact on real world applications.

interfacial properties of compounds and multiphase materials. However, the
simulation of reactions and mechanical properties up to failure remains
challenging and expensive. Here we introduce the Reactive Interface Force Field
(IFF-R) to analyze bond breaking and failure of complex materials using
molecular dynamics simulations. IFF-R uses a Morse potential instead of a
harmonic potential as typically employed in molecular dynamics force fields to
describe the bond energy, which can render any desired bond reactive by
specification of the curve shape of the potential energy and the bond
dissociation energy. This facile extension of IFF and other force fields that
utilize a harmonic bond energy term allows the description of bond breaking
without loss in functionality, accuracy, and speed. The method enables
quantitative, on-the-fly computations of bond breaking and stress-strain curves
up to failure in any material. We illustrate accurate predictions of mechanical
behavior for a variety of material systems, including metals (iron), ceramics
(carbon nanotubes), polymers (polyacrylonitrile and cellulose I\b{eta}), and
include sample parameters for common bonds based on using experimental and
high-level (MP2) quantum mechanical reference data. Computed structures,
surface energies, elastic moduli, and tensile strengths are in excellent
agreement with available experimental data. Non-reactive properties are shown
to be essentially identical to IFF values. Computations are approximately 50
times faster than using ReaxFF and require only a single set of parameters.
Compatibility of IFF and IFF-R with biomolecular force fields allows the
quantitative analysis of the mechanics of proteins, DNA, and other biological
molecules.

between the largest and smallest coordinates of the principal eigenvector of

$\gamma(G)$ ranges from $1$ to $n^{cn}$. Moreover, $\gamma(G)=1$ if and only if
$G$ is regular. This indicates that $\gamma(G)$ can be viewed as an
irregularity measure of $G$, as first suggested by Tait and Tobin (El. J. Lin.
Alg. 2018). We are interested in how stable this measure is. In particular, we
ask how $\gamma$ changes when there is a small modification to a regular graph
$G$. We show that this ratio is polynomially bounded if we remove an edge
belonging to a cycle of bounded length in $G$, while the ratio can jump from
$1$ to exponential if we join a pair of vertices at distance $2$. We study the
connection between the spectral gap of a regular graph and the stability of its
principal ratio. A naive bound shows that given a constant multiplicative
spectral gap and bounded degree, the ratio remains polynomially bounded if we
add or delete an edge. Using results from matrix perturbation theory, we show
that given an additive spectral gap greater than $(2+\epsilon)\sqrt{n}$, the
ratio stays bounded after adding or deleting an edge.

finding a signal-rich, low-dimensional representation. For linear subspaces,
this is generally performed by decomposing a design matrix (via eigenvalue or
singular value decomposition) into orthogonal components, and then retaining
those components with sufficient variations. This is equivalent to estimating
the rank of the matrix and deciding which components to retain is generally
carried out using heuristic or ad-hoc approaches such as plotting the
decreasing sequence of the eigenvalues and looking for the ""elbow"" in the plot.
While these approaches have been shown to be effective, a poorly calibrated or
misjudged elbow location can result in an overabundance of noise or an
under-abundance of signal in the low-dimensional representation, making
subsequent modeling difficult. In this article, we propose a

planetary bodies, are often too hazardous for humans, and as such, robots are
possible surrogates. These robots are met with significant locomotion
challenges that require traversing a wide range of surface roughnesses and
topologies. Previous locomotion strategies, involving wheels or ambulatory
motion, such as snake platforms, have success on specific surfaces but fail in
others which could be detrimental in exploration and navigation missions. In
this paper, we present a novel approach that combines snake-like robots with an
Archimedean screw locomotion mechanism to provide multiple, effective mobility
strategies in a large range of environments, including those that are difficult
to traverse for wheeled and ambulatory robots. This work develops a robotic
system called ARCSnake to demonstrate this locomotion principle and tested it
in a variety of different terrains and environments in order to prove its
controllable, multi-domain, navigation capabilities. These tests show a wide
breadth of scenarios that ARCSnake can handle, hence demonstrating its ability
to traverse through extreme terrains.

  Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Semantic segmentation requires per-pixel prediction for a given image.
Typically, the output resolution of a segmentation network is severely reduced
due to the downsampling operations in the CNN backbone. Most previous methods
employ upsampling decoders to recover the spatial resolution. Various decoders
were designed in the literature. Here, we propose a novel decoder, termed
dynamic neural representational decoder (NRD), which is simple yet
significantly more efficient. As each location on the encoder's output
corresponds to a local patch of the semantic labels, in this work, we represent
these local patches of labels with compact neural networks. This neural
representation enables our decoder to leverage the smoothness prior in the
semantic label space, and thus makes our decoder more efficient. Furthermore,
these neural representations are dynamically generated and conditioned on the
outputs of the encoder networks. The desired semantic labels can be efficiently
decoded from the neural representations, resulting in high-resolution semantic
segmentation predictions. We empirically show that our proposed decoder can
outperform the decoder in DeeplabV3+ with only 30% computational complexity,
and achieve competitive performance with the methods using dilated encoders
with only 15% computation. Experiments on the Cityscapes, ADE20K, and PASCAL
Context datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
method.

since taking a picture is a process of projection of a 3D scene onto a 2D
imaging sensor, the depth information is embedded in the image. Extracting the
depth information from the image is a challenging task. A guiding principle is
that the level of blurriness due to defocus is related to the distance between
the object and the focal plane. Based on this principle and the widely used
assumption that Gaussian blur is a good model for defocus blur, we formulate
the problem of estimating the spatially varying defocus blurriness as a
Gaussian blur classification problem. We solved the problem by training a deep
neural network to classify image patches into one of the 20 levels of
blurriness. We have created a dataset of more than 500000 image patches of size
$32\times32$ which are used to train and test several well-known network
models. We find that MobileNetV2 is suitable for this application due to its
low memory requirement and high accuracy. The trained model is used to
determine the patch blurriness which is then refined by applying an iterative
weighted guided filter. The result is a defocus map that carries the
information of the degree of blurriness for each pixel. We compare the proposed
method with state-of-the-art techniques and we demonstrate its successful

us to remove some filters/channels with acceptable performance drops. However,
the training objective of CNNs usually tends to minimize an accuracy-related

redundancy distribute randomly on all the filters, such that removing any of
them may trigger information loss and accuracy drop, necessitating a following
finetuning step for recovery. In this paper, we propose to manipulate the
redundancy during training to facilitate network pruning. To this end, we
propose a novel Centripetal SGD (C-SGD) to make some filters identical,
resulting in ideal redundancy patterns, as such filters become purely redundant
due to their duplicates; hence removing them does not harm the network. As
shown on CIFAR and ImageNet, C-SGD delivers better performance because the
redundancy is better organized, compared to the existing methods. The
efficiency also characterizes C-SGD because it is as fast as regular SGD,
requires no finetuning, and can be conducted simultaneously on all the layers
even in very deep CNNs. Besides, C-SGD can improve the accuracy of CNNs by
first training a model with the same architecture but wider layers then
squeezing it into the original width.

neural network-based source separation, used for both utterance-level
separation with utterance-level PIT (uPIT) and separation of long recordings
with the recently proposed Graph-PIT. When implemented naively, both suffer
from an exponential complexity in the number of utterances to separate,
rendering them unusable for large numbers of speakers or long realistic
recordings. We present a decomposition of the PIT criterion into the
computation of a matrix and a strictly monotonously increasing function so that
the permutation or assignment problem can be solved efficiently with several
search algorithms. The Hungarian algorithm can be used for uPIT and we
introduce various algorithms for the Graph-PIT assignment problem to reduce the
complexity to be polynomial in the number of utterances.

which calls for continuous speech separation (CSS) systems. The uPIT criterion
was proposed for utterance-level separation with neural networks and introduces
the constraint that the total number of speakers must not exceed the number of
output channels. When processing meeting-like data in a segment-wise manner,
i.e., by separating overlapping segments independently and stitching adjacent
segments to continuous output streams, this constraint has to be fulfilled for
any segment. In this contribution, we show that this constraint can be
significantly relaxed. We propose a novel graph-based PIT criterion, which
casts the assignment of utterances to output channels in a graph coloring
problem. It only requires that the number of concurrently active speakers must
not exceed the number of output channels. As a consequence, the system can
process an arbitrary number of speakers and arbitrarily long segments and thus
can handle more diverse scenarios. Further, the stitching algorithm for
obtaining a consistent output order in neighboring segments is of less
importance and can even be eliminated completely, not the least reducing the
computational effort. Experiments on meeting-style WSJ data show improvements
in recognition performance over using the uPIT criterion.

high-order correlations among multiple domains and categories are fully

Tensor-Low-Rank (TLR) constraint on a tensor obtained by stacking up a group of
prototypical similarity matrices, aiming at capturing consistent data structure
across different domains. Furthermore, to avoid negative transfer brought by
noisy source data, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware weighting strategy to
adaptively assign weights to different source domains and samples based on the
result of uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on public

complement this loss with a structure preserving constraint based on
contrastive learning, which prevents blurring and content shifts due to
overfitting. We apply this method to the registration of histological sections
to MRI slices, a key step in 3D histology reconstruction. Results on two
different public datasets show improvements over registration based on mutual

  a channel","10 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Colloidal inclusions suspended in a bath of smaller particles experience an
effective bath-mediated attraction at small intersurface separations, which is
known as the depletion interaction. In an active bath of nonchiral
self-propelled particles, the effective force changes from attraction to
repulsion; an effect that is suppressed, when the active bath particles are
chiral. Using Brownian Dynamics simulations, we study the effects of channel
confinement and bath chirality on the effective forces and torques that are
mediated between two inclusions that may be fixed within the channel or may be
allowed to rotate freely as a rigid dimer around its center of mass. We show
that the confinement has a strong effect on the effective interactions,
depending on the orientation of the dimer relative to the channel walls. The
active particle chirality leads to a force imbalance and, hence, a net torque
on the inclusion dimer, which we investigate as a function of the bath
chirality strength and the channel height.

state-of-the-art performance in optimizing a black-box objective function.
However, they usually require several approximations or simplifying assumptions
(without clearly understanding their effects on the BO performance) and/or
their generalization to batch BO is computationally unwieldy, especially with
an increasing batch size. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents a
novel trusted-maximizers entropy search (TES) acquisition function: It measures
how much an input query contributes to the information gain on the maximizer
over a finite set of trusted maximizers, i.e., inputs optimizing functions that
are sampled from the Gaussian process posterior belief of the objective
function. Evaluating TES requires either only a stochastic approximation with
sampling or a deterministic approximation with expectation propagation, both of
which are investigated and empirically evaluated using synthetic benchmark
objective functions and real-world optimization problems, e.g., hyperparameter
tuning of a convolutional neural network and synthesizing 'physically
realizable' faces to fool a black-box face recognition system. Though TES can
naturally be generalized to a batch variant with either approximation, the
latter is amenable to be scaled to a much larger batch size in our experiments.

now subsiding. Increasingly the focus amongst the policy makers and general
public is on the potential third wave. Due to uncertainties regarding emergence
of new variants and reinfections, instead of projecting our best guess
scenario, in this report we conduct an extensive scenario analysis for Mumbai
and track peak fatalities in the coming months in each of these scenarios. Our
key conclusions are - As per our model, about 80% of Mumbai population has been
exposed to Covid-19 by June 1, 2021. Under the assumption that all who are
exposed have immunity against further infection, it is unlikely that Mumbai
would see a large third wave. It is the reinfections that may lead to a large
wave. Reinfections could occur because of declining antibodies amongst the
infected as well as by variants that can break through the immunity provided by
prior infections. Even under a reasonably pessimistic scenario we observe the
resulting peak to be no larger than that under the second wave. We further
observe that under the scenario where the reinfections are mild so that they
affect the fatality figures negligibly, where the new variants (beyond the
existing delta variant) have a mild impact, as the city opens up, we observe a
small wave in the coming months. However, if by then the vaccine coverage is
extensive, this wave will be barely noticeable. We also plot $R_t$, the
infection growth rate at time $t$, and highlight some interesting observations.

achieve the SSL learning, a Dual-UNet is proposed to segment the instrument.
The Dual-UNet leverages unlabeled data using a novel hybrid loss function,

In addition, contextual constraints exploit the contextual information of the

uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments on multiple ex-vivo and in-vivo

  Applications","PhD Thesis",,,,"cs.LO cs.AI cs.DM cs.FL math.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This thesis introduces the ""method of structural refinement"", which serves as
a means of transforming the relational semantics of a modal and/or constructive
logic into an 'economical' proof system by connecting two proof-theoretic
paradigms: labelled and nested sequent calculi. The formalism of labelled
sequents has been successful in that cut-free calculi in possession of
desirable proof-theoretic properties can be automatically generated for large
classes of logics. Despite these qualities, labelled systems make use of a
complicated syntax that explicitly incorporates the semantics of the associated
logic, and such systems typically violate the subformula property to a high
degree. By contrast, nested sequent calculi employ a simpler syntax and adhere
to a strict reading of the subformula property, making such systems useful in
the design of automated reasoning algorithms. However, the downside of the
nested sequent paradigm is that a general theory concerning the automated
construction of such calculi (as in the labelled setting) is essentially
absent, meaning that the construction of nested systems and the confirmation of
their properties is usually done on a case-by-case basis. The refinement method
connects both paradigms in a fruitful way, by transforming labelled systems
into nested (or, refined labelled) systems with the properties of the former
preserved throughout the transformation process.
  To demonstrate the method of refinement and some of its applications, we
consider grammar logics, first-order intuitionistic logics, and deontic STIT
logics. The introduced refined labelled calculi will be used to provide the
first proof-search algorithms for deontic STIT logics. Furthermore, we employ
our refined labelled calculi for grammar logics to show that every logic in the
class possesses the effective Lyndon interpolation property.

unclear. Radio emission may be produced by a scaled-down version of the
relativistic jets observed in radio-loud (RL) AGN, an AGN-driven wind, the
accretion disc corona, AGN photon-ionisation of ambient gas (free-free
emission), or star formation (SF). Here, we report a pilot study, part of a
radio survey (`PG-RQS') aiming at exploring the spectral distributions of the
71 Palomar-Green (PG) RQQs: high angular resolution observations ($\sim$50 mas)
at 45~GHz (7 mm) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array of 15 sources.
Sub-mJy radio cores are detected in 13 sources on a typical scale of $\sim$100
pc, which excludes significant contribution from galaxy-scale SF. For 9 sources
the 45-GHz luminosity is above the lower frequency ($\sim$1-10 GHz) spectral
extrapolation, indicating the emergence of an additional flatter-spectrum
compact component at high frequencies. The X-ray luminosity and black hole (BH)
mass, correlate more tightly with the 45-GHz luminosity than the 5-GHz. The 45
GHz-based radio-loudness increases with decreasing Eddington ratio and
increasing BH mass M$_{\rm BH}$. These results suggest that the 45-GHz emission
from PG RQQs nuclei originates from the innermost region of the core, probably
from the accretion disc corona. Increasing contributions to 45-GHz emission
from a jet at higher M$_{\rm BH}$ and lower Eddington ratios and from a disc
wind at large Eddington ratios are still consistent with our results. Future
full radio spectral coverage of the sample will help us investigating the
different physical mechanisms in place in RQQ cores.

disc-fed systems. On the other hand, the noise spectrum tends to be white on
longer timescales with high timing noise level that indicates an ongoing
accretion process in between outburst episodes. For the second model, most of
the red noise component is eliminated and the noise spectrum is found to be
consistent with a white noise structure observed in wind-fed systems.

providing an expectation for the spatial distribution of the gas, thereby

of end nodes, long range, high resistance to multipath, low cost, and use of
license-free sub-GHz bands. Consequently, LoRaWAN is gradually replacing Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth in sundry IoT applications including utility metering, smart
cities, and localization. Localization, in particular, has already witnessed a
surge of alternatives to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), based on
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ultra Wide Band, 5G, etc. in indoor and low power domains due
to the poor indoor coverage and high power consumption of GNSS. With the need
for localization only shooting up with dense IoT deployments, LoRaWAN is seen
as a promising solution in this context. Indeed, many attempts employing
various techniques such as Time of Arrival (ToA), Time Difference of Arrival
(TDoA), and Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI) have been made to achieve
localization using LoRaWAN. However, a significant drawback in this scenario is
the lack of extensive data on path loss and signal propagation modeling,
particularly in Indian cityscapes. Another demerit is the use of GNSS at some
stage primarily for time synchronization of gateways. In this work, we attempt
to nullify these two disadvantages of LoRaWAN based localization. The first
part of this work presents experimental data of LoRaWAN transmissions inside a
typical city building to study signal propagation and path loss. The latter
part proposes a standalone GNSS-free localization approach using LoRaWAN that
is achieved by applying a collaborative, TDoA-based methodology. An additional
stationary node is introduced into the network to allow the synchronization of
gateways without GNSS. Finally, the distribution of localization error in a
triangle of gateways and the effect of timing resolution, time-on-air, and duty
cycle constraints on it are investigated.

velocity-resolved [C II] images have 0.55 pc spatial and 1 km/s velocity
resolutions.
  We find that Sgr B extends as a coherent structure spanning some 34 pc along
the Galactic plane. Bright [C II] emission encompasses Sgr B1 (G0.5-0.0), the
G0.6-0.0 HII region, and passes behind and beyond the luminous star forming
cores toward Sgr B2 (G0.7-0.0). Sgr B is a major contributor to the entire
Galactic center's [C II] luminosity, with surface brightness comparable to [C
II] from the Arches region.
  [C II], 70um, and 20cm emission share nearly identical spatial distributions.
Combined with the lack of [C II] self-absorption, this indicates that these
probes trace UV on the near surfaces of more extended clouds visible in CO
isotopologues and 160um continuum. Stars from regions of local star formation
likely dominate the UV field. Photodissociation regions and HII regions
contribute similar amounts of [C II] flux.
  The extreme star formation cores of Sgr B2 contribute negligible amounts to
the total [C II] intensity from the Sgr B region. Velocity fields and
association with a narrow dust lane indicate that they may have been produced
in a local cloud-cloud collision. The cores are likely local analogs of the
intense star formation regions where ideas to explain the ""C+ deficit"" in
ultra-luminous galaxies can be tested.

computing (MEC) systems emerged as a promising solution for providing
computation services to mobile users outside of terrestrial infrastructure
coverage. As each UAV operates independently, however, it is challenging to
meet the computation demands of the mobile users due to the limited computing
capacity at the UAV's MEC server as well as the UAV's energy constraint.
Therefore, collaboration among UAVs is needed. In this paper, a collaborative
multi-UAV-assisted MEC system integrated with a MEC-enabled terrestrial base
station (BS) is proposed. Then, the problem of minimizing the total latency
experienced by the mobile users in the proposed system is studied by optimizing
the offloading decision as well as the allocation of communication and
computing resources while satisfying the energy constraints of both mobile
users and UAVs. The proposed problem is shown to be a non-convex, mixed-integer
nonlinear problem (MINLP) that is intractable. Therefore, the formulated
problem is decomposed into three subproblems: i) users tasks offloading
decision problem, ii) communication resource allocation problem and iii)
UAV-assisted MEC decision problem. Then, the Lagrangian relaxation and
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) methods are applied to solve
the decomposed problems, alternatively. Simulation results show that the
proposed approach reduces the average latency by up to 40.7\% and 4.3\%
compared to the greedy and exhaustive search methods.

light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, complemented with data from
Swift and near-IR photometry are presented. The 350-day duration bolometric
light curve exhibits a relatively short (~ 65 days) plateau. This implies a
moderate ejecta mass (~ 5 Msun). A series of spectroscopy is presented,
including spectropolarimetric observations. The nebular spectra are dominated
by Halpha but also reveal emission lines from oxygen and calcium. Comparisons
to synthetic nebular spectra indicate an initial progenitor mass of about 12
Msun. Stable nickel is present in the nebular spectrum, with a super-solar
Ni/Fe ratio. Several years of pre-discovery data are examined, but no signs of
pre-cursor activity is found. Pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope imaging
reveals a probable progenitor star, detected only in the reddest band and is
fainter than expected for stars in the 10 - 15 Msun range, in tension with the
analysis of the LC and the nebular spectral modeling. We present two additional
core-collapse SNe monitored by the ZTF, which also have nebular
Halpha-dominated spectra. This illustrates how the absence or presence of
interaction with circumstellar material affect both the LCs and in particular
the nebular spectra. Type II SN 2020amv has a LC powered by CSM interaction, in
particular after about 40 days when the LC is bumpy and slowly evolving. The
late-time spectra show strong Halpha emission with a structure suggesting
emission from a thin, dense shell. The evolution of the complex three-horn line
profile is reminiscent of that observed for SN 1998S. SN 2020jfv has a poorly
constrained early-time LC, but shows a transition from a hydrogen-poor Type IIb

structure of the medium-Earth orbit (MEO) region remain hitherto unanswered.
This work describes in depth the effects of the $2g+h$ lunisolar resonance. In
particular, (i) we compute the correct forms of the separatrices of the
resonance in the inclination-eccentricity space for fixed semi-major axis. This
allows to compute the change in the width of the $2g+h$ resonance as the
altitude increases. (ii) We discuss the crucial role played by the value of the
inclination of the Laplace plane, $i_{L}$. Since $i_L$ is comparable to the
resonance's separatrix width, the parametrization of all resonance bifurcations
has to be done in terms of the proper inclination $i_{p}$, instead of the mean
one. (iii) The subset of circular orbits constitutes an invariant subspace
embedded in the full phase space, the center manifold $\mathcal{C}$. Using
$i_p$ as a label, we compute its range of values for which $\mathcal{C}$
becomes a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM). The structure of
invariant tori in $\mathcal{C}$ allows to explain the role of the initial phase
$h$ noticed in several works. (iv) Through Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI)
cartography, we portray the stable and unstable manifolds of the NHIM as the
altitude increases. Manifold oscillations dominate in phase space between
$a=24,000$ km and $a=30,000$ km as a result of the sweeping of the $2g+h$
resonance by the $h-\Omega_{\rm{Moon}}$ and $2h-\Omega_{\rm{Moon}}$ resonances.
The noticeable effects of the latter are explained as a consequence of the
relative inclination of the Moon's orbit with respect to the ecliptic. The role
of the phases $(h,\Omega_{\rm{Moon}})$ in the structures observed in the FLI
maps is also clarified. Finally,(v) we discuss how the understanding of the
manifold dynamics could inspire end-of-life disposal strategies.

(irreducible fixed points). For $N_{\Phi}=4$ we show that the S5 invariant
super Potts model is the only irreducible fixed point where the four scalar
superfields are fully interacting. For $N_{\Phi}=5$, we go through all Lie
subgroups of O(5) and then use the GAP system for computational discrete
algebra to study finite subgroups of O(5) up to order 800. This analysis gives
us three fully interacting irreducible fixed points. Of particular interest is
a subgroup of O(5) that exhibits O(3)/Z2 symmetry. It turns out this fixed
point can be generalized to a new family of models, with $N_{\Phi}=\frac{\rm
N(N-1)}{2}-1$ and O(N)/Z2 symmetry, that exists for arbitrary integer N$\geq3$.

the most critical one lies in the accuracy problem of filter representation.
Against this issue, in this paper we modify the classical Fourier series
expansion for 2D filters, and propose a new set of atomic basis functions for

finely represents 2D filters with zero error when the filter is not rotated,
but also substantially alleviates the fence-effect-caused quality degradation
when the filter is rotated. Accordingly, we construct a new equivariant
convolution method based on the proposed filter parametrization method, named
F-Conv. We prove that the equivariance of the proposed F-Conv is exact in the
continuous domain, which becomes approximate only after discretization.
Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed method.
Particularly, we adopt rotation equivariant convolution methods to image
super-resolution task, and F-Conv evidently outperforms previous filter
parametrization based method in this task, reflecting its intrinsic capability
of faithfully preserving rotation symmetries in local image features.

anti-de Sitter black hole, we thoroughly investigate the swallow tail behaviors
of the Gibbs free energy and the equal area laws. After obtaining the black
hole triple point, we exhibit its phase structures both in pressure-temperature
and temperature-horizon radius diagrams. Quite different from the liquid-vapor
phase transition, a double peak behavior is present in the temperature-horizon
radius phase diagram. Then we construct the Ruppeiner geometry and calculate
the corresponding normalized curvature scalar. Near the triple point, we
observe multiple negatively divergent behaviors. Positive curvature scalar is
observed for the small black hole with high temperature, which indicates that
the repulsive interaction dominates among the microstructure. Furthermore, we
consider the variation of the curvature scalar along the coexisting
intermediate and large black hole curves. Combining with the observation for
different fluids, the result suggests that this black hole system behaves more
like the argon or methane. Our study provides a first and preliminary step
towards understanding black hole microstructure near the triple point, as well

stars are believed to experience a common-envelope episode. During this
episode, the envelope of a giant star engulfs the whole binary. The energy
transferred from the orbit to the envelope by drag forces or from other energy
sources can eject the envelope from the binary system, leading to a stripped
short-period binary. In this paper, we use one-dimensional single stellar
evolution to explore the final stages of the common-envelope phase in
progenitors of neutron star binaries. We consider an instantaneously stripped
donor star as a proxy for the common-envelope phase and study the star's
subsequent radial evolution. We determine a range of stripping boundaries which
allow the star to avoid significant rapid re-expansion and which thus represent
plausible boundaries for the termination of the common-envelope episode. We
find that these boundaries lie above the maximum compression point, a commonly
used location of the core/envelope boundary. We conclude that stars may retain
fractions of a solar mass of hydrogen-rich material even after the
common-envelope episode. If we consider orbital energy as the only energy
source available, all of our models would overfill their Roche lobe after
ejecting the envelope, whose binding energy includes gravitational, thermal,

video clips and have to manually annotate the emotions they experienced while
watching the videos. Then, the common practice is to aggregate the different
annotations, by computing average scores or majority voting, and train and test
models on these aggregated annotations. With this procedure a single aggregated
evoked emotion annotation is obtained per each video. However, emotions
experienced while watching a video are subjective: different individuals might
experience different emotions. In this paper, we model the emotions evoked by
videos in a different manner: instead of modeling the aggregated value we
jointly model the emotions experienced by each viewer and the aggregated value
using a multi-task learning approach. Concretely, we propose two deep learning
architectures: a Single-Task (ST) architecture and a Multi-Task (MT)
architecture. Our results show that the MT approach can more accurately model
each viewer and the aggregated annotation when compared to methods that are
directly trained on the aggregated annotations. Furthermore, our approach
outperforms the current state-of-the-art results on the COGNIMUSE benchmark.

Spain, one of the countries which have been most impacted by the pandemic.
  On the one hand, we study the impact of the pandemic in the financial
backbone of the Open Web, the online advertising business. To this end, we
leverage concepts from Supply-Demand economic theory to perform a careful
analysis of the elasticity in the supply of ad-spaces to the financial shortage
of the online advertising business and its subsequent reduction in ad spaces'
price. On the other hand, we analyze the distribution of the Open Web
composition across business categories and its evolution during the COVID-19
pandemic. These analyses are conducted between Jan 1st and Dec 31st, 2020,
using a reference dataset comprising information from more than 18 billion ad
spaces.
  Our results indicate that the Open Web has experienced a moderate shift in
its composition across business categories. However, this change is not
produced by the financial shortage of the online advertising business, because
as our analysis shows, the Open Web's supply of ad spaces is inelastic (i.e.,
insensitive) to the sustained low-price of ad spaces during the pandemic.

  Covariance Structure","26 pages, 6 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper introduces a method for studying the correlation structure of a
range of responses modelled by a multivariate generalised linear mixed model
(MGLMM). The methodology requires the existence of clusters of observations and
that each of the several responses studied is modelled using a generalised
linear mixed models (GLMM) containing random components representing the
clusters. We construct a MGLMM by assuming that the distribution of each of the
random components representing the clusters is the marginal distribution of a
(sufficiently regular) multivariate elliptically contoured distribution. We use
an undirected graphical model to represent the correlation structure of the
random components representing the clusters of observations for each response.
This representation allows us to draw conclusions regarding unknown underlying
determining factors related to the clusters of observations. Using a
combination of an undirected graph and a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we
jointly represent the correlation structure of the responses and the related
random components. Applying the theory of graphical models allows us to
describe and draw conclusions on the correlation and, in some cases, the
dependence between responses of different statistical nature (\eg following
different distributions, different linear predictors and link functions). We
present some simulation studies illustrating the proposed methodology.

of logarithmic durations of long GRBs is asymmetric rather than Gaussian. Such
an asymmetry, when modelled with a mixture of Gaussian distributions, requires
an introduction of an additional component, often associated with another class
of GRBs. However, when modelled with inherently asymmetric distributions, there
is no need for such a component. The cosmological dilation was already ruled
out as a source of the asymmetry, hence its origin resides in the progenitors.
GRB light curves (LCs) are usually well described by a series of
fast-rise-exponential-decay pulses. A statistical analysis of ensembles of
simulated LCs shows that the asymmetry is a natural consequence of the pulse
shape and the multi-pulse character of the LCs.

several vision-related applications, their potential in generating artistic

Art - a unique form of sculptural art where 2D shadows cast by a 3D sculpture
produce artistic effects. In this work, we revisit shadow art using
differentiable rendering based optimization frameworks to obtain the 3D
sculpture from a set of shadow (binary) images and their corresponding
projection information. Specifically, we discuss shape optimization through
voxel as well as mesh-based differentiable renderers. Our choice of using
differentiable rendering for generating shadow art sculptures can be attributed
to its ability to learn the underlying 3D geometry solely from image data, thus
reducing the dependence on 3D ground truth. The qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework in generating
complex 3D sculptures that go beyond those seen in contemporary art pieces
using just a set of shadow images as input. Further, we demonstrate the
generation of 3D sculptures to cast shadows of faces, animated movie

for gamma-ray astronomy at very high energies. The atmosphere is an integral
part of every Cherenkov telescope. Different atmospheric conditions, such as
clouds, can reduce the fraction of Cherenkov photons produced in air showers
that reach ground-based telescopes, which may affect the performance. Decreased
sensitivity of the telescopes may lead to misconstructed energies and spectra.
This study presents the impact of various atmospheric conditions on CTA
performance. The atmospheric transmission in a cloudy atmosphere in the
wavelength range from 203 nm to 1000 nm was simulated for different cloud bases
and different optical depths using the MODerate resolution atmospheric
TRANsmission (MODTRAN) code. MODTRAN output files were used as inputs for
generic Monte Carlo simulations. The analysis was performed using the MAGIC
Analysis and Reconstruction Software (MARS) adapted for CTA. As expected, the
effects of clouds are most evident at low energies, near the energy threshold.
Even in the presence of dense clouds, high-energy gamma rays may still trigger
the telescopes if the first interaction occurs lower in the atmosphere, below
the cloud base. A method to analyze very high-energy data obtained in the
presence of clouds is presented. The systematic uncertainties of the method are
evaluated. These studies help to gain more precise knowledge about the CTA
response to cloudy conditions and give insights on how to proceed with data
obtained in such conditions. This may prove crucial for alert-based
observations and time-critical studies of transient phenomena.

the chemical potential dependence of the condensates at the boundaries of the

the mild chiral restoration, and the significant chiral condensate remains to
baryon density $n_B \sim 2-3n_0$ ($n_0\simeq 0.16\,{\rm fm}^{-3}$: nuclear

chiral restoration effects; the first is associated with the positive scalar
density in a nucleon, relevant in dilute regime, and the other primarily arises

polymerisation, and we investigate how the active drop motion is altered by
these surface forces. We find a highly non-linear response to forces that we
characterise using drop velocity, drop shape, and the traction between the drop
and the substrate. Each self-propulsion mechanism gives rise to two main modes
of motion: a long thin drop with zero traction in the bulk, mostly occurring
under strong stretching forces, and a parabolic drop with finite traction in
the bulk, mostly occurring under strong squeezing forces. In each case there is
a sharp transition between parabolic, and long thin drops as a function of the
applied forces and indications of drop break-up where large forces stretch the

variable energy resources (such as wind and solar) are expected to introduce
unprecedented levels of uncertainty into power system operations. The current
practice of operations planning with deterministic optimization models may be
ill-suited for a future with abundant uncertainty. To overcome the potential
reliability and economic challenges, we present a stochastic hierarchical
planning (SHP) framework. This framework captures operations at day-ahead,
short-term and hour-ahead timescales, along with the interactions between the
stochastic processes and decisions. In contrast to earlier studies where
stochastic optimization of individual problems (e.g., unit commitment, economic
dispatch) have been studied, this paper studies an integrated framework of
\emph{planning under uncertainty}, where stochastic optimization models are
stitched together in a hierarchical setting which parallels the deterministic
hierarchical planning approach that is widely adopted in the power industry.
Our experiments, based on the NREL-118 dataset, reveal that under high
renewable penetration, significant operational improvements can be expected by
transitioning to the SHP paradigm. In particular, the computational results
show that significant improvements can be achieved in several metrics,
including system reliability, environmental sustainability, and system
economics, solely by making a strategic choice to adopt the new SHP paradigm.

we construct rigorous and covariant formulations of time-slicing path integrals
for quantum and classical stochastic dynamics in curved space. We first
establish a rigorous criterion for correct time-slice actions of path integrals
(Lemma 1). This implies the existence of infinitely many equivalent
representations for time-slicing path integral. We then show that, for any

equivalent to a Gaussian (Lemma 2). Using these results, we further construct a
continuous family of equivalent actions parameterized by an interpolation
parameter $\alpha \in [0,1]$ (Lemma 3). The action generically contains a
spurious drift term linear in $\Delta \boldsymbol x$, whose concrete form
depends on $\alpha$. Finally we also establish the covariance of our
path-integral formalism, by demonstrating how the action transforms under
nonlinear transform of variables. The $\alpha = 0$ representation of time-slice
action is particularly convenient because it is Gaussian and invariant, as long

believed to be rare in non-integrable ones such as nonlinear Klein-Gordon
equations. In this paper we consider small breathers for semilinear
Klein-Gordon equations with analytic odd nonlinearities. A breather with small
amplitude exists only when its temporal frequency is close to be resonant with
the linear Klein-Gordon dispersion relation. Our main result is that, for such
frequencies, we rigorously identify the leading order term in the exponentially
small (with respect to the small amplitude) obstruction to the existence of
small breathers in terms of the so-called Stokes constant which depends on the
nonlinearity analytically, but is independent of the frequency. As a corollary
it proves that, for generic analytic odd nonlinearities, there does not exist
any {\it small} breather of {\it any} temporal frequency, even though this had
been intuitive for any single given frequency due to the dimension counting. In
particular, this gives a rigorous justification of a formal asymptotic argument
by Kruskal and Segur \cite{KS87} in the analysis of small breathers.
  We rely on the spatial dynamics approach where breathers can be seen as
homoclinic orbits. The birth of such small homoclinics is analyzed via a
singular perturbation setting where a Bogdanov-Takens type bifurcation is
coupled to infinitely many rapidly oscillatory directions. The leading order
term of the exponentially small splitting between the stable/unstable invariant
manifolds is obtained through a careful analysis of the analytic continuation
of their parameterizations. This requires the study of another limit equation
in the complexified evolution variable, the so-called \emph{inner equation}.

the user to investigate critical windows of exposure, defined as the time
period during which exposure to a pollutant adversely affects health outcomes.
Recent studies have focused on estimating the health effects of a large number
of environmental exposures, or an environmental mixture, on health outcomes. In
such settings, it is important to understand which environmental exposures
affect a particular outcome, while acknowledging the possibility that different
exposures have different critical windows. Further, in the studies of
environmental mixtures, it is important to identify interactions among
exposures, and to account for the fact that this interaction may occur between
two exposures having different critical windows. Exposure to one exposure early
in time could cause an individual to be more or less susceptible to another
exposure later in time. We propose a Bayesian model to estimate the temporal
effects of a large number of exposures on an outcome. We use spike-and-slab

exposures and exposure interactions, and discuss extensions with improved power
to detect harmful exposures. We then apply these methods to estimate the

proposing a novel dynamically quantized SGD (DQ-SGD) framework, enabling us to
dynamically adjust the quantization scheme for each gradient descent step by
exploring the trade-off between communication cost and convergence error. We
derive an upper bound, tight in some cases, of the convergence error for a
restricted family of quantization schemes and loss functions. We design our
DQ-SGD algorithm via minimizing the communication cost under the convergence
error constraints. Finally, through extensive experiments on large-scale
natural language processing and computer vision tasks on AG-News, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets, we demonstrate that our quantization scheme achieves better
tradeoffs between the communication cost and learning performance than other
state-of-the-art gradient quantization methods.

However, in the presence of gauge symmetry, common but not limited to

be projectively represented, giving rise to unprecedented topological physics.
Here we demonstrate this novel idea by exploiting a projective translation

planetary weather and climate, due to the effects of planetary rotation, uneven
stellar flux distribution, fluid motion instability, etc. In this study, we
investigate the asymmetry and variability in the transmission spectra of 1:1
spin--orbit tidally locked (or called synchronously rotating) planets around
low-mass stars. We find that for rapidly rotating planets, the transit
atmospheric thickness on the evening terminator (east of the substellar region)
is significantly larger than that of the morning terminator (west of the
substellar region). The asymmetry is mainly related to the spatial
heterogeneity in ice clouds, as the contributions of liquid clouds and water
vapor are smaller. The underlying mechanism is that there are always more ice
clouds on the evening terminator, due to the combined effect of coupled
Rossby--Kelvin waves and equatorial superrotation that advect vapor and clouds
to the east, especially at high levels of the atmosphere. For slowly rotating
planets, the asymmetry reverses (the morning terminator has a larger
transmission depth than the evening terminator) but the magnitude is small or
even negligible. For both rapidly and slowly rotating planets, there is strong
variability in the transmission spectra. The asymmetry signal is nearly
impossible to be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), because the
magnitude of the asymmetry (about 10 ppm) is smaller than the instrumental
noise and the high variability further increases the challenge.

imprints in the light curve even if they do not transit. These are the
so-called phase curve variations that include ellipsoidal, reflection and
beaming effects. In Millholland & Laughlin (2017), the authors scrutinized the
Kepler database looking for these phase variations from non-transiting planets.
They found 60 candidates whose signals were compatible with planetary
companions. In this paper, we perform a ground-based follow-up of a sub-sample
of these systems with the aim of confirming and characterizing these planets
and thus validating the detection technique. We used the CAFE and HERMES

candidates along their orbits. We additionally used AstraLux to obtain
high-resolution images of some of these candidates to discard blended binaries
that contaminate the Kepler light curves by mimicking planetary signals. Among
the ten systems, we confirm three new hot-Jupiters (KIC8121913 b, KIC10068024

pulsating star, believed to be proto-white dwarfs, produced by mass stripping
of a red giant when it has a small helium core. An outstanding question is why
the stars in this class of pulsator seem to form two distinct groups by surface
gravity, despite predictions that stars in the gap between them should also
pulsate. We use a binary population synthesis model to identify potential
evolutionary pathways that a star can take to become a BLAP. We find that BLAPs
can be produced either through common envelope evolution or Roche lobe
overflow, with a Main Sequence star or an evolved compact object being
responsible for the envelope stripping. The mass distribution of the inferred
population indicates that fewer stars would be expected in the range of masses
intermediate to the two known groups of pulsators, suggesting that the lack of
observational discoveries in this region may be a result of the underlying
population of pre-white dwarf stars. We also consider metallicity variation and
find evidence that BLAPs at $Z = 0.010$ (half-Solar) would be pulsationally
unstable and may also be more common. Based on this analysis, we expect the
Milky Way to host around 12000 BLAPs and we predict the number density of
sources expected in future observations such as the Legacy Survey of Space and
Time at the Vera Rubin Observatory.

relativistic jets emerging from a super-massive black hole and forming a small

to flaring activity as they exhibit large flux variations over a wide range of
frequency and on multiple timescales, ranging from a few minutes to several
months. The detection of a high-energy neutrino from the flaring blazar TXS
0506+056 and the subsequent discovery of a neutrino excess from the same
direction have naturally strengthened the hypothesis that blazars are cosmic
neutrino sources. While neutrino production during gamma-ray flares has been
widely discussed, the neutrino yield of X-ray flares has received less
attention. Motivated by a theoretical scenario where high energy neutrinos are
produced by energetic protons interacting with their own X-ray synchrotron
radiation, we make neutrino predictions over a sample of a sample of X-ray
blazars. This sample consists of all blazars observed with the X-ray Telescope
(XRT) on board Swift more than 50 times from November 2004 to November 2020.
The statistical identification of a flaring state is done using the Bayesian
Block algorithm to the 1 keV XRT light curves of frequently observed blazars.
We categorize flaring states into classes based on their variation from the
time-average value of the data points. During each flaring state, we compute
the expected muon plus anti-muon neutrino events as well as the total signal
for each source using the point-source effective area of Icecube for different
operational seasons. We find that the median of the total neutrino number (in
logarithm) from flares with duration $<30$ d is $\mathcal{N}^{(\rm

clarifying some important points in that scenario, not covered by our previous

introduce the notion of chiral symmetry of a network, and study its
implications regarding the relative chiral signs adopted by different groups of
molecules. We then propose a generalization of Frank's model for large chemical

to induce anomalous diffusion in the maps' phase spaces, as opposed to normal
diffusion which is associated with Gaussian distribution properties of the
kinematic variables. This type of transport originates in the presence of the
so-called accelerator modes, i.e.~non-chaotic initial conditions which exhibit
ballistic transport, which also affect the dynamics in their vicinity. We first
systematically study the dynamics of single standard maps, investigating the
impact of different ensembles of initial conditions on their behavior and
asymptotic diffusion rates, as well as on the respective time-scales needed to
acquire these rates. We consider sets of initial conditions in chaotic regions
enclosing accelerator modes, which are not bounded by invariant tori. These
types of chaotic initial conditions typically lead to normal diffusion
transport. We then setup different arrangements of coupled standard maps and
investigate their global diffusion properties and chaotic dynamics. Although
individual maps bear accelerator modes causing anomalous transport, the global
diffusion behavior of the coupled system turns out to depend on the specific
configuration of the imposed coupling. Estimating the average diffusion
properties for ensembles of initial conditions, as well as measuring the
strength of chaos through computations of appropriate indicators, we find
conditions and systems' arrangements which systematically favor the suppression

automatically extracts categorical and numerical parameters such as (i) the

single-field $\phi^4$ model, this model has twelve kinks, which are classified
into chiral and nonchiral kinks depending on their topological chiral charges.
This enriches the variety of the collision processes. From the numerical
simulation, we observe three kinds of collisions depending on the initial
configuration and initial velocities of colliding kinks. During a collision,
the topological chiral charges of kinks switch while preserving the $Z_4$
abelian group operation. To understand the collision and chirality switching
mechanism, we investigate the detailed collision process, energy densities, the
field gradients, internal modes, energy exchange between two fields, coherent
vibration of two bions located in different fields, and the orbits of colliding
kinks in the two-dimensional field space.

operations, such as bank transactions and call center conversations. The
vulnerability of automatic speaker verification systems (ASVs) to spoofing
attacks instigated the development of countermeasures (CMs), whose task is to
tell apart bonafide and spoofed speech. Together, ASVs and CMs form today's
voice authentication platforms, advertised as an impregnable access control
mechanism. We develop the first practical attack on CMs, and show how a
malicious actor may efficiently craft audio samples to bypass voice
authentication in its strictest form. Previous works have primarily focused on
non-proactive attacks or adversarial strategies against ASVs that do not
produce speech in the victim's voice. The repercussions of our attacks are far
more severe, as the samples we generate sound like the victim, eliminating any
chance of plausible deniability. Moreover, the few existing adversarial attacks
against CMs mistakenly optimize spoofed speech in the feature space and do not
take into account the existence of ASVs, resulting in inferior synthetic audio
that fails in realistic settings. We eliminate these obstacles through our key
technical contribution: a novel joint loss function that enables mounting
advanced adversarial attacks against combined ASV/CM deployments directly in
the time domain. Our adversarials achieve concerning black-box success rates
against state-of-the-art authentication platforms (up to 93.57\%). Finally, we
perform the first targeted, over-telephony-network attack on CMs, bypassing
several challenges and enabling various potential threats, given the increased
use of voice biometrics in call centers. Our results call into question the
security of modern voice authentication systems in light of the real threat of
attackers bypassing these measures to gain access to users' most valuable

protected by the defects symmetry, the spin coherence is susceptible to rapid

operating at very low temperatures or by introducing large strain. However,
both methods have significant drawbacks, the former requires use of dilution

within a logistic regression framework, which enables us to use the Polya-Gamma
scheme to perform inference quickly and efficiently, even for very large data
sets. Spatial and temporal random effects are modelled using Gaussian
processes, allowing us to infer the strength of spatio-temporal autocorrelation
from the data. We apply our model to data on two UK butterfly species, one
common and widespread and one rare, using records from the Butterflies for the
New Millennium database, producing occupancy indices spanning 45 years. Our
framework can be applied to a wide range of taxa, providing measures of
variation in species' occurrence, which are used to assess biodiversity change.

world-locked effects instantly. However, standard visual odometry or SLAM
algorithms require motion parallax to initialize (see Figure 1) and, therefore,
suffer from delayed initialization. In this paper, we present a 6-DoF monocular
visual odometry that initializes instantly and without motion parallax. Our
main contribution is a pose estimator that decouples estimating the 5-DoF
relative rotation and translation direction from the 1-DoF translation
magnitude. While scale is not observable in a monocular vision-only setting, it
is still paramount to estimate a consistent scale over the whole trajectory
(even if not physically accurate) to avoid AR effects moving erroneously along
depth. In our approach, we leverage the fact that depth errors are not
perceivable to the user during rotation-only motion. However, as the user
starts translating the device, depth becomes perceivable and so does the
capability to estimate consistent scale. Our proposed algorithm naturally
transitions between these two modes. We perform extensive validations of our
contributions with both a publicly available dataset and synthetic data. We
show that the proposed pose estimator outperforms the classical approaches for
6-DoF pose estimation used in the literature in low-parallax configurations. We
release a dataset for the relative pose problem using real data to facilitate
the comparison with future solutions for the relative pose problem. Our
solution is either used as a full odometry or as a preSLAM component of any

roughness elements on the trailing edge near- and far-field noise. So far, the
influence of roughness on the wall pressure fluctuations and spanwise coherence

the effects of surface roughness geometries of different heights on the
trailing edge wall pressure fluctuations, the spanwise coherence, and the
far-field noise. Wind tunnel experiments were performed adopting zigzag strips
and novel sharkskin-like surface roughness installed in a NACA 0012 at zero
angle of attack. The tested surface roughness heights ranged from 29% to 233%
of the undisturbed boundary layer thickness. The wall pressure fluctuations and
the far-field noise were measured for Reynolds numbers from 1.3x10^5 to
3.3x10^5. It was observed that the surface roughness affects the low- and
high-frequency range of the wall pressure spectrum, with trip heights in the
range from 50% to 110% of the undisturbed boundary layer thickness having a
slight level increase for low frequencies and no difference for high
frequencies. The far-field noise increased for low and high frequencies as the
trip height increased. The low-frequency increase is a consequence of the trip
effects on the trailing edge wall pressure fluctuations, whereas for high
frequencies the increase is due to the noise generated by the trip itself.

dependent data. The primary setting considered here is with spatially indexed
data in which the dependence structure of observed random variables is
characterized by a known, observed dissimilarity measure over spatial indices.
Observations are partitioned into clusters with the use of an unsupervised
clustering algorithm applied to the dissimilarity measure. Once the partition
into clusters is learned, a cluster-based inference procedure is applied to a
statistical hypothesis testing procedure. The procedure proposed in the paper
allows the number of clusters to depend on the data, which gives researchers a
principled method for choosing an appropriate clustering level. The paper gives
conditions under which the proposed procedure asymptotically attains correct
size. A simulation study shows that the proposed procedure attains near nominal
size in finite samples in a variety of statistical testing problems with

its dynamics to a time-independent stationary state. In turn, the optimal
resetting rate makes the mean time to reach a target to be the shortest one.
These and other intriguing problems have been intensively studied in the case
of ordinary diffusive processes over the last decade. In this paper we consider
the influence of stochastic resetting on a diffusive motion modeled in terms of
the non-linear differential equation. The reason for its non-linearity is the
power-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the probability density
function or, in another context, the concentration of particles. We briefly
outline this issue at first to prepare the foundations for our further
considerations. Then, we derive an exact formula for the mean squared
displacement and demonstrate how it attains the steady-state value under the
influence of exponential resetting. This mechanism brings also about that the
spatial support of the probability density function, which for the free
non-linear diffusion is confined to the set of a finite measure, tends to span
the entire domain of real numbers. In addition, we explore the first-passage
properties for the non-linear diffusion intermittent by the exponential
resetting and find analytical expressions for the mean first-passage time and
determine numerically the optimal resetting rate which minimizes the mean time
needed for a particle to reach a pre-determined target. Finally, we test and
confirm the universal property that the relative fluctuation in the mean
first-passage time of optimally restarted non-linear diffusion is equal to
unity.

ever-increasing customer populations, this is hard to accomplish without
extensive customer base studies. There is a need for an automated method for
identifying these expectations at a large scale. For this, we used a
data-driven approach to our analysis. Our study analyzed their satisfaction
factors comparing soft attributes, such as service, with hard attributes, such
as location and facilities, and studied different price ranges. We collected
hotel reviews and extracted keywords to classify the sentiment of sentences
with an SVC. We then used dependency parsing and part-of-speech tagging to
extract nouns tied to positive adjectives. We found that Chinese tourists
consider room quality more than hospitality, whereas Westerners are delighted
more by staff behavior. Furthermore, the lack of a Chinese-friendly environment
for Chinese customers and cigarette smell for Western ones can be disappointing
factors of their stay. As one of the first studies in the tourism field to use
the high-standard Japanese hospitality environment for this analysis, our
cross-cultural study contributes to both the theoretical understanding of
satisfaction and suggests practical applications and strategies for hotel

to a new powder material system is controlling the preheating conditions such
that every layer of powder results in enough partial sintering to create a
coherent powder cake. To be able to understand the powder sintering process and
adapt it to other materials, we must look at the degree of sintering and the
effective thermal conductivity of the powder bed. An in-depth understanding of
these characteristics will help tailor the preheating conditions and
furthermore, make it easier to remove/de-powder intricate parts after build
completion without compromising the advantages of the preheating phenomenon.
This study evaluates the impact of preheating temperature on the in-situ powder
cake properties. Three different preheat temperatures, 650 {\deg}C, 690 {\deg}C
and 730 {\deg}C, are employed to a Ti-6Al-4V powder cake and in each standalone
build, unique powder-capture artefacts are fabricated to be able to analyze the

empirically-derived model for thermal conductivity of the powder cake as a
result of changing the preheating temperatures, was obtained. The results
demonstrated that the effective thermal conductivity of the powder cake at a
given preheating temperature strongly depends on the packing density, contact
size ratio and coordination number. An increase in preheating temperature, lead
to a linear increase in the packing density (from 58.42% to 61.87%), contact
size ratio (from 0.45 to 0.48), coordination number (from 3.36 to 3.58) and the

agreement with ab-initio predictions up to higher densities and temperatures,

robot navigation, semantic perception, manipulation, and telepresence. Several
methods of combining range- and color-data have been investigated and
successfully used in various robotic applications. Most of these systems suffer
from the problems of noise in the range-data and resolution mismatch between
the range sensor and the color cameras, since the resolution of current range
sensors is much less than the resolution of color cameras. High-resolution
depth maps can be obtained using stereo matching, but this often fails to
construct accurate depth maps of weakly/repetitively textured scenes, or if the
scene exhibits complex self-occlusions. Range sensors provide coarse depth
information regardless of presence/absence of texture. The use of a calibrated
system, composed of a time-of-flight (TOF) camera and of a stereoscopic camera
pair, allows data fusion thus overcoming the weaknesses of both individual
sensors. We propose a novel TOF-stereo fusion method based on an efficient
seed-growing algorithm which uses the TOF data projected onto the stereo image
pair as an initial set of correspondences. These initial ""seeds"" are then
propagated based on a Bayesian model which combines an image similarity score
with rough depth priors computed from the low-resolution range data. The
overall result is a dense and accurate depth map at the resolution of the color
cameras at hand. We show that the proposed algorithm outperforms 2D image-based
stereo algorithms and that the results are of higher resolution than
off-the-shelf color-range sensors, e.g., Kinect. Moreover, the algorithm
potentially exhibits real-time performance on a single CPU.

line with the number and average size of operating turbines. A lower specific
power, i.e. larger rotor blades relative to wind turbine capacities, allows to
increase capacity factors and to reduce LCOE. However, this development also
reduces system efficiency, i.e. the share of power in the wind flowing through
rotor swept areas which is converted to electricity. At the same time, this may
also decrease output power density, the amount of electric power generated per
unit of rotor swept area.
  In this study, we present a decomposition of historical US wind power
generation data for the period 2001--2021 to examine to which extent the
decrease in specific power affected system efficiency and output power density.
We show that as a result of a decrease in specific power, system efficiency
fell and therefore, output power density was reduced during the last decade.
Furthermore, we show that the wind available to turbines has increased
substantially due to increases in the average hub height of turbines since
2001. However, site quality has slightly decreased during the last 20 years.

achieve the same performance as fully-digital beamforming, with reduced number

this article proposes two efficient spectral clustering approaches based on
regularized Laplacian matrix, Simplex Regularized Spectral Clustering (SRSC)
and Cone Regularized Spectral Clustering (CRSC). SRSC and CRSC methods are
designed based on the ideal simplex structure and the ideal cone structure in
the variants of the eigen-decomposition of the population regularized Laplacian
matrix. We show that these two approaches SRSC and CRSC are asymptotically
consistent under mild conditions by providing error bounds for the inferred
membership vector of each node under MMSB. Through the theoretical analysis, we
give the upper and lower bound for the regularizer $\tau$. By introducing a
parametric convergence probability, we can directly see that when $\tau$ is
large these two methods may still have low error rates but with a smaller
probability. Thus we give an empirical optimal choice of $\tau$ is $O(log(n))$
with $n$ the number of nodes to detect sparse networks. The proposed two
approaches are successfully applied to synthetic and empirical networks with
encouraging results compared with some benchmark methods.

that neural networks are overly confident about their prediction and are
therefore an untrustworthy source to assess sample informativeness. In this
paper, we propose a new informativeness-based active learning method. Our
measure is derived from the learning dynamics of a neural network. More
precisely we track the label assignment of the unlabeled data pool during the
training of the algorithm. We capture the learning dynamics with a metric
called label-dispersion, which is low when the network consistently assigns the
same label to the sample during the training of the network and high when the
assigned label changes frequently. We show that label-dispersion is a promising
predictor of the uncertainty of the network, and show on two benchmark datasets
that an active learning algorithm based on label-dispersion obtains excellent
results.

hole (SMBH) binary, which itself eventually coalesces through the anisotropic
emission of gravitational waves. This may result in the merged SMBH receiving a
recoil kick velocity ~100 - 1000 km/s, causing it to oscillate in the
gravitational potential of the host galaxy. The luminous quasar E1821+643,
identified as an SMBH recoil candidate via spectropolarimetry observations,
shows Doppler shifting of the broad emission lines in direct and scattered
light, consistent with a relative velocity of 2100 km/s between the quasar
nucleus and host galaxy. In this paper, we attempt to detect the expected
spatial displacement using a combination of optical spectroastrometry and
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) narrow band images. The spectroastrometry reveals
a relative spatial displacement between the quasar nucleus and the gas emitting
the [OIII]4959,5007 lines of ~130mas (~580pc) to the North-West. Our HST images
resolve the [OIII] emission on sub-arcsecond scales, showing that it is
asymmetrically distributed, extending to radial distances ~0.5 - 0.6"" from the
nucleus in a wide arc running from the North-East around to the West. A
simulated spectroastrometry observation based on the HST [OIII] image indicates
that only a small fraction of the measured displacement can be attributed to
the asymmetric [OIII] emission. This displacement therefore appears to be a
real spatial offset of the quasar nucleus with respect to the narrow-line
region, presumed to be located at the host galaxy center, further supporting
the interpretation that a post-merger gravitational recoil of the SMBH has
occurred in E1821+643.

storms and injection events in the far ultraviolet aurora several times during
the observation period. Magnetic reconnection occurring in the middle
magnetosphere caused by internal drivers is thought to start the production of
those features. The field lines then dipolarize which injects hot
magnetospheric plasma from the reconnection site to enter the inner
magnetosphere. Hisaki observed an impulsive brightening in the dawnside Io
plasma torus (IPT) during the final appearance of the dawn storms and injection
events which is evidence that a large-scale plasma injection penetrated the
central IPT between 6-9 RJ (Jupiter radii). The extreme ultraviolet aurora
brightened and XMM-Newton detected an increase in the hard X-ray aurora count
rate, suggesting an increase in electron precipitation. The dawn storms and
injections did not change the brightness of the soft X-ray aurora and they did
not ""switch-on"" its commonly observed quasi-periodic pulsations. Spectral
analysis of the X-ray aurora suggests that the precipitating ions responsible
for the soft X-ray aurora were iogenic and that a powerlaw continuum was needed
to fit the hard X-ray part of the spectra. The spectra coincident with the dawn
storms and injections required two powerlaw continua to get good fits.

want to use pre-existing maps or create new ones in the context of SLAM. Today,
many robotic platforms are equipped with high-accuracy 3D LiDAR sensors, which
allow a geometric mapping, and cameras able to provide semantic cues of the
environment. Segment-based mapping and localization have been applied with
great success to 3D point-cloud data, while semantic understanding has been
shown to improve localization performance in vision based systems. In this
paper we combine both modalities in SemSegMap, extending SegMap into a segment
based mapping framework able to also leverage color and semantic data from the
environment to improve localization accuracy and robustness. In particular, we
present new segmentation and descriptor extraction processes. The segmentation
process benefits from additional distance information from color and semantic
class consistency resulting in more repeatable segments and more overlap after
re-visiting a place. For the descriptor, a tight fusion approach in a
deep-learned descriptor extraction network is performed leading to a higher
descriptiveness for landmark matching. We demonstrate the advantages of this
fusion on multiple simulated and real-world datasets and compare its
performance to various baselines. We show that we are able to find 50.9% more
high-accuracy prior-less global localizations compared to SegMap on challenging
datasets using very compact maps while also providing accurate full 6 DoF pose
estimates in real-time.

new length scale to the material. At the 'magic' twist angle of 1.1{\deg}, this
causes a flat band to form, yielding emergent properties such as correlated
insulator behavior and superconductivity [1-4]. In general, the moir\'e
structure in TBG varies spatially, influencing the local electronic properties
[5-9] and hence the outcome of macroscopic charge transport experiments. In
particular, to understand the wide variety observed in the phase diagrams and
critical temperatures, a more detailed understanding of the local moir\'e
variation is needed [10]. Here, we study spatial and temporal variations of the
moir\'e pattern in TBG using aberration-corrected Low Energy Electron
Microscopy (AC-LEEM) [11,12]. The spatial variation we find is lower than
reported previously. At 500{\deg}C, we observe thermal fluctuations of the
moir\'e lattice, corresponding to collective atomic displacements of less than
70pm on a time scale of seconds [13], homogenizing the sample. Despite previous
concerns, no untwisting of the layers is found, even at temperatures as high as
600{\deg}C [14,15]. From these observations, we conclude that thermal annealing
can be used to decrease the local disorder in TBG samples. Finally, we report
the existence of individual edge dislocations in the atomic and moir\'e
lattice. These topological defects break translation symmetry and are
anticipated to exhibit unique local electronic properties.

employing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with single
alkaline-earth-metal atom trapped in an optical cavity. In the presence of
optical Stark shift, both second-order correlation function and cavity
transmission exhibit asymmetric structures between the red and blue sidebands
of the cavity. For a weak control field, the photon quantum statistics for the
coherent transparency window (i.e. atomic quasi-dark state resonance) are
insensitive to the Stark shift, which should also be immune to the spontaneous
emission of the excited state by taking advantage of the intrinsic dark-state
polariton of EIT. Interestingly, by exploiting the interplay between Stark
shift and control field, the strong photon blockade at atomic quasi-dark state
resonance has an optimal second-order correlation function
$g^{(2)}(0)\sim10^{-4}$ and a high cavity transmission simultaneously. The
underlying physical mechanism is ascribed to the Stark shift enhanced spectrum
anharmonicity and the EIT hosted strong nonlinearity with loss-insensitive
atomic quasi-dark state resonance, which is essentially different from the
conventional proposal with emerging Kerr nonlinearity in cavity-EIT. Our
results reveal a new strategy to realize high-quality single photon sources,
which could open up a new avenue for engineering nonclassical quantum states in
cavity quantum electrodynamics.

leverage 2D data for 3D domain adaptation by intra and inter domain cross modal
learning. As for intra-domain cross modal learning, most existing works sample
the dense 2D pixel-wise features into the same size with sparse 3D point-wise
features, resulting in the abandon of numerous useful 2D features. To address
this problem, we propose Dynamic sparse-to-dense Cross Modal Learning (DsCML)

domain adaptation. For inter-domain cross modal learning, we further advance
Cross Modal Adversarial Learning (CMAL) on 2D and 3D data which contains
different semantic content aiming to promote high-level modal complementarity.

luminosities for several low-mass stars -- one and two solar masses stars in
the main sequence and post-main sequence stages of evolution. Equally, we also
compute the x-ray excess emission resulting from the conversion of axions back
to photons in the presence of a strong magnetic field in the envelope of these
stars. Hence, a given star will have a unique axion spectrum and $L_a$ axion
luminosity. And if such star has a strong magnetic field in its stellar
envelope, it will also show a characteristic x-ray spectrum and $L_{a\gamma}$
x-ray luminosity. Such radiation will add up to the x-ray electromagnetic
spectrum and $L_X$ luminosity of the star. The present study focuses on axion
models with an axion-photon coupling constant, $5\;10^{-11} {\rm GeV}^{-1}$, a
value just below the most recent upper limit of $6.6\;10^{-11} {\rm GeV}^{-1}$
found by CAST and IAXO helioscopes. The range of axion parameters discussed
here spans many axion models' parameter space, including the DFSZ and KSVZ
models. We found that axions with a mass in the range $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-5}\;
{\rm eV}$ and an axion-photon coupling constant of $5\;10^{-11} {\rm GeV}^{-1}$
produce an axion emission spectra with an averaged axion energy that varies
from 1 to 5 KeV, and an $L_{a}$ ranging from $10^{-6} $ to $7\;10^{-3}
\;L_\odot$. We also predict that $L_{a\gamma}$ varies from $5\;10^{-8}$ to
$10^{-5} \;L_\odot$ for stars with an averaged magnetic field of $3
\;10^{4}\;{\rm G}$ in their atmospheres. Most of these $L_{a\gamma}$
predictions are larger than the $L_X$ observed in some stars. Therefore, such
preliminary results show the potential of the next generation of stellar x-ray
missions to constrain several classes of axion models.

rollout policy. We use it for whittle index computation in case of model 2. We
obtain the concentration bound on value function in terms of horizon length and

perpendicularly or at an oblique angle with respect to the main direction of
the stretch. Due to stochastic effects, however, the distribution of angles
achieved by the cells is broader and, experimentally, histrograms over the

stationary state of probability density functions describing the statistical
distribution of the orientations of the cells using Fokker-Planck equations
derived from microscopic rules for the evolution of the orientation of the

related to a very general elastic energy and we will show that the results of
the time integration and of the stationary state of the related forward
Fokker-Planck equation compare very well with experimental results obtained by
different researchers. Then, in order to model more accurately the microscopic
process of cell re-orientation, we consider discrete in time random processes
that allow to recover Fokker- Planck equations through the well known technique
of quasi-invariant limit. In particular, we shall introduce a non-local rule
related to the evaluation of the state of stress experienced by the cell
extending its protrusions, and a model of re-orientation as a result of an
optimal control internally activated by the cell. Also in the latter case the
results match very well with experiments.

volume, surface area, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, and the
Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic as well as comparison of these morphometrics
between structures of different topology. The structures are commonly
represented implicitly in curve evolution problems as the zero level set of an

computation of curvatures, leading to considerable errors in morphometry. This
paper presents a fast, simple embedding procedure for accurate local
morphometry as the zero crossing of the Gaussian blurred binary image. The
proposed method was validated based on the femur and fourth lumbar vertebrae of
50 clinical computed tomography datasets. The results show that the signed
distance transform leads to large quantization errors in the computed local
curvature. Global validation of morphometry using regression and Bland-Altman
analysis revealed that the coefficient of determination for the average mean
curvature is improved from 93.8% with the signed distance transform to 100%
with the proposed method. For the surface area, the proportional bias is
improved from -5.0% for the signed distance transform to +0.6% for the proposed

signed distance transform to 98% accuracy for the proposed method. The proposed
method enables an improved local and global evaluation of curvature for

  intelligence",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The growing number of AI applications, also for high-stake decisions,
increases the interest in Explainable and Interpretable Machine Learning
(XI-ML). This trend can be seen both in the increasing number of regulations
and strategies for developing trustworthy AI and the growing number of
scientific papers dedicated to this topic. To ensure the sustainable
development of AI, it is essential to understand the dynamics of the impact of
regulation on research papers as well as the impact of scientific discourse on
AI-related policies. This paper introduces a novel framework for joint analysis
of AI-related policy documents and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
research papers. The collected documents are enriched with metadata and
interconnections, using various NLP methods combined with a methodology
inspired by Institutional Grammar. Based on the information extracted from
collected documents, we showcase a series of analyses that help understand
interactions, similarities, and differences between documents at different
stages of institutionalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to use automatic language analysis tools to understand the dynamics
between XI-ML methods and regulations. We believe that such a system
contributes to better cooperation between XAI researchers and AI policymakers.

  Mining (EDM21)",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a demonstration of REACT, a new Real-time Educational AI-powered
Classroom Tool that employs EDM techniques for supporting the decision-making
process of educators. REACT is a data-driven tool with a user-friendly
graphical interface. It analyzes students' performance data and provides
context-based alerts as well as recommendations to educators for course
planning. Furthermore, it incorporates model-agnostic explanations for bringing
explainability and interpretability in the process of decision making. This
paper demonstrates a use case scenario of our proposed tool using a real-world
dataset and presents the design of its architecture and user interface. This
demonstration focuses on the agglomerative clustering of students based on
their performance (i.e., incorrect responses and hints used) during an in-class
activity. This formation of clusters of students with similar strengths and
weaknesses may help educators to improve their course planning by identifying
at-risk students, forming study groups, or encouraging tutoring between
students of different strengths.

Woodland","Adapting GPT, GPT-2 and BERT Language Models for Speech Recognition","To appear in ASRU 2021",,,,"cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Language models (LMs) pre-trained on massive amounts of text, in particular
bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT), generative
pre-training (GPT), and GPT-2, have become a key technology for many natural
language processing tasks. In this paper, we present results using fine-tuned
GPT, GPT-2, and their combination for automatic speech recognition (ASR).
Unlike unidirectional LM GPT and GPT-2, BERT is bidirectional whose direct
product of the output probabilities is no longer a valid language prior
probability. A conversion method is proposed to compute the correct language
prior probability based on bidirectional LM outputs in a mathematically exact
way. Experimental results on the widely used AMI and Switchboard ASR tasks
showed that the combination of the fine-tuned GPT and GPT-2 outperformed the
combination of three neural LMs with different architectures trained from
scratch on the in-domain text by up to a 12% relative word error rate reduction
(WERR). Furthermore, on the AMI corpus, the proposed conversion for language
prior probabilities enables BERT to obtain an extra 3% relative WERR, and the
combination of BERT, GPT and GPT-2 results in further improvements.

  Search for the JVM","18 pages, 7 figures, Manuscript",,,,"cs.LG stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Flexible implementations of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), combined with
domain specific knowledge and hybridization with other search algorithms, can
be powerful for finding the solutions to problems in complex planning. We
introduce mctreesearch4j, an MCTS implementation written as a standard JVM
library following key design principles of object oriented programming. We
define key class abstractions allowing the MCTS library to flexibly adapt to
any well defined Markov Decision Process or turn-based adversarial game.
Furthermore, our library is designed to be modular and extensible, utilizing
class inheritance and generic typing to standardize custom algorithm
definitions. We demonstrate that the design of the MCTS implementation provides
ease of adaptation for unique heuristics and customization across varying
Markov Decision Process (MDP) domains. In addition, the implementation is
reasonably performant and accurate for standard MDP's. In addition, via the
implementation of mctreesearch4j, the nuances of different types of MCTS
algorithms are discussed.

Society of London his theory of the musclurity of the crystalline lens, as
being the cause of the accommodation of the eye to different distances. This
question had indeed been the topic of his very first communication to the Royal
Society seven years earlier; from which he had been forced to withdraw in the
meanwhile by a series of articles claiming either the priority on his
discovery, or the demonstration of it being erroneous. Seven years later, Young
turns back to the topic with a very strongly elaborated text indeniably proving
the role of the crystalline in accommodation, as well as offering a new and
convenient method for measuring the amplitude of accommodation, discovering the
default of astigmatism of the eye, and setting the most precise and complete
measurement of the living eye of its time. For these reasons, and for the tight
intellectual connections between this text and the Theory of Light and Colours
Thomas Young will publish a year later, we thought it important to bring a
translation and commentary of this text at the disposal of the French audience.

  Th\'eorie de la Lumi\`ere et des Couleurs de Thomas Young","En francais / In French",,,,"physics.hist-ph physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  On November 12, 1802, Thomas Young lays down in front of the Royal Society of
London his Theory of Light and Colours. In this text, he defends a vibratory
model or light, in which the peculiar attention he gives to the consequence of
the crossing of two light beams allows him to formulate the first version of
the interference principle. And to deduce out of it the first correct
justification of the colours of thin plates, from which he computes the very
first series of measurements of the wavelength of light ; a concept he
introduces for the very occasion. Based on this same principle, he presents the
first experience of diffraction from a grating, allowing him to anticipate the
reason of the origin of the colours of certain insects and butterflies.
Finally, the defense of this vibratory model is also the occasion for him to
elaborate the visionary hypothesis of the triple structure of the
photoreceptors of the retina involved in colour vision. The very high density
of concepts and innovative results embedded in this short text justifies by
itself the interest of bringing a translated and commented version of it at the
disposal of the French audience.
