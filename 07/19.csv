bounded hessian function over a strongly convex set can be reduced to convex
optimization. The first presented framework is a continuation of one of our
previous papers [11]. We improve the results and give an explicit algorithm for
the computation in polynomial time of the farthest point in a finite
intersection of n-disks to $C \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$ under the
requirement that $C$ does not belong to the convex hull of the centers of the
n-disks. Finally, in order to overcome this limitation we present a second
framework which characterizes the furthest in the finite intersection of
n-disks with $C$ in the convex hull. Unfortunately this second framework
requires the ability to decide if a polytope that we define is included in the
intersection, which is hard in general. However, as a particular application of
our second framework we are able solve in P time some instances of the subset
sum problem with real entries: given a set of real numbers decide if there is a
subset which adds up to zero.

to a very different evolution. When it is included, small < 50 au disks
represent about half the population. In addition, about ~ 70% of the stars have
no disk in this case which suggests that our resolution is still insufficient
to preserve the smaller disks. With ambipolar diffusion, the proportion of
small disks is also prominent and we report a flat mass distribution around
0.01-0.1 solar mass and a typical disk-to-star mass ratios of ~0.01-0.1. This

of the KLE. The numerical implementation of the proposed method is
straightforward. Through numerical experiments for a model of second-order

optimization problem for jointly designing the DL and UL quantization and
precoding strategies are then formulated, with the purpose of maximizing the
overall system weighted sum secrecy rate. Due to the intractability of the
formulated problem, an iterative solution is proposed, following the successive

Computation assignment algorithms are used to minimize the computation time

heterogeneous CSEC do not include stragglers-the slow machines during the
computation, we develop a new framework in heterogeneous CSEC that introduces
straggler tolerance. Based on this framework, we design a novel algorithm using
our previously proposed approach for heterogeneous CSEC such that the system
can handle any subset of stragglers of a specified size while minimizing the
computation time. Furthermore, we establish a trade-off in computation time and

lack of practical evaluations using real applications. In this paper, we

amyloid fibers, whose effects are still more significant on DNA dynamics. To
test this hypothesis, microrheology experiments on dispersions of DNA
associated with the amyloid terminal domain (CTR) of the bacterial protein Hfq
were performed using the technique of magnetic rotational spectroscopy (MRS).
In this chapter, we survey this microrheology technique which is based on the
remote actuation of magnetic wires embedded in a sample. MRS is interesting as
it is easy to implement, and does not require complex procedures regarding data
treatment. Pertaining to the interaction between DNA and amyloid fibers, it is
found that DNA and Hfq-CTR protein dispersion behave like a gel, an outcome
that suggests the formation of a network of amyloid fibers cross-linked with
the DNA strands. In contrast, the pristine DNA and Hfq-CTR dispersions behave
as purely viscous liquids. To broaden the scope of the MRS technique, we
include theoretical predictions for the rotation of magnetic wires regarding
the generic behaviors of basic rheological models from continuum mechanics, and
we list the complex fluids studied by this technique over the past 10 years.

of $\mathbf{P}$, the set of Grothendieck topologies on $\mathbf{E}$, and the
set of nuclei on the Heyting Algebra $\mathrm{Sub}(1_\mathbf{E})$. It also

The starting point is the recognition that probabilities are central to QM: the
formalism of QM is derived as a particular kind of flow on a finite dimensional
statistical manifold -- a simplex. The cotangent bundle associated to the
simplex has a natural symplectic structure and it inherits its own natural
metric structure from the information geometry of the underlying simplex. We
seek flows that preserve (in the sense of vanishing Lie derivatives) both the
symplectic structure (a Hamilton flow) and the metric structure (a Killing

linearity of the Schr\""odinger equation, the emergence of a complex numbers,
Hilbert spaces, and the Born rule, are derived rather than postulated.

between two identical and impermeable disks (inclusions) immersed in a bath of
identical, active (self-propelled), Brownian rods in two spatial dimensions, by
assuming that the self-propulsion axis of the rods may generally deviate from
their longitudinal axis. When the self-propulsion is transverse (perpendicular
to the rod axis), the accumulation of active rods around the inclusions is
significantly enhanced, causing a more expansive steric layering (ring
formation) of the rods around the inclusions, as compared with the reference
case of longitudinally self-propelling rods. As a result, the transversally
self-propelling rods also mediate a significantly longer ranged effective
interaction between the inclusions. The bath-mediated interaction arises due to
the overlaps between the active-rod rings formed around the inclusions, as they
are brought into small separations. When the self-propulsion axis is tilted
relative to the rod axis, we find an asymmetric imbalance of active-rod
accumulation around the inclusion dimer. This leads to a noncentral
interaction, featuring an anti-parallel pair of transverse force components
and, hence, a bath-mediated torque on the dimer.

are taken from the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) and the 2M++ catalogues,
limited to $K<11.5$. We find that both surveys are in good agreement, showing
an $\approx 21-22\%$ under-density at $z<0.075$ when compared to our
homogeneous counts model that assumes the same luminosity function and other
parameters as in our earlier papers. Using the Two Micron All Sky Survey
(2MASS) for $n(K)$ galaxy counts, we measure an under-density relative to this
model of $20\pm 2 \%$ at $K<11.5$, which is consistent in both form and scale
with the observed $n(z)$ under-density. To examine further the accuracy of the
counts model, we compare its prediction for the fainter $n(K)$ counts of the

model assuming the parameters of a previous study where little evidence for the
Local Hole was found. At $13<K<16$ we find a significantly better fit for our

implied under-density of $\approx 20\%$ means local measurements of the Hubble
Constant have been over-estimated by $\approx3$\%, such a scale of
under-density is in tension with a global $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at an
$\approx3\sigma$ level.

perfectly anti-correlated, to one where the optimal noise is correlated. More
generally, we then use numerical optimization methods to demonstrate that there

Integration family (such as the Adaptive Biasing Force method, ABF) are not

higher than one. Here the author introduces a flexible, portable implementation
of a Poisson equation formalism to integrate free energy surfaces from
estimated gradients in dimension 2 and 3, using any combination of periodic and
non-periodic (Neumann) boundary conditions. The algorithm is implemented in
portable C++, and provided as a standalone tool that can be used to integrate
multidimensional gradient fields estimated on a grid using any algorithm, such
as Umbrella Integration as a post-treatment of Umbrella Sampling simulations.
It is also included in the implementation of ABF (and its extended-system
variant eABF) in the Collective Variables Module, enabling the seamless
computation of multidimensional free energy surfaces within ABF and eABF
simulations. A Python-based analysis toolchain is provided to easily plot and
analyze multidimensional ABF simulation results, including metrics to assess
their convergence. The Poisson integration algorithm can also be used to
perform Helmholtz decomposition of noisy gradients estimates on the fly,
resulting in an efficient implementation of the projected ABF (pABF) method
proposed by Leli\`evre and co-workers. In numerical tests, pABF is found to
lead to faster convergence with respect to ABF in simple cases of low intrinsic
dimension, but seems detrimental to convergence in a more realistic case
involving degenerate coordinates and hidden barriers, due to slower
exploration. This suggests that variance reduction schemes do not always yield
convergence improvements when applied to enhanced sampling methods.

However, observations of nonthermal SNR emission imply CR energy distributions
that are generally steeper than $E^{-2}$, the standard DSA prediction. Recent
results from kinetic hybrid simulations suggest that such steep spectra may
arise from the drift of magnetic structures with respect to the thermal plasma
downstream of the shock. Using a semi-analytic model of non-linear DSA, we
investigate the implications that these results have on the phenomenology of a
wide range of SNRs. By accounting for the motion of magnetic structures in the
downstream, we produce CR energy distributions that are substantially steeper
than $E^{-2}$ and consistent with observations. Our formalism reproduces both
modestly steep spectra of Galactic supernova remnants ($\propto E^{-2.2}$) and
the very steep spectra of young radio supernovae ($\propto E^{-3}$).

non-degenerate. In other words, they are integrable critical points of the
energy functional. A full description of the kernel of the linearized operator
around each half-harmonic map is given. The second part of this paper devotes
to studying the quantitative stability of half-harmonic maps. When its degree
is $\pm 1$, we prove that the deviation of any map
$\boldsymbol{u}:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{S}$ from M\""obius transformations can be
controlled uniformly by $\|\boldsymbol{u}\|_{\dot H^{1/2}(\mathbb{R})}^2-deg
\boldsymbol{u}$. This result resembles the quantitative rigidity estimate of
degree $\pm 1$ harmonic maps $\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{S}^2$ which is proved
recently. Furthermore, we address the quantitative stability for half-harmonic
maps of higher degree. We prove that if $\boldsymbol{u}$ is already near to a
Blaschke product, then the deviation of $\boldsymbol{u}$ to Blaschke products
can be controlled by $\|\boldsymbol{u}\|_{\dot H^{1/2}(\mathbb{R})}^2-deg

quantitative estimate can not be true uniformly for all $\boldsymbol{u}$ of

slow rotation and find a probability of 4.8$\times$10$^{-3}$ that the observed

worsened. It is therefore recommended, especially for the vulnerable
population, to regularly monitor the blood oxygen level for precaution. Recent
works have investigated how ubiquitous smartphone cameras can be used to infer
SpO$_2$. Most of these works are contact-based, requiring users to cover a
phone's camera and its nearby light source with a finger to capture reemitted
light from the illuminated tissue. Contact-based methods may lead to skin
irritation and sanitary concerns, especially during a pandemic. In this paper,
we propose a noncontact method for SpO$_2$ monitoring using hand videos
acquired by smartphones. Considering the optical broadband nature of the red
(R), green (G), and blue (B) color channels of the smartphone cameras, we
exploit all three channels of RGB sensing to distill the SpO$_2$ information
beyond the traditional ratio-of-ratios (RoR) method that uses only two
wavelengths. To further facilitate an accurate SpO$_2$ prediction, we design
adaptive narrow bandpass filters based on accurately estimated heart rate to
obtain the most cardiac-related AC component for each color channel.
Experimental results show that our proposed blood oxygen estimation method can
reach a mean absolute error of 1.26% when a pulse oximeter is used as a
reference, outperforming the traditional RoR method by 25%.

achieves higher noise robustness without sacrificing performance on the task

dynamics -- an integrable dynamical system operating on the weights of the
network -- maintains a multiplicity of conserved quantities, most notably the
network's entire temporal map of input to output trajectories. The outcome of
our learning rule is a synaptic balancing between the incoming and outgoing
synapses of every neuron. This synaptic balancing rule is consistent with many
known aspects of experimentally observed heterosynaptic plasticity, and
moreover makes new experimentally testable predictions relating plasticity at
the incoming and outgoing synapses of individual neurons. Overall, this work
provides a novel, practical local learning rule that exactly preserves overall
network function and, in doing so, provides new conceptual bridges between the
disparate worlds of the neurobiology of heterosynaptic plasticity, the
engineering of regularized noise-robust networks, and the mathematics of
integrable Lax dynamical systems.

show that this lower bound is actually taken for several values of $p$ in the

not suffer from the same problem. Consequently, it has a much shorter

single node to boost system performance, with each GPU having a large capacity
of global memory and streaming multiprocessors (SMs). GPUs are an expensive
resource, and boosting utilization of GPUs without causing performance
degradation of individual workloads is an important and challenging problem.
Although services like MPS support simultaneous execution of multiple
co-operative kernels on a single device, they do not solve the above problem
for uncooperative kernels, MPS being oblivious to the resource needs of each
kernel.
  We propose a fully automated compiler-assisted scheduling framework. The
compiler constructs GPU tasks by identifying kernel launches and their related
GPU operations (e.g. memory allocations). For each GPU task, a probe is
instrumented in the host-side code right before its launch point. At runtime,
the probe conveys the information about the task's resource requirements (e.g.
memory and compute cores) to a scheduler, such that the scheduler can place the
task on an appropriate device based on the task's resource requirements and
devices' load in a memory-safe, resource-aware manner. To demonstrate its
advantages, we prototyped a throughput-oriented scheduler based on the
framework, and evaluated it with the Rodinia benchmark suite and the Darknet
neural network framework on NVIDIA GPUs. The results show that the proposed
solution outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions by leveraging its
knowledge about applications' multiple resource requirements, which include

to globally optimal joint plans with high probability. We show that the
proposed game can in general have arbitrarily poor Nash equilibria, which makes
the noisy best response algorithm preferable unless the task specifications are
known to have some special structure. We also describe a family of special
cases where all the equilibria are guaranteed to have bounded suboptimality.
Simulations and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the proposed
approach.

  Auto-Bisimulation of a Fuzzy Graph-Based Structure",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fuzzy graph-based structures such as fuzzy automata, fuzzy labeled transition
systems, fuzzy Kripke models, fuzzy social networks and fuzzy interpretations
in fuzzy description logics are useful in various applications. Given two
states, two actors or two individuals $x$ and $x'$ in such structures $G$ and
$G'$, respectively, the similarity degree between them can be defined to be
$Z(x,x')$, where $Z$ is the greatest fuzzy bisimulation between $G$ and $G'$
w.r.t. some t-norm-based fuzzy logic. Such a similarity measure has the
Hennessy-Milner property of fuzzy bisimulations as a strong logical foundation.
A fuzzy bisimulation between a fuzzy structure $G$ and itself is called a fuzzy
auto-bisimulation of $G$. The greatest fuzzy auto-bisimulation of an
image-finite fuzzy graph-based structure is a fuzzy equivalence relation. It is
useful for classification and clustering.
  In this paper, we design an efficient algorithm with the complexity
$O((m\log{l} + n)\log{n})$ for computing the fuzzy partition corresponding to
the greatest fuzzy auto-bisimulation of a finite fuzzy labeled graph $G$ under
the G\""odel semantics, where $n$, $m$ and $l$ are the number of vertices, the
number of non-zero edges and the number of different fuzzy degrees of edges of
$G$, respectively. Our notion of fuzzy partition is novel, defined only for
finite sets with respect to the G\""odel t-norm, with the aim to facilitate the
computation of the greatest fuzzy auto-bisimulation. By using that algorithm,
we also provide an algorithm with the complexity $O(m\cdot\log{l}\cdot\log{n} +
n^2)$ for computing the greatest fuzzy bisimulation between two finite fuzzy
labeled graphs under the G\""odel semantics. This latter algorithm is better
(has a lower complexity order) than the previously known algorithms for the
considered problem. Our algorithms can be restated for the other mentioned
fuzzy graph-based structures.

vision. Due to immense variability in scanners' parameters and imaging
protocols, even images obtained from the same person and the same scanner could
differ significantly. We address variability in computed tomography (CT) images
caused by different convolution kernels used in the reconstruction process, the
critical domain shift factor in CT. The choice of a convolution kernel affects
pixels' granularity, image smoothness, and noise level. We analyze a dataset of
paired CT images, where smooth and sharp images were reconstructed from the
same sinograms with different kernels, thus providing identical anatomy but
different style. Though identical predictions are desired, we show that the
consistency, measured as the average Dice between predictions on pairs, is just
0.54. We propose Filtered Back-Projection Augmentation (FBPAug), a simple and
surprisingly efficient approach to augment CT images in sinogram space
emulating reconstruction with different kernels. We apply the proposed method
in a zero-shot domain adaptation setup and show that the consistency boosts
from 0.54 to 0.92 outperforming other augmentation approaches. Neither specific
preparation of source domain data nor target domain data is required, so our
publicly released FBPAug can be used as a plug-and-play module for zero-shot

ultra-precise inertial sensor for future Earth geodesy missions. These sensors
are used to measure or compensate for all non-gravitational accelerations of
the host spacecraft so that they can be removed in the data analysis to recover
spacecraft motion due to Earth's gravity field, which is the main science
observable. Low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking missions like GRACE-FO that
utilize laser ranging interferometers are technologically limited by the
acceleration noise performance of their electrostatic accelerometers, in
addition to temporal aliasing associated with Earth's dynamic gravity field.
The S-GRS is estimated to be at least 40 times more sensitive than the GRACE
accelerometers and more than 500 times more sensitive if operated on a
drag-compensated platform. The improved performance is enabled by increasing
the mass of the sensor's test mass, increasing the gap between the test mass
and its electrode housing, removing the small grounding wire used in the GRACE
accelerometers and replacing them with a UV LED-based charge management system.
This level of improvement allows future missions to fully take advantage of the
sensitivity of the GRACE-FO laser Ranging Interferometer in the gravity
recovery analysis. The S-GRS concept is a simplified version of the
flight-proven LISA Pathfinder GRS. Our performance estimates are based on
models vetted during the LISA Pathfinder flight and the expected Earth orbiting
spacecraft environment based on flight data from GRACE-FO. The relatively low
volume, mass, and a power consumption enables use of the S-GRS on ESPA-class
microsatellites, reducing launch costs or enabling larger numbers of satellite
pairs to be utilized to improve the temporal resolution of Earth gravity field

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2102.04054",,,,"cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In multi-robot multi-target tracking, robots coordinate to monitor groups of
targets moving about an environment. We approach planning for such scenarios by
formulating a receding-horizon, multi-robot sensing problem with a mutual
information objective. Such problems are NP-Hard in general. Yet, our objective
is submodular which enables certain greedy planners to guarantee
constant-factor suboptimality. However, these greedy planners require robots to
plan their actions in sequence, one robot at a time, so planning time is at
least proportional to the number of robots. Solving these problems becomes
intractable for large teams, even for distributed implementations. Our prior
work proposed a distributed planner (RSP) which reduces this number of
sequential steps to a constant, even for large numbers of robots, by allowing
robots to plan in parallel while ignoring some of each others' decisions.
Although that analysis is not applicable to target tracking, we prove a similar
guarantee, that RSP planning approaches performance guarantees for fully
sequential planners, by employing a novel bound which takes advantage of the
independence of target motions to quantify effective redundancy between robots'
observations and actions. Further, we present analysis that explicitly accounts
for features of practical implementations including approximations to the
objective and anytime planning. Simulation results -- available via open source
release -- for target tracking with ranging sensors demonstrate that our
planners consistently approach the performance of sequential planning (in terms
of position uncertainty) given only 2--8 planning steps and for as many as 96
robots with a 24x reduction in the number of sequential steps in planning.
Thus, this work makes planning for multi-robot target tracking tractable at
much larger scales than before, for practical planners and general tracking
problems.

A variety of laboratory ice spectra simulating different chemical
environments, ice morphology as well as thermal and energetic processing are
demanded to provide an accurate interpretation of the infrared spectra of
protostars. To answer which combination of laboratory data best fit the
observations, an automated statistically-based computational approach becomes
necessary. Aims. To introduce a new approach, based on evolutionary algorithms,
to search for molecules in ice mantles via spectral decomposition of infrared
observational data with laboratory ice spectra. Methods. A publicly available
and open-source fitting tool, called ENIIGMA (dEcompositioN of Infrared Ice
features using Genetic Modelling Algorithms), is introduced. The tool has
dedicated Python functions to carry out continuum determination of the
protostellar spectra, silicate extraction, spectral decomposition and
statistical analysis to calculate confidence intervals and quantify degeneracy.
As an assessment of the code, several tests were conducted with known ice
samples and constructed mixtures. A complete analysis of the Elias 29 spectrum
was performed as well. Results. The ENIIGMA fitting tool can identify the
correct ice samples and their fractions in all checks with known samples tested
in this paper. Concerning the Elias 29 spectrum, the broad spectral range
between 2.5-20 $\mu$m was successfully decomposed after continuum determination
and silicate extraction. This analysis allowed the identification of different
molecules in the ice mantle, including a tentative detection of CH$_3$CH$_2$OH.
Conclusions. The ENIIGMA is a toolbox for spectroscopy analysis of infrared
spectra that is well-timed with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.
Additionally, it allows for exploring the different chemical environments and
irradiation fields in order to correctly interpret astronomical observations.

two sets $X,Y\subseteq E$ are \textit{cospanning} if $\sigma\left( X\right)
=\sigma\left( Y\right) $. Corresponding \textit{cospanning equivalence
relations} were investigated for greedoids in much detail (Korte, Lovasz,
Schrader; 1991). For instance, these relations determine greedoids uniquely. In
fact, the feasible sets of a greedoid are exactly the inclusion-wise minimal
sets of the equivalence classes. In this research, we show that feasible sets
of convex geometries are the inclusion-wise maximal sets of the equivalence
classes of the corresponding closure operator. Same as greedoids, convex
geometries are uniquely defined by the corresponding cospanning relations. For
each closure operator $\sigma$, an element $x\in X$ is \textit{an extreme
point} of $X$ if $x\notin\sigma(X-x)$. The set of extreme points of $X$ is
denoted by $ex(X)$. We prove, that if $\sigma$ has the anti-exchange property,
then for every set $X$ its equivalence class $[X]_{\sigma}$ is the interval
$[ex(X),\sigma(X)]$. It results in the one-to-one correspondence between the
cospanning partitions of an antimatroid and its complementary convex geometry.
The obtained results are based on the connection between violator spaces,
greedoids, and antimatroids. Cospanning characterization of these combinatorial
structures allows us not only to give the new characterization of antimatroids
and convex geometries but also to obtain the new properties of closure
operators, extreme point operators, and their interconnections.

(GAEs) to perform joint clustering and embedding learning. However, two
critical issues have been overlooked. First, the accumulative error, inflicted
by learning with noisy clustering assignments, degrades the effectiveness and
robustness of the clustering model. This problem is called Feature Randomness.
Second, reconstructing the adjacency matrix sets the model to learn irrelevant
similarities for the clustering task. This problem is called Feature Drift.
Interestingly, the theoretical relation between the aforementioned problems has
not yet been investigated. We study these issues from two aspects: (1) there is
a trade-off between Feature Randomness and Feature Drift when clustering and
reconstruction are performed at the same level, and (2) the problem of Feature
Drift is more pronounced for GAE models, compared with vanilla auto-encoder
models, due to the graph convolutional operation and the graph decoding design.
Motivated by these findings, we reformulate the GAE-based clustering
methodology. Our solution is two-fold. First, we propose a sampling operator
$\Xi$ that triggers a protection mechanism against the noisy clustering
assignments. Second, we propose an operator $\Upsilon$ that triggers a
correction mechanism against Feature Drift by gradually transforming the
reconstructed graph into a clustering-oriented one. As principal advantages,
our solution grants a considerable improvement in clustering effectiveness and
robustness and can be easily tailored to existing GAE models.

skin. Decreased tissue thickness, specifically in the stratum corneum (the
outermost layer of the tissue), causes discomfort and inflammation, and is
related to several severe diseases of the tissue. In order to maintain both
stratum corneum thickness and overall tissue thickness it is necessary for the
system to balance cell proliferation and cell loss. Cell proliferation in the
epidermis occurs in the basal layer and causes constant upwards movement in the
tissue. Cell loss occurs when dead cells at the top of the tissue are lost to
the environment through a process called desquamation. Desquamation is thought
to occur through a gradual reduction in adhesion between cells, due to the
cleaving of adhesion proteins by enzymes, in the stratum corneum.
  In this paper we will investigate combining a (mass action) subcellular model
of desquamation with a three dimensional (cell centre based) multicellular
model of the interfollicular epidermis to better understand maintenance of
epidermal thickness. These investigations show that hypothesised biological
models for the degradation of cell-cell adhesion from the literature are able
to provide a consistent rate of cell loss in the multicellular model. This loss
balances proliferation, and hence maintains a homeostatic tissue thickness.
Moreover, we find that multiple proliferative cell populations in the basal
layer can be represented by a single proliferative cell population, simplifying
investigations with this model.
  The model is used to investigate a disorder (Netherton Syndrome) which
disrupts desquamation. The model shows how biochemical changes can cause
disruptions to the tissue, resulting in a reduced tissue thickness and
consequently diminishing the protective role of the tissue. A hypothetical
treatment result is also investigated. [ABR]

extensive empirical evaluation that demonstrate the application of a non-binary

cleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate
the sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl

that human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than
one big batch of samples. This yields better over all model performance and
enables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been

reduces the amount of calculation and is easy to expand. Furthermore,
considering the differences in characteristics between semantic segmentation

distillation (CSD) module, which can help the compact segmentation network
strengthen the global category correlation by constructing the correlation
matrix. Combining these two modules, DSD framework has no extra parameters and

for ranking and revenue improvement. Industrial ensemble models are typically
deep neural networks, following the supervised learning paradigm to infer
conversion rate given inputs from sub-models. However, this process has the
following two problems. Firstly, the point-wise scoring approach disregards the
relationships between items and leads to homogeneous displayed results, while
diversified display benefits user experience and revenue. Secondly, the
learning paradigm focuses on the ranking metrics and does not directly optimize
the revenue. In our work, we propose a new Learning-To-Ensemble (LTE) framework
RAEGO, which replaces the ensemble model with a contextual Rank Aggregator (RA)
and explores the best weights of sub-models by the Evaluator-Generator
Optimization (EGO). To achieve the best online performance, we propose a new
rank aggregation algorithm TournamentGreedy as a refinement of classic rank
aggregators, which also produces the best average weighted Kendall Tau Distance
(KTD) amongst all the considered algorithms with quadratic time complexity.
Under the assumption that the best output list should be Pareto Optimal on the
KTD metric for sub-models, we show that our RA algorithm has higher efficiency
and coverage in exploring the optimal weights. Combined with the idea of
Bayesian Optimization and gradient descent, we solve the online contextual
Black-Box Optimization task that finds the optimal weights for sub-models given
a chosen RA model. RA-EGO has been deployed in our online system and has
improved the revenue significantly.

find that one unit-cell (u.c.) thick 1T-CrTe2 grown epitaxially on ZrTe2 is a
2D ferromagnet with a clear anomalous Hall effect. In thicker samples (12 u.c.

real-space Berry curvature. Finally, in ultrathin CrTe2 (3 u.c. thickness), we
demonstrate current-driven magnetization switching in a full vdW topological

nonlinearity. In this paper, an analytical model for MMF nonlinearity is
derived based on Enhanced Gaussian Noise (EGN) model formulation by considering
carrier phase estimation and the first four dispersion terms. The proposed EGN

a multi-node linear network, the joint optimized power and gain allocation

constraints including MM-EDFA saturation power and maximum gain are considered
and the problem is solved by using convex optimization. Three scenarios are
assumed including best equal power, optimized power, and joint optimized power

channels and modes with equal MM-EDFA gain in all spans. It is worth mentioning
that the MM-EDFA gain is equal to span loss. In the second scenario, different
powers are allocated to different channels and modes with equal MM-EDFA gain in
all spans. In the third case, allocated powers to each channel and mode are
optimized. Moreover, the MM-EDFA gain for each span is optimized separately.

provide on-chip photonic devices with unconventional features and performance.
However, such systems with realistic structures often miss the exact EPs even
in simulation, and the mechanism of this EP disruption has yet to be thoroughly
identified. Here, we extend the coupled-mode theory of one-dimensional
non-Hermitian resonator arrays to study the effects of the imaginary part of
the inter-cavity coupling, which is a second-order term and attributed to
material amplification, absorption, and radiation. By taking an appropriate
gauge for the model, we clarify that the imaginary coupling components have a
symmetric form in the effective Hamiltonian and hence represent
non-Hermiticity. These additional factors can lift the gain- and loss-based EP
degeneracies. However, they are proportional to the sum of the imaginary
permittivities for involved cavity pairs. Thus, when the amplification and
absorption of adjacent cavities are balanced, their contribution to the
imaginary coupling is canceled, and the EP singularity can be restored.
Radiation-induced imaginary couplings measure the change in net radiation loss
by the interference between cavity modes. Their impact on the EP can also be
counteracted by small cavity resonance detuning even in loss-biased cases. We
show and analyze eligible simulation examples based on photonic crystal
nanocavities, and highlight design of an ideal EP degeneracy that is protected
by generalized PT symmetry and induced by radiation.

in the space of unitary operators. Complexity geometry enables the application
of the methods of classical physics to deal with pure quantum problems. By
combining the two frameworks, i.e., the Jarzynski identity and complexity
geometry, we derived a complexity analog of the Jarzynski identity using the

version of the Jarzynski identity strengthened the evidence for the existence
of a well-defined resource theory of uncomplexity and presented an extensive

(BGK) equation is transformed from physical space to computational space. To
deal with the general mesh given by discretized points, the geometrical metrics
need to be constructed by the dimension-by-dimension Lagrangian interpolation.
The multidimensional weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction
is adopted in the computational domain for spatial accuracy, where the
reconstructed variables are the cell averaged Jacobian and the
Jacobian-weighted conservative variables. The two-stage fourth-order method,
which was developed for spatial-temporal coupled flow solvers, is used for
temporal discretization. The numerical examples for inviscid and laminar flows
validate the accuracy and geometrical conservation law of HGKS-cur. As a direct
application, HGKS-cur is implemented for the implicit large eddy simulation
(iLES) in compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows, including the compressible
turbulent channel flow and compressible turbulent flow over periodic hills. The
iLES results with HGKS-cur are in good agreement with the refereed spectral
methods and high-order finite volume methods. The performance of HGKS-cur
demonstrates its capability as a powerful tool for the numerical simulation of
compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows and massively separated flows.

output size $C(T)$ for an input string $T$ can increase when a single character
edit operation is performed on $T$. This notion enables one to measure the
robustness of compression algorithms in terms of errors and/or dynamic changes
occurring in the input string. In this paper, we analyze the worst-case
multiplicative sensitivity of string compression algorithms, which is defined
by $\max_{T \in \Sigma^n}\{C(T')/C(T) : ed(T, T') = 1\}$, where $ed(T, T')$
denotes the edit distance between $T$ and $T'$. For the most common versions of
the Lempel-Ziv 77 compressors, we prove that the worst-case multiplicative
sensitivity is upper bounded by a small constant, and give matching lower
bounds. We generalize these results to the smallest bidirectional scheme $b$.
In addition, we show that the sensitivity of a grammar-based compressor called
GCIS is also a small constant. Further, we extend the notion of the worst-case
sensitivity to string repetitiveness measures such as the smallest string
attractor size $\gamma$ and the substring complexity $\delta$, and show that
the worst-case sensitivity of $\delta$ is also a small constant. These results
contrast with the previously known related results such that the size $z_{\rm
78}$ of the Lempel-Ziv 78 factorization can increase by a factor of
$\Omega(n^{1/4})$ [Lagarde and Perifel, 2018], and the number $r$ of runs in
the Burrows-Wheeler transform can increase by a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$
[Giuliani et al., 2021] when a character is prepended to an input string of
length $n$. By applying our sensitivity bounds of $\delta$ or the smallest
grammar to known results (c.f. [Navarro, 2021]), some non-trivial upper bounds
for the sensitivities of important string compressors and repetitiveness
measures including $\gamma$, $r$, LZ-End, RePair, LongestMatch, and AVL-grammar

  Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) accepted",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Visual navigation has been widely used for state estimation of micro aerial
vehicles (MAVs). For stable visual navigation, MAVs should generate
perception-aware paths which guarantee enough visible landmarks. Many previous
works on perception-aware path planning focused on sampling-based planners.
However, they may suffer from sample inefficiency, which leads to computational
burden for finding a global optimal path. To address this issue, we suggest a
perception-aware path planner which utilizes topological information of
environments. Since the topological class of a path and visible landmarks
during traveling the path are closely related, the proposed algorithm checks
distinctive topological classes to choose the class with abundant visual
information. Topological graph is extracted from the generalized Voronoi
diagram of the environment and initial paths with different topological classes
are found. To evaluate the perception quality of the classes, we divide the
initial path into discrete segments where the points in each segment share
similar visual information. The optimal class with high perception quality is
selected, and a graph-based planner is utilized to generate path within the
class. With simulations and real-world experiments, we confirmed that the
proposed method could guarantee accurate visual navigation compared with the
perception-agnostic method while showing improved computational efficiency than
the sampling-based perception-aware planner.

  Multi-Objective Optimization",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increasingly complicated and diverse applications have distinct network
performance demands, e.g., some desire high throughput while others require low
latency. Traditional congestion controls (CC) have no perception of these
demands. Consequently, literatures have explored the objective-specific
algorithms, which are based on either offline training or online learning, to
adapt to certain application demands. However, once generated, such algorithms
are tailored to a specific performance objective function. Newly emerged
performance demands in a changeable network environment require either
expensive retraining (in the case of offline training), or manually redesigning
a new objective function (in the case of online learning). To address this
problem, we propose a novel architecture, DeepCC. It generates a CC agent that
is generically applicable to a wide range of application requirements and
network conditions. The key idea of DeepCC is to leverage both offline deep
reinforcement learning and online fine-tuning. In the offline phase, instead of
training towards a specific objective function, DeepCC trains its deep neural
network model using multi-objective optimization. With the trained model,
DeepCC offers near Pareto optimal policies w.r.t different user-specified
trade-offs between throughput, delay, and loss rate without any redesigning or
retraining. In addition, a quick online fine-tuning phase further helps DeepCC
achieve the application-specific demands under dynamic network conditions. The
simulation and real-world experiments show that DeepCC outperforms
state-of-the-art schemes in a wide range of settings. DeepCC gains a higher
target completion ratio of application requirements up to 67.4% than that of
other schemes, even in an untrained environment.

medical image segmentation. However, due to the locality of convolution
operations, they demonstrate limitations in learning global context and
long-range spatial relations. Recently, several researchers try to introduce
transformers to both the encoder and decoder components with promising results,
but the efficiency requires further improvement due to the high computational
complexity of transformers. In this paper, we propose LeViT-UNet, which
integrates a LeViT Transformer module into the U-Net architecture, for fast and
accurate medical image segmentation. Specifically, we use LeViT as the encoder
of the LeViT-UNet, which better trades off the accuracy and efficiency of the
Transformer block. Moreover, multi-scale feature maps from transformer blocks
and convolutional blocks of LeViT are passed into the decoder via
skip-connection, which can effectively reuse the spatial information of the

better performance comparing to various competing methods on several

transition is accompanied by a dramatic change in the characteristic stellar
mass, from $\sim 50\,\rm{M_\odot}$ at $Z \sim 10^{-6}\,\rm{Z_{\odot}}$ to $\sim
0.3\,\rm{M_\odot}$ once radiation feedback begins to dominate, which marks the
appearance of the modern bottom-heavy Milky Way IMF. In the high pressure
environments typical of massive elliptical galaxies, the characteristic mass
for the modern, dust-dominated regime falls to $\sim 0.1\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$, thus
providing an explanation for the more bottom-heavy IMF observed in these
galaxies. We conclude that metallicity is a key driver of variations in the
characteristic stellar mass, and by extension, the IMF.

large band dispersion along kz-direction near Fermi level, which is even wider

fluctuations are used to analyze the HR. The variation of Poincare parameters
(SD1),(SD2) and their ratio (SD12), with a lagged number, are non-linear and
reveal a significant change with meditation. In particular, the magnitude of
the slope and the curvature of(SD12) with lagged number increases after
meditation. The meditation reduces the heart rate and increases the stroke
volume. A strong correlation between slope and curvature of (SD12) is noted
from the correlation matrix of multi-dimensional data set resulting from the
Poincar\'e plot. The principal components (PC) of data resulting from pre-and
post-meditation are well separated in PC-space. The entropy associated with
R-wave fluctuations for all meditators is reduced after meditation. The
auto-correlation of HR fluctuations exhibits a highly correlated pattern after

increasing electrical conductivity and increasing optical transparency. To
improve both simultaneously is hindered by the physical limitation that good
metals with high electrical conductivity have large carrier densities that push
the plasma edge into the ultra-violet range. Transparent conductors are
compromises between electrical conductivity, requiring mobile electrons, and
optical transparency based on immobile charges to avoid screening of visible
light. Technological solutions reflect this trade-off, achieving the desired
transparencies by reducing the conductor thickness or carrier density at the
expense of a lower conductance. Here we demonstrate that highly anisotropic
crystalline conductors offer an alternative solution, avoiding this compromise
by separating the directions of conduction and transmission. Materials with a
quasi-two-dimensional electronic structure have a plasma edge well below the
range of visible light while maintaining excellent in-plane conductivity. We
demonstrate that slabs of the layered oxides Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and
Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ are optically transparent even at macroscopic
thicknesses >2$\mu$m for c-axis polarized light. Underlying this observation is
the fabrication of out-of-plane slabs by focused ion beam milling. This work
provides a glimpse into future technologies, such as highly polarized and
addressable optical screens, that advancements in a-axis thin film growth will
enable.

continuum suppression indeed exists in semiconducting single-wall carbon
nanotubes, a prototypical 1D semiconductor. However, absorption spectra for
carbon nanotubes are typically fit with a combination of Lorentzians and a
polynomial background baseline with little physical meaning. Here, we performed
absorption measurements in aligned single-chirality (6,5) carbon nanotube
films. The obtained spectra were fit with our theoretical model obtained by
solving the Boltzmann scattering equation (i.e., the quantum Fokker-Planck
equation), involving fifty-nine different types of transitions among three
different types of quasiparticles. Specifically, we took into account
microscopic interactions between photons, phonons, and excitons, including
their dispersions, which unambiguously demonstrated that the background
absorption is due to phonon-assisted transitions from the semiconductor vacuum
to finite-momentum continuum states of excitons. The excellent agreement we
obtained between experiment and theory suggests that our numerical technique
can be seamlessly extended to compute strongly out-of-equilibrium many-body
dynamics and time-resolved spectra in low-dimensional materials.

possible such that the entire revenue of the platform is maximized. We prove
that the MRVD problem is NP-hard and intractable. In addition, the dynamic
car-hailing platforms have no information of the future riders, which makes the
problem even harder. To handle the MRVD problem, we propose a queueing-based
vehicle dispatching framework, which first uses existing machine learning
algorithms to predict the future vehicle demand of each region, then estimates
the idle time periods of drivers through a queueing model for each region. With
the information of the predicted vehicle demands and estimated idle time
periods of drivers, we propose two batch-based vehicle dispatching algorithms
to efficiently assign suitable drivers to riders such that the expected overall
revenue of the platform is maximized during each batch processing. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our
proposed approaches over both real and synthetic datasets.

density profiles of both dark matter and baryonic gas in filaments of different

correction to the crystal structure, the phonon spectra, and the
superconducting critical temperatures, which have been estimated in previous
calculations without considering ionic fluctuations on the crystal structure
and assuming the harmonic approximation for the lattice dynamics. Quantum ionic
fluctuations have a large impact on the H2 molecular-like units present in the
crystal by increasing the hydrogen-hydrogen distance about a 5%. According to
our anharmonic phonon spectra, this structure will be dynamically stable at
least above 85 GPa, which is 45 GPa lower than the pressure given by the
harmonic approximation. Contrary to many superconducting hydrogen-rich
compounds, where quantum ionic effects and the consequent anharmonicity tend to
lower the superconducting critical temperature, our results show that it can be
enhanced in P63/mmc ScH6 by approximately a 15%. We attribute the enhancement
of the critical temperature to the stretching of the H$_2$ molecular-like units
and the associated increase of the electron-phonon interaction. Our results
suggest that quantum ionic effects increase the superconducting critical
temperature in hydrogen-rich materials with H2 units by increasing the

the FLRW deceleration parameter in the homogeneous and isotropic limit. The

Negation is a logical operator that is rarely present in type systems and

consequence, many software tools, but also formal frameworks for working with
JSON Schema, do not fully support negation. As of today, the question whether
covering negation is practically relevant, or a mainly theoretical exercise
(albeit challenging), is open. This motivates us to study whether negation is
really used in practice, for which aims, and whether it could be - in principle
- replaced by simpler operators. We have collected the most diverse corpus of
JSON Schema documents analyzed so far, based on a crawl of 90k open source
schemas hosted on GitHub. We perform a systematic analysis, quantify usage
patterns of negation, and also qualitatively analyze schemas. We show that
negation is indeed used, following a stable set of patterns, with the potential
to mature into design patterns.

for generating synthesized data similar to real data by jointly training a

resources are distributed over many devices, so centralized computation with
all data in one location is infeasible due to privacy and/or communication
constraints. This paper proposes a new framework for training GANs in a
distributed fashion: Each device computes a local discriminator using local
data; a single server aggregates their results and computes a global GAN.
Specifically, in each iteration, the server sends the global GAN to the
devices, which then update their local discriminators; the devices send their
results to the server, which then computes their average as the global
discriminator and updates the global generator accordingly. Two different
update schedules are designed with different levels of parallelism between the
devices and the server. Numerical results obtained using three popular datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework can outperform a state-of-the-art
framework in terms of convergence speed.

for supervised learning, current theoretical understandings of ERM and SGD
either have stronger assumptions in convex learning, e.g., strong convexity, or

methods that remove watermarks by altering DNN parameters. In this paper, we
bypass such attacks by introducing a structural watermarking scheme that
utilizes channel pruning to embed the watermark into the host DNN architecture
instead of crafting the DNN parameters. To be specific, during watermark
embedding, we prune the internal channels of the host DNN with the channel
pruning rates controlled by the watermark. During watermark extraction, the
watermark is retrieved by identifying the channel pruning rates from the
architecture of the target DNN model. Due to the superiority of pruning
mechanism, the performance of the DNN model on its original task is reserved

work enables the embedded watermark to be reliably recovered and provides a
sufficient payload, without sacrificing the usability of the DNN model. It is
also demonstrated that the proposed work is robust against common transforms

capable of creating the cavity. We identified 79 co-moving stars of IL Cep at 2
pc radius from the analysis of {\textit Gaia} EDR3 astrometry. The transverse
velocity analysis of the co-moving stars shows that they belong to two
different populations associated with IL Cep and HD 216658, respectively.
Further analysis confirms that all the stars in the IL Cep population are
mostly coeval ($\sim$ 0.1 Myr). Infrared photometry revealed that there are 26
Class II objects among the co-moving stars. The stars without circumstellar
disk (Class III) are 65\% of all the co-moving stars. There are 9 intense
H$\alpha$ emission candidates identified among the co-moving stars using IPHAS
H$\alpha$ narrow-band photometry. The dendrogram analysis on the Hydrogen
column density map identified 11 molecular clump structures on the expanding
cavity around IL Cep, making it an active star-forming region. The formation of
the IL Cep stellar group due to the ""rocket effect"" by HD 216658 is discussed.

detect weak gravitational lensing from low-density regions. In this work, we
investigate tomographic cross-correlation between Planck CMB lensing maps and
LDP-traced LSSs, where LDPs are constructed from the DR8 data release of the
DESI legacy imaging survey, with about $10^6$-$10^7$ galaxies. We find that,
due to the large sky coverage (20,000 deg$^2$) and large redshift depth ($z\leq
1.2$), a significant detection ($10\sigma$--$30\sigma$) of the CMB lensing-LDP
cross-correlation in all six redshift bins can be achieved, with a total
significance of $\sim 53\sigma$ over $ \ell\le1024$. Moreover, the measurements
are in good agreement with a theoretical template constructed from our
numerical simulation in the WMAP 9-year $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. A scaling
factor for the lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ is constrained to $A_{\rm
lens}=1\pm0.12$ for $z<0.2$, $A_{\rm lens}=1.07\pm0.07$ for $0.2<z<0.4$ and
$A_{\rm lens}=1.07\pm0.05$ for $0.4<z<0.6$, with the r-band absolute magnitude
cut of $-21.5$ for LDP selection. A variety of tests have been performed to
check the detection reliability, against variations in LDP samples and galaxy
magnitude cuts, masks, CMB lensing maps, multipole $\ell$ cuts, sky regions,
and photo-z bias. We also perform a cross-correlation measurement between CMB
lensing and galaxy number density, which is consistent with the CMB lensing-LDP
cross-correlation. This work therefore further convincingly demonstrates that
LDP is a competitive tracer of LSS.

deceptive multiplexer-based logic-locking scheme that is resilient against
structure-exploiting machine learning attacks. Through the design of D-MUX, we
uncover a major fallacy in existing multiplexer-based locking schemes in the

D-MUX is presented. To the best of our knowledge, D-MUX is the first
machine-learning-resilient locking scheme capable of protecting against all
known learning-based attacks. Hereby, the presented work offers a starting

future states of a running business~process. However, the internal mechanisms
of many existing predictive algorithms are opaque and a human decision-maker is
unable to understand \emph{why} a certain activity was predicted. Recently,
counterfactuals have been proposed in the literature to derive
human-understandable explanations from predictive models. Current
counterfactual approaches consist of finding the minimum feature change that
can make a certain prediction flip its outcome. Although many algorithms have
been proposed, their application to multi-dimensional sequence data like event
logs has not been explored in the literature.
  In this paper, we explore the use of a recent, popular model-agnostic
counterfactual algorithm, DiCE, in the context of predictive process analytics.
The analysis reveals that DiCE is unable to derive explanations for process
predictions, due to (1) process domain knowledge not being taken into account,
(2) long traces of process execution that often tend to be less understandable,
and (3) difficulties in optimising the counterfactual search with categorical
variables. We design an extension of DiCE, namely DiCE4EL (DiCE for Event
Logs), that can generate counterfactual explanations for process prediction,
and propose an approach that supports deriving milestone-aware counterfactual
explanations at key intermediate stages along process execution to promote
interpretability. We apply our approach to a publicly available real-life event
log and the analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

essential next-generation communications technique. However, due to the
constraints of size, cost, and power consumption, it is usually considered
unrealistic to use a large-scale antenna array at the user side. Inspired by
the emerging technique of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), we firstly
propose the concept of user-side RIS (US-RIS) for facilitating the employment
of a large-scale antenna array at the user side in a cost- and energy-efficient
way. In contrast to the existing employments of RIS, which belong to the family
of base-station-side RISs (BSS-RISs), the US-RIS concept by definition
facilitates the employment of RIS at the user side for the first time. This is
achieved by conceiving a multi-layer structure to realize a compact
form-factor. Furthermore, our theoretical results demonstrate that, in contrast
to the existing single-layer structure, where only the phase of the signal
reflected from RIS can be adjusted, the amplitude of the signal penetrating
multi-layer US-RIS can also be partially controlled, which brings about a new
degree of freedom (DoF) for beamformer design that can be beneficially
exploited for performance enhancement. In addition, based on the proposed
multi-layer US-RIS, we formulate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization
problem of US-RIS-aided communications. Due to the non-convexity of the problem
introduced by this multi-layer structure, we propose a multi-layer transmit
beamformer design relying on an iterative algorithm for finding the optimal
solution by alternately updating each variable. Finally, our simulation results
verify the superiority of the proposed multi-layer US-RIS as a compact

HLIRGs in three deep fields (Bo$\""o$tes, Lockman-Hole, ELAIS-N1) and adopt two
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, CIGALE, which assumes energy
balance, and CYGNUS, which is based on radiative transfer models and does not
adopt energy balance principle. We use two different active galactic nucleus
(AGN) models in CIGALE and three AGN models in CYGNUS to compare the results
estimated using different SED fitting codes and different AGN models. The
stellar mass, total IR luminosity and AGN luminosity agree well between
different models with a typical median offset of 0.1 dex. The SFR estimates
show the largest dispersions (up to 0.5 dex). This dispersion has an impact on
the subsequent analysis, which may suggest that previous contradictory results
could partly be due to different choices of methods. HLIRGs are ultra-massive
galaxies with 99% of them having stellar masses larger than $10^{11}
M_{\odot}$. Our results reveal a higher space density of ultra-massive galaxies
than found in previous surveys or predicted by simulations. We find that HLIRGs
contribute more to the cosmic SFR density as redshift increases. In terms of BH
growth, the two SED fitting methods provide different results. We can see a
clear trend in which SFR decreases as AGN luminosity increases when using
CYGNUS estimates, possibly implying quenching by AGN, while this trend is much
weaker when using CIGALE estimates. This difference is also influenced by the
dispersion between SlFR estimates obtained by the two codes.

for smart radio environment in which passive antenna arrays can be used to
actively tailor/control the radio propagation. With multiple IRSs being
launched to support various group of users, it is critical to jointly optimize
the phase-shifts of all IRSs to mitigate the interference as well as to
leverage the secondary reflections amongst IRSs. This work considers the uplink
of multiple users that are grouped and supported by multiple IRSs to a
multi-antenna base station. Each IRS with multiple controllable phase-shift
elements is intended to serve a group of near-by users. We first formulate the
minimum achievable rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing phase-shifts
of elements from all IRSs and the received beamformers at the MIMO base
station. The problem turns out to be non-convex. We then derive its solution
using the alternating optimization mechanism. Our simulations show that by
properly managing interference and leveraging the secondary reflections amongst
IRSs, there is a great benefit of deploying more IRSs to support different
groups of users to achieve a higher rate per user. In contrast, without
properly managing the secondary reflections, increasing the number of IRSs can
adversely impact the network throughput, especially for higher transmit power.

Despite its success, there are some main problems when deploying advanced DL

cardinality estimation for SQL queries with a focus on uncertainty, which we
believe is important in database systems when dealing with a large number of
user queries on various applications. With uncertainty ensured, instead of
trusting an estimator learned as it is, a query optimizer can explore other
options when the estimator learned has a large variance, and it also becomes
possible to update the estimator to improve its prediction in areas with high
uncertainty. The approach we explore is different from the direction of
deploying sophisticated DL models in database systems to build cardinality
estimators. We employ Bayesian deep learning (BDL), which serves as a bridge
between Bayesian inference and deep learning.The prediction distribution by BDL
provides principled uncertainty calibration for the prediction. In addition,
when the network width of a BDL model goes to infinity, the model performs
equivalent to Gaussian Process (GP). This special class of BDL, known as Neural
Network Gaussian Process (NNGP), inherits the advantages of Bayesian approach
while keeping universal approximation of neural network, and can utilize a much
larger model space to model distribution-free data as a nonparametric model. We
show that our uncertainty-aware NNGP estimator achieves high accuracy, can be
built very fast, and is robust to query workload shift, in our extensive

especially for inference. However, neither CPU nor GPU can meet these needs if
considering both performance and energy efficiency. That's because accelerating
GNNs is challenging due to their excessive memory usage and arbitrary
interleaving of diverse operations. Besides, the semantics gap between the
high-level GNN programming model and efficient hardware makes it difficult in
accelerating general-domain GNNs.
  To address the challenge, we propose Zipper, an efficient yet general

which should be scalable down to nanometer range for utilization in nanoscale
digital superconducting technology. Such junctions should possess high values
of critical current, $I_c$, and normal state resistance, $R_n$. Another
requirement is the high reproducibility of the junction parameters across a
wafer in a fabrication process. We argue that Superconductor - Normal metal -
Superconductor (SN-N-NS) Josephson junction of ""variable thickness bridge""
geometry is a promising choice to meet these requirements. Theoretical analysis
of SN-N-NS junction is performed in the case where the distance between the
S-electrodes is comparable to the coherence length of the N-material. The
restriction on the junction geometrical parameters providing the existence of
superconductivity in the S-electrodes is derived for the current flowing
through the junction of an order of $I_c$. The junction heating, as well as
available mechanisms for the heat removal, is analyzed. The obtained results
show that an SN-N-NS junction with a high (sub-millivolt) value of $I_cR_n$
product can be fabricated from a broadly utilized combination of materials like
Nb/Cu using well-established technological processes. The junction area can be
scaled down to that of semiconductor transistors fabricated in the frame of a
40-nm process.

pixel-wise similarity learning to set-wise one to improve the robustness
because sets contain more semantic and structure information. Specifically, by
resorting to attentional features of views, we establish corresponding sets,
thus filtering out noisy backgrounds that may cause incorrect correspondences.
Meanwhile, these attentional features can keep the coherence of the same image
across different views to alleviate semantic inconsistency. We further search
the cross-view nearest neighbours of sets and employ the structured
neighbourhood information to enhance the robustness. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that SetSim is superior to state-of-the-art methods on object

and aims to measure the strength of the causal relationship, is of great
importance in many fields but is a challenging problem in practice. As present,
data-driven causal effect estimation faces two main challenges, i.e., selection
bias and the missing of counterfactual. To address these two issues, most of
the existing approaches tend to reduce the selection bias by learning a
balanced representation, and then to estimate the counterfactual through the
representation. However, they heavily rely on the finely hand-crafted metric
functions when learning balanced representations, which generally doesn't work
well for the situations where the original distribution is complicated. In this
paper, we propose a CETransformer model for casual effect estimation via
transformer based representation learning. To learn the representation of
covariates(features) robustly, a self-supervised transformer is proposed, by
which the correlation between covariates can be well exploited through
self-attention mechanism. In addition, an adversarial network is adopted to
balance the distribution of the treated and control groups in the
representation space. Experimental results on three real-world datasets
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed CETransformer, compared with the
state-of-the-art treatment effect estimation methods.

NERO reduces the energy consumption by 12x and 35x for the same two kernels

become available to the final user, hence potentially allowing to show the
quantum speedups predicted by the quantum information theory. However, before
implementing any quantum algorithm, it is crucial to have at least a partial or
possibly full knowledge on the type and amount of noise affecting the quantum
machine. Here, by generalizing quantum generative adversarial learning from
quantum states (Q-GANs) to quantum operations/superoperators/channels (here
named as SuperQGANs), we propose a very promising framework to characterize
noise in a realistic quantum device, even in the case of spatially and
temporally correlated noise (memory channels) affecting quantum circuits. The
key idea is to learn about the noise by mimicking it in a way that one cannot
distinguish between the real (to be sensed) and the fake (generated) one. We
find that, when applied to the benchmarking case of Pauli channels, the
SuperQGAN protocol is able to learn the associated error rates even in the case
of spatially and temporally correlated noise. Moreover, we also show how to
employ it for quantum metrology applications. We believe our SuperQGANs pave
the way for new hybrid quantum-classical machine learning protocols for a
better characterization and control of the current and future unavoidably noisy

Fluctuations (SBF) for studying composite stellar populations (CSP). To do so,
we have computed the standard (mean) and SBF spectra with E-MILES stellar
population synthesis code. We have created a set of models composed by
different mass fractions of two single stellar populations (SSP), as a first
approximation of a CSP scenario. With these models we present an ensemble of
SBF colour-colour diagnostic diagrams that reveal different secondary
populations depending on the bands used. For this work we focus on those
colours capable of unveiling small fractions of metal-poor components in
elliptical galaxies, which are dominated by old metal-rich stellar populations.
We fit a set of synthetic models and a selection of nearby elliptical galaxies
to our CSP models using both mean and SBF colours. We find that the results are
highly improved and return small secondary components when mean and SBF values
are applied simultaneously, instead of employing them separately or as a
constraint. Finally, we explore the possibility of tracking chemical enrichment
histories by including in the analysis a variety of SBF colours. For this
purpose we present an example where, with two different SBF colour-colour
diagrams, we untangle a small contribution of a young solar population and an
old metal-poor component from an old solar principal population. The results we
have found are promising, but limited by the available data. We highlight the
urgent need for new, better and more consistent SBF observations.

of rational sizes in [0,1] are to be packed into bins, such that no bin has
more than k items or total size larger than 1. The goal is to minimize the
number of bins.
  A recently introduced concept, called the price of clustering, deals with
inputs that are presented in a way that they are split into clusters. Thus, an
item has two attributes which are its size and its cluster. The goal is to
measure the relation between an optimal solution that cannot combine items of
different clusters into bins, and an optimal solution that can combine items of
different clusters arbitrarily. Usually the number of clusters may be large,
while clusters are relatively small, though not trivially small. Such problems
are related to greedy bin packing algorithms, and to batched bin packing, which
is similar to the price of clustering, but there is a constant number of large
clusters. We analyze the price of clustering for BPCC, including the parametric
case with bounded item sizes. We discuss several greedy algorithms for this

usefulness in optoelectronic applications. However, available theoretical
descriptions of the thermoelectric effect in terms of the Seebeck coefficient
do not take into account the role of the photoexcited electron density. In this
work, we adopt the concept of effective Seebeck coefficient [G.D. Mahan, J.
Appl. Phys. 87, 7326 (2000)] and extend it to the case of a photoexcited
two-dimensional (2D) electron gas. We calculate the effective Seebeck
coefficient for photoexcited graphene, we compare it to the commonly used
""phenomenological"" Seebeck coefficient, and we show how it depends on the
photoexcited electron density and temperature. Our results are necessary inputs
for any quantitative microscopic theory of thermoelectric effects in graphene
and related 2D materials.

football season as a dense network with nodes identified by teams and
categorical edges representing the outcome of each game as a win, draw or a
loss. The main focus and motivation for this paper is to provide a statistical
framework to assess the issue of competitive balance in the context of the
English First Division / Premier League over more than 40 seasons. The Premier
League is arguably one of the most popular leagues in the world, in terms of
its global reach and the revenue which it generates. Therefore it is of wide
interest to assess its competitiveness. Our analysis provides evidence
suggesting a structural change around the early 2000's from a reasonably
balanced league to a two-tier league.

for a sample of 1346 bright stars, has been recently published, its usefulness
is still limited due to the small number of reference stars available,
considering that they are distributed throughout the whole celestial sphere,
and the fact that they are restricted to Johnson V < 6.6 mag. This work
presents synthetic RGB magnitudes for ~15 million stars brighter than Gaia G =
18 mag, making use of a calibration between the RGB magnitudes of the reference
bright star sample and the corresponding high quality photometric G, G_BP and
G_RP magnitudes provided by the Gaia EDR3. The calibration has been restricted
to stars exhibiting -0.5 < G_BP - G_RP < 2.0 mag, and aims to predict RGB
magnitudes within an error interval of $\pm 0.1$ mag. Since the reference
bright star sample is dominated by nearby stars with slightly undersolar
metallicity, systematic variations in the predictions are expected, as modelled
with the help of stellar atmosphere models. These deviations are constrained to
the $\pm 0.1$ mag interval when applying the calibration only to stars scarcely
affected by interstellar extinction and with metallicity compatible with the
median value for the bright star sample. The large number of Gaia sources
available in each region of the sky should guarantee high-quality RGB
photometric calibrations.

Here, we study the spin dynamics of the tetrahedral cluster antiferromagnet,
pharmacosiderite, via muon spin resonance and neutron scattering. We find that
the spin correlation exhibits a two-dimensional characteristic despite the
isotropic connectivity of tetrahedral clusters made of spin 5/2 Fe3+ ions in
the three-dimensional cubic crystal, which we ascribe to two-dimensionalisation
by geometrical frustration based on spin wave calculations. Moreover, we
suggest that even one-dimensionalisation occurs in the decoupled layers,
generating low-energy and one-dimensional excitation modes, causing large spin
fluctuation in the classical spin system. Pharmacosiderite facilitates studying
the emergence of low-dimensionality and manipulating anisotropic responses
arising from the dimensionality using an external magnetic field.

Here, we examine the speckle decorrelation in the fundamental and

following topological phases that are no counterpart of the $s$-wave case:
crystalline symmetry-protected helical Majorana edge modes, a line node phase

  2021",,,,"cs.AI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Epistemic Planning (EP) refers to an automated planning setting where the
agent reasons in the space of knowledge states and tries to find a plan to
reach a desirable state from the current state. Its general form, the
Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) problem involves multiple agents who need
to reason about both the state of the world and the information flow between
agents. In a MEP problem, multiple approaches have been developed recently with
varying restrictions, such as considering only the concept of knowledge while
not allowing the idea of belief, or not allowing for ``complex"" modal operators
such as those needed to handle dynamic common knowledge. While the diversity of
approaches has led to a deeper understanding of the problem space, the lack of
a standardized way to specify MEP problems independently of solution approaches
has created difficulties in comparing performance of planners, identifying
promising techniques, exploring new strategies like ensemble methods, and
making it easy for new researchers to contribute to this research area. To
address the situation, we propose a unified way of specifying EP problems - the
Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language, E-PDDL. We show that E-PPDL can
be supported by leading MEP planners and provide corresponding parser code that
translates EP problems specified in E-PDDL into (M)EP problems that can be
handled by several planners. This work is also useful in building more general
epistemic planning environments where we envision a meta-cognitive module that
takes a planning problem in E-PDDL, identifies and assesses some of its
features, and autonomously decides which planner is the best one to solve it.

solved by GRW algorithms using either biased or unbiased random walk

restrictions on data availability. To still obtain viable models, continual
learning aims to train in sequential order, as and when data is available. The
main challenge that continual learning methods face is to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, i.e., a decrease in performance on the data encountered earlier.
This issue makes continuous training of segmentation models for medical
applications extremely difficult. Yet, often, data from at least two different
domains is available which we can exploit to train the model in a way that it
disregards domain-specific information. We propose an architecture that
leverages the simultaneous availability of two or more datasets to learn a
disentanglement between the content and domain in an adversarial fashion. The
domain-invariant content representation then lays the base for continual
semantic segmentation. Our approach takes inspiration from domain adaptation
and combines it with continual learning for hippocampal segmentation in brain
MRI. We showcase that our method reduces catastrophic forgetting and
outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods.

modelling results. Here we present the first set of black hole - neutron star
simulations that were obtained with the numerical-relativity code BAM. Our
initial data are constructed using the public LORENE spectral library which
employs an excision of the black hole interior. BAM, in contrast, uses the
moving-puncture gauge for the evolution. Therefore, we need to ``stuff'' the
black hole interior with smooth initial data to evolve the binary system in
time. This procedure introduces constraint violations such that the constraint
damping properties of the evolution system are essential to increase the
accuracy of the simulation and in particular to reduce spurious center-of-mass
drifts. Within BAM we evolve the Z4c equations and we compare our
gravitational-wave results with those of the SXS collaboration and results
obtained with the SACRA code. While we find generally good agreement with the
reference solutions and phase differences $\lesssim 0.5$ rad at the moment of
merger, the absence of a clean convergence order in our simulations does not
allow for a proper error quantification. We finally present a set of different

equations, which describe the expected outcome of an experiment (i.e., the
average over many realizations of the same dynamics). Quantum trajectories,
instead, model the outcome of ideal single experiments -- the ``clicks'' of a
perfect detector due to, e.g., spontaneous emission. The correct description of
quantum jumps, which are related to random events characterizing a sudden
change in the wave function of an open quantum system, is pivotal to the
definition of quantum trajectories. In this article, we extend the formalism of
quantum trajectories to open quantum systems with ultrastrong coupling (USC)
between light and matter by properly defining jump operators in this regime. In
such systems, exotic higher-order quantum-state- and energy-transfer can take
place without conserving the total number of excitations in the system. The
emitted field of such USC systems bears signatures of these higher-order
processes, and significantly differs from similar processes at lower coupling
strengths. Notably, the emission statistics must be taken at a single quantum
trajectory level, since the signatures of these processes are washed out by the
``averaging'' of a master equation. We analyze the impact of the chosen
unravelling (i.e., how one collects the output field of the system) for the
quantum trajectories and show that these effects of the higher-order USC
processes can be revealed in experiments by constructing histograms of detected
quantum jumps. We illustrate these ideas by analyzing the excitation of two
atoms by a single photon~[Garziano et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.117, 043601 (2016)].
For example, quantum trajectories reveal that keeping track of the quantum
jumps from the atoms allow to reconstruct both the oscillations between one
photon and two atoms, as well as emerging Rabi oscillations between the two
atoms.

transferring knowledge from self-supervised tasks to downstream tasks could

self-supervised tasks and downstream tasks in terms of optimization objective
and training data. Conventional pre-training methods may be not effective
enough on knowledge transfer since they do not make any adaptation for
downstream tasks. To solve such problems, we propose a new transfer learning
paradigm on GNNs which could effectively leverage self-supervised tasks as

and combine different auxiliary tasks with the target task in the fine-tuning
stage. We design an adaptive auxiliary loss weighting model to learn the

vision, which brings new challenges such as small object inference, background
clutter and wide viewpoint. However, there are few algorithms focusing on crowd

To this end, we collect a large-scale dataset and organize the Vision Meets
Drone Crowd Counting Challenge (VisDrone-CC2020) in conjunction with the 16th
European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2020) to promote the developments
in the related fields. The collected dataset is formed by $3,360$ images,
including $2,460$ images for training, and $900$ images for testing.
Specifically, we manually annotate persons with points in each video frame.
There are $14$ algorithms from $15$ institutes submitted to the VisDrone-CC2020

By utilizing the characteristics of objectness that DNNs have learned, fully
decomposing the network prediction visualizes clear localization of target

with publicly accessible datasets. As an intuitive assessment metric for
explanations, we report the performance of intersection of Union between visual
explanation and bounding box of lesions. Experiment results show that recently
proposed attribution methods visualize the more accurate localization for the
diagnostic decision compared to the traditionally used CAM. Furthermore, we
analyze the inconsistency of intentions between humans and DNNs, which is
easily obscured by high performance. By visualizing the relevant factors, it is
possible to confirm that the criterion for decision is in line with the

aerial images captured in different environments. Estimating the precise
transformation parameters is hindered by various environments such as time,
weather, and viewpoints. The characteristics of the aerial images are mainly
composed of a straight line owing to building and road. Therefore, the straight
lines are distorted when estimating homography parameters directly between two
images. In this paper, we propose a deep homography alignment network to
precisely match two aerial images by progressively estimating the various
transformation parameters. The proposed network is possible to train the
matching network with a higher degree of freedom by progressively analyzing the
transformation parameters. The precision matching performances have been
increased by applying homography transformation. In addition, we introduce a
method that can effectively learn the difficult-to-learn homography estimation
network. Since there is no published learning data for aerial image
registration, in this paper, a pair of images to which random homography
transformation is applied within a certain range is used for learning. Hence,
we could confirm that the deep homography alignment network shows high
precision matching performance compared with conventional works.

concerning uncertainties. This concept of uncertainty can provide a confidence
level for each feature which prevents overconfident predictions with poor

that jointly considers dermatological classification and uncertainty estimation

effective. The renormalization couplings of the charmonium states have been
strictly fixed by the compositeness conditions that excludes the constituent
degrees of freedom from the space of physical states. We use the basic model
parameters for the constituent c-quark mass $m_c=1.80$ GeV and the global
infrared cutoff $\lambda=0.181$ GeV. We additionally introduce only one
adjustable parameter $\varrho>0$ common for the charmonium states
$\eta_c({}^1\!S_0)$, $J/\psi({}^3\!S_1)$, $\chi_{c0}({^{3}}\!P_{0})$,
$\chi_{c1}({^{3}}\!P_{1})$, $h_c({^{1}}\!P_{1})$, and
$\chi_{c2}({^{3}}\!P_{2})$ to describe the quark distribution inside the

steps and turns. To do so well, robots need not have primitives that make
intuitive sense to humans. This becomes of paramount importance when robots are
damaged and no longer move as designed. Here we propose a goal function we call
""coverage"", that represents the usefulness of a library of locomotion
primitives in a manner agnostic to the particulars of the primitives
themselves. We demonstrate the ability to optimize coverage on both simulated

injury. This suggests that by optimizing for coverage, robots can sustain their
ability to navigate through the world even in the face of significant
mechanical failures. The benefits of this approach are enhanced by
sample-efficient, data-driven approaches to system identification that can
rapidly inform the optimization of primitives. We found that the number of
degrees of freedom improved the rate of recovery of our simulated robots, a
rare result in the fields of gait optimization and reinforcement learning. We
showed that a robot with limbs made of tree branches (for which no CAD model or

high-coverage library of motion primitives. The optimized primitives are
entirely non-obvious to a human observer, and thus are unlikely to be

transmitted via a memoryless channel, using delay-limited encoder and decoder,
which are both implementable by periodically-varying finite-state machines, and
the decoder is granted with access to side information, which is a noisy
version of the source sequence. We first derive a lower bound on the achievable
expected distortion in terms of the empirical statistics of the source
sequence, the number of states of the encoder, the number of states of the
decoder, their period, and the overall delay. The bound is shown to be
asymptotically achievable by universal block codes in the limit of long blocks.
We also derive a lower bound to the best achievable excess--distortion
probability and discuss situations where it is achievable. Here, of course,
source coding and channel coding cannot be completely separated without loss of
optimality. Finally, we outline a few extensions of the model considered, such

to suppress the less relevant channels and enhance the detection
generalizability. Three gating mechanisms with different structures are
proposed and integrated into Res2Net. Experimental results conducted on
ASVspoof 2019 logical access (LA) demonstrate that the proposed CG-Res2Net
significantly outperforms Res2Net on both the overall LA evaluation set and

solving a decomposable optimisation problem over a general network. In this
paper, we revisit PDMM for optimisation over a centralized network. We first
note that the recently proposed method FedSplit [1] implements PDMM for a
centralized network. In [1], Inexact FedSplit (i.e., gradient based FedSplit)
was also studied both empirically and theoretically. We identify the cause for
the poor reported performance of Inexact FedSplit, which is due to the improper
initialisation in the gradient operations at the client side. To fix the issue
of Inexact FedSplit, we propose two versions of Inexact PDMM, which are
referred to as gradient-based PDMM (GPDMM) and accelerated GPDMM (AGPDMM),
respectively. AGPDMM accelerates GPDMM at the cost of transmitting two times
the number of parameters from the server to each client per iteration compared
to GPDMM. We provide a new convergence bound for GPDMM for a class of convex
optimisation problems. Our new bounds are tighter than those derived for
Inexact FedSplit. We also investigate the update expressions of AGPDMM and
SCAFFOLD to find their similarities. It is found that when the number K of
gradient steps at the client side per iteration is K=1, both AGPDMM and
SCAFFOLD reduce to vanilla gradient descent with proper parameter setup.
Experimental results indicate that AGPDMM converges faster than SCAFFOLD when
K>1 while GPDMM converges slightly worse than SCAFFOLD.

a small mass ratio and a low mass ($\leq 5M_\odot$) of the light component, and
find tentative evidence for a mass correlation among the objects. To evaluate
the feasibility of testing such a hypothesis with upcoming observations, we
carry out simulations with a mock population and perform Bayesian hierarchical

stochastic collision criterion in a hadronic transport approach (SMASH), which
allows to treat arbitrary multi-particle reactions. It is used to account for
the regeneration of (anti-)protons via $5\pi\rightarrow p\bar{p}$. Our results
show that a back-reaction happens for a fraction of 15-20\% of all
annihilations. Within a viscous hybrid approach Au+Au/Pb+Pb collisions from
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=17.3$ GeV$-5.02$ TeV are investigated and the quoted fraction is
independent of the beam energy or centrality of the collision. Taking the
back-reaction into account results in regeneration of half of the (anti-)proton
yield that is lost due to annihilations at midrapidity. We also find that,
concerning the multiplicities, treating the back-reaction as a chain of 2-body
reactions is equivalent to a single 5-to-2 reaction.

in a cavity subject to quantum-non-demolition detection of photon number, with
a simple linear drive as control. Fock states can be produced and stabilized at
very high fidelity. It is even possible to reach superposition states, provided
the measurement rates for different Fock states can be controlled as well.

are calculated by using the well-known soft-pion theorem in the current-algebra

terms of parity-conserving matrix elements. From our previous analysis of heavy
baryons we know that short-distance effects induced by internal topologies are
not suppressed in comparison with external $W$-exchange diagram and must be
included for description of data. Here, in the case of $\Lambda$ decays we
found that the contribution of external and internal $W$-exchange diagrams is

crucial to achieve their navigation, path planning, and formation in many
applications, such as emergency response, where acquiring a prior knowledge of
the environment is not possible. The traditional Ultra-WideBand (UWB)-based
approach provides a good estimation of the distance between the robots, but
obtaining the relative pose (including the displacement and orientation)
remains challenging. We propose an approach to estimate the relative pose
between a group of robots by equipping each robot with multiple UWB ranging
nodes. We determine the pose between two robots by minimizing the residual
error of the ranging measurements from all UWB nodes. To improve the
localization accuracy, we propose to utilize the odometry constraints through a
sliding window-based optimization. The optimized pose is then fused with the
odometry in a particle filtering for pose tracking among a group of mobile
robots. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach.

Through the formation of coherently combined polygon modes at both pump and
laser wavelengths, the microlaser exhibits single mode operation with an
ultra-narrow-linewidth of 98 Hz. In combination with the superior electro-optic

straightforward since such CTCs are ""counter-rotating"", i.e., the time
orientation (the opening of the local light cones) of the CTCs is opposite to
the direction in which the singularity or the ergosphere rotates. It was also
suggested that this is a generic phenomenon that calls for a deeper intuitive
physical understanding. In this short note we point out -- with Kerr-Taub-NUT
as an example -- that CTCs are counter-rotating with respect to the local
angular velocity of the spacetime, which makes a physical interpretation of
CTCs being ""caused"" by a rotating source even more problematic.

prevailing ""smooth planar metal-like emitter"" methodology. This new plot form,

for the characterization parameter formal emission area. It can be argued that,
certainly in scientific contexts, the use of MG plots could usefully replace

hard-sphere model and the Widom-Rowlinson model in a region
$\mathbb{V}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. These models are used in statistical physics
to describe mixtures of one or multiple particle types subjected to hard-core
interactions. For each type, particles follow a Poisson point process with a
type specific activity parameter (fugacity). The Gibbs distribution is
characterized by the mixture of these point processes conditioned that no two
particles are closer than a type-dependent distance threshold. A key part in
better understanding the Gibbs distribution is its normalizing constant, called
partition function.
  We give sufficient conditions that the partition function of a discrete
hard-core model on a geometric graph based on a point set $X \subset
\mathbb{V}$ closely approximates those of such continuous models. Previously,
this was only shown for the hard-sphere model on cubic regions $\mathbb{V}=[0,
\ell)^d$ when $X$ is exponential in the volume of the region $\nu(\mathbb{V})$,
limiting algorithmic applications. In the same setting, our refined analysis
only requires a quadratic number of points, which we argue to be tight.
  We use our improved discretization results to approximate the partition
functions of the hard-sphere model and the Widom-Rowlinson efficiently in
$\nu(\mathbb{V})$. For the hard-sphere model, we obtain the first
quasi-polynomial deterministic approximation algorithm for the entire fugacity
regime for which, so far, only randomized approximations are known.
Furthermore, we simplify a recently introduced fully polynomial randomized
approximation algorithm. Similarly, we obtain the best known deterministic and
randomized approximation bounds for the Widom-Rowlinson model. Moreover, we
obtain approximate sampling algorithms for the respective spin systems within
the same fugacity regimes.

its malignancy, it is graded by a pathologist into three grades according to
WHO standards. This grade plays a decisive role in treatment, and yet may be
subject to inter-rater discordance. In this work, we present and compare three
approaches towards fully automatic meningioma grading from histology whole
slide images. All approaches are following a two-stage paradigm, where we first
identify a region of interest based on the detection of mitotic figures in the
slide using a state-of-the-art object detection deep learning network. This
region of highest mitotic rate is considered characteristic for biological
tumor behavior. In the second stage, we calculate a score corresponding to
tumor malignancy based on information contained in this region using three
different settings. In a first approach, image patches are sampled from this
region and regression is based on morphological features encoded by a
ResNet-based network. We compare this to learning a logistic regression from
the determined mitotic count, an approach which is easily traceable and
explainable. Lastly, we combine both approaches in a single network. We trained
the pipeline on 951 slides from 341 patients and evaluated them on a separate
set of 141 slides from 43 patients. All approaches yield a high correlation to
the WHO grade. The logistic regression and the combined approach had the best
results in our experiments, yielding correct predictions in 32 and 33 of all
cases, respectively, with the image-based approach only predicting 25 cases
correctly. Spearman's correlation was 0.716, 0.792 and 0.790 respectively. It
may seem counterintuitive at first that morphological features provided by
image patches do not improve model performance. Yet, this mirrors the criteria
of the grading scheme, where mitotic count is the only unequivocal parameter.

enough on the fisheye images for mass production, partly due to the lack of 3D
datasets of such images. In this paper, we manage to overcome and avoid the
difficulty of acquiring the large scale of accurate 3D labeled truth data, by
breaking down the 3D object detection task into some sub-tasks, such as
vehicle's contact point detection, type classification, re-identification and
unit assembling, etc. Particularly, we propose the concept of Multidimensional
Vector to include the utilizable information generated in different dimensions
and stages, instead of the descriptive approach for the bird's eye view (BEV)

that our solution achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being real-time in

manner they had not previously seen, and at making complex decisions about how
to apply an equation to a particular physical situation, although both groups
displayed similar success at solving simpler problems. Both groups identified

approach to robot manipulation of novel objects ab initio, without prior object
models or pre-training on a large object data set. The key element of Prompt is
a particle-based object representation, in which each particle represents a
point in the object, the local geometric, physical, and other features of the
point, and also its relation with other particles. Like the model-based
analytic approaches to manipulation, the particle representation enables the
robot to reason about the object's geometry and dynamics in order to choose
suitable manipulation actions. Like the data-driven approaches, the particle
representation is learned online in real-time from visual sensor input,
specifically, multi-view RGB images. The particle representation thus connects
visual perception with robot control. Prompt combines the benefits of both
model-based reasoning and data-driven learning. We show empirically that Prompt
successfully handles a variety of everyday objects, some of which are
transparent. It handles various manipulation tasks, including grasping,
pushing, etc,. Our experiments also show that Prompt outperforms a
state-of-the-art data-driven grasping method on the daily objects, even though
it does not use any offline training data.

(LoRaWAN) due to the coexistence with other networks in ISM bands and an
Aloha-like MAC layer. LoRa's Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanism is often
insufficient to retrieve corrupted data. In fact, real-life measurements show
that at least one-fourth of received transmissions are corrupted. When more
frames are dropped, LoRa nodes usually switch over to higher spreading factors
(SF), thus increasing transmission times and increasing the required energy.
This paper introduces ReDCoS, a novel coding technique at the application layer
that improves recovery of corrupted LoRa frames, thus reducing the overall
transmission time and energy invested by LoRa nodes by several-fold. ReDCoS
utilizes lightweight coding techniques to pre-encode the transmitted data.
Therefore, the inbuilt Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) that follows is computed
based on an already encoded data. At the receiver, we use both the CRC and the
coded data to recover data from a corrupted frame beyond the built-in Error
Correcting Code (ECC). We compare the performance of ReDCoS to (I) the standard
FEC of vanilla-LoRaWAN, and to (ii) RS coding applied as ECC to the data of
LoRaWAN. The results indicated a 54x and 13.5x improvement of decoding ratio,
respectively, when 20 data symbols were sent. Furthermore, we evaluated ReDCoS
on-field using LoRa SX1261 transceivers showing that it outperformed RS-coding
by factor of at least 2x (and up to 6x) in terms of the decoding ratio while
consuming 38.5% less energy per correctly received transmission.

are usually produced by ejecting a volume of fluid through a circular orifice
or nozzle. When the volume and velocity of the ejected fluid are known, the
vortex' circulation, impulse, and energy can be estimated by the slug flow
model. Vortex rings also form in the wake of accelerating axisymmetric bodies.
In this configuration, the volume and velocity of the fluid that is injected
into the vortex is not known a priori. Here, we present two models to predict
the growth of the vortex behind disks or cones. The first model uses conformal
mapping and assumes that all vorticity generated ends up in the vortex. The
vortex circulation is determined by imposing the Kutta condition at the tip of
the disk. The position of the vortex is integrated from an approximation of its
velocity, given by Fraenkel. The model predicts well the maximum circulation of
the vortex, but does not predict the tail shedding observed experimentally. A
second model is based on an axisymmetric version of the discrete vortex method.
The shear layer formed at the tip of the cone is discretised by point vortices,
which roll-up into a coherent vortex ring. The model accurately captures the
temporal evolution of the circulation and the non-dimensional energy. The
detrainment of vorticity from the vortex, through the process of tail shedding,
is qualitatively captured by the model but remains quantitatively sensitive to
the numerical parameters.

protects the privacy of each client by exchanging model parameters rather than

a considerable number of model parameters need to be transmitted many times
during the training process, making the approach inefficient, especially when
the communication network bandwidth is limited. This article proposes RingFed,
a novel framework to reduce communication overhead during the training process
of federated learning. Rather than transmitting parameters between the center
server and each client, as in original federated learning, in the proposed
RingFed, the updated parameters are transmitted between each client in turn,
and only the final result is transmitted to the central server, thereby
reducing the communication overhead substantially. After several local updates,
clients first send their parameters to another proximal client, not to the
center server directly, to preaggregate. Experiments on two different public
datasets show that RingFed has fast convergence, high model accuracy, and low
communication cost.

enabling the realization of gated structures in which two electrodes are
separated by atomic scale distances. The electrical capacitance of these
structures is determined by phenomena that are not relevant in capacitors with
larger electrode separation. With the aim to analyze these phenomena, we use
linear response theory to develop a systematic description of capacitance for
two coupled electron liquids, accounting for the wave nature of electrons, as
well as for the effect of both intra and interlayer Coulomb interactions. Our
theory leads to a general expression for the electrical capacitance in terms of
both intra and interlayer electronic polarizabilities. The intralayer
polarizability is directly related to the conventional expression for the
quantum capacitance, whereas the interlayer polarizability term accounts for
interaction-induced correlations between charges hosted by opposite capacitor
plates. We refer to this latter term as to the cross quantum capacitance. We
discuss the implications of the general expression for the capacitance, show
that it leads to established results when the effect of interlayer correlations
is negligible, and that the intra and interlayer polarizabilities play a
comparable role for capacitors with very small electrode separation. Using two
different approaches, we calculate the capacitance in specific cases, and find
that the interlayer polarizability can be either positive or negative, so that
the cross quantum capacitance can either increase or decrease the total
capacitance. We conclude by showing that the cross quantum capacitance term can
lead to a non-monotonic evolution of the total capacitance with increasing
separation between the capacitor plates, which would represent an unambiguous
manifestation of the cross quantum capacitance if observed experimentally.

allow to understand, and even predict, complex physical or chemical phenomena
on the basis of the fundamental laws of nature. Among the different existing
atomic scale simulation approaches, molecular dynamics (MD) has imposed itself
as the method of choice to model the behavior of the structure of materials
under the action of external stimuli, say temperature, strain or stress,
irradiation, etc. Despite the widespread use of MD in condensed matter science,
some basic material characteristics remain difficult to determine. This is for
instance the case of the long-range strain tensor in heavily disordered
materials, or the quantification of rotated crystalline domains lacking clearly
defined boundaries. In this work, we introduce computational diffraction as a
fast and reliable structural characterization tool of atomic scale simulation
cells. As compared to usual direct-space methods, computational diffraction
operates in the reciprocal-space and is therefore highly sensitive to
long-range spatial correlations. With the example of defective UO2, it is
demonstrated that the homogeneous strain tensor, the heterogeneous strain
tensor, the disorder, as well as rotated crystallites are straightforwardly and
unambiguously determined. Computational diffraction can be applied to any type
of atomic scale simulation and can be performed in real time, in parallel with
other analysis tools. In experimental workflows, diffraction and microscopy are
almost systematically used together in order to benefit from their
complementarity. Computational diffraction, used together with computational
microscopy, can potentially play a major role in the future of atomic scale

computation capabilities of the advanced edge servers make it possible to
deploy learning tasks at the wireless network edge, which is dubbed as edge
intelligence (EI). The communication bottleneck between the data resource and
the server results in deteriorated learning performance as well as tremendous
energy consumption. To tackle this challenge, we explore a new paradigm called
learning-and-energy-efficient (LEE) EI, which simultaneously maximizes the
learning accuracies and energy efficiencies of multiple tasks via data
partition and rate control. Mathematically, this results in a multi-objective
optimization problem. Moreover, the continuous varying rates over the whole
transmission duration introduce infinite variables. To solve this complex
problem, we consider the case with infinite server buffer capacity and one-shot
data arrival at sensor. First, the number of variables are reduced to a finite
level by exploiting the optimality of constant-rate transmission in each epoch.
Second, the optimal solution is found by applying stratified sequencing or
objectives merging. By assuming higher priority of learning efficiency in
stratified sequencing, the closed form of optimal data partition is derived by
the Lagrange method, while the optimal rate control is proved to have the
structure of directional water filling (DWF), based on which a string-pulling
(SP) algorithm is proposed to obtain the numerical values. The DWF structure of
rate control is also proved to be optimal in objectives merging via weighted
summation. By exploiting the optimal rate changing properties, the SP algorithm
is further extended to account for the cases with limited server buffer
capacity or bursty data arrival at sensor. The performance of the proposed
design is examined by extensive experiments based on public datasets.

Density (PSD) of AGN. The machine is trained using simulated PSDs in the form
of a simple power-law encoded with the relativistic echo features. Dictionary
Learning and sparse coding algorithms are used for the PSD reconstruction, by
transforming the noisy PSD to a representative sparse version. Then, the
Support Vector Machine is employed to extract the interpretable reverberation
features from the reconstructed PSD that holds the information of the source
height. The results show that the accuracy of predicting the source height,
$h$, is genuinely high and the misclassification is only found when $h$ >
15$r_g$. When the test PSD has a bending power-law shape, which is completely
new to the machine, the accuracy is still high. Therefore, the ML model does
not require the intrinsic shape of the PSD to be determined in advance. By
focusing on the PSD parameter space observed in real AGN data, classification
for $h \leq$ 10$r_g$ can be determined with 100% accuracy, even using a PSD in
an energy band that contains a reflection flux as low as 10% of the total flux.
For $h$ > 10$r_g$, the data, if misclassified, will have small uncertainties of
$\Delta h$ ~ 2-4$r_g$. This work shows, as a proof of concept, that the ML

the critical challenges in deep reinforcement learning. A representative
solution is to leverage reward shaping to provide intrinsic rewards for the
agent to encourage exploration. However, most existing methods suffer from
vanishing intrinsic rewards, which cannot provide sustainable exploration
incentives. Moreover, they rely heavily on complex models and additional memory
to record learning procedures, resulting in high computational complexity and
low robustness. To tackle this problem, entropy-based methods are proposed to
evaluate the global exploration performance, encouraging the agent to visit the
state space more equitably. However, the sample complexity of estimating the
state visitation entropy is prohibitive when handling environments with
high-dimensional observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric
entitled Jain's fairness index (JFI) to replace the entropy regularizer, which
solves the exploration problem from a brand new perspective. In sharp contrast
to the entropy regularizer, JFI is more computable and robust and can be easily
applied generalized into arbitrary tasks. Furthermore, we leverage a
variational auto-encoder (VAE) model to capture the life-long novelty of
states, which is combined with the global JFI score to form multimodal
intrinsic rewards. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that our
multimodal reward shaping (MMRS) method can achieve higher performance than
other benchmark schemes.

random pullback attractors, the concept of asymptotic compactness (AC) is used.
In bounded domains, AC is proved via compact Sobolev embeddings. In unbounded
domains, due to the lack of compact embeddings, the ideas of energy equations
and uniform tail estimates are exploited to prove AC. In the literature, CBF
equations are also known as \emph{Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with damping},
and it is interesting to see that the modification in NSE by linear and
nonlinear damping provides better results than that available for NSE. The
presence of linear damping term helps to establish the results in the whole
domain $\mathbb{R}^d$. The nonlinear damping term supports to obtain better
results in 3D and also for a large class of nonlinear diffusion terms.
Moreover, we prove the existence of a unique random pullback attractor for
stochastic CBF equations with additive white noise. Finally, for additive as
well as multiplicative noise case, we establish the convergence of solutions

limit their learning performance. We justify that the performance limitation is
caused by the gradient vanishing on these sample outliers. Moreover, the
shortage of positive data and disregard for global discrimination consideration
also pose critical issues for unsupervised learning but are always ignored by
existing methods. To handle these issues, we propose a novel solution to
explicitly model and directly explore the uncertainty of the given unlabeled
learning samples. Instead of learning a deterministic feature point for each
sample in the embedding space, we propose to represent a sample by a stochastic
Gaussian with the mean vector depicting its space localization and covariance
vector representing the sample uncertainty. We leverage such uncertainty
modeling as momentum to the learning which is helpful to tackle the outliers.

late-type galaxies are on average more rotation dominated, and the formation of
nuclear stellar structures is potentially linked to the presence of gas
funnelled to the center. Early-type galaxies, in contrast, tend to display
slower-rotating NSCs with lower ellipticity. However, some exceptions suggest
that in specific cases, early-type hosts can form NSCs in a way similar to

deployed in MLaaS face the threat of model extraction attacks. A model
extraction attack is an attack to violate intellectual property and privacy in
which an adversary steals trained models in a cloud using only their
predictions. In particular, a data-free model extraction attack has been
proposed recently and is more critical. In this attack, an adversary uses a
generative model instead of preparing input data. The feasibility of this
attack, however, needs to be studied since it requires more queries than that
with surrogate datasets. In this paper, we propose MEGEX, a data-free model
extraction attack against a gradient-based explainable AI. In this method, an
adversary uses the explanations to train the generative model and reduces the
number of queries to steal the model. Our experiments show that our proposed
method reconstructs high-accuracy models -- 0.97$\times$ and 0.98$\times$ the
victim model accuracy on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets given 2M and 20M queries,

scenario and the self-similar solution without the coincidence problem,
respectively. The case of $\xi = Constant$ has been investigated in the
previous studies, while we further consider the case of $\xi(z) = \xi_{0} +
\xi_{z}*\frac{z}{1+z}$ to explore the possible evolution. A joint analysis of
the Pantheon SNe Ia sample with the recent BAO and CMB data figures out that
$\xi=3.28\pm0.15$ in the case of $\xi = Constant$ at $68\%$ confidence level

0.93_{-0.91}^{+1.56}$ in the case of $\xi(z)$ at $68\%$ CL. It implies that the
temporal evolution of the scaling parameter $\xi$ is accepted by the joint
sample at $68\%$ CL; however, the joint sample also cannot distinguish whether
the scaling parameter $\xi$ is variable or not at 95\% CL. Moreover, the
$\Lambda$CDM scenario is accepted by the joint sample at $95\%$ CL in both
cases, and the coincidence problem still exists. In addition, we apply the
Bayesian evidence to compare the models with the analysis of the joint sample,
it turns out that the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is most supported by the joint
sample; furthermore, the joint sample prefers the scenario with a constant
$\xi$ to the one with a variable $\xi(z)$.

chases exclusively a single member of the basic model composed by three
cyclically dominant species. Interestingly, the coexistence is not necessarily
broken and we have detected three consecutive phase transitions as we vary only
the invasion strength of the fourth pestilent species. The resulting phases are
analyzed by different techniques including the study of the Hamming distance
density profiles. Some of our observations strengthen previous findings about
cyclically dominant system, but they also offer new revelations and
counter-intuitive phenomenon, like supporting pestilent species may result in
its extinction, hence enriching our understanding about these very simple but
still surprisingly complex systems.

(BH). The inner binary system was defined as a star estimated to be at the end
of its main sequence and a dormant BH. As the inner binary is not resolved, the
third component may actually just be spatially coinciding with the inner
binary. In this study we test whether the system inner binary can be
reconstructed using the isolated binary evolution in the Galactic field or
through the dynamical evolution within globular star clusters. Our goal is to
understand the formation of the HR 6819 inner binary. To simulate the inner
binary evolution we assumed that the influence of the third body on the inner
binary is negligible. We created synthetic populations of BH main-sequence
binaries for the Galactic disc and the Galactic globular clusters to compare to
the reported parameters of the HR 6819 inner binary. We have adopted very
optimistic input physics, in terms of common envelope evolution and BH
formation, for the formation of binaries similar to the reported inner HR 6819
binary. Despite our optimistic assumptions we cannot form systems like the
inner HR 6819 binary in globular clusters. Even with our extreme assumptions,
the formation of an HR 6819-like binary in the Galactic field population is not
expected. We argue that if a dormant BH actually exists in the reported

models based on isolated and dynamical binary evolution.

Among the diseases associated with protein aggregates, for example, Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is of relevant importance. Although understanding the
processes that cause the disease is still an open challenge, its relationship
with protein aggregation is widely known. In particular, human TDP-43, an
RNA/DNA binding protein, is a major component of pathological cytoplasmic
inclusions described in ALS patients. The deposition of the phosphorylated
full-length TDP-43 in spinal cord cells has been widely studied, and it has
been shown that the brain cortex presents an accumulation of phosphorylated
C-terminal fragments (CTFs). Even if it is debated whether CTFs represent a
primary cause of ALS, they are a hallmark of TDP-43 related neurodegeneration
in the brain. Here, we investigate the CTFs aggregation process, providing a
possible computational model of interaction based on the evaluation of shape
complementarity at the interfaces. To this end, extensive Molecular Dynamics
(MD) simulations were conducted for different types of fragments with the aim
of exploring the equilibrium configurations. Adopting a newly developed
approach based on Zernike polynomials, for finding complementary regions of the
molecular surface, we sampled a large set of exposed portions of the molecular
surface of CTFs structures as obtained from MD simulations. The analysis
proposes a set of possible associations between the CTFs, which could drive the

$\lesssim$ AU scale density structures in the ionized interstellar medium,
whose astrophysical correspondence is still a mystery. The detailed study of
Brisken et al. suggested two possible morphologies for these structures: a
parallel set of filaments or sheets (the `parallel stripes model'), or a
filament broken up into denser knots (the `threaded beads model'). Here we
propose a straightforward test that can distinguish these two morphologies:
whether the apex of the main parabolic arc created by the scattered images
deviates from the origin of the scintillation spectrum or not. In the `parallel
stripes' model, the scattered images move along the stripes as the relative
position of the pulsar moves. As a result, the pulsar is always co-linear with
the scattered images, and thus the apex of the main parabolic arc stays at the
origin of the scintillation spectrum. In the `threaded beads' model, the
scattered images remain at almost fixed positions relative to the density
structures, and thus the pulsar is not co-linear with the scattered images at
most times, leading to an offset between the apex and the origin. Looking for
this possible offset in a large sample of pulsar scintillation spectra, or
monitoring the evolution of parabolic arcs will help pin down the morphology of
these tiny density structures and constrain their astrophysical origin.

temperature owing to the presence of the energy gap in their density of states

tune the local DOS of a metallic wire by controlling the phase bias ($\varphi$)
imposed across it. As a result, the wire thermal conductance can be tuned over
several orders of magnitude by phase manipulation. Despite strong implications
in nanoscale heat management, experimental proofs of phase-driven control of
thermal transport in superconducting proximitized nanostructures are still very
limited. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of efficient heat
current control by phase tuning the superconducting proximity effect. This is
achieved by exploiting the magnetic flux-driven manipulation of the DOS of a
quasi one-dimensional aluminum nanowire forming a weal-link embedded in a

(HDM vs. ADM) and prioritization of a specific social group (teachers vs.

systems and preference for vaccination of a specific social group influence the
legitimacy of vaccine allocation. However, contrary to our expectations, trust
in the agent making the decision did not moderate the link between social group

different sensor types. Radar continues to function robustly in compromised

memory requirements of both high-dimensional measurements through a decoupled
stochastic self-supervised compression technique, the proposed algorithm
exploits similarities and establishes correspondences between both domains at
different feature levels during training. Then, at inference time, relying
exclusively on radio frequencies, the model successively predicts camera

theoretical considerations for active polar liquids have highlighted that
physical mechanisms induce motility through splay and bend configurations in a

thermodynamic principles, for active polar free-surface droplets to identify a
different mechanism of motility. Namely, active stresses drive drop motion
through spatial variations of polarization strength. This robustly induces
parity-symmetry breaking and motility even for liquid ridges (2D drops) and
adds to splay- and bend-driven pumping in 3D geometries. Intriguingly, then,
stable polar moving and axisymmetric resting states may coexist, reminiscent of
the interconversion of moving and resting keratocytes by external stimuli. The
identified additional motility mode originates from a competition between the
elastic bulk energy and the polarity control exerted by the drop surface. As it
already breaks parity-symmetry for passive drops, the resulting back-forth
asymmetry enables active stresses to effectively pump liquid and drop motion
ensues.

$Gaia$-CRF catalogues is a key step in assessing their systematic errors and
determining their mutual orientation. One of the main factors that limits the
accuracy of determination of the orientation parameters between two frames is
the impact of outliers. To mitigate this effect, a new method is proposed based
on pixelization data over the equal-area cells, followed by median filtering of
the data in each cell. After this, a new data set is formed, consisting of data
points near-uniformly distributed over the sphere. The vector spherical
harmonics (VSH) decomposition is then applied to this data to finally compute
the orientation parameters between ICRF and $Gaia$ frames. To validate the
proposed approach, a comparison was made of the ICRF3-SX and $Gaia$~DR2
catalogues using several methods for outliers removal. The results of this work
showed that the proposed method is practically insensitive to outliers and thus
provides much more robust results of catalogues comparison than the methods
used so far. This conclusion was confirmed by analogous test comparison of the
$Gaia$~DR2 and OCARS catalogues.

we show that it is possible without traversing the block's Merkle tree.
  We obtain weight statistics of a leaf path on a sparse Merkle tree
theoretically, as our ground case. Using the theory we quantify the
communication cost of a client interacting with the blockchain. We show that
large savings can be achieved by providing a bitmap index of the tree

correlated access, as in two IoT devices posting messages for each other in

re-randomising the IDs using a pseudorandom bijective function. We propose a
low-cost function of this kind and evaluate its quality by simulation, using

density, relevant to hybrid star (HS) cores, is studied in the present work.
The effective chiral model describes the pure hadronic phase while for the
quark phase the MIT bag model is chosen with density dependent bag pressure.
Phase transition is achieved using Maxwell construction. The effect of
variation of the asymptotic value of the bag pressure ($B_{as}$) is analyzed
w.r.t to the mass and radius of the HSs. The presence of hyperons in the
hadronic sector also has significant effect on the choice of the value of
$B_{as}$. Both the hadronic composition and the choice of $B_{as}$
significantly affect the stability of the star. The gross structural properties
of the resultant HS are calculated in static condition and compared with the
various constraints on them from different observational and empirical
perspectives. The static properties like the maximum gravitational mass of the
HS, obtained with $B_{as}$=80 MeV fm$^{-3}$, is consistent with the limits
imposed from the observational analysis of PSR J0348+0432 and PSR J0740+6620.
The estimates of $R_{1.4}$ and $R_{1.6}$ of HSs are found to be within the
range prescribed from GW170817 analysis. Also the $M-R$ solutions of the HSs
are in excellent agreement with the recently obtained NICER data for PSR

growth in the inflation rate has compelled people to invest in the stock and
commodity markets and other areas rather than saving. Further, the ability of
Deep Learning models to make predictions on the time series data has been
proven time and again. Technical analysis on the stock market with the help of
technical indicators has been the most common practice among traders and
investors. One more aspect is the sentiment analysis - the emotion of the
investors that shows the willingness to invest. A variety of techniques have
been used by people around the globe involving basic Machine Learning and
Neural Networks. Ranging from the basic linear regression to the advanced
neural networks people have experimented with all possible techniques to
predict the stock market. It's evident from recent events how news and
headlines affect the stock markets and cryptocurrencies. This paper proposes an
ensemble of state-of-the-art methods for predicting stock prices. Firstly
sentiment analysis of the news and the headlines for the company Apple Inc,
listed on the NASDAQ is performed using a version of BERT, which is a
pre-trained transformer model by Google for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Afterward, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) predicts the stock price for
Apple Inc using the technical indicators, stock indexes of various countries,
some commodities, and historical prices along with the sentiment scores.
Comparison is done with baseline models like - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),
Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), vanilla GAN, and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving

lead to alterations in encoded polypeptides. Changes in the amino acid
sequences of gene products lead to Leukemia. First, we study individual SNPs in
the coding region of FANCA and computational tools like PROVEAN, PolyPhen2,
MuPro, and PANTHER to compute deleterious mutation scores. The
three-dimensional structural and functional prediction conducted using
I-TASSER. Further, the predicted structure refined using the GlaxyWeb tool. In
the study, the proteomic data has been retrieved from the UniProtKB. The coding
region of the dataset contains 100 non-synonymous single nucleotide
polymorphisms (nsSNPs), and 24 missense SNPs have been determined as
deleterious by all analyses. In this work, six well-known computational tools
were employed to study Leukemia-associated nsSNPs. It is inferred that these
nsSNPs could play their role in the up-regulation of FANCA, which further leads
to provoke leukemia advancement. The current research would benefit researchers
and practitioners in handling cancer-associated diseases related to FANCA. The
proposed study would also help to develop precision medicine in the field of

derivation of reliable non-rigid motion fields from the undersampled

formalism to perform non-rigid registration directly in the sampled Fourier

to assemble complex silhouettes, match a specific curvature profile in
industrial design, and construct smooth, comfortable, and safe trajectories in

evaluate, and deform aesthetic curves are expected to improve the throughput
and the quality of industrial design. In recent years, the study of (log)
aesthetic curves have attracted the community's attention due to its ubiquity
in natural phenomena such as bird eggs, butterfly wings, falcon flights, and
manufactured products such as Japanese swords and automobiles.
  A (log) aesthetic curve renders a logarithmic curvature graph approximated by
a straight line, and polar aesthetic curves enable to mode user-defined
dynamics of the polar tangential angle in the polar coordinate system. As such,
the curvature profile often becomes a by-product of the tangential angle.
  In this paper, we extend the concept of polar aesthetic curves and establish
the analytical formulations to construct aesthetic curves with user-defined
criteria. In particular, we propose the closed-form analytic characterizations
of polar log-aesthetic curves meeting user-defined criteria of curvature
profiles and dynamics of polar tangential angles. We present numerical examples
portraying the feasibility of rendering the logarithmic curvature graphs
represented by a straight line. Our approach enables the seamless
characterization of aesthetic curves in the polar coordinate system, which can
model aesthetic shapes with desirable aesthetic curvature profiles.

attacks. The adversary can easily change the outputs of DNNs by adding small
well-designed perturbations to inputs. Adversarial example detection is a
fundamental work for robust DNNs-based service. Adversarial examples show the
difference between humans and DNNs in image recognition. From a human-centric
perspective, image features could be divided into dominant features that are
comprehensible to humans, and recessive features that are incomprehensible to
humans, yet are exploited by DNNs. In this paper, we reveal that imperceptible
adversarial examples are the product of recessive features misleading neural
networks, and an adversarial attack is essentially a kind of method to enrich
these recessive features in the image. The imperceptibility of the adversarial
examples indicates that the perturbations enrich recessive features, yet hardly
affect dominant features. Therefore, adversarial examples are sensitive to
filtering off recessive features, while benign examples are immune to such
operation. Inspired by this idea, we propose a label-only adversarial detection
approach that is referred to as feature-filter. Feature-filter utilizes
discrete cosine transform to approximately separate recessive features from
dominant features, and gets a mutant image that is filtered off recessive
features. By only comparing DNN's prediction labels on the input and its
mutant, feature-filter can real-time detect imperceptible adversarial examples
at high accuracy and few false positives.

Recognition systems recently published are very accurate, but often require
powerful machinery (specialised Graphical Processing Units) for inference,
which makes them impractical to run on commodity devices, especially in
streaming mode. Impressed by the accuracy of, but dissatisfied with the
inference times of the baseline Kazakh ASR model of (Khassanov et al.,2021)

dataset as the aforementioned paper) and three language models for use with the
Coqui STT framework. Results look promising, but further epochs of training and
parameter sweeping or, alternatively, limiting the vocabulary that the ASR
system must support, is needed to reach a production-level accuracy.

porous media from their digital images. Unlike convolutional neural networks,
instead of feeding the whole image volume as inputs to the network, we model
the boundary between solid matrix and pore spaces as point clouds and feed them
as inputs to a neural network based on the PointNet architecture. This approach
overcomes the challenge of memory restriction of graphics processing units and
its consequences on the choice of batch size, and convergence. Compared to
convolutional neural networks, the proposed deep learning methodology provides
freedom to select larger batch sizes, due to reducing significantly the size of
network inputs. Specifically, we use the classification branch of PointNet and
adjust it for a regression task. As a test case, two and three dimensional
synthetic digital rock images are considered. We investigate the effect of
different components of our neural network on its performance. We compare our
deep learning strategy with a convolutional neural network from various
perspectives, specifically for maximum possible batch size. We inspect the
generalizability of our network by predicting the permeability of real-world
rock samples as well as synthetic digital rocks that are statistically
different from the samples used during training. The network predicts the
permeability of digital rocks a few thousand times faster than a Lattice
Boltzmann solver with a high level of prediction accuracy.

three dimensions. We investigate the space of configurations, described in
terms of joint angles of its spherical joints, that satisfy the the loop
closure constraint, meaning that the kinematic chain is closed. In special
cases, we can find a new set of parameters that describe the diagonal lengths
(the distance of the joints from the origin) of the configuration space by a
simple domain, namely a cube of dimension $n-3$. We expect that the new
findings can be applied to various problems such as motion planning for closed
kinematic chains or singularity analysis of their configuration spaces. To
demonstrate the practical feasibility of the new method, we present numerical

issue, we propose a residual tree aggregation of layers for Transformer(RTAL),
which helps to fuse information across layers. Specifically, we try to fuse the
information across layers by constructing a post-order binary tree. In
additional to the last node, we add the residual connection to the process of
generating child nodes. Our model is based on the Neural Machine Translation

introduce GANCA, a novel algorithm that combines Neural Cellular Automata with
Generative Adversarial Networks, allowing for more generalization through
adversarial training. The experiments show that a single model is capable of

millions of people across the world. The mortality rate of this disease is high
in patients suffering from immuno-compromised disorders. The early diagnosis of
this disease can save lives and can avoid further complications. But the
diagnosis of TB is a very complex task. The standard diagnostic tests still
rely on traditional procedures developed in the last century. These procedures
are slow and expensive. So this paper presents an automatic approach for the
diagnosis of TB from posteroanterior chest x-rays. This is a two-step approach,
where in the first step the lung regions are segmented from the chest x-rays
using the graph cut method, and then in the second step the transfer learning
of VGG16 combined with Bi-directional LSTM is used for extracting high-level
discriminative features from the segmented lung regions and then classification
is performed using a fully connected layer. The proposed model is evaluated
using data from two publicly available databases namely Montgomery Country set
and Schezien set. The proposed model achieved accuracy and sensitivity of
97.76%, 97.01% and 96.42%, 94.11% on Schezien and Montgomery county datasets.
This model enhanced the diagnostic accuracy of TB by 0.7% and 11.68% on

multi-scale texturing induced by ultrafast laser processing (340 fs pulse
duration, 1030 nm wavelength) has been investigated with the aim of evaluating
its potential for surface protection. The contact angle (CA) of a water drop
placed on the surface was used to assess the wettability of the processed
areas. Although the surfaces are initially hydrophilic upon laser treatment,
after a few days they develop a strong hydrophobic behavior. Marble surfaces
have been irradiated with different scan line separations to elucidate the
relative roles of multi-scale roughness (nano- and micro-texture) and chemical
changes at the surface. The time evolution of the contact angle has been then
monitored up to 11 months after treatment. A short and a long-term evolution,
associated to the combined effect of multi-scale roughness and the attachment
of chemical species at the surface over the time, have been observed. XPS and
ATR measurements are consistent with the progressive hydroxylation of the laser
treated surfaces although the additional contribution of hydrocarbon adsorbates
to the wettability evolution cannot be ruled-out. The robustness of the results
has been tested by CA measurements after cleaning in different conditions with
very positive results.
