for incorporating adaptive spatial resolution into weakly-compressible Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) schemes. Particles are adaptively split and merged
in an accurate manner. Critically, the method ensures that the number of
neighbors of each particle is optimal, leading to an efficient algorithm. A set
of background particles is used to specify either geometry-based spatial
resolution, where the resolution is a function of distance to a solid body, or
solution-based adaptive resolution, where the resolution is a function of the
computed solution. This allows us to simulate problems using particles having
length variations of the order of 1:250 with much fewer particles than
currently reported with other techniques. The method is designed to
automatically adapt when any solid bodies move. The algorithms employed are
fully parallel. We consider a suite of benchmark problems to demonstrate the
accuracy of the approach. We then consider the classic problem of the flow past
a circular cylinder at a range of Reynolds numbers and show that the proposed
method produces accurate results with a significantly reduced number of
particles. We provide an open source implementation and a fully reproducible

particular for hash-maps. We use lightweight piece-wise linear models to
replace the hash functions as they have small inference times and are
sufficiently general to capture complex distributions. We analyze the learned
models in terms of: the model inference time and the number of collisions.
Surprisingly, we found that learned models are not much slower to compute than
hash functions if optimized correctly. However, it turns out that learned
models can only reduce the number of collisions (i.e., the number of times
different keys have the same hash value) if the model is able to over-fit to
the data; otherwise, it can not be better than an ordinary hash function.
Hence, how much better a learned model is in avoiding collisions highly depends
on the data and the ability of the model to over-fit. To evaluate the
effectiveness of learned models, we used them as hash functions in the bucket
chaining and Cuckoo hash tables. For bucket chaining hash table, we found that
learned models can achieve 30% smaller sizes and 10% lower probe latency. For
Cuckoo hash tables, in some datasets, learned models can increase the ratio of
keys stored in their primary locations by around 10%. In summary, we found that
learned models can indeed outperform hash functions but only for certain data
distributions and with a limited margin.

descent method to locally minimize a loss function and then makes a further
adjustment. Efforts to improve the analysis of the TS algorithm remain
unsuccessful in the past 15 years.
  This work makes the first progress in showing that the bound of 0.3393 is
indeed tight for the TS algorithm. We also present a thorough theoretical
worst-case analysis and give a computable equivalent condition of tight
instances. With this condition, we provide a tight instance generator for the
TS algorithm. Empirically, most generated instances are unstable, that is, a
small perturbation near a 0.3393 solution may help the TS algorithm find
another faraway solution with a much better approximation ratio. Meanwhile, the
existence of stable tight instances indicates the perturbation cannot improve
0.3393 bound in worst cases for the TS algorithm. Furthermore, we test
approximate algorithms other than the TS algorithm on these generated
instances. Two approximate algorithms, the regret-matching algorithm and the
fictitious play algorithm, can find solutions with approximation ratios far
better than 0.3393. Interestingly, the distributed approximate algorithm by
Czumaj et al. finds solutions with the same approximation ratio of 0.3393 on
these generated instances. Such results demonstrate that our generated
instances against the TS algorithm serve as a necessary benchmark in design and
analysis of approximate Nash equilibrium algorithms. Finally, we show that our
techniques can be further generalized to prove the tightness of recently

we go on to show empirically in examples, using ReLU networks, that the
distribution of the slope of a well-trained neural network classifier is
generally independent of the width of the layers in a fully connected network,

architecture in general. The slope is of similar size throughout the relevant
volume, and varies smoothly. It also behaves as predicted in rescaling

continuous-variable quantum information processing which paves the way for
abundant applications, especially including network-based quantum computation
and communication. To make the most use of the Gaussian processes, it is
required to understand and utilize suitable mathematical tools such as the
symplectic space, symplectic algebra, and Wigner representation. Applying these
mathematical tools to practical quantum scenarios, we developed various schemes
for quantum transduction, interference-based bosonic mode permutation and
bosonic sensing. We demonstrated that generic coupler characterized by Gaussian
unitary process can be transformed into a high-fidelity transducer, assuming
the access to infinite squeezing and adaptive feedforward with homodyne
measurements. To address the practical limitation of finite squeezing, we
explored the interference-based protocols. These protocols let us freely
permute bosonic modes only assuming the access to single-mode Gaussian
operations and multiple uses of a given multi-mode Gaussian process. Thus, such
a scheme not only enables universal decoupling for bosonic systems, which is
useful for suppressing undesired coupling between the system and the
environment, but also faithful bidirectional single-mode quantum transduction.
Moreover, noticing that the Gaussian processes are appropriate theoretical
models for optical sensors, we studied the quantum noise theory for optical
parameter sensing and its potential in providing great measurement precision
enhancement. We also extended the Gaussian theories to discrete variable
systems, with several examples such as quantum (gate) teleportation. All the
analyses originated from the fundamental quantum commutation relations, and
therefore are widely applicable.

  Information Perspective","Accepted by SIGKDD'21",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning with graphs has attracted significant attention recently. Existing
representation learning methods on graphs have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on various graph-related tasks such as node classification, link
prediction, etc. However, we observe that these methods could leak serious
private information. For instance, one can accurately infer the links (or node
identity) in a graph from a node classifier (or link predictor) trained on the
learnt node representations by existing methods. To address the issue, we
propose a privacy-preserving representation learning framework on graphs from
the \emph{mutual information} perspective. Specifically, our framework includes
a primary learning task and a privacy protection task, and we consider node
classification and link prediction as the two tasks of interest. Our goal is to
learn node representations such that they can be used to achieve high
performance for the primary learning task, while obtaining performance for the
privacy protection task close to random guessing. We formally formulate our
goal via mutual information objectives. However, it is intractable to compute
mutual information in practice. Then, we derive tractable variational bounds
for the mutual information terms, where each bound can be parameterized via a
neural network. Next, we train these parameterized neural networks to
approximate the true mutual information and learn privacy-preserving node
representations. We finally evaluate our framework on various graph datasets.

devices) to collaboratively train a centralized model while keeping the
training data locally on the client. Compared to traditional centralized
machine learning, FL offers many favorable features such as offloading
operations which would usually be performed by a central server and reducing
risks of serious privacy leakage. However, Byzantine clients that send
incorrect or disruptive updates due to system failures or adversarial attacks
may disturb the joint learning process, consequently degrading the performance
of the resulting model. In this paper, we propose to mitigate these failures
and attacks from a spatial-temporal perspective. Specifically, we use a
clustering-based method to detect and exclude incorrect updates by leveraging
their geometric properties in the parameter space. Moreover, to further handle
malicious clients with time-varying behaviors, we propose to adaptively adjust
the learning rate according to momentum-based update speculation. Extensive
experiments on 4 public datasets demonstrate that our algorithm achieves
enhanced robustness comparing to existing methods under both cross-silo and

  arXiv:2011.09070",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This article provides a novel approach to assess the importance of specific
treatment phases within a treatment regimen through tipping point analyses
(TPA) of a time-to-event endpoint using rank-preserving-structural-failure-time
(RPSFT) modelling. In oncology clinical research, an experimental treatment is
often added to the standard of care therapy in multiple treatment phases to
improve patient outcomes. When the resulting new regimen provides a meaningful
benefit over standard of care, gaining insights into the contribution of each
treatment phase becomes important to properly guide clinical practice. New
statistical approaches are needed since traditional methods are inadequate in
answering such questions. RPSFT modelling is an approach for causal inference,
typically used to adjust for treatment switching in randomized clinical trials
with time-to-event endpoints. A tipping-point analysis is commonly used in
situations where a statistically significant treatment effect is suspected to
be an artifact of missing or unobserved data rather than a real treatment
difference. The methodology proposed in this article is an amalgamation of
these two ideas to investigate the contribution of a specific component of a
regimen comprising multiple treatment phases. We provide different variants of
the method and construct indices of contribution of a treatment phase to the
overall benefit of a regimen that facilitates interpretation of results. The
proposed approaches are illustrated with findings from a recently concluded,
real-life phase 3 cancer clinical trial. We conclude with several
considerations and recommendations for practical implementation of this new
methodology.

factors that could hamper such detections is the astrometric jitter caused by
the magnetic activity of the planet host stars. In our previous study, we
modeled astrometric jitter for the Sun observed equator-on. In this work, we
generalize our model and calculate the photocenter jitter as it would be
measured by the Gaia and Small-JASMINE missions for stars with solar rotation
rate and effective temperature, but with various values of the inclination
angle of the stellar rotation axis. In addition, we consider the effect of
metallicity and of nesting of active regions (i.e. the tendency of active
regions to emerge in the vicinity of each other). We find that, while the
jitter of stars observed equator-on does not have any long-term trends and can
be easily filtered out, the photocenters of stars observed out of their
equatorial planes experience systematic shifts over the course of the activity
cycle. Such trends allow the jitter to be detected with continuous
measurements, in which case it can interfere with planet detectability. An
increase in the metallicity is found to increase the jitter caused by stellar
activity. Active-region nesting can further enhance the peak-to-peak amplitude
of the photocenter jitter to a level that could be detected by Gaia.

Existing works
on understanding opponents focus on preference modeling (or estimating the
opponent's utility function). An important but largely unexplored direction is
recognizing an opponent's negotiation strategy, which captures the opponent's
tactics, e.g., to be tough at the beginning but to concede toward the deadline.
Recognizing complex, state-of-the-art, negotiation strategies is extremely
challenging, and simple heuristics may not be adequate for this purpose. We
propose a novel data-driven approach for recognizing an opponent's s
negotiation strategy. Our approach includes a data generation method for an
agent to generate domain-independent sequences by negotiating with a variety of
opponents across domains, a feature engineering method for representing
negotiation data as time series with time-step features and overall features,
and a hybrid (recurrent neural network-based) deep learning method for
recognizing an opponent's strategy from the time series of bids. We perform
extensive experiments, spanning four problem scenarios, to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

track the shape evolution along the $^{20-42}$Mg isotopic chain, suggesting a

a wireless actuation method is highly advantageous in medical applications, the
trade-off between the applied force and miniature magnetic end effector
dimensions has been one of the main challenges in practical applications in
clinically relevant conditions. This trade-off is crucial for applications
where in-tissue penetration is required (e.g., needle access, biopsy, and
suturing). To increase the forces of such magnetic miniature end effectors to
practically useful levels, we propose an impact-force-based suturing needle
that is capable of penetrating into in-vitro and ex-vivo samples with 3-DoF
planar freedom (planar positioning and in-plane orienting). The proposed
optimized design is a custom-built 12 G needle that can generate 1.16 N
penetration force which is 56 times stronger than its magnetic counterparts
with the same size without such an impact force. By containing the fast-moving
permanent magnet within the needle in a confined tubular structure, the
movement of the overall needle remains slow and easily controllable. The
achieved force is in the range of tissue penetration limits allowing the needle
to be able to penetrate through tissues to follow a suturing method in a
teleoperated fashion. We demonstrated in-vitro needle penetration into a bacon
strip and successful suturing of a gauze mesh onto an agar gel mimicking a
hernia repair procedure.

boundary-layer-conforming grid (BL-conforming grid), in which the grid size
varies to accommodate the growth of the boundary-layer thickness. Our results
are accompanied by a theoretical analysis of the cost and expected error
scaling for the mean pressure coefficient ($C_p$) and mean velocity profiles.
The prediction of $C_p$ is within less than $5\%$ error for all the grids
studied, even when the boundary layers are marginally resolved. The high
accuracy in the prediction of $C_p$ is attributed to the outer-layer nature of
the mean pressure in attached flows. The errors in the predicted mean velocity
profiles exhibit a large variability depending on the location considered,
namely, fuselage, wing-body juncture, or separated trailing-edge. WMLES
performs as expected in regions where the flow resembles a
zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer such as the fuselage ($<5\%$
error). However, there is a decline in accuracy of WMLES predictions of mean
velocities in the vicinity of wing-body junctions and, more acutely, in
separated zones. The impact of the propagation of errors from the underresolved
wing leading-edge is also investigated. It is shown that BL-conforming grids
enable a higher accuracy in wing-body junctions and separated regions due to
the more effective distribution of grid points, which in turn diminishes the
streamwise propagation of errors.

flexibility to encode domain knowledge but can also lead to poor performance

Thompson sampling (TS) with a misspecified prior differs by at most
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^2 \epsilon)$ from TS with a well specified prior, where
$\epsilon$ is the total-variation distance between priors and $H$ is the

cardinality or structure of the action space, and we show that it is tight up
to universal constants in the worst case.

address this problem and formalize a mapping of the concept of temporal network

Consequently, the critical percolation properties of spreading processes on

the directed percolation universality class. This result is robust across a
diverse set of temporal network models with different temporal and topological

problems such as a dipole interacting with a charged wire, the Efimov effect,

requires specification of a boundary condition (regulator) at the origin

elementary example of a quantum anomaly. The system's spectrum qualitatively
changes at a critical value of the inverse-square coupling, and we here point
out that the transition at this critical potential strength can be regarded as
an example of a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition. In particular, we
use point particle effective field theory (PPEFT), as developed by Burgess et

nonunitary physics describing a source or sink at the origin (such as is
appropriate for the charged wire or black hole applications). From this point
of view the RG flow changes character at the critical inverse-square coupling,
transitioning from a sub-critical regime with evolution between two real,
unitary fixed points ($\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric phase) to a super-critical
regime with imaginary, dissipative fixed points ($\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry broken
phase) that represent perfect-sink and perfect-source boundary conditions,
around which the flow executes limit-cycle evolution.

relationship between a risk factor and disease. A fundamental part of any MR
analysis is to choose appropriate genetic variants as instrumental variables.
Genome-wide association studies often reveal that hundreds of genetic variants
may be robustly associated with a risk factor, but in some situations
investigators may have greater confidence in the instrument validity of only a
smaller subset of variants. Nevertheless, the use of additional instruments may
be optimal from the perspective of mean squared error even if they are slightly
invalid; a small bias in estimation may be a price worth paying for a larger
reduction in variance. For this purpose, we consider a method for ""focused""
instrument selection whereby genetic variants are selected to minimise the
estimated asymptotic mean squared error of causal effect estimates. In a
setting of many weak and locally invalid instruments, we propose a novel
strategy to construct confidence intervals for post-selection focused
estimators that guards against the worst case loss in asymptotic coverage. In
empirical applications to: (i) validate lipid drug targets; and (ii)
investigate vitamin D effects on a wide range of outcomes, our findings suggest
that the optimal selection of instruments does not involve only a small number
of biologically-justified instruments, but also many potentially invalid
instruments.

AD baryogenesis scenarios we work with uses the AD field also as the inflaton
which is nonminimally coupled to gravity. We find that adequate baryogenesis
and no washout by the baryon number ($B$) or the lepton number ($L$) violating
operators implies constraints on the observability of the process or in the
case of neutrino mass with compatibility with neutrino oscillation
observations. In particular, for $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation, we study some of the
familiar operators that connect the AD field to $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation and
find that a split scalar spectrum model turns out to be most advantageous for
obtaining an observable $n-\bar{n}$ while remaining consistent with AD
baryogenesis. It is interesting that this spectrum is similar to a
non-supersymmetyric SO(10) model for observable $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation
discussed before, suggesting that this AD scenario can be embedded into a grand
unified SO(10) model. We also find that for a low scale (all scales in the 100
TeV range), there is a narrow range of parameters where the observable
$n-\bar{n}$ oscillation is compatible with viable AD baryogenesis. A feature of
this baryogenesis scenario for $n-\bar{n}$ oscillation is that it necessarily
predicts processes with $\Delta B=4$ or higher, all be it with highly
suppressed amplitudes.

our state-of-the-art jet quenching model, which combines the
next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD framework, a linear Boltzmann transport

good description of nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ for charged

results show a clear system size dependence for both light and heavy flavor

the Gale-Shapley algorithm in real time. We show that early offers made in this

splitting the energy or altering the active number of STAR-IOS elements,
STAR-IOSs provide high flexibility of successive interference cancellation
(SIC) orders for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. Based on the
aforementioned advantages, this paper investigates a STAR-IOS-aided downlink
NOMA network with randomly deployed users. We first propose three tractable
channel models for different application scenarios, namely the central limit
model, the curve fitting model, and the M-fold convolution model. More
specifically, the central limit model fits the scenarios with large-size
STAR-IOSs while the curve fitting model is extended to evaluate multi-cell
networks. However, these two models cannot obtain accurate diversity orders.
Hence, we figure out the M-fold convolution model to derive accurate diversity
orders. We consider three protocols for STAR-IOSs, namely, the energy splitting
(ES) protocol, the time switching (TS) protocol, and the mode switching (MS)
protocol. Based on the ES protocol, we derive analytical outage probability
expressions for the paired NOMA users by the central limit model and the curve
fitting model. Based on three STAR-IOS protocols, we derive the diversity gains
of NOMA users by the M-fold convolution model. The analytical results reveal
that the diversity gain of NOMA users is equal to the active number of STAR-IOS
elements. Numerical results indicate that 1) in high signal-to-noise ratio
regions, the central limit model performs as an upper bound, while a lower
bound is obtained by the curve fitting model; 2) the TS protocol has the best
performance but requesting more time blocks than other protocols; 3) the ES
protocol outperforms the MS protocol as the ES protocol has higher diversity
gains.

the number of speakers is larger than the one observed during training. This is
because its speaker counting relies on supervised learning. In this work, we
introduce an unsupervised clustering process embedded in the attractor-based

short subsequences and then perform attractor-based diarization for each

speaker correspondence is obtained by unsupervised clustering of the vectors
computed from the attractors from all the subsequences. This makes it possible
to produce diarization results of a large number of speakers for the whole

magnetic field are produced due to the existence of differential rotation and
helicity in the plasma flows in their convection zones (CZs). Hence, it is
expected that for each star, there is a critical dynamo number for the
operation of a large-scale dynamo. As a star slows down, it is expected that
the large-scale dynamo ceases to operate above a critical rotation period. In
our study, we explore the possibility of the operation of the dynamo in the
subcritical region using the Babcock--Leighton type kinematic dynamo model. In
some parameter regimes, we find that the dynamo shows hysteresis behavior,
i.e., two dynamo solutions are possible depending on the initial parameters --
decaying solution if started with weak field and strong oscillatory solution
(subcritical dynamo) when started with a strong field. However, under large
fluctuations in the dynamo parameter, the subcritical dynamo mode is unstable
in some parameter regimes. Therefore, our study supports the possible existence
of subcritical dynamo in some stars which was previously shown in a mean-field
dynamo model with distributed $\alpha$ and MHD turbulent dynamo simulations.

shallow layers' features by combing deep layers' contextual features. However,
under the limitation of the inconsistency in gradient computation across
different layers, the shallow layers in FPN are not fully exploited to detect
tiny objects. In this paper, we propose a Scale Selection Pyramid network
(SSPNet) for tiny person detection, which consists of three components: Context
Attention Module (CAM), Scale Enhancement Module (SEM), and Scale Selection
Module (SSM). CAM takes account of context information to produce hierarchical
attention heatmaps. SEM highlights features of specific scales at different
layers, leading the detector to focus on objects of specific scales instead of
vast backgrounds. SSM exploits adjacent layers' relationships to fulfill
suitable feature sharing between deep layers and shallow layers, thereby
avoiding the inconsistency in gradient computation across different layers.
Besides, we propose a Weighted Negative Sampling (WNS) strategy to guide the
detector to select more representative samples. Experiments on the TinyPerson
benchmark show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA)

neural network based end-to-end models have dramatically improved the
performance of multi-taker overlapped ASR tasks. One promising approach for
end-to-end modeling is autoregressive modeling with serialized output training
in which transcriptions of multiple speakers are recursively generated one
after another. This enables us to naturally capture relationships between
speakers. However, the conventional modeling method cannot explicitly take into
account the speaker attributes of individual utterances such as gender and age
information. In fact, the performance deteriorates when each speaker is the
same gender or is close in age. To address this problem, we propose unified
autoregressive modeling for joint end-to-end multi-talker overlapped ASR and
speaker attribute estimation. Our key idea is to handle gender and age
estimation tasks within the unified autoregressive modeling. In the proposed
method, transformer-based autoregressive model recursively generates not only
textual tokens but also attribute tokens of each speaker. This enables us to
effectively utilize speaker attributes for improving multi-talker overlapped
ASR. Experiments on Japanese multi-talker overlapped ASR tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

utilize evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels

privacy based on worst-case analysis. Often, DP classifies most mechanisms
without external noise as non-private [Dwork et al., 2014], and external
noises, such as Gaussian noise or Laplacian noise [Dwork et al., 2006], are
introduced to improve privacy. In many real-world applications, however, adding
external noise is undesirable and sometimes prohibited. For example,
presidential elections often require a deterministic rule to be used [Liu et
al., 2020], and small noises can lead to dramatic decreases in the prediction
accuracy of deep neural networks, especially the underrepresented classes
[Bagdasaryan et al., 2019].
  In this paper, we propose a natural extension and relaxation of DP following
the worst average-case idea behind the celebrated smoothed analysis [Spielman
and Teng, 2004]. Our notion, the smoothed DP, can effectively measure the
privacy leakage of mechanisms without external noises under realistic settings.
  We prove several strong properties of the smoothed DP, including
composability, robustness to post-processing and etc. We proved that any
discrete mechanism with sampling procedures is more private than what DP
predicts. In comparison, many continuous mechanisms with sampling procedures
are still non-private under smoothed DP. Experimentally, we first verified that
the discrete sampling mechanisms are private in real-world elections. Then, we
apply the smoothed DP notion on quantized gradient descent, which indicates
some neural networks can be private without adding any extra noises. We believe
that these results contribute to the theoretical foundation of realistic
privacy measures beyond worst-case analysis.

the conventional method cannot take into account the relationships between

blue-shifted structures in the transition region tend to be brighter than the
red-shifted ones, but their nonthermal velocities have no significant

of propagation of plasma to a long distance on the projection plane. Surge-like

Existing fusion-based methods achieve remarkable performances by integrating

correspondence between 2D pixels and 3D points by projection and can only
perform the information fusion in a fixed manner, and thus their performances
cannot be easily migrated to a more realistic scenario where the collected data
often lack strict pair-wise features for prediction. To address this, we employ
a late fusion strategy where we first learn the geometric and contextual
similarities between the input and back-projected (from 2D pixels) point clouds
and utilize them to guide the fusion of two modalities to further exploit
complementary information. Specifically, we employ a geometric similarity
module (GSM) to directly compare the spatial coordinate distributions of
pair-wise 3D neighborhoods, and a contextual similarity module (CSM) to
aggregate and compare spatial contextual information of corresponding central
points. The two proposed modules can effectively measure how much image
features can help predictions, enabling the network to adaptively adjust the
contributions of two modalities to the final prediction of each point.
Experimental results on the ScanNetV2 benchmark demonstrate that SAFNet
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion-based approaches
across various data integrity.

specific experience, which limits the growth of emerging applications.
Moreover, obtaining performance limits of UAV based visual servoing is
difficult due to the complexity of the models used. In this paper, we propose a
novel noise tolerant approach for real-time identification and tuning of visual
servoing systems, based on deep neural networks (DNN) classification of system
response generated by the modified relay feedback test (MRFT). The proposed
method, called DNN with noise protected MRFT (DNN-NP-MRFT), can be used with a
multitude of vision sensors and estimation algorithms despite the high levels
of sensor's noise. Response of DNN-NP-MRFT to noise perturbations is
investigated and its effect on identification and tuning performance is
analyzed. The proposed DNN-NP-MRFT is able to detect performance changes due to
the use of high latency vision sensors, or due to the integration of inertial
measurement unit (IMU) measurements in the UAV states estimation. Experimental
identification closely matches simulation results, which can be used to explain
system behaviour and predict the closed loop performance limits for a given
hardware and software setup. We also demonstrate the ability of DNN-NP-MRFT
tuned UAVs to reject external disturbances like wind, or human push and pull.
Finally, we discuss the advantages of the proposed DNN-NP-MRFT visual servoing

disorder. An inversion methodology capable of decoding the information

recently proposed but despite claims of generality and robustness, the method
has only been used with 2D systems possessing relatively simple electronic
structures. Here we put these claims to the test and generalise the inversion
method to the case of monolayer MoS$_2$, a material whose electronic structure
is far more complex and elaborate. Starting from the spectral function that
describes the DC conductivity of a disordered sample of a single layered
MoS$_2$ containing a small concentration of randomly dispersed vacancies, we
are able to invert the signal and find the exact composition of defects with an
impressive degree of accuracy. Remarkably, equally accurate results are
obtained with the optical conductivity. This is indicative of a methodology
that is indeed suitable to extract composition information from different 2D
materials, regardless of their electronic structure complexity. Calculated
conductivity results were used as a proxy for their experimental counterpart
and were obtained with an efficient quantum transport code (KITE) based on a

studies modeled such systems as coupled gravity currents (GCs) consisting of
one fluid that lubricates the flow of another fluid, and having two propagating
fronts. When both fluid are Newtonian and discharged at constant flux, global
similarity solutions were found. However, when the top fluid is strain-rate
softening experiments have shown that each fluid front evolved with a different
exponent. Here we explore theoretically and numerically such lubricated GCs in
a model that describes the axisymmetric spreading of a power-law fluid on top
of a Newtonian fluid, where the discharge of both fluids is power law in time.
We find that the model admits similarity solutions only in specific cases,
including the purely Newtonian case, for a certain discharge exponent, at
asymptotic limits of the fluids viscosity ratio, and at the vicinity of the
fluid fronts. Generally, each fluid front has a power-law time evolution with a
similar exponent as a non-lubricated GC of the corresponding fluid, and
intercepts that depend on both fluid properties. Consequently, we identify two
mechanisms by which the inner lubricating fluid front outstrips the outer fluid
front. Many aspects of our theory are found consistent with recent laboratory
experiments. Discrepancies suggest that hydrofracturing or wall slip may be
important near the fronts. This theory may help to understand the dynamics of

systems of linked computer models. This transformation permits an efficient DGP
training procedure that only involves optimizations of conventional GPs. In
addition, predictions from DGP emulators can be made in a fast and analytically
tractable manner by naturally utilizing the closed form predictive means and
variances of linked GP emulators. We demonstrate the method in a series of
synthetic examples and empirical applications, and show that it is a
competitive candidate for DGP surrogate inference, combining efficiency that is
comparable to doubly stochastic variational inference and uncertainty
quantification that is comparable to the fully-Bayesian approach. A
$\texttt{Python}$ package $\texttt{dgpsi}$ implementing the method is also
produced and available at https://github.com/mingdeyu/DGP.

essential features, criteria, and software quality characteristics that are
necessary for CSA education apps, and determined their effectiveness for
potential use as CSA education programs for children. The internal consistency

are also calculated. User comments from the app stores are collected and
analyzed to understand their expectations and views. After analyzing the
feasibility of reviewed apps, CSA app design considerations are proposed that
highlight game-based teaching approaches. Evaluation results showed that most
of the reviewed apps are not suitable for being used as CSA education programs.
While a few may be able to teach children and parents individually, only the
apps ""Child Abuse Prevention"" (rate 3.89 out of 5) and ""Orbit Rescue"" (rate

the opinions of their customers to improve their products and to determine

have received significant attention. These methods mitigate the domain gap
between different applications by training cross-domain generalizable
classifiers which help to relax the need for data annotation for each domain.
Most existing methods focus on learning domain-agnostic representations that
are invariant with respect to both the source and the target domains. As a
result, a classifier that is trained using the source domain annotated data
would generalize well in a related target domain. We introduce a new domain
adaptation method which induces large margins between different classes in an
embedding space. This embedding space is trained to be domain-agnostic by
matching the data distributions across the domains. Large intraclass margins in
the source domain help to reduce the effect of ""domain shift"" on the classifier

To date, numerous design studies have been conducted and over a dozen science
missions have own to study the magnetosphere. However, a majority of these
solutions relied on large monolithic satellites, which limited the spatial
resolution of these investigations, as did the technological limitations of the
past. To counter these limitations, we propose the use of a satellite swarm
carrying numerous and distributed payloads for magnetospheric measurements. Our
mission is named APIS (Applications and Potentials of Intelligent Swarms),
which aims to characterize fundamental plasma processes in the Earth's
magnetosphere and measure the effect of the solar wind on our magnetosphere. We
propose a swarm of 40 CubeSats in two highly-elliptical orbits around the
Earth, which perform radio tomography in the magnetotail at 8-12 Earth Radii
(RE) downstream, and the subsolar magnetosphere at 8-12RE upstream. In
addition, in-situ measurements of the magnetic and electric fields, plasma
density will be performed by on-board instruments.
  In this article, we present an outline of previous missions and designs for
magnetospheric studies, along with the science drivers and motivation for the
APIS mission. Furthermore, preliminary design results are included to show the
feasibility of such a mission. The science requirements drive the APIS mission
design, the mission operation and the system requirements. In addition to the
various science payloads, critical subsystems of the satellites are
investigated e.g., navigation, communication, processing and power systems. We
summarize our findings, along with the potential next steps to strengthen our

therefore, in quantum field theory, summation over the momentum eigenvalues
will replace integration over the momentum. In the Einstein--Cartan theory of
gravity, in which torsion is coupled to spin, the separation between the
eigenvalues increases with the magnitude of the momentum. Consequently, this
replacement regularizes divergent integrals in Feynman diagrams with loops by
turning them into convergent sums. In this article, we apply torsional
regularization to the self-energy of a charged lepton in quantum
electrodynamics. We show that this procedure eliminates the ultraviolet
divergence. We also show that torsion gives a photon a small nonzero mass,
which regularizes the infrared divergence. In the end, we calculate the finite
bare masses of the electron, muon, and tau lepton: $0.4329\,\mbox{MeV}$,
$90.95\,\mbox{MeV}$, and $1543\,\mbox{MeV}$, respectively. These values
constitute about $85\%$ of the observed, re-normalized masses.

underlying assumption that all data points are equally relevant to the
prediction of effort for future projects. The dynamic nature of several aspects
of the software engineering process could mean that this assumption does not
hold in at least some cases. This study employs three kernel estimator
functions to test the stationarity assumption in five software engineering
datasets that have been used in the construction of software effort estimation
models. The kernel estimators are used in the generation of nonuniform weights
which are subsequently employed in weighted linear regression modeling. In each
model, older projects are assigned smaller weights while the more recently
completed projects are assigned larger weights, to reflect their potentially
greater relevance to present or future projects that need to be estimated.
Prediction errors are compared to those obtained from uniform models. Our
results indicate that, for the datasets that exhibit underlying nonstationary
processes, uniform models are more accurate than the nonuniform models; that
is, models based on kernel estimator functions are worse than the models where
no weighting was applied. In contrast, the accuracies of uniform and nonuniform
models for datasets that exhibited stationary processes were essentially
equivalent. Our analysis indicates that as the heterogeneity of a dataset
increases, the effect of stationarity is overridden. The results of our study
also confirm prior findings that the accuracy of effort estimation models is
independent of the type of kernel estimator function used in model development.

Consequently, Riemann's quartic length expression can be interpreted as a

present various examples of Riemann's quartic that demonstrate that Finsler's
geometry is too restrictive even in the case of a positive definite Euclidean

looked at the implications of rounding continuous random variables, rounding
may be applied to functions of discrete random variables as well. For example,
to infer on suicide excess deaths after a national emergency, authorities may
provide a rounded average of deaths before and after the emergency started.
Suicide rates tend to be relatively low around the world and such rounding may
seriously affect inference on the change of suicide rate. In this paper, we
study the scenario when a rounded to nearest integer average is used as a proxy
for a non-negative discrete random variable. Specifically, our interest is in
drawing inference on a parameter from the pmf of Y , when we get U = n[Y /n] as
a proxy for Y . The probability generating function of U , E(U ), and Var(U )
capture the effect of the coarsening of the support of Y . Also, moments and
estimators of distribution parameters are explored for some special cases. We
show that under certain conditions, there is little impact from rounding.
However, we also find scenarios where rounding can significantly affect
statistical inference as demonstrated in three examples. The simple methods we
propose are able to partially counter rounding error effects. While for some
probability distributions it may be difficult to derive maximum likelihood
estimators as a function of U , we provide a framework to obtain an estimator
numerically.

elasticity of demand for live events varies before, on the day of, and after

high-dimensional confounders whose relationships with treatment policy (i.e.,

Forest framework for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. We find
significant temporal dynamics in the price elasticity of demand over the entire

to the livestreaming day, turning to inelastic on that day. Over the
post-livestream period, the demand for the recorded version is still sensitive
to price, but much less than in the pre-livestream period. We further show that
this temporal variation in price elasticity is driven by the quality
uncertainty inherent in such events and the opportunity of real-time

and powerful window of observation that offers us the possibility to map the
spatial distribution of cosmic HI and learn about cosmology. BINGO (Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations [BAO] from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) is a new
unique radio telescope designed to be one of the first to probe BAO at radio
frequencies. BINGO has two science goals: cosmology and astrophysics. Cosmology
is the main science goal and the driver for BINGO's design and strategy. The
key of BINGO is to detect the low redshift BAO to put strong constraints in the
dark sector models. Given the versatility of the BINGO telescope, a secondary
goal is astrophysics, where BINGO can help discover and study Fast Radio Bursts
(FRB) and other transients, Galactic and extragalactic science. In this paper,
we introduce the latest progress of the BINGO project, its science goals,
describing the scientific potential of the project in each science and the new
developments obtained by the collaboration. We introduce the BINGO project and
its science goals and give a general summary of recent developments in
construction, science potential and pipeline development obtained by the BINGO
collaboration in the past few years. We show that BINGO will be able to obtain
competitive constraints for the dark sector, and also that will allow for the
discovery of several FRBs in the southern hemisphere. The capacity of BINGO in
obtaining information from 21-cm is also tested in the pipeline introduced
here. There is still no measurement of the BAO in radio, and studying cosmology
in this new window of observations is one of the most promising advances in the
field. The BINGO project is a radio telescope that has the goal to be one of
the first to perform this measurement and it is currently being built in the
northeast of Brazil. (Abridged)

neutral hydrogen (HI signal) in different redshifts is an important tool for
modern cosmology. However, detecting this faint signal with non-cryogenic
receivers in single-dish telescopes is a challenging task. The BINGO (Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) radio telescope
is an instrument designed to detect baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in
the cosmological HI signal, in the redshift interval $0.127 \le z \le 0.449$.
This paper describes the BINGO radio telescope, including the current status of
the optics, receiver, observational strategy, calibration, and the site. BINGO
has been carefully designed to minimize systematics, being a transit instrument
with no moving dishes and 28 horns operating in the frequency range $980 \le
\nu \le 1260$ MHz. Comprehensive laboratory tests were conducted for many of
the BINGO subsystems and the prototypes of the receiver chain, horn, polarizer,
magic tees, and transitions have been successfully tested between 2018 - 2020.
The survey was designed to cover $\sim 13\%$ of the sky, with the primary
mirror pointing at declination $\delta=-15^{\circ}$. The telescope will see an
instantaneous declination strip of $14.75^{\circ}$. The results of the
prototype tests closely meet those obtained during the modeling process,
suggesting BINGO will perform according to our expectations. After one year of
observations with a $60\%$ duty cycle and 28 horns, BINGO should achieve an
expected sensitivity of 102 $\mu K$ per 9.33 MHz frequency channel, one
polarization, and be able to measure the HI power spectrum in a competitive
time frame.

radiation arising from the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen and aims to
measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from such fluctuations,
therefore serving as a pathfinder to future deeper intensity mapping surveys.
The requirements for the Phase 1 of the projects consider a large reflector
system (two 40 m-class dishes in a crossed-Dragone configuration), illuminating
a focal plane with 28 horns to measure the sky with two circular polarisations
in a drift scan mode to produce measurements of the radiation in intensity as
well as the circular polarisation. In this paper we present the optical design
for the instrument. We describe the intensity and polarisation properties of
the beams and the optical arrangement of the horns in the focal plane to
produce a homogeneous and well-sampled map after the end of Phase 1. Our
analysis provides an optimal model for the location of the horns in the focal
plane, producing a homogeneous and Nyquist sampled map after the nominal survey
time. We arrive at an optimal configuration for the optical system, including
the focal plane positioning and the beam behavior of the instrument. We present
an estimate of the expected side lobes both for intensity and polarisation, as
well as the effect of band averaging on the final side lobes. The cross
polarisation leakage values for the final configuration allow us to conclude
that the optical arrangement meets the requirements of the project. We conclude
that the chosen optical design meets the requirements for the project in terms
of polarisation purity, area coverage as well as homogeneity of coverage so
that BINGO can perform a successful BAO experiment. We further conclude that
the requirements on the placement and r.m.s. error on the mirrors are also
achievable so that a successful experiment can be conducted.(Abridged)

redshifted 21cm line intensity mapping constitutes a powerful probe for
cosmology. However, the redshifted 21cm signal is obscured by the foreground
emission from our Galaxy and other extragalactic foregrounds. This paper
addresses the capabilities of the BINGO survey to separate such signals.
Specifically, this paper looks in detail at the different residuals left over
by foreground components, shows that a noise-corrected spectrum is unbiased,
and shows that we understand the remaining systematic residuals by analyzing
nonzero contributions to the three-point function. We use the generalized
needlet internal linear combination, which we apply to sky simulations of the
BINGO experiment for each redshift bin of the survey. We present our recovery
of the redshifted 21cm signal from sky simulations of the BINGO experiment,
including foreground components. We test the recovery of the 21cm signal
through the angular power spectrum at different redshifts, as well as the
recovery of its non-Gaussian distribution through a bispectrum analysis. We
find that non-Gaussianities from the original foreground maps can be removed
down to, at least, the noise limit of the BINGO survey with such techniques.
Our component separation methodology allows us to subtract the foreground
contamination in the BINGO channels down to levels below the cosmological
signal and the noise, and to reconstruct the 21cm power spectrum for different
redshift bins without significant loss at multipoles $20 \lesssim \ell \lesssim
500$. Our bispectrum analysis yields strong tests of the level of the residual
foreground contamination in the recovered 21cm signal, thereby allowing us to
both optimize and validate our component separation analysis. (Abridged)

of the structure and evolution of the Universe. It provides complementary data
to the current large-scale structure observations with different systematics,
and thus it will be used to improve our understanding of the $\Lambda$CDM
model. Among several radio cosmological surveys designed to measure this line,
BINGO is a single-dish telescope mainly designed to detect baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAOs) at low redshifts ($0.127< z<0.449$). Our goal is to assess
the fiducial BINGO setup and its capabilities of constraining the cosmological
parameters, and to analyze the effect of different instrument configurations.
We used the Phase 1 fiducial configuration of the BINGO telescope to perform
our cosmological forecasts. In addition, we investigated the impact of several
instrumental setups, taking into account some instrumental systematics, and
different cosmological models. Combining BINGO with Planck temperature and
polarization data, the projected constraint improves from a $13\%$ and $25\%$
precision measurement at the $68\%$ confidence level with Planck only to $1\%$
and $3\%$ for the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state (EoS),
respectively, within the wCDM model. Assuming a Chevallier-Polarski-Linder
parameterization, the EoS parameters have standard deviations given by
$\sigma_{w_0} = 0.30$ and $\sigma_{w_a} = 1.2$, which are improvements on the
order of $30\%$ with respect to Planck alone. Also, we can access information
about the HI density and bias, obtaining $\sim 8.5\%$ and $\sim 6\%$ precision,
respectively, assuming they vary with redshift at three independent bins. The
fiducial BINGO configuration will be able to extract significant cosmological
information from the HI distribution and provide constraints competitive with
current and future cosmological surveys. (Abridged)

infrastructures to provide cloud-based database services as cost effective,
efficient and scalable solutions to store and process large volume of data.
Hence, NoSQL databases became more and more popular because of their inherent
features of better performance and high scalability compared to other
relational databases. However, with this deployment architecture where the
information is stored in a public cloud, protection against the sensitive data
is still being a major concern. Since the data owner does not have the full
control over his sensitive data in a cloud-based database solution, many
organizations are reluctant to move forward with Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)
solutions. Some of the recent work addressed this issue by introducing
additional layers to provide encryption mechanisms to encrypt data, however,
these approaches are more application specific and they need to be properly
evaluated to ensure whether they can achieve high performance with the
scalability when it comes to large volume of data in a cloud-based production
environment. This paper proposes a practical system design and implementation
to provide Security-as-a-Service for NoSQL databases (SEC-NoSQL) while
supporting the execution of query over encrypted data with guaranteed level of
system performance. Several different models of implementations are proposed,
and their performance is evaluated using YCSB benchmark considering large

design fits well on encrypted data while maintaining the high performance and
scalability. Moreover, to deploy our solution as a cloud-based service, a
practical guide establishing Service Level Agreement (SLA) is also included.

found that three models developed in this paper can describe anisotropic
neutron stars ranging from low density to high density. Finally, we obtain a
quadratic Equation of State for each model describing various neutron stars,
which can be utilized to find compositions of the stellar structures. It is
very useful to find models that can exhibit quadratic EOS, since material
compositions of real neutron stars and strange stars are found to exhibit

We investigate for the first time the effects on the weak and strong

surmised to be related to the topology of the temporal network featured by the

directly from the topological information of the temporal network remains a
challenge. Here, using data from a diverse set of real-world complex systems,
we develop the `entropy of temporal entanglement' as a novel and insightful

this parameter-free quantity naturally allows for topological comparisons

different types of stochastic dynamical processes playing out on top of

serves as a quantitative embodiment of the systems' spreading vulnerability,
irrespective of the details of the processes. In being able to do so, i.e., in
being able to quantitatively extract a complex system's proneness to facilitate

Attribute-aware Fashion Recommender (AFRec). Specifically, AFRec recommender
assesses the outfit compatibility by explicitly leveraging the extracted

Extensive experiments have demonstrated that, by making full use of the

singleton of the standard value function which solves the master equation. The
set value is by nature unique, and we shall establish two crucial properties:
(i) the dynamic programming principle, also called time consistency; and (ii)
the convergence of the set values of the corresponding $N$-player games, which

first work in the literature which studies the dynamic value of mean field
games without requiring the uniqueness of mean field equilibria. We emphasize

developments will strongly depend on the progress of national and global
vaccination programs, the emergence and spread of variants of concern, and
public responses to nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). In the short term,
many people are still unvaccinated, VOCs continue to emerge and spread, and
mobility and population mixing is expected to increase over the summer.
Therefore, policies that lift restrictions too much and too early risk another
damaging wave. This challenge remains despite the reduced opportunities for
transmission due to vaccination progress and reduced indoor mixing in the
summer. In autumn 2021, increased indoor activity might accelerate the spread
again, but a necessary reintroduction of NPIs might be too slow. The incidence
may strongly rise again, possibly filling intensive care units, if vaccination
levels are not high enough. A moderate, adaptive level of NPIs will thus remain
necessary. These epidemiological aspects are put into perspective with the
economic, social, and health-related consequences and thereby provide a
holistic perspective on the future of COVID-19.

equations are applied to compute the incremental drift velocity and the change
in the elliptic flow of particles from the four sources of the electric force,
which are of coulomb (EC), Lorentz (EL), Faraday (EF) and Plasma-based. We find
out that the field evolution arouses flow at lower transverse momentum and
suppresses it at higher. Heavier particles get higher initial push, and
particles and their anti-particles get crudely the same elliptic flow changes.
Moreover, elliptic flow is found to show different percentage increase for
different collision energies. To conclude, the present study shows that besides
the inclusion of electromagnetic fields, the increase in collision energy
affects the elliptic flow of particles in a non-uniform fashion throughout the

keeping the functionality of parameters is needed to establish a better

learning tasks across multiple edge users by periodically aggregating trained
local parameters. To address key challenges of enabling FL over a wireless
fog-cloud system (e.g., non-i.i.d. data, users' heterogeneity), we first
propose an efficient FL algorithm based on Federated Averaging (called FedFog)
to perform the local aggregation of gradient parameters at fog servers and
global training update at the cloud. Next, we employ FedFog in wireless
fog-cloud systems by investigating a novel network-aware FL optimization
problem that strikes the balance between the global loss and completion time.
An iterative algorithm is then developed to obtain a precise measurement of the
system performance, which helps design an efficient stopping criteria to output
an appropriate number of global rounds. To mitigate the straggler effect, we
propose a flexible user aggregation strategy that trains fast users first to
obtain a certain level of accuracy before allowing slow users to join the
global training updates. Extensive numerical results using several real-world
FL tasks are provided to verify the theoretical convergence of FedFog. We also
show that the proposed co-design of FL and communication is essential to

mechanism behind the BBB penetrating behaviors. To address this limitation, we
employed the relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) to handle the

out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by assigning higher likelihoods to anomalous
data. Energy-based models (EBMs) are flexible, unnormalized density models
which seem to be able to improve upon this failure mode. In this work, we
provide an extensive study investigating OOD detection with EBMs trained with
different approaches on tabular and image data and find that EBMs do not
provide consistent advantages. We hypothesize that EBMs do not learn semantic
features despite their discriminative structure similar to Normalizing Flows.
To verify this hypotheses, we show that supervision and architectural
restrictions improve the OOD detection of EBMs independent of the training
approach.

Part I. Two models, with and without co-optimization are confronted. The
modeling of reserve and the incentive to renewable as well as the calibration
of the model are inspired by the Spanish market. A sensitivity analysis is
performed on configurations that differ by generation capacity, ramping
capability, and market parameters (available wind, Feed in Premium to wind,
generators risk aversion, and reserve requirement). The models and the case
study are purely illustrative but the methodology is general.

  Review","ACM COMPASS 2021",,,,"cs.LG stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conservation science depends on an accurate understanding of what's happening
in a given ecosystem. How many species live there? What is the makeup of the
population? How is that changing over time? Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)
seeks to predict the spatial (and sometimes temporal) patterns of species
occurrence, i.e. where a species is likely to be found. The last few years have
seen a surge of interest in applying powerful machine learning tools to
challenging problems in ecology. Despite its considerable importance, SDM has
received relatively little attention from the computer science community. Our
goal in this work is to provide computer scientists with the necessary
background to read the SDM literature and develop ecologically useful ML-based
SDM algorithms. In particular, we introduce key SDM concepts and terminology,
review standard models, discuss data availability, and highlight technical
challenges and pitfalls.

  Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM) 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fake News on social media platforms has attracted a lot of attention in
recent times, primarily for events related to politics (2016 US Presidential
elections), healthcare (infodemic during COVID-19), to name a few. Various
methods have been proposed for detecting Fake News. The approaches span from
exploiting techniques related to network analysis, Natural Language Processing
(NLP), and the usage of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose
DEAP-FAKED, a knowleDgE grAPh FAKe nEws Detection framework for identifying
Fake News. Our approach is a combination of the NLP -- where we encode the news
content, and the GNN technique -- where we encode the Knowledge Graph (KG). A
variety of these encodings provides a complementary advantage to our detector.
We evaluate our framework using two publicly available datasets containing
articles from domains such as politics, business, technology, and healthcare.
As part of dataset pre-processing, we also remove the bias, such as the source
of the articles, which could impact the performance of the models. DEAP-FAKED
obtains an F1-score of 88% and 78% for the two datasets, which is an
improvement of 21%, and 3% respectively, which shows the effectiveness of the
approach.

efficiently adapt to the data variations in the streaming environment. However,
when the hash functions are updated, the binary codes for the whole database
have to be updated to be consistent with the hash functions, resulting in the
inefficiency in the online image retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a
novel online hashing framework without updating binary codes. In the proposed
framework, the hash functions are fixed and a parametric similarity function
for the binary codes is learnt online to adapt to the streaming data.
Specifically, a parametric similarity function that has a bilinear form is
adopted and a metric learning algorithm is proposed to learn the similarity
function online based on the characteristics of the hashing methods. The
experiments on two multi-label image datasets show that our method is
competitive or outperforms the state-of-the-art online hashing methods in terms
of both accuracy and efficiency for multi-label image retrieval.

achieved prominent performance. However, in real application scenarios, users
always write multiple Chinese characters to form one complete sentence and the
contextual information within these characters holds the significant potential
to improve the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of sentence-level OLHCCR. In
this work, we first propose a simple and straightforward end-to-end network,
namely vanilla compositional network~(VCN) to tackle the sentence-level OLHCCR.
It couples convolutional neural network with sequence modeling architecture to
exploit the handwritten character's previous contextual information. Although
VCN performs much better than the state-of-the-art single OLHCCR model, it
exposes high fragility when confronting with not well written characters such
as sloppy writing, missing or broken strokes. To improve the robustness of
sentence-level OLHCCR, we further propose a novel deep spatial-temporal fusion
network~(DSTFN). It utilizes a pre-trained autoregresssive framework as the
backbone component, which projects each Chinese character into word embeddings,
and integrates the spatial glyph features of handwritten characters and their
contextual information multiple times at multi-layer fusion module. We also
construct a large-scale sentence-level handwriting dataset, named as CSOHD to
evaluate models. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that DSTFN achieves
the state-of-the-art performance, which presents strong robustness compared
with VCN and exiting single OLHCCR models. The in-depth empirical analysis and
case studies indicate that DSTFN can significantly improve the efficiency of
handwriting input, with the handwritten Chinese character with incomplete
strokes being recognized precisely.
