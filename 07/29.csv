Hove singularity of the electronic spectrum crosses the Fermi energy, is
expected to cause a change in the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity from its Fermi liquid behavior $\rho\sim T^{2}$ to $\rho\sim
T^{2}{\rm log}\left(1/T\right)$, a behavior consistent with experiments by
Barber et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 076601 (2018)]. This expectation
originates from the same multi-band scattering processes with large momentum
transfer that were recently shown to account for the linear in $T$ resistivity
of the strange metal Sr$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$. In contrast, the thermal
resistivity $\rho_{Q}\equiv T/\kappa$, where $\kappa$ is the thermal
conductivity, is governed by qualitatively distinct processes that involve a
broad continuum of compressive modes, i.e. long wavelength density excitations
in Van Hove systems. While these compressive modes do not affect the charge
current, they couple to thermal transport and yield $\rho_{Q}\propto T^{3/2}$.
As a result, we predict that the Wiedemann-Franz law in strained
Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ should be violated with a Lorenz ratio $L\propto T^{1/2}{\rm
log}\left(1/T\right)$. We expect this effect to be observable in the
temperature and strain regime where the anomalous charge transport was
established.

the magnetic sample and thus be utilized to enhance the MOKE signal of samples
separated from the plasmonic device. We have achieved this by using air as low
index dielectric where the evanescent wave extends, preceding to excitation of
surface plasmons. The magnetic sample under consideration is a thin layer of
cobalt coated by an ultrathin silver layer, on a silicon substrate (Ag/Co/Si).
The sample is brought close enough to the prism//Air interface, allowing
surface plasmon excitation in the air/Ag interface. This leads to an increase
of the TMOKE signal up to ~ 2 per mil with respect to the incident light. This
is about 8 times the traditional MOKE signal in the absence of plasmons. This
is comparable with previous works using the Kretschmann-Raether configuration.
This should find applications in MOKE-related technology by increasing its
sensitivity to about one order of magnitude and allowing the magnetic sample to

After a general presentation in Chapter 2, the properties of heavy-fermion
paramagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferromagnets are considered in Chapters 3,
4, and 5, respectively. Chapters 6 and 7 are dedicated to two specific
compounds, URu$_2$Si$_2$ for which a 'hidden-order' phase constitutes a
more-than-thirty-years-old unsolved mystery, and UTe$_2$, where multiple
superconducting phases have been discovered in the last two years. Experiments
performed using a panel of techniques ranging from microscopic (neutron
scattering, NMR, etc.) to thermodynamic (specific heat, magnetization, etc.)
and transport (electrical resistivity, etc.) probes, under extreme conditions
of low temperatures, intense magnetic fields and high pressures, are reviewed.
They show that magnetism plays a central role in the quantum critical
properties of heavy-fermion systems. An emphasis is given to the intersite
magnetic fluctuations, presented as the driving force for a heavy Fermi liquid,
precursor of quantum magnetic criticality ending in magnetically-ordered
phases. They are also suspected to drive an unconventional mechanism for
superconductivity, which develops in the vicinity of quantum magnetic phase
transitions induced under pressure or magnetic field. The appearance of
magnetic fluctuations and ultimately magnetic order in heavy-fermion compounds
occurs in a nearly-integer-valence regime, in which $f$ electrons have a dual
itinerant-localized character. Fermi-surface and valence studies, which give
complementary information about this duality, are also considered.

  The chief innovation is the introduction of limit objects for $n$-queens

prespecified queenon and whose entropy matches that found in the upper bound.
The enumeration of $n$-queens configurations is then obtained by maximizing the

automated, pairwise surface registration pipeline used to establish dense
correspondence among 3D breast scans is introduced. Our method is
computationally efficient and requires only four landmarks to guide the
registration process. A major challenge when modeling female breasts from
surface-only 3D breast scans is the non-separability of breast and thorax. In
order to weaken the strong coupling between breast and surrounding areas, we
propose to minimize the variance outside the breast region as much as possible.
To achieve this goal, a novel concept called breast probability masks (BPMs) is
introduced. A BPM assigns probabilities to each point of a 3D breast scan,
telling how likely it is that a particular point belongs to the breast area.
During registration, we use BPMs to align the template to the target as
accurately as possible inside the breast region and only roughly outside. This
simple yet effective strategy significantly reduces the unwanted variance
outside the breast region, leading to better statistical shape models in which
breast shapes are quite well decoupled from the thorax. The RBSM is thus able
to produce a variety of different breast shapes as independently as possible
from the shape of the thorax. Our systematic experimental evaluation reveals a
generalization ability of 0.17 mm and a specificity of 2.8 mm. To underline the
expressiveness of the proposed model, we finally demonstrate in two showcase
applications how the RBSM can be used for surgical outcome simulation and the
prediction of a missing breast from the remaining one. Our model is available

applications. However, the results are not always clinically acceptable and
require tedious manual revision. Here, we present a novel concept called
artificial intelligence assisted contour revision (AIACR) and demonstrate its
feasibility. The proposed clinical workflow of AIACR is as follows given an
initial contour that requires a clinicians revision, the clinician indicates
where a large revision is needed, and a trained deep learning (DL) model takes
this input to update the contour. This process repeats until a clinically
acceptable contour is achieved. The DL model is designed to minimize the
clinicians input at each iteration and to minimize the number of iterations
needed to reach acceptance. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated the
concept on 2D axial images of three head-and-neck cancer datasets, with the
clinicians input at each iteration being one mouse click on the desired
location of the contour segment. The performance of the model is quantified
with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile of Hausdorff
Distance (HD95). The average DSC/HD95 (mm) of the auto-generated initial
contours were 0.82/4.3, 0.73/5.6 and 0.67/11.4 for three datasets, which were
improved to 0.91/2.1, 0.86/2.4 and 0.86/4.7 with three mouse clicks,

grows exponentially with the number of qubits, evaluating the performance of a
quantum gate is a challenging task. Recently, a scheme called quantum gate
verification (QGV) has been proposed, which can verifies quantum gates with
near-optimal efficiency. In this paper, we implement a proof-of-principle
optical experiment to demonstrate this QGV scheme. We show that for a
single-qubit quantum gate, only $\sim300$ samples are needed to confirm the
fidelity of the quantum gate to be at least $97\%$ with a $99\%$ confidence
level using the QGV method, whereas, at least $\sim3000$ samples are needed to
achieve the same result using the standard quantum process tomography method.
The QGV method validated by this paper has the potential to be widely used for
the evaluation of quantum devices in various quantum information applications.

the data scalability issue, while the existing works usually focus on
classifying independently discrete labels. However, in many tasks (e.g.,
medical diagnosis), the labels are discrete and successively distributed. The
UDA for ordinal classification requires inducing non-trivial ordinal
distribution prior to the latent space. Target for this, the partially ordered
set (poset) is defined for constraining the latent vector. Instead of the
typically i.i.d. Gaussian latent prior, in this work, a recursively conditional
Gaussian (RCG) set is adapted for ordered constraint modeling, which admits a
tractable joint distribution prior. Furthermore, we are able to control the
density of content vector that violates the poset constraints by a simple
""three-sigma rule"". We explicitly disentangle the cross-domain images into a
shared ordinal prior induced ordinal content space and two separate
source/target ordinal-unrelated spaces, and the self-training is worked on the
shared space exclusively for ordinal-aware domain alignment. Extensive
experiments on UDA medical diagnoses and facial age estimation demonstrate its
effectiveness.

advantage in the near term, and a number of different approaches have been
proposed. In this work, we recognize that many state-of-the-art error
mitigation methods share a common feature: they are data-driven, employing
classical data obtained from runs of different quantum circuits. For example,
Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) uses variable noise data and Clifford-data
regression (CDR) uses data from near-Clifford circuits. We show that Virtual
Distillation (VD) can be viewed in a similar manner by considering classical
data produced from different numbers of state preparations. Observing this fact
allows us to unify these three methods under a general data-driven error
mitigation framework that we call UNIfied Technique for Error mitigation with
Data (UNITED). In certain situations, we find that our UNITED method can
outperform the individual methods (i.e., the whole is better than the
individual parts). Specifically, we employ a realistic noise model obtained
from a trapped ion quantum computer to benchmark UNITED, as well as other
state-of-the-art methods, in mitigating observables produced from random
quantum circuits and the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) applied to
Max-Cut problems with various numbers of qubits, circuit depths and total
numbers of shots. We find that the performance of different techniques depends
strongly on shot budgets, with more powerful methods requiring more shots for
optimal performance. For our largest considered shot budget ($10^{10}$), we
find that UNITED gives the most accurate mitigation. Hence, our work represents
a benchmarking of current error mitigation methods and provides a guide for the
regimes when certain methods are most useful.

good results in a wide variety of recommendation tasks. The introduction of
ANNs within the recommendation ecosystem has been recently questioned, raising
several comparisons in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. One aspect most
of these comparisons have in common is their focus on accuracy, neglecting
other evaluation dimensions important for the recommendation, such as novelty,
diversity, or accounting for biases. We replicate experiments from three papers

shows that the experiments are entirely reproducible, and we extend the study

investigated the Diversity and Novelty of the recommendations, showing that MF
provides a better accuracy also on the long tail, although NCF provides a
better item coverage and more diversified recommendations. We discuss the bias
effect generated by the tested methods. They show a relatively small bias, but
other recommendation baselines, with competitive accuracy performance,
consistently show to be less affected by this issue. This is the first work, to
the best of our knowledge, where several evaluation dimensions have been

detailed spatial structure of social capital varies in lower- and higher-income

capital measured on social networks is spatially more concentrated for
residents of lower-income neighborhoods than for residents of higher-income
neighborhoods. We map the micro-geography of individual online social
connections in the 50 largest metropolitan areas of the US using a large-scale
geolocalized Twitter dataset. We then analyze the spatial dimension of
individual social capital by the share of friends, closure, and share of
supported ties within circles of short distance radiuses (1, 5, and 10~km)
around users' home location. We compare residents from below-median income
neighborhoods with above-median income neighborhoods, and find that users
living in relatively poorer neighborhoods have a significantly higher share of
connections in close proximity. Moreover, their network is more cohesive and
supported within a short distance from their home. These patterns prevail
across the 50 largest US metropolitan areas with only a few exceptions. The
found disparities in the micro-geographic concentration of social capital can
feed segregation and income inequality within cities harming social circles of

recently proposed freeze-out mechanism with catalyzed annihilation. In our
setup, a vector DM field $X_\mu$ and a catalyst field $C_\mu$ is unified by an
SU(2)$_D$ gauge symmetry. These gauge fields acquire their masses via
spontaneously symmetry breaking triggered by a doublet and a real triplet
scalar fields. The catalyst particle is automatically lighter than the DM since
it only acquires mass from the vacuum expectation value of the doublet scalar.
We also introduce a dimension-5 operator to generate a kinetic mixing term
between $C_\mu$ and the U(1)$_Y$ gauge field $B_\mu$. This mixing term is
naturally small due to a suppression with a high UV completion scale, and thus
it allows the catalyst to decay after the DM freeze-out. We derive the
annihilation cross sections of processes $X^\ast+X\to 2C$ and $3C\to X^\ast+X$
and solve the Boltzmann equations for both the DM and the catalyst. We develop
the analytical approximate solutions of the equations and find them matching
the numerical solutions well. Constraints from relic abundance and indirect
detection of DM are considered. We find that the DM with a mass
$m_X\gtrsim4.5$~TeV survives in the case of a long-living catalyst. On the
other hand, if the catalyst decays during the catalyzed annihilation era, then
the bound can be released. We also discuss two paradigms which can maintain the
kinetic equilibrium of DM until the DM freeze-out. In both cases, the
freeze-out temperature of DM is an order of magnitude higher than the original
model.

changes (quenching) on the recent star formation history of galaxies. Building
upon the results obtained from a former study based on 80.000 SDSS single-fibre
measurements, we now focus on spatially-resolved (on kpc scales) galaxies,
comparing with a sample of 637 nearby objects observed by the CALIFA survey. In
general, galaxies cannot be characterised in terms of a single `evolutionary
stage'. Individual regions within galaxies arrange along a relatively narrow
ageing sequence, with some intrinsic scatter possibly due to their different
evolutionary paths. These sequences, though, differ from one galaxy to another,
although they are broadly consistent with the overall distribution found for
the (central) SDSS spectra. We find evidence of recent quenching episodes
(relatively blue colours and strong H$\alpha$ absorption) in a small fraction
of galaxies (most notably, low-mass ellipticals), on global scales and
individual regions (particularly at high metallicity). However, we argue that
most of the systems, over their entire extent, are compatible with a secular
inside-out scenario, where the evolutionary stage correlates with both global
(mass, morphology, and environment) as well as local (surface brightness and

transport sector, novel bio-hybrid liquid fuels from renewable energy and
carbon sources can be a major form of energy for future propulsion systems due
to their high energy density. A fundamental understanding of the spray and
mixing performance of the new fuel candidates in combustion systems is
necessary to design and develop the fuels for advanced combustion concepts. In
the fuel design process, a large number of candidates is required to be
screened to arrive at potential fuels for further detailed investigations. For
such a screening process, three-dimensional (3D) simulation models are
computationally too expensive and hence unfeasible. Therefore, in this paper,
we present a fast, reduced-order model (ROM) for inert sprays. The model is
based on the cross-sectionally averaged spray (CAS) model derived by Wan (1997)
from 3D multiphase equations. The original model was first tested against a
wide range of conditions and different fuels. The discrepancies between the CAS
model and experimental data are addressed by integrating state-of-the-art
breakup and evaporation models. A transport equation for vapor mass fraction is
proposed, which is important for evaporation modeling. Furthermore, the model
is extended to consider polydisperse droplets by modeling the droplet size
distribution by commonly used presumed probability density functions, such as
Rosin-Rammler, lognormal, and gamma distributions. The improved CAS model is
capable of predicting trends in the macroscopic spray characteristics for a
wide range of conditions and fuels. The computational cost of the CAS model is
lower than the 3D simulation methods by up to 6 orders of magnitude depending
on the method. This enables the model to be used not only for the rapid
screening of novel fuel candidates, but also for other applications, where ROMs
are useful.

the reliable detection and quantification of these errors critical. In this
work, we introduce an evaluation scheme to capture the fundamental error
sources in camera calibration: systematic errors (biases) and uncertainty
(variance). The proposed bias detection method uncovers smallest systematic
errors and thereby reveals imperfections of the calibration setup and provides
the basis for camera model selection. A novel resampling-based uncertainty
estimator enables uncertainty estimation under non-ideal conditions and thereby
extends the classical covariance estimator. Furthermore, we derive a simple
uncertainty metric that is independent of the camera model. In combination, the
proposed methods can be used to assess the accuracy of individual calibrations,
but also to benchmark new calibration algorithms, camera models, or calibration
setups. We evaluate the proposed methods with simulations and real cameras.

models. However, visual analytics (VA) software tends to leave these models
implicit in the mind of the analyst, which casts doubt on the statistical
validity of informal visual ""insights"". We formally evaluate the quality of
causal inferences from visualizations by adopting causal support -- a Bayesian
cognition model that learns the probability of alternative causal explanations
given some data -- as a normative benchmark for causal inferences. We
contribute two experiments assessing how well crowdworkers can detect (1) a
treatment effect and (2) a confounding relationship. We find that chart users'
causal inferences tend to be insensitive to sample size such that they deviate
from our normative benchmark. While interactively cross-filtering data in
visualizations can improve sensitivity, on average users do not perform
reliably better with common visualizations than they do with textual
contingency tables. These experiments demonstrate the utility of causal support
as an evaluation framework for inferences in VA and point to opportunities to
make analysts' mental models more explicit in VA software.

model for quantum communications, especially over optical networks. We make two
salient contributions in this paper apropos of this channel. First, we consider
a symmetric GAD channel characterized by the parameter $n=1/2,$ and derive its
exact classical capacity, by constructing a specific induced classical channel.
We show that the Holevo quantity for the GAD channel equals the Shannon
capacity of the induced binary symmetric channel, establishing at once the
capacity result and that the GAD channel capacity can be achieved without the
use of entanglement at the encoder or joint measurements at the decoder.
Second, motivated by the inevitable buffering of qubits in quantum networks, we
consider a generalized amplitude damping \emph{queue-channel} -- that is, a
setting where qubits suffer a waiting time dependent GAD noise as they wait in
a buffer to be transmitted. This GAD queue channel is characterized by
non-i.i.d. noise due to correlated waiting times of consecutive qubits. We
exploit a conditional independence property in conjunction with additivity of
the channel model, to obtain a capacity expression for the GAD queue channel in
terms of the stationary waiting time in the queue. Our results provide useful
insights towards designing practical quantum communication networks, and
highlight the need to explicitly model the impact of buffering.

and inference times, which is crucial for training in resource constrained
environments or applications where inference is time critical. State-of-the-art
(SOTA) quantization approaches focus on post-training quantization, i.e.,
quantization of pre-trained DNNs for speeding up inference. While work on
quantized training exists, most approaches require refinement in full precision
(usually single precision) in the final training phase or enforce a global word
length across the entire DNN. This leads to suboptimal assignments of
bit-widths to layers and, consequently, suboptimal resource usage. In an
attempt to overcome such limitations, we introduce AdaPT, a new fixed-point
quantized sparsifying training strategy. AdaPT decides about precision switches
between training epochs based on information theoretic conditions. The goal is
to determine on a per-layer basis the lowest precision that causes no
quantization-induced information loss while keeping the precision high enough
such that future learning steps do not suffer from vanishing gradients. The
benefits of the resulting fully quantized DNN are evaluated based on an
analytical performance model which we develop. We illustrate that an average
speedup of 1.27 compared to standard training in float32 with an average
accuracy increase of 0.98% can be achieved for AlexNet/ResNet on CIFAR10/100

MNIST Fashion library of images and comparing prediction likelihoods with those
obtained from error control-data and from metamorphic test cases. Experimental
results show that the distributions of computational profile likelihood for
training and test cases are somehow similar, while the distribution of the
random-noise control-data is always remarkably lower than the observed one for
the training and testing sets. In contrast, metamorphic test cases show a
prediction likelihood that lies in an extended range with respect to training,
tests, and random noise. Moreover, the presented approach allows the
independent assessment of different training classes and experiments to show
that some of the classes are more sensitive to misclassifying metamorphic test
cases than other classes. In conclusion, metamorphic test cases represent very
aggressive tests for neural network architectures. Furthermore, since
metamorphic test cases force a network to misclassify those inputs whose
likelihood is similar to that of training cases, they could also be considered
as adversarial attacks that evade defenses based on computational profile
likelihood evaluation.

a means to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in empirical approximation
while preserving the Wasserstein structure. Indeed, SWD exhibits parametric
convergence rates and inherits the metric and topological structure of the
classic Wasserstein distance. Motivated by the above, this work conducts a
thorough statistical study of the SWD, including a high-dimensional limit
distribution result for empirical $W_1^\sigma$, bootstrap consistency,
concentration inequalities, and Berry-Esseen type bounds. The derived
nondegenerate limit stands in sharp contrast with the classic empirical $W_1$,
for which a similar result is known only in the one-dimensional case. We also
explore asymptotics and characterize the limit distribution when the smoothing
parameter $\sigma$ is scaled with $n$, converging to $0$ at a sufficiently slow
rate. The dimensionality of the sampled distribution enters empirical SWD
convergence bounds only through the prefactor (i.e., the constant). We provide
a sharp characterization of this prefactor's dependence on the smoothing
parameter and the intrinsic dimension. This result is then used to derive new
empirical convergence rates for classic $W_1$ in terms of the intrinsic
dimension. As applications of the limit distribution theory, we study
two-sample testing and minimum distance estimation (MDE) under $W_1^\sigma$. We
establish asymptotic validity of SWD testing, while for MDE, we prove
measurability, almost sure convergence, and limit distributions for optimal
estimators and their corresponding $W_1^\sigma$ error. Our results suggest that
the SWD is well suited for high-dimensional statistical learning and inference.

hold for any $n$, $r$ and distribution of the node locations. For fixed $r$,
the number of structures is $\Theta(a^{2n})$ with $a=a(r)=2
\cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{\lceil 1/r \rceil+2}\right)}$, and therefore the
structural entropy is upper bounded by $2n\log_2 a(r) + O(1)$. For large $n$,
we derive bounds on the structural entropy normalized by $n$, and evaluate them
for independent and uniformly distributed node locations. When the connection
range $r_n$ is $O(1/n)$, the obtained upper bound is given in terms of a
function that increases with $n r_n$ and asymptotically attains $2$ bits per
node. If the connection range is bounded away from zero and one, the upper and
lower bounds decrease linearly with $r$, as $2(1-r)$ and $(1-r)\log_2 e$,
respectively. When $r_n$ is vanishing but dominates $1/n$ (e.g., $r_n \propto
\ln n / n$), the normalized entropy is between $\log_2 e \approx 1.44$ and $2$
bits per node. We also give a simple encoding scheme for random structures that
requires $2$ bits per node. The upper bounds in this paper easily extend to the
entropy of the labeled random graph model, since this is given by the
structural entropy plus a term that accounts for all the permutations of node
labels that are possible for a given structure, which is no larger than
$\log_2(n!) = n \log_2 n - n + O(\log_2 n)$.

around 40\% of the runtime of the popular Met Office NERC Cloud model (MONC).
Building upon previous work which ported this kernel to an older generation of
Xilinx FPGA, we target latest generation Xilinx Alveo U280 and Intel Stratix 10
FPGAs. Exploring the development of a dataflow design which is performance
portable between vendors, we then describe implementation differences between
the tool chains and compare kernel performance between FPGA hardware. This is
followed by a more general performance comparison, scaling up the number of
kernels on the Xilinx Alveo and Intel Stratix 10, against a 24 core Xeon
Platinum Cascade Lake CPU and NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. When overlapping the
transfer of data to and from the boards with compute, the FPGA solutions
considerably outperform the CPU and, whilst falling short of the GPU in terms
of performance, demonstrate power usage benefits, with the Alveo being
especially power efficient. The result of this work is a comparison and set of
design techniques that apply both to this specific atmospheric advection kernel
on Xilinx and Intel FPGAs, and that are also of interest more widely when

focus on Peer-Peer (P2P) and Provider-Customer (P2C) binary classification and
achieved excellent results. However, there are other types of AS relationships
in actual scenarios, i.e., the businessbased sibling and structure-based
exchange relationships, that were neglected in the previous research. These
relationships are usually difficult to be inferred by existing algorithms
because there is no discrimination on the designed features compared to the P2P

  In this paper, we focus on the multi-classification of AS relationships for
the first time. We first summarize the differences between AS relationships
under the structural and attribute features, and the reasons why multiple
relationships are difficult to be inferred. We then introduce new features and
propose a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) framework, AS-GCN, to solve this
multi-classification problem under complex scene. The framework takes into
account the global network structure and local link features concurrently. The
experiments on real Internet topological data validate the effectiveness of our

classification task, and outperforms a series of baselines on the more
difficult multi-classification task, with the overall accuracy above 95%.

uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques named Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble,

for the formation and dynamics of energetic electron fluxes in various space
plasma systems, including shock waves and planetary radiation belts. The basic
and most elaborated theoretical framework for the description of the integral
effect of multiple resonant interactions is the quasi-linear theory, that
operates through electron diffusion in velocity space. The quasi-linear
diffusion rate scales linearly with the wave intensity, D(QL) is proportional
to Bw2, which should be small enough to satisfy the applicability criteria of
this theory. Spacecraft measurements, however, often detect whistle-mode waves
sufficiently intense to resonate with electrons nonlinearly. Such nonlinear
resonant interactions imply effects of phase trapping and phase bunching, which
may quickly change the electron fluxes in a non-diffusive manner. Both regimes
of electron resonant interactions (diffusive and nonlinear) are well studied,
but there is no theory quantifying the transition between these two regimes. In
this paper we describe the integral effect of nonlinear electron interactions
with whistler-mode waves in terms of the time-scale of electron distribution
relaxation, is about inverse D(NL). We determine the scaling of D(NL) with wave
intensity Bw2 and other main wave characteristics, such as wave-packet size.
The comparison of D(QL) and D(NL) provides the range of wave intensity and
wave-packet sizes where the electron distribution evolves at the same rates for
the diffusive and nonlinear resonant regimes. The obtained results are
discussed in the context of energetic electron dynamics in the Earth's

Phase coherent periodic oscillations in photo generated capacitance as a

tunnelling in this well-dot heterostructure strongly restricts the available
momentum space of the charge carriers within this quantum well. Consequently,
the measured average electric polarization vector of the associated indirect

As a result, these excitons continuously undergo Bose-Einstein condensation

excitonic peaks in the optical spectra based on photocapacitance confirm such
tunneling induced variations in quantum coupling of electrons between quantum
well and quantum dots. Observation of negative quantum capacitance due to
screening of charge carriers by the quantum well indicate periodic variation of

acceptable form, i.e., using semantically similar words as substitutions, and
thus it is considered as a fundamental stepping-stone towards broader
robustness in natural language processing. Previous defense methods capture
word substitutions in vector space by using either $l_2$-ball or
hyper-rectangle, which results in perturbation sets that are not inclusive
enough or unnecessarily large, and thus impedes mimicry of worst cases for
robust training. In this paper, we introduce a novel \textit{Adversarial Sparse
Convex Combination} (ASCC) method. We model the word substitution attack space
as a convex hull and leverages a regularization term to enforce perturbation
towards an actual substitution, thus aligning our modeling better with the
discrete textual space. Based on the ASCC method, we further propose
ASCC-defense, which leverages ASCC to generate worst-case perturbations and
incorporates adversarial training towards robustness. Experiments show that
ASCC-defense outperforms the current state-of-the-arts in terms of robustness
on two prevailing NLP tasks, \emph{i.e.}, sentiment analysis and natural
language inference, concerning several attacks across multiple model
architectures. Besides, we also envision a new class of defense towards
robustness in NLP, where our robustly trained word vectors can be plugged into

X-ray burst. Using the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, we started
observing the source three hours after the burst was detected with MAXI/GSC,
and monitored the source for the subsequent twelve days. We observed the tail
end of the X-ray burst cooling phase, and find that the X-ray flux is severely
depressed relative to its historic value for a three day period directly
following the burst. We interpret this intensity dip as the inner accretion
disk gradually restoring itself after being perturbed by the burst irradiation.
Superimposed on this trend we observed a $1.5$ d interval during which the
X-ray flux is sharply lower than the wider trend. This drop in flux could be
isolated to the non-thermal components in the energy spectrum, suggesting that
it may be caused by an evolving corona. Additionally, we detected a 3.4 keV
absorption line at $6.3\sigma$ significance in a single $472$ s observation
while the burst emission was still bright. We tentatively identify the line as
a gravitationally redshifted absorption line from burning ashes on the stellar
surface, possibly associated with ${}^{40}{\rm Ca}$ or ${}^{44}{\rm Ti}$.

nonlinear restoring, and stochastic driving forces. The (long-term) mean values
of our turbulent functions vanish. In particular, turbulence does not damp the
oscillation modes, so `turbulent viscosity' is not operative. However, the
frequency components of the turbulent driving force near that of the mode can
produce significant changes in the amplitude of the mode. Even with an
additional (phenomenological constant) source of damping, this leads to an
eventual `blowout' (onset of effects of nonlinearity) if the turbulence is
sufficiently strong or the damping constant is sufficiently small. The
infrequent large increases in the energy of the mode could be related to the
observed low duty cycles of the HFQPOs. The width of the peak in the power

construction. There are multiple choices of consistent phases, which give rise
to physically distinct resolutions. We apply decomposition, and find that
theories with enlarged orbifold groups are equivalent to (disjoint unions of

In effect, decomposition implies that enlarging the orbifold group is
equivalent to making it smaller. We provide a general conjecture for such

exploiting two properties of systems involving collisions between high energy
electrons and intense laser pulses. The first property is that the
electron-intense-laser collision results in a large flux of hard photons, as
the laser behaves effectively as a thick medium. The second property is that
the emitted photons free-stream inside the laser and thus for them the laser
behaves effectively as a very thin medium. Combining these two features implies
that the electron-intense-laser collision is an apparatus which can efficiently
convert UV electrons to a large flux of hard, co-linear photons. We further
propose to direct this unique large and hard flux of photons onto a physical
dump which in turn is capable of producing feebly interacting massive
particles, in a region of parameters that has never been probed before. We
denote this novel apparatus as ``optical dump'' or NPOD (new physics search
with optical dump). The proposed LUXE experiment at Eu.XFEL has all the
required basic ingredients of the above experimental concept. We discuss how
this concept can be realized in practice by adding a detector after the last
physical dump of the experiment to reconstruct the two-photon decay product of
a new spin-0 particle. We show that even with a relatively short dump, the
search can still be background free. Remarkably, even with a 40 TW laser, which
corresponds to the initial run, and definitely with a 350 TW laser, of the main
run with one year of data taking, LUXE-NPOD will be able to probe uncharted
territory of both models of pseudo-scalar and scalar fields, and in particular
probe natural of scalar theories for masses above 100 MeV.

reverberate off the disk provide a view of the environment just outside the
event horizon. I Zwicky 1 (I Zw 1), is a nearby narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy.
Previous studies of the reverberation of X-rays from its accretion disk
revealed that the corona is composed of two components; an extended, slowly
varying component over the surface of the inner accretion disk, and a
collimated core, with luminosity fluctuations propagating upwards from its
base, which dominates the more rapid variability. Here we report observations
of X-ray flares emitted from around the supermassive black hole in I Zw 1.
X-ray reflection from the accretion disk is detected through a relativistically
broadened iron K line and Compton hump in the X-ray emission spectrum. Analysis
of the X-ray flares reveals short flashes of photons consistent with the
re-emergence of emission from behind the black hole. The energy shifts of these
photons identify their origins from different parts of the disk. These are
photons that reverberate off the far side of the disk and bent around the black
hole and magnified by the strong gravitational field. Observing photons bent
around the black hole confirms a key prediction of General Relativity.

spiral structures have been detected in scattered light, millimeter continuum,
and CO gas emission. The mechanisms causing these structures are still under
debate. A popular scenario to drive the spiral arms is the one of a planet
perturbing the material in the disk. However, if the disk is massive,
gravitational instability is usually the favored explanation. Multiwavelength
studies could be helpful to distinguish between the two scenarios. So far, only
a handful of disks with spiral arms have been observed in both scattered light
and millimeter continuum. We aim to perform an in-depth characterization of the
protoplanetary disk morphology around WaOph 6 analyzing data obtained at
different wavelengths, as well as to investigate the origin of the spiral
features in the disk. We present the first near-infrared polarimetric
observations of WaOph 6 obtained with SPHERE at the VLT and compare them to
archival millimeter continuum ALMA observations. We traced the spiral features
in both data sets and estimated the respective pitch angles. We discuss the
different scenarios that can give rise to the spiral arms in WaOph 6. We tested
the planetary perturber hypothesis by performing hydrodynamical and radiative

Violent Disc Instability, attempting to distinguish between long-lived clumps
that migrate inward and short-lived clumps that disrupt by feedback. We study
the evolution of clumps as they migrate through the disc using an analytic
model tested by simulations and confront theory with CANDELS observations. The
clump ``bathtub"" model, which considers gas and stellar gain and loss, is
characterized by four parameters: the accretion efficiency, the
star-formation-rate (SFR) efficiency, and the outflow mass-loading factors for
gas and stars. The relevant timescales are all comparable to the migration
time, two-three orbital times. A clump differs from a galaxy by the internal
dependence of the accretion rate on the varying clump mass. The analytic
solution, involving exponential growing and decaying modes, reveals a main
evolution phase during the migration, where the SFR and gas mass are constant
and the stellar mass is rising linearly with time. This makes the inverse of
the specific SFR an observable proxy for clump age. Later, the masses and SFR
approach an exponential growth with a constant specific SFR, but this phase is
hypothetical as the clump disappears in the galaxy center. The model matches
simulations with different, moderate feedback, both in isolated and
cosmological settings. The observed clumps agree with our theoretical
predictions, indicating that the massive clumps are long-lived and migrating. A
non-trivial challenge is to model feedback that is non-disruptive in massive
clumps but suppresses SFR to match the galactic stellar-to-halo mass ratio.

(VLMS) surrounded by a nearly edge-on, extremely large disc. Recent
observations revealed that this source hosts a binary surrounded by an extended
circumbinary disc with a central dust cavity. In this paper, we combine ALMA
multi-wavelength observations of continuum and $^{12}$CO line emission, with
H$\alpha$ imaging and Keck astrometric measures of the binary to develop a
coherent dynamical model of this system. The system features an azimuthal
asymmetry detected at the western edge of the cavity in Band~7 observations and
a wiggling outflow. Dust emission in ALMA Band 4 from the proximity of the
individual stars suggests the presence of marginally resolved circumstellar
discs. We estimate the binary orbital parameters from the measured arc of the
orbit from Keck and ALMA astrometry. We further constrain these estimates using
considerations from binary-disc interaction theory. We finally perform three
SPH gas + dust simulations based on the theoretical constraints; we
post-process the hydrodynamic output using radiative transfer Monte Carlo
methods and directly compare the models with observations. Our results suggest
that a highly eccentric $e\sim 0.5\textrm{--}0.7$ equal mass binary, with a

circumbinary disc inclination $\theta\lesssim 30^\circ$ provides a good match

the physical processes that shape the structure and dynamics of the
interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we quantify the structure of the HI
gas in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies taken from the THINGS Survey using the
delta-variance spectrum. The THINGS galaxies display a large diversity in their
spectra, however, there are a number of recurrent features. In many galaxies,
we observe a bump in the spectrum on scales of a few to several hundred pc. We
find the characteristic scales associated with the bump to be correlated with
galactic SFR for values of the SFR > 0.5 M$_{sol}$ yr$^{-1}$ and also with the
median size of the HI shells detected in those galaxies. On larger scales, we
observe the existence of two self-similar regimes. The first one, on
intermediate scales is shallow and the power law that describes this regime has
an exponent in the range [0.1-1] with a mean value of 0.55 which is compatible
with the density field being generated by supersonic turbulence in the cold
phase of the HI gas. The second power law is steeper, with a range of exponents
between [0.5-1.5] and a mean value of 1.5. These values are associated with
subsonic turbulence which is characteristic of the warm phase of the HI gas.
The spatial scale at which the transition between the two regimes occurs is
found to be $\approx 0.5 R_{25}$ which is similar to the size of the molecular
disk in the THINGS galaxies. Overall, our results suggest that on scales < $0.5
R_{25}$, the structure of the ISM is affected by the effects of supernova
explosions. On larger scales (> 0.5 $R_{25}$), stellar feedback has no
significant impact, and the structure of the ISM is determined by large scale
processes that govern the dynamics of the gas in the warm neutral medium such
as the flaring of the HI disk and the effects of ram pressure stripping.

of potential NP interpretations. In this article we investigate the interplay

low-temperature equilibrium states. However, much of nature is not in thermal
equilibrium. Remarkably, it was recently predicted that out-of-equilibrium
systems can exhibit novel dynamical phases that may otherwise be forbidden by
equilibrium thermodynamics, a paradigmatic example being the discrete time
crystal (DTC). Concretely, dynamical phases can be defined in periodically
driven many-body localized systems via the concept of eigenstate order. In
eigenstate-ordered phases, the entire many-body spectrum exhibits quantum
correlations and long-range order, with characteristic signatures in late-time
dynamics from all initial states. It is, however, challenging to experimentally
distinguish such stable phases from transient phenomena, wherein few select
states can mask typical behavior. Here we implement a continuous family of
tunable CPHASE gates on an array of superconducting qubits to experimentally
observe an eigenstate-ordered DTC. We demonstrate the characteristic
spatiotemporal response of a DTC for generic initial states. Our work employs a
time-reversal protocol that discriminates external decoherence from intrinsic
thermalization, and leverages quantum typicality to circumvent the exponential
cost of densely sampling the eigenspectrum. In addition, we locate the phase
transition out of the DTC with an experimental finite-size analysis. These
results establish a scalable approach to study non-equilibrium phases of matter

Such small masses are in the reach of future detectors as ABRACADABRA, KLASH,

  2022 Workshop on Computer Vision for Metaverse (cv4metaverse)",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Free-standing social conversations constitute a yet underexplored setting for
human behavior forecasting. While the task of predicting pedestrian
trajectories has received much recent attention, an intrinsic difference
between these settings is how groups form and disband. Evidence from social
psychology suggests that group members in a conversation explicitly
self-organize to sustain the interaction by adapting to one another's
behaviors. Crucially, the same individual is unlikely to adapt similarly across
different groups; contextual factors such as perceived relationships,
attraction, rapport, etc., influence the entire spectrum of participants'
behaviors. A question arises: how can we jointly forecast the mutually
dependent futures of conversation partners by modeling the dynamics unique to
every group? In this paper, we propose the Social Process (SP) models, taking a
novel meta-learning and stochastic perspective of group dynamics. Training
group-specific forecasting models hinders generalization to unseen groups and
is challenging given limited conversation data. In contrast, our SP models
treat interaction sequences from a single group as a meta-dataset: we condition
forecasts for a sequence from a given group on other observed-future sequence
pairs from the same group. In this way, an SP model learns to adapt its
forecasts to the unique dynamics of the interacting partners, generalizing to
unseen groups in a data-efficient manner. Additionally, we first rethink the
task formulation itself, motivating task requirements from social science
literature that prior formulations have overlooked. For our formulation of
Social Cue Forecasting, we evaluate the empirical performance of our SP models
against both non-meta-learning and meta-learning approaches with similar
assumptions. The SP models yield improved performance on synthetic and
real-world behavior datasets.

rely on the assumption that the correlations with the environment can be
neglected at some reference (initial) time. While being reasonable in specific
instances, such as when the coupling between the system and the environment is
weak or when the interaction starts at a distinguished time, the use of
initially uncorrelated states is questionable if one wants to deal with general
models, taking into account the mutual influence that the open-system and
environmental evolutions perform on each other. Here, we introduce a
perturbative method that can be applied to any microscopic modeling of the
system-environment interaction, including fully general initial correlations.
Extending the standard technique based on projection operators that single out
the relevant part of the global dynamics, we define a family of projections
adapted to a convenient decomposition of the initial state, which involves a
convex mixture of product operators with proper environmental states. This
leads us to characterize the open-system dynamics via an uncoupled system of
differential equations, which are homogeneous and whose number is limited by
the dimensionality of the open system, for any kind of initial correlations.
Our method is further illustrated by means of two cases study, for which it
reproduces the expected dynamical behavior in the long-time regime more
consistently than the standard projection technique.

correct for the noise contribution to asymmetry at very low signal-to-noise,

present algebraic corrections for noise and resolution to recover the intrinsic

already surpass HL-LHC, reaching 2 standard deviations with around 4000/fb of

discussed, which may be more obvious at higher energy muon colliders, as the

supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an

model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform
prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a
textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language
model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a
final string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is
powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model
to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new
prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot
learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper
we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of

scenarios featuring a general nonstandard cosmology. Before the onset of Big
Bang nucleosynthesis, the energy density of the universe is dominated by a
particle field $\phi$ described by a general equation of state $\omega$. The
ensuing enhancement of the Hubble expansion rate decreases the temperature at
which axions start to oscillate, opening this way the possibility for axions
heavier than in the standard window. This is the case for kination, or in
general for scenarios with $\omega > 1/3$. However, if $\omega < 1/3$, as in
the case of an early matter domination, the decay of $\phi$ injects additional
entropy relative to the case of the standard model, diluting this way the
preexisting axion abundance, and rendering lighter axions viable. For a
misalignment angle $0.5 < \theta_i < \pi/\sqrt{3}$, the usual axion window
becomes expanded to $4 \times 10^{-9}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 2 \times
10^{-5}$ eV for the case of an early matter domination, or to $2 \times

yield much richer information - e.g., continuous current values, discrete
photon counts - which is then mapped into binary outcomes by discarding some of
this information. In this work, we consider methods to incorporate all of this
richer information, typically called soft information, into the decoding of
quantum error correction codes, and in particular the surface code. We describe
how to modify both the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching and Union-Find decoders
to leverage soft information, and demonstrate these soft decoders outperform
the standard (hard) decoders that can only access the binary measurement
outcomes. Moreover, we observe that the soft decoder achieves a threshold 25\%
higher than any hard decoder for phenomenological noise with Gaussian soft
measurement outcomes. We also introduce a soft measurement error model with
amplitude damping, in which measurement time leads to a trade-off between
measurement resolution and additional disturbance of the qubits. Under this
model we observe that the performance of the surface code is very sensitive to
the choice of the measurement time - for a distance-19 surface code, a
five-fold increase in measurement time can lead to a thousand-fold increase in
logical error rate. Moreover, the measurement time that minimizes the physical
error rate is distinct from the one that minimizes the logical performance,
pointing to the benefits of jointly optimizing the physical and quantum error
correction layers.

ground states and low-lying excitations of these chains exhibit large

particular form of the projectors causes the emergence of disjoint Krylov
subspaces for open boundary conditions, with an exact quantum scar being
embedded in each subspace, leading to slow growth of entanglement and localized
dynamics for specific out-of-equilibrium initial states. Furthermore, focusing
on infinite temperature, we unveil that spin transport is subdiffusive, which
we corroborate by simulations of constrained stochastic cellular automaton
circuits. Compared to dipole moment conserving systems, the deformed Motzkin
chain appears to belong to a different universality class with distinct

learning systems. To this end, we use the NiCad tool to detect clones from 59
Python, 14 C# and 6 Java-based deep learning systems and an equal number of
traditional software systems. We then analyze the frequency and distribution of
code clones in deep learning and traditional systems. We do further analysis of
the distribution of code clones using location-based taxonomy. We also study
the correlation between bugs and code clones to assess the impacts of clones on
the quality of the studied systems. Finally, we introduce a code clone taxonomy
related to deep learning programs and identify the deep learning system
development phases in which cloning has the highest risk of faults. Our results
show that code cloning is a frequent practice in deep learning systems and that
deep learning developers often clone code from files in distant repositories in
the system. In addition, we found that code cloning occurs more frequently
during DL model construction. And that hyperparameters setting is the phase
during which cloning is the riskiest, since it often leads to faults.

to image for structural and chemical discovery via atomically resolved imaging
has traditionally proceeded via human operators making semi-informed judgements
on sampling locations and parameters. Recent efforts at automation for
structural and physical discovery have pointed towards the use of ""active

quickly find relevant regions of interest. Yet despite the potential importance
of this direction, there is a general lack of certainty in selecting relevant
control algorithms and how to balance a priori knowledge of the material system

developing the automated experiment workflows with several combinations to both
illustrate the effects of these choices and demonstrate the tradeoffs
associated with each in terms of accuracy, robustness, and susceptibility to
hyperparameters for structural discovery. We discuss possible methods to build
descriptors using the raw image data and deep learning based semantic

demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model against several baseline

Dynamical Instability (TEDI), in which mass loss in evolving triples triggers
short-term dynamical instabilities, potentially leading to collisions of stars,
exchanges, and ejections. Previous work has shown that the TEDI is an important
pathway to head-on stellar collisions in the Galaxy, significantly exceeding
the rate of collisions due to random encounters in globular clusters. Here, we
revisit the TEDI evolutionary pathway using state-of-the-art population
synthesis methods that self-consistently take into account stellar evolution
and binary interactions, as well as gravitational dynamics and perturbations
from passing stars in the field. We find Galactic TEDI-induced collision rates
on the order of 1e-4/yr, consistent with previous studies which were based on
more simplified methods. The majority of TEDI-induced collisions involve main
sequence stars, potentially producing blue straggler stars. Collisions are also
possible involving more evolved stars, potentially producing eccentric
post-common-envelope systems, and white dwarfs collisions leading to Type Ia
supernovae (although the latter with a negligible contribution to the Galactic
rate). In our simulations, the TEDI is not only triggered by adiabatic wind
mass loss, but also by Roche lobe overflow in the inner binary: when the donor
star becomes less massive than the accretor, the inner binary orbit widens,
triggering triple dynamical instability. We find that collision rates are
increased by ~17% when fly-bys in the field are taken into account. In addition
to collisions, we find that the TEDI produces ~1e-4/yr of unbound stars,
although none with escape speeds in excess of 1e3 km/s.

distinguish linear ($p \approx 1$) from nonlinear ($p \gapprox 2$) events. The
power law slopes $\alpha$ of observed waiting times (with full solar cycle
coverage) cover a range of $\alpha=2.1-2.4$, which agrees well with our

with the time evolution of the logistic equation, for which we find a

The Sun exhibits memory on time scales of $\lapprox$2 hours to 3 days (for

parameter in the study of an EFT such as the SMEFT. However, for the processes
at a hadron collider with neutrinos in the final states, the energy scales are
difficult to reconstruct. In this paper, we study the energy scale of anomalous

has only five fitting parameters and works much better than the approximation

addresses AI assurance challenges lying at the intersection of domain
adaptation, fairness, and counterfactuals analysis, operating via the discovery
and intervention on factors of variations in data (e.g. weather or illumination
conditions) that significantly affect the robustness of AI models. Robustness
is understood here as insensitivity of the model performance to variations in
sensitive factors. Sensitive factors are traditionally set in a supervised
setting, whereby factors are known a-priori (e.g. for fairness this could be
factors like sex or race). In contrast, our motivation is real-life scenarios
where less, or nothing, is actually known a-priori about certain factors that
cause models to fail. This leads us to consider various settings (unsupervised,
domain generalization, semi-supervised) that correspond to different degrees of
incomplete knowledge about those factors. Therefore, our two step approach
works by a) discovering sensitive factors that cause AI systems to fail in a
unsupervised fashion, and then b) intervening models to lessen these factor's
influence. Our method considers 3 interventions consisting of Augmentation,
Coherence, and Adversarial Interventions (ACAI). We demonstrate the ability for
interventions on discovered/source factors to generalize to target/real
factors. We also demonstrate how adaptation to real factors of variations can
be performed in the semi-supervised case where some target factor labels are
known, via automated intervention selection. Experiments show that our approach
improves on baseline models, with regard to achieving optimal utility vs.

that represents the involved domain in reality. In requirements engineering,
building such a model is considered a bridge to the design and construction
phases. However, this type of model can also serve as a basic model for
identifying business processes and how these processes are interconnected to
achieve the final result. This paper focuses on process modeling in
organizations, per se, beyond its application in the SDLC when an organization
needs further documentation to meet its growth needs and address regular
changes over time. The resultant process documentation is created alongside the
daily operations of the business process. The model provides process
visualization and documentation to assist in defining work patterns, avoiding
redundancy, or even designing new processes. In this paper, a proposed
diagrammatic representation models each process using one diagram comprising
five actions and two types of relationships to build three levels of depiction.
These levels consist of a static description, events, and the behavior of the
modeled process. The viability of a thinging machine is demonstrated by
re-modeling some examples from the literature.

to recompose a mixture of recordings, or remixing, is common across a variety
of applications such as music production, audio-visual post-production,
podcasts, and more. This process, however, traditionally requires access to
individual source recordings, restricting the creative process. To work around
this, source separation algorithms can separate a mixture into its respective
components. Then, a user can adjust their levels and mix them back together.
This two-step approach, however, still suffers from audible artifacts and
motivates further work. In this work, we learn to remix music directly by
re-purposing Conv-TasNet, a well-known source separation model, into two neural
remixing architectures. To do this, we use an explicit loss term that directly
measures remix quality and jointly optimize it with a separation loss. We
evaluate our methods using the Slakh and MUSDB18 datasets and report remixing
performance as well as the impact on source separation as a byproduct. Our
results suggest that learning-to-remix significantly outperforms a strong
separation baseline and is particularly useful for small volume changes.

provide valuable constraints on possible heating/heat-transport mechanisms. We
present a method for the detection and analysis of brightenings and demonstrate
its application to IRIS EUV time-series imagery. The method uses band-pass
filtering, adaptive thresholding and centroid tracking, and records an event's
position, duration, and total/maximum brightness. Area, brightness, and
position are also recorded as functions of time throughout their lifetime.
Detected brightenings can fragment or merge over time, thus the number of
distinct regions constituting a brightening event is recorded over time and the
maximum number of regions are recorded as a simple measure of an event's
coherence/complexity. A test is made on a synthetic datacube composed of a
static background based on IRIS data, Poisson noise and $\approx10^4$
randomly-distributed, moving, small-scale Gaussian brightenings. Maximum
brightness, total brightness, area, and duration follow power-law distributions
and the results show the range over which the method can extract information.
The recorded maximum brightness is a reliable measure for the brightest and
most accurately detected events with an error of 6%. Area, duration, and speed
are generally underestimated by 15% with an uncertainty of 20-30%. Total
brightness is underestimated by 30% with an uncertainty of 30%. Applying this
method to real IRIS QS data spanning 19 minutes over a 54.40""$\times$55.23"" FOV
yields 2997 detections. 1340 of these either remain un-fragmented or fragment
to two distinct regions at least once during their lifetime equating to an
event density of $3.96\times10^{-4}$arcsec$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The method will be
used for a future large-scale statistical analysis of several QS data sets from
IRIS, other EUV imagers, as well as H-$\alpha$ and visible photospheric

effective and reliable defense methods against adversarial attacks. However,
almost all existing studies about adversarial training are focused on balanced
datasets, where each class has an equal amount of training examples. Research
on adversarial training with imbalanced training datasets is rather limited. As
the initial effort to investigate this problem, we reveal the facts that
adversarially trained models present two distinguished behaviors from naturally
trained models in imbalanced datasets: (1) Compared to natural training,
adversarially trained models can suffer much worse performance on
under-represented classes, when the training dataset is extremely imbalanced.
(2) Traditional reweighting strategies may lose efficacy to deal with the
imbalance issue for adversarial training. For example, upweighting the
under-represented classes will drastically hurt the model's performance on
well-represented classes, and as a result, finding an optimal reweighting value
can be tremendously challenging. In this paper, to further understand our
observations, we theoretically show that the poor data separability is one key
reason causing this strong tension between under-represented and
well-represented classes. Motivated by this finding, we propose Separable
Reweighted Adversarial Training (SRAT) to facilitate adversarial training under
imbalanced scenarios, by learning more separable features for different
classes. Extensive experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of
the proposed framework.

person in images or videos is an important task that can be applied in action
recognition and object tracking. As have many computer vision tasks, HPE has
advanced massively with the introduction of deep learning to the field. In this
paper, we focus on one of the deep learning-based approaches of HPE proposed by
Newell et al., which they named the stacked hourglass network. Their approach
is widely used in many applications and is regarded as one of the best works in
this area. The main focus of their approach is to capture as much information
as it can at all possible scales so that a coherent understanding of the local
features and full-body location is achieved. Their findings demonstrate that
important cues such as orientation of a person, arrangement of limbs, and
adjacent joints' relative location can be identified from multiple scales at
different resolutions. To do so, they makes use of a single pipeline to process
images in multiple resolutions, which comprises a skip layer to not lose
spatial information at each resolution. The resolution of the images stretches
as lower as 4x4 to make sure that a smaller spatial feature is included. In
this study, we study the effect of architectural modifications on the

tackled using promotion-based replacement policies like re-reference interval

allocation schemes. In GPU systems, similar LLC issues are alleviated using
various cache bypassing techniques. These issues are worsened in heterogeneous
CPU-GPU systems because the two processors have different data access patterns
and frequencies. GPUs generally work on streaming data, but have many more
threads accessing memory as compared to CPUs. As such, most traditional cache
replacement and allocation policies prove ineffective due to the higher number
of cache accesses in GPU applications, resulting in higher allocation for GPU
cache lines, despite their minimal reuse. In this work, we implement the Reuse
Cache approach for heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems. The reuse cache is a
decoupled tag/data SLLC which is designed to only store the data that is being
accessed more than once. This design is based on the observation that most of
the cache lines in the LLC are stored but do not get reused before being
replaced. We find that the reuse cache achieves within 0.5% of the IPC gains of
a statically partitioned LLC, while decreasing the area cost of the LLC by an

representation became popular recently due to the rapid development of fast and
efficient deep-learning-based object-detection methods. The proposed approach
allows for comparing sets of bounding boxes to estimate the degree of
similarity of their underlying images. It is based on the fuzzy approach that
uses the fuzzy mutual position (FMP) matrix to describe spatial composition and
relations between bounding boxes within an image. A method of computing the
similarity of two images described by their FMP matrices is proposed and the
algorithm of its computation. It outputs the single scalar value describing the
degree of content-based image similarity. By modifying the method`s parameters,
instead of similarity, the reflectional symmetry of object composition may also
be measured. The proposed approach allows for measuring differences in objects`
composition of various intensities. It is also invariant to translation and
scaling and - in case of symmetry detection - position and orientation of the
symmetry axis. A couple of examples illustrate the method.

  Bangladesh",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Demand forecasting in power sector has become an important part of modern
demand management and response systems with the rise of smart metering enabled
grids. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) shows promising results in predicting time
series data which can also be applied to power load demand in smart grids. In
this paper, an LSTM based model using neural network architecture is proposed
to forecast power demand. The model is trained with hourly energy and power
usage data of four years from a smart grid. After training and prediction, the
accuracy of the model is compared against the traditional statistical time
series analysis algorithms, such as Auto-Regressive (AR), to determine the
efficiency. The mean absolute percentile error is found to be 1.22 in the
proposed LSTM model, which is the lowest among the other models. From the
findings, it is clear that the inclusion of neural network in predicting power
demand reduces the error of prediction significantly. Thus, the application of
LSTM can enable a more efficient demand response system.

model high-dimensional data commonplace in many scientific fields, and
representing a binary tensor as a Boolean tensor network is the task of
expressing a tensor containing categorical (i.e., {0, 1}) values as a product
of low dimensional binary tensors. A Boolean tensor network is computed by
Boolean tensor decomposition, and it is usually not exact. The aim of such
decomposition is to minimize the given distance measure between the
high-dimensional input tensor and the product of lower-dimensional (usually
three-dimensional) tensors and matrices representing the tensor network. In
this paper, we introduce and analyze three general algorithms for Boolean
tensor networks: Tucker, Tensor Train, and Hierarchical Tucker networks. The
computation of a Boolean tensor network is reduced to a sequence of Boolean
matrix factorizations, which we show can be expressed as a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization problem suitable for solving on a quantum

collapse of modality-specific feature space or introducing extra noise. To
mitigate this, we propose the Bi-Bimodal Fusion Network (BBFN), a novel

nonincreasing quality with time. The paper first addresses the problem of

are NP-Hard. However, a practical ""time-slot"" version of the problem, where

changes across the U.S. states and identifies where and why that assumption may
not be valid. More specifically, what determines the transmission mechanism of
tax shocks at the state level? How vital are states' fiscal structures,
financial conditions, labor market rigidities, and industry mix? Do these
economic and structural characteristics drive the transmission mechanism of the
tax changes at the state level at different horizons? This study employs a
panel factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) technique to answer these
issues. The findings show that state economies respond homogeneously in terms
of employment and price levels; however, they react heterogeneously in real GDP
and personal income growth. In most states, these reactions are statistically
significant, and the heterogeneity in the effects of tax cuts is significantly
related to the state's fiscal structure, manufacturing and financial
composition, and the labor market's rigidity. A cross-state regression analysis
shows that states with higher tax elasticity, higher personal income tax,
strict labor market regulation, and economic policy uncertainties are
relatively less responsive to federal tax changes. In contrast, the magnitude
of the response in real GDP, personal income, and employment to tax cuts is
relatively higher in states with a larger share of finance, manufacturing,
lower tax burdens, and flexible credit markets.

problem: what functions $f:\mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}$ can be computed by a
CRN, in which the CRN eventually produces the correct amount of the ""output""
molecule, no matter the rate at which reactions proceed? This captures a
previously unexplored, but very natural class of computations: for example, the
reaction $X_1 + X_2 \to Y$ can be thought to compute the function $y =
\min(x_1, x_2)$. Such a CRN is robust in the sense that it is correct no matter
the kinetic model of chemistry, so long as it respects the stoichiometric
constraints.
  We develop a reachability relation based on ""what could happen"" if reaction
rates can vary arbitrarily over time. We define *stable computation*
analogously to probability 1 computation in distributed computing, and connect
it with a seemingly stronger notion of rate-independent computation based on
convergence under a wide class of generalized rate laws. We also consider the
""dual-rail representation"" that can represent negative values as the difference
of two concentrations and allows the composition of CRN modules. We prove that
a function is rate-independently computable if and only if it is piecewise
linear (with rational coefficients) and continuous (dual-rail representation),
or non-negative with discontinuities occurring only when some inputs switch
from zero to positive (direct representation). The many contexts where
continuous piecewise linear functions are powerful targets for implementation,
combined with the systematic construction we develop for computing these
functions, demonstrate the potential of rate-independent chemical computation.

temperature (mostly greater than $10^{6}$\,K). Here we analyze the impact of
diffuse gas associated with nearby galaxies using the dispersion measures (DMs)

of the total ionized-gas contents along their sightlines. Out of a sample of
474 distant FRBs from the CHIME/FRB Catalog 1(3), we identify a subset of

$>90$\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$ with $>95\%$ confidence. The excess is larger than
expected for the diffuse gas surrounding isolated galaxies, but may be
explained by additional contributions from gas surrounding galaxy groups,

to large network such as ResNet and HRNet due to its limited fusion operation
in the network. Specifically, we expand the number of fusion operation by
building bridges between two pyramid frameworks without adding layers.
Meanwhile, to capture long-range dependency, we propose a lightweight attention
block -- HSA, which computes second-order attention map. In summary, SFM
maximizes the number of feature fusion in a limited number of layers. HSA
learns high precise spatial information by computing the attention of spatial
attention map. With the help of SFM and HSA, our network is able to generate
multi-level feature and extract precise global spatial information with little
computing resource. Thus, our method achieve comparable or even better accuracy
with less parameters and computational cost. Our SFM achieve 89.0 in PCKh@0.5,
42.0 in PCKh@0.1 on MPII validation set and 71.7 in AP, 90.7 in AP@0.5 on COCO
validation with only 1.7G FLOPs and 1.5M parameters. The source code will be
public soon.

on computation in distributed computing frameworks. The emerging programmable
switches make in-network computing (INC) possible, i.e., offloading some
computation to the switch data plane. While some proposals have attempted to
offload computation onto special hardwares (e.g., NetFPGA), many practical
issues have not been addressed. Therefore, we propose P4COM - a user-friendly,
memory-efficient, and fault-tolerant framework realizing in-network computation
(e.g., MapReduce) with programmable switches.
  P4COM consists of three modules. First, P4COM automatically translates
application logic to switch data plane programs with a lightweight interpreter.
Second, P4COM adopts a memory management policy to efficiently utilize the
limited switch on-chip memory. Third, P4COM provides a cutting-payload
mechanism to handle packet losses. We have built a P4COM prototype with a
Barefoot Tofino switch and multiple commodity servers. Through a combination of
testbed experiments and large-scale simulations, we show that P4COM is able to
achieve line-rate processing at 10Gbps links, and can increase the data
shuffling throughput by 2-5 times for the MapReduce-style applications.

strategies to detect these neutrinos, which, if seen, would push forward our

high-energy through-going muon events collected in the years of maximum solar
activity and yielded only flux upper limits, to include data taken during the
solar minimum from 2018 to 2020. Extending the analysis to the solar minimum is
important as the gamma-ray data collected during past solar cycles indicates a
possible enhancement in the high-energy neutrino flux. Second, we will
incorporate sub-TeV events and include contributions from all neutrino flavors.
These will improve our analysis sensitivity since the solar atmospheric
spectrum is soft and, due to oscillation, contains significant contributions of
all neutrino flavors. As we will present in this contribution, these
complementary strategies yield a significant improvement in sensitivity, making
substantial progress towards observing this flux.

information bottleneck (IB), in which the goal is to compress an ``input''

consequences of resource limitations. In the spirit of Alan Turing's simple yet
powerful definition of a computer, the Turing Machine (TM), and perspective of
computational complexity theory, we formalize a modified version of the Global
Workspace Theory (GWT) of consciousness originated by cognitive neuroscientist
Bernard Baars and further developed by him, Stanislas Dehaene, Jean-Pierre
Changeaux and others. We are not looking for a complex model of the brain nor
of cognition, but for a simple computational model of (the admittedly complex
concept of) consciousness. We do this by defining the Conscious Turing Machine
(CTM), also called a conscious AI, and then we define consciousness and related
notions in the CTM. While these are only mathematical (TCS) definitions, we
suggest why the CTM has the feeling of consciousness. The TCS perspective
provides a simple formal framework to employ tools from computational
complexity theory and machine learning to help us understand consciousness and
related concepts. Previously we explored high level explanations for the
feelings of pain and pleasure in the CTM. Here we consider three examples
related to vision (blindsight, inattentional blindness, and change blindness),

for detecting such problems, but their analysis does not scale because it may

Concentrating on the problem of detecting dead listeners, we present an

large elastic deformation in most solids is usually difficult to achieve and
the strain gradient at minuscule is challenging to control. Here we exploit the

  methods beyond projected networks","17 pages, 11 figures",,,,"nlin.AO cond-mat.dis-nn nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A common approach for analyzing hypergraphs is to consider the projected
adjacency or Laplacian matrices for each order of interactions (e.g., dyadic,
triadic, etc.). However, this method can lose information about the hypergraph
structure and is not universally applicable for studying dynamical processes on
hypergraphs, which we demonstrate through the framework of cluster
synchronization. Specifically, we show that the projected network does not
always correspond to a unique hypergraph structure. This means the projection
does not always properly predict the true dynamics unfolding on the hypergraph.
Additionally, we show that the symmetry group consisting of permutations that
preserve the hypergraph structure can be distinct from the symmetry group of
its projected matrix. Thus, considering the full hypergraph is required for
analyzing the most general types of dynamics on hypergraphs. We show that a
formulation based on node clusters and the corresponding edge clusters induced
by the node partitioning, enables the analysis of admissible patterns of
cluster synchronization and their effective dynamics. Additionally, we show
that the coupling matrix projections corresponding to each edge cluster
synchronization pattern, and not just to each order of interactions, are
necessary for understanding the structure of the Jacobian matrix and performing
the linear stability calculations efficiently.

spring during the periodic hopping. Hopping like a spring is efficient and
without the requirement of complicated control algorithms. Position and force
control are two main methods to realize such a spring-like behaviour. The
position control usually consumes the torque resources to ensure the position

strategy based on the force control to maximize the output torque of the
actuator and realize the continuous hopping motion with natural dynamics. The
proposed strategy is able to maximize the saturation ratio of motor and thus
maximize the foot clearance of the single leg. The dynamics of the two-mass

seldom explicitly consider the local consistency at frame level and global

Convolutional Transformer based Dual Discriminator Generative Adversarial

self-attention module to encode the temporal dynamics, and a convolutional
decoder to integrate spatio-temporal features and predict the future frame.
Next, a dual discriminator based adversarial training procedure, which jointly
considers an image discriminator that can maintain the local consistency at
frame-level and a video discriminator that can enforce the global coherence of
temporal dynamics, is employed to enhance the future frame prediction. Finally,
the prediction error is used to identify abnormal video frames. Thoroughly
empirical studies on three public video anomaly detection datasets, i.e., UCSD

utilizes mathematical spatial graph theory to represent, enumerate, and
identify distinctive 3D topological classes for an abstract engineering system,
given its system architecture (SA) -- its components and interconnections.
Spatial graph diagrams (SGDs) are generated for a given SA from zero to a
specified maximum crossing number. Corresponding Yamada polynomials for all the
planar SGDs are then generated. SGDs are categorized into topological classes,
each of which shares a unique Yamada polynomial. Finally, for each topological
class, one 3D geometric model is generated for an SGD with the fewest
interconnect crossings. Several case studies are shown to illustrate the
different features of our proposed framework. Design guidelines are also
provided for practicing engineers to aid the utilization of this framework for

power divided by the angular velocity $\Omega_*$. This means that the length of
the lever arm of the angular momentum extracted by the photons, relativistic
particles and wind must be on average $c/\Omega_*$, which is known as the light
cylinder radius. Therefore, any deposition of the rotation power within the
light cylinder causes insufficient loss of angular momentum. In this paper, we
investigate two cases of this type of energy release: polar cap acceleration
and Ohmic heating in the magnetospheric current inside the star. As for the
first case, the outer magnetosphere beyond the light cylinder is found to
compensate the insufficient loss of the angular momentum. We argue that the
energy flux coming from the sub-rotating magnetic field lines must be larger
than the solid-angle average value, and as a result, an enhanced energy flux
emanating beyond the light cylinder is observed in different phases in the
light curve from those of emission inside the light cylinder. As for the second
case, the stellar surface rotates more slowly than the stellar interior. We
find that the way the magnetospheric current closes inside the star is linked
to how the angular momentum is transferred inside the star. We obtain numerical
solutions which show that the magnetospheric current inside the star spreads
over the polar cap magnetic flux embedded in the star in such a way that
electromotive force is gained efficiently.

achieved exceptional success. However, many of these deep face recognition
models perform much better in handling frontal faces compared to profile faces.
The major reason for poor performance in handling of profile faces is that it
is inherently difficult to learn pose-invariant deep representations that are
useful for profile face recognition. In this paper, we hypothesize that the
profile face domain possesses a latent connection with the frontal face domain
in a latent feature subspace. We look to exploit this latent connection by
projecting the profile faces and frontal faces into a common latent subspace
and perform verification or retrieval in the latent domain. We leverage a
coupled conditional generative adversarial network (cpGAN) structure to find
the hidden relationship between the profile and frontal images in a latent
common embedding subspace. Specifically, the cpGAN framework consists of two
conditional GAN-based sub-networks, one dedicated to the frontal domain and the
other dedicated to the profile domain. Each sub-network tends to find a
projection that maximizes the pair-wise correlation between the two feature
domains in a common embedding feature subspace. The efficacy of our approach
compared with the state-of-the-art is demonstrated using the CFP, CMU
Multi-PIE, IJB-A, and IJB-C datasets. Additionally, we have also implemented a
coupled convolutional neural network (cpCNN) and an adversarial discriminative
domain adaptation network (ADDA) for profile to frontal face recognition. We
have evaluated the performance of cpCNN and ADDA and compared it with the

cause ion acoustic waves and Langmuir waves due to the net current. This can
lead to multiple harmonic plasma emission in the diffusion region and the
separatrices of reconnection. (2) The perpendicular crescent-shaped EVDFs can

relativity, or at the interface of both. We will mainly discuss the first class
of solutions. Traditionally, models that separately explain either the
matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe or dark matter have been proposed.
However, in the last years there has also been an accreted interest and intense
activity on scenarios able to provide a unified picture of the origin of matter
in the early universe. In this review we discuss some of the main ideas
emphasising primarily those models that have more chances to be experimentally
tested during next years. Moreover, after a general discussion, we will focus
on extensions of the standard model that can also address neutrino masses and
mixing, since this is currently the only evidence of physics beyond the
standard model coming directly from particle physics and it is, therefore,
reasonable they might also provide a solution to the problem of the origin of
matter in the universe.

usage of English-Arabic word embedding simplifies the overall pipeline and

  Loss",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The goal of information retrieval is to recommend a list of document
candidates that are most relevant to a given query. Listwise learning trains
neural retrieval models by comparing various candidates simultaneously on a
large scale, offering much more competitive performance than pairwise and
pointwise schemes. Existing listwise ranking losses treat the candidate
document list as a whole unit without further inspection. Some candidates with
moderate semantic prominence may be ignored by the noisy similarity signals or
overshadowed by a few especially pronounced candidates. As a result, existing
ranking losses fail to exploit the full potential of neural retrieval models.
To address these concerns, we apply the classic pooling technique to conduct
multi-level coarse graining and propose ExpertRank, a novel expert-based
listwise ranking loss. The proposed scheme has three major advantages: (1)
ExpertRank introduces the profound physics concept of coarse graining to
information retrieval by selecting prominent candidates at various local levels
based on model prediction and inter-document comparison. (2) ExpertRank applies
the mixture of experts (MoE) technique to combine different experts effectively
by extending the traditional ListNet. (3) Compared to other existing listwise
learning approaches, ExpertRank produces much more reliable and competitive
performance for various neural retrieval models with different complexities,
from traditional models, such as KNRM, ConvKNRM, MatchPyramid, to sophisticated

the light emitted by the two SiPMs considered as photo-sensor candidates for

and one Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (HPK) VUV4 Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC).
Spectral measurements of their light emission were taken with varying
over-voltage in the wavelength range of 450--1020\,nm. For the FBK VUV-HD3, at
an over-voltage of $12.1\pm1.0$\,V, we measure a secondary photon yield (number
of photons ($\gamma$) emitted per charge carrier ($e^{-}$)) of
$(4.04\pm0.02)\times 10^{-6}$ $\gamma/e^{-}$. The emission spectrum of the FBK
VUV-HD3 contains an interference pattern consistent with thin-film
interference. Additionally, emission microscopy images (EMMIs) of the FBK
VUV-HD3 show a small number of highly localized regions with increased light
intensity (hotspots) randomly distributed over the SiPM surface area. For the
HPK VUV4 MPPC, at an over-voltage of $10.7\pm1.0$\,V, we measure a secondary
photon yield of $(8.71\pm0.04)\times 10^{-6}$ $\gamma/e^{-}$. In contrast to
the FBK VUV-HD3, the emission spectra of the HPK VUV4 don't show an
interference pattern -- most likely due to a thinner surface coating. EMMIs of
the HPK VUV4 also reveal a larger number of hotspots compared to the FBK

this infrastructure, experiments with four volunteers were conducted. We
compare 3rd, 4th-, and 5th-generation cellular networks (release 15) with
respect to transmission latency, data corruption, and duration of machine
learning inference. The best performance is achieved using 5G showing an
average transmission latency of 110ms and data corruption in 0.07% of ECG

Future 5G releases will introduce multi-access edge computing (MEC) as a

fields along the cubic [001] and [011] directions, we argue a helical structure
with a basal plane tilted from the (001) plane in low-field ordering region
under the assumption of a helical with a propagation vector of (0, 0, 1/3)
found in other RBe13 compounds (R = rare earths). Such a tilted helical
structure is explained by a combination of an ellipse helical in the (001)
plane and a longitudinal magnetic density wave along the [001] direction.
Considering a magnetic easy axis parallel to [001] revealed by the
magnetization measurements, the peculiar helical structure in SmBe13 may be
built on delicate balance among exchange interactions, dipole-dipole
interaction, and single-ion magnetic anisotropy due to the crystalline electric
field.

hybrid excitons is manifested in the optical anomalous valley Hall effect,
which can be observed via recently developed pump-probe photoemission

one half of that for bright excitons. Moreover, the anticipated long lifetime

object detection. It estimates depth dependent on heights, which introduces
mathematical priors into the deep model. But projection process also introduces
the error amplification problem, in which the error of the estimated height
will be amplified and reflected greatly at the output depth. This property
leads to uncontrollable depth inferences and also damages the training
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network
(GUP Net) to tackle the error amplification problem at both inference and
training stages. Specifically, a GUP module is proposed to obtains the
geometry-guided uncertainty of the inferred depth, which not only provides high
reliable confidence for each depth but also benefits depth learning.
Furthermore, at the training stage, we propose a Hierarchical Task Learning
strategy to reduce the instability caused by error amplification. This learning
algorithm monitors the learning situation of each task by a proposed indicator
and adaptively assigns the proper loss weights for different tasks according to
their pre-tasks situation. Based on that, each task starts learning only when
its pre-tasks are learned well, which can significantly improve the stability

effectiveness of the proposed method. The overall model can infer more reliable

involves multiple aspects: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and
co-learning. In the current state of multimodal machine learning, the
assumptions are that all modalities are present, aligned, and noiseless during
training and testing time. However, in real-world tasks, typically, it is
observed that one or more modalities are missing, noisy, lacking annotated
data, have unreliable labels, and are scarce in training or testing and or
both. This challenge is addressed by a learning paradigm called multimodal
co-learning. The modeling of a (resource-poor) modality is aided by exploiting
knowledge from another (resource-rich) modality using transfer of knowledge
between modalities, including their representations and predictive models.
Co-learning being an emerging area, there are no dedicated reviews explicitly

We compute posteriors for model parameters describing the central engine (e.g.
spin frequency at birth, magnetic field strength) and shock acceleration (e.g.

due to depth ambiguities and occlusions. Nonetheless, most existing works
ignore these ambiguities and only estimate a single solution. In contrast, we
generate a diverse set of hypotheses that represents the full posterior
distribution of feasible 3D poses. To this end, we propose a normalizing flow
based method that exploits the deterministic 3D-to-2D mapping to solve the
ambiguous inverse 2D-to-3D problem. Additionally, uncertain detections and
occlusions are effectively modeled by incorporating uncertainty information of
the 2D detector as condition. Further keys to success are a learned 3D pose
prior and a generalization of the best-of-M loss. We evaluate our approach on
the two benchmark datasets Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, outperforming all
comparable methods in most metrics. The implementation is available on GitHub.

graph $K_2$. $G$ is prism-hamiltonian if the prism over $G$ has a Hamilton
cycle. A good even cactus is a connected graph in which every block is either
an edge or an even cycle, and every vertex is contained in at most two blocks.
It is known that good even cacti are prism-hamiltonian. Indeed, showing the
existence of a spanning good even cactus has become one of the most common
techniques in proving prism-hamiltonicity. \v{S}pacapan asked whether having a
spanning good even cactus is equivalent to having a hamiltonian prism for
3-connected planar graphs. In this article we give a negative answer to this
question by showing that there are infinitely many 3-connected planar
prism-hamiltonian graphs that have no spanning good even cactus. We also prove
the existence of an infinite class of 3-connected planar graphs that have a
spanning good even cactus but no spanning good even cactus with maximum degree
three.

Deshmukh, Paul Bogdan","Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning using Fractional Dynamics","14 pages, 3 figures, CDC2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique to learn the control policy for an
agent that interacts with a stochastic environment. In any given state, the
agent takes some action, and the environment determines the probability
distribution over the next state as well as gives the agent some reward. Most
RL algorithms typically assume that the environment satisfies Markov
assumptions (i.e. the probability distribution over the next state depends only
on the current state). In this paper, we propose a model-based RL technique for
a system that has non-Markovian dynamics. Such environments are common in many
real-world applications such as in human physiology, biological systems,
material science, and population dynamics. Model-based RL (MBRL) techniques
typically try to simultaneously learn a model of the environment from the data,
as well as try to identify an optimal policy for the learned model. We propose
a technique where the non-Markovianity of the system is modeled through a
fractional dynamical system. We show that we can quantify the difference in the
performance of an MBRL algorithm that uses bounded horizon model predictive
control from the optimal policy. Finally, we demonstrate our proposed framework
on a pharmacokinetic model of human blood glucose dynamics and show that our
fractional models can capture distant correlations on real-world datasets.

for functional diversity monitoring. While the availability of high-quality
ecological monitoring data is increasing, the quantification of functional
diversity so far requires the identification of species traits, for which data
is harder to obtain. However, the traits that are relevant for the ecological
function of a species also shape its performance in the environment and hence
should be reflected indirectly in its spatio-temporal distribution. Thus it may
be possible to reconstruct these traits from a sufficiently extensive
monitoring dataset. Here we use diffusion maps, a deterministic and de-facto
parameter-free analysis method, to reconstruct a proxy representation of the
species' traits directly from monitoring data and use it to estimate functional
diversity. We demonstrate this approach both with simulated data and real-world
phytoplankton monitoring data from the Baltic sea. We anticipate that wider
application of this approach to existing data could greatly advance the
analysis of changes in functional biodiversity.

photoelectron spectra of argon, particularly in the low kinetic energy region
(0 eV - 5 eV). In our experiment, we use intense linearly polarised 800 nm
laser pulse to ionise Ar from a jet and we record photoelectron energy and
momentum distributions using a reaction microscope (REMI). Our measurements
show that nondipole effect can cause an energy-dependent asymmetry along the
laser propagation direction in the photoelectron energy and momentum spectra.
Model simulation based on time-dependent Dirac equation (TDDE) can reproduce
our measurement results. The electron trajectory analysis based on classical
model reveals that the photoelectron which obtains negative momentum shift
along laser propagation direction is caused by the interplay between the Lorenz
force induced radiation pressure during its free propagation in continuum and
re-scattering by Coulomb potential of the parent ion when it is driven back by
the laser field.

in terms of the presence of bulky, low symmetry and flexible ions, with the
first two factors related to the lattice energy while an entropic effect is
attributed to the latter. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, the
melting points of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate and
1-decyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate were determined and the effect
of the molecular flexibility over the melting point was explicitly computed by
restraining the rotation of dihedral angles in both the solid and the liquid
phase. The rotational flexibility over the bond between the ring and the alkyl
chain affects the relative ordering of the anions around the cations and
results in substantial effects over both the enthalpy and the entropy of
melting. For the other dihedral angles of the alkyl group, the contributions
are predominantly entropic and an alternating behavior was found. The
flexibility of some dihedral angles has negligible effects on the melting
point, while others can lead to differences in the melting point as large as 20
K. This alternating behavior is rationalized by the different probabilities of
conformation defects in the crystal.

the search for transient gravitational-wave signals with less well-defined
waveforms for which matched filtering is not well-suited is one of the
frontiers for gravitational-wave astronomy. Broadly classified into ""short"" $
\lesssim 1~$\,s and ""long"" $ \gtrsim 1~$\,s duration signals, these signals are
expected from a variety of astrophysical processes, including non-axisymmetric
deformations in magnetars or eccentric binary black hole coalescences. In this
work, we present a search for long-duration gravitational-wave transients from
Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's third observing run from April 2019 to March
2020. For this search, we use minimal assumptions for the sky location, event
time, waveform morphology, and duration of the source. The search covers the
range of $2~\text{--}~ 500$~s in duration and a frequency band of $24 - 2048$
Hz. We find no significant triggers within this parameter space; we report
sensitivity limits on the signal strength of gravitational waves characterized
by the root-sum-square amplitude $h_{\mathrm{rss}}$ as a function of waveform
morphology. These $h_{\mathrm{rss}}$ limits improve upon the results from the
second observing run by an average factor of 1.8.

supporting decentralized collaborative learning scenarios. Among existing FL
models, federated logistic regression (FLR) is a widely used statistic model
and has been used in various industries. To ensure data security and user
privacy, FLR leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) to protect the exchanged
data among different collaborative parties. However, HE introduces significant
computational overhead (i.e., the cost of data encryption/decryption and
calculation over encrypted data), which eventually becomes the performance
bottleneck of the whole system. In this paper, we propose HAFLO, a GPU-based
solution to improve the performance of FLR. The core idea of HAFLO is to
summarize a set of performance-critical homomorphic operators (HO) used by FLR
and accelerate the execution of these operators through a joint optimization of
storage, IO, and computation. The preliminary results show that our
acceleration on FATE, a popular FL framework, achieves a 49.9$\times$ speedup
for heterogeneous LR and 88.4$\times$ for homogeneous LR.

We found that the statistical correlations are in good agreement with Maxwell's
effective medium theory, despite large scatter in the data. The thermal
conductivity increases linearly with concentration, and in the case of
carbon-nanotubes with temperature, whereas the nanoparticle size shows
significant influence for alumina and titania. The large scatter in the

  Task Assistance",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Supernumerary Robotics Device (SRD) is an ideal solution to provide robotic
assistance in overhead manual manipulation. Since two arms are occupied for the
overhead task, it is desired to have additional arms to assist us in achieving
other subtasks such as supporting the far end of a long plate and pushing it
upward to fit in the ceiling. In this study, a method that maps human muscle
force to SRD for overhead task assistance is proposed. Our methodology is to
utilize redundant DoFs such as the idle muscles in the leg to control the
supporting force of the SRD. A sEMG device is worn on the operator's shank
where muscle signals are measured, parsed, and transmitted to SRD for control.
In the control aspect, we adopted stiffness control in the task space based on
torque control at the joint level. We are motivated by the fact that humans can
achieve daily manipulation merely through simple inherent compliance property
in joint driven by muscles. We explore to estimate the force of some particular
muscles in humans and control the SRD to imitate the behaviors of muscle and
output supporting forces to accomplish the subtasks such as overhead
supporting. The sEMG signals detected from human muscles are extracted,
filtered, rectified, and parsed to estimate the muscle force. We use this force
information as the intent of the operator for proper overhead supporting force.
As one of the well-known compliance control methods, stiffness control is easy
to achieve using a few of straightforward parameters such as stiffness and
equilibrium point. Through tuning the stiffness and equilibrium point, the
supporting force of SRD in task space can be easily controlled. The muscle
force estimated by sEMG is mapped to the desired force in the task space of the
SRD. The desired force is transferred into stiffness or equilibrium point to
output the corresponding supporting force.

goals of scene understanding. Due to the advantages of task interaction, many
works study the joint task learning algorithm. However, most existing methods
fail to fully leverage the semantic labels, ignoring the provided context
structures and only using them to supervise the prediction of segmentation
split, which limit the performance of both tasks. In this paper, we propose a
network injected with contextual information (CI-Net) to solve the problem.
Specifically, we introduce self-attention block in the encoder to generate
attention map. With supervision from the ideal attention map created by
semantic label, the network is embedded with contextual information so that it
could understand scene better and utilize correlated features to make accurate
prediction. Besides, a feature sharing module is constructed to make the
task-specific features deeply fused and a consistency loss is devised to make
the features mutually guided. We evaluate the proposed CI-Net on the
NYU-Depth-v2 and SUN-RGBD datasets. The experimental results validate that our
proposed CI-Net could effectively improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation

is embodied in both the image guidance branch and depth generation branch. In
the former branch, we design a repetitive hourglass network to extract
discriminative image features of complex environments, which can provide
powerful contextual instruction for depth prediction. In the latter branch, we
introduce a repetitive guidance module based on dynamic convolution, in which
an efficient convolution factorization is proposed to simultaneously reduce its

constraints and promise detectable signals at future colliders. Prospects for
observing pair-production of the IDM scalars at CLIC were previously studied
using signatures with two leptons in the final state. In the current study,
discovery reach for the IDM charged scalar pair-production is considered for
the semi-leptonic final state at the two high-energy CLIC stages. Full
simulation analysis, based on the current CLIC detector model, is presented for
five selected IDM scenarios. Results are then extended to the larger set of
benchmarks using the Delphes fast simulation framework. The CLIC detector model
for Delphes has been modified to take pile-up contribution from the
beam-induced $\gamma\gamma$ interactions into account, which is crucial for the
presented analysis. Results of the study indicate that heavy, charged IDM
scalars can be discovered at CLIC for most of the proposed benchmark scenarios,
with very high statistical significance.

a scalar field. The scalar field is assumed to be shift symmetric, and hence
the conformal and disformal factors of the metric coupled to matter are
dependent only on the kinetic term of the scalar field. Assuming that the
scalar field is linearly dependent on time, we consider a general
shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theory and a general form of the matter
energy-momentum tensor that allows for the anisotropic pressure and the heat
flux in the radial direction. This is a natural starting point in light of how
the gravitational field equations and the energy-momentum tensor transform
under a disformal transformation. By inspecting the structure of the
hydrostatic equilibrium equation in the presence of the derivative-dependent
conformal and disformal factors, we show that the energy density and tangential
pressure must vanish at the surface of a star. This fact is used to prove the
disformal invariance of the surface of a star, which was previously subtle and
unclear. We then focus on the shift-symmetric k-essence disformally coupled to
matter, and study the interior and exterior metric functions and scalar-field
profile in more detail. It is found that there are two branches of the solution
depending on the velocity of the scalar field. The disformally-related metric

employs a feature refinement (FR) module that incorporates
\textit{semantic$\rightarrow$visual} mapping into a unified generative model to
refine the visual features of seen and unseen class samples. Furthermore, we
propose a self-adaptive margin center loss (SAMC-loss) that cooperates with a
semantic cycle-consistency loss to guide FR to learn class- and
semantically-relevant representations, and concatenate the features in FR to
extract the fully refined features. Extensive experiments on five benchmark

non-edge), 1 (an edge) or $\star$ (both an edge and a non-edge). In a series of
papers, Hell et al. proposed to study the complexity of homomorphisms from
graphs to trigraphs, called Matrix Partition Problems, where edges and
non-edges can be both mapped to $\star$-edges, while a non-edge cannot be
mapped to an edge, and vice-versa. Even though, Matrix Partition Problems are
generalisations of CSPs, they share with them the property of being
""intrinsically"" combinatorial. So, the question of a possible dichotomy, i.e.
P-time vs NP-complete, is a very natural one and raised in Hell et al.'s
papers. We propose in this paper to study Matrix Partition Problems on
relational structures, wrt a dichotomy question, and, in particular,
homomorphisms between trigraphs. We first show that trigraph homomorphisms and
Matrix Partition Problems are P-time equivalent, and then prove that one can
also restrict (wrt dichotomy) to relational structures with one relation.
Failing in proving that Matrix Partition Problems on directed graphs are not
P-time equivalent to Matrix Partitions on relational structures, we give some
evidence that it is unlikely by showing that reductions used in the case of
CSPs cannot work. We turn then our attention to Matrix Partitions with finite
sets of obstructions. We show that, for a fixed trigraph, the set of
inclusion-wise minimal obstructions is finite for directed graphs if and only
if it is finite for trigraphs. We also prove similar results for relational
structures. We conclude by showing that on trees (seen as trigraphs) it is
NP-complete to decide whether a given tree has a trigraph homomorphism to
another input trigraph. The latter shows a notable difference on tractability
between CSP and Matrix Partition as it is well-known that CSP is tractable on
the class of trees.

magnetic frustration in the ground state. Our findings provide a novel material

In this paper, we resolve this paradox by introducing consecutive images (\eg,
video frames or the same person with different poses) into the inversion
process. The rationale behind our solution is that the continuity of
consecutive images leads to inherent editable directions. This inborn property
is used for two unique purposes: 1) regularizing the joint inversion process,
such that each of the inverted code is semantically accessible from one of the
other and fastened in a editable domain; 2) enforcing inter-image coherence,
such that the fidelity of each inverted code can be maximized with the
complement of other images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
alternative significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
reconstruction fidelity and editability on both the real image dataset and

attracted great research attention and many iteration-based distributed

determined by the network structure and is hardly pre-tuned, making the
iterative-based distributed algorithms may converge very slowly when the
spectral radius is close to 1. In contrast, in centralized optimization, the
Conjugate Gradient (CG) is a widely adopted idea to speed up the convergence of
the centralized solvers, which can guarantee convergence in fixed steps. In
this paper, we propose a general distributed implementation of CG, called DCG.
DCG only needs local communication and local computation, while inheriting the
characteristic of fast convergence. DCG guarantees to converge in $4Hn$ rounds,

sphaleron process in the baryogenesis scenario is calculated. It always
satisfies the de-coupling condition and the strength of phase transition ($S$)
is always greater than $1$ in the presence of triggers other than that in the
Standard Model, which are singly ($h^{\pm}$) and doubly ($k^{\pm\pm}$) charged
scalar bosons. Sphaleron energies are in the range of 5-10 TeV, in calculation
with bubble profiles containing free parameters and assuming nuclear bubbles of
$h^{\pm}$ and $k^{\pm\pm}$ are very small. We tested the scaling law of
sphaleron again with an average error of $10\%$. When the temperature is close
to the critical one ($T_c$), the density of nuclear bubble is produced very
large and decreases as the temperature decreases. The key parameter is $\alpha$
which results in the gravitational wave density parameter ($\Omega h^2$) in the
range of $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-12}$ when $\beta/H^*=22.5$, this is not enough to
detect gravitational waves from electroweak phase transition (EWPT) according
to the present LISA data but may be detected in the future. As the larger
strength of phase transition is, the more $\alpha$ increases (this increase is
almost linear with $S$), the larger the gravitational wave density parameter
is. Also in the context of considering the generation of gravitational waves,
in the ZB model we calculated $\alpha \sim \text{a few} \times 10^{-2}\ll 1$,
so rigorously conclude that the EWPT is not strong even though $S>1$. We also
suggest that, for a model with a lot of extra scalar particles and particles
which play a role in mass generation, the stronger the EWPT process and the
larger $\Omega h^2$ can be.

Nevertheless, being oblivious to the underlying geometry, voxel-based methods
suffer from ambiguous features on spatially close objects and struggle with
handling complex and irregular geometries due to the lack of geodesic
information. In view of this, we present Voxel-Mesh Network (VMNet), a novel 3D
deep architecture that operates on the voxel and mesh representations
leveraging both the Euclidean and geodesic information. Intuitively, the
Euclidean information extracted from voxels can offer contextual cues
representing interactions between nearby objects, while the geodesic
information extracted from meshes can help separate objects that are spatially
close but have disconnected surfaces. To incorporate such information from the
two domains, we design an intra-domain attentive module for effective feature
aggregation and an inter-domain attentive module for adaptive feature fusion.
Experimental results validate the effectiveness of VMNet: specifically, on the
challenging ScanNet dataset for large-scale segmentation of indoor scenes, it
outperforms the state-of-the-art SparseConvNet and MinkowskiNet (74.6% vs 72.5%

aspects of this system include the capacity to display high-resolution kinetic
friction patterns, the ability to algorithmically define interactions directly

  A prototype interaction spatially mapping arbitrary 1D signal data on a

across the surface is described. The results of a pilot evaluation of this
interaction indicate how kinetic surface friction rendering can be a means for
giving dynamically created virtual objects for sonification a tangible

are identified, as well as issues to be considered when applying and further
developing this type of haptic feedback in the context of interactive

suitably forced $s$-fractional heat flows converge, as $s\to 0^+$\,, to the
parabolic flow of an energy functional that can be seen as a sort of

the first variation of such an energy, that can be understood as a zero (or

accurate property models. Direct atomic-scale imaging observations with high
angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy,
complemented by phase-field modeling informed by generalized stacking fault
surface calculations using density functional theory, were employed to
understand the shear process of ${\gamma}''$ and ${\gamma}'/{\gamma}''$
co-precipitates after 1 \% macroscopic strain at lower temperature (ambient and
$427 {\deg}C$). Experimentally, intrinsic stacking faults were observed in the
${\gamma}''$, whereas the ${\gamma}'$ was found to exhibit anti-phase
boundaries or superlattice intrinsic stacking faults. Additionally, the
atomically flat ${\gamma}'/{\gamma}''$ interfaces in the co-precipitates were
found to exhibit offsets after shearing, which can be used as tracers for the
deformation events. Phase-field modeling shows that the developing
fault-structure is dependent on the direction of the Burgers vector of the $a/2
\langle110\rangle$ matrix dislocation (or dislocation group) due to the lower
crystal symmetry of the ${\gamma''}$ phase. The interplay between ${\gamma}'$

co-precipitate and increases the shear resistance. Consistent with the
experimental observations, the simulation results indicate that complex
shearing mechanisms are active in the low-temperature deformation regime and

of upstream perturbations and make the downstream turbine experience strong
inflow fluctuations. In this work, we investigate the effects of the
side-to-side motion of a floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) on wake dynamics
using large-eddy simulation and linear stability analysis (LSA) on the NREL 5MW
baseline offshore wind turbine. Simulation results reveal that the turbine
motion can lead to wake meandering for motion frequencies with the Strouhal
number $St = fD/U_\infty \in (0.2,0.6)$ (where $f$ is the motion frequency, $D$
is the rotor diameter, and $U_\infty$ is the incoming wind speed), which lie in
the range of the natural roll frequencies of common FOWT designs. This
complements the existing wake meandering mechanism, that the side-to-side
motion of a FOWT can be a novel origin for the onset of wake meandering. The
amplitude of the induced wake meandering can be one order of magnitude higher
than the initial perturbation for the most unstable frequencies. The
probability density function of the spanwise location of the instantaneous wake
centers is observed having two peaks on the time-averaged wake boundaries and a
trough near the time-averaged wake centerline, respectively. It is also found
that the LSA can predict the least stable frequencies and the amplification
factor with acceptable accuracy for motion amplitude $0.01D$. Effects of
non-linearity are observed when motion amplitude increases to $0.04D$, for
which the most unstable turbine oscillations shift slightly to lower
frequencies and the amplification factor decreases.

DM models with light mediator. Next, we investigate how to account for the DM
relic abundance in such portal models which present a generic structure with
three populations (Standard Model, DM and mediator particles) connected to each

appears that this can be done through five different dynamical ways which give
rise to nine regimes among which four are new. Those new production regimes are
relevant for a situation where the hidden sector particles are not thermally
connected to the visible vector particles. We further study the possibility of
a thermally disconnected Hidden Sector and establish the general allowed
parameter space for DM thermal candidates in the hidden-to-visible temperature
ratio versus DM mass plane. We show that, in this framework, simple portal
models such as the two we consider can alleviate tensions at small scale while
offering suitable DM candidates. Other minimal self-interacting DM with light

multiple dancers and temporal alignment of their movements. The system then
highlights which body parts and which portions of the dance routine require
further practice to achieve better synchronization. The results of our system

and key-value stores, are increasingly demanding larger main memory to fit
their working sets. Conventional swapping can enlarge the memory capacity by
paging out inactive pages to disks. However, the heavy I/O stack makes the
traditional kernel-based swapping suffers from several critical performance
issues.
  In this paper, we redesign the swapping system and propose LightSwap, an
high-performance user-space swapping scheme that supports paging with both
local SSDs and remote memories. First, to avoids kernel-involving, a novel page
fault handling mechanism is proposed to handle page faults in user-space and
further eliminates the heavy I/O stack with the help of user-space I/O drivers.
Second, we co-design Lightswap with light weight thread (LWT) to improve system
throughput and make it be transparent to user applications. Finally, we propose
a try-catch framework in Lightswap to deal with paging errors which are
exacerbated by the scaling in process technology.
  We implement Lightswap in our production-level system and evaluate it with
YCSB workloads running on memcached. Results show that Ligthswap reduces the
page faults handling latency by 3--5 times, and improves the throughput of
memcached by more than 40% compared with the stat-of-art swapping systems.

problems in point-to-point reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided

exploiting the low-rank nature of mmWave MIMO channels, the received training
signals can be written as a low-rank multi-way tensor admitting a canonical

channel estimation method (termed TenRICE) is proposed, wherein the tensor
factor matrices are estimated using an alternating least squares method. Using
TenRICE, the transmitter-to-RIS and the RIS-to-receiver channels are
efficiently and separately estimated, up to a trivial scaling factor. After
that, we formulate the beamforming and RIS reflection design as a spectral
efficiency maximization problem. Due to its non-convexity, we propose a
heuristic non-iterative two-step method, where the RIS reflection vector is
obtained in a closed form using a Frobenius-norm maximization (FroMax)
strategy. Our numerical results show that TenRICE has a superior performance,
compared to benchmark methods, approaching the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound with a
low training overhead. Moreover, we show that FroMax achieves a comparable
performance to benchmark methods with a lower complexity.

be regarded as boundary value problems for Hamiltonian systems. Variational or
symplectic discretisation methods are classically known for their excellent
long term behaviour. As boundary value problems are posed on intervals of
fixed, moderate length, it is not immediately clear whether methods can profit
from structure preservation in this context. When parameters are present,
solutions can undergo bifurcations, for instance, two solutions can merge and
annihilate one another as parameters are varied. We will show that generic
bifurcations of an OCP are preserved under discretisation when the OCP is
either directly discretised to a discrete OCP (direct method) or translated
into a Hamiltonian boundary value problem using first order necessary
conditions of optimality which is then solved using a symplectic integrator
(indirect method). Moreover, certain bifurcations break when a non-symplectic
scheme is used. The general phenomenon is illustrated on the example of a cut

devices with Ta and Pt, due to the opposite temperature coefficient of
resistivity (TCR) of the two materials. All those results are consistent with
the ""localized Joule heating"" mechanism in devices with Hall crosses geometry.
Moreover, by utilizing a structure with separated writing current paths and
Hall cross area, the quadratic relationship between delta-Rxy and the writing

information is embedded in a carrier using steganography. Most of the existing
steganalytic methods are based on machine learning, which typically requires
training a classifier with ""laboratory"" data. However, applying
machine-learning classification to a new source of data is challenging, since
there is typically a mismatch between the training and the testing sets. In
addition, other sources of uncertainty affect the steganlytic process,
including the mismatch between the targeted and the true steganographic
algorithms, unknown parameters -- such as the message length -- and even having
a mixture of several algorithms and parameters, which would constitute a
realistic scenario. This paper presents subsequent embedding as a valuable
strategy that can be incorporated into modern steganalysis. Although this
solution has been applied in previous works, a theoretical basis for this
strategy was missing. Here, we cover this research gap by introducing the
""directionality"" property of features with respect to data embedding. Once this

customers to personalized lists of products. Approaches to top-k recommendation
mainly rely on Learning-To-Rank algorithms and, among them, the most widely
adopted is Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which bases on a pair-wise
optimization approach. Recently, BPR has been found vulnerable against
adversarial perturbations of its model parameters. Adversarial Personalized
Ranking (APR) mitigates this issue by robustifying BPR via an adversarial
training procedure. The empirical improvements of APR's accuracy performance on
BPR have led to its wide use in several recommender models. However, a key
overlooked aspect has been the beyond-accuracy performance of APR, i.e.,
novelty, coverage, and amplification of popularity bias, considering that
recent results suggest that BPR, the building block of APR, is sensitive to the
intensification of biases and reduction of recommendation novelty. In this
work, we model the learning characteristics of the BPR and APR optimization
frameworks to give mathematical evidence that, when the feedback data have a
tailed distribution, APR amplifies the popularity bias more than BPR due to an
unbalanced number of received positive updates from short-head items. Using
matrix factorization (MF), we empirically validate the theoretical results by
performing preliminary experiments on two public datasets to compare BPR-MF and
APR-MF performance on accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics. The experimental
results consistently show the degradation of novelty and coverage measures and
a worrying amplification of bias.

of individual characteristics of pedestrians on the fundamental diagram. These
studies compared cumulative data on individuals in a group homogeneous in terms

instance gender. In order to examine the effect of all determined as well as
undetermined human factors, individual fundamental diagrams are introduced and
analyzed using multiple linear regression. A single-file school experiment with
students of different age, gender, and height is therefore considered. Single
individuals appearing in different runs are analyzed to study the effect of
human factors such as height, age and gender and all other unknown individual
effects such as motivation or attention to the individual speed. The analysis
shows that for students age and height are strongly correlated and,
consequently, age can be ignored. Furthermore, the study shows that gender has
a weak effect and other nonmeasurable individual characteristics have a
stronger effect than height. In a further step, a mixed model is used as well
as the multiple linear model. Here, it is shown that the mixed model that
considers all other unknown individual effects of each person as a random
factor is preferable to the model where the individual speed only depends on
the variables of headway, height, and all other unknown individual effects as
fixed factors.

matter (DM), red giant branch (RGB) stars and all the rich phenomenology they
encompass have frequently been overlooked by such endeavors. Aims: We study the
capture, evaporation, and annihilation of weakly interacting massive particle
(WIMP) DM in low-mass RGB stars ($M=0.8-1.4~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). Methods: We
used a modified stellar evolution code to study the effects of DM
self-annihilation on the structure and evolution of low-mass RGB stars.
Results: We find that the number of DM particles that accumulate inside
low-mass RGB stars is not only constant during this phase of evolution, but
also mostly independent of the stellar mass and to some extent stellar
metallicity. Moreover, we find that the energy injected into the stellar core
due to DM annihilation can promote the conditions necessary for helium burning
and thus trigger an early end of the RGB phase. The premature end of the RGB,
which is most pronounced for DM particles with $m_\chi \simeq
100~\mathrm{GeV}$, is thus achieved at a lower helium core mass, which results
in a lower luminosity at the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). Although in
the current WIMP paradigm, these effects are only relevant if the number of DM
particles inside the star is extremely large, we find that for light WIMPs
($m_\chi \simeq 4~\mathrm{GeV}$), relevant deviations from the standard TRGB
luminosity ($\sim 8\%$) can be achieved with conditions that can be realistic
in the inner parsec of the Milky Way.

numerically dominant compared to non-perturbative corrections. Here, we present
the perturbative QCD correction to the massless quark-loop and estimate its
size numerically. In particular, we find that for scales above 1 GeV it is
relatively small, in general roughly $-10\%$ the size of the massless

deformation for complex iced geometries. Given the high computational cost of
mesh deformation, state-of-the-art radial basis function techniques are used
for data reduction. The principle procedures adopted are multi-level greedy
surface point selection and volume point reduction. The multi-level greedy
surface point selection reduces the control point list to increase the
efficiency of the interpolation operation and the volume point reduction
improves the computational cost of the volume mesh update operation which is
important for large data sets. The study demonstrates the capabilities of
radial basis function mesh deformation in both two and three-dimensions.
Furthermore, it compares localised ice deformation to more standardized test
cases with global deformation. The convergence history of the multi-level
greedy point selection is assessed in terms of number of control points and
computational cost for all the test cases. The location of the selected control
points near the ice accretion illustrates the effectiveness of the method for
localised deformation. The results show that the radial basis function mesh
deformation performs well for both the two and three-dimensional test cases.
The reduction of the relative surface error for the three-dimensional test
cases understandably requires a larger number of control points and thus
results in a higher computational cost. Nevertheless, the data-reduction
schemes presented in this work represent a significant improvement to standard
radial basis function mesh deformation for three-dimensional aircraft icing

m/s have had their masses directly constrained. The biggest obstacle to RV
detection of such exoplanets is variability intrinsic to stars themselves, e.g.
nuisance signals arising from surface magnetic activity such as rotating spots
and plages, which can drown out or even mimic planetary RV signals. We use
Kepler-37 - known to host three transiting planets, one of which, Kepler-37d,
should be on the cusp of RV detectability with modern spectrographs - as a case
study in disentangling planetary and stellar activity signals. We show how two
different statistical techniques - one seeking to identify activity signals in
stellar spectra, and another to model activity signals in extracted RVs and
activity indicators - can enable detection of the hitherto elusive Kepler-37d.
Moreover, we show that these two approaches can be complementary, and in
combination, facilitate a definitive detection and precise characterisation of
Kepler-37d. Its RV semi-amplitude of $1.22\pm0.31$ m/s (mass $5.4\pm1.4$
$M_\oplus$) is formally consistent with TOI-178b's $1.05^{+0.25}_{-0.30}$ m/s,
the latter being the smallest detected RV signal of any transiting planet to
date, though dynamical simulations suggest Kepler-37d's mass may be on the
lower end of our $1\sigma$ credible interval. Its consequent density is
consistent with either a water-world or that of a gaseous envelope ($\sim0.4\%$
by mass) surrounding a rocky core. Based on RV modelling and a re-analysis of
Kepler-37 TTVs, we also argue that the putative (non-transiting) planet
Kepler-37e should probably be stripped of its 'confirmed' status.

introduced in the source code by creating and running unit tests. Despite their
importance, unit tests are subject to bad design or implementation decisions,
the so-called test smells. These might decrease software systems quality from
various aspects, making it harder to understand, more complex to maintain, and
more prone to errors and bugs. Many studies discuss the likely effects of test
smells on test code. However, there is a lack of studies that capture
developers perceptions of such issues. This study empirically analyzes how
developers perceive the severity of test smells in the test code they develop.
Severity refers to the degree to how a test smell may negatively impact the
test code. We selected six open-source software projects from GitHub and
interviewed their developers to understand whether and how the test smells
affected the test code. Although most of the interviewed developers considered
the test smells as having a low severity to their code, they indicated that
test smells might negatively impact the project, particularly in test code
maintainability and evolution. Also, detecting and removing test smells from
the test code may be positive for the project.

non-overlapping camera views. The majority of Re-ID methods focus on
small-scale surveillance systems in which each pedestrian is captured in
different camera views of adjacent scenes. However, in large-scale surveillance
systems that cover larger areas, it is required to track a pedestrian of
interest across distant scenes (e.g., a criminal suspect escapes from one city
to another). Since most pedestrians appear in limited local areas, it is
difficult to collect training data with cross-camera pairs of the same person.
In this work, we study intra-camera supervised person re-identification across
distant scenes (ICS-DS Re-ID), which uses cross-camera unpaired data with
intra-camera identity labels for training. It is challenging as cross-camera
paired data plays a crucial role for learning camera-invariant features in most
existing Re-ID methods. To learn camera-invariant representation from
cross-camera unpaired training data, we propose a cross-camera feature
prediction method to mine cross-camera self supervision information from
camera-specific feature distribution by transforming fake cross-camera positive
feature pairs and minimize the distances of the fake pairs. Furthermore, we
automatically localize and extract local-level feature by a transformer. Joint
learning of global-level and local-level features forms a global-local
cross-camera feature prediction scheme for mining fine-grained cross-camera
self supervision information. Finally, cross-camera self supervision and
intra-camera supervision are aggregated in a framework. The experiments are
conducted in the ICS-DS setting on Market-SCT, Duke-SCT and MSMT17-SCT
datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate the superiority of our method,
which gains significant improvements of 15.4 Rank-1 and 22.3 mAP on Market-SCT

contain nonlinear high order derivatives, and possibly peakon solutions or

as a hyperbolic-elliptic system, and the \mdp equation as a first order system.
Then we choose a linear finite difference scheme with suitable order of
accuracy for the auxiliary variable(s), and two finite difference WENO schemes
with unequal-sized sub-stencils for the primal variable. One WENO scheme uses
one large stencil and several smaller stencils, and the other WENO scheme is

uses several small stencils of the same size to make up a big stencil, both

stencil and enjoy the freedom of arbitrary positive linear weights. Another
advantage is that the final reconstructed polynomial on the target cell is a
polynomial of the same degree as the polynomial over the big stencil, while the
classical finite difference WENO reconstruction can only be obtained for
specific points inside the target interval. Numerical tests are provided to
demonstrate the high order accuracy and non-oscillatory properties of the

alone can measure $H_0$ with a precision of 2.1\%, which is sufficient to
arbitrate the Hubble tension. Combining current most precise electromagnetic
experiments, the inclusion of AEDGE bright sirens can improve the measurement
of the equation of state of dark energy, though marginally. Moreover, by
modifying GW propagation on cosmological scales, the deviations from general
relativity (modified gravity theory effects) can be constrained at 5.7\%

probabilistic approach for the analysis of preference data expressed through
paired comparison rankings. In some cases, it may be reasonable to assume that
the preferences expressed by individuals depend on their characteristics.
Within the framework of tree-based partitioning, we specify a tree-based model
estimating the joint effects of subject-specific covariates over and above
their main effects. We combine a tree-based model and the log-linear
Bradley-Terry model using the outcome of the comparisons as response variable.
The proposed model provides a solution to discover interaction effects when no
a-priori hypotheses are available. It produces a small tree, called trunk, that
represents a fair compromise between a simple interpretation of the interaction
effects and an easy to read partition of judges based on their characteristics
and the preferences they have expressed. We present an application on a real
data set following two different approaches, and a simulation study to test the
model's performance. Simulations showed that the quality of the model
performance increases when the number of rankings and objects increases. In
addition, the performance is considerably amplified when the judges'
characteristics have a high impact on their choices.

Subsequently, the general model is optimized for the specific situation at

crackling-like small ones. In contrast, systems consisting of particles with
small roughness display no detectable avalanches. The stress drop of
quasi-periodic avalanche shows a linear relation with the correlation length of
particle non-affine displacement, suggesting that roughness enhances
inter-particle locking and hence particle-level dynamic correlation length.
However, the nonaffine displacement is two orders of magnitude smaller than
particle size, indicating that stress is mainly released on the length scale of
roughness. The correlation length of non-affine displacements abruptly
increases when a quasi-periodic avalanche occurs, suggesting that
quasi-periodic avalanches can be interpreted as a spinodal nucleation event in
a first-order phase transition.

progress in recent years. However, monocular 3D object detection remains a
challenging problem due to the unsatisfactory performance in depth estimation.
Most existing monocular methods typically directly regress the scene depth
while ignoring important relationships between the depth and various geometric
elements (e.g. bounding box sizes, 3D object dimensions, and object poses). In
this paper, we propose to learn geometry-guided depth estimation with
projective modeling to advance monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, a
principled geometry formula with projective modeling of 2D and 3D depth
predictions in the monocular 3D object detection network is devised. We further
implement and embed the proposed formula to enable geometry-aware deep
representation learning, allowing effective 2D and 3D interactions for boosting
the depth estimation. Moreover, we provide a strong baseline through addressing
substantial misalignment between 2D annotation and projected boxes to ensure
robust learning with the proposed geometric formula. Experiments on the KITTI
dataset show that our method remarkably improves the detection performance of
the state-of-the-art monocular-based method without extra data by 2.80% on the
moderate test setting. The model and code will be released at

hypergraph and hypergraph model visualizations and assesses the currently
employed techniques. We provide an overview and a categorization of proposed
approaches, focusing on performance, scalability, interaction support,
successful evaluation, and the ability to represent different underlying data
structures, including a recent demand for a temporal representation of
interaction networks and their improvements beyond graph-based methods. Lastly,
we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches and give an insight
into the future challenges arising in this emerging research field.

predictions for intermediate measurements made on pre- and post-selected
systems. Although in principle those effects can be explained by measurement
disturbance, it is not clear what mechanisms are required to fully account for
the observed correlations. In this paper, this paradox is scrutinised from the
causal point of view. We consider an array of potential causal structures
behind the experiment, eliminating those without enough explanatory power. This
gives a means of differentiating between the various mechanisms in which
measurement disturbance can propagate in the system. Specifically, we
distinguish whether it is just the measurement outcome or the full measurement
context that is required for the causal explanation of the observed statistics.
We show that the latter is indispensable, but only when the full statistics is
taken into account (which includes checking the third box too). Furthermore, we
discuss the realism assumption which posits the existence of preexisting values
revealed by measurements. It is shown that in this case measurement disturbance
is necessary. Interestingly, without the realism assumption, the original
version of the paradox (with just two boxes considered for inspection) can be
explained without resorting to any measurement disturbance. These various
results illustrate the richness of the paradox which is better appreciated from
the causal perspective.

optimal policies for a variety of sequential decision-making tasks. However, in
many real-world RL problems, besides optimizing the main objectives, the agent
is expected to satisfy a certain level of safety (e.g., avoiding collisions in
autonomous driving). While RL problems are commonly formalized as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), safety constraints are incorporated via constrained
Markov decision processes (CMDPs). Although recent advances in safe RL have
enabled learning safe policies in CMDPs, these safety requirements should be
satisfied during both training and in the deployment process. Furthermore, it
is shown that in memory-based and partially observable environments, these
methods fail to maintain safety over unseen out-of-distribution observations.
To address these limitations, we propose a Lyapunov-based uncertainty-aware
safe RL model. The introduced model adopts a Lyapunov function that converts
trajectory-based constraints to a set of local linear constraints. Furthermore,
to ensure the safety of the agent in highly uncertain environments, an
uncertainty quantification method is developed that enables identifying
risk-averse actions through estimating the probability of constraint
violations. Moreover, a Transformers model is integrated to provide the agent
with memory to process long time horizons of information via the self-attention
mechanism. The proposed model is evaluated in grid-world navigation tasks where
safety is defined as avoiding static and dynamic obstacles in fully and
partially observable environments. The results of these experiments show a
significant improvement in the performance of the agent both in achieving
optimality and satisfying safety constraints.

a form of social interaction by which individuals tend to establish links with

has been long ago characterized for pure bipartite states, the situation is
drastically different for systems of more parties: generic pure qudit-states
cannot be obtained from nor transformed to any state, which contains a
different amount of entanglement. We consider here the question of LOCC
convertibility for permutation-symmetric pure states of an arbitrary number of
parties and local dimension, a class of clear interest both for physical and
mathematical reasons and for which the aforementioned result does not apply
given that it is a zero-measure subset in the state space. While it turns out
that this situation persists for generic n-qubit symmetric states, we consider
particular families for which we can determine that on the contrary they are
endorsed with a rich local stabilizer, a necessary requirement for LOCC
convertibility to be possible. This allows us to identify classes in which LOCC
transformations among permutation-symmetric states are possible.
Notwithstanding, we provide several results that indicate severe obstructions
to LOCC convertibility in general even within these highly symmetrical classes.
The only classes found for which every state can be converted to a more weakly
entangled state are the n-qubit GHZ and W classes. In the course of the study
of LOCC transformations we also characterize the local symmetries of symmetric
states.

incompressible fluid turbulence, and estimate the scale at which they become
important. As anticipated by Betchov in a prescient series of works more than
six decades ago, this scale is about equal to the Kolmogorov length, even
though that is several orders of magnitude above the mean free path. This
result implies that the deterministic version of the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equation is inadequate to describe the dissipation range of
turbulence in molecular fluids. Within this range, the fluctuating
hydrodynamics equation of Landau and Lifschitz is more appropriate. In
particular, our analysis implies that both the exponentially decaying energy
spectrum and the far-dissipation range intermittency predicted by Kraichnan for
deterministic Navier-Stokes will be generally replaced by Gaussian thermal
equipartition at scales just below the Kolmogorov length. Stochastic shell
model simulations at high Reynolds numbers verify our theoretical predictions
and reveal furthermore that inertial-range intermittency can propagate deep
into the dissipation range, leading to large fluctuations in the equipartition
length scale. We explain the failure of previous scaling arguments for the
validity of deterministic Navier-Stokes equations at any Reynolds number and we
provide a mathematical interpretation and physical justification of the
fluctuating Navier-Stokes equation as an ``effective field-theory'' valid below
some high-wavenumber cutoff $\Lambda$, rather than as a continuum stochastic
partial differential equation. At Reynolds number around a million the
strongest turbulent excitations observed in our simulation penetrate down to a
length-scale of microns. However, for longer observation times or higher
Reynolds numbers, more extreme turbulent events could lead to a local breakdown
of fluctuating hydrodynamics.

cost-effectiveness of oral iron supplements. Electronic health records (EHRs)
from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) provide rich longitudinal
data on IDA disease progression in patients registered with 663 General
Practitioner (GP) practices in the UK, but they also create challenges in
statistical analyses. First, the CPRD data are clustered at multi-levels (i.e.,
GP practices and patients), but their large volume makes it computationally
difficult to implement estimation of standard random effects models for
multi-level data. Second, observation times in the CPRD data are irregular and
could be informative about the disease progression. For example, shorter/longer
gap times between GP visits could be associated with deteriorating/improving
IDA. Existing methods to address informative observation times are mostly based
on complex joint models, which adds more computational burden. To tackle these
challenges, we develop a computationally efficient approach to modelling
disease progression with EHRs data while accounting for variability at
multi-level clusters and informative observation times. We apply the proposed
method to the CPRD data to investigate IDA improvement and treatment

study of artefacts and related evidence. Current practice mostly uses
spreadsheets or simple relational databases to organise the information as rows
with multiple columns of related attributes. This form offers itself for data
analysis and scholarly interpretation, however it also poses problems including
i) the difficulty for collaborative but controlled documentation by a large
number of users, ii) the lack of representation of the details from which the
documented relations are inferred, iii) the difficulty to extend the underlying
data structures as well as to combine and integrate data from multiple and
diverse information sources, and iv) the limitation to reuse the data beyond
the context of a particular research activity. To support historians to cope
with these problems, in this paper we describe the Synthesis documentation
system and its use by a large number of historians in the context of an ongoing
research project in the field of History of Art. The system is Web-based and
collaborative, and makes use of existing standards for information
documentation and publication (CIDOC-CRM, RDF), focusing on semantic
interoperability and the production of data of high value and long-term

in a multistable homogeneous steady-state regime, two branches of dark
localized structures can coexist for a fixed value of the system parameters.
These coexisting solutions possess different polarization states and different
power peaks in the microresonator. We characterize in-depth their formation by
drawing their bifurcation diagrams in regimes close to modulational instability

a heteroclinic collapse snaking type of behavior. The coexistence of two
vectorial branches of dark localized states is not possible without taking into

Quantum embedding approaches, such as the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT),

approaches are computationally demanding on classical computing architectures,
and hence remain restricted to small systems, which limits the scope of
applicability without exceptional computational resources. Here we outline a
data-driven machine learning process for solving the Anderson Impurity Model
(AIM) - the central component of DMFT calculations. The key advance is the use
of an ensemble error-correction approach to generate fast and accurate
solutions of AIM. An example calculation of the Mott transition using DMFT in
the single band Hubbard model is given as an example of the technique, and is
validated against the most accurate available method. This new approach is
called data-driven dynamical mean-field theory (\textbf{d$^{3}$MFT}).

known that a solid-like nanolayer of liquid of typical thickness 0.5-1 nm

nanoparticle and the bulk liquid. Yet, its effect on the nanofluid viscosity
has not been elucidated so far. In this article, we compute the local viscosity
of the nanolayer using equilibrium molecular dynamics based on the Green-Kubo

locally. We apply this methodology to the calculation of the local viscosity in
the immediate vicinity of a metallic nanoparticle for a wide range of
solid-liquid interaction strength, where a nanolayer of thickness 1 nm is
observed as a result of the interaction with the nanoparticle. The viscosity of
the nanolayer, which is found to be higher than its corresponding bulk value,
is directly dependent on the solid-liquid interaction strength. We discuss the
origin of this viscosity enhancement and show that the liquid density increment
alone cannot explain the values of the viscosity observed. Rather, we suggest
that the solid-like structure of the distribution of the liquid atoms in the
vicinity of the nanoparticle contributes to the nanolayer viscosity
enhancement. Finally, we observe a failure of the Stokes-Einstein relation
between viscosity and diffusion close to the wall, depending on the
liquid-solid interaction strength, which we rationalize in terms of
hydrodynamic slip.

properties of a network, i.e., it is widely adopted to find the densest part of
a network across a broad range of scientific fields, including Internet,
biological networks, social networks, etc. However, there arises concern about
the robustness of the k-shell structure when networks suffer from adversarial
attacks. Here, we introduce and formalize the problem of the k-shell attack and
develop an efficient strategy to attack the k-shell structure by rewiring a
small number of links. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to
study the robustness of graph k-shell structure under adversarial attacks. In
particular, we propose a Simulated Annealing (SA) based k-shell attack method
and testify it on four real-world social networks. The extensive experiments
validate that the k-shell structure of a network is robust under random
perturbation, but it is quite vulnerable under adversarial attack, e.g., in
Dolphin and Throne networks, more than 40% nodes change their k-shell values
when only 10% links are changed based on our SA-based k-shell attack. Such
results suggest that a single structural feature could also be significantly
disturbed when only a small fraction of links are changed purposefully in a
network. Therefore, it could be an interesting topic to improve the robustness
of various network properties against adversarial attack in the future.

years, outperforming the CNN architectures in many computer vision tasks, as
exemplified by the Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification. However,
existing visual transformer models aim to extract semantic information for
high-level tasks, such as classification and detection.These methods ignore the
importance of the spatial resolution of the input image, thus sacrificing the
local correlation information of neighboring pixels. In this paper, we propose
a Patch Pyramid Transformer(PPT) to effectively address the above
issues.Specifically, we first design a Patch Transformer to transform the image
into a sequence of patches, where transformer encoding is performed for each
patch to extract local representations. In addition, we construct a Pyramid
Transformer to effectively extract the non-local information from the entire
image. After obtaining a set of multi-scale, multi-dimensional, and multi-angle
features of the original image, we design the image reconstruction network to
ensure that the features can be reconstructed into the original input. To
validate the effectiveness, we apply the proposed Patch Pyramid Transformer to
image fusion tasks. The experimental results demonstrate its superior
performance, compared to the state-of-the-art fusion approaches, achieving the
best results on several evaluation indicators. Thanks to the underlying
representational capacity of the PPT network, it can directly be applied to
different image fusion tasks without redesigning or retraining the network.

to unprecedented changes in Internet usage and video communications
applications that are sensitive to network latency have exploded in popularity.
However, in today's typical networks-such as a home network-those applications
often degrade if they are sharing a network link with other network traffic.
This is a problem caused by a network design flaw often described using the
term 'buffer bloat'. Several years ago, Comcast helped to fund research and
development in the technical community into new Active Queue Management (AQM)
techniques to eliminate this issue and AQM was later built into Data Over Cable
Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standards.
  Just prior to the pandemic, Comcast also deployed a large-scale network
performance measurement system that included a latency under load test. In
addition, Comcast happened to deploy two otherwise identical cable modems; one
with upstream AQM enabled, and the other without. This fortuitous confluence of
events has enabled Comcast to perform a comparative analysis of the differences
between cable modem gateways using AQM with those that lack that enhancement,
at a unique level of scale across many months of time and millions of devices.
  The data reveals significantly better upstream latency under load performance
when AQM is used. For the device with AQM, most of the latency under load tests
resulted in 15-30 milliseconds of latency. In comparison, the device without
AQM averaged roughly 250 milliseconds of latency, between 8-16 times higher, a
highly significant difference to the end user quality of experience. These
large-scale measurement comparisons should provide additional data to justify
accelerated deployment of AQM in DOCSIS and other Internet Service Provider
networks and user-purchased home network equipment.

Maxwell Chern-Simons gauge theory for defining fractional filling of Landau

partially occupied Landau levels. We derived the k-factor scaling hierarchy in
Chern-Simons gauge theory, as the scaling hierarchy of the magnetic field or
magnetic flux in FQHE. This is crucial in our simple explanation of FQHE as a
topological invariant in phase space. For the fundamental scaling hierarchy,
the integer k must be a prime number, and for fractions both the numerator and
denominator of k must also be prime numbers. The assumption in the literature
that a hierarchy of denominators of v = 1 k is given by the expression, (2n +
1), is wrong. Furthermore, even denominators for v cannot belong to fundamental
scaling hierarchy and is often absent or less resolved in the experiments.

transitions from a cubic crystal to a trigonal (or tertagonal) structure. For
many years, the critical exponents in both these types of transitions have been
fitted to those of the isotropic three-commponents Heisenberg model. Recent
field theoretical accurate calculations showed that this is wrong: the
isotropic fixed point of the renormalization group (RG) is unstable, and RG
iterations flow either to a `cubic' fixed point or to a fluctuation-driven
first-order transition. These distinct flows correspond to two distinct
universality classes, identified by the symmetry of the ordered structures
below the transitions. Here we show that perovskites which become trigonal or
tetragonal belong to these two universality classes, respectively. The close
vicinity of the isotropic and cubic fixed points explains the apparent wrong
observations of a single universality class, but also implies the existence of
slowly varying effective material-dependent exponents. For the tetragonal case,
these effective exponents can have the `isotropic' values before crossing to
the first-order transition. We propose dedicated experiments to test these
predictions. We also expect a similar splitting of the universality classes in
any situation in which two (or more) fixed points compete for stability.

annotation is time-consuming and often requires expertise, which is a huge
bottleneck in building large datasets. On the other hand, self-supervised
learning (SSL) exploits the freely available data to generate supervisory

tasks on huge unlabelled data proves to be very helpful for multiple downstream
tasks.
  Our idea is to leverage self-supervision such that the model learns useful
representations of fine-grained image classes. We experimented with 3 kinds of

topological insulator (TI) that acts as the source of the topological features

non-topological residual models with degenerate spectra and in-gap impurity
states appear, which dilute the topologically protected component of the
starting edge states. Here, we generalize this method to several
two-dimensional models, by finding the 4-root version of lattices hosting weak
and higher-order boundary modes (both topological and non-topological) of a
Chern insulator and of a topological semimetal. We further show that a starting
model with a non-Hermitian region in parameter space and a complex energy
spectrum can nevertheless display a purely real spectrum for all its successive
squared versions, allowing for an exact mapping between certain non-Hermitian

necessary to solve the radiative transfer equation in the presence of
absorption and scattering, coupled with the equation for radiative equilibrium.
However, solving this problem requires much CPU time, which makes the use of
automatic minimisation procedures to characterise these environments
challenging. The use of approximate methods is then of primary interest. One
promising candidate method is the flux-limited diffusion (FLD), which recasts
the radiative transfer problem into a non-linear diffusion equation. One
important aspect for the accuracy of the method lies in the implementation of
appropriate boundary conditions (BCs). We present new BCs for the FLD
approximation in circumstellar environments that we apply here to spherically
symmetric envelopes. At the inner boundary, the entering flux (coming from the
star and from the envelope itself) may be written in the FLD formalism and
provides us with an adequate BC. At the free outer boundary, we used the FLD
formalism to constrain the ratio of the mean radiation intensity over the
emerging flux. In both cases we derived non-linear mixed BCs relating the
surface values of the mean specific intensity and its gradient. We implemented
these conditions and compared the results with previous benchmarks and the
results of a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. A comparison with results
derived from BCs that were previously proposed in other contexts is presented
as well. For all the tested cases, the average relative difference with the
benchmark results is below 2\% for the temperature profile and below 6\% for
the corresponding spectral energy distribution or the emerging flux. We point
out that the FLD method together with the new outer BC also allows us to derive
an approximation for the emerging flux.

predicting 3D positional relationships between the root joint and other human

are not robust to global motion, and lack the ability to accurately predict
local motion with a small movement range. To alleviate these two problems, we
propose a relative information encoding method that yields positional and
temporal enhanced representations. Firstly, we encode positional information by
utilizing relative coordinates of 2D poses to enhance the consistency between
the input and output distribution. The same posture with different absolute 2D
positions can be mapped to a common representation. It is beneficial to resist
the interference of global motion on the prediction results. Second, we encode
temporal information by establishing the connection between the current pose
and other poses of the same person within a period of time. More attention will
be paid to the movement changes before and after the current pose, resulting in
better prediction performance on local motion with a small movement range. The
ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed relative
information encoding method. Besides, we introduce a multi-stage optimization
method to the whole framework to further exploit the positional and temporal
enhanced representations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on

irrelevant to a material's low-energy properties. But the discovery of enhanced
superconductivity in heavily electron-doped FeSe-derived superconductors poses
questions about the possible role of incipient bands (those laying close to but
not crossing the Fermi level) in pairing. To answer this question, researchers
have studied pairing correlations in the bilayer Hubbard model, which has an
incipient band for large interlayer hopping $t_\perp$, using many-body
perturbation theory and variational methods. They have generally found that
superconductivity is enhanced as one of the bands approaches the Liftshiz
transition and even when it becomes incipient. Here, we address this question
using the nonperturbative quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) dynamical cluster
approximation (DCA) to study the bilayer Hubbard model's pairing correlations.
We find that the model has robust $s_\pm$ pairing correlations in the large
$t_\perp$ limit, which can become stronger as one band is made incipient. While
this behavior is linked to changes in the effective interaction, we further
find that it is counteracted by a suppression of the intrinsic pair-field
susceptibility and does not translate to an increased $T_c$. Our results
demonstrate that the highest achievable transition temperatures in the bilayer
Hubbard model occur when the system has two bands crossing the Fermi level.

indicate that the sound speed in the SQS matter is approximately a constant
close to the conformal limit of $c/\sqrt{3}$. The universal relations between
the mass, the tidal deformability and the compactness are provided for the

fundamental improvements to supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement
learning. In reinforcement learning, a so-called agent is challenged to solve a
task given by some environment. The agent learns to solve the task by exploring
the environment and exploiting the rewards it gets from the environment. For
some classical task environments, such as deterministic strictly epochal
environments, an analogue quantum environment can be constructed which allows
to find rewards quadratically faster by applying quantum algorithms. In this
paper, we analytically analyze the behavior of a hybrid agent which combines
this quadratic speedup in exploration with the policy update of a classical
agent. This leads to a faster learning of the hybrid agent compared to the
classical agent. We demonstrate that if the classical agent needs on average
$\langle J \rangle$ rewards and $\langle T \rangle_c$ epochs to learn how to
solve the task, the hybrid agent will take $\langle T \rangle_q \leq \alpha
\sqrt{\langle T \rangle_c \langle J \rangle}$ epochs on average. Here, $\alpha$
denotes a constant which is independent of the problem size. Additionally, we
prove that if the environment allows for maximally $\alpha_o k_\text{max}$

this problem in the framework of a minimal phase-coupling model, which enables
a detailed investigation by means of dynamical systems theory and multi-scale
high-resolution simulations. We identify the spectral power-law steepness,
which controls the phase coupling, as the control parameter for tuning the
non-Gaussian properties of the system. Whereas both very steep and very shallow
spectra exhibit close-to-Gaussian statistics, the strongest departures are
observed for intermediate slopes comparable to the ones in hydrodynamic and
Burgers turbulence. We show that the non-Gaussian regime of the model coincides
with a collapse of the dynamical system to a lower-dimensional attractor and
the emergence of phase synchronization, thereby establishing a
dynamical-systems perspective on turbulent intermittency.

planet around the nearby bright ($V=8.75$ mag, $K=7.15$ mag) solar twin HD
183579, delivered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The host
star is located $56.8\pm0.1$ pc away with a radius of $R_{\ast}=0.97\pm0.02\
R_{\odot}$ and a mass of $M_{\ast}=1.03\pm0.05\ M_{\odot}$. We confirm the
planetary nature by combining space and ground-based photometry, spectroscopy,
and imaging. We find that HD 183579b (TOI-1055b) has a radius of
$R_{p}=3.53\pm0.13\ R_{\oplus}$ on a $17.47$ day orbit with a mass of
$M_{p}=11.2\pm5.4\ M_{\oplus}$ ($3\sigma$ mass upper limit of $27.4\
M_{\oplus}$). HD 183579b is the fifth brightest known sub-Neptune planet system
in the sky, making it an excellent target for future studies of the interior
structure and atmospheric properties. By performing a line-by-line differential
analysis using the high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio HARPS spectra, we
find that HD 183579 joins the typical solar twin sample, without a
statistically significant refractory element depletion.

The axion decay constant originates from the IR scale, which in the

and Hexagonal Close-Packing structure (HCP), globally and at fixed density. In
the Riesz case, new evidence of the global minimality at fixed density of the
BCC lattice is shown for $s<0$ and the HCP lattice is computed to have higher
energy than the FCC (for $s>3/2$) and BCC (for $s<3/2$) lattices. In the
Lennard-Jones case with exponents $3<m<n$, the ground state among lattices is
confirmed to be a FCC lattice whereas a HCP phase occurs once added to the
investigated structures. Furthermore, phase transitions of type ``FCC-SH"" and
``FCC-HCP-SH"" (when the HCP lattice is added) as the inverse density $V$
increases are observed for a large spectrum of exponents $(n,m)$. In the SH
phase, the variation of the ratio $\Delta$ between the inter-layer distance $d$
and the lattice parameter $a$ is studied as $V$ increases. In the critical
region of exponents $0<m<n<3$, the SH phase with an extreme value of the
anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ dominates. If one limits oneself to rigid

In the erase-repetition game, whenever a square occurs the second part of the

  Grytczuk, Kozik, and Micek showed that Ann has a winning strategy for the

chronic illness symptoms (e.g., asthma, congestive heart failure), acute
illness (e.g., breathlessness due to infection), and over the course of the day
due to physical exhaustion during heightened exertion. Remote estimation of RR
can offer a cost-effective method to track disease progression and
cardio-respiratory fitness over time. This work investigates a model-driven
approach to estimate RR from short audio segments obtained after physical

microphone-enabled, near-field headphones before, during, and after strenuous

convolutional layers was implemented to process mel-filterbank energies,
estimate RR in varying background noise conditions, and predict heavy
breathing, indicated by an RR of more than 25 breaths per minute. The
multi-task model performs both classification and regression tasks and
leverages a mixture of loss functions. It was observed that RR can be estimated

This article introduces the idea that online trading platform technical issues

More importantly it shows these technical issues are the contributing factors

technical issues of one of the world's leading online trading providers and
calculate retail traders losses caused by these issues. To do this, we
independently record each trade details using the REST API response provided by
the broker. We show traders log activity files is the only way to assess any
suspected profit or loss manipulation by the broker. Therefore, it is essential
for any retail trader to have access to their log files. We compare our
findings with broker's Trustpilot customer reviews. We illustrate how traders'
profit and loss can be negatively affected by broker's platform technical
issues such as not being able to close profitable trades, closing trades with
delays, disappearance of trades, disappearance of profit from clients
statements, profit and loss discrepancies, stop loss not being triggered, stop
loss or limit order triggered too early. Although regulatory bodies try to
ensure that consumers get a fair deal, these attempts are hugely insufficient
in protecting retail traders. Therefore, regulatory bodies such as the FCA
should take these technical issues seriously and not rely on brokers' internal
investigations, because under any other circumstances, these platform
manipulations would be considered as crimes and connivingly misappropriating

information via multi-tracer cross-correlations that suppress cosmic variance
on ultra-large scales. In order to fully incorporate wide-angle effects and
redshift-bin cross-correlations, together with lensing magnification and other
relativistic effects, we use the angular power spectra, $C_\ell(z_i,z_j)$.
Applying a Fisher analysis, we forecast the expected precision on $f_{\rm NL}$

the full combination of two pairs of 21cm and galaxy surveys, one pair at low

detect the Doppler effect with a signal-to-noise ratio $\sim$8 and measure the

with 4 thousand models and their respective CN properties. They are employed in
a supervised classification setup considering four vision benchmarks. Each
neural network is approached as a weighted and undirected graph of neurons and
synapses, and centrality measures are computed after training. Results show
that these measures are highly related to the network classification
performance. We also propose the concept of Bag-Of-Neurons (BoN), a CN-based
approach for finding topological signatures linking similar neurons. Results
suggest that six neuronal types emerge in such networks, independently of the
target domain, and are distributed differently according to classification
accuracy. We also tackle specific CN properties related to performance, such as
higher subgraph centrality on lower-performing models. Our findings suggest
that CN properties play a critical role in the performance of fully connected

Widely applied traditional signal analysis methods such as fitting cosine

periods do not change over time. However, novel high-resolution recording

time-dependent changes of periods and amplitudes which cannot be captured with

examples how to detect rhythms, compute and interpret high-resolution
time-dependent spectral results, analyze the main oscillatory component and to

$0.166\pm0.068$, and remains nearly constant until 1850 A. As this spectral
shape is characteristic of H$_2$O ice absorption, Charon is the first Kuiper
belt object with a H$_2$O ice surface to be detected in the far-ultraviolet.
Charon's geometric albedo is $\sim3.7$ times lower than Enceladus' at these
wavelengths, but has a very similar spectral shape. We attribute this to
similarities in their surface compositions, and the difference in absolute
reflectivity to a high concentration or more-absorbing contaminants on Charon's
surface. Finally, we find that Charon has different solar phase behavior in the
FUV than Enceladus, Mimas, Tethys, and Dione, with a stronger opposition surge
than Enceladus and a shallower decline at intermediate solar phase angles than

indirectly capture the progressive failure process of the brittle rock. In
previous studies, both the experiment and numerical simulation were adopted to
investigate AE characteristics of the brittle rock. However, as the most
popular numerical model, the moment tensor model (MTM) did not reproduce the
monitoring and analyzing manner of AE signals from the physical experiment.
Consequently, its result could not be constrained by the experimental result.
It is thus necessary to evaluate the consistency and compatibility between the
experiment and MTM. To fulfill this, we developed a particle-velocity-based
model (PVBM) which enabled directly monitor and analyze the particle velocity
in the numerical model and had good robustness. The PVBM imitated the actual
experiment and could fill in gaps between the experiment and MTM. AE
experiments of Marine shale under uniaxial compression were carried out, of
which results were simulated by MTM. In general, the variation trend of the
experimental result could be presented by MTM. Nevertheless, magnitudes of AE
parameters by MTM presented notable differences with more than several orders
compared with those by the experiment. We sequentially used PVBM as a proxy to
analyze these discrepancies quantitatively and make a systematical evaluation
on AE characterization of brittle rocks from the experiment to numerical
simulation, considering the influence of wave reflection, energy geometrical
diffusion, viscous attenuation, particle size as well as progressive
deterioration of rock material. It was suggested that only the combination of
MTM and PVBM could reasonably and accurately acquire AE characteristics of the
actual AE experiment of brittle rocks by making full use of their respective
advantages.

confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation, to support
trillions of transactions annually in the digital economy. Efficient digital
signatures, ensuring the integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data
with information-theoretical security are highly urgent and intractable open
problems in cryptography. Here, we propose a protocol of high-efficiency
quantum digital signatures using secret sharing, one-time universal$_2$
hashing, and the one-time pad. We just need to use a 384-bit key to sign
documents of up to $2^{64}$ lengths with a security bound of $10^{-19}$. If
one-megabit document is signed, the signature efficiency is improved by more
than $10^8$ times compared with previous quantum digital signature protocols.
Furthermore, we build the first all-in-one quantum secure network integrating
information-theoretically secure communication, digital signatures, secret
sharing, and conference key agreement and experimentally demonstrate this
signature efficiency advantage. Our work completes the cryptography toolbox of
the four information security objectives.

Schr\""odinger operator $L_{{\bf a},V}=-(\nabla-i{\bf a})^2+V$ with a singular
or irregular magnetic field ${\bf B}$ on $\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq3$. We do this by
constructing a new landscape function for $L_{{\bf a},V}$, and proving its
corresponding uncertainty principle, under certain directionality assumptions
on ${\bf B}$, but with no assumption on $\nabla{\bf B}$. These results arise as
applications of our study of the Filoche-Mayboroda landscape function $u$, a
solution to the equation $L_Vu=-\operatorname{div} A\nabla u+Vu=1$, on
unbounded Lipschitz domains in $\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq1$, and $0\leq V\in

eigenfunctions, and Lax-Milgram solutions in an Agmon distance with weight
$1/u$, which may degenerate. Similar a priori results hold for $L_{{\bf a},V}$.
Furthermore, when $n\geq3$ and $V$ satisfies a scale-invariant Kato condition
and a weak doubling property, we show that $1/\sqrt u$ is pointwise equivalent
to the Fefferman-Phong-Shen maximal function $m(\cdot,V)$; in particular this
gives a strong scale-invariant Harnack inequality for $u$, and a setting where
the Agmon distance with weight $1/u$ is not too degenerate. Finally, we extend
results from the literature for $L_{{\bf a},V}$ regarding exponential decay of
the fundamental solution and eigenfunctions, to the situation of irregular

superconducting terminals hosts a quasi-continuous spectrum of Andreev states.
The spectrum is sensitive to the superconducting phases of the terminals. It
can be either gapped or gapless depending on the point in the multi-dimensional
parametric space of these phases. Special points in this space correspond to
setting some terminals to the phase 0 and the rest to the phase of $\pi$. For a
generic nanostructure, three distinct spectra come together in the vicinity of
a special point: two gapped phases of different topology and a gapless phase
separating the two by virtue of topological protection.
  In this paper, we show that a weak interaction manifesting as quantum
fluctuations of superconducting phases drastically changes the spectrum in a
narrow vicinity of a special point. We develop an interaction model and derive
a universal generic quantum action that describes this situation. The action is
complicated by incorporating a non-local in time matrix order parameter, and
its full analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper. Here, we identify
and address two limits: the semiclassical one and the quantum one,
concentrating on the first-order interaction correction in the last case.
  In both cases, we find that the interaction squeezes the domain of the
gapless phase in the narrow vicinity of the point so the gapped phases tend to
contact each other immediately, defying the topological protection. We identify
the domains of strong coupling where the perturbation theory does not work. In
the gapless phase, we find the logarithmic divergence of the first-order
corrections. This leads us to an interesting hypothesis: weak interaction might
induce an exponentially small gap in the formerly gapless phase.

experiment may harbinger a new era in $\mu$ and $\tau$ physics. In the context
of general two Higgs doublet model, the discrepancy can be explained via
one-loop exchange of sub-TeV exotic scalar and pseudoscalars, namely $H$ and
$A$, that have flavor changing neutral couplings $\rho_{\tau\mu}$ and
$\rho_{\mu\tau}$ at $\sim 20$ times the usual tau Yukawa coupling,
$\lambda_\tau$. Taking $\rho_{\ell\ell^\prime}\sim \lambda_{ \rm min(\ell,
\ell^\prime)}$, we show that the above solution to muon $g-2$ then predicts
enhanced rates of various charged lepton flavor violating processes, which
should be accessible at upcoming experiments. We cover muon related processes
such as $\mu \to e \gamma$, $\mu \to eee$ and $\mu N \to e N$, and $\tau$
decays $\tau \to \mu \gamma$ and $\tau \to \mu\mu\mu$. A similar one-loop
diagram with $\rho_{e\tau}= \rho_{\tau e} = {\cal O}(\lambda_e)$ induces $\mu
\to e\gamma$, bringing the rate right into the sensitivity of the MEG~II
experiment. The $\mu e\gamma$ dipole can be probed further by $\mu \to 3e$ and
$\mu N \to e N$. With its promised sensitivity range and ability to use
different nuclei, the $\mu N \to eN$ conversion experiments can not only make
discovery, but access the extra diagonal quark Yukawa couplings $\rho_{qq}$.
For the $\tau$ lepton, we find that $\tau \to \mu\gamma$ would probe
$\rho_{\tau\tau}$ down to $\lambda_\tau$ or lower, while $\tau \to 3\mu$ would
probe $\rho_{\mu\mu}$ to ${\cal O}(\lambda_{\mu})$.

distance or travel time and ignore road safety altogether. However, many
travellers prefer to avoid risky or unpleasant road conditions such as roads
with high crime rates (e.g., robberies, kidnapping, riots etc.) and bumpy
roads. To facilitate safe travel, we introduce a novel query for road networks
called the k safest nearby neighbors (kSNN) query. Given a query location
$v_l$, a distance constraint $d_c$ and a point of interest $p_i$, we define the
safest path from $v_l$ to $p_i$ as the path with the highest path safety score
among all the paths from $v_l$ to $p_i$ with length less than $d_c$. The path
safety score is computed considering the road safety of each road segment on
the path. Given a query location $v_l$, a distance constraint $d_c$ and a set
of POIs P, a kSNN query returns k POIs with the k highest path safety scores in
P along with their respective safest paths from the query location. We develop
two novel indexing structures called Ct-tree and a safety score based Voronoi

exploiting one of the proposed indexes to effectively refine the search space

are rarer still around those that are metal-poor. However, owing to the large
planet-to-star radius ratio, these planets are highly suitable for atmospheric
study via transmission spectroscopy in the infrared, such as with JWST. Here we
report the discovery and validation of a sub-Neptune orbiting the thick-disk,
mid-M dwarf star TOI-2406. We first infer properties of the host star by
analysing the star's near-infrared spectrum, spectral energy distribution, and
Gaia parallax. We use multi-band photometry to confirm that the transit event
is on-target and achromatic, and we statistically validate the TESS signal as a
transiting exoplanet. We then determine physical properties of the planet
through global transit modelling of the TESS and ground-based time-series data.
We determine the host to be a metal-poor M4V star, located at a distance of 56
pc, with a sub-solar metallicity $(\mathrm{[Fe/H] = -0.38 \pm 0.07})$, and a
member of the thick disk. The planet is a relatively large sub-Neptune for the
M-dwarf planet population, with $\mathrm{R_p = 2.94 \pm 0.17}
\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ and $\mathrm{P = 3.077}$ d, producing transits of 2% depth.
We note the orbit has a non-zero eccentricity to 3$\mathrm{\sigma}$, prompting
questions about the dynamical history of the system. This system is an
interesting outcome of planet formation and presents a benchmark for
large-planet formation around metal-poor, low-mass stars. The system warrants
further study, in particular radial velocity follow-up to determine the planet
mass and constrain possible bound companions. Furthermore, TOI-2406 b is a good
target for future atmospheric study through transmission spectroscopy,

wind energy can contribute to the energy transition in many parts of the world.
Being highly variable and complex to model, the quantification of the
spatio-temporal variation of wind power and the related uncertainty is highly
relevant for energy planners. Machine Learning has become a popular tool to
perform wind-speed and power predictions. However, the existing approaches have
several limitations. These include (i) insufficient consideration of
spatio-temporal correlations in wind-speed data, (ii) a lack of existing
methodologies to quantify the uncertainty of wind speed prediction and its
propagation to the wind-power estimation, and (iii) a focus on less than hourly
frequencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a framework to
reconstruct a spatio-temporal field on a regular grid from irregularly
distributed wind-speed measurements. After decomposing data into temporally
referenced basis functions and their corresponding spatially distributed
coefficients, the latter are spatially modelled using Extreme Learning
Machines. Estimates of both model and prediction uncertainties, and of their
propagation after the transformation of wind speed into wind power, are then
provided without any assumptions on distribution patterns of the data. The
methodology is applied to the study of hourly wind power potential on a grid of
250 by 250 squared meters for turbines of 100 meters hub height in Switzerland,
generating the first dataset of its type for the country. The potential wind
power generation is combined with the available area for wind turbine
installations to yield an estimate of the technical potential for wind power in
Switzerland. The wind power estimate presented here represents an important
input for planners to support the design of future energy systems with
increased wind power generation.

number of admitted patients. An accurate prediction of the most likely
individual disease progression can improve the planning of limited resources
and finding the optimal treatment for patients. However, when dealing with a
newly emerging disease such as COVID-19, the impact of patient- and
disease-specific factors (e.g. body weight or known co-morbidities) on the
immediate course of disease is by and large unknown. In the case of COVID-19,
the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission of pneumonia patients is often
determined only by acute indicators such as vital signs (e.g. breathing rate,
blood oxygen levels), whereas statistical analysis and decision support systems
that integrate all of the available data could enable an earlier prognosis. To
this end, we propose a holistic graph-based approach combining both imaging and
non-imaging information. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal similarity
metric to build a population graph for clustering patients and an image-based
end-to-end Graph Attention Network to process this graph and predict the
COVID-19 patient outcomes: admission to ICU, need for ventilation and
mortality. Additionally, the network segments chest CT images as an auxiliary
task and extracts image features and radiomics for feature fusion with the
available metadata. Results on a dataset collected in Klinikum rechts der Isar
in Munich, Germany show that our approach outperforms single modality and
non-graph baselines. Moreover, our clustering and graph attention allow for
increased understanding of the patient relationships within the population
graph and provide insight into the network's decision-making process.

wave in a nonlinearly elastic bar to the energy in the oscillations in two
related dissipationless, dispersive systems. In contrast to a phase boundary,
there is no kinetic relation associated with a shock wave. Three
one-dimensional dynamic impact problems are studied: Problem 1 concerns a
nonlinearly elastic bar, Problem 2 a discrete chain of particles, and Problem 3
a continuum with a strain gradient term in the constitutive relation. In the
impact problem considered, the free boundary of each initially quiescent body
is subjected to a sudden velocity that is then held constant for all subsequent
time. There is energy dissipation at the shock in Problem 1 but Problems 2 and
3 are conservative. Problem 1 is solved analytically, Problem 2 numerically and
an approximate solution to Problem 3 is constructed using modulation theory.
The rate of increase of the oscillatory energy in Problems 2 and 3 are
calculated and compared with the dissipation rate at the shock in Problem 1.
The results indicate that the former is a good measure of the latter.

adapt the recently proposed nonparametric posterior learning technique to the

derive sampling algorithms which are trivially parallelizable, scalable and
very easy to implement. In addition, we prove conditional consistency and
tightness for the distribution of produced samples in the small noise limit

naturally in the context of identifiability problem for misspecified

Chain Monte Carlo sampling based on one data augmentation scheme which is very
popular in the context of Expectation-Maximization algorithms for PET or SPECT.
We show theoretically and also numerically that such data augmentation
significantly increases mixing times for the Markov chain. In view of this, our

illustrates how the violation occurs. In general, there exist many diverse

obtaining this information is challenging in existing model checkers since (1)

generate discriminative fused features for ReID. Since tensor-based methods
usually contain a large number of parameters, training all of these parameters
becomes very slow, and the chance of overfitting increases as well. To address
this issue, we propose two new techniques based on Structural Sparsity Learning

labels for the other attributes (e.g., big nose) are limited which causes their
prediction challenging. To address this problem, we use a new Multi-Task
Learning (MTL) paradigm in which a facial attribute predictor uses the
knowledge of other related attributes to obtain a better generalization
performance. Here, we leverage MLT paradigm in two problem settings. First, it
is assumed that the structure of the tasks (e.g., grouping pattern of facial
attributes) is known as a prior knowledge, and parameters of the tasks (i.e.,
predictors) within the same group are represented by a linear combination of a
limited number of underlying basis tasks. Here, a sparsity constraint on the
coefficients of this linear combination is also considered such that each task
is represented in a more structured and simpler manner. Second, it is assumed
that the structure of the tasks is unknown, and then structure and parameters
of the tasks are learned jointly by using a Laplacian regularization framework.

arose from the unification of 3-dimensional space with 1-dimensional time into
a 4-dimensional spacetime. Many other physical concepts also arise in similar
3+1 relationships, and attempts have been made to unify some of these also.
Examples in particle physics include the three intermediate vector bosons of
the weak interaction, and the single photon of electromagnetism. The accepted
unification in this case is the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model of electro-weak
interactions, which forms part of the standard model. Another example is the
three colours of quarks and one of leptons. In this case, the Pati-Salam model
attempts the unification, but is not currently part of the accepted standard
model.
  I investigate these and other instances of 3+1=4 in fundamental physics, to
see if a comparison between the successful and unsuccessful unifications can

that applying the group-theoretical methods of the more successful unifications
