of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). Under some mild Lov\'asz local lemma
conditions where each constraint of the CSP has a small number of forbidden
local configurations, our algorithm is accurate and efficient: it outputs a
perfect uniform random solution and its expected running time is quasilinear in
the number of variables. Prior to our work, perfect samplers are only shown to
exist for CSPs under much more restrictive conditions (Guo, Jerrum, and Liu,
JACM'19).
  Our algorithm has two components:
  1. A simple perfect sampling algorithm using bounding chains (Huber, STOC'98;
Haggstrom and Nelander, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics'99). This sampler is
efficient if each variable domain is small.
  2. A simple but powerful state tensorization trick to reduce large domains to
smaller ones. This trick is a generalization of state compression (Feng, He,
and Yin, STOC'21).
  The crux of our analysis is a simple information percolation argument which
allows us to achieve bounds even beyond current best approximate samplers
(Jain, Pham, and Vuong, ArXiv'21).
  Previous related works either use intricate algorithms or need sophisticated
analysis or even both. Thus we view the simplicity of both our algorithm and
analysis as a strength of our work.

  Classification","13 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Network traffic classification, a task to classify network traffic and
identify its type, is the most fundamental step to improve network services and
manage modern networks. Classical machine learning and deep learning method
have developed well in the field of network traffic classification. However,
there are still two major challenges. One is how to protect the privacy of
users' traffic data, and the other is that it is difficult to obtain labeled
data in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using federated
semi-supervised learning for network traffic classification. In our approach,
the federated servers and several clients work together to train a global
classification model. Among them, unlabeled data is used on the client, and
labeled data is used on the server. Moreover, we use two traffic subflow
sampling methods: simple sampling and incremental sampling for data
preprocessing. The experimental results in the QUIC dataset show that the
accuracy of our federated semi-supervised approach can reach 91.08% and 97.81%
when using the simple sampling method and incremental sampling method
respectively. The experimental results also show that the accuracy gap between
our method and the centralized training method is minimal, and it can
effectively protect users' privacy and does not require a large amount of
labeled data.

PROSPECT-II will sharpen a tool with potential value for basic neutrino

a two-year deployment at HFIR, an additional PROSPECT-II deployment at a low

items) to enhance the performance of recommendation systems has been widely
recognized as an important modelling dimension. While many existing approaches
focus on the integration scheme to incorporate entity side information -- by
combining the recommendation loss function with an extra side information-aware
loss -- in this paper, we propose instead a novel pre-training scheme for
leveraging the side information. In particular, we first pre-train a
representation model using the side information of the entities, and then
fine-tune it using an existing general representation-based recommendation
model. Specifically, we propose two pre-training models, named GCN-P and COM-P,
by considering the entities and their relations constructed from side
information as two different types of graphs respectively, to pre-train entity
embeddings. For the GCN-P model, two single-relational graphs are constructed
from all the users' and items' side information respectively, to pre-train
entity representations by using the Graph Convolutional Networks. For the COM-P
model, two multi-relational graphs are constructed to pre-train the entity
representations by using the Composition-based Graph Convolutional Networks. An
extensive evaluation of our pre-training models fine-tuned under four general
representation-based recommender models, i.e. MF, NCF, NGCF and LightGCN, shows
that effectively pre-training embeddings with both the user's and item's side
information can significantly improve these original models in terms of both
effectiveness and stability.

the discovery of process models. However, the timestamps of events may be

does not imply that the former causes the latter. This paper explores the
relationship between time and order. Moreover, it describes an approach to
preprocess event data having timestamp-related problems. This approach avoids
using accidental or unreliable orders and timestamps, creates partial orders to
capture uncertainty, and allows for exploiting domain knowledge to (re)order

existing process mining techniques that cannot handle partially ordered event

identification of an appropriate set of collective variables. These are meant
to describe the system's modes that most slowly approach equilibrium. Once
identified, the equilibration of these modes is accelerated by the enhanced

powerful and robust algorithm that, given an initial enhanced sampling
simulation performed with trial collective variables or generalized ensembles,
extracts transfer operator eigenfunctions using a neural network ansatz and

many-body systems is severely limited by the absence of sufficiently scalable
and flexible certification tools. This issue is particularly critical in
situations where the structure of entanglement is a priori unknown, and where
one cannot rely on existing entanglement witnesses. Here, we implement a scheme
in which the knowledge of the mean value of arbitrary observables can be used
to probe multipartite entanglement in a scalable, certified and systematic
manner. Specifically, we rely on positive semidefinite conditions, independent
of partial-transposition-based criteria, necessarily obeyed if the data can be
reproduced by a separable state. The violation of any of these conditions
yields a specific entanglement witness, tailored to the data of interest,
revealing the salient features of the data which are impossible to reproduce
without entanglement. We validate this approach by probing theoretical
many-body states of several hundreds of qubits relevant to existing
experiments: a single-particle quench in a one-dimensional $XX$ chain; a
many-body quench in a two-dimensional $XX$ model with $1/r^3$ interactions; and
thermal equilibrium states of Heisenberg and transverse-field Ising chains. In
all cases, these investigations have lead us to discover new entanglement
witnesses, some of which could be characterized analytically, generalizing
existing results in the literature. In summary, our paper introduces a flexible
data-driven entanglement detection technique for uncharacterized quantum
many-body states, of immediate relevance to experiments in a quantum advantage

efficiency through experience and could thus evolve as an important concept to
overcome data sparsity. However, the core capability of meta learning-based
approaches is the identification of similar previous tasks given a new task - a
challenge largely unexplored in the biomedical imaging domain. In this paper,
we address the problem of quantifying task similarity with a concept that we
refer to as task fingerprinting. The concept involves converting a given task,
represented by imaging data and corresponding labels, to a fixed-length vector
representation. In fingerprint space, different tasks can be directly compared
irrespective of their data set sizes, types of labels or specific resolutions.
An initial feasibility study in the field of surgical data science (SDS) with
26 classification tasks from various medical and non-medical domains suggests
that task fingerprinting could be leveraged for both (1) selecting appropriate
data sets for pretraining and (2) selecting appropriate architectures for a new

launched via the manipulations of high-wattage appliances and assets are
particularly alarming, as they are not continuously monitored by electric power
utilities. Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) are among such
high-wattage assets. Even EVCSs monitored by the electric power utilities and
protected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms are vulnerable to
cyberattacks. Such cyberattacks cause financial losses to the EVCSs. In this
paper, we propose cyber insurance for EVCSs to hedge the economic loss due to
such cyberattacks and develop a data-driven cyber insurance design model for
public EVCSs. Under mild modeling assumptions, we derive an optimal cyber
insurance premium. Then, we ensure the robustness of this optimal premium and
investigate the risk of insuring the EVCSs using a suitable risk assessment
metric (Conditional Value-at-Risk). A case study with data from EVCSs in
Manhattan, New York illustrates our results. Our results demonstrate that risk
assessment is crucial for designing insurance premiums. Furthermore, the
premium increases in proportion to the loss coverage offered for the EVCSs.
This work informs the stakeholders involved in the roll-out and operation of
public EVCSs about the benefits of cyber insurance and suggests that insurance
premiums can be reduced by deploying state-of-the-art defense mechanisms.

super-algebraic convergence when the extension is infinitely differentiable.
Furthermore, when the density has jump discontinuities, we utilize a certain

verified that rewarding the agent on subgoals improves convergence speed and
practical performance. We attempt to provide a theoretical framework to
quantify the computational benefits of rewarding the completion of subgoals, in
terms of the number of synchronous value iterations. In particular, we consider
subgoals as one-way {\em intermediate states}, which can only be visited once
per episode and propose two settings that consider these one-way intermediate
states: the one-way single-path (OWSP) and the one-way multi-path (OWMP)
settings. In both OWSP and OWMP settings, we demonstrate that adding {\em
intermediate rewards} to subgoals is more computationally efficient than only
rewarding the agent once it completes the goal of reaching a terminal state. We
also reveal a trade-off between computational complexity and the pursuit of the
shortest path in the OWMP setting: adding intermediate rewards significantly
reduces the computational complexity of reaching the goal but the agent may not
find the shortest path, whereas with sparse terminal rewards, the agent finds
the shortest path at a significantly higher computational cost. We also
corroborate our theoretical results with extensive experiments on the MiniGrid
environments using Q-learning and some popular deep RL algorithms.

convergence of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which is frequently degraded
by the improper discretisation of required source terms. The work focuses on
advection-diffusion models in which the source terms are dependent on the
intensity of transported fields. The main findings are applicable to a wide
range of formulations within the LBM framework. All considered source terms are
interpreted as contributions to the zeroth-moment of the distribution function.
These account for sources in a scalar field, such as density, concentration or
temperature. In addition to this, certain immersed boundary methods can be
interpreted as a source term in their formulation, highlighting a further
application for this work.
  This paper is dedicated to three aspects regarding proper inclusion of the
source term in LBM schemes. Firstly, it identifies the differences observed
between the ways source terms are included in the LBM schemes present in the
literature. The algebraic manipulations are explicitly presented in this paper
to clarify the differences observed, and identify their origin. Secondly, it
analyses in full detail, the implicit relation between the value of the
transported macroscopic field, and the sum of the LBM densities. Moreover,
three equivalent forms of the collision operator are presented. Finally,
closed-form solutions of this implicit relation are shown for a variety of
common models.
  The second-order convergence of the proposed LBM schemes is verified on both
linear and non-linear source terms. The pitfalls of the commonly used acoustic
and diffusive scaling are identified and discussed. Moreover, for a simplified
case, the competing errors are shown visually with isolines of error in the
space of spatial and temporal resolutions.

on the accuracy of insights from the AUs, but such adverse impact can
potentially be mitigated by dynamically adjusting NAUTO camera parameters in

into a wide variety of colloidal compounds with lattices akin to ionic
crystals. Recently, a transition from a compound phase with a sublattice of
small particles to a metal-like phase in which the small particles are
delocalized has been predicted computationally and observed experimentally. In
this colloidal metallic phase, the small particles roam the crystal maintaining
the integrity of the lattice of large particles, as electrons do in metals. A
similar transition also occurs in superionic crystals, termed sublattice
melting. Here, we use energetic principles and a generalized molecular dynamics
model of a binary system of functionalized nanoparticles to analyze the
transition to sublattice delocalization in different co-assembled crystal
phases as a function of T, number of grafted chains on the small particles, and
number ratio between the small and large particles $n_s$:$n_l$. We find that
$n_s$:$n_l$ is the primary determinant of crystal type due to energetic
interactions and interstitial site filling, while the number of grafted chains
per small particle determines the stability of these crystals. We observe
first-order sublattice delocalization transitions as T increases, in which the
host lattice transforms from low- to high-symmetry crystal structures,
including A20 to BCT to BCC, Ad to BCT to BCC, and BCC to BCC/FCC to FCC
transitions and lattices. Analogous sublattice transitions driven primarily by
lattice vibrations have been seen in some atomic materials exhibiting an
insulator-metal transition also referred to as metallization. We also find
minima in the lattice vibrations and diffusion coefficient of small particles

object with respect to a fixed frame of reference. Gyroscope, accelerometer,
and magnetometer are some of the fundamental sensors used in attitude
estimation. The orientation angles computed from these sensors are combined
using the sensor fusion methodologies to obtain accurate estimates. The
complementary filter is one of the widely adopted techniques whose performance
is highly dependent on the appropriate selection of its gain parameters. This
paper presents a novel cascaded architecture of the complementary filter that
employs a nonlinear and linear version of the complementary filter within one
framework. The nonlinear version is used to correct the gyroscope bias, while
the linear version estimates the attitude angle. The significant advantage of
the proposed architecture is its independence of the filter parameters, thereby
avoiding tuning the filters gain parameters. The proposed architecture does not
require any mathematical modeling of the system and is computationally
inexpensive. The proposed methodology is applied to the real-world datasets,
and the estimation results were found to be promising compared to the other
state-of-the-art algorithms.

new tasks at meta-test time. Although this capability would make meta-RL a
practical tool for real-world use, offline meta-RL presents additional
challenges beyond online meta-RL or standard offline RL settings. Meta-RL
learns an exploration strategy that collects data for adapting, and also
meta-trains a policy that quickly adapts to data from a new task. Since this
policy was meta-trained on a fixed, offline dataset, it might behave
unpredictably when adapting to data collected by the learned exploration
strategy, which differs systematically from the offline data and thus induces
distributional shift. We propose a hybrid offline meta-RL algorithm, which uses
offline data with rewards to meta-train an adaptive policy, and then collects
additional unsupervised online data, without any reward labels to bridge this
distribution shift. By not requiring reward labels for online collection, this
data can be much cheaper to collect. We compare our method to prior work on
offline meta-RL on simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks and find
that using additional unsupervised online data collection leads to a dramatic

the performance of fully online meta-RL on a range of challenging domains that

different rates of significant coefficients (compressibility analysis). In
particular, the notion of strong $\ell_p$-characterization is introduced to
denote a random sequence that has a well-defined asymptotic limit (sample-wise)
of its best $k$-term approximation error when a fixed rate of significant

shows that the rich family of asymptotically mean stationary (AMS) processes

characterize and analyze the $\ell_p$-approximation error function for this

introduce a theorem demonstrating that the approximation error function is

discrete-time sparse processes and, on the technical side, confirm how

recently been validated (with some caveats) in non-rotating shear flows. It is
not clear, however, whether his model remains valid in the presence of
rotation, even though this was its original purpose. Furthermore, new
instabilities arise in rotating fluids, such as the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke
(GSF) instability. Which instability dominates when more than one can be
excited, and how they influence each other, were open questions that this paper
answers. To do so, we use direct numerical simulations of diffusive stratified
shear flows in a rotating triply-periodic Cartesian domain located at the
equator of a star. We find that either the GSF instability or the shear
instability tends to take over the other in controlling the system, suggesting
that stellar evolution models only need to have a mixing prescription for each
individual instability, together with a criterion to determine which one
dominates. However, we also find that it is not always easy to predict which
instability ""wins"" for given input parameters, because the diffusive shear
instability is subcritical, and only takes place if there is a finite-amplitude
turbulence ``primer'' to seed it. Interestingly, we find that the GSF
instability can in some cases play the role of this primer, thereby providing a
pathway to excite the subcritical shear instability. This can also drive
relaxation oscillations, that may be observable. We conclude by proposing a new
model for mixing in the equatorial regions of stellar radiative zones due to
differential rotation.

industry as a whole to prepare for potentially catastrophic losses. One
approach to modeling operational is the loss distribution approach, which
requires a bank to group operational losses into risk categories and select a
loss frequency and severity distribution for each category. This approach
estimates the annual operational loss distribution, and a bank must set aside
capital, called regulatory capital, equal to the 0.999 quantile of this
estimated distribution. In practice, this approach may produce unstable
regulatory capital calculations from year-to-year as selected loss severity
distribution families change. This paper presents truncation probability
estimates for loss severity data and a consistent quantile scoring function on
annual loss data as useful severity distribution selection criteria that may
lead to more stable regulatory capital. Additionally, the Sinh-arcSinh
distribution is another flexible candidate family for modeling loss severities
that can be easily estimated using the maximum likelihood approach. Finally, we
recommend that loss frequencies below the minimum reporting threshold be
collected so that loss severity data can be treated as censored data.

reduced groupoid C*-algebra. Specifically, we prove that the ideal intersection

that this is equivalent to the uniqueness of equivariant pseudo-expectations. A
key technical idea underlying our results is a new notion of groupoid action on
C*-algebras including the essential groupoid C*-algebra itself. For minimal
groupoids, we further obtain a relative version of Powers averaging property.
Examples arise from suitable group representations into simple groupoid
C*-algebras. This is illustrated by the example of the quasi-regular

key to the usability of MSTs is the projection operation: a more expressive
projection allows more systems to be type-checked but requires a more difficult

operation in MSTs. This allows us to model and type-check many design patterns

  Generation","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2009.01376",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An explainable, efficient and lightweight method for texture generation,
called TGHop (an acronym of Texture Generation PixelHop), is proposed in this
work. Although synthesis of visually pleasant texture can be achieved by deep
neural networks, the associated models are large in size, difficult to explain
in theory, and computationally expensive in training. In contrast, TGHop is
small in its model size, mathematically transparent, efficient in training and
inference, and able to generate high quality texture. Given an exemplary
texture, TGHop first crops many sample patches out of it to form a collection
of sample patches called the source. Then, it analyzes pixel statistics of
samples from the source and obtains a sequence of fine-to-coarse subspaces for
these patches by using the PixelHop++ framework. To generate texture patches
with TGHop, we begin with the coarsest subspace, which is called the core, and
attempt to generate samples in each subspace by following the distribution of
real samples. Finally, texture patches are stitched to form texture images of a
large size. It is demonstrated by experimental results that TGHop can generate
texture images of superior quality with a small model size and at a fast speed.

[Cha20, Cao20, FLV20, For21] which analyze the case where the gauge group is
discrete. In the present case where the gauge group is continuous and Abelian,
the fluctuations of the gauge field decouple into a Gaussian part, related to
the so-called {\em free electromagnetic wave} [Gro83, Dri87], and a gas of {\em
topological defects}. As such, our work gives new quantitative bounds on the

$e^{-2\pi^2\beta}$ to $e^{-\pi^2\beta}$ in the case of the free-energy of the

particles in the events and events in an ensemble of data. We identify power
counting rules and symmetries of minimum bias from which the form of the
squared matrix element can be expanded in symmetric polynomials of the phase

quantities, in contrast to models of heavy ion collisions that rely on
unmeasurable quantities like the number of nucleons participating in the

central ingredient in the understanding of thermalization in isolated quantum
many-body systems. Recently, significant progress has been made analytically by
modeling non-integrable systems as stochastic systems, lacking a Hamiltonian
picture, while honest Hamiltonian dynamics are frequently limited to small
system sizes due to computational constraints. In this paper, we address this
by investigating the role of conservation laws (including energy conservation)
in the thermalization process from an information-theoretic perspective. For
general non-integrable models, we use the equilibrium approximation to show
that the maximal amount of information is scrambled (as measured by the
tripartite mutual information of the time-evolution operator) at late times
even when a system conserves energy. In contrast, we explicate how when a
system has additional symmetries that lead to degeneracies in the spectrum, the
amount of information scrambled must decrease. This general theory is
exemplified in case studies of holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) and
the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Due to the large Virasoro symmetry in 1+1D
CFTs, we argue that, in a sense, these holographic theories are not maximally
chaotic, which is explicitly seen by the non-saturation of the second R\'enyi
tripartite mutual information. The roles of particle-hole and U(1) symmetries
in the SYK model are milder due to the degeneracies being only two-fold, which
we confirm explicitly at both large- and small-$N$. We reinterpret the operator
entanglement in terms the growth of local operators, connecting our results
with the information scrambling described by out-of-time-ordered correlators,
identifying the mechanism for suppressed scrambling from the Heisenberg

different temperatures while preserving the symmetry of the Lagrangian. This
scenario is motivated by mirror dark matter models in which the temperature of
the mirror sector is constrained to be $T'\lesssim0.5 T$ by big bang
nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background. For a given class of
nonminimal kinematic terms, we find that the symmetric field trajectory $X=Y$
is a repeller solution, such that any randomly-occurring asymmetry in the
initial conditions is amplified by many orders of magnitude during inflation,
far beyond what canonical power-law models can achieve. Isocurvature
fluctuations are strongly suppressed in this model, but a $\mathcal
O(0.03$--$0.07$) tensor-to-scalar ratio could be observed in the near future.
The range of potential parameters compatible with {\it Planck} constraints is
shown to be much larger than in corresponding single-field models. This occurs
through a mechanism for lowering the spectral index that we dub CTHC: curved
trajectory at horizon crossing.

observed luminous optical transients: if such CSM is shocked, e.g. by ejecta
expelled from the progenitor during core-collapse, then radiation produced by
the shock-heated CSM can power bright UV/optical emission. If the initial CSM
has an `outer edge' where most of the mass is contained and at which the
optical depth is large, then shock breakout -- when photons are first able to
escape the shocked CSM -- occurs near this outer edge. The $\sim$thin shell of
shocked CSM subsequently expands, and in the ensuing cooling-envelope phase,
radiative and adiabatic losses compete to expend the CSM thermal energy. Here
we derive an analytic solution to the bolometric light-curve produced by such
shocked CSM. For the first time, we provide an analytic solution to the
cooling-envelope phase that is applicable starting from shock-breakout and
until the expanding CSM becomes optically-thin. In particular, we account for
the planar CSM geometry that is relevant at early times and properly treat
radiative losses within this planar phase. We show that these effects can
dramatically impact the resulting light-curves, particularly if the CSM optical
depth is only marginally larger than $c/v_{\rm sh}$ (where $v_{\rm sh}$ is the
shock velocity). This has important implications for interpreting observed fast
optical transients, which have previously been modeled using either
computationally-expensive numerical simulations or more simplified models that
do not properly capture the early light-curve evolution.

result of their persistent motion. In 1D, those clusters do not coalesce
macroscopically and the stationary cluster size distribution (CSD) takes an
exponential form. We develop a minimal lattice model for active particles in
narrow channels to study how clustering is affected by the interplay between
self-propulsion speed diversity and confinement. A mixture of run-and-tumble
particles with a distribution of self-propulsion speeds is simulated in 1D.
Particles can swap positions at rates proportional to their relative
self-propulsion speed. Without swapping, we find that the average cluster size
$L_\text{c}$ decreases with diversity and follows a non-arithmetic power mean
of the single-component $L_\text{c}$'s, unlike the case of tumbling-rate
diversity previously studied. Effectively, the mixture is thus equivalent to a
system of identical particles whose self-propulsion speed is the harmonic mean
self-propulsion speed of the mixture. With swapping, particles escape more
quickly from clusters. As a consequence, $L_\text{c}$ decreases with swapping
rates and depends less strongly on diversity. We derive a dynamical equilibrium
theory for the CSDs of binary and fully polydisperse systems. Similarly to the
clustering behaviour of one-component models, our qualitative results for
mixtures are expected to be universal across active matter. Using literature
experimental values for the self-propulsion speed diversity of unicellular
swimmers known as choanoflagellates, which naturally differentiate into slower
and faster cells, we predict that the error in estimating their $L_\text{c}$
via one-component models which use the conventional arithmetic mean
self-propulsion speed is around $30\%$.

consider the Mean-Field Control (MFC) problem which assumes an asymptotically
infinite population of identical agents that aim to collaboratively maximize
the collective reward. In many cases, solutions of an MFC problem are good
approximations for large systems, hence, efficient learning for MFC is valuable
for the analogous discrete agent setting with many agents. Specifically, we
focus on the case of unknown system dynamics where the goal is to
simultaneously optimize for the rewards and learn from experience. We propose
an efficient model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, $M^3-UCRL$, that
runs in episodes, balances between exploration and exploitation during policy
learning, and provably solves this problem. Our main theoretical contributions
are the first general regret bounds for model-based reinforcement learning for
MFC, obtained via a novel mean-field type analysis. To learn the system's
dynamics, $M^3-UCRL$ can be instantiated with various statistical models, e.g.,
neural networks or Gaussian Processes. Moreover, we provide a practical
parametrization of the core optimization problem that facilitates
gradient-based optimization techniques when combined with differentiable

most likely objects responsible for FRBs, are born not only when young massive
stars undergo core-collapse, but also by mergers of old white dwarfs. We find
that the fractional contribution to the total FRB rate by old stellar
populations is at least a few percent, and the precise fraction can be
constrained by FRB searches in the directions of nearby galaxies, both
star-forming and elliptical ones. Using very general arguments, we show that
the activity time of the M81-FRB object is between 10^4 and 10^6 years, and
more likely of order 10^5 years. The energetics of radio outbursts puts a lower
limit on the magnetic field strength of 10^{13} G, and the spin period > 0.2
sec, thereby ruling out the source being a milli-second pulsar. The upper limit
on the persistent X-ray luminosity (provided by Chandra), together with the

Incorporating derivative observations, however, comes with a dominating
$O(N^3D^3)$ computational cost when training on $N$ points in $D$ input
dimensions. This is intractable for even moderately sized problems. While
recent work has addressed this intractability in the low-$D$ setting, the

paper, we introduce methods to achieve fully scalable Gaussian process
regression with derivatives using variational inference. Analogous to the use
of inducing values to sparsify the labels of a training set, we introduce the
concept of inducing directional derivatives to sparsify the partial derivative

neither on the full dataset size $N$ nor the full dimensionality $D$. We
demonstrate the full scalability of our approach on a variety of tasks, ranging

are at best partial indications, it is hard to resist the feeling that they do
capture some lessons of String Theory. For example, these very tadpole
potentials lead to weak-string-coupling cosmologies that appear to provide
clues on the onset of the inflation from an initial fast roll. The transition,
if accessible to us, would offer a natural explanation for the lack of power
manifested by the CMB at large angular scales. In addition, the same tadpole
potentials can drive spontaneous compactifications to lower-dimensional
Minkowski spaces at corresponding length scales. Furthermore, the cosmological
solutions exhibit an intriguing ""instability of isotropy"" that, if taken at
face value, would point to an accidental origin of compactification. Finally,
symmetric static AdS x S solutions driven by the tadpole potentials also exist,
but they are unstable due to mixings induced by their internal fluxes. On the
other hand, the original Dudas-Mourad solution is perturbatively stable, and we
have gathered some detailed evidence that instabilities induced by internal
fluxes can be held under control in a similar class of weak-coupling type-IIB
compactifications to Minkowski space.

However, the current MZR of local dwarf satellite galaxies (M* <~ 10^8 Msun,

of more massive galaxies (M* >~ 10^9.5 Msun, measured from integrated-light

from integrated light using the Palomar Cosmic Web Imager (PCWI). We compared
the stellar metallicity estimates from integrated light with the measurements

dex at the mass of NGC 147. Therefore, our results tentatively suggest that the

attractive energy-friendly alternative to the Proof-of-Work paradigm. However,
formal barriers to ""getting the incentives right"" were recently discovered,
driven by the desire to use the blockchain itself as a source of
pseudorandomness \cite{brown2019formal}.
  We consider instead a longest-chain Proof-of-Stake protocol with perfect,
trusted, external randomness (e.g. a randomness beacon). We produce two main
results.
  First, we show that a strategic miner can strictly outperform an honest miner
with just $32.5\%$ of the total stake. Note that a miner of this size {\em
cannot} outperform an honest miner in the Proof-of-Work model. This establishes
that even with access to a perfect randomness beacon, incentives in
Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake longest-chain protocols are fundamentally
different.
  Second, we prove that a strategic miner cannot outperform an honest miner
with $30.8\%$ of the total stake. This means that, while not quite as secure as
the Proof-of-Work regime, desirable incentive properties of Proof-of-Work
longest-chain protocols can be approximately recovered via Proof-of-Stake with
a perfect randomness beacon.
  The space of possible strategies in a Proof-of-Stake mining game is {\em
significantly} richer than in a Proof-of-Work game. Our main technical
contribution is a characterization of potentially optimal strategies for a
strategic miner, and in particular, a proof that the corresponding

to the standard Euclidean metric, in particular in the context of textual data

similarity that is suitable for efficient similarity search with many standard
search structures (such as the VP-tree, Cover-tree, and M-tree); show that this
bound is tight and discuss fast approximations for it. We hope that this spurs
new research on accelerating exact similarity search for cosine similarity, and
possible other similarity measures beyond the existing work for distance

distribution of the locations of its agents over the spatial domain. In the
second level, the network is described in terms of the individual positions of
its agents. The aim of the multi-agent network is to attain a spatial
distribution that resembles that of a reference coverage density function
(high-level problem) by means of local (microscopic) interactions of its agents
(low-level problem). In addition, as the agents deploy, they must avoid
collisions with all the obstacles in the region at all times. Our approach
utilizes a modified version of Voronoi tessellations which are comprised of

coverage control while ensuring obstacle avoidance. We consider two control
problems. The first problem which we refer to as the high-level coverage
control problem corresponds to an interpolation problem in the class of
Gaussian mixtures (no collision avoidance requirement), which we solve
analytically. The second problem which we refer to as the low-level coverage

avoidance requirement is now enforced at all times) which is solved by
utilizing Lloyd's algorithm together with the modified Voronoi tessellation

solution of the high-level coverage control problem. Finally, simulation

determined in a weak sense: the supremum probability to win can be approached
via stochastic strategies, but cannot be realized.
  We introduce a class of concurrent games that are determined in a much
stronger sense, and in a way, it is the larger class with this property. To
this end, we introduce the notion of \emph{local interaction} at a state of a
graph game: it is a \emph{game form} whose outcomes (i.e. a table whose
entries) are the next states, which depend on the concurrent actions of the
players. By definition, a game form is \emph{determined} iff it always yields
games that are determined via deterministic strategies when used as a local
interaction in a Nature-free, one-shot reachability game. We show that if all
the local interactions of a graph game with Borel objective are determined game
forms, the game itself is determined: if Nature does not play, one player has a
winning strategy; if Nature plays, both players have deterministic strategies
that maximize the probability to win. This constitutes a clear-cut separation:
either a game form behaves poorly already when used alone with basic
objectives, or it behaves well even when used together with other well-behaved
game forms and complex objectives.
  Existing results for positional and finite-memory determinacy in turn-based
games are extended this way to concurrent games with determined local

diamondlike semiconductor material, using first-principles computations and
analyze the effect of both isotopic disorder as well as length scale
dependence. k of isotopically pure BC5 is computed to be 169 Wm- 1K-1 (along
a-axis) at 300K; this high k is found to be due to the high frequencies and
phonon group velocities of both acoustic and optical phonons owing to the light
atomic mass of Carbon (C) and Boron (B) atoms and strong C-C and B-C bonds. We
also observe a dominance of optical phonons (~ 54%) over acoustic phonons in
heat conduction at higher temperatures (~500 K). This unusually high
contribution of optical phonons is found to be due to a unique effect in BC5
related to a weaker temperature dependence of optical phonon scattering rates
relative to acoustic phonons. The effect is explained in terms of high
frequencies of optical phonons causing decay into other high frequency phonons,
where low phonon populations cause the decay term to become insensitive to
temperature. The effect further leads to high nanoscale thermal conductivity of
77 Wm-1K-1 at 100 nm length scale due to optical phonon meanfreepaths being in
nanometer regime. These results provide avenues for application of BC5 in
nanoscale thermal management.

generates a strong demand for explanations that are robust to noise and align

identifying a subgraph of an input graph that has a strong correlation with the

optimizing the correlation for a single input can easily overfit noise.
Moreover, they do not align well with human intuition because removing an
identified subgraph from an input graph does not necessarily change the
prediction result. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate robust
counterfactual explanations on GNNs by explicitly modelling the common decision
logic of GNNs on similar input graphs. Our explanations are naturally robust to
noise because they are produced from the common decision boundaries of a GNN
that govern the predictions of many similar input graphs. The explanations also
align well with human intuition because removing the set of edges identified by
an explanation from the input graph changes the prediction significantly.
Exhaustive experiments on many public datasets demonstrate the superior

paper considers three methodologies, two for relative-degree 2 and one for

of the constraint function's zero sublevel set. Three special forms of Robust
CBFs (RCBFs) are developed as functions of the input constraints, system
dynamics, and disturbance bounds, such that the resultant RCBF condition on the
control input is always feasible for states in the RCBF zero sublevel set. The
RCBF condition is then enforced in a switched fashion, which allows the system
to operate safely without enforcing the RCBF condition when far from the safe
set boundary and allows tuning of how closely trajectories approach the safe
set boundary. The proposed methods are verified in simulations demonstrating
the developed RCBFs in an asteroid flyby scenario for a satellite with
low-thrust actuators, and in asteroid proximity operations for a satellite with

drive toward an even distribution of electrons in momentum space. Here we show
how such a mechanism avoids the heat death for a charge-density-wave chain in a
strong dc electric field; minibands with nontrivial distribution functions
develop as the current is prematurely driven to zero. We also show how the

probability tends to zero at an appropriate rate, as $n\to\infty$. We identify
the critical window for a host of scale-free random graph models such as the
Norros-Reittu model, Chung-Lu model and generalized random graphs.
Surprisingly, there exists a finite time inside the critical window, after
which, we see a sudden emergence of a tiny giant component. This is a novel
behavior which is in contrast with the critical behavior in other known

vegetation may be detectable from the colors of light it reflects. On the
modern Earth, this spectral reflectance is characterized by an increase in
reflectance between the red and near-infrared wavelengths, a ""red edge"". On
planets orbiting different stellar types, red edge analogs may occur at other
colors than red. Thus, knowing the wavelengths at which photosynthetic
organisms preferentially absorb and reflect photons is necessary to detect red
edge analogs on other planets. Using a numerical model that predicts the
absorbance spectrum of extant photosynthetic pigments on Earth from
Marosv\""olgyi and van Gorkom (2010), we calculate the absorbance spectrum for
pigments on an Earth-like planet around F through late M type stars that are
adapted for maximal energy production. In this model, cellular energy
production is maximized when pigments are tuned to absorb at the wavelength
that maximizes energy input from incident photons while minimizing thermal
emission and costs to build the photosynthetic apparatus. We find that peak
photon absorption for photosynthetic organisms around F type stars tends to be
in the blue while for G, K, and early M type stars, red or just beyond is
preferred. Around the coolest M type stars, these organisms may preferentially
absorb in the near-infrared, possibly past one micron. These predictions are
consistent with previous, qualitative estimates of pigment absorptance. Our
predicted pigment absorbance spectra depend on both the stellar type and
planetary atmospheric composition, especially atmospheric water vapor
concentrations, which alter the availability of surface photons and thus the
predicted pigment absorption. By constraining the absorbance spectra of alien,
photosynthetic organisms, future observations may be better equipped to detect
red edge analogs.

functions. Moreover, the analytical expression of these objective functions may
be unknown. These functions are known as black-boxes, for example, estimating
the generalization error of a machine learning algorithm and computing its
prediction time in terms of its hyper-parameters. Multi-objective Bayesian
optimization (MOBO) is a set of methods that has been successfully applied for
the simultaneous optimization of black-boxes. Concretely, BO methods rely on a
probabilistic model of the objective functions, typically a Gaussian process.
This model generates a predictive distribution of the objectives. However, MOBO
methods have problems when the number of objectives in a multi-objective
optimization problem are 3 or more, which is the many objective setting. In
particular, the BO process is more costly as more objectives are considered,
computing the quality of the solution via the hyper-volume is also more costly
and, most importantly, we have to evaluate every objective function, wasting
expensive computational, economic or other resources. However, as more
objectives are involved in the optimization problem, it is highly probable that
some of them are redundant and not add information about the problem solution.
A measure that represents how similar are GP predictive distributions is
proposed. We also propose a many objective Bayesian optimization algorithm that
uses this metric to determine whether two objectives are redundant. The
algorithm stops evaluating one of them if the similarity is found, saving
resources and not hurting the performance of the multi-objective BO algorithm.
We show empirical evidence in a set of toy, synthetic, benchmark and real
experiments that GPs predictive distributions of the effectiveness of the
metric and the algorithm.

structurally or in atomic composition. In this study, we greatly extend the

in two alumina types: polycrystalline
$\mathrm{\mathrm{\gamma-Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}}$ and amorphous
$\mathrm{a-Al}\mathrm{O_{x}}$. To obtain the dipole moments $p_z$, rather from
the less-structural coupling parameter g, we tune individual TLSs with an
external electric field to extract the $p_z$ of the TLSs in a cavity QED
system. We find a clear difference in the dipole moment distribution from the
film types, indicating a difference in TLS structures. A large sample of
approximately 400 individual TLSs are analyzed from the polycrystalline film
type. Their dipoles along the growth direction $p_z$ have a mean value of
2.6$\pm$0.3 Debye (D) and standard deviation $\sigma$ = 1.6$\pm$0.2 D . The
material distribution fits well to a single Gaussian function. Approximately
200 individual TLSs are analyzed from amorphous films. Both the mean $p_z$
=4.6$\pm$0.5 D and $\sigma$ =2.5$\pm$0.3 D are larger. Amorphous alumina also
has some very large $p_z$, > 8.6 D, in contrast to polycrystalline which has
none of this moment. These large moments agree only with oxygen-based TLS
models. Based on data and the candidate models (delocalized O and
hydrogen-based TLSs), we find polycrystalline alumina has smaller ratio of
O-based to H-based TLS than amorphous alumina.

developed notion of weak fractional derivatives and their associated fractional
order Sobolev spaces. Since fractional derivatives are direction-dependent,
using one-sided fractional derivatives and their combinations leads to new
types of calculus of variations and fractional differential equations as well
as nonstandard Neumann boundary operators. The primary objective of this paper
is to establish the well-posedness and regularities for a class of fractional
calculus of variations problems and their Euler-Lagrange (fractional
differential) equations. This is achieved first for one-sided Dirichlet energy
functionals which lead to one-sided fractional Laplace equations, then for more
general energy functionals which give rise to more general fractional
differential equations.

routines. A regular and stable rhythm is found to be correlated with good
physical and mental health. With the wide adoption of mobile and wearable
technology, many types of sensor data, such as GPS and actigraphy, provide
evidence for researchers to objectively quantify the circadian rhythm of a user
and further use these quantified metrics of circadian rhythm to infer the
user's health status. Researchers in computer science and psychology have
investigated circadian rhythm using various mobile and wearable sensors in
ecologically valid human sensing studies, but questions remain whether and how
different data types produce different circadian rhythm results when
simultaneously used to monitor a user. We hypothesize that different sensor
data reveal different aspects of the user's daily behavior, thus producing
different circadian rhythm patterns. In this paper we focus on two data types:
GPS and accelerometer data from smartphones. We used smartphone data from 225
college student participants and applied four circadian rhythm characterization
methods. We found significant and interesting discrepancies in the rhythmic
patterns discovered among sensors, which suggests circadian rhythms discovered
from different personal tracking sensors have different levels of sensitivity
to device usage and aspects of daily behavior.

Super-Earths is considerably larger when compared to that difference in single
Super-Earths. The metallicity CDFs of hot single Super-Earths versus warm
single Super-Earths indicate different parent stellar populations, while for
Sub-Neptunes this is not the case. The transition radius between Sub-Neptunes
and Sub-Saturns was examined by comparing the APOGEE metallicity distribution
for the Milky Way thin disk in the solar neighborhood with metallicity
distributions of host stars segregated based upon the largest known planet in
their system. These comparisons reveal increasingly different metallicity
distributions as the radius of the largest planet in the systems increases,
with the parent stellar metallicities becoming significantly different for
R$_{p}>$ 2.7 R$_{\oplus}$. The behavior of the p-values as a function of planet
radius undergoes a large slope change at R$_{p}$ = 4.4 $\pm$ 0.5 R$_{\oplus}$,
indicating the radius boundary between small and large planets.

a notoriously hard knowledge-engineering task. A natural approach to solve this
problem is to learn a domain model from observations. However, model learning
approaches frequently do not provide safety guarantees: the learned model may
assume actions are applicable when they are not, and may incorrectly capture
actions' effects. This may result in generating plans that will fail when
executed. In some domains such failures are not acceptable, due to the cost of
failure or inability to replan online after failure. In such settings, all
learning must be done offline, based on some observations collected, e.g., by
some other agents or a human. Through this learning, the task is to generate a
plan that is guaranteed to be successful. This is called the model-free
planning problem. Prior work proposed an algorithm for solving the model-free
planning problem in classical planning. However, they were limited to learning
grounded domains, and thus they could not scale. We generalize this prior work
and propose the first safe model-free planning algorithm for lifted domains. We

processors are the processing engines of smart IoT devices. For decades, these
processors were mainly based on the Arm instruction set architecture (ISA). In
recent years, the free and open RISC-V ISA standard has attracted the attention
of industry and academia and is becoming the mainstream. Data security and user
privacy protection are common challenges faced by all IoT devices. In order to
deal with foreseeable security threats, the RISC-V community is studying
security solutions aimed at achieving a root of trust (RoT) and ensuring that
sensitive information on RISC-V devices is not tampered with or leaked. Many
RISC-V security research projects are underway, but the academic community has
not yet conducted a comprehensive survey of RISC-V security solutions. In order
to fill this research gap, this paper presents an in-depth survey on RISC-V
security technologies. This paper summarizes the representative security
mechanisms of RISC-V hardware and architecture. Based on our survey, we predict
the future research and development directions of RISC-V security. We hope that
our research can inspire RISC-V researchers and developers.

of these two kind of waves depending on the distribution of $u_\pm$. Motivated
by their work, we prove the stability of the above three types of wave patterns

existence and the precise asymptotic behavior of the stationary solution,
especially for the degenerate case: $u_-<u_+=0$ such that the system has
inevitable singularities. The stability of rarefaction wave, stationary

where Jupiter and Saturn's semi-major axes evolve in step-wise manner from
their primordially compact architecture to their present locations. Moreover,
we test multiple different configurations for the primordial system of
terrestrial planets and the Moon-forming projectile, with particular focus on
the almost equal masses impact. We find that the instability/migration of the
giant planets excites the orbits of the terrestrial planets through dynamical
perturbations, thus allowing collisions between them. About 10% of the
simulations lead to a collision with the proto-Earth which resulted in a final
configuration of the terrestrial system that reproduces, to some extent, its
present architecture. Most of these collisions occur in the hit-and-run domain,
but about 15% occur in the partial accretion regime, with the right conditions
for a Moon-forming impact. In most of the simulations, there is a delay of more
than ~20 My between the time of the instability and the Moon-forming impact.
This supports the occurrence of an early instability (< 10 My} after
dissipation of the gas in the proto-planetary disk), compatible with the time
of the Moon-forming impact (30-60 My) inferred from cosmochemical constraints.
In general, the final states of the inner solar system in our simulations show
an excess of Angular Momentum Deficit, mostly attributed to the over-excitation
of Mercury's eccentricity and inclination.

in many domains. Relatively few Bayesian Network structure learning algorithms
account for missing data, and those that do tend to rely on standard approaches
that assume missing data are missing at random, such as the
Expectation-Maximisation algorithm. Because missing data are often systematic,
there is a need for more pragmatic methods that can effectively deal with data
sets containing missing values not missing at random. The absence of approaches
that deal with systematic missing data impedes the application of BN structure
learning methods to real-world problems where missingness are not random. This
paper describes three variants of greedy search structure learning that utilise
pairwise deletion and inverse probability weighting to maximally leverage the
observed data and to limit potential bias caused by missing values. The first
two of the variants can be viewed as sub-versions of the third and best
performing variant, but are important in their own in illustrating the
successive improvements in learning accuracy. The empirical investigations show
that the proposed approach outperforms the commonly used and state-of-the-art

well as both when data are missing at random and not at random.

outer-shell transitions to $6s6p\ ^3P_1$ and $^1P_1$ atomic states and
displayed the structure of a broad doublet and an asymmetric triplet,
respectively. The remaining three higher-frequency bands were assigned to
inner-shell transitions to distinct $J=1$ states arising from the

linewidths. A classical simulation was performed to identify the stability and
symmetry of possible trapping sites in the Ne crystal. It showed that the
overarching 1+2 structure of the high frequency bands could be predominantly
ascribed to crystal field splitting in the axial field of a 10-atom vacancy of

of individual phonon states on an allowed electronic transition was possible

is hard to cool down a He WD to such low temperatures within the Hubble time,
because a thick hydrogen envelope was left behind around the He core after the
mass transfer process. A possible mechanism that can accelerate the WD cooling

the WD cooling with different input parameters, including the neutron star's
spin-down luminosity, the evaporation efficiency and the metallicity of the
companion star. By comparing our results with observations we note that, for
relatively hot He WDs (with $T_{\rm eff}> 7000$ K), standard WD cooling without

position of the quantum layers within the device is an additional parameter
that can strongly influence resonant absorption. However, this effect has so
far received little attention from the photovoltaic community. In this work, we
develop a theoretical framework to evaluate and optimize resonant light
absorption in a thin slab with multiple quantum layers. Using numerical
simulations, we show that the position of the layers can make the difference
between strong absorption enhancement and completely suppressed absorption, and
that an optimal position leads to an absorption enhancement twice larger than
average. We confirm these results experimentally by measuring the absorption
enhancement from photoluminescence spectra in InAs/GaAs quantum dot samples.
Overall, this work provides an additional degree of freedom to substantially
improve absorption, encouraging the development of quantum wells and quantum

two logic states of a SPS qubit here are represented by the vacuum state and
the single-photon state of a cavity, while the two logic states of a CS qubit
are encoded with two coherent states of a cavity. Because of using only one
superconducting qutrit as the coupler, the circuit architecture is
significantly simplified. The operation time for the state transfer does not
increase with the increasing of the number of qubits. When the dissipation of
the system is negligible, the quantum state can be transferred in a
deterministic way since no measurement is required. Furthermore, the
higher-energy intermediate level of the coupler qutrit is not excited during
the entire operation and thus decoherence from the qutrit is greatly
suppressed. As a specific example, we numerically demonstrate that the
high-fidelity transfer of a Bell state of two SPS qubits onto two CS qubits is
achievable within the present-day circuit QED technology. Finally, it is worthy
to note that when the dissipation is negligible, entangled states of n CS

short-range interactions on the scale of its Compton wavelength via the Yukawa
potential. However, in the nonperturbative regime of nonlinear self coupling,
$\phi$ can also mediate larger scale interactions. Moreover, the classical
potential, namely, the static configuration of $\phi$ in the presence of an
external source, is not always unique for given boundary conditions. In this
paper, a complete set of finite-energy potentials (FEPs) induced by a Gaussian
source is identified in one, two, and three spatial dimensions when the
nonlinearity is of the Mexican-hat type, which is often prescribed to induce
spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the size-strength parameter space of the
source, phase boundaries are mapped out, across which the number of FEPs
differ. Additionally, softer phase transitions are delineated according to
whether the potential exhibits a light horizon at which $\phi$ vanishes. The
light horizon is of physical significance when $\phi$ couples with other
particles. For example, when $\phi$ is the Higgs field, all elementary
particles become massless at the light horizon. It is remarkable that white
dwarfs and neutron stars are potentially in a phase where light horizons exist,
whose outer radii are a few times the star sizes. Moreover, suppose elementary
fermions of mass greater than $\sim10^3$ GeV exist, then they may also be
surrounded by light horizons with radii comparable to the Higgs Compton
wavelength. Finally, nonperturbative states may also be realized in condensed
matter systems, wherein phase transitions are controllable using localized
sources.

it to two covariance matrices that were used to analyse the cosmic shear

as a function of bolometric AGN luminosity, revealing that merging plays an
important role in triggering luminous AGN in this sample. However, the merging

  Rotor Model","S.S.Iyer and S.Mondal contributed equally to this work",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In order to understand the dynamics of active matter, we examine a
minimalistic model where interacting spins on a one-dimensional lattice are
driven by a self-propelled spin at the centre with a fixed rotational velocity
$({\omega}_{0})$. The other spins execute rotational Brownian motion by
following the Shore-Zwanzig model of rotational dynamics. The simplicity of the
model allows us to inquire about several relevant microscopic quantities. The
continuous 'active' torque on the central spin is propagated through nearest
neighbour interactions with a uniform coupling parameter, J. We have found a
bounded region in the J-${\omega}_{0}$ plane where the system exhibits 'active
matter like behaviour'. Interestingly, in the limits of large J and
${\omega}_{0}$, we observe a 'slipping behaviour'. The site specific average
rotational velocity of the spin, as one moves away from the central spin
exhibits a nearly exponential decay with distance, allowing the definition of a
correlation length $({\xi})$ which grows rapidly with an increase of the
coupling (J) between the spins. Site specific average velocity exhibits a
change from a single exponential to biexponential decay pattern as the system
enters the active region of the phase diagram, accompanied by a non-monotonic
behavior of the correlation length. We conclude that a macroscopic coherent
state can emerge in the presence of a small concentration of active molecules.
We discuss experimental relevance of our results.

tumor data set with treatment (having considerable variation) and U-net with
Inception backbone for benign tumor data (with minor variation). Loss value and

(FER) performance on linear block codes than conventional normalized MinSum
(NMS) by assigning dynamic multiplicative weights to each check-to-variable
message in each iteration. Previous N-NMS efforts have primarily investigated
short-length block codes (N < 1000), because the number of N-NMS parameters to
be trained is proportional to the number of edges in the parity check matrix
and the number of iterations, which imposes am impractical memory requirement
when Pytorch or Tensorflow is used for training. This paper provides efficient
approaches to training parameters of N-NMS that support N-NMS for longer block
lengths. Specifically, this paper introduces a family of neural 2-dimensional
normalized (N-2D-NMS) decoders with with various reduced parameter sets and
shows how performance varies with the parameter set selected. The N-2D-NMS
decoders share weights with respect to check node and/or variable node degree.
Simulation results justify this approach, showing that the trained weights of
N-NMS have a strong correlation to the check node degree, variable node degree,
and iteration number. Further simulation results on the (3096,1032)

the same FER as N-NMS with significantly fewer parameters required. The

error floor than belief propagation. Finally, a hybrid decoding structure
combining a feedforward structure with a recurrent structure is proposed in

to a magnetic field when the current and the magnetic field are parallel to

stipulates that the electronic dispersion must satisfy certain conditions: it
should either be sufficiently anisotropic or have topological features. The
former results in a positive LMR, while the latter results in a negative LMR.
Here, I propose a different mechanism that leads to LMR in any dispersion
without a need to satisfy the above requirements. The mechanism is quantum in
origin but is applicable in the said regime. It arises due to the change in the
density of states with the magnetic field and is not kinetic in origin.
Remarkably, LMR is found to be negative even if the dispersion is
nontopological, provided it is nonparabolic. An analytical expression is
derived for this contribution to LMR. It is found to depend on the orbital
magnetic susceptibility. The analytical findings are confirmed by numerical
calculations.

Results showed that improvement in CAS detection was observed among all the

  Edit Patterns","Accepted to appear in International Conference on Software
  Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME) 2021",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Software development often involves systematic edits, similar but
nonidentical changes to many code locations, that are error-prone and laborious
for developers. Mining and learning such systematic edit patterns (SEPs) from
past code changes enable us to detect and repair overlooked buggy code that
requires systematic edits.
  A recent study presented a promising SEP mining technique that is based on
program dependence graphs (PDGs), while traditional approaches leverage
syntax-based representations. PDG-based SEPs are highly expressive and can
capture more meaningful changes than syntax-based ones. The next challenge to
tackle is to apply the same code changes as in PDG-based SEPs to other code
locations; detection and repair of overlooked locations that require systematic
edits. Existing program transformation techniques cannot well address this
challenge because (1) they expect many structural code similarities that are
not guaranteed in PDG-based SEPs or (2) they work on the basis of PDGs but are
limited to specific domains (e.g., API migrations).
  We present in this paper a general-purpose program transformation algorithm
for applying PDG-based SEPs. Our algorithm identifies a small transplantable
structural subtree for each PDG node, thereby adapting code changes from
PDG-based SEPs to other locations. We construct a program repair pipeline
Sirius that incorporates the algorithm and automates the processes of mining
SEPs, detecting overlooked code locations (bugs) that require systematic edits,
and repairing them by applying SEPs.
  We evaluated the repair performance of Sirius with a corpus of open source
software consisting of over 80 repositories. Sirius achieved a precision of
0.710, recall of 0.565, and F1-score of 0.630, while those of the
state-of-the-art technique were 0.470, 0.141, and 0.216, respectively.

in audio signals. We describe the individual tones via a parametric model,
training a dictionary to capture the relative amplitudes of the harmonics. The
model parameters are predicted via a U-Net, which is a type of deep neural
network. The network is trained without ground truth information, based on the
difference between the model prediction and the individual time frames of the
short-time Fourier transform. Since some of the model parameters do not yield a
useful backpropagation gradient, we model them stochastically and employ the
policy gradient instead. To provide phase information and account for
inaccuracies in the dictionary-based representation, we also let the network
output a direct prediction, which we then use to resynthesize the audio signals
for the individual instruments. Due to the flexibility of the neural network,
inharmonicity can be incorporated seamlessly and no preprocessing of the input
spectra is required. Our algorithm yields high-quality separation results with
particularly low interference on a variety of different audio samples, both
acoustic and synthetic, provided that the sample contains enough data for the
training and that the spectral characteristics of the musical instruments are
sufficiently stable to be approximated by the dictionary.

dynamic robotic systems has the potential to enable more complex robotic
behaviors -- yet, realizing these controllers is often practically challenging.
To address this challenge, this paper presents the end-to-end realization of
dynamic bipedal locomotion on an underactuated bipedal robot via hybrid zero
dynamics and control Lyapunov functions. A compliant model of Cassie is
represented as a hybrid system to set the stage for a trajectory optimization
framework. With the goal of achieving a variety of walking speeds in all
directions, a library of compliant walking motions is compiled and then
parameterized for efficient use within real-time controllers. Control Lyapunov
functions, which have strong theoretic guarantees, are synthesized to leverage
the gait library and coupled with inverse dynamics to obtain optimization-based
controllers framed as quadratic programs. It is proven that this controller
provably achieves stable locomotion; this is coupled with a theoretic analysis
demonstrating useful properties of the controller for tuning and
implementation. The proposed theoretic framework is practically demonstrated on
the Cassie robot, wherein 3D walking is achieved through the use of
optimization-based torque control. The experiments highlight robotic walking at
different speeds and terrains, illustrating the end-to-end realization of
theoretically justified nonlinear controllers on dynamic underactuated robotic

the audit size and verification are logarithmic in the application circuit

surfaces (IRSs) in massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems to
improve the performance of users in the service dead zone. To reduce the
channel training overhead, we advocate a novel protocol for the uplink
communication in the IRS-assisted massive MIMO systems. Under this protocol,
the IRS reflection coefficients are optimized based on the channel covariance
matrices, which are generally fixed for many coherence blocks, to boost the
long-term performance. Then, given the IRS reflecting coefficients, the BS
beamforming vectors are designed in each coherence block based on the effective
channel of each user, which is the superposition of its direct and reflected
user-IRS-BS channels, to improve the instantaneous performance. Since merely
the user effective channels are estimated in each coherence block, the training
overhead of this protocol is the same as that in the legacy wireless systems
without IRSs. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime that the numbers of IRS
elements and BS antennas both go to infinity with a fixed ratio, we manage to
first characterize the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimators of the user
effective channels and then quantify the closed-form user achievable rates as
functions of channel covariance matrices with channel training overhead and
estimation error taken into account. Interestingly, it is shown that the
properties of channel hardening and favorable propagation still hold for the
user effective channels, and satisfactory user rates are thus achievable even
if simple BS beamforming solutions, e.g., maximal-ratio combining, are
employed. Finally, thanks to the rate characterization, we design a
low-complexity algorithm to optimize the IRS reflection coefficients based on
channel covariance matrices.

the sticky diffusion process by a multidimensional continuous time Markov chain

the CTMC: approximating the infinitesimal generator of the sticky diffusion by
finite difference using standard coordinate directions, and matching the local
moments using the drift and the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix as

the stochastic factors are unbounded but the short rate is sticky at zero.

This strategy also reduces the dimension of the original manifold and
alleviates the curse of dimensionality, which is beneficial for estimation and

data-consistency and structure-consistency are devised to leverage colorization
task better. Specifically, in the training phase, a set of multi-channel

network with denoising score matching. In the inference phase, samples are
iteratively generated via annealed Langevin dynamics with data and structure

cone for which we can implement a small set of tractable (i.e. fast,
numerically stable, analytic) oracles for a logarithmically homogeneous
self-concordant barrier for the cone or for its dual cone. Our extensible, open
source conic interior point solver, Hypatia, allows modeling and solving any
conic optimization problem over a Cartesian product of exotic cones. In this
paper, we introduce Hypatia's interior point algorithm. Our algorithm is based
on that of Skajaa and Ye [2015], which we generalize by handling exotic cones
without tractable primal oracles. With the goal of improving iteration count
and solve time in practice, we propose a sequence of four enhancements to the
interior point stepping procedure of Skajaa and Ye [2015]: (1) loosening the
central path proximity condition, (2) adjusting the directions using a third
order directional derivative barrier oracle, (3) performing a backtracking
search on a curve, and (4) combining the prediction and centering directions.
We implement 23 useful exotic cones in Hypatia. We summarize the complexity of
computing oracles for these cones, showing that our new third order oracle is
not a bottleneck, and we derive efficient and numerically stable oracle
implementations for several cones. We generate a diverse benchmark set of 379
conic problems from 37 different applied examples. Our computational testing
shows that each stepping enhancement improves Hypatia's iteration count and
solve time. Altogether, the enhancements reduce the shifted geometric means of
iteration count and solve time by over 80% and 70% respectively.

existing between different TPCs, hybrid topological interface states of Tamm

presents FedAdapt, an adaptive offloading FL framework to mitigate the
aforementioned challenges. FedAdapt accelerates local training in
computationally constrained devices by leveraging layer offloading of deep

learning based optimization and clustering to adaptively identify which layers
of the DNN should be offloaded for each individual device on to a server to
tackle the challenges of computational heterogeneity and changing network
bandwidth. Experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed and it
is demonstrated that by offloading a DNN from the device to the server FedAdapt
reduces the training time of a typical IoT device by over half compared to
classic FL. The training time of extreme stragglers and the overall training

Photon energies up to several tens of megaelectronvolts are expected, but the

Results published in 2011 by the AGILE team proposed a high-energy component in
TGF spectra extended up to $\approx$100 MeV, which is difficult to reconcile
with the predictions from the Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanche (RREA)
mechanism at the basis of many TGF production models. Here we present a new set
of TGFs detected by the AGILE satellite and associated to lightning
measurements capable to solve this controversy. Detailed end-to-end Monte Carlo
simulations and an improved understanding of the instrument performance under
high-flux conditions show that it is possible to explain the observed
high-energy counts by a standard RREA spectrum at the source, provided that the
TGF is sufficiently bright and short. We investigate the possibility that
single high-energy counts may be the signature of a fine-pulsed time structure
of TGFs on time scales $\approx$4 {\mu}s, but we find no clear evidence for
this. The presented data set and modeling results allow also for explaining the
observed TGF distribution in the (Fluence x duration) parameter space and
suggest that the AGILE TGF detection rate can almost be doubled. Terrestrial

dynamics of the tunneling processes or the phase coherence of the open quantum
system. Here we derive a master equation describing both quantum-electric and
charge degrees of freedom, and discover that typical experimental parameters of
low temperature and yet lower charging energy yield a separation of time scales

different charge states can be taken into account by averaging over the charge

which enables control of the decay rate of a superconducting qubit over four
orders of magnitude by changing the drive amplitude; we find an
order-of-magnitude drop in the qubit excitation in 40 ns and a residual reset
infidelity below $10^{-4}$. Furthermore, for the normal island we consider the
case of charging energy and single-particle level spacing large compared to the
superconducting gap, i.e., a quantum dot. Although the decay rates arising from
such a dot QCR appear low for use in qubit reset, the device can provide
effective negative damping (gain) to the coupled microwave resonator. The Fano

make the recovery result identical to the originally complete image, which is
different from the common generative task emphasizing the naturalness or
realism of generated images. Nevertheless, existing works usually regard it as
a pure generation problem and employ cutting-edge deep generative techniques to
address it. The generative networks can fill the main missing parts with
realistic contents but usually distort the local structures or introduce
obvious artifacts. In this paper, for the first time, we formulate image
inpainting as a mix of two problems, predictive filtering and deep generation.
Predictive filtering is good at preserving local structures and removing
artifacts but falls short to complete the large missing regions. The deep
generative network can fill the numerous missing pixels based on the
understanding of the whole scene but hardly restores the details identical to
the original ones. To make use of their respective advantages, we propose the
joint predictive filtering and generative network (JPGNet) that contains three
branches: predictive filtering & uncertainty network (PFUNet), deep generative
network, and uncertainty-aware fusion network (UAFNet). The PFUNet can
adaptively predict pixel-wise kernels for filtering-based inpainting according
to the input image and output an uncertainty map. This map indicates the pixels
should be processed by filtering or generative networks, which is further fed
to the UAFNet for a smart combination between filtering and generative results.
Note that, our method as a novel inpainting framework can benefit any existing
generation-based methods. We validate our method on three public datasets,
Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA, and demonstrate that our method can enhance
three state-of-the-art generative methods significantly with slightly extra

the transfer-based attack, U3D can universally attack multiple DNN models for

transferability of U3D makes such universal black-box attack easy-to-launch,

given $n$-bit substitution map $P_n: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$, to find
a sequence of reversible logic gates that implements the map. The gate library
adopted in this work consists of multiple-controlled Toffoli gates denoted by
$C^m\!X$, where $m$ is the number of control bits that ranges from 0 to $n-1$.
Controlled gates with large $m \,\,(>2)$ are then further decomposed into
$C^0\!X$, $C^1\!X$, and $C^2\!X$ gates. A primary concern in designing the
algorithm is to reduce the use of $C^2\!X$ gate (also known as Toffoli gate)
which is known to be universal.
  The main idea is to view an $n$-bit substitution map as a rank-$2n$ tensor
and to transform it such that the resulting map can be written as a tensor
product of a rank-($2n-2$) tensor and the $2\times 2$ identity matrix. Let
$\mathcal{P}_n$ be a set of all $n$-bit substitution maps. What we try to find
is a size reduction map $\mathcal{A}_{\rm red}: \mathcal{P}_n \rightarrow
\{P_n: P_n = P_{n-1} \otimes I_2\}$. %, where $I_m$ is the $m\times m$ identity
matrix. One can see that the output $P_{n-1} \otimes I_2$ acts nontrivially on
$n-1$ bits only, meaning that the map to be synthesized becomes $P_{n-1}$. The
size reduction process is iteratively applied until it reaches tensor product
of only $2 \times 2$ matrices.

if $G_{\alpha}$ acts primitively on each of its orbits in $\Omega \setminus
\{\alpha\}$, which is a notion dating back to work of Manning in the 1920s. By
a theorem of Mann, Praeger and Seress, it is known that every extremely
primitive group is either almost simple or affine, and all the almost simple
examples have subsequently been determined. Similarly, Mann et al. have
classified all of the affine extremely primitive groups up to a finite, but
undetermined, collection of groups. Moreover, if one assumes Wall's conjecture
on the number of maximal subgroups of an almost simple group, then there is an
explicit list of candidates, each of which has been eliminated in a recent

approach, which allows us to complete this classification in full generality,
independent of the veracity or otherwise of Wall's conjecture in the almost

show that transitioning from global to local - reducing coverage - allows for
more favourable conditions on the Pareto frontier of fidelity-complexity of a

Linearization is applied to the control of a robotic excavator. In excavation,
a bucket interacts with the surrounding soil in a highly nonlinear and complex

set of linear state equations in a higher-dimensional space. The space of
independent state variables is augmented by adding variables associated with
nonlinear elements involved in the bucket-soil dynamics. These include
nonlinear resistive forces and moment acting on the bucket from the soil, and
the effective inertia of the bucket that varies as the soil is captured into
the bucket. Variables associated with these nonlinear resistive and inertia
elements are treated as additional state variables, and their time evolution is
represented as another set of linear differential equations. The lifted linear
dynamic model is then applied to Model Predictive Contouring Control, where a
cost functional is minimized as a convex optimization problem thanks to the
linear dynamics in the lifted space. The lifted linear model is tuned based on
a data-driven method by using a soil dynamics simulator. Simulation experiments
verify the effectiveness of the proposed lifting linearization compared to its

decision-making in forest management, the maps of BR damages are typically
lacking in forest information systems. We predicted timber volume damaged by BR
at the stand-level in Norway using harvester information of 186,026 stems
(clear-cuts), remotely sensed, and environmental data (e.g. climate and terrain
characteristics). We utilized random forest (RF) models with two sets of
predictor variables: (1) predictor variables available after harvest
(theoretical case) and (2) predictor variables available prior to harvest
(mapping case). We found that forest attributes characterizing the maturity of
forest, such as remote sensing-based height, harvested timber volume and
quadratic mean diameter at breast height, were among the most important
predictor variables. Remotely sensed predictor variables obtained from airborne
laser scanning data and Sentinel-2 imagery were more important than the
environmental variables. The theoretical case with a leave-stand-out
cross-validation achieved an RMSE of 11.4 $m^3ha^{-1}$ (pseudo $R^2$: 0.66)
whereas the mapping case resulted in a pseudo $R^2$ of 0.60. When the spatially
distinct k-means clusters of harvested forest stands were used as units in the
cross-validation, the RMSE value and pseudo $R^2$ associated with the mapping
case were 15.6 $m^3ha^{-1}$ and 0.37, respectively. This indicates that the
knowledge about the BR status of spatially close stands is of high importance
for obtaining satisfactory error rates in the mapping of BR damages.

as related uncertainties, by determining the energies and decay branching
ratios of $^{36}$Ca levels, within the Gamow window, in the 0.5 to 2 GK X-ray
burst temperature range. These properties were studied using the one neutron
pick-up transfer reaction $^{37}$Ca$(p,d)^{36}$Ca in inverse kinematics using a
radioactive beam of $^{37}$Ca at 48 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$. The experiment
performed at GANIL, used the liquid Hydrogen target CRYPTA, the MUST2 detector
array for the detection of the light charged particles and a zero degree
detection system for the outgoing heavy ions. The atomic mass of $^{36}$Ca is
confirmed and new resonances have been proposed together with their proton
decay branching ratios. This spectroscopic information, used in combination
with recent theoretical predictions for the $\gamma$-width, were used to
calculate the $^{35}$K$(p,\gamma)^{36}$Ca reaction rate. The recommended rate
of the present work was obtain within a uncertainty factor of 2 at 1 sigma.
This is consistent, with the previous estimate in the X-ray burst temperature
range. A large increase of the reaction rate was found at higher temperatures
due to two newly discovered resonances. The $^{35}$K$(p,\gamma)^{36}$Ca
thermonuclear reaction rate is now well constrained by the present work in a
broad range of temperatures. Our results show that the
$^{35}$K$(p,\gamma)^{36}$Ca reaction does not affect the shape of the X-ray

global optimization problems. A typical type of thresholding algorithms for
solving such a problem adopts the traditional full steepest descent direction
or Newton-like direction as a search direction to generate an iterate on which
a certain thresholding is performed. Traditional hard thresholding discards a
large part of a vector when the vector is dense. Thus a large part of important
information contained in a dense vector has been lost in such a thresholding
process. Recent study [Zhao, SIAM J Optim, 30(1), pp. 31-55, 2020] shows that
the hard thresholding should be applied to a compressible vector instead of a
dense vector to avoid a big loss of information. On the other hand, the optimal
$k$-thresholding as a novel thresholding technique may overcome the intrinsic
drawback of hard thresholding, and performs thresholding and objective function
minimization simultaneously. This motivates us to propose the so-called partial
gradient optimal thresholding method in this paper, which is an integration of
the partial gradient and the optimal $k$-thresholding technique. The solution
error bound and convergence for the proposed algorithms have been established
in this paper under suitable conditions. Application of our results to the
sparse optimization problems arising from signal recovery is also discussed.
Experiment results from synthetic data indicate that the proposed algorithm

a crucial technique for reducing overall infrastructure costs and increasing
operational efficiencies for operators. More efficient SLA mechanisms are thus
crucial to the success of future networks. In this work, we present ""BEAT"", an
automated, transparent and accountable end-to-end architecture for network

particular type of blockchain, Permissioned Distributed Ledger (PDL), due to
its permissioned nature allowing for industry-compliant SLAs with stringent

Then the primes $l\le x$ distribute as expected in arithmetic progressions mod
$q$, except for a subset of $\mathcal{S}$ whose cardinality is bounded by a
power of $\log x$. We use a $p$-adic variant Harman's sieve to extend Baker's
range to $q\le x^{1/4-\varepsilon}$ if $\mathcal{S}$ is restricted to prime
powers $p^N$, where $p\le (\log x)^C$ for some fixed but arbitrary $C>0$. For
large enough $C$, we thus get an almost all result. Previously, an asymptotic
estimate for $\pi(x;p^N,a)$ of the expected kind, with $p$ being an odd prime,
was established in the wider range $p^N\le x^{3/8-\varepsilon}$ by Barban,
Linnik and Chudakov \cite{BLC}. Gallagher \cite{Gal} extended this range to
$p^N\le x^{2/5-\varepsilon}$ and Huxley \cite{Hux2} improved Gallagher's
exponent to $5/12$. A lower bound of the correct order of magnitude was

range $p^N\le x^{0.4736}$. However, all these results hold for {\it fixed}
primes $p$, and the $O$-constants in the relevant estimates depend on $p$.
Therefore, they do not contain our result. In a part of our article, we

just above TC. Such behavior is well described by Monte Carlo simulations of a
Kondo lattice model, thus supporting the formation of magnetic polarons in
EuB6, which accounts for the resistivity upturn near above TC when lowering the
temperature.

  arXiv:1807.07750",,,,"math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Two ensembles are often used to model random graphs subject to constraints:
the microcanonical ensemble (= hard constraint) and the canonical ensemble (=
soft constraint). It is said that breaking of ensemble equivalence (BEE) occurs
when the specific relative entropy of the two ensembles does not vanish as the
size of the graph tends to infinity. The latter means that it matters for the
scaling properties of the graph whether the constraint is met for every single
realisation of the graph or only holds as an ensemble average. In the
literature, it was found that BEE is the rule rather than the exception for two
classes: sparse random graphs when the number of constraints is of the order of
the number of vertices and dense random graphs when there are two or more
constraints that are frustrated. In the present paper we establish BEE for a
third class: dense random graphs with a single constraint, namely, on the
density of a given finite simple graph. We show that BEE occurs only in a
certain range of choices for the density and the number of edges of the simple
graph, which we refer to as the BEE-phase. We show that, in part of the
BEE-phase, there is a gap between the scaling limits of the averages of the
maximal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the random graph under the two
ensembles, a property that is referred to as spectral signature of BEE. Proofs
are based on an analysis of the variational formula on the space of graphons
for the limiting specific relative entropy derived by Den Hollander et al.
(2018), in combination with an identification of the minimising graphons and
replica symmetry arguments. We show that in the replica symmetric region of the
BEE-phase, as the size of the graph tends to infinity, the microcanonical
ensemble behaves like an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, while the canonical
ensemble behaves like a mixture of two Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs.

behavior sets in. For a metallic system it has been long ago shown by Altshuler
and Shklovskii that the number variance should increase as a power law with a
power dependent only on the dimensionality of the system. Although tantalizing
hints for this behavior have been seen in previous numerical studies, it is
quite difficult to verify this prediction using the standard local unfolding

scree plot (the singular values ranked by their amplitude) and the power law
behavior of the number variance. Thus we are able to numerically verify the
Altshuler and Shklovskii's prediction for disordered $3D$, $4D$, and $5D$
single-electron Anderson models on square lattices in the metallic regime. The

governed by the electric field gradient (EFG) fluctuations at their position.
In classical molecular dynamics (MD), the electron cloud contribution to the
EFG can be included via the Sternheimer approximation, in which the full EFG at
the nucleus that can be computed using quantum DFT is considered to be
proportional to that arising from the external, classical charge distribution.
In this work, we systematically assess the quality of the Sternheimer
approximation as well as the impact of the classical force field (FF) on the
NMR relaxation rates of aqueous quadrupolar ions at infinite dilution. In
particular, we compare the rates obtained using an ab initio parametrized
polarizable FF, a recently developed empirical FF with scaled ionic charges and
a simple empirical non-polarizable FF with formal ionic charges. Surprisingly,
all three FFs considered yield good values for the rates of smaller and less
polarizable solutes, provided that a model-specific Sternheimer parametrization
is employed. Yet, the polarizable and scaled charge FFs yield better estimates
for divalent and more polarizable species. We find that a linear relationship
between the quantum and classical EFGs holds well in all of the cases
considered, however, such an approximation often leads to quite large errors in
the resulting EFG variance, which is directly proportional to the computed
rate. We attempted to reduce the errors by including first order nonlinear
corrections to the EFG, yet no clear improvement for the resulting variance has
been found. The latter result indicates that more refined methods for
determining the EFG at the ion position, in particular those that take into
account the instantaneous atomic environment around an ion, might be necessary
to systematically improve the NMR relaxation rate estimates in classical MD.

detection has become an essential task in design for manufacturability. While
the deployment of pattern matching or machine learning in hotspot detection can
help save significant simulation time, such methods typically demand for
non-trivial quality data to build the model, which most design houses are short
of. Moreover, the design houses are also unwilling to directly share such data
with the other houses to build a unified model, which can be ineffective for
the design house with unique design patterns due to data insufficiency. On the
other hand, with data homogeneity in each design house, the locally trained
models can be easily over-fitted, losing generalization ability and robustness.
In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning framework for
lithography hotspot detection that can address the aforementioned issues. On
one hand, the framework can build a more robust centralized global sub-model
through heterogeneous knowledge sharing while keeping local data private. On
the other hand, the global sub-model can be combined with a local sub-model to
better adapt to local data heterogeneity. The experimental results show that

  Networks via State Decomposition",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we study the problem of consensus-based distributed
optimization where a network of agents, abstracted as a directed graph, aims to
minimize the sum of all agents' cost functions collaboratively. In existing
distributed optimization approaches (Push-Pull/AB) for directed graphs, all
agents exchange their states with neighbors to achieve the optimal solution
with a constant stepsize, which may lead to the disclosure of sensitive and
private information. For privacy preservation, we propose a novel
state-decomposition based gradient tracking approach (SD-Push-Pull) for
distributed optimzation over directed networks that preserves differential
privacy, which is a strong notion that protects agents' privacy against an
adversary with arbitrary auxiliary information. The main idea of the proposed
approach is to decompose the gradient state of each agent into two sub-states.
Only one substate is exchanged by the agent with its neighbours over time, and
the other one is kept private. That is to say, only one substate is visible to
an adversary, protecting the privacy from being leaked. It is proved that under
certain decomposition principles, a bound for the sub-optimality of the
proposed algorithm can be derived and the differential privacy is achieved
simultaneously. Moreover, the trade-off between differential privacy and the
optimization accuracy is also characterized. Finally, a numerical simulation is
provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

one-magnon excitations accompanied by an enhanced magnetocaloric effect for two
singular ratios of the basal interactions $J_1$ and the zigzag interactions

flat-band scenario by applying an appropriate electric field, thus overcoming
the restriction of fine-tuned exchange couplings $J_1$ and $J_2$ and allowing
one to tune more materials towards flat-band physics, that is to show a
macroscopic magnetization jump when crossing the magnetic saturation field, a
residual entropy at zero temperature as well as an enhanced magnetocaloric
effect. While the magnetic field acts on the spin system via the ordinary
Zeeman term, the coupling of an applied electric field with the spins is given
by the sophisticated Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky (KNB) mechanism, where the
electric field effectively acts as a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-spin
interaction. The resulting novel features are corresponding reciprocal effects:
We find a magnetization jump driven by the electric field as well as a jump of
the electric polarization driven by the magnetic field, i.e.\ the system
exhibits an extraordinarily strong magnetoelectric effect. Moreover, in analogy
to the enhanced magnetocaloric effect the system shows an enhanced

particle (mSIMP) scenario using an effective operator approach. As in the
single-component SIMP case, the total relic abundance of mSIMP dark matter (DM)
is determined by the coupling strengths of $3 \to 2$ processes achieved by a
five-point effective operator. Intriguingly, we notice that there is an
irreducible $2 \to 2$ process induced by the corresponding five-point
interaction in the dark sector, which would reshuffle the mass densities of
SIMP DM after the chemical freeze-out. We dub this DM scenario as reshuffled
SIMP ($r$SIMP). Given this observation, we then numerically solve the coupled
Boltzmann equations including the $3 \to 2$ and $2 \to 2$ processes to get the
correct yields of $r$SIMP DM. It turns out that the masses of $r$SIMP DM must
be nearly degenerate for them to contribute sizable abundances. On the other
hand, we also introduce effective operators to bridge the dark sector and
visible sector via a vector portal coupling. Notably, we find that the
reshuffled mechanism in the $r$SIMP scenario is sensitive to the size of the DM

Robin boundary condition on the sphere. The contributions in the Hadamard
function induced by the sphere are explicitly separated and the vacuum
expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor are
investigated for the hyperbolic vacuum. In the flat spacetime limit the latter
is reduced to the conformal vacuum in the Milne universe and is different from
the maximally symmetric Bunch-Davies vacuum state. The vacuum energy-momentum
tensor has a nonzero off-diagonal component that describes the energy flux in
the radial direction. The latter is a purely sphere-induced effect and is
absent in the boundary-free geometry. Depending on the constant in Robin
boundary condition and also on the radial coordinate, the energy flux can be
directed either from the sphere or towards the sphere. At early stages of the
cosmological expansion the effects of the spacetime curvature on the
sphere-induced VEVs are weak and the leading terms in the corresponding
expansions coincide with those for a sphere in the Milne universe. The
influence of the gravitational field is essential at late stages of the
expansion. Depending on the field mass and the curvature coupling parameter,
the decay of the sphere-induced VEVs, as functions of the time coordinate, is
monotonic or damping oscillatory. At large distances from the sphere the
fall-off of the sphere-induced VEVs, as functions of the geodesic distance, is
exponential for both massless and massive fields.

becoming a serious threat to nuclear nonproliferation. This paper presents a
feasibility study on the rapid interrogation of concealed SNMs by combining
scattering and transmission nuclear resonance fluorescence (sNRF and tNRF)
spectroscopy. In sNRF spectroscopy, SNMs such as $^{235, 238}$U are excited by
a wide-band photon beam of appropriate energy and exhibit unique NRF
signatures. Monte Carlo simulations show that one-dimensional scans can realize
isotopic identification of concealed $^{235, 238}$U when the detector array
used for interrogation has sufficiently high energy resolution. The simulated
isotopic ratio $^{235}U/^{238}U$ is in good agreement with the theoretical
value when the SNMs are enclosed in relatively thin iron. This interrogation is
followed by tNRF spectroscopy using a narrow-band photon beam with the goal of
obtaining tomographic images of the concealed SNMs. The reconstructed image
clearly reveals the position of the isotope $^{235}$U inside an iron rod. It is
shown that the interrogation time of sNRF and tNRF spectroscopy is one order of
magnitude lower than that when only tNRF spectroscopy is used and results in a
missed-detection rate of 10$^{-3}$. The proposed method can also be applied for
isotopic imaging of other SNMs such as $^{239, 240}$Pu and $^{237}$Np.

compressions in a suitable way? We formulate this generally as a problem of
optimizing the loss but where the weights are constrained to equal an additive
combination of separately compressed parts; and we give an algorithm to learn
the corresponding parts' parameters. Experimentally with deep neural nets, we
observe that 1) we can find significantly better models in the
error-compression space, indicating that different compression types have
complementary benefits, and 2) the best type of combination depends exquisitely
on the type of neural net. For example, we can compress ResNets and AlexNet
using only 1 bit per weight without error degradation at the cost of adding a
few floating point weights. However, VGG nets can be better compressed by
combining low-rank with a few floating point weights.

(FIR) spectral energy distribution (SED) of the DustPedia galaxies, and its
link with the stellar and dust properties. An interesting aspect of the dust
emission is the inferred FIR colours which could inform us about the dust
content of galaxies, and how it varies with the physical conditions within
galaxies. However, the inherent complexity of dust grains as well as the
variety of physical properties depending on dust, hinder our ability to utilise
their maximum potential. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to explore
new hidden correlations with many relevant physical properties such as the dust
luminosity, dust temperature, dust mass, bolometric luminosity, star-formation
rate (SFR), stellar mass, specific SFR, dust-to-stellar mass ratio, the
fraction of absorbed stellar luminosity by dust (f_abs), and metallicity. We
find that 95% of the variance in our sample can be described by two principal
components (PCs). The first component controls the wavelength of the peak of
the SED, while the second characterises the width. The physical quantities that
correlate better with the coefficients of the first two PCs, and thus control
the shape of the FIR SED are: the dust temperature, the dust luminosity, the
SFR, and f_abs. Finally, we find a weak tendency for low-metallicity galaxies
to have warmer and broader SEDs, while on the other hand high-metallicity
galaxies have FIR SEDs that are colder and narrower.

erases knowledge of earlier tasks. While catastrophic forgetting labels the
problem, the theoretical reasons for interference between tasks remain unclear.
Here, we attempt to narrow this gap between theory and practice by studying
continual learning in the teacher-student setup. We extend previous analytical
work on two-layer networks in the teacher-student setup to multiple teachers.
Using each teacher to represent a different task, we investigate how the
relationship between teachers affects the amount of forgetting and transfer
exhibited by the student when the task switches. In line with recent work, we
find that when tasks depend on similar features, intermediate task similarity
leads to greatest forgetting. However, feature similarity is only one way in
which tasks may be related. The teacher-student approach allows us to
disentangle task similarity at the level of readouts (hidden-to-output weights)
and features (input-to-hidden weights). We find a complex interplay between
both types of similarity, initial transfer/forgetting rates, maximum
transfer/forgetting, and long-term transfer/forgetting. Together, these results
help illuminate the diverse factors contributing to catastrophic forgetting.

been utilized to compress CNNs in recent years. However, since the compression
factor and performance are negatively correlated, the state-of-the-art works
either suffer from severe performance degradation or have relatively low
compression factors. To overcome this problem, we propose to compress CNNs and
alleviate performance degradation via joint matrix decomposition, which is
different from existing works that compressed layers separately. The idea is
inspired by the fact that there are lots of repeated modules in CNNs. By
projecting weights with the same structures into the same subspace, networks
can be jointly compressed with larger ranks. In particular, three joint matrix
decomposition schemes are developed, and the corresponding optimization
approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition are proposed. Extensive
experiments are conducted across three challenging compact CNNs for different
benchmark data sets to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
algorithms. As a result, our methods can compress the size of ResNet-34 by 22X
with slighter accuracy degradation compared with several state-of-the-art
methods.

with the nonlocal light-matter interactions in which the extent of the
center-of-mass wavefunction is comparable to the cavity mode volume in space.
Our approach can be generalized to other optically active 2D materials, opening
the way towards harnessing novel light-matter interaction regimes for

Moreover, using potential outcome notation allows us to state more clearly the

reasonable, and what data should be used in the analysis. We show that

This changes fundamental game-theoretic assumptions about rationality since a
contract can commit a player to act irrationally in specific subgames, making
credible otherwise non-credible threats. This is further complicated by
considering the interaction between multiple contracts which can reason about
each other. This changes the nature of the game in a nontrivial way as choosing
which contract to play can itself be considered a move in the game. Our model
generalizes known notions of equilibria, with a single contract being
equivalent to a Stackelberg equilibrium, and two contracts being equivalent to
a reverse Stackelberg equilibrium. We prove a number of bounds on the
complexity of computing SPE in such games with smart contracts. We show that
computing an SPE is $\textsf{PSPACE}$-hard in the general case. Specifically,
in games with $k$ contracts, we show that computing an SPE is
$\Sigma_k^\textsf{P}$-hard for games of imperfect information. We show that
computing an SPE remains $\textsf{PSPACE}$-hard in games of perfect information
if we allow for an unbounded number of contracts. We give an algorithm for
computing an SPE in two-contract games of perfect information that runs in time
$O(m\ell)$ where $m$ is the size of the game tree and $\ell$ is the number of
terminal nodes. Finally, we conjecture the problem to be $\textsf{NP}$-complete

depleted of electronic charge. Prior to adopting the HG structure, we predict
that sulfur possesses an orthorhombic structure of $Fdd2$ symmetry. We

are important because they have a direct effect on the calculation of thermal
and pressure loads on the substrates, which can lead to material damage under
certain conditions. Direct numerical solution of the radiation transport
equation (RTE) in mesoscale simulations is not viable due to its computational
cost, so for practical applications reduced models are usually employed. To
this end, four approximations for solving the RTE are considered in this work,
ranging from a simple local thermodynamical behaviour consideration, to a more
complex spectral absorption dependent on the arc geometry. Their performance is
initially tested on a one-dimensional cylindrical arc, before implementing them
in a multi-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics code. Results indicate that
inclusion of spectral absorption is necessary in order to obtain consistent
results. However, the approaches accounting for the arc geometry require
repeated solution of the computationally intensive Helmholtz equations, making
them prohibitive for multi-dimensional simulations. As an alternative, a method
using the net emission coefficient is employed, which provides a balance
between computational efficiency and accuracy, as shown by comparisons against

on average more favourable to weak species than even ones. We further show
that, despite the significant dispersion observed among individual models, a
weak species has on average a higher abundance than a strong one if ${\mathcal

solve this question for a large class of processes where temperature is
inferred by measuring a probe (the thermometer) weakly coupled to the sample of
interest, so that the probe's evolution is well described by a quantum
Markovian master equation. Considering the most general control strategy on the
probe (adaptive measurements, arbitrary control on the probe's state and
Hamiltonian), we provide bounds on the achievable measurement precision in a
finite amount of time, and show that in many scenarios these fundamental limits
can be saturated with a relatively simple experiment. We find that for a
general class of sample-probe interactions the scaling of the measurement
uncertainty is inversely proportional to the time of the process, a shot-noise
like behaviour that arises due to the dissipative nature of thermometry. As a
side result, we show that the Lamb shift induced by the probe-sample
interaction can play a relevant role in thermometry, allowing for finite
measurement resolution in the low-temperature regime. More precisely, the
measurement uncertainty decays polynomially with the temperature as
$T\rightarrow 0$, in contrast to the usual exponential decay with $T^{-1}$. We
illustrate these general results for (i) a qubit probe interacting with a
bosonic sample, where the role of the Lamb shift is highlighted, and (ii) a
collective superradiant coupling between a $N$-qubit probe and a sample, which
enables a quadratic decay with $N$ of the measurement uncertainty.

MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ presents an exciting platform for realization of the quantum

applications is its predicted large magnetic gap at the Dirac point (DP).
However, while the early experimental measurements reported on large DP gaps, a
number of recent studies claimed to observe a gapless dispersion of the
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Dirac cone. Here, using micro($\mu$)-laser angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we study the electronic structure of 15 different
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ samples, grown by two different chemists groups. Based on the
careful energy distribution curves analysis, the DP gaps between 15 and 65 meV
are observed, as measured below the N\'eel temperature at about 10-16 K. At
that, roughly half of the studied samples show the DP gap of about 30 meV,
while for a quarter of the samples the gaps are in the 50 to 60 meV range.
Summarizing the results of both our and other groups, in the currently
available MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ samples the DP gap can acquire an arbitrary value
between a few and several tens of meV. Further, based on the density functional
theory, we discuss a possible factor that might contribute to the reduction of
the DP gap size, which is the excess surface charge that can appear due to
various defects in surface region. We demonstrate that the DP gap is influenced
by the applied surface charge and even can be closed, which can be taken
advantage of to tune the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ DP gap size.

separated Ir$^{5+}$ (5$d^4$) ions. But all the detailed experimental as well as
theoretical characterizations reveal that the ground state of Sr$_3$NaIrO$_6$
is not nonmagnetic, rather accommodating a significantly high effective
magnetic moment on Ir$^{5+}$ ion. However our combined dc susceptibility
($\chi$), ${}^{23}$Na nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
muon-spin-relaxation/rotation ($\mu$SR) and heat capacity ($C_p$) measurements
clearly refute any sign of spin-freezing or ordered magnetism among the
Ir$^{5+}$ moments due to geometrical exchange frustration, while in-depth
zero-field (ZF) and longitudinal field (LF) $\mu$SR investigations strongly
point towards inhomogeneous quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL)-like ground
state. In addition, the linear temperature dependence of both the NMR
spin-lattice relaxation rate and the magnetic heat capacity at low temperatures
suggest low-lying gapless spin excitations in the QSOL phase of this material.
Finally, we conclude that the effective SOC realised in $d^4$ iridates are
unlikely to offer a ground state which will be consistent with a purely atomic

of an unjammed region contained within the otherwise jammed suspension.

determinations of the W boson mass, and width. The first and main measurement
relies on the rapid rise of the W-pair production cross section near its
kinematic threshold. This method is extremely simple and clean, involving only
the selection and counting of events, in all different decay channels. An
optimal threshold-scan strategy with a total integrated luminosity of $12\,{\rm
ab}^{-1}$ shared on energy points between 157 and 163 GeV will provide a
statistical uncertainty on the W mass of 0.5 MeV and on the W width of 1.2 MeV.
For these measurements, the goal of keeping the impact of systematic
uncertainties below the statistical precision will be demanding, but feasible.
The second method exploits the W-pair final state reconstruction and kinematic
fit, making use of events with either four jets or two jets, one lepton and
missing energy. The projected statistical precision of the second method is
similar to the first method's, with uncertainties of $\sim 0.5$ ($1$) MeV for
the W mass (width), employing W-pair data collected at the production threshold
and at 240-365 GeV. For the kinematic reconstruction method, the final impact
of systematic uncertainties is currently less clear, in particular
uncertainties connected to the modelling of the W hadronic decays. The use and
interplay of Z$\gamma$ and ZZ events, reconstructed and fitted with the same
techniques as the WW events, will be important for the extraction of W mass

  Welcome",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac1344",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a systematic study of the diffuse hot gas around early-type
galaxies (ETGs) residing in the Virgo cluster, based on archival {\it Chandra}
observations. Our representative sample consists of 79 galaxies with
low-to-intermediate stellar masses ($M_* \approx 10^{9-11}\rm~M_\odot$), a mass
range that has not been extensively explored with X-ray observations thus far.
We detect diffuse X-ray emission in only eight galaxies and find that in five
cases a substantial fraction of the detected emission can be unambiguously
attributed to truly diffuse hot gas, based on their spatial distribution and
spectral properties. For the individually non-detected galaxies, we constrain
their average X-ray emission by performing a stacking analysis, finding a
specific X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm X}/M_* \sim
10^{28}{\rm~erg~s^{-1}~M_{\odot}^{-1}}$, which is consistent with unresolved
stellar populations. The apparent paucity of truly diffuse hot gas in these
low- and intermediate-mass ETGs may be the result of efficient ram pressure
stripping by the hot intra-cluster medium. However, we also find no significant
diffuse hot gas in a comparison sample of 57 field ETGs of similar stellar
masses, for which archival {\it Chandra} observations with similar sensitivity
are available. This points to the alternative possibility that galactic winds
evacuate the hot gas from the inner region of low- and intermediate-mass ETGs,
regardless of the galactic environment. Nevertheless, we do find strong
morphological evidence for on-going ram pressure stripping in two galaxies (NGC
4417 and NGC 4459). A better understanding of the roles of ram pressure
stripping and galactic winds in regulating the hot gas content of ETGs, invites
sensitive X-ray observations for a large galaxy sample.

has the potential to reduce traffic congestion and emissions, increase
mobility, and improve public health. To convince people to commute by bike, the
infrastructure plays an important role, since safety is one of the primary
concerns of potential cyclists. This paper presents a method to find the best
way to improve the safety of a bicycle network for a given budget and maximize
the number of riders that could now choose bicycles for their commuting needs.
This optimization problem is formalized as the Bicycle Network Improvement
Problem (BNIP): it selects which roads to improve for a set of traveler
origin-destination pairs, taking both safety and travel distance into account.
The BNIP is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes a
piecewise linear penalty function of route deviations of travelers. The MIP is
solved using Benders decomposition to scale to large instances. The paper also
presents an in-depth case study for the Midtown area in Atlanta, GA, using

dissipative, meaning that $f$ strongly forces solutions toward finite values.
This result demonstrates the role that the deterministic forcing term $f$ plays
in preventing explosion.

scenarios, under different environmental conditions while facing a variety of
semantic concepts, including unknown ones. To this end, recent works tried to
empower visual object recognition methods with the capability to i) detect
unseen concepts and ii) extended their knowledge over time, as images of new
semantic classes arrive. This setting, called Open World Recognition (OWR), has
the goal to produce systems capable of breaking the semantic limits present in
the initial training set. However, this training set imposes to the system not
only its own semantic limits, but also environmental ones, due to its bias
toward certain acquisition conditions that do not necessarily reflect the high
variability of the real-world. This discrepancy between training and test
distribution is called domain-shift. This work investigates whether OWR
algorithms are effective under domain-shift, presenting the first benchmark
setup for assessing fairly the performances of OWR algorithms, with and without
domain-shift. We then use this benchmark to conduct analyses in various
scenarios, showing how existing OWR algorithms indeed suffer a severe
performance degradation when train and test distributions differ. Our analysis
shows that this degradation is only slightly mitigated by coupling OWR with
domain generalization techniques, indicating that the mere plug-and-play of
existing algorithms is not enough to recognize new and unknown categories in
unseen domains. Our results clearly point toward open issues and future
research directions, that need to be investigated for building robot visual
systems able to function reliably under these challenging yet very real

While the system is relatively well understood for the case of non-moving
porous media, the situation when the elastic matrix can move and deform, is
much more complex. In this paper we derive the equations of motion for the
dynamics of a deformable porous media which includes the effects of friction
forces, stresses, and heat exchanges between the media, by using the new
methodology of variational approach to thermodynamics. This theory extends the
recently developed variational derivation of the mechanics of deformable porous
media to include thermodynamic processes and can easily include
incompressibility constraints. The model for the combined fluid-matrix system,
written in the spatial frame, is developed by introducing mechanical and
additional variables describing the thermal energy part of the system, writing
the action principle for the system, and using a nonlinear, nonholonomic
constraint on the system deduced from the second law of thermodynamics. The
resulting equations give us the general version of possible friction forces
incorporating thermodynamics, Darcy-like forces and friction forces similar to
those used in the Navier-Stokes equations. The equations of motion are valid
for arbitrary dependence of the kinetic and potential energies on the state
variables. The results of our work are relevant for geophysical applications,
industrial applications involving high pressures and temperatures, food

optimum of the compliance minimization problem, we employ analytical tools to
investigate how intermediate density penalization affects the convexity of the

techniques, how continuation methods can be used to approach the global
optimum, and how the initial guess has some weight in determining the final

transport properties distinguish it from the conventional, double Weyl merging.

disorders. Recently, numerous data-driven deep learning models have been
proposed for automatic sleep staging. They mainly train the model on a large
public labeled sleep dataset and test it on a smaller one with subjects of
interest. However, they usually assume that the train and test data are drawn
from the same distribution, which may not hold in real-world scenarios.
Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) has been recently developed to handle this
domain shift problem. However, previous UDA methods applied for sleep staging
have two main limitations. First, they rely on a totally shared model for the
domain alignment, which may lose the domain-specific information during feature
extraction. Second, they only align the source and target distributions
globally without considering the class information in the target domain, which
hinders the classification performance of the model while testing. In this
work, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework called ADAST to tackle
the domain shift problem in the unlabeled target domain. First, we develop an
unshared attention mechanism to preserve the domain-specific features in both
domains. Second, we design an iterative self-training strategy to improve the
classification performance on the target domain via target domain pseudo
labels. We also propose dual distinct classifiers to increase the robustness
and quality of the pseudo labels. The experimental results on six cross-domain
scenarios validate the efficacy of our proposed framework and its advantage
over state-of-the-art UDA methods. The source code is available at

theorem in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we show that every $(s,t)$-Furstenberg set $K

with $s > \tfrac{1}{2}$ and $t \geq 1 + \epsilon$ for a small absolute constant
$\epsilon > 0$. We also prove a higher dimensional analogue of this estimate
for codimension-1 Furstenberg sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. As another corollary of
our method, we obtain a $\delta$-discretised sum-product estimate for
$(\delta,s)$-sets. Our bound improves on a previous estimate of Chen for every
$\tfrac{1}{2} < s < 1$, and also of Guth-Katz-Zahl for $s \geq 0.5151$.

subsequently closing pores, we find that the breakdown of the permeability

The pressure jumps that occur during the obstruction process also follow a

  Long-range concentration fluctuations and the role of attractive interactions",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We compute partial structure factors, Kirkwood-Buff integrals (KBIs) and
chemical potentials of model supercooled liquids with and without attractive
interactions. We aim at investigating whether relatively small differences in
the tail of the radial distribution functions result in contrasting
thermodynamic properties. Our results suggest that the attractive potential
favours the nucleation of long-range structures. Indeed, upon decreasing
temperature, Bathia-Thornton structure factors display anomalous behaviour in
the $k\to 0$ limit. KBIs extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit confirm this
picture, and excess coordination numbers identify the anomaly with long-range
concentration fluctuations. By contrast, the purely repulsive system remains
perfectly miscible for the same temperature interval and only reveals
qualitatively similar concentration fluctuations in the crystalline state.
Furthermore, differences in both isothermal compressibilities and chemical
potentials show that thermodynamics is not entirely governed by the short-range
repulsive part of the interaction potential, emphasising the nonperturbative
role of attractive interactions. Finally, at higher density, where both systems
display nearly identical dynamical properties and repulsive interactions become
dominant, the anomaly disappears, and both systems also exhibit similar
thermodynamic properties.

train artificial neural networks (ANNs) with rectified linear unit (ReLU)

(GFs) associated to the training of ANNs with ReLU activation and most of the
key difficulties in the mathematical convergence analysis of GD type
optimization schemes in the training of ANNs with ReLU activation seem to be
already present in the dynamics of the corresponding GF differential equations.
It is the key subject of this work to analyze such GF differential equations in
the training of ANNs with ReLU activation and three layers (one input layer,
one hidden layer, and one output layer). In particular, in this article we
prove in the case where the target function is possibly multi-dimensional and
continuous and in the case where the probability distribution of the input data
is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure that the risk of
every bounded GF trajectory converges to the risk of a critical point. In
addition, in this article we show in the case of a 1-dimensional affine linear
target function and in the case where the probability distribution of the input
data coincides with the standard uniform distribution that the risk of every
bounded GF trajectory converges to zero if the initial risk is sufficiently
small. Finally, in the special situation where there is only one neuron on the
hidden layer (1-dimensional hidden layer) we strengthen the above named result
for affine linear target functions by proving that that the risk of every (not
necessarily bounded) GF trajectory converges to zero if the initial risk is
sufficiently small.

electrical transductions are limited in frequency, which limits the achievable

have been demonstrated to be easily exploitable by adversarial road users

Adversarial Mixture Density Networks (AMDN), which learns two distributions
from separate datasets. The first is a distribution of safe actions learned

penalising the safe action distribution based on its similarity to the unsafe
action distribution when training on the collision dataset, a more robust and

testing environments. We show that despite its simplicity, AMDN provides
significant benefits for the safety of the learned control policy, when

discover an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) with a central surface brightness of
$\mu_{0,g}\sim26$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and effective radius $R_e\sim3.8$ kpc. This
UDG, named UDG32, is one of the faintest and most diffuse low-surface
brightness galaxies in the Hydra~I cluster. Based on the available data, we
cannot exclude that this object is just seen in projection on top of the
stellar filaments, thus being instead a foreground or background UDG in the
cluster. However, the clear spatial coincidence of UDG32 with the stellar
filaments of NGC3314A suggests that it might have formed from the material in
the filaments, becoming a detached, gravitationally bound system. In this
scenario, the origin of UDG32 depends on the nature of the stellar filaments in
NGC3314A, which is still unknown. They could result from ram-pressure stripping
or have a tidal origin. In this letter, we focus on the comparison of the

their possible origin. The relatively red color ($g-r=0.54 \pm 0.14$~mag) of
the UDG, similar to that of the disk in NGC3314A, combined with an age older

Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques to learn control policies that
are robust against adversaries. We introduce Adversarially Robust Control
(ARC), which trains the protagonist policy and the adversarial policy
end-to-end on the same loss. The aim of the protagonist is to maximise this
loss, whilst the adversary is attempting to minimise it. We demonstrate the
proposed ARC training in a highway driving scenario, where the protagonist
controls the follower vehicle whilst the adversary controls the lead vehicle.
By training the protagonist against an ensemble of adversaries, it learns a
significantly more robust control policy, which generalises to a variety of
adversarial strategies. The approach is shown to reduce the amount of
collisions against new adversaries by up to 90.25%, compared to the original
policy. Moreover, by utilising an auxiliary distillation loss, we show that the
fine-tuned control policy shows no drop in performance across its original
training distribution.

spin coherence time of Er$^{3+}$$:$Y$_2$SiO$_5$ is so far limited to several
microseconds, and there are significant challenges in optimizing coherence
lifetimes simultaneously for both the electron and nuclear spins. Here we
perform a pulsed-electron-nuclear-double-resonance investigation for an
Er$^{3+}$-doped material at subkelvin temperatures. At the lowest working
temperature, the electron spin coherence time reaches 290 $\pm$ 17 $\mu$s,
which has been enhanced by 40 times compared with the previous results. In the
subkelvin regime, a rapid increase in the nuclear spin coherence time is
observed, and the longest coherence time of 738 $\pm$ 6 $\mu$s is obtained.
These extended coherence lifetimes could be valuable resources for further
applications of Er$^{3+}$$:$Y$_2$SiO$_5$ in fiber-based quantum networks.

angular momentum (TKAM) as a new form of angular momentum. TKAM is conserved in
nonlinear atomic processes such as high harmonic generation and can be
classified by a time delay parameter $\tau$ and a coordination parameter
$\gamma$. These parameters are defined by the respective projected orbital
angular momentum and the energy of the two superimposed Laguerre-Gaussian
beams. We derive a consistent geometric method to determine $\tau$ and $\gamma$
from the driving beam as well as from the high harmonic radiation. This method
relates both invariance parameters ($\tau$ and $\gamma$) to the emitted high
harmonic radiation. Therefore, $\tau$ and $\gamma$ can be read off of two
different torus knots. These knots can be constructed from the spatio-temporal
evolution of the electric field of the respective high harmonic radiation or
the driving beam. We demonstrate the classification of the invariance
parameters for a planar atomic gas target irradiated by bicircular
Laguerre-Gaussian beams explicitly. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
respective torus knots determined by $\tau$ and $\gamma$ can be mapped onto
each other within minor modifications. This geometric method yields a different
way to interpret the invariance parameters $\tau$ and $\gamma$ as well as their
underlying relation compared to a purely formal derivation. The investigations
presented in this work are in good agreement with previous findings and provide
insight into the dynamical symmetry of TKAM in the context of high harmonic

introduces spatial patterns of embryonic and extra-embryonic precursor cells.
The transcription factors NANOG and GATA6 are the earliest markers for the two
cell types and interact between cells via the fibroblast growth factor
signaling pathway. Computational models have been used to mimic the patterns
and cell type proportions found in experimental studies. However, these models
are always phenomenological in nature and lack a proper physical explanation.
We derive a cell fate decision model motivated by the ideas of statistical
mechanics. The model incorporates intra- and intercellular interactions of
NANOG and GATA6. A detailed mathematical analysis on the resulting dynamical
system is presented. We find that our model is capable of generating tissue
wide spatial patterns of the two cell types. Its advantages are revealed in the
simple physical and biological interpretation of the parameters and their
interactions. In numerical simulations, we showcase the ability to replicate
checkerboard patterns of different cell type proportions varying only a single
parameter. The tight control of the system as well as the ease of use and the
direct expandability to other signaling types provide solid reasons for the
continued use of our model. We are convinced that our approach presents an
exciting perspective in relation to cell fate decisions. Moreover, the concepts
are generalizable to questions regarding cell signaling beyond the mammalian

large-scale damped oscillations with amplitudes of the order of an Earth

devices (MD), which are predicated on a concoction of economic and policy
forces (e.g., supply/demand, crises, patents). Assuming that the number of FDA
MD (Premarketing Notifications (PMN), Approvals (PMAs), and their sum)
Applications behaves similarly to those of other econometrics, this work
explores the hypothesis of the existence (and, if so, the length scale(s)) of
economic cycles (periodicities). Methods: Beyond summary statistics, the
monthly (May, 1976 to December, 2020) number of observed FDA MD Applications
are investigated via an assortment of time series techniques (including:
Discrete Wavelet Transform, Running Moving Average Filter (RMAF), Complete
Ensemble Empirical Mode with Adaptive Noise decomposition (CEEMDAN), and
Seasonal Trend Loess (STL) decomposition) to exhaustively search and
characterize such periodicities. Results: The data were found to be non-normal,
non-stationary (fractional order of integration < 1), non-linear, and strongly
persistent (Hurst > 0.5). Importantly, periodicities exist and follow seasonal,
1 year short-term, 5-6 year (Juglar), and a single 24-year medium-term
(Kuznets) period (when considering the total number of MD Applications).
Economic crises (e.g., COVID-19) do not seem to affect the evolution of the
periodicities. Conclusions: This work concludes that (1) PMA and PMN data may
be viewed as a proxy measure of the MD industry; (2) periodicities exists in
the data with time lengths associated with seasonal/1-year, Juglar and Kuznets
affects; (4) these metrics do not seem affected by specific crises (such as
COVID-19) (similarly with other econometrics used in periodicity assessments);
(5) PMNs and PMAs evolve inversely and suggest a structural industrial
transformation; (6) Total MDs are predicted to continue their decline into the
mid-2020s prior to recovery.

to study the performance of several search algorithms to select a suitable one.
The proper search algorithm will be used to develop an automatic focus system

  materials",,,,,"physics.comp-ph cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Fractional calculus has been proved to be very effective in representing the
visco-elastic relaxation response of materials with memory such as polymers.
Moreover, in modelling the temperature dependency of the material functions in
thermo-visco-elasticity, the standard time-temperature superposition principle
is known to be ineffective in most of the cases (thermo-rehological
complexity). In this work, a novel finite element formulation and numerical
implementation is proposed for the simulation of transient thermal analysis in
thermo-rehologically complex materials. The parameters of the visco-elastic
fractional constitutive law are assumed to be temperature dependent functions
and an internal history variable is introduced to track the changes in
temperature which are responsible for the phase transition of the material. The
numerical approximation of the fractional derivative is employed via the so
called Gr\""unwald-Letnikov approximation. The proposed model is used to
numerically solve some test cases related to relaxation and creep tests
conducted on a real polymer (Etylene Vynil Acetate), which is used as the major
encapsulant of solar cells in photovoltaics.

together with two finitely generated differential extensions $L$ and $M$ of
$K$, an important problem in differential algebra is to exhibit a common
differential extension $N$ in order to define the new differential extensions
$L\cap M$ and the smallest differential field $(L,M)\subset N$ containing both
$L$ and $M$. Such a result allows to generalize the use of complex numbers in
classical algebra. Having now two finitely generated differential modules $L$
and $M$ over the non-commutative ring ring $D=K[d_1,... ,d_n]=K[d]$ of
differential operators with coefficients in $K$, we may similarly look for a
differential module $N$ containing both $L$ and $M$ in order to define $L\cap
M$ and $L+M$. This is {\it exactly} the situation met in linear or non-linear
OD or PD control theory by selecting the inputs and the outputs among the
control variables. However, in many recent books and papers, we have shown that
controllability was a {\it built-in} property of a control system, not
depending on the choice of inputs and outputs. The main purpose of this paper
is to revisit control theory by showing the specific importance of the two
previous problems and the part plaid by $N$ in both cases for the
parametrization of the control system. The essential tool will be the study of
{\it differential correspondences}, a modern name for what was called {\it
B\""{a}cklund problem} during the last century, namely the study of elimination
theory for groups of variables among systems of linear or nonlinear OD or PD
equations. The difficulty is to revisit {\it differential homological algebra}
by using non-commutative localization. Finally, when $M$ is a $D$-module, this
paper is using for the first time the fact that the system $R=hom_K(M,K)$ is a
$D$-module for the Spencer operator acting on sections.

radial metric potentials which decomposes the system of non-linear field
equations into two arrays: one set corresponding to seed source and the other
one involves additional source terms. The domain of the isotropic solution is
extended in the background of $f(R)$ Starobinsky model by employing the metric
potentials of Krori-Barua spacetime. We determine two anisotropic solutions by
employing some physical constraints on the extra source. The values of unknown

inspect the physical viability, equilibrium and stability of the obtained
solutions corresponding to the star Her X-I. It is observed that one of the two

incapacitated to be able to call for help. And it's usually too late before the
first responders arrive on-scene. Currently, a vast array of 'safety' devices
available in the market are often far too rudimentary such as double tapping
the power button that isn't very practical, or an app on a smart watch that is
a huge investment in the first place. The Smart Band aims to eliminate the need
for a physical trigger by the person who finds himself in dangerous situations
like kidnapping, front-facing some wild animal, heart attack, etc., and rather
senses the heartbeat. The Smart Band is designed as a personalized wearable
device, wherein the user heart beat rate is collected and trained using machine
learning algorithm, which triggers the alert system automatically when the
event is identified. Hence the accuracy of assessing emergency situation will
be high and false rate will be reduced. As soon as the event is detected, the
band relays GPS coordinates to first responders and emergency contacts, which
will be sent via the Network Carrier (SIM card module) directly from the band,
not relying on a mobile phone, which is usually out of reach during such
emergency situations. In essence, the Smart Band consists of a GPS tracker, a
heartbeat sensor, a Network module, and a Bluetooth module, all existing
technologies which have been mass produced to an extent that the end product
can be made affordable, and in huge quantities as well. On further development
the smart band can be customized to a finely wearable jewel which can serve the
purpose autonomously.

for point cloud decomposition into basic geometric shapes namely, plane,
sphere, cone and cylinder. We show improved performance of 3D object
classification using attention features based on primitive shapes in point
clouds. Point clouds, being the simple and compact representation of 3D objects
have gained increasing popularity. They demand robust methods for feature
extraction due to unorderness in point sets. In ABD-Net the proposed Local
Proximity Encapsulator captures the local geometric variations along with
spatial encoding around each point from the input point sets. The encapsulated
local features are further passed to proposed Attention Feature Encoder to
learn basic shapes in point cloud. Attention Feature Encoder models geometric
relationship between the neighborhoods of all the points resulting in capturing
global point cloud information. We demonstrate the results of our proposed
ABD-Net on ANSI mechanical component and ModelNet40 datasets. We also
demonstrate the effectiveness of ABD-Net over the acquired attention features
by improving the performance of 3D object classification on ModelNet40
benchmark dataset and compare them with state-of-the-art techniques.

Large quantity of pixel-level annotation is required to train deep networks for
semantic segmentation. Earth observation techniques are applied to varieties of
applications and since classes vary widely depending on the applications,
therefore, domain knowledge is often required to label Earth observation
images, impeding availability of labeled training data in many Earth
observation applications. To tackle these challenges, in this paper we propose
an unsupervised semantic segmentation method that can be trained using just a
single unlabeled scene. Remote sensing scenes are generally large. The proposed
method exploits this property to sample smaller patches from the larger scene
and uses deep clustering and contrastive learning to refine the weights of a
lightweight deep model composed of a series of the convolution layers along
with an embedded channel attention. After unsupervised training on the target
image/scene, the model automatically segregates the major classes present in
the scene and produces the segmentation map. Experimental results on the
Vaihingen dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

advantage in saving life and property. Implementing pre-emption can aid in
achieving it. EVs get unobstructed movement via pre-emption, usually by
altering traffic signals and giving a green wave throughout the route. This
approach of absolute pre-emption effects adversely on regular traffic by
imposing unnecessary waiting. In this paper, we propose a novel emergency
vehicle pre-emption (EVP) algorithm implemented in the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network
(VANET) that can reduce the imposed undesirable waiting time, but still
ascertains EVs meet target response time. We introduce mixed-criticality
real-time system scheduling concept where different level of emergencies is
mapped with different criticality levels and assign certain success assurance
level to respective criticality. We implemented the EVP algorithm for an
arterial traffic network and leveraged the use of valuable information that
gets transmitted via VANET to make critical decisions. The proposed algorithm
can significantly reduce the average waiting time of regular traffic. It also
ascertains all EVs with different level of criticality meet target response
time respective to their assurance level.
