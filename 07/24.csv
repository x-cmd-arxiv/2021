  Optimization","IEEE TSP",,"10.1109/TSP.2023.3239799",,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we introduce ADAPD, $\textbf{A}$
$\textbf{D}$ecentr$\textbf{A}$lized $\textbf{P}$rimal-$\textbf{D}$ual
algorithmic framework for solving non-convex and smooth consensus optimization
problems over a network of distributed agents. The proposed framework relies on
a novel problem formulation that elicits ADMM-type updates, where each agent
first inexactly solves a local strongly convex subproblem with any method of
its choice and then performs a neighbor communication to update a set of dual
variables. We present two variants that allow for a single gradient step for
the primal updates or multiple communications for the dual updates, to exploit
the tradeoff between the per-iteration cost and the number of iterations. When
multiple communications are performed, ADAPD can achieve theoretically optimal
communication complexity results for non-convex and smooth consensus problems.
Numerical experiments on several applications, including a deep-learning one,
demonstrate the superiority of ADAPD over several popularly used decentralized
methods.

uninformed, where an attacker only has access to the graph structure, but no
information about node attributes. Here the attacker aims to exploit structural
knowledge and assumptions, which GNN models make about graph data. In
particular, literature has shown that structural node centrality and similarity
have a strong influence on learning with GNNs. Therefore, we study the impact
of centrality and similarity on adversarial attacks on GNNs. We demonstrate
that attackers can exploit this information to decrease the performance of GNNs
by focusing on injecting links between nodes of low similarity and,
surprisingly, low centrality. We show that structure-based uninformed attacks
can approach the performance of informed attacks, while being computationally
more efficient. With our paper, we present a new attack strategy on GNNs that
we refer to as Structack. Structack can successfully manipulate the performance
of GNNs with very limited information while operating under tight computational
constraints. Our work contributes towards building more robust machine learning
approaches on graphs.

Indeed, it has often been observed that phenomena exhibited by real-world

example, by Betti numbers or simplex counts. As it is often computationally
expensive (or even unfeasible) to determine such topological features exactly,
it would be extremely valuable to have pseudometrics on the set of directed
graphs that can both detect the topological differences and be computed
efficiently.
  To facilitate work in this direction, we introduce methods to measure how
well a graph pseudometric captures the topology of a directed graph. We then
use these methods to evaluate some well-established pseudometrics, using test
data drawn from several families of random graphs.

A
trust assumption specifies the failures that a system, such as a blockchain
network, can tolerate and determines the conditions under which it operates
correctly. In systems subject to Byzantine faults, the trust assumption is
usually specified through sets of processes that may fail together. Trust has
traditionally been symmetric, such that all processes in the system adhere to
the same, global assumption about potential faults. Recently, asymmetric trust
models have also been considered, especially in the context of blockchains,
where every participant is free to choose who to trust.
  In both cases, it is an open question how to compose trust assumptions.
Consider two or more systems, run by different and possibly disjoint sets of
participants, with different assumptions about faults: how can they work
together? This work answers this question for the first time and offers
composition rules for symmetric and for asymmetric quorum systems. These rules
are static and do not require interaction or agreement on the new trust
assumption among the participants. Moreover, they ensure that if the original
systems allow for running a particular protocol (guaranteeing consistency and
availability), then so will the joint system. At the same time, the composed
system tolerates as many faults as possible, subject to the underlying
consistency and availability properties.
  Reaching consensus with asymmetric trust in the model of personal Byzantine
quorum systems (Losa et al., DISC 2019) was shown to be impossible, if the
trust assumptions of the processes diverge from each other. With asymmetric
quorum systems, and by applying our composition rule, we show how consensus is
actually possible, even with the combination of disjoint sets of processes.

policy that adaptively selects a group of items, each selection is based on the
feedback from the past, in order to maximize the expected utility of selected
items. It has been shown that the utility functions of many real-world
applications are adaptive submodular. However, most of existing studies on
adaptive submodular optimization focus on the average-case. Unfortunately, a
policy that has a good average-case performance may have very poor performance
under the worst-case realization. In this study, we propose to study two
variants of adaptive submodular optimization problems, namely, worst-case
adaptive submodular maximization and robust submodular maximization. The first
problem aims to find a policy that maximizes the worst-case utility and the
latter one aims to find a policy, if any, that achieves both near optimal
average-case utility and worst-case utility simultaneously. We introduce a new
class of stochastic functions, called \emph{worst-case submodular function}.
For the worst-case adaptive submodular maximization problem subject to a
$p$-system constraint, we develop an adaptive worst-case greedy policy that
achieves a $\frac{1}{p+1}$ approximation ratio against the optimal worst-case
utility if the utility function is worst-case submodular. For the robust
adaptive submodular maximization problem subject to cardinality constraints
(resp. partition matroid constraints), if the utility function is both
worst-case submodular and adaptive submodular, we develop a hybrid adaptive
policy that achieves an approximation close to $1-e^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ (resp.
$1/3$) under both worst- and average-case settings simultaneously. We also
describe several applications of our theoretical results, including pool-base
active learning, stochastic submodular set cover and adaptive viral marketing.

contributing significantly to galaxy energy budgets and acting as a regulator
of star formation. Despite this, little is understood about ISM turbulence
empirically. In the Milky Way, multiple tracers are used to reconstruct the
density- and velocity-fluctuation power spectra over an enormous range of
scales, but questions remain on the nature of these fluctuations at the
smallest scales. Even less is known about the ISM of distant galaxies, where
only a few tracers of turbulence, such as non-thermal broadening of optical
recombination lines, are accessible. We explore the use of radio-wave
scattering of fast radio bursts (FRBs) to add a second probe of turbulence in
extragalactic galaxies on scales many orders of magnitude smaller than those
probed by emission-line widths. We first develop the formalism to compare the
scattering measures of FRBs to alternative probes of density and velocity
fluctuations in the host-galaxy ISM. We then apply this formalism to three FRBs
with detailed host-galaxy analyses in the literature, with the primary
motivation of determining whether FRB scattering within the host galaxy probes
the same turbulent cascade as the gas seen in H${\rm \alpha}$ emission. In all
cases we consider, we find such an association plausible, although in one of
these sources, FRB 20121102A, the radio-scattering limit on the turbulent
energy is much less constraining than the H${\rm \alpha}$ line width. We
anticipate that future FRB surveys, especially those at frequencies below 1
GHz, will find many FRBs that illuminate the small-scale properties of
extragalactic ISM.

the randomness and excess instructions executed by these solutions, they

  In this work we propose a scheduling algorithm that dynamically reorders
instructions in an out-of-order processor to provide obfuscated execution and
mitigate power analysis attacks with little-to-no effect on the performance,

availability of critical instructions (slack) to create high-performance random

Further, we perform an extended security analysis using different attacks. We
highlight the dangers of using incorrect adversarial assumptions, which can
often lead to a false sense of security. In that regard, our advanced security
metric demonstrates improvements of 34$\times$, while our basic security
evaluation shows results up to 261$\times$. Moreover, our system achieves

solvable reference systems that contain the essential physics of the system.
For the $t-t'-U$ Hubbard model, the four-site plaquette is known to have a
quantum critical point in the $U-\mu$ space where states with electron
occupations $N=2, 3, 4$ per plaquette are degenerate [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 94},

of the essential elements of the cuprate superconductivity. For this purpose we
design an efficient superperturbation theory -- based on the dual fermion
approach -- with the critical plaquette as the reference system. Thus, the
perturbation theory already contains the relevant d-wave fluctuations from the
beginning via the two-particle correlations of the plaquette. We find that
d-wave superconductivity remains a leading instability channel under reasonably
broad range of parameters. The next-nearest-neighbour hopping $t'$ is shown to
play a crucial role in a formation of strongly bound electronic bipolarons
whose coherence at lower temperature results in superconductivity. The physics
of the pseudogap within the developed picture is also discussed.

by fully decentralizing the classic zero-forcing receiver across multiple
processing nodes based on the gradient descent method. In this paper, we first
explicitly relate this decentralized receiver to a distributed version of the
Kaczmarz algorithm and to the use of the successive interference cancellation
(SIC) philosophy to mitigate the residual across nodes. In addition, we propose
two methods to further accelerate the initial convergence of these iterative
decentralized receivers by exploring the connection with the Kaczmarz
algorithm: 1) a new Bayesian distributed receiver, which can eliminate noise on
an iteration basis; 2) a more practical method for choosing the relaxation
parameter. The discussion also consider spatial non-stationarities that arise
when the antenna arrays are extremely large (XL-MIMO). We were able to improve
the numerical results for both spatially stationary and non-stationary
channels, but mainly the non-stationary performance can still be improved
compared to the centralized ZF receiver. Future research directions are
provided with the aim of further improving the applicability of the receiver
based on the principle of successive residual cancellation (SRC).

transition within a narrow range of Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter. Reentrant

2) the insufficient expressiveness of the maximum-likelihood translation. To

strength to induce a transition from volume to area-law scaling of the
steady-state entanglement entropy. While static background disorder
systematically reduces the critical measurement strength, this critical value
depends non-monotonically on the strength of non-static noise. According to the
extracted fine-size scaling exponents, the universality class of the transition
is independent of the noise and disorder strength. We interpret the results in
terms of the effect of static and non-static disorder on the intricate dynamics
of the entanglement generation rate due to the Hamiltonian in the absence of
measurement, which is fully reflected in the behavior of the critical
measurement strength. Our results establish a firm connection between this

Dystrophy (SFD) and to investigate the relationship of choriocapillaris flow
with the choroidal and outer retinal microstructure. Methods: In this
prospective case-control study, 18 eyes of 11 patients with early SFD and 32
eyes of 32 controls without ocular pathology underwent multimodal imaging
including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT)followed by
deep-learning-based layer segmentation. OCT-angiography (OCT-A) was performed
to quantify choriocapillaris flow signal deficits (FDs). Differences in
choriocapillaris flow area percentage between SFD patients and controls were
determined and a structure-function correlation with outer retinal layer
thicknesses were analyzed based on mixed model analysis. Results: SFD patients
exhibited a significantly greater choriocapillaris FDs area percentage than
controls (estimate [95% CI] 32.05% [24.31-39.80] vs. 23.36% [20.64-26.09],
P<0.001), even when adjusting for age. Choroidal thickness was a structural OCT
surrogate of the choriocapillaris FD area percentage (-0.82% per 100
micrometer, P=0.017), whereas retinal-pigment-epithelium-drusen-complex
thickness was not informative regarding choriocapillaris FDs (P=0.932). The
choriocapillaris FD area percentage was associated with an altered
microstructure of the overlying photoreceptors (outer-segments, inner-segments
and outer-nuclear-layer thinning of -0.31, -0.12 and -0.47 $\mu$m per %FD,
respectively, P<0.001). Conclusions: Patients with early SFD exhibit pronounced
abnormalities of choriocapillaris flow signal on OCT-A, which are not limited
to areas of sub-RPE deposits seen in OCT imaging. Thus, analysis of the
choriocapillaris flow may enable clinical trials at earlier disease stages in
SFD and possibly in mimicking diseases with an impaired Bruchs membrane
including age-related macular degeneration.

recently developed Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX), an
iterative immunolabeling and chemical bleaching method that enables multiplexed
imaging (>65 parameters) in diverse tissues, including human organs relevant
for international consortia efforts. IBEX is compatible with over 250
commercially available antibodies, 16 unique fluorophores, and can be easily
adopted to different imaging platforms using slides and non-proprietary imaging
chambers. The overall protocol consists of iterative cycles of antibody
labelling, imaging, and chemical bleaching that can be completed at relatively
low cost in 2-5 days by biologists with basic laboratory skills. To support
widespread adoption, we provide extensive details on tissue processing, curated
lists of validated antibodies, and tissue-specific panels for multiplex

using competitively priced instruments and reagents. Finally, we present a
software solution for image alignment that can be executed by individuals
without programming experience using open source software and freeware. In
summary, IBEX is an open and versatile method that can be readily implemented
by academic laboratories and scaled to achieve high content mapping of diverse

accurately participants could report the ratio between two depicted values.
There is an assumption that this ranking should hold for different tasks and
for different numbers of marks. However, there is little existing work testing
assumption, especially given that visually computing ratios is relatively
unimportant in real-world visualizations, compared to seeing, remembering, and
comparing trends and motifs, across displays that almost universally depict
more than two values.
  We asked participants to immediately reproduce a set of values from memory.
With a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, we observed how the relevant rank
positions of visual channels shift across different numbers of marks (2, 4 or
8) and for bias, precision, and error measures. The ranking did not hold, even
for reproductions of only 2 marks, and the new ranking was highly inconsistent
for reproductions of different numbers of marks. Other factors besides channel
choice far more influence on performance, such as the number of values in the
series (e.g. more marks led to larger errors), or the value of each mark (e.g.
small values are systematically overestimated).
  Recall was worse for displays with 8 marks than 4, consistent with
established limits on visual memory. These results show that we must move
beyond two-value ratio judgments as a baseline for ranking the quality of a
visual channel, including testing new tasks (detection of trends or motifs),
timescales (immediate computation, or later comparison), and the number of

key missing ingredient is to determine the relations between growth kinetics,
structure, and transport parameters. Here, we address these relations by
studying solute diffusion through three-dimensional porous films produced by
simple deposition models with controlled thickness and porosity. We simulate
growing films with competitive aggregation rules that incorporate lateral
aggregation (relative rate proportional to $p$), which leads to pore formation,
and surface relaxation ($1-p$) that favors compaction. By connecting a solute
source at the basis and a drain at the top outer surface of the films, we
extract the effective diffusion coefficients from steady-state simulations. We
find that for a given film thickness, the larger the $p$, the larger the
effective porosity and diffusivity, but the smaller the tortuosity. Keeping
constant growth conditions (i.e., same $p$), the increase of thickness always
leads to an increase of effective porosity, but a nontrivial behavior in the
diffusivity occurs: for $p\leq 0.7$, the diffusion coefficient is larger in
thicker films; this is accompanied by a decrease of the tortuosity with the
thickness, thus indicating that growth continuously improves pore structure for
diffusion. Microscopically, such a result is associated with narrower
distributions of local solute currents at higher points of films. Particularly
for $p\geq 0.9$, in which film porosity is $\sim 0.65-0.7$, the tortuosity is
between $1.3$ and $2$, increases with the thickness, and has maximal changes
near $25\%$. Pairs of values of porosity and tortuosity that we obtain here,
for the thickest films, agree with those experimentally measured in some porous
electrodes. Noteworthy, the increase of film thickness is generally favorable
for diffusion in their pores, and exceptions have small losses in tortuosity.

discrete (rather than continuous) symmetry of the 2D Ising model of the
spin-spin interaction mediated by the spin-orbit coupling of 2D free carriers,
which precludes the validity of the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Further, the
analysis clearly illustrates the crucial role of the molecular field
fluctuations as opposed to the mean field. The developed theoretical model
describes the desired magnetization and phase-transition temperature $T_c$ in
terms of a single parameter; namely, the chemical potential $\mu$. Our results
highlight a path way to reach the highest possible $T_c$ in a given material as
well as an opportunity to control the magnetic properties externally (e.g., via
a gate bias). Numerical estimations show that magnetic impurities such as

database research community in recent years. Despite their current limitations,
recent proposals of distributed deterministic transaction processing systems
demonstrated significant improvements over systems using traditional
transaction processing techniques (e.g., two-phase-locking or optimistic
concurrency control with two-phase-commit). However, the problem of ensuring
high availability in deterministic distributed transaction processing systems
has received less attention from the research community, and this aspect has
not been analyzed and evaluated well. This paper proposes a generic framework
to model the replication process in deterministic transaction processing
systems and use it to study three cases. We design and implement QR-Store, a
queue-oriented replicated transaction processing system, and extensively
evaluate it with various workloads based on a transactional version of YCSB.
Our prototype implementation QR-Store can achieve a throughput of 1.9 million
replicated transactions per second in under 200 milliseconds and a replication
overhead of 8%-25% compared to non-replicated configurations.

in the stationary scenario is diffusive for most of the parameter space, a
flaring scenario is always accompanied by a non-diffusive phase in the

such as $\gamma$ Cephei (with semimajor axis around 20 AU) is theoretically
challenging because of destructive high-velocity collisions between
planetesimals. Despite this fragmentation barrier, planets are known to exist
in such orbital configurations. Here we present a novel numerical framework for
carrying out multi-annulus coagulation-fragmentation calculations of
planetesimal growth, which fully accounts for the specifics of planetesimal
dynamics in binaries, details of planetesimal collision outcomes, and the
radial transport of solids in the disk due to the gas drag-driven inspiral. Our
dynamical inputs properly incorporate the gravitational effects of both the
eccentric stellar companion and the massive non-axisymmetric protoplanetary
disk in which planetesimals reside, as well as gas drag. We identify a set of
disk parameters that lead to successful planetesimal growth in systems such as
$\gamma$ Cephei or $\alpha$ Centauri starting from $1-10$ km size objects. We
identify the apsidal alignment of a protoplanetary disk with the binary orbit
as one of the critical conditions for successful planetesimal growth: It
naturally leads to the emergence of a dynamically quiet location in the disk
(as long as the disk eccentricity is of order several percent), where favorable
conditions for planetesimal growth exist. Accounting for the gravitational
effect of a protoplanetary disk plays a key role in arriving at this
conclusion, in agreement with our previous results. These findings lend support
to the streaming instability as the mechanism of planetesimal formation. They
provide important insights for theories of planet formation around both binary
and single stars, as well as for the hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary
disks in binaries (for which we identify a set of key diagnostics to verify).

several dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) strongly suggest a link between AGN
and SMBHBs, given that these dual AGN systems will eventually form bound binary
pairs. Here we develop an exploratory SMBHB population model based on
empirically constrained quasar populations, allowing us to decompose the GWB
amplitude into an underlying distribution of SMBH masses, SMBHB number density,
and volume enclosing the GWB. Our approach also allows us to self-consistently
predict the number of local SMBHB systems from the GWB amplitude.
Interestingly, we find the local number density of SMBHBs implied by the
common-process signal in the NANOGrav 12.5-yr dataset to be roughly five times
larger than previously predicted by other models. We also find that at most
$\sim 25 \%$ of SMBHBs can be associated with quasars. Furthermore, our
quasar-based approach predicts $\gtrsim 95\%$ of the GWB signal comes from $z
\lesssim 2.5$, and that SMBHBs contributing to the GWB have masses $\gtrsim
10^8 M_\odot$. We also explore how different empirical galaxy-black hole
scaling relations affect the local number density of GW sources, and find that
relations predicting more massive black holes decrease the local number density
of SMBHBs. Overall, our results point to the important role that a measurement

relationship between the two, such as sulfidization of metal. Enrichments in

these elements. The observed depletions in Ge suggest that it may have been
lost by evaporation or else was never incorporated into the metal or sulfide

evaporation, but, being partially lithophile, may also have been preferentially
incorporated into silicates during chondrule formation. Trace element

origin of the SRM grains.

new guarantees on the quality of estimators resulting from adaptive windowing
techniques, which are of independent interest in the data mining community.
Furthermore, we conduct a finite-time analysis of ADR-bandit in two typical
environments: an abrupt environment where changes occur instantaneously and a
gradual environment where changes occur progressively. We demonstrate that
ADR-bandit has nearly optimal performance when the abrupt or global changes
occur in a coordinated manner that we call global changes. We demonstrate that
forced exploration is unnecessary when we restrict the interest to the global
changes. Unlike the existing nonstationary bandit algorithms, ADR-bandit has
optimal performance in stationary environments as well as nonstationary
environments with global changes. Our experiments show that the proposed
algorithms outperform the existing approaches in synthetic and real-world
environments.

development due to their asynchronous interaction with the environment. In this
setting model based testing has been employed when checking conformance and
generating test suites of such systems using labeled transition system as a
formalism as well as the classical ioco conformance relation. In this work we
turn to a more complex scenario where the target systems have an auxiliary
memory, a stack. We then studied a more powerful model, the Visibly Pushdown
Labeled Transition System (VPTS), its variant Input/Output VPTS (IOVPTS), its
associated model Visibly Pushdown Automaton (VPA), and aspects of conformance
testing and test suite generation. This scenario is much more challenge since
the base model has a pushdown stack to capture more complex behaviors which
commonly found on reactive systems. We then defined a more general conformance
relation for pushdown reactive systems such that it prevents any observable
implementation behavior that was not already present in the given
specification. Further we gave an efficient algorithm to check conformance in
this testing scenario and also showed that it runs in worst case asymptotic
polynomial time in the size of both the given specification and the
implementation that are put under test.

molecular species at small spatial scales towards massive young stellar
objects. Thus, we present a high-angular resolution CN study towards a sample
of massive protostars, with the aim of unveiling the spatial distribution at
the small scale of the emission of this radical in relation to the star-forming
processes. The interstellar CN has a strong emission line at the rest frequency
226874.764 MHz, thus, we search for observing projects in the ALMA database
regarding high-mass star-forming regions observed at Band 6. A sample of ten
high-mass star-forming regions were selected in base on that they present a
clear emission of CN at the mentioned frequency. We found that the CN traces
both molecular condensations and diffuse and extended gas surrounding them. In
general, the molecular condensations traced by the maximums of the CN emission
do not spatially coincide with the peaks of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm,
which trace the molecular cores where the massive stars born. Based on the
presence or lack of near-IR emission associated with such cores, we suggest
that our sample is composed by sources at different stages of evolution. The CN
is present at both, suggesting that this radical may be ubiquitous along the
different star formation stages, and hence it may be involved in different

alternative solution that decreases the dependency on traditional fuels such as

employing dynamic wireless power transfer systems (DWPT) without increasing
their battery size or having stopovers. Additionally, developing a decision
system that avoids an excessive load on the power grid is essential. These

tissue, while also accounting for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), which
allows phantom studies to be performed at a population scale. At the same time,
the XCAT phantom does not currently include the lymphatic system, critical for
evaluating bulky nodal malignancies in lymphoma. We aimed to incorporate a full
lymphatic system into the XCAT phantom and to generate realistic simulated
images via guidance from lymphoma patient studies.
  Methods: A template lymphatic system was extended based on known anatomy was
used to define 276 lymph nodes and corresponding vessels using non-uniform
rational basis spline (NURBS) surfaces. Lymph node properties were modified
using the Rhinoceros 3D viewing software. The XCAT general parameter script was
used to input organ concentrations and generate binary files with uptake and
attenuation information.
  Results: Lymph nodes can be scaled, stretched, and translated within the
intuitive Rhinoceros interface, to allow for realistic simulation of different
lymph node pathologies. Bulky, heterogeneous PMBCL tumours were generated in
the mediastinum using expanded lymph nodes. Our results suggest that optimized
thresholding provides better accuracy for determining total metabolic tumour
volume (TMTV) of PMBCL tumours, while the gradient method was most accurate for
total lesion glycolysis (TLG).
  Conclusions: An upgraded XCAT phantom with a fully simulated lymphatic system
was created. Distributed to the research community, the XCAT phantom with the
new lymphatic system has the potential of enabling studies to optimize image
quality and quantitation, towards improved assessment of lymphoma including
predictive modeling (e.g. improved TMTV and radiomics research).

in which many of the fully defined principal submatrices are PSD is
approximately PSD completable. These questions are related to graph theory
because we can think of the entries of a symmetric matrix as corresponding to
the edges of a graph.
  We first introduce a family of graphs, which we call thickened graphs; these
contain both triangle-free and chordal graphs, and can be viewed as the result
of replacing the edges of a graph by an arbitrary chordal graph. We believe
these graphs might be of independent interest.
  We then show that for a class of graphs including thickened graphs, it is
possible to get quantitative bounds on how well the property of having these
principal submatrices being PSD approximates the PSD-completability property.
These bounds frequently only depend on the size of the smallest cycle of size
at least 4 in the graph. We introduce some tools that allow us to better
control the quality of these approximations and indicate how these
approximations can be used to improve the performance of semidefinite programs.

continuous-time homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDS) via tensor
algebra. In particular, if a system of homogeneous polynomial differential
equations can be represented by an orthogonally decomposable (odeco) tensor, we
can construct its explicit solution by exploiting tensor Z-eigenvalues and
Z-eigenvectors. We refer to such HPDS as odeco HPDS. By utilizing the form of
the explicit solution, we are able to discuss the stability properties of an
odeco HPDS. We illustrate that the Z-eigenvalues of the corresponding dynamic
tensor can be used to establish necessary and sufficient stability conditions,
similar to these from linear systems theory. In addition, we are able to obtain
the complete solution to an odeco HPDS with constant control. Finally, we
establish results which enable one to determine if a general HPDS can be
transformed to or approximated by an odeco HPDS, where the previous results can
be applied. We demonstrate our framework with simulated and real-world
examples.

persistent, partial connectivity, and islands when one or more computers are
partitioned from the main Internet. We provide algorithms to measure,
operationally, the number, size, and duration of peninsulas and islands. We
apply these algorithms in rigorous measurement from two complementary
measurement systems, one observing 5M networks from a few locations, and the
other a few destinations from 10k locations. Results show that peninsulas
(partial connectivity) are about as common as Internet outages, quantifying
this long-observed problem. Root causes show that most peninsula events (45%)
are routing transients, but most peninsula-time (90%) is from a few long-lived

root, separating measurement error and persistent problems from underlying
differences and operationally important transients. Finally, our definition
confirms the international nature of the Internet: no single country can

its practical values in automatically localising the most salient visual
segments corresponding to their language descriptions (sentences) from
untrimmed and unstructured videos. For supervised model training, a temporal
annotation of both the start and end time index of each video segment for a
sentence (a video moment) must be given. This is not only very expensive but
also sensitive to ambiguity and subjective annotation bias, a much harder task
than image labelling. In this work, we develop a more accurate
weakly-supervised solution by introducing Cross-Sentence Relations Mining (CRM)
in video moment proposal generation and matching when only a paragraph
description of activities without per-sentence temporal annotation is
available. Specifically, we explore two cross-sentence relational constraints:
(1) Temporal ordering and (2) semantic consistency among sentences in a
paragraph description of video activities. Existing weakly-supervised
techniques only consider within-sentence video segment correlations in training
without considering cross-sentence paragraph context. This can mislead due to
ambiguous expressions of individual sentences with visually indiscriminate
video moment proposals in isolation. Experiments on two publicly available
activity localisation datasets show the advantages of our approach over the
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods, especially so when the video

encode various interesting examples of classifier safety specifications from

present a run-time mechanism for the enforcement of safe-ordering constraints.
Our approach is based on a self-correcting layer, which provably yields safe

this layer with an existing neural network classifier to construct a
self-correcting network (SC-Net), and show that in addition to providing safe
outputs, the SC-Net is guaranteed to preserve the classification accuracy of
the original network whenever possible. Our approach is independent of the size

on the specified property and the dimension of the network's output; thus it is
scalable to large state-of-the-art networks. We show that our approach can be

for developing theory inductively e iteratively from qualitative data based on
theoretical sampling, coding, constant comparison, memoing, and saturation, as
main characteristics. Large or controversial GT studies may involve multiple
researchers in collaborative coding, which requires a kind of rigor and
consensus that an individual coder does not. Although many qualitative
researchers reject quantitative measures in favor of other qualitative
criteria, many others are committed to measuring consensus through Inter-Rater
Reliability (IRR) and/or Inter-Rater Agreement (IRA) techniques to develop a
shared understanding of the phenomenon being studied. However, there are no
specific guidelines about how and when to apply IRR/IRA during the iterative
process of GT, so researchers have been using ad hoc methods for years. This
paper presents a process for systematically applying IRR/IRA in GT studies that
meets the iterative nature of this qualitative research method, which is
supported by a previous systematic literature review on applying IRR/RA in GT
studies in software engineering. This process allows researchers to
incrementally generate a theory while ensuring consensus on the constructs that
support it and, thus, improving the rigor of qualitative research. This
formalization helps researchers to apply IRR/IRA to GT studies when various
raters are involved in coding. Measuring consensus among raters promotes
communicability, transparency, reflexivity, replicability, and trustworthiness

the Page-Wootters mechanism has attracted much attention in the last few years.
Originally, such a mechanism explored a stationary bipartite non-interacting

determine how the evolution in time can emerge as an equation of motion for a
quantum particle conditioned to the measurement of the state of the clock.
After the seminal proposal, many variations of it were considered, and
different aspects of the mechanism were elucidated. Our contribution to these

but deriving an equation of motion for a mixed state system that evolves
according to its gravitationally induced interaction with a non-ideal quantum

the number and positions of the change points, as well as the regime structure
in the clusters induced by those changes. The product partition model (PPM) is
a widely used approach for the detection of multiple change points. The
traditional PPM assumes that change points split the set of time points in
random clusters that define a partition of the time axis. It is then typically
assumed that sampling model parameter values within each of these blocks are
identical. Because changes in different parameters of the observational model
may occur at different times, the PPM thus fails to identify the parameters
that experienced those changes. A similar problem may occur when detecting
changes in multivariate time series. To solve this important limitation, we
introduce a multipartition model to detect multiple change points occurring in
several parameters at possibly different times. The proposed model assumes that
the changes experienced by each parameter generate a different random partition
of the time axis, which facilitates identifying which parameters have changed
and when they do so. We discuss a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler scheme to
implement posterior simulation under the proposed model. We apply the proposed
model to identify multiple change points in Normal means and variances and
evaluate the performance of the proposed model through Monte Carlo simulations
and data illustrations. Its performance is compared with some previously
proposed approaches for change point problems. These studies show that the
proposed model is competitive and enriches the analysis of change point
problems.

the estimator is efficient and characterize its asymptotic distribution. A
method to construct simultaneous 95% confidence bands for the

problem relevant to many engineering applications (e.g., the process of

model of natural convection in porous media employing deep convolutional
autoencoders for the compression and reconstruction and either radial basis
function (RBF) interpolation or artificial neural networks (ANNs) for mapping
parameters of partial differential equations (PDEs) on the corresponding
nonlinear manifolds. To benchmark our approach, we also describe linear
compression and reconstruction processes relying on proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) and ANNs. We present comprehensive comparisons among
different models through three benchmark problems. The reduced order models,
linear and nonlinear approaches, are much faster than the finite element model,
obtaining a maximum speed-up of $7 \times 10^{6}$ because our framework is not
bound by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition; hence, it could deliver
quantities of interest at any given time contrary to the finite element model.
Our model's accuracy still lies within a mean squared error of 0.07 (two-order
of magnitude lower than the maximum value of the finite element results) in the
worst-case scenario. We illustrate that, in specific settings, the nonlinear
approach outperforms its linear counterpart and vice versa. We hypothesize that
a visual comparison between principal component analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) could indicate which method will perform
better prior to employing any specific compression strategy.

for high-dimensional random landscapes and studied from the perspective of

author, the continuous random energy model (CREM) was proposed as a simple toy
model to study the efficiency of such algorithms. The following question was
raised in that paper: what is the threshold $\beta_G$, at which sampling
(approximately) from the Gibbs measure at inverse temperature $\beta$ becomes
algorithmically hard?
  This paper is a first step towards answering this question. We consider the
branching random walk, a time-homogeneous version of the continuous random
energy model. We show that a simple greedy search on a renormalized tree yields
a linear-time algorithm which approximately samples from the Gibbs measure, for
every $\beta < \beta_c$, the (static) critical point. More precisely, we show
that for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists such an algorithm such that the
specific relative entropy between the law sampled by the algorithm and the
Gibbs measure of inverse temperature $\beta$ is less than $\varepsilon$ with
high probability.
  In the supercritical regime $\beta > \beta_c$, we provide the following
hardness result. Under a mild regularity condition, for every $\delta > 0$,
there exists $z>0$ such that the running time of any given algorithm
approximating the Gibbs measure stochastically dominates a geometric random
variable with parameter $e^{-z\sqrt{N}}$ on an event with probability at least
$1-\delta$.

partially reflected by multiple objects along its path, resulting in multiple

about object contours and semi-transparent surfaces which can be used to better
identify and locate objects. LiDAR can also measure surface reflectance
(intensity of laser pulse return), as well as ambient light of the scene
(sunlight reflected by objects). These signals are already available in
commercial LiDAR devices but have not been used in most LiDAR-based detection

quantum technologies. In the optical domain, the most common type of quantum
entanglement is polarization entanglement, which is usually created in a
postselection manner involving destructive photon detection and thus hindering
further applications which require readily available entanglement resources. In
this work, we propose a scheme to prepare multipartite entangled states of
polarized photons in a heralded manner, i.e., without postselection. We exploit
the quantum scissors technique to truncate a given continuous-variable
entanglement into the target entangled states which are of hybrid
discrete-continuous or solely discrete types. We consider two implementations
of the quantum scissors: one modified from the original quantum scissors [Pegg
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1604 (1998)] using single photons and linear
optics and the other designed here using a type-II two-mode squeezer. We
clarify the pros and cons of these two implementations as well as discussing
practical aspects of the entanglement preparation. Our work illustrates an
interface between various types of optical entanglement and the proposed
quantum scissors techniques could serve as alternative methods for heralded
generation of polarization entanglement.

Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNNs) exploit such representational power by
lifting Euclidean features into hyperbolic space for classification,
outperforming Euclidean neural networks (ENNs) on datasets with known semantic
hierarchies. However, HNNs underperform ENNs on standard benchmarks without
clear hierarchies, greatly restricting HNNs' applicability in practice.
  Our key insight is that HNNs' poorer general classification performance
results from vanishing gradients during backpropagation, caused by their hybrid
architecture connecting Euclidean features to a hyperbolic classifier. We
propose an effective solution by simply clipping the Euclidean feature
magnitude while training HNNs.
  Our experiments demonstrate that clipped HNNs become super-hyperbolic
classifiers: They are not only consistently better than HNNs which already
outperform ENNs on hierarchical data, but also on-par with ENNs on MNIST,
CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, with better adversarial robustness

modest telescope and a coronagraph must reach the SGLs focal region, that
begins at $\sim$550 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun and is oriented
outward along the line connecting the distant object and the Sun. No spacecraft
has ever reached even a half of that distance; and to do so within a reasonable
mission lifetime (e.g., less than 25 years) and affordable cost requires a new
type of mission design, using solar sails and microsats ($<100$~kg). The payoff

the geometry of the constituent self-repeating unit cells, to potentially damp
out vibration in selected frequency ranges, thus yielding desired bandgaps.
However, it remains challenging to quickly arrive at unit cell designs that
satisfy any requested bandgap specifications within a given global frequency
range. This paper develops a computationally efficient framework for (fast)
inverse design of LREM, by integrating a new type of machine learning models
called invertible neural networks or INN. An INN can be trained to predict the
bandgap bounds as a function of the unit cell design, and interestingly at the
same time it learns to predict the unit cell design given a bandgap, when
executed in reverse. In our case the unit cells are represented in terms of the
width's of the outer matrix and middle soft filler layer of the unit cell.
Training data on the frequency response of the unit cell is provided by Bloch
dispersion analyses. The trained INN is used to instantaneously retrieve
feasible (or near feasible) inverse designs given a specified bandgap
constraint, which is then used to initialize a forward constrained optimization
(based on sequential quadratic programming) to find the bandgap satisfying unit
cell with minimum mass. Case studies show favorable performance of this
approach, in terms of the bandgap characteristics and minimized mass, when
compared to the median scenario over ten randomly initialized optimizations for
the same specified bandgaps. Further analysis using FEA verify the bandgap
performance of a finite structure comprised of $8\times 8$ arrangement of the
unit cells obtained with INN-accelerated inverse design.

subject to non-stationary and unknown excitation, which are common and critical
problems in design and health management of mechanical systems.
  A primary-auxiliary model scheduling procedure based on time-domain
transmissibilities is proposed and performed under switching linear dynamics:
In addition to constructing a primary transmissibility family from the
pseudo-inputs to the output during the offline stage, an auxiliary
transmissibility family is constructed by further decomposing the pseudo-input
vector into two parts. The auxiliary family enables to determine the unknown
working condition at which the system is currently running at, and then an
appropriate transmissibility from the primary transmissibility family for
estimating the unknown output can be selected during the online estimation
stage. As a result, the proposed approach offers a generalizable and
explainable solution to the signal estimation problems in nonlinear mechanical
systems in the context of switching linear dynamics with unknown inputs.
  A real-world application to the estimation of the vertical wheel force in a
full vehicle system are, respectively, conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. During the vehicle design phase, the
vertical wheel force is the most important one among Wheel Center Loads (WCLs),
and it is often measured directly with expensive, intrusive, and
hard-to-install measurement devices during full vehicle testing campaigns.
Meanwhile, the estimation problem of the vertical wheel force has not been
solved well and is still of great interest. The experimental results show good

stochastic optimization. On smooth nonconvex problems, a few acceleration
techniques have been applied to improve the convergence rate of SGMs. However,
little exploration has been made on applying a certain acceleration technique
to a stochastic subgradient method (SsGM) for nonsmooth nonconvex problems. In
addition, few efforts have been made to analyze an (accelerated) SsGM with
delayed derivatives. The information delay naturally happens in a distributed
system, where computing workers do not coordinate with each other.
  In this paper, we propose an inertial proximal SsGM for solving nonsmooth
nonconvex stochastic optimization problems. The proposed method can have
guaranteed convergence even with delayed derivative information in a
distributed environment. Convergence rate results are established to three
classes of nonconvex problems: weakly-convex nonsmooth problems with a convex
regularizer, composite nonconvex problems with a nonsmooth convex regularizer,
and smooth nonconvex problems. For each problem class, the convergence rate is
$O(1/K^{\frac{1}{2}})$ in the expected value of the gradient norm square, for
$K$ iterations. In a distributed environment, the convergence rate of the
proposed method will be slowed down by the information delay. Nevertheless, the
slow-down effect will decay with the number of iterations for the latter two
problem classes. We test the proposed method on three applications. The
numerical results clearly demonstrate the advantages of using the
inertial-based acceleration. Furthermore, we observe higher parallelization
speed-up in asynchronous updates over the synchronous counterpart, though the
former uses delayed derivatives. Our source code is released at

offers non-volatility and zero leakage power, while providing higher cell
densities, longer data retention time, and higher capacity scaling compared to
DRAM. In PCM, data is stored in the crystalline or amorphous state of the phase
change material. The typical electrically-controlled PCM (EPCM), however,
suffers from longer write latency and higher write energy compared to DRAM and
limited multi-level cell (MLC) capacities. These challenges limit the
performance of data-intensive applications running on computing systems with
EPCMs.
  Recently, researchers demonstrated optically-controlled PCM (OPCM) cells,
with support for 5 bits/cell in contrast to 2 bits/cell in EPCM. These OPCM
cells can be accessed directly with optical signals that are multiplexed in
high-bandwidth-density silicon-photonic links. The higher MLC capacity in OPCM
and the direct cell access using optical signals enable an increased read/write
throughput and lower energy per access than EPCM. However, due to the direct
cell access using optical signals, OPCM systems cannot be designed using
conventional memory architecture. We need a complete redesign of the memory
architecture that is tailored to the properties of OPCM technology.
  This paper presents the design of a unified network and main memory system
called COSMOS that combines OPCM and silicon-photonic links to achieve high
memory throughput. COSMOS is composed of a hierarchical multi-banked OPCM array
with novel read and write access protocols, and uses an
Electrical-Optical-Electrical (E-O-E) control unit to interface with the
processor. Our evaluation of a 2.5D-integrated system containing a processor
and COSMOS demonstrates 2.14x average speedup compared to an EPCM system.
COSMOS consumes 3.8x lower read energy-per-bit and 5.97x lower write
energy-per-bit compared to EPCM.

still unsatisfactory. To further cope with these challenges, we present a novel
double-branch encoder architecture. Our architecture is inspired by two
observations: 1) Since the discrimination of features learned via square
convolutional kernels needs to be further improved, we propose to utilize
non-square vertical and horizontal convolutional kernels in the double-branch
encoder, so features learned by the two branches can be expected to complement
each other. 2) Considering that spatial attention can help models to better
focus on the target region in a large-sized image, we develop an attention loss
to further emphasize the segmentation on small-sized targets. Together, the
above two schemes give rise to a novel double-branch encoder segmentation
framework for medical image segmentation, namely Crosslink-Net. The experiments
validate the effectiveness of our model on four datasets. The code is released

cloth-irrelevant cues. This paper proposes a semantic-guided pixel sampling
approach for the cloth-changing person re-ID task. We do not explicitly define
which feature to extract but force the model to automatically learn
cloth-irrelevant cues. Specifically, we first recognize the pedestrian's upper
clothes and pants, then randomly change them by sampling pixels from other
pedestrians. The changed samples retain the identity labels but exchange the
pixels of clothes or pants among different pedestrians. Besides, we adopt a
loss function to constrain the learned features to keep consistent before and
after changes. In this way, the model is forced to learn cues that are
irrelevant to upper clothes and pants. We conduct extensive experiments on the
latest released PRCC dataset. Our method achieved 65.8% on Rank1 accuracy,

have a helical nature. Depending on the reheating mechanism, we consider two
different cases - (1) instantaneous reheating scenario, in which case the
reheating e-fold number is zero, and (2) Kamionkowski reheating scenario which
is parametrized by a non-zero e-fold number, a reheating equation of state
parameter and a given reheating temperature. It is demonstrated that for both
the reheating mechanisms, the generated magnetic fields can be compatible with
the observations for suitable range of the model parameter present in the
non-minimal coupling of the electromagnetic field. Actually the present
magnetogenesis model does not produce sufficient hierarchy between the electric
and magnetic fields at the end of inflation, and thus the electric field is not
able to sufficiently induce (or enhance) the magnetic field during the
Kamionkowski reheating stage. This in turn makes both the reheating cases
almost similar from the perspective of magnetic field's evolution. Furthermore
we find that the magnetic fields at the galactic scale with strength $\sim

in D- and E- layers under average undisturbed conditions. This is important for
the retrieval of long term variations in the electron density in the lower
ionosphere. The model also makes it feasible to interpret vertical absorption
in experimental data, thereby significantly expanding the capability of HF

sign of Sxx suggesting charge transport due to electrons. Magnetic field
dependence of the Nernst thermopower (Sxy) at a fixed temperature shows a rapid
increase at low fields and a tendency to saturate at high fields as like the
magnetization. Anomalous contribution to Sxy was extracted from total Sxy
measured and it exhibits a maximum value of ~ 0.21 microV/K at 180 K for H = 50
kOe, which is comparable to the value found in a single crystal for a lower Sr

expands along the direction of the magnetic field and it does not saturate even
at 50 kOe. The magnetostriction increases with decreasing temperature below TC

Second, we propose a robust partial correlation-based screening approach when

exposure on both response and each covariate, we use a nonparametric regression
with some specified loss function. More specifically, a robust
correlation-based screening method (RC-SIS) and a robust partial

screening properties of RC-SIS for which the response variable can be either
continuous or discrete, as well as those of RPC-SIS(L2) and RPC-SIS(L1) under
some regularity conditions. Our approaches are essentially nonparametric, and
perform robustly for both the response and the covariates. Finally, extensive

the bonding between its carbonyl oxygen (OC) and surface Zn. Secondly,
subsequent decomposition reactions show large tendency of EC to decompose on
both pristine and defective ZnO (10-10). This tendency is indicated by the
large thermodynamic driving forces to decompose EC that range from -1.5 eV to
-2.5 eV on both pristine and defective ZnO (10-10) (calculated with respect to
EC gas phase). The large tendency of EC to decompose, however, is hindered by
the high activation barriers of the EC decomposition, shown by the lowest
activation barrier of 0.96 eV on Zn vacancy defected ZnO (10-10). Our results
thus indicate that EC decomposition on ZnO (10-10) is mainly hindered due to
its slow rate of decomposition instead of the thermodynamic factors.

heterogeneous in space and time and diffuse anomalously due to a combination of
viscoelasticity, caging, aggregation and active transport. Some of the
trajectories display switching between persistent and anti-persistent motion
while others jiggle around in one position for the whole measurement time. By
splitting the ensemble of endosome trajectories into slow moving sub-diffusive
and fast moving super-diffusive endosomes, we analyzed them separately. The
mean squared displacements and velocity auto-correlation functions confirm the
effectiveness of the splitting methods. Applying the local analysis, we show
that both ensembles are characterized by a spectrum of local anomalous
exponents and local generalized diffusion coefficients. Slow and fast endsomes
have exponential distributions of local anomalous exponents and power law
distributions of generalized diffusion coefficients. This suggests that
heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion is an appropriate model for both fast

Recently, the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST)
detected the largest burst sample of FRB 121102, containing 1652 bursts. We use
this sample to investigate the energy and waiting time distributions. The
energy count distribution $dN/dE$ at the high-energy range ($>10^{38}$ erg) can
be fitted with a single power-law function with an index of $-1.86
^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, while the distribution at the low-energy range deviates from
the power-law function. An interesting result of Li et al. (2021) is that there
is an apparent temporal gap between early bursts (occurring before MJD 58740)
and late bursts (occurring after MJD 58740). We find the energy distributions
of high-energy bursts at different epochs are inconsistent. The power-law index
is $-1.70^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ for early bursts and $-2.60^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$ for
late bursts. For bursts observed in a single day, a linear repetition pattern
is found. We use the Weibull function to fit the distribution of waiting time
of consecutive bursts. The shape parameter $k = 0.72^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and the
event rate $r = 736.43^{+26.55}_{-28.90}$ day$ ^{-1} $ are derived. If the
waiting times with $\delta_t < 28$ s are excluded, the burst behavior can be
described by a Poisson process. The best-fitting values of $k$ are slightly
different for low-energy ($E < 1.58\times10^{38}$ erg) and high-energy ($E >

of identities). This makes our approach more suitable for practical scenarios,
and it significantly reduces the need for computational resources. We also
propose a PartMixUp loss that improves the discriminative ability of learned

outperforms the state-of-the-art results on three large-scale person re-id

reduced to ~4.37 W/m-K in ZrCo0.9Ir0.1Sb. This observed reduction is ascribed
to softening of acoustic phonon modes and point defect scattering, on
substitution of heavier mass. However, no further reduction in \k{appa}L is
observed in ZrCo0.75Ir0.25Sb, because of identical scattering parameter. This

(below 500 K) and phonon-phonon scattering (above 750 K) are the dominant

different metal centres (MII = Fe, Co, Mn, Zn) in a solvent-free synthesis

antiferromagnetically with critical temperatures that depend on M. Furthermore,

interconnected by van der Waals interactions, a topology that is very rare in
the field of 2D materials and unprecedented for 2D magnets. These layered
materials are robust enough to be mechanically exfoliated down to a few layers

SlotRefine to train a punctuation correction model. To achieve better
translation performance, we explored the most recent effective strategies,
including back translation, knowledge distillation, multi-feature reranking and
transductive finetuning. For model structure, we tried auto-regressive and
non-autoregressive models, respectively. In addition, we proposed two novel
pre-train approaches, i.e. \textit{de-noising training} and
\textit{bidirectional training} to fully exploit the data. Extensive
experiments show that adding the above techniques consistently improves the

approximately 10.8 BLEU score, achieving the SOTA performance.

  Using Generative Adversarial Network",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reconstruction of image by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has
been vigorously studied in the last decade. Until now, there have being
developed several techniques for imaging of a single object through scattering
medium by using neural networks, however how to reconstruct images of more than
one object simultaneously seems hard to realize. In this paper, we demonstrate
an approach by using generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct images
of two adjacent objects through scattering media. We construct an imaging
system for imaging of two adjacent objects behind the scattering media. In
general, as the light field of two adjacent object images pass through the
scattering slab, a speckle pattern is obtained. The designed adversarial
network, which is called as YGAN, is employed to reconstruct the images
simultaneously. It is shown that based on the trained YGAN, we can reconstruct
images of two adjacent objects from one speckle pattern with high fidelity. In
addition, we study the influence of the object image types, and the distance
between the two adjacent objects on the fidelity of the reconstructed images.
Moreover even if another scattering medium is inserted between the two objects,
we can also reconstruct the images of two objects from a speckle with high
quality. The technique presented in this work can be used for applications in
areas of medical image analysis, such as medical image classification,
segmentation, and studies of multi-object scattering imaging etc.

recent years, but it is still challenging to enable VQA models to adaptively
generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Intuitively, recompositions of
existing visual concepts (\ie, attributes and objects) can generate unseen
compositions in the training set, which will promote VQA models to generalize
to OOD samples. In this paper, we formulate OOD generalization in VQA as a
compositional generalization problem and propose a graph generative
modeling-based training scheme (X-GGM) to implicitly model the problem. X-GGM
leverages graph generative modeling to iteratively generate a relation matrix
and node representations for the predefined graph that utilizes
attribute-object pairs as nodes. Furthermore, to alleviate the unstable
training issue in graph generative modeling, we propose a gradient distribution
consistency loss to constrain the data distribution with adversarial
perturbations and the generated distribution. The baseline VQA model (LXMERT)
trained with the X-GGM scheme achieves state-of-the-art OOD performance on two
standard VQA OOD benchmarks, \ie, VQA-CP v2 and GQA-OOD. Extensive ablation

corresponding optimum measurement is implemented at the receiver. We explore
the detection problem in different regions of the parameter space and verify
that the quantum advantage exists even in a forbidden region of the
conventional illumination, where all classical schemes become useless. Our
results indicate that quantum illumination breaks the classical limit for up to
40%, while approaching the quantum limit imposed by the Helstrom limit. These

instance when occupations are translated from a language like English, which
mostly uses gender neutral words, to a language like German, which mostly uses
a feminine and a masculine version for an occupation, a decision must be made
by the MT System. Recent research showed that MT systems are biased towards
stereotypical translation of occupations. In 2019 the first, and so far only,
challenge set, explicitly designed to measure the extent of gender bias in MT
systems has been published. In this set measurement of gender bias is solely
based on the translation of occupations. In this paper we present an extension

This has led to an active research area in FEEL studying the optimal device
scheduling policy for minimizing communication time. However, owing to the
difficulty in quantifying the exact communication time, prior work in this area
can only tackle the problem partially by considering either the communication
rounds or per-round latency, while the total communication time is determined
by both metrics. To close this gap, we make the first attempt in this paper to
formulate and solve the communication time minimization problem. We first
derive a tight bound to approximate the communication time through
cross-disciplinary effort involving both learning theory for convergence
analysis and communication theory for per-round latency analysis. Building on
the analytical result, an optimized probabilistic scheduling policy is derived
in closed-form by solving the approximate communication time minimization

if the pandemic had not happened) to estimate the magnitude of the change
caused by the pandemic. The results indicated that following a reduction in
cycle hires in March and April 2020, the demand rebounded from May 2020,
remaining in the expected range of what would have been if the pandemic had not
occurred. This could indicate the resiliency of Santander Cycles. With respect
to hire time, an important increase occurred in April, May, and June 2020,
indicating that bikes were hired for longer trips, perhaps partly due to a

significantly on the mass number of the primary cosmic ray particle. Nuclei are
sets of nucleons and it seems an obvious approximation to assume that the
extensive air showers initiated in the upper atmosphere by atomic nuclei are a
convolution of the showers generated by single nucleons. This is called the
superposition hypothesis. In this paper, we test this superposition model. We
will show, using results of a detailed simulation program CORSIKA, that the
superposition assumption is not fulfilled for higher moments of the
distributions of the main characteristics of extensive air showers. We will
discussed some extensions of the simply superposition model that ensure
consistency with the results of detailed simulations.

decision makers as well as market players. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to measure the economic uncertainties by using the Hidden Markov Model

and periods. We used the daily electricity consumption data of more than 18,000
firms in Shanghai from 2018 to 2020 to construct the ECU indexes. Results show
that all ECU indexes, whether at sectoral or regional level, successfully
captured the negative impacts of COVID-19 on Shanghai's economic conditions.
Besides, the ECU indexes also presented the heterogeneities in different
districts as well as in different sectors. This reflects the facts that changes
in the uncertainty of economic conditions are mainly related to regional
economic structures and targeted regulatory policies faced by sectors. The ECU
index can also be readily extended to measure the uncertainty of economic
conditions in various realms, which has great potentials in the future.

years due to the substantial losses caused by hacker attacks. Existing efforts
for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts,
which are labor-intensive and non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined
rules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by
crafty attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal
analysis of smart contracts for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a
precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to
detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that
considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks.
In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for
smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control-
and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. To highlight
the critical nodes in the graph, we further design a node elimination phase to
normalize the graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation
network to extract the graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the
graph feature with designed expert patterns to yield a final detection system.
Extensive experiments are conducted on all the smart contracts that have source
code in Ethereum and VNT Chain platforms. Empirical results show significant
accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on three types of
vulnerabilities, where the detection accuracy of our method reaches 89.15%,
89.02%, and 83.21% for reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and infinite loop

sum gives zero value at all time shifts in a zone around the $(0,0)$ time
shift, except the $(0,0)$ time shift. The first approach investigated in this
paper uses a one-dimensional (1-D) Z-complementary pair (ZCP), which is an
extension of the 1-D Golay complementary pair (GCP) where the autocorrelations
of constituent sequences are complementary within a zero correlation zone
(ZCZ). The second approach involves directly generalized Boolean functions
(which are important components with many applications, particularly in
(symmetric) cryptography). Along with this paper, new construction of 2-D ZCAPs
is proposed based on 1-D ZCP, and direct construction of 2-D ZCAPs is also
offered directly by 2-D generalized Boolean functions. Compared to existing
constructions based on generalized Boolean functions, our proposed construction
covers all of them. ZCZ sequences are a class of spreading sequences having
ideal auto-correlation and cross-correlation in a zone around the origin. In
recent years, they have been extensively studied due to their crucial
applications, particularly in quasi-synchronous code division multiple access
systems. Our proposed 2-D ZCAPs based on 2-D generalized Boolean functions have
larger 2-D $\mathrm{ZCZ}_{\mathrm{ratio}}=\frac{6}{7}$. Compared to the
construction based on ZCPs, our proposed 2-D ZCAPs also have the largest 2-D

enablers for future millimeter-wave (mm-wave) wireless communication. In this
paper, we investigate channel estimation for IRS-assisted mm-wave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {\color{black}wireles}s systems. By
leveraging the sparsity of mm-wave channels in the angular domain, we formulate
the channel estimation problem as an $\ell_1$-norm regularized optimization
problem with fixed-rank constraints. To tackle the non-convexity of the
formulated problem, an efficient algorithm is proposed by capitalizing on
alternating minimization and manifold optimization (MO), which yields a locally
optimal solution. To further reduce the computational complexity of the
estimation algorithm, we propose a compressive sensing- (CS-) based channel
estimation approach. In particular, a three-stage estimation protocol is put
forward where the subproblem in each stage can be solved via low-complexity CS
methods. Furthermore, based on the acquired channel state information (CSI) of
the cascaded channel, we design a passive beamforming algorithm for
maximization of the spectral efficiency. Simulation results reveal that the
proposed MO-based estimation (MO-EST) and beamforming algorithms significantly
outperform two benchmark schemes while the CS-based estimation (CS-EST)
algorithm strikes a balance between performance and complexity. In addition, we
demonstrate the robustness of the MO-EST algorithm with respect to imperfect

To eradicate large tail latencies from database systems, the ability to

imminently required. In this paper, we address the challenge of measuring tail
latencies using standard benchmarks, and identify subtle perils and pitfalls.
In particular, we demonstrate how Java-based benchmarking approaches can

whose metric satisfying certain conditions, the deflection of null rays with
fixed closest distance will not depend on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$,
while that of timelike signals and the apparent angle in gravitational lensing
still depend on $\Lambda$. A two-step perturbative method is then developed to
compute the change of the angular coordinate and total travel time in the weak
field limit. The results are quasi-series of two small quantities, with the
finite distance effect of the source/detector naturally taken into account.
These results are verified by applying to some known de Sitter spacetimes.
Using an exact gravitational lensing equation, we solved the apparent angles of
the images and time delays between them and studied the effect of $\Lambda$ on
them. It is found that generally, a small positive $\Lambda$ will decrease the
apparent angle of images from both sides of the lens and increase the time
delay between them. The time delay between signals from the same side of the
lens but with different energy however, will be decreased by $\Lambda$.

wind farms (WFs). Both turbine placement and cooperative control can influence
the wake interactions inside the WF and thus the overall WF power production.
Traditionally, greedy control strategy is assumed in the layout design phase.
To exploit the potential synergy between the WF layout and control so that a
system-level optimal layout can be obtained with the greatest energy yields,
the layout optimization should be performed with cooperative control
considerations. For this purpose, a novel two-stage WF layout optimization
model is developed in this paper. Cooperative WF control of both turbine yaw
and axis-induction are considered in the WF layout design. However, the
integration of WF control makes the layout optimization much more complicated
and results in a large-scale nonconvex problem, hindering the application of
current layout optimization methods. To increase the computational efficiency,
we leverage the hierarchy and decomposability of the joint optimization problem
and design a decomposition-based hybrid method (DBHM). Instead of manipulating
all the variables simultaneously, the joint optimization problem is decomposed
into several subproblems and their coordination. Case studies are carried out
on different WFs. It is shown that WF layouts with higher energy yields can be
obtained by the proposed joint optimization compared to traditional separate
layout optimization. Moreover, the computational advantages of the proposed
DBHM on the considered joint layout optimization problem are also demonstrated.

simplest form, one-way communication complexity, Alice and Bob compute a
function $f(x,y)$, where $x$ is given to Alice and $y$ is given to Bob, and
only one message from Alice to Bob is allowed. A fundamental question in
quantum information is the relationship between one-way quantum and classical
communication complexities, i.e., how much shorter the message can be if Alice
is sending a quantum state instead of bit strings? We make some progress
towards this question with the following results.
  Let $f: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow \mathcal{Z} \cup \{\bot\}$

$f^{-1}(\mathcal{Z})$. Denote $d=|\mathcal{Z}|$. Let

entanglement-assisted quantum one-way communication complexity of $f$, each
with distributional error (average error over $\mu$) at most $\epsilon$. We
show:
  1) If $\mu$ is a product distribution, $\eta > 0$ and $0 \leq \epsilon \leq

curvature diverges as we move towards the deep IR limit. We calculate the
holographic stress tensor and the central charge for the boundary theory. Our
analysis shows that the central charge goes as the inverse power of the
coupling associated to 4-derivative interactions. We also compute the Wald
entropy for 2D black holes and interpret its near horizon divergence in terms
of the density of states. We compare the Wald entropy with the Cardy formula
and obtain the eigen value of Virasoro operator ($L_0$) for our model. Finally,
we explore the near horizon structure of 2D black holes and calculate the
central charge corresponding to the CFT near horizon. We further show that the
near horizon CFT may be recast as a 2D Liouville theory with higher derivative
corrections. We study the Weyl invariance of this generalised Liouville theory
and identify the Weyl anomaly associated to it. We also comment on the
classical vacuum structure of the theory.

$G\approx{}G_{\rm Sharvin}=g_0k_F{}W/\pi$ (with $g_0$ the conductance quantum,
$k_F$ the Fermi momentum, and $W$ the contact width) accompanied by strongly
suppressed shot-noise quantified by small Fano factor $F\approx{}0$. For
ballistic graphene away from the charge-neutrality point the sub-Sharvin
transport occurs, characterised by suppressed conductance
$G\approx{}(\pi/4)\,G_{\rm Sharvin}$ and enhanced shot noise $F\approx{}1/8$.
All these results can be derived from a basic model of quantum scattering,
involving assumptions of infinite height and perfectly rectangular shape of the
potential barrier in the sample. Here we have carried out the numerical
analysis of the scattering on a family of smooth barriers of finite height
interpolating between parabollic and rectangular shapes. We find that tuning
the barrier shape one can modify the asymmetry between electron- and hole-doped
systems. For electronic dopings, the system crosses from Sharvin to sub-Sharvin
transport regime (indicated by both the conductance and the Fano factor) as the
potential becomes closer to the rectangular shape. In contrast, for hole
dopings, the conductivity is strongly suppressed when the barrier is parabolic
and slowly converges to $G\approx{}(\pi/4)\,G_{\rm Sharvin}$ as the potential
evolves towards rectangular shape. In such a case the Sharvin transport regime
is inaccessible, shot noise is generically enhanced (with much slower
convergence to $F\approx{}1/8$) comparing to the electron-doped case, and
aperiodic oscillations of both $G$ and $F$ are prominent due to the formation
of quasibound states.

  Estimation","Just some ideas of my own, not supported by experiments",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is expensive to evaluate the results of Machine Translation(MT), which
usually requires manual translation as a reference. Machine Translation Quality
Estimation (QE) is a task of predicting the quality of machine translations
without relying on any reference. Recently, the emergence of
predictor-estimator framework which trains the predictor as a feature extractor
and estimator as a QE predictor, and pre-trained language models(PLM) have
achieved promising QE performance. However, we argue that there are still gaps
between the predictor and the estimator in both data quality and training
objectives, which preclude QE models from benefiting from a large number of
parallel corpora more directly. Based on previous related work that have
alleviated gaps to some extent, we propose a novel framework that provides a
more accurate direct pretraining for QE tasks. In this framework, a generator
is trained to produce pseudo data that is closer to the real QE data, and a
estimator is pretrained on these data with novel objectives that are the same
as the QE task. Experiments on widely used benchmarks show that our proposed
framework outperforms existing methods, without using any pretraining models
such as BERT.

  periodic chain under general boundary conditions",,,"10.1121/10.0009229",,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bragg scattering in periodic media generates band gaps, frequency bands where
waves attenuate rather than propagate. Yet, a finite periodic structure may
exhibit resonance frequencies within these band gaps. This is caused by
boundary effects introduced by the truncation of the nominal infinite medium.
Previous studies of discrete systems determined existence conditions for
band-gap resonances, although the focus has been limited to periodic chains
with free-free boundaries. In this paper, we present closed-form existence
conditions for band-gap resonances in discrete diatomic chains with general
boundary conditions (free-free, free-fixed, fixed-free, or fixed-fixed), odd or
even chain parity (contrasting or identical masses at the ends), and the
possibility of attaching a unique component (mass and/or spring) at one or both
ends. The derived conditions are consistent with those theoretically presented
or experimentally observed in prior studies of structures that can be modeled
as linear discrete diatomic chains with free-free boundary conditions. An
intriguing case is a free-free chain with even parity and an arbitrary
additional mass at one end of the chain. Introducing such an arbitrary mass
underscores a transition among a set of distinct existence conditions depending
on the type of the chain boundaries and parity. The proposed analysis is
applicable to linear periodic chains in the form of lumped-parameter models as
well as continuous granular media models examined in the low-frequency regime.

using the first $n$ terms of the Chudnovskys' series, we obtain the finite
approximation $\pi_n\approx \pi$. It is known that the truncation error
satisfies $|\pi_n-\pi|\approx 53360^{-3n}.$ In this paper, we prove that the
asymptotic expansion for the truncation error in the Chudnovskys' series is
$$\left|\pi_n-\pi\right|=53360^{-3n}\cdot\frac{{106720}\sqrt{{10005}\pi}}{{1672209}\sqrt{n}}\cdot\exp\left(\frac{A_1}{n}+\frac{A_2}{n^2}+\frac{\delta_n}{n^3}\right),$$

Current diagnostic methods have several limitations leading to the suggestion
of eye-tracking for its diagnosis through in-attention. To ascertain the
requirements for an eye-tracking system in an adult ICU, measurements were
carried out at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Clinical
criteria guided empirical requirements of invasiveness and calibration methods
while accuracy and precision were measured. A non-invasive system was then
developed utilising a patient-facing RGB-camera and a scene-facing RGBD-camera.
The system's performance was measured in a replicated laboratory environment
with healthy volunteers revealing an accuracy and precision that outperforms
what is required while simultaneously being non-invasive and calibration-free
The system was then deployed as part CONfuSED, a clinical feasibility study
where we report aggregated data from 5 patients as well as the acceptability of
the system to bedside nursing staff. The system is the first eye-tracking

neural network, trained on a minimal amount of data, can predict the behavior
of spintronic devices with high accuracy and an extremely efficient simulation
time, compared to the micromagnetic simulations that are usually employed to
model them. For this purpose, we re-frame the formalism of Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) to the constraints of spintronics: few measured
outputs, multiple inputs and internal parameters. We demonstrate with
Spin-Neural ODEs an acceleration factor over 200 compared to micromagnetic
simulations for a complex problem -- the simulation of a reservoir computer
made of magnetic skyrmions (20 minutes compared to three days). In a second
realization, we show that we can predict the noisy response of experimental
spintronic nano-oscillators to varying inputs after training Spin-Neural ODEs
on five milliseconds of their measured response to different excitations.
Spin-Neural ODE is a disruptive tool for developing spintronic applications in
complement to micromagnetic simulations, which are time-consuming and cannot
fit experiments when noise or imperfections are present. Spin-Neural ODE can
also be generalized to other electronic devices involving dynamics.

materials has applications ranging from topology optimization to multi-scale
structural analysis. However, full-fidelity simulation techniques such as
Finite Element Analysis can be prohibitively computationally expensive when
they are used to explore the massive input parameter space of heterogeneous
materials. Therefore, there has been significant recent interest in machine
learning-based models that, once trained, can predict mechanical behavior at a
fraction of the computational cost. Over the past several years, research in
this area has been focused mainly on predicting single Quantities of Interest
(QoIs). However, there has recently been an increased interest in a more
challenging problem: predicting full-field QoI (e.g., displacement/strain
fields, damage fields) for mechanical problems. Due to the added complexity of
full-field information, network architectures that perform well on single QoI
problems may perform poorly in the full-field QoI problem setting. The work
presented in this paper is twofold. First, we made a significant extension to
the Mechanical MNIST dataset designed to enable the investigation of full field
QoI prediction. Specifically, we added Finite Element simulation results of
quasi-static brittle fracture in a heterogeneous material captured with the
phase-field method. Second, we established strong baseline performance for
predicting full-field QoI with MultiRes-WNet architecture. In addition to
presenting the results in this paper, we have released our model implementation
and the Mechanical MNIST Crack Path dataset under open-source licenses. We
anticipate that future researchers will directly use our model architecture on
related datasets and potentially design models that exceed the baseline
performance for predicting full-field QoI established in this paper.

Obtaining the flame images by means of a CCD camera mounted on a 10 cm diameter
observation port, {\lambda} data has been coordinately measured and recorded by
the flue gas analyzer. 2) Feature extraction: Gridding the flame image, it is
