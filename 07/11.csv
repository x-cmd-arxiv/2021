  Technology, 2020",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm control has applications including target
tracking, surveillance, terrain mapping, and precision agriculture.
Decentralized control methods are particularly useful when the swarm is large,
as centralized methods (a single command center controlling the UAVs) suffer
from exponential computational complexity, i.e., the computing time to obtain
the optimal control for the UAVs grow exponentially with the number of UAVs in
the swarm in centralized approaches. Although many centralized control methods
exist, literature lacks decentralized control frameworks with broad
applicability. To address this knowledge gap, we present a novel decentralized
UAV swarm control strategy using a decision-theoretic framework called
decentralized Markov decision process (Dec-MDP). We build these control
strategies in the context of two case studies: a) swarm formation control
problem; b) swarm control for multitarget tracking. As most decision theoretic
formulations suffer from the curse of dimensionality, we adapt an approximate
dynamic programming method called nominal belief-state optimization (NBO) to
solve the decentralized control problems approximately in both the case
studies. In the formation control case study, the objective is to drive the
swarm from a geographical region to another geographical region where the swarm
must form a certain geometrical shape (e.g., selected location on the surface
of a sphere). The motivation for studying such problems comes from data fusion
applications with UAV swarms where the fusion performance depends on the
strategic relative separation of the UAVs from each other. In the target
tracking case study, the objective is the control the motion of the UAVs in a
decentralized manner while maximizing the overall target tracking performance.
Motivation for this case study comes from the surveillance applications using
UAV swarms.

namely, the modified R\'enyi entropy (MRE), the Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME) and
the dual Kaniadakis entropy (DKE) in the investigation of the generalized
second law (GSL) of thermodynamics violation. The GSL is an extension of the
second law for black holes. Recently, it was concluded that a total entropy is
the sum of the entropy enclosed by the apparent horizon plus the entropy of the
horizon itself when the apparent horizon is described by the Barrow entropy. It
was assumed that the universe is filled with matter and dark energy fluids.
Here, the apparent horizon will be described by MRE, SME, and then by DKE
proposals. Since GSL holds for usual entropy, but it is conditionally violated
in the extended entropies, this implies that the parameter of these entropies
should be constrained in small values in order for the GSL to be satisfied.
Hence, we have established conditions where the second law of thermodynamics
can or cannot be obeyed considering these three statistical concepts just as it
was made in Barrow's entropy. Considering the $\Lambda CDM$ cosmology we can
observe that for MRE, SME and DKE, the GSL of thermodynamics is not obeyed for
small redshift values.

Multilayer Perceptrons, the deep network itself can be regarded as a

irrevocable decision among a fixed number of candidate choices that are

optimal solution is known to reject an initial sequence of candidates, a
paradox emerges from the fact that candidates have an incentive to position
themselves immediately after this cutoff which challenges the assumption that
candidates arrive in uniformly random order.
  One way to resolve this is to consider games for which every (reasonable)
strategy results in the same probability of success. In this work, we classify
these ""strategy-indifferent"" games of best choice. It turns out that the
probability of winning such a game is essentially the reciprocal of the
expected number of left-to-right maxima in the full collection of candidate

permutation patterns of size 3, which involves computing the distribution of

An interesting feature of such estimate is that we consider the measure which

approach named PatentMiner to mine rich semantic knowledge and predict new
potential patents based on knowledge graph (KG) and graph attention mechanism.
Firstly, patent knowledge graph over time (e.g. year) is constructed by
carrying out named entity recognition and relation extrac-tion from patent
documents. Secondly, Common Neighbor Method (CNM), Graph Attention Networks
(GAT) and Context-enhanced Graph Attention Networks (CGAT) are proposed to
perform link prediction in the constructed knowledge graph to dig out the
potential triples. Finally, patents are defined on the knowledge graph by means
of co-occurrence relationship, that is, each patent is represented as a fully
connected subgraph containing all its entities and co-occurrence relationships
of the patent in the knowledge graph; Furthermore, we propose a new patent
prediction task which predicts a fully connected subgraph with newly added
prediction links as a new pa-tent. The experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed patent predic-tion approach can correctly predict new patents and
Context-enhanced Graph Attention Networks is much better than the baseline.

shown great potentials in exploiting raw data information and representation
learning. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning
(HSSL), a new self-supervised framework that boosts medical image segmentation
by making good use of unannotated data. Unlike the current literature on
task-specific self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning,
we utilize SSL to learn task-agnostic knowledge from heterogeneous data for
various medical image segmentation tasks. Specifically, we first aggregate a
dataset from several medical challenges, then pre-train the network in a
self-supervised manner, and finally fine-tune on labeled data. We develop a new
loss function by combining contrastive loss and classification loss and
pretrain an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation tasks. Our extensive
experiments show that multi-domain joint pre-training benefits downstream
segmentation tasks and outperforms single-domain pre-training significantly.
Compared to learning from scratch, our new method yields better performance on
various tasks (e.g., +0.69% to +18.60% in Dice scores with 5% of annotated
data). With limited amounts of training data, our method can substantially
bridge the performance gap w.r.t. denser annotations (e.g., 10% vs.~100% of

""superkick"" binary black hole systems (those with equal mass and anti-parallel
spins). We find a universal way to describe the mass and current quadrupole
gravitational waves emitted by these systems during the merger and ringdown
stage: (i) The time evolutions of these waves are insensitive to the
progenitor's parameters (spins) after being normalized by their own peak
values. (ii) The peak values, which encode all the spin information of the
progenitor, can be consistently fitted to formulas inspired by post-Newtonian
theory. We find that the universal evolution of the mass quadrupole wave can be
accurately modeled by the so-called Backwards One-Body (BOB) model. However,
the BOB model, in its present form, leads to a lower waveform match and a
significant parameter-estimation bias for the current quadrupole wave. We also
decompose the ringdown signal into seven overtones, and study the dependence of
mode amplitudes on the progenitor's parameters. Such dependence is found to be
insensitive to the overtone index (up to a scaling factor). Finally, we use the
Fisher matrix technique to investigate how the ringdown waveform can be at
least as important for parameter estimation as the inspiral stage. Assuming the
Cosmic Explorer, we find the contribution of ringdown portion dominates as the
total mass exceeds ~ 250 solar mass. For massive BBH systems, the accuracy of
parameter measurement is improved by incorporating the information of ringdown
-- the ringdown sector gives rise to a different parameter correlation from
inspiral stage, hence the overall parameter correlation is reduced in the full
signal.

non-commutative) *-algebras that are equipped with a Poisson bracket and a
Hamiltonian action of a commutative Lie algebra $g$. The key idea advocated for
in this article is that the ""correct"" notion of positivity on a *-algebra $A$
is not necessarily the algebraic one whose positive elements are the sums of
Hermitian squares $a^* a$ with $a \in A$, but can be a more general one that
depends on the example at hand, like pointwise positivity on *-algebras of
functions or positivity in a representation as operators. The notion of states
(normalized positive Hermitian linear functionals) on $A$ thus depends on this
choice of positivity on $A$, and the notion of positivity on the reduced
algebra $A_{red}$ should be such that states on $A_{red}$ are obtained as
reductions of certain states on $A$. In the special case of the *-algebra of
smooth functions on a Poisson manifold $M$, this reduction scheme reproduces
the coisotropic reduction of $M$, where the reduced manifold $M_{red}$ is just
a geometric manifestation of the reduction of the evaluation functionals
associated to certain points of $M$. However, we are mainly interested in
applications to non-formal deformation quantization and therefore also discuss
the reduction of the Weyl algebra, and of the polynomial algebra whose
non-commutative analogs we plan to examine in future projects.

transactions and smart contracts, but they exhibit limitations on the
transaction throughput, storage, and computation. To avoid transaction
gridlock, public blockchains impose large fees and per-block resource limits,
making it difficult to accommodate the ever-growing transaction demand.
Previous research endeavors to improve the scalability of blockchain through
various technologies, such as side-chaining, sharding, secured off-chain
computation, communication network optimizations, and efficient consensus
protocols. However, these approaches have not attained a widespread adoption
due to their inability in delivering a cloud-like performance, in terms of the
scalability in transaction throughput, storage, and compute capacity. In this
work, we determine that the major obstacle to public blockchain scalability is
their underlying unstructured P2P networks. We further show that a centralized
network can support the deployment of decentralized smart contracts. We propose
a novel approach for achieving scalable decentralization: instead of trying to
make blockchain scalable, we deliver decentralization to already scalable cloud
by using an Ethereum smart contract. We introduce Blockumulus, a framework that
can deploy decentralized cloud smart contract environments using a novel
technique called overlay consensus. Through experiments, we demonstrate that
Blockumulus is scalable in all three dimensions: computation, data storage, and
transaction throughput. Besides eliminating the current code execution and
storage restrictions, Blockumulus delivers a transaction latency between 2 and
5 seconds under normal load. Moreover, the stress test of our prototype reveals
the ability to execute 20,000 simultaneous transactions under 26 seconds, which
is on par with the average throughput of worldwide credit card transactions.

are degenerate with non-collinear and non-coplanar ones: this degeneracy is
accidental and is expected to be lifted by anisotropic exchange interactions.
In this work, we derive the most general nearest and next-nearest neighbor
exchange model allowed by the space-group symmetry of the noncentrosymmetric
half-Heusler compounds, which includes three anisotropic terms: the so-called
Kitaev, Gamma and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions -- most notably, the

compute the resulting phase diagram and show how the different terms lift the

regimes where multi-q (non-collinear/non-coplanar) states are selected by
anisotropy. We then discuss the role of quantum fluctuations and the coupling
to a magnetic field in the ground state selection, and show that these effects
can stabilize non-coplanar (triple-q) states. These results suggest that some

estimator as a deep quantile regression (DQR) estimator. We show that the DQR
estimator achieves the nonparametric optimal convergence rate up to a
logarithmic factor determined by the intrinsic dimension of the underlying
compositional structure of the conditional quantile function, not the ambient
dimension of the predictor. Therefore, DQR is able to mitigate the curse of
dimensionality under the assumption that the conditional quantile function has
a compositional structure. To establish these results, we analyze the
approximation error of a composite function by neural networks and show that
the error rate only depends on the dimensions of the component functions. We
apply our general results to several important statistical models often used in
mitigating the curse of dimensionality, including the single index, the
additive, the projection pursuit, the univariate composite, and the generalized

To mitigate these risks, it is important to have a system that can detect or
identify the presence of an intruding UAV in a restricted environment. In this
work, we propose a radio frequency (RF) based UAV detection and identification
system by exploiting signals emanating from both the UAV and its flight
controller, respectively. While several RF devices (i.e., Bluetooth and WiFi
devices) operate in the same frequency band as UAVs, the proposed framework
utilizes a semi-supervised learning approach for the detection of UAV or UAV's
control signals in the presence of other wireless signals such as Bluetooth and
WiFi. The semi-supervised learning approach uses stacked denoising autoencoder
and local outlier factor algorithms. After the detection of UAV or UAV's
control signals, the signal is decomposed by using Hilbert-Huang transform and
wavelet packet transform to extract features from the time-frequency-energy
domain of the signal. The extracted feature sets are used to train a
three-level hierarchical classifier for identifying the type of signals (i.e.,
UAV or UAV control signal), UAV models, and flight mode of UAV. To demonstrate
the feasibility of the proposed framework, we carried out an outdoor experiment

mechanical devices found in aviation industry has raised security concerns. The
more integrated the system, the more vulnerable due to the inherent
vulnerabilities found in ICT tools and software that drives the system. The
security concerns have become more heightened as the concept of
electronic-enabled aircraft and smart airports get refined and implemented
underway. In line with the above, this paper undertakes a review of
cyber-security incidence in the aviation sector over the last 20 years. The
essence is to understand the common threat actors, their motivations, the type
of attacks, aviation infrastructure that is commonly attacked and then match
these so as to provide insight on the current state of the cyber-security in
the aviation sector. The review showed that the industry's threats come mainly
from Advance Persistent Threat (APT) groups that work in collaboration with
some state actors to steal intellectual property and intelligence, in order to
advance their domestic aerospace capabilities as well as possibly monitor,
infiltrate and subvert other nations' capabilities. The segment of the aviation
industry commonly attacked is the Information Technology infrastructure, and
the prominent type of attacks is malicious hacking activities that aim at
gaining unauthorised access using known malicious password cracking techniques
such as Brute force attacks, Dictionary attacks and so on. The review further
analysed the different attack surfaces that exist in aviation industry, threat
dynamics, and use these dynamics to predict future trends of cyberattacks in
the industry. The aim is to provide information for the cybersecurity
professionals and aviation stakeholders for proactive actions in protecting
these critical infrastructures against cyberincidence for an optimal customer
service oriented industry.

ordered solution spaces to compute concepts, which are used as binary
classification models for individuals. However, the number of concepts explored
by these approaches can grow to the millions for complex learning problems.
This often leads to impractical runtimes. We propose to alleviate this problem
by predicting the length of target concepts before the exploration of the
solution space. By these means, we can prune the search space during concept
learning. To achieve this goal, we compare four neural architectures and
evaluate them on four benchmarks. Our evaluation results suggest that recurrent
neural network architectures perform best at concept length prediction with a
macro F-measure ranging from 38% to 92%. We then extend the CELOE algorithm,
which learns ALC concepts, with our concept length predictor. Our extension
yields the algorithm CLIP. In our experiments, CLIP is at least 7.5 times
faster than other state-of-the-art concept learning algorithms for ALC --
including CELOE -- and achieves significant improvements in the F-measure of
the concepts learned on 3 out of 4 datasets. For reproducibility, we provide
our implementation in the public GitHub repository at

of large-area transfer to maintain wafer-scale fabrication standards. Here, a
facile route to transfer centimeter-scale synthesized 2D TMDCs (3L MoS2, 1L
WS2) onto various substrates such as sapphire, SiO2/Si, and flexible substrates
(mica, polyimide) has been developed using a water-soluble layer (Na2S/Na2SO4)
underneath the as-grown film. The developed transfer process represents a fast,
clean, generic, and scalable technique to transfer 2D atomic layers. The key
strategy used in this process includes the dissolution of Na2S/Na2SO4 layer due
to the penetration of NaOH solution between the growth substrate and
hydrophobic 2D TMDC film. As a proof-of-concept device, a broadband
photodetector has been fabricated onto transferred 3L MoS2, which shows
photoresponse behavior for a wide range of wavelength ranging from NIR to UV.
The enhancement in photocurrent was found to be 100 times and 10 times to dark

gravitational-wave (GW) detectors which is expected to limit their
low-frequency sensitivity in upcoming observing runs. Seismic NN is produced by
seismic waves passing near a detector's suspended test masses. It is predicted
to be the strongest contribution to NN. Modeling this contribution accurately
is a major challenge. Arrays of seismometers were deployed at the Virgo site to
characterize the seismic field near the four test masses. In this paper, we
present results of a spectral analysis of the array data from one of Virgo's
end buildings to identify dominant modes of the seismic field. Some of the
modes can be associated with known seismic sources. Analyzing the modes over a
range of frequencies, we provide a dispersion curve of Rayleigh waves. We find
that the Rayleigh speed in the NN frequency band 10 Hz - 20 Hz is very low
($\lesssim$100\,m/s), which has important consequences for Virgo's seismic NN.
Using the new speed estimate, we find that the recess formed under the
suspended test masses by a basement level at the end buildings leads to a 10
fold reduction of seismic NN.

relevant clinical setups: building a sufficiently accurate model on the minimum
possible amount of annotated data. Existing methods mostly fine-tune specific
layers of the pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, there is
no consensus on which layers are better to fine-tune, e.g. the first layers for
images with low-level domain shift or the deeper layers for images with
high-level domain shift. To this end, we propose SpotTUnet - a CNN architecture

More specifically, on the target domain, our method additionally learns the
policy that indicates whether a specific layer should be fine-tuned or reused
from the pretrained network. We show that our method performs at the same level

obstacle to this extension is the potential unboundedness or emptiness of the

the usual convergence theory when the function is locally Lipschitz. Moreover,
if the algorithm does not drive a certain measure of criticality to zero, then
the iterates must converge to a point at which either the Clarke
subdifferential is empty or the direction of steepest descent is degenerate in

characterized by a difference between the entropies of the two ensembles that
is of the same order as the entropies themselves) form. However, recent
research on networks has shown that the presence of an extensive number of
local constraints can lead to ensemble nonequivalence even in the absence of
phase transitions. This occurs in a `weak' (i.e. leading to a subleading
entropy difference) but remarkably `unrestricted' (i.e. valid in the entire

nonequivalence in arbitrary ensembles of matrices with given margins. These
models have widespread applications in the study of spatially heterogeneous

multivariate financial and neural time-series, multi-platform social activity,

nonequivalence appears in `unrestricted' form throughout the entire parameter
space due to the extensivity of local constraints. Surprisingly, at the same
time it can also exhibit the `strong' form. This novel, simultaneously `strong

where a model of the data is learned to answer the queries. However, such
modelling choices fail to utilize any query specific information. To capture
such information, we observe that RAQs can be represented by query functions,
which are functions that take a query instance (i.e., a specific RAQ) as an

can be represented by functions is not specific to RAQs. Thus, we investigate
whether NeuroDB can be used for other query types, by applying it to distance
to nearest neighbour queries. We experimentally show that NeuroDB outperforms
the state-of-the-art for this query type, often by orders of magnitude.
Moreover, the same neural network architecture as for RAQs is used, bringing to

First, the traffic events are stochastic, both temporally and spatially.
Second, the problem has a non-homogeneous structure as the traffic events
arrive at different locations of the road network at different rates.
Accordingly, some locations require more visits by the robots compared to other
locations. To address these issues, we define an uncertainty metric for each
location of the road network and formulate a path planning problem for the
aerial robots to minimize the network's average uncertainty. We express this
problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose a

the TMC to send/receive real-time information about the traffic events. Hence,
the agents have global and real-time knowledge of the environment. However, in
the second scenario, we consider a challenging setting where the observation of
the aerial robots is partial and limited to their sensing ranges. Moreover, in
contrast to the first scenario, the information exchange between the aerial
robots and the TMC is restricted to specific time instances. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed algorithm in both scenarios for a real road network

global climate targets under the Paris Agreement. Here we estimate the costs of
hybrid power plants - lithium-ion battery storage with wind and solar PV - to
replace coal generation. We design least cost mixes of these technologies to
supply stylized baseload and load-following generation profiles in three Indian
states - Karnataka, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu. Our analysis shows that
availability of low cost capital, solar PV capital costs of at least $250/kW,
and battery storage capacity costs at least 50% cheaper than current levels
will be required to phase out existing coal power plants. Phaseout by 2040
requires a 6% annual decline in the cost of hybrid systems over the next two
decades. We find that replacing coal generation with hybrid systems 99% of the
hours over multiple decades is roughly 40% cheaper than 100% replacement,
indicating a key role for other low cost grid flexibility mechanisms to help
hasten coal phaseout. Solar PV is more suited to pairing with short duration
storage than wind power. Overall, our results describe the challenging
technological and policy advances needed to achieve the temperature goals of
the Paris Agreement.

is partly due to the complexity in adapting the different modalities of

long-term dependencies of pixels across spatiotemporal dimensions. The
correlation features are highly associated with action classes and proven their
effectiveness in accurate video feature extraction through the supervised
action recognition task. Yet correlation features of the same action would
differ across domains due to domain shift. Therefore we propose a novel
Adversarial Correlation Adaptation Network (ACAN) to align action videos by
aligning pixel correlations. ACAN aims to minimize the distribution of

Additionally, video DA research is also limited by the lack of cross-domain
video datasets with larger domain shifts. We, therefore, introduce a novel
HMDB-ARID dataset with a larger domain shift caused by a larger statistical
difference between domains. This dataset is built in an effort to leverage
current datasets for dark video classification. Empirical results demonstrate

to be spatially close to the cluster centre. We evaluated our method on 2
public medical image datasets and compared it to existing conventional and

  21)",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  HotStuff is a state-of-the-art Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocol.
It can be pipelined to build large-scale blockchains. One of its variants
called LibraBFT is adopted in Facebook's Libra blockchain. Although it is well
known that pipelined HotStuff is secure against up to $1/3$ of Byzantine nodes,
its performance in terms of throughput and delay is still under-explored. In
this paper, we develop a multi-metric evaluation framework to quantitatively
analyze pipelined \mbox{HotStuff's performance} with respect to its chain
growth rate, chain quality, and latency. We then propose two attack strategies
and evaluate their effects on the performance of pipelined HotStuff. Our
analysis shows that the chain growth rate (resp, chain quality) of pipelined
HotStuff under our attacks can drop to as low as 4/9 (resp, 12/17) of that
without attacks when $1/3$ nodes are Byzantine. As another application, we use
our framework to evaluate certain engineering optimizations adopted by
LibraBFT. We find that these optimizations make the system more vulnerable to
our attacks than the original pipelined HotStuff. Finally, we provide two
countermeasures to thwart these attacks. We hope that our studies can shed
light on the rigorous understanding of the state-of-the-art pipelined HotStuff
protocol as well as its variants.

  Emergence of Fluctuations",,,,,"cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper, we study the evolution of opinions over social networks with
bounded confidence in social cliques. Node initial opinions are independently
and identically distributed; at each time step, nodes review the average
opinions of a randomly selected local clique. The clique averages may represent
local group pressures on peers. Then nodes update their opinions under bounded
confidence: only when the difference between an agent individual opinion and
the corresponding local clique pressure is below a threshold, this agent
opinion is updated according to the DeGroot rule as a weighted average of the
two values. As a result, this opinion dynamics is a generalization of the
classical Deffuant-Weisbuch model in which only pairwise interactions take
place. First of all, we prove conditions under which all node opinions converge
to finite limits. We show that in the limits the event that all nodes achieve a
consensus, and the event that all nodes achieve pairwise distinct limits, i.e.,
social disagreements, are both nontrivial events. Next, we show that opinion
fluctuations may take place in the sense that at least one agent in the network
fails to hold a converging opinion trajectory. In fact, we prove that this
fluctuation event happens with a strictly positive probability, and also
constructively present an initial value event under which the fluctuation event
arises with probability one. These results add to the understanding of the role
of bounded confidence in social opinion dynamics, and the possibility of
fluctuation reveals that bringing in cliques in Deffuant-Weisbuch models have
fundamentally changed the behavior of such opinion dynamical processes.

the flatness factor of acceleration components, $F_a$, increases gradually for
$M_t \in [0.3, 1]$. On the contrary, $F_a$ for light particles develops a
maximum around $M_t \sim 0.6$. The PDF of longitudinal acceleration of tracers
is increasingly skewed towards the negative value as $M_t$ increases. By
contrast, for light particles, the skewness factor of longitudinal
acceleration, $S_a$, firstly becomes more negative with the increase of $M_t$,
and then goes back to $0$ when $M_t$ is larger than $0.6$. Similarly,
differences among tracers and light particles appear also in the zero-crossing

presentation and controls (user interface). Empirical studies of online
conflict suggest that the exposure diversity intervention proposed as an
antidote to ""filter bubbles"" can be improved and can even worsen polarization
under some conditions. Using civility metrics in conjunction with diversity in
content selection may be more effective. However, diversity-based interventions
have not been tested at scale and may not work in the diverse and dynamic
contexts of real platforms. Instead, intervening in platform polarization
dynamics will likely require continuous monitoring of polarization metrics,
such as the widely used ""feeling thermometer."" These metrics can be used to
evaluate product features, and potentially engineered as algorithmic

$E_{\rm F}$ are consistent with the large density of states at $E_{\rm F}$.
These results are important to understand the physical properties as well as
the possibility of the emergence of superconductivity in related materials.

explore the possibility of such a joint explanation in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Assuming no universality between smuon
and selectron soft masses, we find out a part of parameter space for a joint
explanation at $2\sigma$ level, i.e., $\mu M_1,\mu M_2<0$, $m_{L1}, m_{E2}<200$

$|M_1|<125$ GeV and $\mu<400$ GeV. This part of parameter space can survive LHC
and LEP constraints, but gives an over-abundance for dark matter if the
bino-like lightest neutralino is assumed to be the dark matter candidate. With
the assumption that the dark matter candidate is a superWIMP (say a
pseudo-goldstino in multi-sector SUSY breaking scenarios, whose mass can be as
light as GeV and produced from the late-decay of the thermally freeze-out
lightest neutralino), the dark matter problem can be avoided. So, we conclude
that the MSSM may give a joint explanation for the muon and electron $g-2$
anomalies at $2\sigma$ level (the muon $g-2$ anomaly can be even ameliorated to
$1\sigma$).

ferromagnetism in conducting oxide thin films and heterostructures. Here,
magnetotransport is investigated in a non-magnetic uniformly La-doped SrSnO3
film grown using hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. A 12 nm La:SrSnO3/2 nm
SrSnO3/GdScO3 (110) film with insulating behavior exhibited a robust hysteresis
loop in the MR at T < 5 K accompanied by an anomaly at ~ +/- 3 T at T < 2.5 K.
Furthermore, MR with the field in-plane yielded a value exceeded 100% at 1.8 K.
Using detailed temperature-, angle- and magnetic field-dependent resistance
measurements, we illustrate the origin of hysteresis is not due to magnetism in
the film but rather is associated with the magnetocaloric effect of the GdScO3
substrate. Given GdScO3 and similar substrates are commonly used in complex
oxide research, this work highlights the importance of thermal coupling to
processes in the substrates which must be carefully accounted for in the data
interpretation for thin films and heterostructures utilizing these substrates.

it is possible to measure the deformation only by scanning the electric

play a key role in determining the RO models' tractability, robustness, and
conservativeness. Different types of uncertainty sets have been proposed that
model uncertainty from various perspectives. Among them, polyhedral uncertainty
sets are widely used due to their simplicity and flexible structure to model
the underlying uncertainty. However, the conventional polyhedral uncertainty
sets present certain disadvantages; some are too conservative while others lead
to computationally expensive RO models. This paper proposes a systematic
approach to develop data-driven polyhedral uncertainty sets that mitigate these
drawbacks. The proposed uncertainty sets are polytopes induced by a given set
of scenarios, capture correlation information between uncertain parameters, and
allow for direct trade-offs between tractability and conservativeness issue of
conventional polyhedral uncertainty sets. To develop these uncertainty sets, we
use principal component analysis (PCA) to transform the correlated scenarios
into their uncorrelated principal components and to shrink the uncertainty
space dimensionality. Thus, decision-makers can use the number of the leading
principal components as a tool to trade-off tractability, conservativeness, and
robustness of RO models. We quantify the quality of the lower bound of a static
RO problem with a scenario-induced uncertainty set by deriving a theoretical
bound on the optimality gap. Additionally, we derive probabilistic guarantees
for the performance of the proposed scenario-induced uncertainty sets by
developing explicit lower bounds on the number of scenarios. Finally, we
demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed uncertainty sets to
trade-off tractability, robustness, and conservativeness by examining a range

dataset. Following this observation, this paper makes the following main
contributions: (1) characterizing the effect of sampling on algorithm
performance, in terms of algorithm and dataset characteristics (e.g. sparsity
characteristics, sequential dynamics, etc.); and (2) designing SVP-CF, which is
a data-specific sampling strategy, that aims to preserve the relative
performance of models after sampling, and is especially suited to long-tail
interaction data. Detailed experiments show that SVP-CF is more accurate than
commonly used sampling schemes in retaining the relative ranking of different
recommendation algorithms.

naturally arise in several applications in time series. These include the
update and prediction step of the stationary Kalman filter equations and the
prediction of bivariate time series. The celebrated Wiener-Hopf technique is
usually used for solving these equations and is based on a comparison of
coefficients in a Fourier series expansion. However, a statistical
interpretation of both the method and solution is opaque. The purpose of this
note is to revisit the (discrete) Wiener-Hopf equations and obtain an
alternative solution that is more aligned with classical techniques in time
series analysis. Specifically, we propose a solution to the Wiener-Hopf
equations that combines linear prediction with deconvolution.
  The Wiener-Hopf solution requires the spectral factorization of the
underlying spectral density function. For ease of evaluation it is often
assumed that the spectral density is rational. This allows one to obtain a
computationally tractable solution. However, this leads to an approximation
error when the underlying spectral density is not a rational function. We use
the proposed solution with Baxter's inequality to derive an error bound for the
rational spectral density approximation.

phenomena, predict, and make decisions. In the large sample limit, sound and
complete causal discovery algorithms have been previously introduced, where a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), or its equivalence class, representing causal

is available, which limits the power of statistical tests used by these
algorithms, leading to errors in the inferred causal model. This is commonly
addressed by devising a strategy for using as few as possible statistical
tests. In this paper, we introduce such a strategy in the form of a recursive
wrapper for existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms, which
preserves soundness and completeness. It recursively clusters the observed
variables using the normalized min-cut criterion from the outset, and uses a
baseline causal discovery algorithm during backtracking for learning local
sub-graphs. It then combines them and ensures completeness. By an ablation
study, using synthetic data, and by common real-world benchmarks, we
demonstrate that our approach requires significantly fewer statistical tests,
learns more accurate graphs, and requires shorter run-times than the baseline

linear boundary conditions. In such boundary conditions, a $n$ dimensional
parameter dependence is also assumed. Moreover, some comparison principles are
obtained.
  The explicit expression depends on the value of the Green's function related
to the two-point homogeneous problem, that is, we are assuming that when all
the parameters involved on the boundary conditions take the value zero then the
problem has a unique solution which is characterized by the corresponding
Green's function $g$. The expression of the Green's function $G$ of the general
problem is given as a function of $g$ and the real parameters considered at the
boundary conditions.
  It is important to show that, in order to ensure the uniqueness of solutions
of the linear considered problem, we must assume a non resonant additional
condition on the considered problem, which depends on the non local conditions
and the corresponding parameters.
  We point out that the assumption of the uniqueness of solutions of the
two-point homogeneous problem is not a necessary condition to ensure the
solution of the general case. Of course, in this situation the expression we
are looking for must be obtained in a different manner.
  To show the applicability of the obtained results, a particular example is
given.

The models correctly identify low energy molecules in the database and produce
novel isomers not found in the training set. Finally, we apply the model to

advancing data processing and machine learning (ML). Improving predictive power
was the focus of previous representation techniques, which unfortunately
perform rather poorly on the interpretability in terms of extracting underlying
insights of the data. Recently, the Kolmogorov model (KM) was studied, which is
an interpretable and predictable representation approach to learning the
underlying probabilistic structure of a set of random variables. The existing
KM learning algorithms using semi-definite relaxation with randomization
(SDRwR) or discrete monotonic optimization (DMO) have, however, limited utility
to big data applications because they do not scale well computationally. In
this paper, we propose a computationally scalable KM learning algorithm, based
on the regularized dual optimization combined with enhanced gradient descent
(GD) method. To make our method more scalable to large-dimensional problems, we
propose two acceleration schemes, namely, the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD)
elimination strategy and an approximate EVD algorithm. Furthermore, a
thresholding technique by exploiting the error bound analysis and leveraging
the normalized Minkowski $\ell_1$-norm, is provided for the selection of the
number of iterations of the approximate EVD algorithm. When applied to big data
applications, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve
compatible training/prediction performance with significantly reduced
computational complexity; roughly two orders of magnitude improvement in terms
of the time overhead, compared to the existing KM learning algorithms.
Furthermore, it is shown that the accuracy of logical relation mining for
interpretability by using the proposed KM learning algorithm exceeds $80\%$.

finding the optimal solution is exponentially hard using classical computers.
Here, we apply the QAOA for the ML detection by encoding the problem of
interest into a level-p QAOA circuit having 2p variational parameters, which
can be optimized by classical optimizers. This level-p QAOA circuit is
constructed by applying the prepared Hamiltonian to our problem and the initial
Hamiltonian alternately in p consecutive rounds. More explicitly, we first
encode the optimal solution of the ML detection problem into the ground state
of a problem Hamiltonian. Using the quantum adiabatic evolution technique, we
provide both analytical and numerical results for characterizing the evolution
of the eigenvalues of the quantum system used for ML detection. Then, for
level-1 QAOA circuits, we derive the analytical expressions of the expectation

Explicitly, we evaluate the computational complexity of the classical optimizer

novel concept proposed to provide per-flow shaping for a flow aggregate without
per-flow queuing. This concept has been adopted by Time-Sensitive Networking
(TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet). An appealing property of
interleaved shaping is that, when an interleaved shaper is appended to a FIFO
system, it does not increase the worst-case delay of the system. Based on this
""shaping-for-free"" property, an approach has been introduced to deliver bounded
end-to-end latency. Specifically, at each output link of a node, class-based
aggregate scheduling is used together with one interleaved shaper per-input
link and per-class, and the interleaved shaper re-shapes every flow to its
initial traffic constraint. In this paper, we investigate other properties of
interleaved LRQ shapers, particularly as stand-alone elements. In addition,
under per-flow setting, we also investigate per-flow LRQ based flow aggregation
and derive its properties. The analysis focuses directly on the timing of
operations, such as shaping and scheduling, in the network. This timing based
method can be found in the Guaranteed Rate (GR) server model and more generally
the max-plus branch of network calculus. With the derived properties, we not
only show that an improved end-to-end latency bound can be obtained for the
current approach, but also demonstrate with two examples that new approaches
may be devised. End-to-end delay bounds for the three approaches are derived
and compared. As a highlight, the two new approaches do not require different
node architectures in allocating (shaping / scheduling) queues, which implies
that they can be readily adapted for use in TSN and DetNet. This together with
the derived properties of LRQ shed new insights on providing the TSN / DetNet
qualities of service.

chronic liver disease associated with cirrhosis, which is diagnosed by the
measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). However, HVPG
measurement is invasive and therefore difficult to be widely applied in
clinical routines. There is no currently available technique to measure HVPG
noninvasively. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used for noninvasive
measurement of vascular pressure gradient in the intracranial and coronary
arteries. However, it has been scarcely employed in the hepatic vessel system
due to the difficulties in reconstructing precise vascular anatomies and
setting appropriate boundary conditions. Several computer tomography and
ultrasound based studies have verified the effectiveness of virtual HVPG
(vHVPG) by directly connecting the portal veins and hepatic veins before CFD
simulations. We apply the latest techniques of phase-contrast magnetic
resonance imaging (PC-MRI) and DIXON to obtain the velocity and vessel
anatomies at the same time. Besides, we improve the CFD pipeline in regards to
the construction of vessel connections and reduction of calculation time. The
proposed method shows high accuracy in the CSPH diagnosis in a study containing
ten healthy volunteers and five patients. The MRI-based noninvasive HVPG
measurement is promising in the clinical application of CSPH diagnosis.

galaxies have stellar populations in the outer disks that are older, more metal
poor and less dusty than in the inner disks. Recent bursts of star formation
have occurred more frequently in the outer disk, but extinction-corrected
Halpha equivalent widths are significantly lower at fixed D_n(4000) in these
regions. I examine the properties of a subset of galaxies with the the most
H$\alpha$ deficient outer disks. These regions contain young stellar
populations that must have formed within the last 0.5 Gyr, but
extinction-corrected Halpha values well below the values predicted for a
standard Kroupa IMF. The Halpha deficient galaxies have flat D_n(4000) and
Hdelta_A profiles with little radial fluctuation, indicating that star
formation has occurred extremely uniformly across the entire disk. The
H$\alpha$ line profiles indicate that the ionized gas kinematics is also very
regular across the disk. The main clue to the origin of the Halpha deficiency
is that it sets in at the same radius where the dust extinction abruptly
decreases, suggesting a mode of star formation deficient in massive stars in
quiescent, HI-dominated gas. Finally, I have carried out a search for galaxies
with signatures of unusual Halpha kinematics and find that 15% of the sample

Angstrom break is either flat or rising towards the center of the galaxy,
indicating that the central regions host evolved stars, but the H$\alpha$
equivalent width also rises steeply in the central regions. The ionization
parameter [OIII]/[OII] is typically low in these galactic centers, indicating
that ionizing sources are stellar rather than AGN. Wolf Rayet features

observe that class imbalance in SSOD severely impedes the effectiveness of
self-training. To address the class imbalance, we propose adaptive
class-rebalancing self-training (ACRST) with a novel memory module called

Owing to the high complexity of detection tasks, we observe that both
self-training and data-rebalancing suffer from noisy pseudo-labels in SSOD.
Therefore, we propose a novel two-stage filtering algorithm to generate
accurate pseudo-labels. Our method achieves satisfactory improvements on
MS-COCO and VOC benchmarks. When using only 1\% labeled data in MS-COCO, our

opposite chirality with a point contact junction at the origin across which

four-point functions are written down in a closed form in terms of simple
functions of position and time. This allows us to obtain, among other things,
the I-V characteristics for an arbitrary time-dependent bias. Our method is a
superior alternative to competing approaches to non-equilibrium as we are able
to account for transient phenomena as well as the steady state. We study the
approach to steady state by computing the time evolution of the equal-time
one-particle Green function. Our method can be easily applied to the problem of
a double barrier contact whose internal properties can be adjusted to induce
resonant tunneling leading to a conductance maximum. We then consider the case
of a finite bandwidth in the point contact and calculate the non-equilibrium
transport properties which exhibit non-Markovian behaviour. When a subsequently
constant bias is suddenly switched on, the current shows a transient build up
before approaching its steady state value in contrast to the infinite bandwidth
case. This transient property is consistent with numerical simulations of
lattice systems using time-dependent DMRG (tDMRG) suggesting thereby that this
transient build up is merely due to the presence of a short distance cutoff in
the problem description and not on the other details.

data, whose collection can be difficult in many cases. Recently, crowdsourcing
has established itself as an efficient labeling solution through resorting to
non-expert crowds. To reduce the labeling error effects, one common practice is
to distribute each instance to multiple workers, whereas each worker only
annotates a subset of data, resulting in the {\it sparse annotation}
phenomenon. In this paper, we note that when meeting with class-imbalance,
i.e., when the ground truth labels are {\it class-imbalanced}, the sparse
annotations are prone to be skewly distributed, which thus can severely bias
the learning algorithm. To combat this issue, we propose one self-training
based approach named {\it Self-Crowd} by progressively adding confident
pseudo-annotations and rebalancing the annotation distribution. Specifically,
we propose one distribution aware confidence measure to select confident
pseudo-annotations, which adopts the resampling strategy to oversample the
minority annotations and undersample the majority annotations. On one

foundation for the design of structure-preserving accelerated methods. In this

  Prior-invariant Approach Based on Density Ratio Estimation","36 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning from positive and unlabeled (PU) data is an important problem in
various applications. Most of the recent approaches for PU classification
assume that the class-prior (the ratio of positive samples) in the training
unlabeled dataset is identical to that of the test data, which does not hold in
many practical cases. In addition, we usually do not know the class-priors of
the training and test data, thus we have no clue on how to train a classifier
without them. To address these problems, we propose a novel PU classification
method based on density ratio estimation. A notable advantage of our proposed
method is that it does not require the class-priors in the training phase;
class-prior shift is incorporated only in the test phase. We theoretically
justify our proposed method and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness.

leverage the power of AI models for clinical decision support. For medical
images, saliency maps are the most common form of explanation. The maps
highlight important features for AI model's prediction. Although many saliency
map methods have been proposed, it is unknown how well they perform on
explaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each modality/channel
carries distinct clinical meanings of the same underlying biomedical
phenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for
clinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically
important but technically ignored problem, we propose the MSFI
(Modality-Specific Feature Importance) metric to examine whether saliency maps
can highlight modality-specific important features. MSFI encodes the clinical
requirements on modality prioritization and modality-specific feature
localization. Our evaluations on 16 commonly used saliency map methods,
including a clinician user study, show that although most saliency map methods
captured modality importance information in general, most of them failed to
highlight modality-specific important features consistently and precisely. The
evaluation results guide the choices of saliency map methods and provide
insights to propose new ones targeting clinical applications.

overcoming these constraints. Secure slicing avoids resource wastage; however,
DDoS attackers can exploit the sliced network. Therefore, we focused on secure
slicing with resource allocation under massive network traffic. Traffic-aware
scheduling is proposed for secure slicing and resource allocation over
SDN/NFV-enabled 5G networks. In this approach (T-S3RA), user devices are
authenticated using Boolean logic with a password-based key derivation
function. The traffic is scheduled in 5G access points, and secure network

as SliceNet and HopFieldNet, respectively. To predict DDoS attackers, we
computed the Renyi entropy for packet classification. Experiments were
conducted using a network simulator with 250 nodes in the network topology.
Performance was evaluated using metrics such as throughput, latency, packet
transmission ratio, packet loss ratio, slice capacity, bandwidth consumption,
and slice acceptance ratio. T-S3RA was implemented in three 5G use cases with
different requirements including massive machine-type communication,
ultrareliable low-latency communication, and enhanced mobile broadband.

We formulate this rigorously as a function problem, in which we request an

an equivalent promise problem, $\mathsf{GSED}$, in which we ask whether the
ground state energy density is above or below specified thresholds.
  The ground state energy density problem is unusual, in that it concerns a
single, fixed Hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit, whose ground state energy
density is just some fixed, real number. The only input to the computational
problem is the precision to which to estimate this fixed real number,
corresponding to the ground state energy density. Hardness of this problem for
a complexity class therefore implies that the solutions to all problems in the
class are encoded in this single number (analogous to Chaitin's constant in
computability theory).
  This captures computationally the type of question most commonly encountered
in condensed matter physics, which is typically concerned with the physical
properties of a single Hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit. We show that for
classical, translationally invariant, nearest neighbour Hamiltonians on a 2D

regularity and qualitative properties of positive groundstates of $(P_0)$ and
of $(P_\varepsilon)$ with $\varepsilon>0$. We also study the existence of a
compactly supported groundstate for an integral Thomas-Fermi type equation
associated to $(P_\varepsilon)$. In the second part of the paper, for
$\varepsilon\to 0$ we identify six different asymptotic regimes and provide a
characterisation of the limit profiles of the groundstates of $(P_\varepsilon)$
in each of the regimes. We also outline three different asymptotic regimes in
the case $\varepsilon\to\infty$. In one of the asymptotic regimes positive
groundstates of $(P_\varepsilon)$ converge to a compactly supported
Thomas-Fermi limit profile. This is a new and purely nonlocal phenomenon that
can not be observed in the local prototype case of $(P_\varepsilon)$ with
$\alpha=0$. In particular, this provides a justification for the Thomas-Fermi
approximation in astrophysical models of self-gravitating Bose-Einstein
condensate.

method of choice for learning with large over-parameterized models. A popular
theory for explaining why SGD works well in practice is that the algorithm has
an implicit regularization that biases its output towards a good solution.
Perhaps the theoretically most well understood learning setting for SGD is that
of Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO), where it is well known that SGD learns
at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of samples. In this
paper, we consider the problem of SCO and explore the role of implicit
regularization, batch size and multiple epochs for SGD. Our main contributions
are threefold:
  (a) We show that for any regularizer, there is an SCO problem for which
Regularized Empirical Risk Minimzation fails to learn. This automatically rules
out any implicit regularization based explanation for the success of SGD.
  (b) We provide a separation between SGD and learning via Gradient Descent on
empirical loss (GD) in terms of sample complexity. We show that there is an SCO
problem such that GD with any step size and number of iterations can only learn
at a suboptimal rate: at least $\widetilde{\Omega}(1/n^{5/12})$.
  (c) We present a multi-epoch variant of SGD commonly used in practice. We
prove that this algorithm is at least as good as single pass SGD in the worst
case. However, for certain SCO problems, taking multiple passes over the
dataset can significantly outperform single pass SGD.
  We extend our results to the general learning setting by showing a problem
which is learnable for any data distribution, and for this problem, SGD is
strictly better than RERM for any regularization function. We conclude by
discussing the implications of our results for deep learning, and show a
separation between SGD and ERM for two layer diagonal neural networks.

disperse dilute gas-particle multiphase flow is proposed. The gas phase is
always in the hydrodynamic regime. However, the particle phase covers different
flow regimes from particle trajectory crossing to the hydrodynamic wave
interaction with the variation of local particle phase Knudsen number. The
UGKWP is an appropriate method for the capturing of the multiscale transport
mechanism in the particle phase through its coupled wave-particle formulation.
In the regime with intensive particle collision, the evolution of solid
particle will be followed by the analytic wave with quasi-equilibrium
distribution; while in the rarefied regime the non-equilibrium particle phase
will be captured through particle tracking and collision, which plays a
decisive role in recovering particle trajectory crossing behavior. The
gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) is employed for the simulation of gas flow. In the
highly collision regime for the particles, no particles will be sampled in
UGKWP and the wave formulation for solid particle with the hydrodynamic gas
phase will reduce the system to the two-fluid Eulerian model. On the other
hand, in the collisionless regime for the solid particle, the free transport of
solid particle will be followed in UGKWP, and coupled system will return to the
Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for the gas and particle. The scheme will be
tested for in all flow regimes, which include the non-equilibrium particle
trajectory crossing, the particle concentration under different Knudsen number,
and the dispersion of particle flow with the variation of Stokes number. A
experiment of shock-induced particle bed fluidization is simulated and the
results are compared with experimental measurements. These numerical solutions
validate suitability of the proposed scheme for the simulation of gas-particle
multiphase flow.

can be consistently turned into dynamic Einstein-Maxwell fields by promoting
the Lagrangian function to a dynamic scalar field on the tangent bundle of the
configuration space. Accordingly, Einstein-Maxwell theory can be deduced from
the assumption that the motion of elementary test particles in spacetime is

sensors, industry 4.0, internet of things, machine learning and artificial
intelligence in recent years. As a result of the interaction of cyber physical
systems with these concepts, digital twin model has emerged. The concept of
digital twin has been used in many areas with its emergence. The use of this
model has made significant gains, especially in decision making processes. The
gains in decision making processes contribute to every field and cause changes
in terms of cost. In this study, the historical development of the concept of
digital twin has been mentioned and general information about the usage areas
of digital twin has been given. In the light of this information, the cost
effect of the digital twin model, therefore its appearance from the cost
accounting window and its use as a cost reduction method were evaluated. This
study was carried out in order to shed light on the studies with the
insufficient resources in the Turkish literature and the cost accounting
perspective.

space is starting to be constrained. Hospitals and clinics no longer have the
ability to accommodate large numbers of incoming patients. It is clear that the
current state of the health industry needs to improve its valuable and limited
resources. The evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices along with
assistive technologies can alleviate the problem in healthcare, by being a
convenient and easy means of accessing healthcare services wirelessly. There is
a plethora of IoT devices and potential applications that can take advantage of
the unique characteristics that these technologies can offer. However, at the
same time, these services pose novel challenges that need to be properly
addressed. In this article, we review some popular categories of IoT-based
applications for healthcare along with their devices. Then, we describe the
challenges and discuss how research can properly address the open issues and
improve the already existing implementations in healthcare. Further possible
solutions are also discussed to show their potential in being viable solutions
for future healthcare applications

classification, while rare work has been explored in object detection. Some
recent works apply knowledge distillation to constrain the model to retain old
knowledge, but this rigid constraint is detrimental for learning new knowledge.
In our paper, we propose a new scheme for continual learning of object
detection, namely Contrast R-CNN, an approach strikes a balance between
retaining the old knowledge and learning the new knowledge. Furthermore, we
design a Proposal Contrast to eliminate the ambiguity between old and new
instance to make the continual learning more robust. Extensive evaluation on
the PASCAL VOC dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

dark energy (THDE) model with quintessence in a homogeneous and anisotropic
Bianchi type-III (B-III) space-time. We construct the model by using two
conditions (i) expansion scalar ($\theta$) is proportionate to shear scalar
($\sigma$) in the model and (ii) hybrid expansion law $a = t^\beta e^{\gamma
t}$, where $\beta>0$, $\gamma>0$. Our study is based on Type Ia supernovae
(SNIa) data in combination with CMB and BAO observations (Giostri et al, JCAP
3, 27 (2012), arXiv:1203.3213v2[astro-ph.CO]), the present values of Hubble
constant and deceleration parameter are $H_{0} = 73.8$ and $q_{0} = -0.54$
respectively. Compiling our theoretical models with this data, we obtain $\beta
= 2.1445~ \& ~ 2.1154$ for $\gamma = 0.5 ~ \& ~ 1$ respectively. We have
completed a new type of cosmic model for which the expansion occurs to the
current accelerated phase for the restraints. We have discussed the conformity
among the scalar field model of quintessence and THDE model. To understand the
Universe, we have also established the relations for Distance modulus,
Luminosity Distance, and Angular-diameter distance. Some geometric and physical
aspects of the THDE model are also highlighted.

geometrical optics approximation of the vacuum Maxwell's equations, for the
electric field along null geodesics in a general spacetime, relative to an
arbitrary set of instantaneous observers [arXiv:2004.03496]. As one of its
applications, we derive here the final detected intensity signal arising from a
prototypical laser interferometric gravitational wave (GW) Michelson-Morley
detector, comoving with transverse traceless (TT) observers, valid for both
long and short GW wavelengths. One of our main results is the presentation of
the integrated null geodesic parametric equations exchanged between two TT
observers in terms of explicitly observable quantities and the profile of the
plane GW packet. This allows us to revisit the derivation of the consequential
radar distance and Doppler shift, taking the opportunity to discuss some
related subtle conceptual issues and how they might affect the interferometric
process. Another achievement is the calculation of the electric field in each
arm up to the detection event, for any relative orientations of the arms and
the GW direction. The main quantitative result is the new expression for the
final interference pattern, for normal GW incidence, which turns out to have
three contributions: (i) the well-known traditional one due to the difference
in optical paths, and two new ones due to (ii) the Doppler effect, and (iii)
the divergence of the laser beams. The quantitative relevance of the last two
contributions is compared to the traditional one and shown to be negligible
within the geometrical optics regime of light. Although in general further
contributions from the non-parallel transport of the polarization vector are
expected, again in the case of GW normal incidence, such a vector is indeed
parallel transported, and those contributions are absent.

(HSR) on the airline industry, we believe that this research is the first to
examine the substitutability of HSR with Hyperloop services from an operational
point of view. A simulation model is developed to compare the performance of
both these alternate transportation modes for a network of three major cities
in Europe (Amsterdam, Paris, and Frankfurt). Our results indicate that with a
significantly lower pod capacity, the Hyperloop system will still be able to
serve more customers compared to the HSR services, while the vehicle
utilization is observed to be higher in the latter alternative for a given
period of time. In addition, sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the
impact of variation in capsule capacity, number of pods in the system, and
commuter variability. We further compare the two transportation modes with
respect to their estimated infrastructure and operational costs as well as CO2
emission. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted to estimate the
passenger ticket price for Hyperloop services.
