casting process. While conventional human-visual inspection of casting products
is slow and unproductive in mass productions, an automatic and reliable defect
detection not just enhances the quality control process but positively improves
productivity. However, casting defect detection is a challenging task due to
diversity and variation in defects' appearance. Convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have been widely applied in both image classification and defect
detection tasks. Howbeit, CNNs with frequentist inference require a massive
amount of data to train on and still fall short in reporting beneficial
estimates of their predictive uncertainty. Accordingly, leveraging the transfer
learning paradigm, we first apply four powerful CNN-based models (VGG16,
ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2) on a small dataset to extract
meaningful features. Extracted features are then processed by various machine
learning algorithms to perform the classification task. Simulation results
demonstrate that linear support vector machine (SVM) and multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) show the finest performance in defect detection of casting images.
Secondly, to achieve a reliable classification and to measure epistemic
uncertainty, we employ an uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique (ensemble
of MLP models) using features extracted from four pre-trained CNNs. UQ
confusion matrix and uncertainty accuracy metric are also utilized to evaluate
the predictive uncertainty estimates. Comprehensive comparisons reveal that UQ
method based on VGG16 outperforms others to fetch uncertainty. We believe an
uncertainty-aware automatic defect detection solution will reinforce casting
productions quality assurance.

whose largest eigenvalue is directly linked to the minimum Q factor. Our
results allow also to determine in closed form the corresponding optimal

orthogonal reflection symmetries the minimum Q factor can be simply obtained
from the Q factors of the single current modes with non-vanishing dipole

show the presence of tunable exceptional points of various orders in

exceptional points in higher number of variables and demonstrate that it can
reveal rich anisotropic behaviour around such degeneracies. Our work provides

time-consuming due to a noticeable number of matrix operations performed on the
huge-size block Hankel-like matrix. In this work, we proposed a novel framework
to utilize the low-rank property but meanwhile to achieve faster
reconstructions and promising results. The framework allows us to enforce the
low-rankness of Hankel matrices constructing from 1D vectors instead of 2D
matrices from 1D vectors and thus avoid the construction of huge block Hankel
matrix for 2D k-space matrices. Moreover, under this framework, we can easily
incorporate other information, such as the smooth phase of the image and the
low-rankness in the parameter dimension, to further improve the image quality.
We built and validated two models for parallel and parameter magnetic resonance
imaging experiments, respectively. Our retrospective in-vivo results indicate
that the proposed approaches enable faster reconstructions than the

flare energy budget. Two mechanisms play an important role for continuum
emission in flares: hydrogen recombination after sudden ionization at
chromospheric layers and transportation of the energy radiatively from the
chromosphere to lower layers in the atmosphere, the so called back-warming. The
aim of the paper is to disentangle between these two mechanisms for the excess
of Balmer continuum observed in a flare. Methods. We combine the observations
of Balmer continuum obtained with IRIS (spectra and SJIs 2832 A) and hard X-ray
(HXR) emission detected by FERMI Gamma Burst Monitor (GBM) during a mini flare.
Calibrated Balmer continuum is compared to non-LTE radiative transfer flare
models and radiated energy is estimated. Assuming thick target HXR emission, we
calculate the energy of non-thermal electrons detected by FERMI GBM and compare
it to the radiated energy. The favorable argument of a relationship between the
Balmer continuum excess and the HXR emission is that there is a good time
coincidence between both of them. In addition, the shape of the maximum
brightness in the 2832 SJIs, which is mainly due to this Balmer continuum
excess, is similar to the FERMI/GBM light curve. The electron-beam flux
estimated from FERMI/GBM is consistent with the beam flux required in non-LTE
radiative transfer models to get the excess of Balmer continuum emission
observed in the IRIS spectra. The low energy input by non thermal electrons
above 20 keV is sufficient to produce the enhancement of Balmer continuum
emission. This could be explained by the topology of the reconnection site. The
reconnection starts in a tiny bald patch region which is transformed
dynamically in a X-point current sheet. The size of the interacting region
would be under the spatial resolution of the instrument.

neglects the typically expected presence of additional degrees of freedom on

universes have established beyond doubt the existence of a significant amount
of short-wavelength propagation modes (commonly called wiggles) on the strings,

applications and have been studied by researchers in the context of experiments

numbers, and this leads to significant/intractable space-time resolution
requirements for DNS or LES modeling. On the other hand, many of the important
physical mechanisms in these systems, such as stress anisotropy, wake
stabilization, and regime transition, inherently render eddy viscosity-based
RANS modeling inappropriate. Accordingly, we pursue second-moment closure
(SMC), i.e., full Reynolds stress/flux/variance modeling, for moderate Reynolds
number non-stratified and stratified shear layers for which DNS is possible. A
range of sub-model complexity is pursued for the diffusion of stresses, density
fluxes and variance, pressure strain and scrambling, and dissipation. These
sub-models are evaluated in terms of how well they are represented by DNS in
comparison to the exact Reynolds averaged terms, and how well they impact the
accuracy of the full RANS closure. For the non-stratified case, the SMC model
predicts the shear layer growth rate and Reynolds shear stress profiles
accurately. Stress anisotropy and budgets are captured only qualitatively.
Comparing DNS of exact and modeled terms, inconsistencies in model performance
and assumptions are observed, including inaccurate prediction of individual
statistics, non-negligible pressure diffusion, and dissipation anisotropy. For
the stratified case, shear layer and gradient Richardson number growth rates,
and stress, flux, and variance decay rates, are captured with less accuracy
than corresponding flow parameters in the non-stratified case. These studies
lead to several recommendations for model improvement.

including drug response and symptoms, all of which are highly important when
predicting key outcomes in acute care patients. We propose the automatic
annotation of phenotypes from clinical notes as a method to capture essential
information, which is complementary to typically used vital signs and
laboratory test results, to predict outcomes in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
  Methods: We develop a novel phenotype annotation model to annotate phenotypic
features of patients which are then used as input features of predictive models
to predict ICU patient outcomes. We demonstrate and validate our approach
conducting experiments on three ICU prediction tasks including in-hospital
mortality, physiological decompensation and length of stay for over 24,000
patients by using MIMIC-III dataset.
  Results: The predictive models incorporating phenotypic information achieve
0.845 (AUC-ROC) to predict in-hospital mortality, 0.839 (AUC-ROC) for
physiological decompensation and 0.430 (Kappa) for length of stay, all of which
consistently outperform the baseline models leveraging only vital signs and
laboratory test results. Moreover, we conduct a thorough interpretability
study, showing that phenotypes provide valuable insights at the patient and
cohort levels.
  Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates phenotypic information
complements traditionally used vital signs and laboratory test results,
improving significantly forecast of outcomes in the ICU.

generation for wearable devices that leverages the wearer's respiration
activity to ensure that the devices are part of the same body-area network. We
assume that the devices exploit different types of sensors to extract and
process the respiration signal. We illustrate B2P for the case of two devices
that use respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) and accelerometer
sensors, respectively. Allowing for different types of sensors in pairing
allows us to include wearable devices that use a variety of different sensors.
In practice, this form of sensor variety creates a number of challenges that
limit the ability of the shared-key establishment algorithm to generate
matching keys. The two main obstacles are the lack of synchronization across
the devices and the need for correct noise-induced mismatches between the
generated key bit-strings.
  B2P addresses the synchronization challenge by utilizing Change Point
Detection (CPD) to detect abrupt changes in the respiration signal and consider
their occurrences as synchronizing points. Any potential mismatches are handled
by optimal quantization and encoding of the respiration signal in order to
maximize the error correction rate and minimize the message overheads.
Extensive evaluation on a dataset collected from 30 volunteers demonstrates
that our protocol can generate a secure 256-bit key every 2.85 seconds (around
one breathing cycle). Particular attention is given to secure B2P against

a broad wavelength range and system compactness, which are difficult to achieve
by conventional imaging sensors. However, a common challenge is low image
quality arising from undersampling. Deep learning (DL) is an emerging and
powerful tool in computational imaging for many applications and researchers
have applied DL in SPI to achieve higher image quality than conventional
reconstruction approaches. One outstanding challenge, however, is that the
accuracy of DL predictions in SPI cannot be assessed in practical applications
where the ground truths are unknown. Here, we propose the use of the Bayesian
convolutional neural network (BCNN) to approximate the uncertainty (coming from
finite training data and network model) of the DL predictions in SPI. Each
pixel in the predicted result from BCNN represents the parameter of a
probability distribution rather than the image intensity value. Then, the
uncertainty can be approximated with BCNN by minimizing a negative
log-likelihood loss function in the training stage and Monte Carlo dropout in
the prediction stage. The results show that the BCNN can reliably approximate
the uncertainty of the DL predictions in SPI with varying compression ratios
and noise levels. The predicted uncertainty from BCNN in SPI reveals that most
of the reconstruction errors in deep-learning-based SPI come from the edges of
the image features. The results show that the proposed BCNN can provide a
reliable tool to approximate the uncertainty of DL predictions in SPI and can
be widely used in many applications of SPI.

designing a quantum Hoare logic for verifying parameterized recursive quantum

Standard renewal or master equation approach are typically used to study steady
state and other transport properties such as average, mean squared displacement
etc. What remains less explored is the two time point correlation functions
whose evaluation is often daunting since it requires the implementation of the
exact time dependent probability density functions of the resetting processes
which are unknown for most of the problems. We adopt a different approach that
allows us to write a stochastic solution in the level of a single trajectory
undergoing resetting. Moments and the autocorrelation functions between any two
times along the trajectory can then be computed directly using the laws of
total expectation. Estimation of autocorrelation functions turns out to be
pivotal for investigating the ergodic properties of various observables for
this canonical model. In particular, we investigate two observables (i) sample
mean which is widely used in economics and (ii)
time-averaged-mean-squared-displacement (TAMSD) which is of acute interest in
physics. We find that both diffusion and drift-diffusion processes are ergodic
at the mean level unlike their reset-free counterparts. In contrast, resetting
renders ergodicity breaking in the TAMSD while both the stochastic processes
are ergodic when resetting is absent. We quantify these behaviors with detailed
analytical study and corroborate with extensive numerical simulations. The
current study provides an important baseline that unifies two different
approaches, used ubiquitously in economics and physics, for studying the
ergodic properties in diffusion with resetting. We believe that our results can
be verified in single particle experimental set-ups and thus have strong
implications in the field of resetting.

makes three contributions: 1. We examined this connection by comparing MAIC and
a few commonly used calibration estimation methods, including the entropy
balancing approach, which is equivalent to MAIC. 2. We considered the standard

for the classification of mammogram images can help in improving the accuracy,

to obtain as time and effort from clinical practitioners is required. A number
of publicly available datasets have been built with data from different
hospitals and clinics. However, using models trained on these datasets for
later work on images sampled from a different hospital or clinic might result
in lower performance. This is due to the distribution mismatch of the datasets,
which include different patient populations and image acquisition protocols.
The scarcity of labeled data can also bring a challenge towards the application
of transfer learning with models trained using these source datasets. In this
work, a real world scenario is evaluated where a novel target dataset sampled
from a private Costa Rican clinic is used, with few labels and heavily
imbalanced data. The use of two popular and publicly available datasets
(INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) as source data, to train and test the models on the
novel target dataset, is evaluated. The use of the semi-supervised deep
learning approach known as MixMatch, to leverage the usage of unlabeled data
from the target dataset, is proposed and evaluated. In the tests, the
performance of models is extensively measured, using different metrics to
assess the performance of a classifier under heavy data imbalance conditions.
It is shown that the use of semi-supervised deep learning combined with

user activities - one such activity is to artificially bolster the social
reputation of Twitter profiles by gaining a large number of followers within a
short time span. Many users want to gain followers to increase the visibility
and reach of their profiles to wide audiences. This has provoked several
blackmarket services to garner huge attention by providing artificial followers
via the network of agreeable and compromised accounts in a collusive manner.
Their activity is difficult to detect as the blackmarket services shape their
behavior in such a way that users who are part of these services disguise
themselves as genuine users.
  In this paper, we propose DECIFE, a framework to detect collusive users
involved in producing 'following' activities through blackmarket services with
the intention to gain collusive followers in return. We first construct a
heterogeneous user-tweet-topic network to leverage the follower/followee
relationships and linguistic properties of a user. The heterogeneous network is
then decomposed to form four different subgraphs that capture the semantic
relations between the users. An attention-based subgraph aggregation network is
proposed to learn and combine the node representations from each subgraph. The
combined representation is finally passed on to a hypersphere learning
objective to detect collusive users. Comprehensive experiments on our curated
dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of DECIFE by comparing it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to detect collusive users involved in blackmarket 'following services'

in the literature using linear stability analysis. Then we solve this
generalized model numerically using a spectrally accurate boundary integral
method in an evolving annular domain, not only with a Robin boundary condition
on the outer boundary for the nutrient field which models tumor vasculature,
but also with a static boundary condition on the inner boundary for pressure
field which models the control of tumor necrosis. The discretized linear
systems for both pressure and nutrient fields are shown to be well-conditioned
through tracing GMRES iteration numbers. Our nonlinear simulations reveal the
stabilizing effects of angiogenesis and the destabilizing ones of chemotaxis
and necrosis in the development of tumor morphological instabilities if the
necrotic core is fixed in a circular shape. When the necrotic core is
controlled in a non-circular shape, the stabilizing effects of proliferation
and the destabilizing ones of apoptosis are observed. Finally, the values of
the nutrient concentration with its fluxes and the pressure level with its
normal derivatives, which are solved accurately at the boundaries, help us to
characterize the corresponding tumor morphology and the level of the
biophysical quantities on interfaces required in keeping various shapes of the
necrotic region of the tumor. Interestingly, we notice that when the necrotic
region is fixed in a 3-fold non-circular shape, even if the initial shape of
the tumor is circular, the tumor will evolve into a shape corresponding to the
3-fold symmetry of the shape of the fixed necrotic region.

populations migrate chemotactically along self-generated chemical gradients,
often forming a propagating front. Here, we theoretically show that the
stability of such chemotactic fronts to morphological perturbations is
determined by limitations in the ability of individual cells to sense and
thereby respond to the chemical gradient. Specifically, cells at bulging parts
of a front are exposed to a smaller gradient, which slows them down and
promotes stability, but they also respond more strongly to the gradient, which
speeds them up and promotes instability. We predict that this competition leads
to chemotactic fingering when sensing is limited at too low chemical
concentrations. Guided by this finding and by experimental data on E. coli
chemotaxis, we suggest that the cells' sensory machinery might have evolved to
avoid these limitations and ensure stable front propagation. Finally, as
sensing of any stimuli is necessarily limited in living and active matter in
general, the principle of sensing-induced stability may operate in other types
of directed migration such as durotaxis, electrotaxis, and phototaxis.

humanoid robots. This paper proposes a novel external balance mechanism for
humanoid robot to maintain sideway balance. First, a dynamic model of the
humanoid robot with balance mechanism and its simplified model are introduced.
Secondly, a backstepping-based control method is utilized to split the system
into two sub-systems. Then, a minimum observer-based controller is used to
control the first sub-system. Since the second sub-system has unknown
parameters, a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) is used to control it.
The proposed design divides the walking and balancing into two separated tasks,
allowing the walking control can be executed independently of the balancing
control. Furthermore, the use of the balance mechanism ensures the humanoid
robot's hip movement does not exceed the threshold of a human when walking.
Thus, making the overall pose of the humanoid robot looks more natural. An
experiment is carried out on a commercial humanoid robot known as UXA-90 to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

where the events are generally sparse and non-uniform and have the microsecond

Spiking neural network (SNN), as one of the brain-inspired event-triggered
computing models, has the potential to extract effective spatio-temporal
features from the event streams. However, when aggregating individual events
into frames with a new higher temporal resolution, existing SNN models do not
attach importance to that the serial frames have different signal-to-noise
ratios since event streams are sparse and non-uniform. This situation
interferes with the performance of existing SNNs. In this work, we propose a
temporal-wise attention SNN (TA-SNN) model to learn frame-based representation
for processing event streams. Concretely, we extend the attention concept to
temporal-wise input to judge the significance of frames for the final decision
at the training stage, and discard the irrelevant frames at the inference
stage. We demonstrate that TA-SNN models improve the accuracy of event streams
classification tasks. We also study the impact of multiple-scale temporal
resolutions for frame-based representation. Our approach is tested on three
different classification tasks: gesture recognition, image classification, and
spoken digit recognition. We report the state-of-the-art results on these
tasks, and get the essential improvement of accuracy (almost 19\%) for gesture
recognition with only 60 ms.

from rare values of the attractive and repulsive exponents $(\alpha,\beta)$,
the energy minimizing configurations of particles are not explicitly known,
although simulations and local stability considerations have led to conjectures
with strong evidence over a much wider region of parameters. For a segment
$\beta =2<\alpha<4$ on the mildly repulsive frontier we employ strict convexity
to conclude that the energy is uniquely minimized (up to translation) by a
spherical shell. In a companion work, we show that in the mildly repulsive
range $\alpha>\beta \ge2$, a unimodal threshold $2<\alpha_{\Delta^n}(\beta) \le
\max\{\beta,4\}$ exists such that equidistribution of particles over a unit
diameter regular $n$-simplex minimizes the energy if and only if $\alpha \ge

establishes $d_\alpha$-Lyapunov nonlinear stability of the associated

$L^\alpha$-Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance $d_\alpha$ which quantifies

To address it, current methods either deploy pose-specific models or frontalize
faces by additional modules. Still, they ignore the fact that identity

imbalance between frontal and profile face images during training. In this

in unknown and unstructured environments is determining where the robot can or
cannot safely move. A significant source of difficulty in this determination
arises from stochasticity and uncertainty, coming from localization error,
sensor sparsity and noise, difficult-to-model robot-ground interactions, and
disturbances to the motion of the vehicle. Classical approaches to this problem
rely on geometric analysis of the surrounding terrain, which can be prone to
modeling errors and can be computationally expensive. Moreover, modeling the
distribution of uncertain traversability costs is a difficult task, compounded
by the various error sources mentioned above. In this work, we take a
principled learning approach to this problem. We introduce a neural network
architecture for robustly learning the distribution of traversability costs.
Because we are motivated by preserving the life of the robot, we tackle this
learning problem from the perspective of learning tail-risks, i.e. the
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We show that this approach reliably learns
the expected tail risk given a desired probability risk threshold between 0 and
1, producing a traversability costmap which is more robust to outliers, more
accurately captures tail risks, and is more computationally efficient, when
compared against baselines. We validate our method on data collected a legged
robot navigating challenging, unstructured environments including an abandoned
subway, limestone caves, and lava tube caves.

similarity for the inviscid steady irrotational Euler flow over a
two-dimensional Lipschitz slender wedge in $BV\cap L^1$ space. The rate we
established is the same as the one predicted by Newtonian-Busemann law (see
(3.29) in \cite[Page 67]{anderson} for more details)as the incoming Mach number
$\textrm{M}_{\infty}\rightarrow\infty$ for a fixed hypersonic similarity
parameter $K$. The hypersonic similarity, which is also called the Mach-number
independence principle, is equivalent to the following Van Dyke's similarity
theory: For a given hypersonic similarity parameter $K$, when the Mach number
of the flow is sufficiently large, the governing equations after the scaling
are approximated by a simpler equation, that is called the hypersonic
small-disturbance equation. To achieve the convergence rate, we approximate the
curved boundary by piecewisely straight lines and find a new Lipschitz
continuous map $\mathcal{P}_{h}$ such that the trajectory can be obtained by
piecing together the Riemann solutions near the approximated boundary. Next, we
derive the $L^1$ difference estimates between the approximate solutions
$U^{(\tau)}_{h,\nu}(x,\cdot)$ to the initial-boundary value problem for the
scaled equations and the trajectories $\mathcal{P}_{h}(x,0)(U^{\nu}_{0})$ by
piecing together all the Riemann solvers. Then, by the uniqueness and the

establish the $L^1$ estimates of order $\tau^2$ between the solutions to the

Learning systems, where fairness serves as an incentive mechanism that
encourages more workers to participate in the federation. Considering the
achieved training accuracy of the global model as the utility of the selected
workers, which is typically a monotone submodular function, we formulate the
worker selection problem as a new multi-round monotone submodular maximization
problem with cardinality and fairness constraints. The objective is to maximize
the time-average utility over multiple rounds subject to an additional fairness
requirement that each worker must be selected for a certain fraction of time.
While the traditional submodular maximization with a cardinality constraint is
already a well-known NP-Hard problem, the fairness constraint in the
multi-round setting adds an extra layer of difficulty. To address this novel
challenge, we propose three algorithms: Fair Continuous Greedy (FairCG1 and
FairCG2) and Fair Discrete Greedy (FairDG), all of which satisfy the fairness
requirement whenever feasible. Moreover, we prove nontrivial lower bounds on
the achieved time-average utility under FairCG1 and FairCG2. In addition, by
giving a higher priority to fairness, FairDG ensures a stronger short-term
fairness guarantee, which holds in every round. Finally, we perform extensive
simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of
the time-average utility and fairness satisfaction.

the evolution of hierarchical black holes within dense stellar clusters. By
reducing the spin of individual black holes, superradiance reduce the recoil
velocity of merging binary black holes, which, in turn, increases the retention
fraction of hierarchical merger remnants. We show that the existence of
ultralight bosons with mass $ 2\times10^{-14}\lesssim \mu/\textrm{eV}
\lesssim2\times10^{-13}$ would lead to an increased rate of hierarchical black
hole mergers in nuclear star clusters. An ultralight boson in this energy range
would result in up to $\approx60\%$ more present-day nuclear star clusters
supporting hierarchical growth. The presence of an ultralight boson can also
double the rate of intermediate mass black hole mergers to
$\approx0.08$\,Gpc$^{-3}$\,yr$^{-1}$ in the local Universe. These results imply
that a select range of ultralight boson mass can have far-reaching consequences

and multiple agents in a wireless network. The objective is to minimize a
global function that is a sum of the agents' local loss functions. And the
optimization is conducted by analog over-the-air model training. Specifically,
each agent modulates its local gradient onto a set of waveforms and transmits
to the edge server simultaneously. From the received analog signal the edge
server extracts a noisy aggregated gradient which is distorted by the channel
fading and interference, and uses it to update the global model and feedbacks
to all the agents for another round of local computing. Since the
electromagnetic interference generally exhibits a heavy-tailed intrinsic, we
use the $\alpha$-stable distribution to model its statistic. In consequence,
the global gradient has an infinite variance that hinders the use of
conventional techniques for convergence analysis that rely on second-order
moments' existence. To circumvent this challenge, we take a new route to
establish the analysis of convergence rate, as well as generalization error, of
the algorithm. Our analyses reveal a two-sided effect of the interference on
the overall training procedure. On the negative side, heavy tail noise slows
down the convergence rate of the model training: the heavier the tail in the
distribution of interference, the slower the algorithm converges. On the
positive side, heavy tail noise has the potential to increase the
generalization power of the trained model: the heavier the tail, the better the
model generalizes. This perhaps counterintuitive conclusion implies that the
prevailing thinking on interference -- that it is only detrimental to the edge
learning system -- is outdated and we shall seek new techniques that exploit,

CRs can also contribute to heating the gas deep within molecular clouds, and
their effect can be substantial in environments where CRs are abundant. CRs
propagate predominantly by diffusion in media with disordered magnetic fields.
The complex magnetic structures in molecular clouds therefore determine the
propagation and spatial distribution of CRs within them, and hence regulate
their local ionization and heating patterns.
  Optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarization of starlight through molecular
clouds is often used to trace magnetic fields. The coefficients of CR diffusion
in magnetized molecular cloud complexes can be inferred from the observed

research interest in both academia and industry. To support aerial user

assign a portion of the system bandwidth exclusively to the UAV-UEs. This is
especially favorable for use cases where a large number of UAV-UEs are
exploited, e.g., for package delivery close to a warehouse. Although the nearly
line-of-sight (LoS) channels can result in higher powers received, UAVs can in
turn cause severe interference to each other in the same frequency band. In
this contribution, we focus on the uplink communications of massive
cellular-connected UAVs. Different power allocation algorithms are proposed to
either maximize the minimal spectrum efficiency (SE) or maximize the overall SE
to cope with severe interference based on the successive convex approximation
(SCA) principle. One of the challenges is that a UAV can affect a large area
meaning that many more UAV-UEs must be considered in the optimization problem,
which is essentially different from that for terrestrial UEs. The necessity of
single-carrier uplink transmission further complicates the problem.
Nevertheless, we find that the special property of large coherent bandwidths
and coherent times of the propagation channels can be leveraged. The
performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated via extensive simulations
in the full-buffer transmission mode and bursty-traffic mode. Results show that
the proposed algorithms can effectively enhance the uplink SEs. This work can

We demonstrate the crucial importance of magnetic interactions beyond the
first-neighbour to qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce the experimental
results. Once we ascertain the predictive capacity of the model for chromium
trihalides and CrGeTe$_3$, we investigate the feasibility of tuning the
magnetic ordering by electrical means in these materials. A remarkable
five-fold increase in the ferromagnetic Curie temperature is predicted in
monolayer CrI$_3$ within experimentally obtainable hole density. The elusive
microscopic mechanism behind the doping-dependent Curie temperature is
illustrated. Further, in the present context, the effects of biaxial strain and

how to control a complex social network, where members share their opinions and
influence one another. Previous works in this area have focused on
controllability, energy cost, or optimization under the assumption that all
nodes are compliant, passing on information neutrally without any preferences.
However, the assumption on nodal neutrality should be reassessed, given that in
networked social systems, some people may hold fast to their personal beliefs.
By introducing some stubborn agents, or zealots, who hold steadfast to their
beliefs and seek to influence others, the control energy is computed and
compared against those without zealots. It was found that the presence of
zealots alters the energy cost at a quadratic rate with respect to their own
fixed beliefs. However, whether or not the zealots' presence increases or
decreases the energy cost is affected by the interplay between different
parameters such as the zealots' beliefs, number of drivers, final control time
regimes, network effects, network dynamics, and number and configurations of
neutral nodes influenced by the zealots. For example, when a network dynamics
is linear but does not have conformity behavior, it could be possible for a
contrarian zealot to assist in reducing control energy. With conformity
behavior, a contrarian zealot always negatively affects network control by
increasing energy cost. The results of this paper suggest caution when modeling
real networked social systems with the controllability of networked linear
dynamics since the system dynamical behavior is sensitive to parameter change.

emerging SNN supervised learning algorithm inspired by backpropagation through
time (BPTT) from the domain of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has
successfully boosted the accuracy of SNNs and helped improve the practicability
of SNNs. However, current general-purpose processors suffer from low efficiency
when performing BPTT for SNNs due to the ANN-tailored optimization. On the

adopt local synaptic plasticity rules for simplified implementation.
  In this work, we propose H2Learn, a novel architecture that can achieve high
efficiency for BPTT-based SNN learning which ensures high accuracy of SNNs. At
the beginning, we characterized the behaviors of BPTT-based SNN learning.
Benefited from the binary spike-based computation in the forward pass and the
weight update, we first design lookup table (LUT) based processing elements in
Forward Engine and Weight Update Engine to make accumulations implicit and to
fuse the computations of multiple input points. Second, benefited from the rich
sparsity in the backward pass, we design a dual-sparsity-aware Backward Engine
which exploits both input and output sparsity. Finally, we apply a pipeline
optimization between different engines to build an end-to-end solution for the
BPTT-based SNN learning. Compared with the modern NVIDIA V100 GPU, H2Learn
achieves 7.38x area saving, 5.74-10.20x speedup, and 5.25-7.12x energy saving

application in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). One source of
uncertainty arises from distribution shifts in the input data between training

emerging approach to address the challenge. The high dimensional input space in
CPS applications involving imaging adds extra difficulty to the task.
Generative learning models are widely adopted for the task, namely
out-of-distribution (OoD) detection. To improve the state-of-the-art, we
studied existing proposals from both machine learning and CPS fields. In the
latter, safety monitoring in real-time for autonomous driving agents has been a
focus. Exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of motion in videos, we can
robustly detect hazardous motion around autonomous driving agents. Inspired by
the latest advances in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) theory and practice,
we tapped into the prior knowledge in data to further boost OoD detection's
robustness. Comparison studies over nuScenes and Synthia data sets show our
methods significantly improve detection capabilities of OoD factors unique to
driving scenarios, 42% better than state-of-the-art approaches. Our model also
generalized near-perfectly, 97% better than the state-of-the-art across the

customized one proposed method into a twin-encoder model that can be deployed
to resource limited embedded devices for real-time OoD detection. Its execution
time was reduced over four times in low-precision 8-bit integer inference,
while detection capability is comparable to its corresponding floating-point

proved to be elusive, and not many of them have been found since the first one

an idf-domain (i.e., every nonzero element is divisible by only finitely many
irreducibles up to associates). We prove that a ring is an FFD if and only if

neither being atomic nor being an idf-domain transfer, in general, from an

properties in a two dimensional molecular crystal of cyclacenes, using density
functional theory (DFT). Isolated cyclacenes with an even number of fused
benzenes host two unpaired electrons in two topological protected zero modes,
at the top and bottom carbon rings that form the molecule. We show that, in the
gas phase, electron repulsion promotes an open-shell singlet with strong
intramolecular antiferromagnetic exchange. We consider a closed packing
triangular lattice crystal phase and we find a strong dependence of the band
structure and magnetic interactions on the rotation angle of the cyclacenes
with respect to the crystal lattice vectors. The orientational ground state
maximizes the intermolecular hybridization, yet local moments survive.
Intermolecular exchange is computed to be antiferromagnetic, and DFT predicts a
broken symmetry $120^\circ$ spin phase reflecting the frustration of the
intermolecular spin coupling. Thus, the cyclacene crystal realizes a bilayer of
two antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/2 triangular lattices. Our results
provide a bottom-up route towards carbon based strongly correlated platforms in
two dimensions.

numerically addresses the problem of dispatch of virtual inertia and damping
(DID) among inverters in the transmission network. The DID problem is first
formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP) by the Radua collocation method which
is flexible to handle various types of disturbances and bounds constraints.
Since the NLP of DID is highly non-convex, semi-definite programming (SDP)
relaxation for the NLP is further derived to tackle the non-convexity, followed
by its sparsity being exploited hierarchically based on chordality of graphs to
seek enhancement of computational efficiency. Considering high dimension and
inexactness of the SDP relaxation, a feasibility-embedded distributed approach
is finally proposed under the framework of alternating direction method of

an absolutely continuous distribution with respect to the Lebesgue measure that
is symmetric around zero, unimodal and with finite moments up to fourth-order.
Second, we allow the conditional distribution to follow a dispersion model

multivariate framework where multiple responses are combined by imposing a
multivariate absolute continuous distribution on the random components
representing common clusters of observations in all the marginal models.
  Maximum likelihood inference in these models involves evaluating an integral
that often cannot be computed in closed form. We suggest an inference method
that predicts values of random components and does not involve the integration

TGF-$\beta$/SMAD signaling encodes various cell fates, controls tissue

strong heterogeneity at the single-cell level, but quantitative insights into
mechanisms underlying fluctuations at various time scales are still missing,
partly due to inefficiency in the calibration of stochastic models that
mechanistically describe signaling processes. In this work we analyze
single-cell TGF-$\beta$/SMAD signaling and show that it exhibits temporal
stochastic bursts which are dose-dependent and whose number and magnitude
correlate with cell migration. We propose a stochastic modeling approach to
mechanistically describe these pathway fluctuations with high computational
efficiency. Employing high-order numerical integration and fitting to burst
statistics we enable efficient quantitative parameter estimation and
discriminate models that assume noise in different reactions at the receptor
level. This modeling approach suggests that stochasticity in the
internalization of TGF-$\beta$ receptors into endosomes plays a key role in the
observed temporal bursting. Further, the model predicts the single-cell
dynamics of TGF-$\beta$/SMAD signaling in untested conditions, e.g.,
successfully reflects memory effects of signaling noise and cellular
sensitivity towards repeated stimulation. Taken together, our computational
framework based on burst analysis, noise modeling and path computation scheme
is a suitable tool for the data-based modeling of complex signaling pathways,

ultraviolet spectral lines from the Fe X ion can be used to measure the solar
coronal magnetic field based on the magnetic-field-inducedtransition (MIT)
theory. To verify the suitability of this method, we performed forward
modelingwith a three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic model of a solar
active region. Intensities of several spectral lines from Fe X were synthesized
from the model. Based on the MIT theory, intensity ratios of the MIT line Fe X
257 A to several other Fe X lines were used to derive the magnetic field
strengths, which were then compared with the field strengths in the model. We
also developed a new method to simultaneously estimate the coronal density and
temperature from the Fe X 174/175 and 184/345 A line ratios. Using these
estimates, we demonstrated that the MIT technique can provide reasonably
accurate measurements of the coronal magnetic field in both on-disk and
off-limb solar observations. Our investigation suggests that a spectrometer
that can simultaneously observe the Fe X 174, 175, 184, 257, and 345 A lines
and allow an accurate radiometric calibration for these lines is highly desired

evaluation of tissues during surgical operations. The high speed of the
procedure allows pathologists to rapidly assess the key microscopic features,
such as tumour margins and malignant status to guide surgical decision-making
and minimise disruptions to the course of the operation. However, FS is prone
to introducing many misleading artificial structures (histological artefacts),
such as nuclear ice crystals, compression, and cutting artefacts, hindering
timely and accurate diagnostic judgement of the pathologist. Additional
training and prolonged experience is often required to make highly effective
and time-critical diagnosis on frozen sections. On the other hand, the gold
standard tissue preparation technique of formalin-fixation and
paraffin-embedding (FFPE) provides significantly superior image quality, but is
a very time-consuming process (12-48 hours), making it unsuitable for
intra-operative use. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)
method that improves FS image quality by computationally transforming
frozen-sectioned whole-slide images (FS-WSIs) into whole-slide FFPE-style
images in minutes. AI-FFPE rectifies FS artefacts with the guidance of an
attention mechanism that puts a particular emphasis on artefacts while
utilising a self-regularization mechanism established between FS input image
and synthesized FFPE-style image that preserves clinically relevant features.
As a result, AI-FFPE method successfully generates FFPE-style images without
significantly extending tissue processing time and consequently improves
diagnostic accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of AI-FFPE on lung and brain
frozen sections using a variety of different qualitative and quantitative
metrics including visual Turing tests from 20 board certified pathologists.

pre-trained models to produce coarse saliency maps to guide the generation of
pseudo segmentation labels. However, the commonly used off-line heuristic
generation process cannot fully exploit the benefits of these coarse saliency
maps. Motivated by the significant inter-task correlation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised multi-task framework termed as AuxSegNet, to leverage
saliency detection and multi-label image classification as auxiliary tasks to
improve the primary task of semantic segmentation using only image-level
ground-truth labels. Inspired by their similar structured semantics, we also
propose to learn a cross-task global pixel-level affinity map from the saliency
and segmentation representations. The learned cross-task affinity can be used
to refine saliency predictions and propagate CAM maps to provide improved
pseudo labels for both tasks. The mutual boost between pseudo label updating
and cross-task affinity learning enables iterative improvements on segmentation
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed auxiliary learning network structure and the cross-task affinity
learning method. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art weakly

GNNs gain their performance benefits mainly from performing the feature
propagation and smoothing across the edges of the graph, thus requiring
sufficient connectivity and label information for effective propagation.
Unfortunately, many real-world networks are sparse in terms of both edges and
labels, leading to sub-optimal performance of GNNs. Recent interest in this
sparse problem has focused on the self-training approach, which expands
supervised signals with pseudo labels. Nevertheless, the self-training approach
inherently cannot realize the full potential of refining the learning
performance on sparse graphs due to the unsatisfactory quality and quantity of
pseudo labels.
  In this paper, we propose ROD, a novel reception-aware online knowledge
distillation approach for sparse graph learning. We design three supervision
signals for ROD: multi-scale reception-aware graph knowledge, task-based
supervision, and rich distilled knowledge, allowing online knowledge transfer
in a peer-teaching manner. To extract knowledge concealed in the multi-scale
reception fields, ROD explicitly requires individual student models to preserve
different levels of locality information. For a given task, each student would
predict based on its reception-scale knowledge, while simultaneously a strong
teacher is established on-the-fly by combining multi-scale knowledge. Our
approach has been extensively evaluated on 9 datasets and a variety of
graph-based tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and node

gravitationally lensed quasar Q 0957+561 with relatively high signal-to-noise
ratios (at the adequate wavelength). Based on the statistics of microlensing
magnifications, we used a Bayesian method to derive the size of its emitting

epochs of observation by a value of 17 angstroms on average. We find clear
differences in the shape of the Fe III line blend between images A and B.
Measuring the strength of those magnitude differences, we conclude that this
blend may arise from a region of half-light radius of 15 lt-days, which is in
good agreement with the accretion disk dimensions for this system. We obtain a
mass for the central SMBH of (1.5 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 solar masses, consistent
within uncertainties with previous mass estimates based on the virial theorem.
The relatively small uncertainties in the mass determination (< 35%) make this

Combining the Fe III redshift-based method with the virial, we estimate a

an appropriate hypothesis of fully developed chaos. The equivalence of these
motion descriptions allows to show that kinetic and thermal energy cascade
arise both from the convective term of Liouville equation. Accordingly, these
phenomena, of nondiffusive nature, correspond to a transport in physical space
linked to the trajectories divergence. Both the bifurcation rates are properly
defined, where the kinematic bifurcation rate is shown to be much greater than
Navier--Stokes bifurcation rate. This justifies the proposed hypothesis of
fully developed chaos where velocity field and particles trajectories
fluctuations are statistically uncorrelated. Thereafter, a specific ergodic
property is presented, which relates the statistics of fluid displacement to
that of velocity and temperature fields. A detailed analysis of separation rate
is proposed which studies the statistics of radial velocity component along the
material separation vector. Based on previous elements, the closure formulas of

closures, of nondiffusive kind, represent a propagation phenomenon, and

different experimental conditions. Here we introduce a framework which
calculates the fastest possible pulsed sideband cooling sequence for a given

improvement compared to traditional methods using a trapped $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ion.
After extensive cooling, we find that the ion motional distribution is
distinctly non-thermal and thus not amenable to standard thermometry

to measure ion temperatures after sideband cooling. These techniques will
enable more efficient cooling and thermometry within trapped-ion systems,
especially those with high initial temperatures or spatially-extended ion

onion model comprising five layers, each of which corresponds to a category of
music content we identified: signal, embedded metadata, expert-generated
content, user-generated content, and derivative content. We provide a detailed
characterization of each category along several dimensions. Second, we identify
six overarching challenges, according to which we organize our main discussion:
increasing recommendation diversity and novelty, providing transparency and
explanations, accomplishing context-awareness, recommending sequences of music,
improving scalability and efficiency, and alleviating cold start. Each article
addresses one or more of these challenges is categorized according to the
content layers of our onion model, the article's goal(s), and main
methodological choices. Furthermore, articles are discussed in temporal order
to shed light on the evolution of content-driven music recommendation

well-studied Equality function with small error probability $\epsilon$, getting
the optimal constant factors in the leading terms in a number of different
models.
  In the randomized model,
  1) we give a general technique to convert public-coin protocols to
private-coin protocols by incurring a small multiplicative error, at a small
additive cost. This is an improvement over Newman's theorem [Inf. Proc.
Let.'91] in the dependence on the error parameter.
  2) Using this we obtain a $(\log(n/\epsilon^2)+4)$-cost private-coin
communication protocol that computes the $n$-bit Equality function, to error
$\epsilon$. This improves upon the $\log(n/\epsilon^3)+O(1)$ upper bound
implied by Newman's theorem, and matches the best known lower bound, which
follows from Alon [Comb. Prob. Comput.'09], up to an additive
$\log\log(1/\epsilon)+O(1)$.
  In the quantum model,
  1) we exhibit a one-way protocol of cost $\log(n/\epsilon)+4$, that uses only
pure states and computes the $n$-bit Equality function to error $\epsilon$.
This bound was implicitly already shown by Nayak [PhD thesis'99].
  2) We show that any $\epsilon$-error one-way protocol for $n$-bit Equality
that uses only pure states communicates at least
$\log(n/\epsilon)-\log\log(1/\epsilon)-O(1)$ qubits.
  3) We exhibit a one-way protocol of cost $\log(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon)+3$, that
uses mixed states and computes the $n$-bit Equality function to error
$\epsilon$. This is also tight up to an additive $\log\log(1/\epsilon)+O(1)$,
which follows from Alon's result.
  Our upper bounds also yield upper bounds on the approximate rank and related
measures of the Identity matrix. This also implies improved upper bounds on
these measures for the distributed SINK function, which was recently used to
refute the randomized and quantum versions of the log-rank conjecture.

challenging problem for action recognition. It requires learning deep and rich
features with superior distinctiveness for the subtle and abstract motions.
Most existing methods generate features of a layer in a pure feedforward
manner, where the information moves in one direction from inputs to outputs.
And they rely on stacking more layers to obtain more powerful features,
bringing extra non-negligible overheads. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive
Recursive Circle (ARC) framework, a fine-grained decorator for pure feedforward
layers. It inherits the operators and parameters of the original layer but is
slightly different in the use of those operators and parameters. Specifically,
the input of the layer is treated as an evolving state, and its update is
alternated with the feature generation. At each recursive step, the input state
is enriched by the previously generated features and the feature generation is
made with the newly updated input state. We hope the ARC framework can
facilitate fine-grained action recognition by introducing deeply refined
features and multi-scale receptive fields at a low cost. Significant
improvements over feedforward baselines are observed on several benchmarks. For
example, an ARC-equipped TSM-ResNet18 outperforms TSM-ResNet50 with 48% fewer
FLOPs and 52% model parameters on Something-Something V1 and Diving48.

one of its electrons. This results in the production of two singly charged ions

develop a theory of this process and apply it to calculate the fragmentation of
$^4$He$_2$, $^7$Li - $^4$He and $^6$Li - $^4$He dimers. Our results for the
helium dimer are in good agreement with available experimental data. For the
Li-He dimers (where experimental data are still absent) our results predict
that this fragmentation mechanism becomes much more efficient than in the case
of He$_2$. We also show that, provided the recoil effects are of minor

While these methods work well when the linear absorption is relatively small or
negligible, the retrieval process is more complicated for a strongly
scattering, dispersive or absorbing medium. The study of optics at the
nanoscale in the ps or fs regimes demands the development of new theoretical
tools experimental approaches, to extract and verify both linear and nonlinear
optical dispersions exhibited by matter, especially when material constituents
are fashioned into nanostructures of arbitrary shape. We present a practical,
combined experimental and theoretical approach based on a hydrodynamic model
that uses experimental results of harmonic generation conversion efficiencies
to retrieve complex, nonlinear dispersion curves, not necessarily only for
third order processes. We provide examples for materials that are of special
interest to nanophotonics, silicon, gold, and indium tin oxide, which displays
nonlocal effects and a zero-crossing of the real part of the dielectric

predictions based on the nonlinear oscillator model. Based on our assessment of
THG conversion efficiencies in silicon, we predict chi3(w) and chi3(3w) are of
order 10^(-17)(m/V)^2, in the visible and IR ranges, with respective peaks of
10^(-14) and 10^(-16)(m/V)^2 in the UV range. Similarly, gold's chi3(w) and

chi3(w)~10^(-17)(m/V)^2 and chi3(3w)~10^(-18)(m/V)^2 for ITO. These results

components of dark energy arise from the $F(R, G)$ gravity. After obtaining the
Einstein equation, the energy density and the pressure of dark energy are
written in terms of the geometries of the curvature and the Gauss-Bonnet terms,

continuity equations are written with the presence of interaction terms. In
what follows, we employ the EBEC regime instead of the normal dark matter by
the dark matter Equation of State (EoS) as $p_{dm} = \alpha \rho_{dm} + \beta
\rho_{dm}^2$, which arises from the gravitational form. The EoS can be
expressed from the perspective of the virial expansion, in which the first and

hole merger is a Kerr black hole. The approach to this final state is reached
through the emission of a late train of radiation known as the black hole
ringdown. The ringdown morphology is described by a countably infinite set of
damped sinusoids, whose complex frequencies are solely determined by the final
black hole's mass and spin. Recent results advocate that ringdown waveforms
from numerical relativity can be fully described from the peak of the strain
onwards if quasi-normal mode models with $N_{max}=7$ overtones are used. In
this work we extend this analysis to models with $N_{max}\geq 7$ up to
$N_{max}=16$ overtones by exploring the parameter bias on the final mass and
final spin obtained by fitting the nonprecessing binary black hole simulations
from the SXS catalogue. To this aim, we have computed the spin weight $-2$
quasi-normal mode frequencies and angular separation constants for the special
$(l=m=2, n=8,9)$ overtones for the Kerr spacetime. We find that a total of
$N_{max}\sim 6$ overtones are on average sufficient to model the ringdown
starting at the peak of the strain, although about $21\%$ of the cases studied
require at least $N_{max}\sim 12$ overtones to reach a comparable accuracy on
the final state parameters. Considering the waveforms from an earlier or later
point in time, we find that a very similar maximum accuracy can be reached in
each case, occurring at a different number of overtones $N_{max}$. We provide
new error estimates for the SXS waveforms based on the extrapolation and the
resolution uncertainties of the gravitational wave strain. Finally, we observe
substantial instabilities on the values of the best-fit amplitudes of the tones
beyond the fundamental mode and the first overtone, that, nevertheless, do not

applications in all branches of physics, including astrophysics, nuclear

the formulation of a mechanical problem to fewer degrees of freedom, a process
known as dynamical reduction. However, extant reductions are either
non-general, or hide the problem's symmetry or include unexplained definitions.
This paper presents a dynamical reduction that avoids these issues, and hence
is general and natural. Any three-body configuration defines a triangle, and
its orientation in space. Accordingly, we decompose the dynamical variables
into the geometry (shape + size) and orientation of the triangle. The geometry
variables are shown to describe the motion of an abstract point in a curved 3d
space, subject to a potential-derived force and a magnetic-like force with a
monopole charge. The orientation variables are shown to obey a dynamics
analogous to the Euler equations for a rotating rigid body, only here the
moments of inertia depend on the geometry variables, rather than being
constant. The reduction rests on a novel symmetric solution to the center of
mass constraint inspired by Lagrange's solution to the cubic. The formulation
of the orientation variables is novel and rests on a little known
generalization of the Euler-Lagrange equations to non-coordinate velocities.
Applications to global features, to the statistical solution and to special
exact solutions are presented. A generalization to the four-body problem is
presented.

an efficient way to tackle the dynamical problems in general mechanics,
including dissipation continuum systems, especially for those with
multi-physical field interactions and couplings. It is pointed out that, on the
contrary to the classical analytical mechanics, especially to existing
Hamiltonian mechanics, the physics essences of Hamilton's variational
principle, Lagrange's equation, and the Newtonian second law of motion,
including their derivatives such as momentum and angular momentum
conservations, are the consequences of the law of conservation of energy. In
addition, our proposed methodology is easier to understand with clear physical
meanings and can be used for explaining the existing mechanical principles or
theorems. Finally, as an application example, the methodology is applied in
fluid mechanics to derive Cauchy's first law of motion.

techniques that use a singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality
reduction. LSA has been extensively used to obtain low-dimensional
representations that capture relationships among documents and terms. In this
article, we present a theoretical analysis and comparison of the two techniques
in the context of document-term matrices. We show that CA has some attractive
properties as compared to LSA, for instance that effects of margins, i.e. sums
of row elements and column elements, arising from differing document-lengths
and term-frequencies are effectively eliminated, so that the CA solution is
optimally suited to focus on relationships among documents and terms. A
unifying framework is proposed that includes both CA and LSA as special cases.
We empirically compare CA to various LSA based methods on text categorization
in English and authorship attribution on historical Dutch texts, and find that
CA performs significantly better. We also apply CA to a long-standing question
regarding the authorship of the Dutch national anthem Wilhelmus and provide
further support that it can be attributed to the author Datheen, amongst
several contenders.

  Intensive Applications",,,,,"cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel memory-centric scheme based on CMOS SRAM
for acceleration of data intensive applications. Our proposal aims at
dynamically increasing the on-chip memory storage capacity of SRAM arrays
on-demand. The proposed scheme called - Augmented Memory Computing allows an
SRAM cell to operate in two different modes 1) the Normal mode and 2) the
Augmented mode. In the Normal mode of operation, the SRAM cell functions like a
standard 6 transistor (6T) SRAM cell, storing one bit of data in static format.
While in the Augmented mode, each SRAM cell can store >1 bit of data (in a
dynamic fashion). Specifically, we propose two novel SRAM cells - an 8
transistor (8T) dual bit storage augmented cell and a 7 transistor (7T) ternary
bit storage augmented cell. The proposed 8T dual bit SRAM cell when operated in
the Augmented mode, can store a static bit of data while also, simultaneously,
storing another bit in a dynamic form. Thus, when operated in Augmented mode,
the 8T SRAM cell can store two bits of data - one SRAM-like data and one
DRAM-like data, thereby increasing or augmenting the memory storage capacity.
On the other hand, the proposed 7T ternary bit storage augmented cell can
either store a single SRAM data in Normal mode or can be configured to operate
in Augmented mode, wherein it can store ternary data (3 levels (0,0), (0,1),
(1,0)) in a dynamic manner. Thus, based on the mode of operation, the proposed
augmented memory bit-cells can either store one static bit of data or >1 bit of
data in a dynamic format. We show the feasibility of our proposed bit-cells
through extensive simulations at Globalfoundries 22nm FDX node. It is worth
mentioning, the novel scheme of augmented memory bit-cells can be seamlessly
combined with existing in-memory computing approaches for added energy and
throughput benefits.

to mode collapse and vanishing gradients. The evolutionary generative
adversarial network (E-GAN) attempts to alleviate these issues by optimizing
the learning strategy with multiple loss functions. It uses a learning-based
evolutionary framework, which develops new mutation operators specifically for
general deep neural networks. However, the evaluation mechanism in the fitness
function of E-GAN cannot truly reflect the adaptability of individuals to their
environment, leading to an inaccurate assessment of the diversity of
individuals. Moreover, the evolution step of E-GAN only contains mutation
operators without considering the crossover operator jointly, isolating the
superior characteristics among individuals. To address these issues, we propose
an improved E-GAN framework called IE-GAN, which introduces a new fitness
function and a generic crossover operator. In particular, the proposed fitness
function, from an objective perspective, can model the evolutionary process of
individuals more accurately. The crossover operator, which has been commonly
adopted in evolutionary algorithms, can enable offspring to imitate the
superior gene expression of their parents through knowledge distillation.
Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
IE-GAN in terms of the quality of the generated samples and time efficiency.

family is the Bat algorithm (BA). The algorithm was first presented in 2010 by
Yang and quickly demonstrated its efficiency in comparison with other common
algorithms. The BA is based on echolocation in bats. The BA uses automatic
zooming to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation by imitating
the deviations of the bat's pulse emission rate and loudness as it searches for
prey. The BA maintains solution diversity using the frequency-tuning technique.
In this way, the BA can quickly and efficiently switch from exploration to
exploitation. Therefore, it becomes an efficient optimizer for any application
when a quick solution is needed. In this paper, an improvement on the original
BA has been made to speed up convergence and make the method more practical for
large applications. To conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis between the
original BA, the modified BA proposed in this paper, and other state-of-the-art
bio-inspired metaheuristics, the performance of both approaches is evaluated on
a standard set of 23 (unimodal, multimodal, and fixed-dimension multimodal)
benchmark functions. Afterward, the modified BA was applied to solve a
real-world job scheduling problem in hotels and restaurants. Based on the
achieved performance metrics, the proposed MBA establishes better global search
ability and convergence than the original BA and other approaches.
