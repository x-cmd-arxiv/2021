IRS-assisted system. We consider an IRS-assisted system with multiplicative
phase noise both at the BS and user. A novel channel estimation algorithm is
proposed considering the phase noise. By utilizing the proposed channel
estimates we investigate the system performance in the downlink, more
specifically, we derive the ergodic capacity in closed form. Simulation results
verify the correctness of the closed-form expression. We observe that the
system becomes more robust against the phase noise as the number of reflective
elements increases. Moreover, the influence of the additive channel noise in
uplink vanishes as the number of reflecting elements grows asymptotically
large.

predictive} and {\em retrospective} knowledge in reinforcement learning (RL).
In practice, often multiple interrelated GVFs need to be evaluated jointly with
pre-collected off-policy samples. In the literature, the gradient temporal
difference (GTD) learning method has been adopted to evaluate GVFs in the
off-policy setting, but such an approach may suffer from a large estimation
error even if the function approximation class is sufficiently expressive.
Moreover, none of the previous work have formally established the convergence
guarantee to the ground truth GVFs under the function approximation settings.
In this paper, we address both issues through the lens of a class of GVFs with
causal filtering, which cover a wide range of RL applications such as reward
variance, value gradient, cost in anomaly detection, stationary distribution
gradient, etc. We propose a new algorithm called GenTD for off-policy GVFs
evaluation and show that GenTD learns multiple interrelated multi-dimensional
GVFs as efficiently as a single canonical scalar value function. We further
show that unlike GTD, the learned GVFs by GenTD are guaranteed to converge to
the ground truth GVFs as long as the function approximation power is
sufficiently large. To our best knowledge, GenTD is the first off-policy GVF
evaluation algorithm that has global optimality guarantee.

detection of gravitational waves from NSBHs, improved measurements of the
neutron star equation-of-state, and the most modern numerical simulations of
ejected material from binary collisions to measure the relative contribution of
NSBHs and BNSs to the production of heavy elements. As the amount of r-process
ejecta depends on the mass and spin distribution of the compact objects, as
well as on the equation-of-state of the neutron stars, we consider various

find that in most scenarios, BNSs have produced more r-process elements than
NSBHs over the past 2.5 billion years. If black holes have preferentially small
spins, BNSs can produce at least twice of the amount of r-process elements than
NSBHs. If black hole spins are small and there is a dearth of low mass
($<5M_{\odot}$) black holes within NSBH binaries, BNSs can account for the near
totality of the r-process elements from binaries. For NSBH to produce large
fraction of r-process elements, black holes in NSBHs must have small masses and
large aligned spins, which is disfavored by current data.

major damage to the device from disruptions. Disruptions are the sudden breakup
of magnetic surfaces across the plasma volume -- a fast magnetic reconnection.
This reconnection can be caused by the growth of perturbations outside of the
plasma core causing an ideal perturbation to the core. This causes an
increasing ratio of the maximum to the minimum separation,
$\Delta_{max}/\Delta_{min}$, between neighboring magnetic surfaces. Magnetic
reconnection becomes a dominant process when magnetic field lines can quickly
interchange connections over a spatial scale $a_r$. This occurs when
$\Delta_{max}/\Delta_{min}\gtrsim a_r/\Delta_d$, where $\Delta_d$ is the scale
over which non-ideal effects make magnetic field lines indistinguishable.
Traditional reconnection theory is fundamentally different. It is a study of
the steady-state cancellation of oppositely directed magnetic field components
across a thin layer. During more than sixty years, mathematical implications of
Faraday's Law have been derived that clarify and constrain the physics of fast
magnetic reconnection. These are reviewed because they are not commonly known
but are needed to understand and to place in context how an ideal magnetic

first-person images exhibit strong bias in appearance among different
environments, adapting a pre-trained segmentation model to a new domain is
required in hand segmentation. Here, we focus on appearance gaps for hand
regions and backgrounds separately. We propose (i) foreground-aware image
stylization and (ii) consensus pseudo-labeling for domain adaptation of hand
segmentation. We stylize source images independently for the foreground and
background using target images as style. To resolve the domain shift that the
stylization has not addressed, we apply careful pseudo-labeling by taking a
consensus between the models trained on the source and stylized source images.
We validated our method on domain adaptation of hand segmentation from real and
simulation images. Our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in both
settings. We also demonstrated promising results in challenging multi-target
domain adaptation and domain generalization settings. Code is available at

Robust MPC-based energy management systems tend to under-utilize the renewable

we further consider droop control of renewable energy sources. For a microgrid
with droop-controlled units, we show that enhancing droop feedback with
saturation enlarges the space of feasible control actions. However, the

variables and equations representing saturation. We derive a computationally

of a peak. In addition, using both indicators we demonstrate that the evolution
of the {\it observed} CSFRD can be described by only {\bf 2} parameters and a
function that has the form of a Gamma distribution (${\bf \Gamma(a,bt)}$). In
contrast to previous parameterizations used in the literature our framework
connects the parameters to physical properties like the star formation rate
depletion time and cosmic baryonic gas density. The build up of stellar mass

force (ARF) pushes are used for inducing a shear-wave, which is tracked using
high frame-rate multi-angle plane wave imaging (MA-PWI) to estimate the
shear-wave speed (SWS). Conventionally, these plane waves are beamformed using
a constant speed-of-sound (SoS), assuming an a-priori known and homogeneous
tissue medium. However, soft tissues are inhomogeneous, with intrinsic SoS
variations. In this work, study the SoS effects and inhomogeneities on SWS
estimation, using simulation and phantoms experiments with porcine muscle as an
abbarator, and show how these aberrations can be corrected using local
speed-of-sound adaptive beamforming. For shear-wave tracking, we compare
standard beamform with spatially constant SoS values to software beamforming
with locally varying SoS maps. We show that, given SoS aberrations, traditional
beamforming using a constant SoS, regardless of the utilized SoS value,
introduces a substantial bias in resulting SWS estimations. Average SWS
estimation disparity for the same material was observed over 4.3 times worse
when a constant SoS value is used compared to that when a known SoS map is used
for beamforming. Such biases are shown to be corrected by using a local SoS map
in beamforming, indicating the importance of and a need for local SoS

attributes as unobservables in economic models, quantifying them can be
important to answer interesting economic questions. To propose an analytical
framework for this type of products, this paper considers one of the simplest
design products -- fonts -- and investigates merger and product differentiation
using an original dataset from the world's largest online marketplace for
fonts. We quantify font shapes by constructing embeddings from a deep
convolutional neural network. Each embedding maps a font's shape onto a
low-dimensional vector. In the resulting product space, designers are assumed
to engage in Hotelling-type spatial competition. From the image embeddings, we
construct two alternative measures that capture the degree of design
differentiation. We then study the causal effects of a merger on the merging
firm's creative decisions using the constructed measures in a synthetic control
method. We find that the merger causes the merging firm to increase the visual
variety of font design. Notably, such effects are not captured when using

quantum technologies whose performance can be significantly enhanced with
increasing numbers of entangled modes one could measure and thus utilize.
Photon pairs generated through the process of spontaneous parametric down
conversion are known to be entangled in a vast number of modes in the various
degrees of freedom (DOF) the photons possess such as time, energy, and
momentum, etc. Due to limitations in detection technology and techniques, often
only one such DOFs can be effectively measured at a time, resulting in much
lost potential. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, with the aid of a time
tagging camera, high speed measurement and characterization of two-photon
interference. {With a data acquisition time of only a few seconds, we observe a
bi-photon interference and coalescence visibility of $\sim64\%$ with
potentially up to $\sim2\times10^3$ spatial modes}. These results open up a
route for practical applications of using the high dimensionality of
spatiotemporal DOF in two-photon interference, and in particular, for quantum
sensing and communication.

trade-off underage and overage costs. In contrast to the typical setting, we
assume that the decision-maker does not know the underlying distribution
driving uncertainty but has only access to historical data. In turn, the key
questions are how to map existing data to a decision and what type of
performance to expect as a function of the data size. We analyze the classical
setting with access to past samples drawn from the distribution (e.g., past
demand), focusing not only on asymptotic performance but also on what we call
the transient regime of learning, i.e., performance for arbitrary data sizes.
We evaluate the performance of any algorithm through its worst-case relative
expected regret, compared to an oracle with knowledge of the distribution. We
provide the first finite sample exact analysis of the classical Sample Average
Approximation (SAA) algorithm for this class of problems across all data sizes.
This allows to uncover novel fundamental insights on the value of data: it
reveals that tens of samples are sufficient to perform very efficiently but
also that more data can lead to worse out-of-sample performance for SAA. We
then focus on the general class of mappings from data to decisions without any
restriction on the set of policies and derive an optimal algorithm (in the
minimax sense) as well as characterize its associated performance. This leads
to significant improvements for limited data sizes, and allows to exactly
quantify the value of historical information.

  To demonstrate the modeling power of submodular order functions we show
applications in two different settings. First, we apply our results to the
extensively studied problem of assortment optimization. While the objectives in
assortment optimization are known to be non-submodular (and non-monotone) even
for simple choice models, we show that they are compatible with the notion of
submodular order. Consequently, we obtain new and in some cases the first

consistent with a bound planet and modelled as such in a companion study. The
other four have very short durations (effective timescales less than 0.1 days)

formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) has at least $2^{n-1}$ satisfying

various AI communities interested in the complexity of probabilistic planning
and inference. Although Majority-SAT has been known to be PP-complete for over
40 years, the complexity of a natural variant has remained open:
Majority-$k$SAT, where the input CNF formula is restricted to have clause width
at most $k$.
  We prove that for every $k$, Majority-$k$SAT is in P. In fact, for any
positive integer $k$ and rational $\rho \in (0,1)$ with bounded denominator, we
give an algorithm that can determine whether a given $k$-CNF has at least $\rho
\cdot 2^n$ satisfying assignments, in deterministic linear time (whereas the
previous best-known algorithm ran in exponential time). Our algorithms have
interesting positive implications for counting complexity and the complexity of
inference, significantly reducing the known complexities of related problems
such as E-MAJ-$k$SAT and MAJ-MAJ-$k$SAT. At the heart of our approach is an
efficient method for solving threshold counting problems by extracting
sunflowers found in the corresponding set system of a $k$-CNF.
  We also show that the tractability of Majority-$k$SAT is somewhat fragile.
For the closely related GtMajority-SAT problem (where we ask whether a given

PP-complete, we show that GtMajority-$k$SAT is in P for $k\le 3$, but becomes
NP-complete for $k\geq 4$. These results are counterintuitive, because the
``natural'' classifications of these problems would have been PP-completeness,

condensates up to dimension-six and the perturbative part up to next-to-leading

application of $\phi_{2;a_1}^{\|}(x,\mu)$, we calculate the transition form
factors (TFFs) of $D\to a_1(1260)$ in large and intermediate momentum transfers

\[J_t(y,u):=\int_t^T\Lambda(s,y(s), u(s))\,ds+g(y(T))\] among the pairs $(y,u)$
satisfying a prescribed initial condition $y(t)=x$, where the state $y$ is
absolutely continuous, the control $u$ is summable and the dynamic is
controlled-linear of the form $y'=b(y)u$. For $b\equiv 1$ the above becomes a
problem of the calculus of variations. The Lagrangian $\Lambda(s,y,u)$ is
assumed to be either convex in the variable $u$ on every half-line from the
origin (radial convexity in $u$), or partial differentiable in the control
variable and satisfies a local Lipschitz regularity on the time variable, named
Condition (S). It is allowed to be extended valued, discontinuous in $y$ or in
$u$, and non convex in $u$.\\ We assume a very mild growth condition, that is
fulfilled if the Lagrangian is coercive as well as in some almost linear cases.
The main result states that, given any admissible pair $(y,u)$, there exists a
more convenient admissible pair $(\overline y, \overline u)$ for $J_t$ where
$\overline u$ is bounded, $\overline y$ is Lipschitz, with bounds and ranks
that are uniform with respect to $t,x$ in the compact subsets of
$[0,T[\times\mathbb R^n$. The result is new even in the superlinear case. As a
consequence, there are minimizing sequences that are formed by pairs of
equi-Lipschitz trajectories and equi--bounded controls.\\ A new existence and
regularity result follows without assuming any kind of Lipschitzianity in the
state variable.\\ We deduce, without any need of growth conditions, the
nonoccurrence of the Lavrentiev phenomenon for a wide class of Lagrangians
containing those that satisfy Condition (S), are bounded on bounded sets
``well'' inside the effective domain and are radially convex in the control
variable.

stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with side-information, where the
interventions correspond to the arms of the bandit instance. First, we propose
a simple regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a semi-Markovian
causal graph with atomic interventions and possibly unobservable variables, and
achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{M/T})$ expected simple regret, where $M$ is dependent
on the input CBN and could be very small compared to the number of arms. We
also show that this is almost optimal for CBNs described by causal graphs
having an $n$-ary tree structure. Our simple regret minimization results, both
upper and lower bound, subsume previous results in the literature, which
assumed additional structural restrictions on the input causal graph. In
particular, our results indicate that the simple regret guarantee of our
proposed algorithm can only be improved by considering more nuanced structural
restrictions on the causal graph. Next, we propose a cumulative regret
minimization algorithm that takes as input a general causal graph with all
observable nodes and atomic interventions and performs better than the optimal
MAB algorithm that does not take causal side-information into account. We also
experimentally compare both our algorithms with the best known algorithms in

significant effect of video-based general educational messages about

feedback based on individuals' past engagement with fake news, we find an
improvement of 0.14 standard deviations in identifying fake news. We also find

formally characterizing a sequence of actions and states using finite horizon
Markov decision processes and the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Building
upon this characterization, we formally state the problem of finding
counterfactual explanations for sequential decision making processes. In our
problem formulation, the counterfactual explanation specifies an alternative
sequence of actions differing in at most k actions from the observed sequence
that could have led the observed process realization to a better outcome. Then,
we introduce a polynomial time algorithm based on dynamic programming to build
a counterfactual policy that is guaranteed to always provide the optimal
counterfactual explanation on every possible realization of the counterfactual
environment dynamics. We validate our algorithm using both synthetic and real
data from cognitive behavioral therapy and show that the counterfactual
explanations our algorithm finds can provide valuable insights to enhance
sequential decision making under uncertainty.

We propose to automatically learn AGs based on actions observed through

unsupervised sequence learning system, SAGE, that leverages the temporal and
probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic
deterministic finite automaton (S-PDFA) -- a model that accentuates infrequent
severe alerts and summarizes paths leading to them. AGs are then derived from
the S-PDFA on a per-objective, per-victim basis. Tested with intrusion alerts
collected through Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition, SAGE compresses
over 330k alerts into 93 AGs. These AGs reflect the strategies used by the
participating teams. The AGs are succinct, interpretable, and capture
behavioral dynamics, e.g., that attackers will often follow shorter paths to
re-exploit objectives.

autoencoders for discovering the reduced basis representation, the dynamics of
which are then approximated by NODE. The ability of deep autoencoders to
represent the latent-space is compared to the traditional proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) approach, again in conjunction with NODE for capturing the
dynamics. Additionally, we compare their behavior with two classical
non-intrusive methods based on POD and radial basis function interpolation as
well as dynamic mode decomposition. The test problems we consider include
incompressible flow around a cylinder as well as a real-world application of
shallow water hydrodynamics in an estuarine system. Our findings indicate that
deep autoencoders can leverage nonlinear manifold learning to achieve a highly
efficient compression of spatial information and define a latent-space that
appears to be more suitable for capturing the temporal dynamics through the
NODE framework.

  For this problem, we design three new solutions, and the bounds of each can

  By setting appropriate parameter values for these solutions, we can achieve
new specific results with (the space are in words and $\epsilon$ is an
arbitrary constant in $(0,1)$):
  ** $O(n\lg^3 n)$ space and $O(\sqrt{n}\lg^{5/2} n \lg \lg n)$ query time;

  ** $O(n\lg n)$ space and $O(n^{1/2+\epsilon})$ query time.
  A known conditional lower bound to this problem based on Boolean matrix

polylogarithmic factor using purely combinatorial approaches. Thus the time and

Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes
advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that
current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are
typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also
produces sparse 3D points that can be used as ""free"" depth supervision during
training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating
depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can
render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster.
Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF
methods, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory
signal. And finally, we find that DS-NeRF can support other types of depth

2-inspired logical reasoning. We explore several variations on this theme in
which candidate generations from a neural sequence model are examined for
logical consistency by a symbolic reasoning module, which can either accept or

self-organized criticality. In this regard, we note that if the strange quark
were lighter, the QCD phase transition could have been first order, possibly
exhibiting quantum critical points at zero temperature as a function of the
Higgs vacuum expectation value $v_h$ smaller than (but near) the weak scale. We
show that these quantum critical points allow a dynamical selection of the
observed weak scale, via quantum-dominated stochastic evolutions of the value
of $v_h$ during eternal inflation. Although the values of $v_h$ in different
Hubble patches are described by a probability distribution in the multiverse,
inflationary quantum dynamics ensures that the peak of the distribution evolves
toward critical points (self-organized criticality), driven mainly by the
largest Hubble expansion rate there -- the Hubble selection of the universe. To
this end, we first explore the quantum critical points of the three-flavor QCD
linear sigma model, parametrized by $v_h$ at zero temperature, and we present a
relaxion model for the weak scale. Among the patches that have reached
reheating, it results in a sharp probability distribution of $v_h$ near the
observed weak scale, which is critical not to the crossover at $v_h=0$ but to
the sharp transition at ${\sim}\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.

detected when the randomized catalogs assume the form of a Gaussian ellipsoid

Based on their observed distributions and assuming a range of migration
timescales, we infer that the average value of the kick velocity inherited by
an HMXB during the formation of its compact object is 2-34 km/s. This is
considerably less than the value obtained for their counterparts in the Milky

X-ray weakness. We fit their UV SDSS spectra and analyse their CIV properties
(e.g., equivalent width, EW; line peak velocity, $\upsilon_{\rm peak}$) as a
function of the X-ray photon index and 2-10 keV flux. We confirm the trends of
CIV $\upsilon_{\rm peak}$ and EW with UV luminosity at 2500 angstrom for both
X-ray weak and X-ray normal quasars, as well as the correlation between X-ray
weakness and CIV EW. In contrast to some recent work, we do not observe any
clear relation between the 2-10 keV luminosity and $\upsilon_{\rm peak}$. We
find a correlation between the hard X-ray flux and the integrated CIV flux for
X-ray normal quasars, whilst X-ray weak quasars deviate from the main trend by
more than 0.5 dex. We argue that X-ray weakness might be interpreted in a
starved X-ray corona picture associated with an ongoing disc-wind phase. If the
wind is ejected in the vicinity of the black hole, the extreme-UV radiation
that reaches the corona will be depleted, depriving the corona of seeds photons
and generating an X-ray weak quasar. Yet, at the largest UV luminosities
(>10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$), there will still be an ample reservoir of ionising
photons that can explain the excess CIV emission observed in the X-ray weak
quasars with respect to normal sources of similar X-ray luminosities.

a lower $j_{\rm gas}$) than gas-poor ones. The slopes of the relations have a
value around 0.7. These new relations are amongst the tightest known scaling
laws for galaxies. In particular, the baryonic relation ($j_{\rm bar}-M_{\rm

only by typical discs but also by galaxies with extreme properties, such as
size and gas content, and by galaxies previously claimed to be outliers of the
standard 2D $j-M$ relations. The stellar relation ($j_{\ast}-M_{\ast}-f_{\rm

states in iron-based superconductors, we investigate the potential intrinsic
topological phases in a $C_{4z}$-rotational invariant superconducting Dirac
semimetal with $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing. When the normal state harbors only
surface Fermi arcs on the side surfaces, we find that an interesting gapped

The criteria for these two distinct topological phases have a simple geometric

reducing the bulk material to a thin film normal to the axis of rotation

galactic nuclei (AGN) detected by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE). By fitting broadband spectral energy distributions of sources in the
WISE AGN Catalog (Assef et al. 2018) with empirical galaxy and AGN templates,
we derive photometric redshifts, AGN bolometric luminosities, measures of AGN
obscuration, host galaxy stellar masses, and host galaxy star formation rates
(SFRs) for 695,273 WISE AGN. The wide-area nature of this catalog significantly
augments the known number of obscured AGN out to redshifts of z~3 and will be
useful for studies focused on AGN or their host galaxy physical properties. We
first show that the most likely non-AGN contaminants are galaxies at redshifts
of z=0.2-0.3, with relatively blue W1-W2 colors, and with high specific SFRs
for which the dust continuum emission is elevated in the W2 filter. Toward
increasingly lower redshifts, WISE AGN host galaxies have systematically lower
specific SFRs, relative to those of normal star forming galaxies, likely due to
decreased cold gas fractions and the time delay between global star formation
and AGN triggering. Finally, WISE AGN obscuration is not strongly correlated
with AGN bolometric luminosity but shows a significant negative correlation
with Eddington ratio. This result is consistent with a version of the `receding
torus' model in which the obscuring material is located within the supermassive
black hole gravitational sphere of influence and the dust inner radius
increases due to radiation pressure.

three key challenges are still unresolved. First, the identification of
topological band degeneracies that are generically rather than accidentally
located at the Fermi level. Second, the ability to easily control such
topological degeneracies. And third, to identify generic topological
degeneracies in large, multi-sheeted Fermi surfaces. Combining de Haas - van

protectorates (TPs) with substantial Berry curvatures at the intersection of
the NPs with the Fermi surface (FS) regardless of the complexity of the FS. We
predict that these TPs will be accompanied by sizeable Fermi arcs subject to
the direction of the magnetization. Deriving the symmetry conditions underlying
topological NPs, we show that the 1651 magnetic space groups comprise 7 grey

existence of similar properties, amenable for technological exploitation, in a

empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade model

begin opinion cascades. We conduct an analysis of the cognitive cascade model

superconducting pairing instabilities we add fluctuations of the fields beyond
saddle point approximation and calculate their response to an applied pulsed

the effect of the long-range Coulomb interaction. While the phase mode is
pushed into a plasmon frequency, as known from the literature, we show that the
BS mode remains unaffected. Furthermore, it has a characteristic polarization
dependence and, unlike the Higgs mode, generates a current in perpendicular

context of population games. We adhere to the prevailing framework consisting
of many agents, grouped into populations, that interact noncooperatively by
selecting strategies with a favorable payoff. Each agent is repeatedly allowed
to revise its strategy at a rate referred to as revision rate. Previous
stability results considered either that the payoff mechanism was a memoryless
potential game, or allowed for dynamics (in the payoff mechanism) at the
expense of precluding any explicit dependence of the agents' revision rates on
their current strategies. Allowing the dependence of revision rates on
strategies is relevant because the agents' strategies at any point in time are
generally unequal. To allow for strategy-dependent revision rates and payoff
mechanisms that are dynamic (or memoryless games that are not potential), we
focus on an evolutionary dynamics class obtained from a straightforward
modification of one that stems from the so-called impartial pairwise comparison
strategy revision protocol. Revision protocols consistent with the modified
class retain from those in the original one the advantage that the agents
operate in a fully decentralized manner and with minimal information
requirements - they need to access only the payoff values (not the mechanism)
of the available strategies. Our main results determine conditions under which
system-theoretic passivity properties are assured, which we leverage for
stability analysis.

colossus cadence is used, the number of recovered EBs would increase by an
overall factor of about 1.7 in the field and in globular clusters, and a factor
of about three in open clusters. Including semi-detached and contact systems

and high eccentricity of 0.92. The binary companion provides the unique
opportunity to measure the dynamical mass to compare with the results of rapid
rotator evolution models. The lack of data near periastron passage limited the
precision of mass measurements in previous work. We add new interferometric
data from the MIRC combiner at the CHARA Array as well as new Keck adaptive

We also obtained new radial velocities of both components at Fairborn

primary star mass at the few percent level. Our resulting primary star mass of
$2.20\pm0.06$ M$_{\odot}$ agrees well with predictions from imaging results,
and matches evolution models with rotation when plotting on an HR diagram.

models for this system we need $\sim$1\% errors on mass, which might be
achieved once the distance is known to higher precision in future Gaia
releases. We find that the secondary mass of $0.824\pm0.023$ M$_{\odot}$ is

criterion. By analyzing the solution of the orthogonalized Cp, we identify an
estimator that asymptotically approximates the solution of the Cp criterion in

  Logrank Test",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-sample tests with censored outcomes are a classical topic in statistics
with wide use even in cutting edge applications. There are at least two modes
of inference used to justify two-sample tests. One is usual superpopulation
inference assuming that units are independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) samples from some superpopulation; the other is finite population
inference that relies on the random assignments of units into different groups.
When randomization is actually implemented, the latter has the advantage of
avoiding distributional assumptions on the outcomes. In this paper, we focus on
finite population inference for censored outcomes, which has been less explored
in the literature. Moreover, we allow the censoring time to depend on treatment
assignment, under which exact permutation inference is unachievable. We find
that, surprisingly, the usual logrank test can also be justified by
randomization. Specifically, under a Bernoulli randomized experiment with
non-informative i.i.d. censoring, the logrank test is asymptotically valid for
testing Fisher's null hypothesis of no treatment effect on any unit. The
asymptotic validity of the logrank test does not require any distributional
assumption on the potential event times. We further extend the theory to the
stratified logrank test, which is useful for randomized block designs and when
censoring mechanisms vary across strata. In sum, the developed theory for the
logrank test from finite population inference supplements its classical theory
from usual superpopulation inference, and helps provide a broader justification
for the logrank test.

replacing any direct computation of pairwise similarities with element-wise

stochastic, and high-dimensional systems is a challenge of complex systems
research. Open questions are how to differentiate chaotic signals from
stochastic ones, and how to quantify nonlinear and/or high-order temporal
correlations. Here we propose a new technique to reliably address both
problems. Our approach follows two steps: first, we train an artificial neural
network (ANN) with flicker (colored) noise to predict the value of the
parameter, $\alpha$, that determines the strength of the correlation of the
noise. To predict $\alpha$ the ANN input features are a set of probabilities
that are extracted from the time series by using symbolic ordinal analysis.
Then, we input to the trained ANN the probabilities extracted from the time
series of interest, and analyze the ANN output. We find that the $\alpha$ value
returned by the ANN is informative of the temporal correlations present in the
time series. To distinguish between stochastic and chaotic signals, we exploit
the fact that the difference between the permutation entropy (PE) of a given
time series and the PE of flicker noise with the same $\alpha$ parameter is
small when the time series is stochastic, but it is large when the time series
is chaotic. We validate our technique by analysing synthetic and empirical time
series whose nature is well established. We also demonstrate the robustness of
our approach with respect to the length of the time series and to the level of
noise. We expect that our algorithm, which is freely available, will be very
useful to the community.

suffers from the out-of-vocabulary problem, where terms in a question may not

particularly problematic for the millions of entities that large knowledge

create a query template with placeholders that are filled by entities
identified in an EL phase. Slot filling is used to decide which entity fills
which placeholder. Experiments for QA over Wikidata show that our approach
outperforms pure NMT: while there remains a strong dependence on having seen
similar query templates during training, errors relating to entities are

are often used to filter out expensive accesses to a remote set S for negative
queries (that is, a query x not in S). Filters have one-sided errors: on a
negative query, a filter may say ""present"" with a tunable false-positve
probability of epsilon. Correctness is traded for space: filters only use log
(1/\epsilon) + O(1) bits per element.
  The false-positive guarantees of most filters, however, hold only for a
single query. In particular, if x is a false positive of a filter, a subsequent
query to x is a false positive with probability 1, not epsilon. With this in
mind, recent work has introduced the notion of an adaptive filter. A filter is
adaptive if each query has false positive epsilon, regardless of what queries
were made in the past. This requires ""fixing"" false positives as they occur.
  Adaptive filters not only provide strong false positive guarantees in
adversarial environments but also improve performance on query practical
workloads by eliminating repeated false positives.
  Existing work on adaptive filters falls into two categories. First, there are
practical filters based on cuckoo filters that attempt to fix false positives
heuristically, without meeting the adaptivity guarantee. Meanwhile, the broom
filter is a very complex adaptive filter that meets the optimal theoretical
bounds.
  In this paper, we bridge this gap by designing a practical, provably adaptive
filter: the telescoping adaptive filter. We provide theoretical false-positive
and space guarantees of our filter, along with empirical results where we
compare its false positive performance against state-of-the-art filters. We
also test the throughput of our filters, showing that they achieve comparable

of data taken under clear sky conditions over 12 months. We confirm that the
power output is linearly proportional to cos(theta), where theta is the angular
difference of direction toward the Sun and the vector perpendicular to the
panels. In order to confirm this we applied methods from astronomical
photometry reduction. From late March through August we find that the median
effective atmospheric extinction term is 0.145 mag/airmass. From October to
mid-March the median extinction term is 0.081 mag/airmass. The proportionality
""constant"" scaling cos(theta) appears to be seasonally dependent, with the
smallest scaling factors occurring when the extinction term is largest.
Finally, we find that extinction-corrected power often underperforms the linear
relationship late in the morning or early in the afternoon. This is most likely
because the efficiency of solar panels depends on their operating temperature,
and the panel temperature increases over the course of time on a sunny day.

a worse upper bound on the twin-width). The $k$-Independent Set problem admits
the same lower bound by a much simpler argument, previously observed [ICALP

challenging to predict workers' success and plan accordingly. In a competitive

another layer of uncertainty in crowd workers' decision-making process.
Preliminary analysis on software worker behaviors reveals an alarming task
dropping rate of 82.9%. These factors lead to the need for an automated
recommendation system for CSD workers to improve the visibility and
predictability of their success in the competition. To that end, this paper
proposes a collaborative recommendation system for crowd workers. The proposed
recommendation system method uses five input metrics based on workers'
collaboration history in the pool, workers' preferences in taking tasks in
terms of monetary prize and duration, workers' specialty, and workers'
proficiency. The proposed method then recommends the most suitable tasks for a
worker to compete on based on workers' probability of success in the task.
Experimental results on 260 active crowd workers demonstrate that just
following the top three success probabilities of task recommendations, workers
can achieve success up to 86%

tasks on their own. These arms are dexterous and high-dimensional; however, the
interfaces people must use to control their robots are low-dimensional.
Consider teleoperating a 7-DoF robot arm with a 2-DoF joystick. The robot is
helping you eat dinner, and currently you want to cut a piece of tofu. Today's
robots assume a pre-defined mapping between joystick inputs and robot actions:
in one mode the joystick controls the robot's motion in the x-y plane, in
another mode the joystick controls the robot's z-yaw motion, and so on. But
this mapping misses out on the task you are trying to perform! Ideally, one
joystick axis should control how the robot stabs the tofu and the other axis
should control different cutting motions. Our insight is that we can achieve
intuitive, user-friendly control of assistive robots by embedding the robot's
high-dimensional actions into low-dimensional and human-controllable latent
actions. We divide this process into three parts. First, we explore models for
learning latent actions from offline task demonstrations, and formalize the
properties that latent actions should satisfy. Next, we combine learned latent
actions with autonomous robot assistance to help the user reach and maintain
their high-level goals. Finally, we learn a personalized alignment model
between joystick inputs and latent actions. We evaluate our resulting approach
in four user studies where non-disabled participants reach marshmallows, cook
apple pie, cut tofu, and assemble dessert. We then test our approach with two
disabled adults who leverage assistive devices on a daily basis.

approach this problem through the lens of continuous-time Markov chains, and
show that the resulting learning task is generally underspecified in the usual
setting of cross-sectional data. We explore a perhaps surprising remedy:
including a number of additional independent items can help determine time
order, and hence resolve underspecification. This is in sharp contrast to the
common practice of limiting the analysis to a small subset of relevant items,
which is followed largely due to poor scaling of existing methods. To put our
theoretical insight into practice, we develop an approximate likelihood
maximization method for learning continuous-time Markov chains, which can scale
to hundreds of items and is orders of magnitude faster than previous methods.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic and real cancer

optimization problems is distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent
(DASGD), a family of algorithms that result from parallelizing stochastic
gradient descent on distributed computing architectures (possibly)
asychronously. However, a key obstacle in the efficient implementation of DASGD
is the issue of delays: when a computing node contributes a gradient update,
the global model parameter may have already been updated by other nodes several
times over, thereby rendering this gradient information stale. These delays can
quickly add up if the computational throughput of a node is saturated, so the
convergence of DASGD may be compromised in the presence of large delays. Our
first contribution is that, by carefully tuning the algorithm's step-size,
convergence to the critical set is still achieved in mean square, even if the
delays grow unbounded at a polynomial rate. We also establish finer results in
a broad class of structured optimization problems (called variationally
coherent), where we show that DASGD converges to a global optimum with
probability $1$ under the same delay assumptions. Together, these results
contribute to the broad landscape of large-scale non-convex stochastic
optimization by offering state-of-the-art theoretical guarantees and providing
insights for algorithm design.

Similar to the classic bin packing problem, an online sequence of items of
various sizes should be packed into a minimum number of bins of uniform
capacity. For applications such as server consolidation, where bins represent
servers and items represent jobs of different loads, it is required to maintain
fault-tolerant solutions. In a fault-tolerant packing, any job is replicated
into f+1 servers, for some integer f > 1, so that the failure of up to f
servers does not interrupt service. We build over a practical model introduced
by Li and Tang [SPAA 2017] in which each job of load $x$ has a primary replica
of load $x$ and $f$ standby replicas, each of load $x/\eta$, where $\eta >1$ is
a parameter of the problem. Upon failure of up to $f$ servers, any primary
replica in a failed bin should be replaced by one of its standby replicas so
that the extra load of the new primary replica does not cause an overflow in
its bin. We study a general setting in which bins might fail while the input is
still being revealed. Our main contribution is an algorithm, named
Harmonic-Stretch, which maintains fault-tolerant packings under this general
setting. We prove that Harmonic-Stretch has an asymptotic competitive ratio of
at most 1.75. This is an improvement over the best existing asymptotic
competitive ratio 2 of an algorithm by Li and Tang [TPDS 2020], which works
under a model in which bins fail only after all items are packed.

number of kinematical studies investigating its rotation curve and its dark

asymmetry of the rotation curve, which shows a significant discrepancy between
the approaching and the receding side. We first examine whether an $m = 1$
perturbation (lopsidedness) in the halo potential could be a mechanism creating
such kinematical asymmetry. To do so, we fit a theoretical rotational velocity
associated with an $m = 1$ perturbation in the halo potential model to the
observed data via a $\chi-$squared minimization method. We show that a lopsided
halo potential model can explain the asymmetry in the kinematic data reasonably
well. We then verify that the kinematical classification of WLM shows that its
velocity field is significantly perturbed due to both its asymmetrical rotation
curve and also its peculiar velocity dispersion map. In addition, based on a
kinemetry analysis, we find that it is possible for WLM to lie in the
transition region, where the disk and merger coexist. In conclusion, it appears
that the rotation curve of WLM diverges significantly from that of an ideal
rotating disk, which may significantly affect investigations of its dark matter

animal to survive. To this end, most animals use the sub-second excitable and
multistable dynamics of a neuromuscular system. Here, studying an animal
without neurons or muscles, we report analogous excitable and multistable
dynamics embedded in the physics of a 'walking' cilium. We define a 'walking
cilium' as a phenomena where the locomotive force is generated through contact
with a substrate which is periodically reset by steps in the direction of
motion. We begin by showing that cilia can walk without specialized gait
control and identify the characteristic scales of spatio-temporal height
fluctuations of the tissue. With the addition of surface interaction, we
construct a low-order dynamical model of this single-cilium sub-unit. In
addition to studying the dynamics of a single cilium in isolation, we
subsequently examine collections of these walking cilia. En route to an
emergent model for ciliary walking, we demonstrate the limits of substrate
mediated synchronization between cilia. In the desynchronized limit, our model
shows evidence of localized multi-stability mediated by the crosstalk between
locomotive forcing and height. The out-of-equilibrium mechanics -- which govern
this emergent excitable bistability -- directly control the locomotive forcing
of a walking cilia. This direct coupling bypasses the role of the synaptic
junctions between neurons and muscles. We show a minimal mechanism -- trigger
waves -- by which these walking cells may work together to achieve
organism-scale collaboration, such as coordination of hunting strikes across

behavior of a simple animal (\textit{Trichoplax adhaerens}) without muscles or

visualization of large ciliary arrays, we report the discovery of sub-second
ciliary reorientations under a rotational torque that is mediated by collective
tissue mechanics and the adhesion of cilia to the underlying substrate. In a
toy model, we show a mapping of this system onto an ""active-elastic resonator"".
This framework explains how perturbations propagate information in this array
as linear speed traveling waves in response to mechanical stimulus. Next, we
explore the implications of parametric driving in this active-elastic resonator
and show that such driving can excite mechanical 'spikes'. These spikes in
collective mode amplitudes are consistent with a system driven by parametric
amplification and a saturating nonlinearity. We conduct extensive numerical
experiments to corroborate these findings within a polarized active-elastic
sheet. These results indicate that periodic and stochastic forcing are valuable
for increasing the sensitivity of collective ciliary flocking. We support these
theoretical predictions via direct experimental observation of linear speed
traveling waves which arise from the hybridization of spin and overdamped
density waves. We map how these ciliary flocking dynamics result in agile
motility via coupling between an amplified resonator and a tuning
(Goldstone-like) mode of the system. This sets the stage for how activity and
elasticity can self-organize into behavior which benefits the organism as a

simple animal, the manifolds underlying the governing dynamics are shaped and
stabilized by a physical mechanism: an active-elastic, inverse-energy cascade.
Building upon pioneering work in the field, we explore the formulation of the
governing dynamics of a polarized active elastic sheet in terms of the normal
modes of an elastic structure decorated by a polarized activity at every node.
By incorporating a torque mediated coupling physics, we show that power is
pumped from the shortest length scale up to longer length scale modes via a
combination of direct mode coupling and preferential dissipation. We use this

have been used to measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale;
providing tighter constraints on cosmological parameters when combined with
matter tracers. These voids are defined as spheres larger than a given radius
threshold, which is constant over the survey volume. However, the response of
these void tracers to observational systematics has not yet been studied. In
this work we analyse the response of void clustering to selection effects. We
find for the case of moderate (<20 per cent) incompleteness, void selection
based on a constant radius cut yields robust measurements. This is particularly
true for BAO-reconstructed galaxy samples, where large-scale void exclusion
effects are mitigated. Moreover, we observe for the case of severe (up to 90
per cent) incompleteness -- such as can be found at the edges of the radial
selection function -- that an accurate estimation of the void distribution is
necessary for unbiased clustering measurements. In addition, we find that
without reconstruction, using a constant threshold under these conditions
produces a stronger void exclusion effect that can affect the clustering on
large scales. A new void selection criteria dependent on the (local) observed
tracer density that maximises the BAO peak significance prevents the
aforementioned exclusion features from contaminating the BAO signal. Finally,
we verify, with large simulations including light cone evolution, that both
void sample definitions (local and constant) yield unbiased and consistent BAO
scale measurements.

  Well-conditioned Normalizing Flows","40 pages, 0 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Normalizing flows are a widely used class of latent-variable generative
models with a tractable likelihood. Affine-coupling (Dinh et al, 2014-16)
models are a particularly common type of normalizing flows, for which the
Jacobian of the latent-to-observable-variable transformation is triangular,
allowing the likelihood to be computed in linear time. Despite the widespread
usage of affine couplings, the special structure of the architecture makes
understanding their representational power challenging. The question of
universal approximation was only recently resolved by three parallel papers
(Huang et al.,2020;Zhang et al.,2020;Koehler et al.,2020) -- who showed
reasonably regular distributions can be approximated arbitrarily well using
affine couplings -- albeit with networks with a nearly-singular Jacobian. As
ill-conditioned Jacobians are an obstacle for likelihood-based training, the
fundamental question remains: which distributions can be approximated using
well-conditioned affine coupling flows?
  In this paper, we show that any log-concave distribution can be approximated
using well-conditioned affine-coupling flows. In terms of proof techniques, we
uncover and leverage deep connections between affine coupling architectures,
underdamped Langevin dynamics (a stochastic differential equation often used to
sample from Gibbs measures) and H\'enon maps (a structured dynamical system
that appears in the study of symplectic diffeomorphisms). Our results also
inform the practice of training affine couplings: we approximate a padded
version of the input distribution with iid Gaussians -- a strategy which
Koehler et al.(2020) empirically observed to result in better-conditioned
flows, but had hitherto no theoretical grounding. Our proof can thus be seen as
providing theoretical evidence for the benefits of Gaussian padding when
training normalizing flows.

average longer microlensing events with smaller projected source radii toward
these clouds. For these microlensing events, the relative lens-source
velocities are on average smaller. The MC self-lensing events due to FFPs
suffer from severe finite-source effects. We first simulate microlensing events
due to FFPs towards MCs and assume a log-uniform step function for their mass.
The efficiencies for capturing their lensing signatures (with signal-to-noise
greater than $50$) are found to be $0.1$-$0.6\%$ and $3$-$6\%$ through
ground-based optical surveys and space-based near-infrared surveys,
respectively. We then promote these simulations and assume the

heuristic for graph isomorphism is the Weisfeiler-Leman test together with its
higher order variants. On the other hand, both problems can be reformulated as

the relaxation time is dominated by ionized impurity scattering and increases
with temperature, a feature that maintains the power factor at high values at
higher temperatures and simultaneously causes the carrier thermal conductivity
at zero electric current (k_el) to decrease faster for higher temperatures,
leading to an ultrahigh-zT = 3.1 at 807 K. We rationalize the roles played by
k_el and k^0 (the thermal conductivity due to carrier transport under

ratio between k^0 and the lattice thermal conductivity indeed corresponds to
the upper limit for zT, whereas the difference between calculated zT and the

uniform persistence if $\mathscr{R}_{0}>1$. Taking Indian dates for example in

indispensable even if all the people were vaccinated when the efficiency of
vaccine is relatively low. By simulating the relation ships of the basic
reproduction number $\mathscr{R}_{0}$, the vaccination rate and the efficiency
of vaccine, we find that it is impossible to achieve the herd immunity without
NPIs when the efficiency of vaccine is lower than $76.9\%$. Therefore, the herd
immunity area is defined by the evolution of relationships between the

an appropriate dispersal of population between India and China is obtained. A

Third, to further improve pixel-level classification accuracy, we develop a

The present work extends these results to Dirac fields on the same geometrical

metrics for scalar fields. The method combines the Penrose conformal
compactification and geometric energy estimates in order to work out a
definition of the peeling at all orders in terms of Sobolev regularity near
$\mathscr{I}$, instead of ${\mathcal C}^k$ regularity at $\mathscr{I}$, then
provides the optimal spaces of initial data such that the associated solution
satisfies the peeling at a given order. The results confirm that the analogous
decay and regularity assumptions on initial data in Minkowski and in Kerr
produce the same regularity across null infinity. Our results are local near
spacelike infinity and are valid for all values of the angular momentum of the
spacetime, including for fast Kerr metrics.

the quantum phase diagram of a related bond-directional spin-$3/2$ model by the

from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic, three magnetically ordered phases,
i.e., a ferromagnetic phase, a $120^\circ$ phase and an antiferromagnetic

shape segmentation and remarkable performance has been achieved on various
benchmark datasets. These supervised methods require a large amount of
annotated data to train deep neural networks to ensure the generalization
ability on the unseen test set. In this paper, we introduce a
meta-learning-based method for few-shot 3D shape segmentation where only a few
labeled samples are provided for the unseen classes. To achieve this, we treat
the shape segmentation as a point labeling problem in the metric space.
Specifically, we first design a meta-metric learner to transform input shapes
into embedding space and our model learns to learn a proper metric space for
each object class based on point embeddings. Then, for each class, we design a
metric learner to extract part-specific prototype representations from a few
support shapes and our model performs per-point segmentation over the query
shapes by matching each point to its nearest prototype in the learned metric
space. A metric-based loss function is used to dynamically modify distances
between point embeddings thus maximizes in-part similarity while minimizing
inter-part similarity. A dual segmentation branch is adopted to make full use
of the support information and implicitly encourages consistency between the
support and query prototypes. We demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed on the ShapeNet part dataset under the few-shot scenario, compared
with well-established baseline and state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.

of non-simply-laced affine type can be obtained by folding a cluster algebra of

the combinatorial properties of quivers in the cluster algebra of affine type.

efficiently construct training data and improve the mapping speed, which is a
major bottleneck for real-world deployments. Our method achieves real-time
mapping even on a consumer-grade CPU. Another important benefit is that our
method can handle dynamic scenarios, thanks to the coverage completeness of the
proposed algorithm. Experiments on real-world point cloud scan datasets are
presented.

proves that these events are ideal sites for the production of heavy
$r$-process elements. The gamma-ray photons produced by the radioactive decay

study the gamma-ray emission in a merger ejecta on a timescale of a few days.
It is found that the total gamma-ray energy generation rate evolution is
roughly depicted as $\dot{E}\propto t^{-1.3}$. For the dynamical ejecta with a
low electron fraction ($Y_{\rm e}\lesssim0.20$), the dominant contributors of

attention in quantum computing, since several well-known quantum algorithms
including Shor algorithm can be described in a uniform framework as quantum
methods to address different instances of it. One of the central issues about
$\mathsf{HSP}$ is to characterize its quantum/classical complexity. For
example, from the viewpoint of learning theory, sample complexity is a crucial
concept. However, while the quantum sample complexity of the problem has been
studied, a full characterization of the classical sample complexity of
$\mathsf{HSP}$ seems to be absent, which will thus be the topic in this paper.
$\mathsf{HSP}$ over a finite group is defined as follows: For a finite group
$G$ and a finite set $V$, given a function $f:G \to V$ and the promise that for
any $x, y \in G, f(x) = f(xy)$ iff $y \in H$ for a subgroup $H \in
\mathcal{H}$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is a set of candidate subgroups of $G$, the
goal is to identify $H$.
  Our contributions are as follows: For $\mathsf{HSP}$, we give the upper and
lower bounds on the sample complexity of $\mathsf{HSP}$. Furthermore, we have
applied the result to obtain the sample complexity of some concrete instances
of hidden subgroup problem. Particularly, we discuss generalized Simon's

sample complexity of $\mathsf{GSP}$ is $\Theta\left(\max\left\{k,\sqrt{k\cdot

proven to be a powerful feature extractor in HS image classification. However,
CNNs fail to mine and represent the sequence attributes of spectral signatures
well due to the limitations of their inherent network backbone. To solve this
issue, we rethink HS image classification from a sequential perspective with
transformers, and propose a novel backbone network called \ul{SpectralFormer}.
Beyond band-wise representations in classic transformers, SpectralFormer is
capable of learning spectrally local sequence information from neighboring
bands of HS images, yielding group-wise spectral embeddings. More
significantly, to reduce the possibility of losing valuable information in the
layer-wise propagation process, we devise a cross-layer skip connection to
convey memory-like components from shallow to deep layers by adaptively
learning to fuse ""soft"" residuals across layers. It is worth noting that the
proposed SpectralFormer is a highly flexible backbone network, which can be
applicable to both pixel- and patch-wise inputs. We evaluate the classification
performance of the proposed SpectralFormer on three HS datasets by conducting
extensive experiments, showing the superiority over classic transformers and

The cranially-mounted system was fully-implanted bilaterally into the

thalamocortical rhythm-specific tuning of frequency parameters as well as
fast-adaptive modes based on activity, the canine experienced no further SE

composed of multiple sub-components, where these components may be agents or

domain-specific simulations can capture complex dynamics and subgroup
interaction, but optimizing over such simulations can be computationally and
algorithmically challenging. Bayesian approaches, such as Gaussian processes
(GPs), can be used to learn a computationally tractable approximation to the
underlying dynamics but typically neglect the detailed information about
subgroups in the complicated system. We attempt to find the best of both worlds
by proposing the idea of decomposed feedback, which captures group-based
heterogeneity and dynamics. We introduce a novel decomposed GP regression to
incorporate the subgroup decomposed feedback. Our modified regression has
provably lower variance -- and thus a more accurate posterior -- compared to
previous approaches; it also allows us to introduce a decomposed GP-UCB
optimization algorithm that leverages subgroup feedback. The Bayesian nature of
our method makes the optimization algorithm trackable with a theoretical
guarantee on convergence and no-regret property. To demonstrate the wide
applicability of this work, we execute our algorithm on two disparate social

allocation of distributed weather sensors. Experimental results show that our

by utilizing transferable information learned from the available source domain
and a few labeled target data. However, source data is not always accessible in
practical scenarios, which restricts the application of SSDA in real world
circumstances. In this paper, we propose a novel task named Semi-supervised
Source Hypothesis Transfer (SSHT), which performs domain adaptation based on
source trained model, to generalize well in target domain with a few
supervisions. In SSHT, we are facing two challenges: (1) The insufficient
labeled target data may result in target features near the decision boundary,
with the increased risk of mis-classification; (2) The data are usually
imbalanced in source domain, so the model trained with these data is biased.
The biased model is prone to categorize samples of minority categories into
majority ones, resulting in low prediction diversity. To tackle the above
issues, we propose Consistency and Diversity Learning (CDL), a simple but
effective framework for SSHT by facilitating prediction consistency between two
randomly augmented unlabeled data and maintaining the prediction diversity when
adapting model to target domain. Encouraging consistency regularization brings
difficulty to memorize the few labeled target data and thus enhances the
generalization ability of the learned model. We further integrate Batch
Nuclear-norm Maximization into our method to enhance the discriminability and
diversity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing SSDA
methods and unsupervised model adaptation methods on DomainNet, Office-Home and

the yields of a single 25-solar-mass magnetorotational hypernova. Such a
hypernova could produce not only the r-process elements, but also light
elements during stellar evolution, and iron-peak elements during explosive
nuclear burning. Hypernovae are often associated with long-duration gamma-ray

application to AGV motion estimation and 3D reconstruction with a single

identifications of binary star clusters have provided new insights into the
formation process and subsequent dynamical evolution of star clusters. The
early dynamical evolution of clumpy stellar structures provides the conditions
for the origin of binary star clusters. Here, we carry out $N$-body simulations
in order to investigate the formation of binary star clusters in the Milky Way
and in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that binary star clusters can
form from stellar aggregates with a variety of initial conditions. For a given
initial virial ratio, a higher degree of initial substructure results in a
higher fraction of binary star clusters. The number of binary star clusters
decreases over time due to merging or dissolution of the binary system.
Typically, $\sim 45\%$ of the aggregates evolve into binary/multiple clusters
within $t=20$~Myr in the Milky Way environment, while merely $\sim30\%$
survives beyond $t=50$~Myr, with separations $\lesssim 50$~pc. On the other
hand, in the LMC, $\sim 90\%$ of the binary/multiple clusters survive beyond
$t=20$~Myr and the fraction decreases to $\sim 80\%$ at $t=50$~Myr, with
separations $\lesssim 35~$pc. Multiple clusters are also rapidly formed for
highly-substructured and expanding clusters. The additional components tend to
detach and the remaining binary star cluster merges. The merging process can
produce fast rotating star clusters with mostly flat rotation curves that speed
up in the outskirts.

representations of users and items from observed interactions. Existing
CF-based methods commonly adopt negative sampling to discriminate different
items. Training with negative sampling on large datasets is computationally
expensive. Further, negative items should be carefully sampled under the
defined distribution, in order to avoid selecting an observed positive item in
the training dataset. Unavoidably, some negative items sampled from the
training dataset could be positive in the test set. In this paper, we propose a
self-supervised collaborative filtering framework (SelfCF), that is specially

framework simplifies the Siamese networks and can be easily applied to existing
deep-learning based CF models, which we refer to as backbone networks. The main
idea of SelfCF is to augment the output embeddings generated by backbone
networks, because it is infeasible to augment raw input of user/item ids. We
propose and study three output perturbation techniques that can be applied to
different types of backbone networks including both traditional CF models and

namely, graphs with a probability distribution $p$ associated with the edges,
such that an edge $e$ exists in the graph with probability $p(e)$. The input to
the problem consists of a vertex-weighted uncertain graph $\G=(V, E, p,
\omega)$ and an integer {\em budget} (or {\em solution size}) $k$, and the
objective is to compute a vertex set $S$ of size $k$ that maximizes the
expected total domination (or total weight) of vertices in the closed
neighborhood of $S$. We refer to the problem as the {\em Probabilistic Budgeted
Dominating Set}~(PBDS) problem and present the following results.
\begin{enumerate} \dnsitem We show that the PBDS problem is NP-complete even
when restricted to uncertain {\em trees} of diameter at most four. This is in
sharp contrast with the well-known fact that the BDS problem is solvable in
polynomial time in trees. We further show that PBDS is \wone-hard for the
budget parameter $k$, and under the {\em Exponential time hypothesis} it cannot
be solved in $n^{o(k)}$ time.
  \item We show that if one is willing to settle for $(1-\epsilon)$
approximation, then there exists a PTAS for PBDS on trees. Moreover, for the
scenario of uniform edge-probabilities, the problem can be solved optimally in
polynomial time.
  \item We consider the parameterized complexity of the PBDS problem, and show
that Uni-PBDS (where all edge probabilities are identical) is \wone-hard for
the parameter pathwidth. On the other hand, we show that it is FPT in the
combined parameters of the budget $k$ and the treewidth.
  \item Finally, we extend some of our parameterized results to planar and
apex-minor-free graphs. \end{enumerate}

translation and manipulation. However, high-fidelity image generation with
faithful style control remains a grand challenge in computer vision. This paper
presents a versatile image translation and manipulation framework that achieves
accurate semantic and style guidance in image generation by explicitly building
a correspondence. To handle the quadratic complexity incurred by building the
dense correspondences, we introduce a bi-level feature alignment strategy that
adopts a top-$k$ operation to rank block-wise features followed by dense
attention between block features which reduces memory cost substantially. As
the top-$k$ operation involves index swapping which precludes the gradient
propagation, we approximate the non-differentiable top-$k$ operation with a
regularized earth mover's problem so that its gradient can be effectively
back-propagated. In addition, we design a novel semantic position encoding
mechanism that builds up coordinate for each individual semantic region to
preserve texture structures while building correspondences. Further, we design
a novel confidence feature injection module which mitigates mismatch problem by
fusing features adaptively according to the reliability of built
correspondences. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior
performance qualitatively and quantitatively as compared with the

While extensive research has focused on the framework design and loss function,
this paper shows that sampling strategy plays an equally important role. We
analyze the reasons for the performance differences between various sampling
strategies under the same framework and loss function. We suggest that
deteriorated over-fitting is an important factor causing poor performance, and
enhancing statistical stability can rectify this problem. Inspired by that, a
simple yet effective approach is proposed, termed group sampling, which gathers
samples from the same class into groups. The model is thereby trained using
normalized group samples, which helps alleviate the negative impact of
individual samples. Group sampling updates the pipeline of pseudo-label
generation by guaranteeing that samples are more efficiently classified into
the correct classes. It regulates the representation learning process,
enhancing statistical stability for feature representation in a progressive
fashion. Extensive experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 show
that group sampling achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods

anchoring that enables robots to track objects in a persistent manner. Our
rule-based approach considers inductive biases to perform high-level reasoning
over the results from low-level object detection, and it improves the robot's
perceptual capability for complex tasks. We evaluate our model against existing
baseline models for object permanence and show that it outperforms these on a

In this model, given a directed graph with edge costs and edge capacities, each
agent wants to construct a path from a source to a sink with low cost. The
users share the cost of each edge based on a cost-sharing function. One of the
simple cost-sharing functions is defined as the cost divided by the number of
users. Most of the previous papers about cost-sharing connection games
addressed this cost-sharing function. It models an ideal setting where no
overhead arises when people share things, though it might be quite rare in real
life; it is more realistic to consider the setting that the cost paid by an
agent is the original cost per the number of agents using the edge plus the
overhead. In this paper, we model the more realistic scenario of cost-sharing
connection games by generalizing cost-sharing functions. The arguments on the
model are based on not concrete cost-sharing functions but cost-sharing
functions under a reasonable scheme; they are applicable for a broad class of
cost-sharing functions satisfying the following natural properties: they are
(1) non-increasing, (2) lower bounded by the original cost per the number of
the agents, and (3) upper bounded by the original cost, which enables to
represent various scenarios of cost-sharing. We investigate the Price of
Anarchy (PoA) and the Price of Stability (PoS) under sum-cost and max-cost
criteria with the generalized cost-sharing function. Despite the
generalization, we obtain the same tight bounds of PoA and PoS as the
cost-sharing with no overhead except PoS under sum-cost. Moreover, for the
sum-cost case, the lower bound on PoS increases from $\log n$ to $n+1/n-1$ by
the generalization, which is also almost tight because the upper bound is $n$.

of this article. For the purpose of this article, it provides the basis for
deriving the asymptotic distribution of the distance covariance of subordinated
Gaussian processes. Depending on the dependence in the data, the
standardization and the limit of distance correlation vary. In any case, the
limit is not feasible, such that test decisions are based on a subsampling
procedure. We prove the validity of the subsampling procedure and assess the
finite sample performance of a hypothesis test based on the distance
covariance. In particular, we compare its finite sample performance to that of
a test based on Pearson's sample correlation coefficient. For this purpose, we
additionally establish convergence results for this dependence measure.
Different dependencies between the vectors are considered. It turns out that
only linear correlation is better detected by Pearson's sample correlation

increasing the drag on streamlined bodies. Other flow features such as
freestream pressure gradients and streamwise boundary layer growth also
strongly influence the skin friction. In this paper, an angular momentum
integral (AMI) equation is introduced to quantify these effects by representing
them as torques that alter the shape of the mean velocity profile. This
approach uniquely isolates the skin friction of a Blasius boundary layer in a
single term that depends only on the Reynolds number, so that other torques are
interpreted as augmentations relative to the laminar case having the same
Reynolds number. The AMI equation for external flows shares this key property
with the so-called FIK relation for internal flows [Fukagata et al. 2002, Phys.
Fluids, \textbf{14}, L73-L76]. Without a geometrically imposed boundary layer
thickness, the length scale in the Reynolds number for the AMI equation may be
chosen freely. After a brief demonstration using Falkner-Skan boundary layers,
the AMI equation is applied as a diagnostic tool on four transitional and
turbulent boundary layer DNS datasets. Regions of negative wall-normal velocity
are shown to play a key role in limiting the peak skin friction during the late
stages of transition, and the relative strengths of terms in the AMI equation
become independent of the transition mechanism a very short distance into the
fully-turbulent regime. The AMI equation establishes an intuitive, extensible
framework for interpreting the impact of turbulence and flow control strategies
on boundary layer skin friction.

proposed based on the gravitational perturbation by a non-axisymmetric
quadrupole moment of their host stars. Such a quadrupole is due to the magnetic
flux tubes in the stellar convection zone, unevenly distributed in longitude
and persisting for many stellar rotations as observed in young late-type stars.
The rotation period of the host star evolves from its shortest value on the
zero-age main sequence to longer periods due to the loss of angular momentum
through a magnetized wind. If the stellar rotation period comes close to twice
the orbital period of the planet, the quadrupole leads to a spin-orbit
resonance that excites oscillations of the star-planet separation. As a
consequence, a strong tidal dissipation is produced inside the planet. We
illustrate the operation of the mechanism by modeling the evolution of the
stellar rotation and of the innermost planetary orbit in the cases of CoRoT-7,
Kepler-78, and K2-141 whose present orbital periods range between 0.28 and 0.85
days. If the spin-orbit resonance occurs, the maximum power dissipated inside
the planets ranges between $10^{18}$ and $10^{19}$ W, while the total
dissipated energy is of the order of $10^{30}-10^{32}$ J over a time interval
as short as $(1-4.5) \times 10^{4}$ yr. Such a huge heating over a so short
time interval produces a complete melting of the planetary interiors and may
shut off their hydromagnetic dynamos. These may initiate a successive phase of
intense internal heating owing to unipolar magnetic star-planet interactions
and affect the composition and the escape of their atmospheres, producing
effects that could be observable during the entire lifetime of the planets

the six model parameters, extending previous analyses based on a
maximum-likelihood approach. The method is tested across an astrophysically
plausible parameter domain using Monte Carlo simulations. It recovers the

efficiently in $\mathcal O(1)$ CPU-hr for data sets of the above size. In a

only, the method accurately estimates three parameters: the relaxation time,
the ensemble-averaged spin-down of the system, and the amplitude of the
stochastic torques applied to the crust. In a future observational scenario,
where gravitational wave data are also available, the method also estimates the
ratio between the moments of inertia of the crust and the superfluid, the
amplitude of the stochastic torque applied to the superfluid, and the

Convolutional Neural Network (i.e., CNN) for image feature extraction and a
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for caption generation. In particular, we
investigate attacks on the visual encoder's hidden layer that is fed to the
subsequent recurrent network. The existing methods either attack the

adversarial attacks on vision systems with language component. The proposed

examines if a neural image captioning system can be misled to output targeted

comprehensively study BBRv2's performance under various network conditions and

benefits come with several costs, including the slow responsiveness to
bandwidth dynamics as well as the low resilience to random losses. We then
propose BBRv2+ to address BBRv2's performance issues without sacrificing its
advantages over BBR. To this end, BBRv2+ incorporates delay information into
its path model, which cautiously guides the aggressiveness of its bandwidth
probing to not reduce its fairness against loss-based CCAs. BBRv2+ also
integrates mechanisms for improved resilience to random losses as well as
network jitters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BBRv2+.
Especially, it achieves 25% higher throughput and comparable queuing delay in

algebraic convergence rates for regression and solution of PDEs, but require
empirical tuning of training parameters. We enrich POU-Nets with a Gaussian
noise model to obtain a probabilistic generalization amenable to gradient-based
minimization of a maximum likelihood loss. The resulting architecture provides
spatial representations of both noiseless and noisy data as Gaussian mixtures
with closed form expressions for variance which provides an estimator of local
error. The training process yields remarkably sharp partitions of input space
based upon correlation of function values. This classification of training
points is amenable to a hierarchical refinement strategy that significantly
improves the localization of the regression, allowing for higher-order
polynomial approximation to be utilized. The framework scales more favorably to
large data sets as compared to Gaussian process regression and allows for
spatially varying uncertainty, leveraging the expressive power of deep neural
networks while bypassing expensive training associated with other probabilistic
deep learning methods. Compared to standard deep neural networks, the framework
demonstrates hp-convergence without the use of regularizers to tune the
localization of partitions. We provide benchmarks quantifying performance in
high/low-dimensions, demonstrating that convergence rates depend only on the
latent dimension of data within high-dimensional space. Finally, we introduce a

  efficiency in realistic scenarios?",,,,,"cs.DC cs.SY eess.SP eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can supplement the information from
their own sensors with information from surrounding CAVs for decision making
and control. This has the potential to improve traffic efficiency. CAVs face
additional challenges in their driving, however, when they interact with
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in mixed-traffic environments due to the
uncertainty in human's driving behavior e.g. larger reaction times, perception
errors, etc. While a lot of research has investigated the impact of CAVs on
traffic safety and efficiency at different penetration rates, all have assumed
either perfect communication or very simple scenarios with imperfect
communication. In practice, the presence of communication delays and packet
losses means that CAVs might receive only partial information from surrounding
vehicles, and this can have detrimental effects on their performance. This
paper investigates the impact of CAVs on traffic efficiency in realistic
communication and road network scenarios (i.e. imperfect communication and
large-scale road network). We analyze the effect of unreliable communication
links on CAVs operation in mixed traffic with various penetration rates and
evaluate traffic performance in congested traffic scenarios on a large-scale
road network (the M50 motorway, in Ireland). Results show that CAVs can
significantly improve traffic efficiency in congested traffic scenarios at high
penetration rates. The scale of the improvement depends on communication
reliability, with a packet drop rate of 70% leading to an increase in traffic
congestion by 28.7% and 11.88% at 40% and 70% penetration rates respectively
compared to perfect communication.

propagation delays between network nodes are multiples of a time interval. Such
a network can be modeled as a hypergraph together with a matrix specifying the
delays. The link scheduling problem is closely related to the independent sets
of the periodic hypergraph induced by the network model. However, as the
periodic hypergraph has infinitely many vertices, independent sets cannot be
solved efficiently and explicitly using the existing algorithms designed for
generic graphs or hypergraphs. In this paper, a sequence of directed graphs of
a finite size called scheduling graphs are derived to provide an explicit
characterization of the rate region of link scheduling. A collision-free
schedule is equivalent to a path in a scheduling graph, and the rate region is
equal to the convex hull of all the rate vectors associated with the cycles of
a scheduling graph. For a special scheduling graph called the non-overlapping
scheduling graph, a dominance property is studied to further simplify the rate
region characterization, so that both the number and length of the cycles to be

calculating the rate region and maximizing a weighted sum of the scheduling

communication systems as it represents the maximum rate at which information
can be reliably transmitted over a communication channel. Nevertheless, for the
majority of channels, finding a closed-form capacity expression remains an open
challenge. This is because it requires to carry out two formidable tasks a) the
computation of the mutual information between the channel input and output, and
b) its maximization with respect to the signal distribution at the channel
input. In this paper, we address both tasks. Inspired by implicit generative
models, we propose a novel cooperative framework to automatically learn the
channel capacity, for any type of memory-less channel. In particular, we
firstly develop a new methodology to estimate the mutual information directly
from a discriminator typically deployed to train adversarial networks, referred
to as discriminative mutual information estimator (DIME). Secondly, we include
the discriminator in a cooperative channel capacity learning framework,
referred to as CORTICAL, where a discriminator learns to distinguish between
dependent and independent channel input-output samples while a generator learns
to produce the optimal channel input distribution for which the discriminator
exhibits the best performance. Lastly, we prove that a particular choice of the
cooperative value function solves the channel capacity estimation problem.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers high accuracy.

that a chemical species $X$ catalyzes its own formation. From the perspective
of chemical kinetics, autocatalysts show a regime of super-linear growth. Given
a chemical reaction network, however, it is not at all straightforward to
identify species that are autocatalytic in the sense that there is a
sub-network that takes $X$ as input and produces more than one copy of $X$ as
output. The difficulty arises from the need to distinguish autocatalysis e.g.
from the superposition of a cycle that consumes and produces equal amounts of
$X$ and a pathway that produces $X$. To deal with this issue, a number of
competing notions, such as exclusive autocatalysis and autocatalytic cycles,
have been introduced. A closer inspection of concepts and their usage by
different authors shows, however, that subtle differences in the definitions
often makes conceptually matching ideas difficult to bring together formally.
In this contribution we make some of the available approaches comparable by
translating them into a common formal framework that uses integer hyperflows as
a basis to study autocatalysis in large chemical reaction networks. As an
application we investigate the prevalence of autocatalysis in metabolic
networks.

This is illustrated in a 5-machine representation of the Nordic synchronous

errors due to the shrinking transistor sizes and lower power supply. Soft
errors on the AIoT processors particularly the deep learning accelerators
(DLAs) with massive computing may cause substantial computing errors. These
computing errors are difficult to be captured by the conventional training on
general purposed processors like CPUs and GPUs in a server. Applying the
offline trained neural network models to the edge accelerators with errors
directly may lead to considerable prediction accuracy loss.
  To address the problem, we propose a remote retraining framework (R2F) for
remote AIoT processors with computing errors. It takes the remote AIoT
processor with soft errors in the training loop such that the on-site computing
errors can be learned with the application data on the server and the retrained
models can be resilient to the soft errors. Meanwhile, we propose an optimized
partial TMR strategy to enhance the retraining. According to our experiments,
R2F enables elastic design trade-offs between the model accuracy and the
performance penalty. The top-5 model accuracy can be improved by 1.93%-13.73%
with 0%-200% performance penalty at high fault error rate. In addition, we
notice that the retraining requires massive data transmission and even
dominates the training time, and propose a sparse increment compression
approach for the data transmission optimization, which reduces the retraining
time by 38%-88% on average with negligible accuracy loss over a straightforward
remote retraining.

(TDNN). Firstly, we use the SE-Res2Blocks as in ECAPA-TDNN to explicitly model
the channel interdependence to realize adaptive calibration of channel
features, and process local context features in a multi-scale way at a more
granular level compared with conventional TDNN-based methods. Secondly, we
explore to use the encoder structure of Transformer to model the global context
interdependence features at an utterance level which can capture better long

outputs of SE-Res2Blocks and Transformer encoder to leverage the complementary
channel and context interdependence features learned by themself respectively.
Finally, instead of performing a single attentive statistics pooling, we also
find it beneficial to extend the pooling method in a multi-head way which can
discriminate features from multiple aspect. The proposed MACCIF-TDNN

communication and face expression cues, but usually requires a front-facing
camera. Using a frontal camera in a hands-free setting when a person is on the
move is impractical. Even holding a mobile phone camera in the front of the
face while sitting for a long duration is not convenient. To overcome these
issues, we propose a low-cost wearable egocentric camera setup that can be
integrated into smart glasses. Our goal is to mimic a classical video call, and
therefore, we transform the egocentric perspective of this camera into a front
facing video. To this end, we employ a conditional generative adversarial
neural network that learns a transition from the highly distorted egocentric
views to frontal views common in videoconferencing. Our approach learns to
transfer expression details directly from the egocentric view without using a
complex intermediate parametric expressions model, as it is used by related
face reenactment methods. We successfully handle subtle expressions, not easily
captured by parametric blendshape-based solutions, e.g., tongue movement, eye
movements, eye blinking, strong expressions and depth varying movements. To get
control over the rigid head movements in the target view, we condition the
generator on synthetic renderings of a moving neutral face. This allows us to
synthesis results at different head poses. Our technique produces temporally
smooth video-realistic renderings in real-time using a video-to-video
translation network in conjunction with a temporal discriminator. We
demonstrate the improved capabilities of our technique by comparing against
related state-of-the art approaches.

remarkably different from the exocentric view. Thus, transforming the
appearances across the two different views is a non-trivial task. Particularly,
we propose a novel Bi-directional Spatial Temporal Attention Fusion Generative
Adversarial Network (STA-GAN) to learn both spatial and temporal information to
generate egocentric video sequences from the exocentric view. The proposed
STA-GAN consists of three parts: temporal branch, spatial branch, and attention
fusion. First, the temporal and spatial branches generate a sequence of fake
frames and their corresponding features. The fake frames are generated in both
downstream and upstream directions for both temporal and spatial branches.
Next, the generated four different fake frames and their corresponding features
(spatial and temporal branches in two directions) are fed into a novel
multi-generation attention fusion module to produce the final video sequence.
Meanwhile, we also propose a novel temporal and spatial dual-discriminator for
more robust network optimization. Extensive experiments on the Side2Ego and
Top2Ego datasets show that the proposed STA-GAN significantly outperforms the

accurately predict the geometrical information of NPB. In this work, the

Such full-wave modal technique has been applied for the rigorous analysis of
the excitation of a microwave cavity with an axion field. In this scenario, the
electromagnetic field generated by the axion-photon coupling can be assumed to
be driven by equivalent electrical charge and current densities. These
densities have been inserted in the general BI-RME 3D equations, which express
the RF electromagnetic field existing within a cavity as an integral involving
the Dyadic Green functions of the cavity (under Coulomb gauge) as well as such
densities. This method is able to take into account any arbitrary spatial and
temporal variation of both magnitude and phase of the axion field. Next, we
have obtained a simple network driven by the axion current source, which
represents the coupling between the axion field and the resonant modes of the
cavity. With this approach, it is possible to calculate the extracted and
dissipated RF power as a function of frequency along a broad band and without
Cauchy-Lorentz approximations, obtaining the spectrum of the electromagnetic
field generated in the cavity, and dealing with modes relatively close to the
axion resonant mode. Moreover, with this technique we have a complete knowledge
of the signal extracted from the cavity, not only in magnitude but also in
phase. This can be an interesting issue for future analysis where the axion
phase is an important parameter.

It is very challenging
to classify a large and heterogeneous collection of data, which require
improved information processing methods to organize text. To classify large
size of corpus, one common approach is to use hierarchical text classification,
which aims to classify textual data in a hierarchical structure. Several
approaches have been proposed to tackle classification of text but most of the
research has been done on English language. This paper proposes a deep learning
model for hierarchical text classification of news in Urdu language -
consisting of 51,325 sentences from 8 online news websites belonging to the
following genres: Sports; Technology; and Entertainment. The objectives of this
paper are twofold: (1) to develop a large human-annotated dataset of news in
Urdu language for hierarchical text classification; and (2) to classify Urdu
news hierarchically using our proposed model based on LSTM mechanism named as
Hierarchical Multi-layer LSTMs (HMLSTM). Our model consists of two modules:
Text Representing Layer, for obtaining text representation in which we use
Word2vec embedding to transform the words to vector and Urdu Hierarchical LSTM
Layer (UHLSTML) an end-to-end fully connected deep LSTMs network to perform
automatic feature learning, we train one LSTM layer for each level of the class
hierarchy. We have performed extensive experiments on our self created dataset
named as Urdu News Dataset for Hierarchical Text Classification (UNDHTC). The
result shows that our proposed method is very effective for hierarchical text
classification and it outperforms baseline methods significantly and also
achieved good results as compare to deep neural model.

analysis is often achieved using event-based synchronisation techniques.
However, these techniques lack precise event generation and accuracy. An

event-based synchronisation technique based on a magnetic field, which allows
sub-sample accuracy. A setup featuring Shimmer3 inertial measurement units is
designed to test the approach. The proposed technique shows to be able to
synchronise with a maximum offset of below 2.6~ms with sensors measuring at

The investigated parameters suggest a required synchronisation time of eight
seconds. Further research should investigate the temperature changes that the
sensors are exposed to during human motion analysis and their influence on the
internal time measurement of the sensors. In addition, the approach should be
tested using inertial measurement units from different manufacturers to
investigate an identified constant offset in the accuracy measurements.

particle power exchange, where each individual wave belonging to the whistler

a simple polygonal domain that contains one vertex v, and whose boundary can be

particular, a digon-tailoring cuts off from P a digon containing v, a subset of
P bounded by two equal-length geodesic segments that share endpoints, and can
then zip closed.
  In the first part of this monograph, we primarily study properties of the
tailoring operation on convex polyhedra. We show that P can be reshaped to any
polyhedral convex surface Q a subset of conv(P) by a sequence of tailorings.
This investigation uncovered previously unexplored topics, including a notion
of unfolding of Q onto P--cutting up Q into pieces pasted non-overlapping onto
P, and to continuously folding P onto Q.
  In the second part of this monograph, we study vertex-merging processes on
convex polyhedra (each vertex-merge being in a sense the reverse of a
digon-tailoring), creating embeddings of P into enlarged surfaces. We aim to
produce non-overlapping polyhedral and planar unfoldings, which led us to
develop an apparently new theory of convex sets, and of minimal length
enclosing polygons, on convex polyhedra.
  All our theorem proofs are constructive, implying polynomial-time algorithms.

and Winskel, and the weighted relational models of linear logic studied by
Laird, Manzonetto, McCusker and Pagani. More precisely, we show that there is
an interpretationpreserving ""collapse"" functor from the former to the latter.
On objects, the functor defines for each game a set of possible execution
states. Defining the action on morphisms is more subtle, and this is the main
contribution of the paper. Given a strategy and an execution state, our functor
needs to count the witnesses for this state within the strategy. Strategies in
thin concurrent games describe non-linear behaviour explicitly, so in general
each witness exists in countably many symmetric copies. The challenge is to
define the right notion of witnesses, factoring out this infinity while
matching the weighted relational model. Understanding how witnesses compose is
particularly subtle and requires a delve into the combinatorics of witnesses
and their symmetries. In its basic form, this functor connects thin concurrent
games and a relational model weighted by N $\cup$ {+$\infty$}. We will
additionally consider a generalised setting where both models are weighted by
elements of an arbitrary continuous semiring; this covers the probabilistic
case, among others. Witnesses now additionally carry a value from the semiring,
and our interpretation-preserving collapse functor extends to this setting.

linear codes in code-based cryptography. This is a new attempt to exploit
Gabidulin codes in the McEliece setting and almost all the previous
cryptosystems of this type have been completely or partially broken. To be
specific, we introduce the so-called semilinear transformation in coding
theory, which is defined through an $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear automorphism of
$\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, then apply them to construct a public key encryption
scheme. Our analysis shows that this scheme can resist all the existing
distinguisher attacks, such as Overbeck's attack and Coggia-Couvreur attack.
Meanwhile, we endow the underlying Gabidulin code with the so-called partial
cyclic structure to reduce the public key size. Compared with some other
code-based cryptosystems, our proposal has a much more compact representation
of public keys. For instance, 2592 bytes are enough for our proposal to achieve
the security of 256 bits, almost 403 times smaller than that of Classic

information (e.g., attributes) to recognize the seen and unseen samples, where
unseen classes are not observable during training. It is natural to derive
generative models and hallucinate training samples for unseen classes based on
the knowledge learned from the seen samples. However, most of these models
suffer from the `generation shifts', where the synthesized samples may drift
from the real distribution of unseen data. In this paper, we conduct an
in-depth analysis on this issue and propose a novel Generation Shifts
Mitigating Flow (GSMFlow) framework, which is comprised of multiple conditional
affine coupling layers for learning unseen data synthesis efficiently and
effectively. In particular, we identify three potential problems that trigger
the generation shifts, i.e., semantic inconsistency, variance decay, and
structural permutation and address them respectively. First, to reinforce the
correlations between the generated samples and the respective attributes, we
explicitly embed the semantic information into the transformations in each of
the coupling layers. Second, to recover the intrinsic variance of the
synthesized unseen features, we introduce a visual perturbation strategy to
diversify the intra-class variance of generated data and hereby help adjust the
decision boundary of the classifier. Third, to avoid structural permutation in
the semantic space, we propose a relative positioning strategy to manipulate
the attribute embeddings, guiding which to fully preserve the inter-class
geometric structure. Experimental results demonstrate that GSMFlow achieves
state-of-the-art recognition performance in both conventional and generalized
zero-shot settings. Our code is available at:

generate images with foregrounds and backgrounds that are mutually independent

constraint and achieving superior diversity. It also provides excellent
flexibility by allowing the same foreground object with different background
scenes, the same background scene with varying foreground objects, or the same
foreground object and background scene with different object positions, sizes
and poses. It can compose foreground objects and background scenes sampled from
different datasets as well. Extensive experiments over multiple datasets show
that FBC-GAN achieves competitive visual realism and superior diversity as

high-permeability magnetic shielding, particularly when they are close to the
shield's surface. Here, we present an efficient design methodology for creating
desired static magnetic field profiles by using discrete coils
electromagnetically-coupled to a cylindrical passive magnetic shield. We
utilize a modified Green's function solution that accounts for the interior
boundary conditions on a closed finite-length high-permeability cylindrical
magnetic shield, and determine simplified expressions when a cylindrical coil
approaches the interior surface of the shield. We use an analytic formulation
of simple discrete building blocks to provide a complete discrete coil basis to
generate any physically-attainable magnetic field inside the shield. We then
use a genetic algorithm to find optimized discrete coil structures composed of
this basis. We use our methodology to generate an improved linear axial
gradient field, $\mathrm{d}B_z/\mathrm{d}z$, and transverse bias field, $B_x$.
These optimized structures increase, by a factor of seven and three compared to
the standard configurations, the volume in which the desired and achieved
fields agree within $1\%$ accuracy, respectively. This coil design method can
be used to optimize active--passive magnetic field shaping systems that are
compact and simple to manufacture, enabling accurate magnetic field control in
spatially-confined experiments at low cost.

$f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that depends on all its input variables, when
represented as a real-valued multivariate polynomial $P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, has
degree at least $\log n - O(\log \log n)$. This was improved to a tight $(\log
n - O(1))$ bound by Chiarelli, Hatami and Saks (Combinatorica 2020). Similar
statements are also known for other Boolean function complexity measures such
as Sensitivity (Simon (FCT 1983)), Quantum query complexity, and Approximate
degree (Ambainis and de Wolf (CC 2014)).
  In this paper, we address this question for \emph{Probabilistic degree}. The
function $f$ has probabilistic degree at most $d$ if there is a random
real-valued polynomial of degree at most $d$ that agrees with $f$ at each input
with high probability. Our understanding of this complexity measure is
significantly weaker than those above: for instance, we do not even know the
probabilistic degree of the OR function, the best-known bounds put it between
$(\log n)^{1/2-o(1)}$ and $O(\log n)$ (Beigel, Reingold, Spielman (STOC 1991);
Tarui (TCS 1993); Harsha, Srinivasan (RSA 2019)).
  Here we can give a near-optimal understanding of the probabilistic degree of
$n$-variate functions $f$, \emph{modulo} our lack of understanding of the
probabilistic degree of OR. We show that if the probabilistic degree of OR is
$(\log n)^c$, then the minimum possible probabilistic degree of such an $f$ is
at least $(\log n)^{c/(c+1)-o(1)}$, and we show this is tight up to $(\log
n)^{o(1)}$ factors.

Little to no attention has been paid to the selection strategies and how they
would affect model performance. In this work, we present a study on training
instance selection in few-shot neural text generation. The selection decision
is made based only on the unlabeled data so as to identify the most worthwhile
data points that should be annotated under some budget of labeling cost. Based
on the intuition that the few-shot training instances should be diverse and
representative of the entire data distribution, we propose a simple selection
strategy with K-means clustering. We show that even with the naive
clustering-based approach, the generation models consistently outperform random
sampling on three text generation tasks: data-to-text generation, document
summarization and question generation. We hope that this work will call for

positions of objects. To tackle these issues, we propose HIDA, a lightweight
assistive system based on 3D point cloud instance segmentation with a
solid-state LiDAR sensor, for holistic indoor detection and avoidance. Our
entire system consists of three hardware components, two interactive
functions~(obstacle avoidance and object finding) and a voice user interface.
Based on voice guidance, the point cloud from the most recent state of the
changing indoor environment is captured through an on-site scanning performed
by the user. In addition, we design a point cloud segmentation model with dual
lightweight decoders for semantic and offset predictions, which satisfies the
efficiency of the whole system. After the 3D instance segmentation, we
post-process the segmented point cloud by removing outliers and projecting all
points onto a top-view 2D map representation. The system integrates the
information above and interacts with users intuitively by acoustic feedback.
The proposed 3D instance segmentation model has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on ScanNet v2 dataset. Comprehensive field tests with various tasks
in a user study verify the usability and effectiveness of our system for

activities an agent may be interested in engaging in, namely, seeing

is that data is collected by an agent observing or intervening in a system
(layers 1 and 2), while its goal may be to understand what would have happened
had it taken a different course of action, contrary to what factually ended up
happening (layer 3). While there exists a solid understanding of the conditions
under which cross-layer inferences are allowed from observations to
interventions, the results are somewhat scarcer when targeting counterfactual
quantities. In this paper, we study the identification of nested
counterfactuals from an arbitrary combination of observations and experiments.
Specifically, building on a more explicit definition of nested counterfactuals,
we prove the counterfactual unnesting theorem (CUT), which allows one to map
arbitrary nested counterfactuals to unnested ones. For instance, applications
in mediation and fairness analysis usually evoke notions of direct, indirect,
and spurious effects, which naturally require nesting. Second, we introduce a
sufficient and necessary graphical condition for counterfactual identification
from an arbitrary combination of observational and experimental distributions.
Lastly, we develop an efficient and complete algorithm for identifying nested
counterfactuals; failure of the algorithm returning an expression for a query

this way, contains a surface term and a remainder, in addition to the canonical
kinetic and potential terms. The surface term describes possible flux
contributions in the presence of boundaries, while the remainder describes
additional interactions, that can't be absorbed in a redefinition of the
canonical terms. It is, however, through its combination with the surface term
that the noise fields can be recovered, in all cases. However their identities
can be subject to anomalies. What is of particular, practical, interest is the
identification of the noise fields, as functions of the scalars, whose
correlation functions are Gaussian. This implies new identities, between the
scalars, that can be probed in real, or computer, experiments.

triangle with all three medians being rational, and it is a longstanding
conjecture that no such triangle exists. However, Buchholz and Rathbun showed
that there are infinitely many Heron triangles with two rational medians, an
infinite subset of which are associated with rational points on an elliptic

explicit formulae for the integer side lengths, the two rational medians, and
the area in this infinite family of Heron triangles. The proof uses a combined
approach to Somos-5 sequences and associated Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT)

carries a wealth of information on the coupling of primary photoexcitations
with their dynamic environment as well as between multi-particles. In the limit
in which inhomogeneous broadening dominates the total optical linewidths, the
inhomogeneous and homogeneous contributions can be rigorously separated by
temperature-dependent %linear spectral measurements such as steady-state
photoluminescence spectroscopy. This is possible because the only
temperature-dependent phenomenon is optical dephasing, which defines the
homogeneous linewidth, since this process is mediated by scattering with
phonons. However, if the homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths are
comparable, as is the case in hybrid Ruddlesden-Popper metal halides, the
temperature dependence of linear spectral measurement \emph{cannot} separate
rigorously the homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions to the total
linewidth because the lineshape does \emph{not} contain purely Lorentzian
components that can be isolated by varying the temperature. Furthermore, the
inhomogeneous contribution to the steady-state photoluminescence lineshape is
not necessarily temperature independent if driven by diffusion-limited
processes, particularly if measured by photoluminescence. Nonlinear coherent
optical spectroscopies, on the other hand, do permit separation of homogeneous
and inhomogeneous line broadening contributions in all regimes of
inhomogeneity. Consequently, these offer insights into the nature of many-body
interactions that are entirely inaccessible to temperature-dependent linear
spectroscopies. When applied to Ruddlesden-Popper metal halides, these
techniques have indeed enabled us to quantitatively assess the exciton-phonon

core position, primary energy and composition of showers with these specific
geometries, remain to be developed. Towards that goal, we present a new
reconstruction procedure based on the arrival times and the amplitudes of the

reconstruct the radio emission zone as a fixed point along the shower axis.

through an Angular Distribution Function (ADF) taking into account at once all
geo-magnetic asymmetries and early late effects as well as additional signal
asymmetries featured by very inclined EAS. This method shows promising results

the major challenges in the supervised learning approaches is expressing and
collecting the rich knowledge that experts have with respect to the meaning
present in the image data. Towards this, typically a fixed set of labels is
specified and experts are tasked with annotating the pixels, patches or
segments in the images with the given labels. In general, however, the set of
classes does not fully capture the rich semantic information present in the
images. For example, in medical imaging such as histology images, the different
parts of cells could be grouped and sub-grouped based on the expertise of the
pathologist.
  To achieve such a precise semantic representation of the concepts in the
image, we need access to the full depth of knowledge of the annotator. In this
work, we develop a novel approach to collect segmentation annotations from
experts based on psychometric testing. Our method consists of the psychometric
testing procedure, active query selection, query enhancement, and a deep metric
learning model to achieve a patch-level image embedding that allows for
semantic segmentation of images. We show the merits of our method with

conditions found in previously explored, large path-length whispering gallery
resonators are absent. Nonetheless, for cross-polarized scattering a strong and
broadband suppression of one side-band is observed. This arises due to an
interference between the Faraday and second-order Cotton-Mouton effects. To
fully account for the suppression of the cross-polarized scattering, it is
necessary to consider the squeezing of magnon modes intrinsic to thin-film
geometry. A co-polarized scattering due to Cotton-Mouton effect is also
observed. In addition, the magnon modes involved are identified as
Damon-Eshbach surface modes, whose non-reciprocal propagation could be
exploited in devices applications. This work experimentally demonstrates the
important role of second order Cotton-Mouton effect for optomagnonic devices.

keypoint localization. Most existing methods pursue the spatial accuracy
through learning the high-resolution (HR) representation from input images. By
the experimental analysis, we find that the HR representation leads to a sharp
increase of computational cost, while the accuracy improvement remains marginal
compared with the low-resolution (LR) representation. In this paper, we propose
a design paradigm for cost-effective network with LR representation for
efficient pose estimation, named FasterPose. Whereas the LR design largely
shrinks the model complexity, yet how to effectively train the network with
respect to the spatial accuracy is a concomitant challenge. We study the
training behavior of FasterPose, and formulate a novel regressive cross-entropy
(RCE) loss function for accelerating the convergence and promoting the
accuracy. The RCE loss generalizes the ordinary cross-entropy loss from the
binary supervision to a continuous range, thus the training of pose estimation
network is able to benefit from the sigmoid function. By doing so, the output
heatmap can be inferred from the LR features without loss of spatial accuracy,
while the computational cost and model size has been significantly reduced.
Compared with the previously dominant network of pose estimation, our method
reduces 58% of the FLOPs and simultaneously gains 1.3% improvement of accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that FasterPose yields promising results on the
common benchmarks, i.e., COCO and MPII, consistently validating the
effectiveness and efficiency for practical utilization, especially the
low-latency and low-energy-budget applications in the non-GPU scenarios.

  Answering",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a multi-modal challenging task
widely considered by research communities of the computer vision and natural
language processing. Since most current medical VQA models focus on visual
content, ignoring the importance of text, this paper proposes a multi-view
attention-based model(MuVAM) for medical visual question answering which
integrates the high-level semantics of medical images on the basis of text
description. Firstly, different methods are utilized to extract the features of
the image and the question for the two modalities of vision and text. Secondly,
this paper proposes a multi-view attention mechanism that include
Image-to-Question (I2Q) attention and Word-to-Text (W2T) attention. Multi-view
attention can correlate the question with image and word in order to better
analyze the question and get an accurate answer. Thirdly, a composite loss is
presented to predict the answer accurately after multi-modal feature fusion and
improve the similarity between visual and textual cross-modal features. It
consists of classification loss and image-question complementary (IQC) loss.
Finally, for data errors and missing labels in the VQA-RAD dataset, we
collaborate with medical experts to correct and complete this dataset and then
construct an enhanced dataset, VQA-RADPh. The experiments on these two datasets
show that the effectiveness of MuVAM surpasses the state-of-the-art method.

  Models",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Gaussian process (GP) model based optimization is widely applied in
simulation and machine learning. In general, it first estimates a GP model
based on a few observations from the true response and then employs this model
to guide the search, aiming to quickly locate the global optimum. Despite its
successful applications, it has several limitations that may hinder its broader
usage. First, building an accurate GP model can be difficult and
computationally expensive, especially when the response function is multi-modal
or varies significantly over the design space. Second, even with an appropriate
model, the search process can be trapped in suboptimal regions before moving to
the global optimum due to the excessive effort spent around the current best
solution. In this work, we adopt the Additive Global and Local GP (AGLGP) model
in the optimization framework. The model is rooted in the inducing-points-based
GP sparse approximations and is combined with independent local models in
different regions. With these properties, the AGLGP model is suitable for
multi-modal responses with relatively large data sizes. Based on this AGLGP
model, we propose a Combined Global and Local search for Optimization (CGLO)
algorithm. It first divides the whole design space into disjoint local regions
and identifies a promising region with the global model. Next, a local model in
the selected region is fit to guide detailed search within this region. The
algorithm then switches back to the global step when a good local solution is
found. The global and local natures of CGLO enable it to enjoy the benefits of
both global and local search to efficiently locate the global optimum.

brain regions from both structural and functional aspects and provide a new
means for mental disease analysis. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
become a de facto model for analyzing graph-structured data. However, how to
employ GNNs to extract effective representations from brain networks in
multiple modalities remains rarely explored. Moreover, as brain networks
provide no initial node features, how to design informative node attributes and
leverage edge weights for GNNs to learn is left unsolved. To this end, we
develop a novel multiview GNN for multimodal brain networks. In particular, we
regard each modality as a view for brain networks and employ contrastive
learning for multimodal fusion. Then, we propose a GNN model which takes
advantage of the message passing scheme by propagating messages based on degree
statistics and brain region connectivities. Extensive experiments on two
real-world disease datasets (HIV and Bipolar) demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

enormous research interest due to the great success in realizing exotic
topological quantum states, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE),

states. One key issue in this field is to effectively manipulate these states

transport measurements, we reveal a magnetization-tuned topological quantum
phase transition from Chern insulator to magnetic insulator with gapped Dirac
surface states in MnBi2Te4 devices. Specifically, as the magnetic field is
tilted away from the out-of-plane direction by around 40-60 degrees, the Hall
resistance deviates from the quantization value and a colossal, anisotropic
magnetoresistance is detected. The theoretical analyses based on modified
Landauer-Buttiker formalism show that the field-tilt-driven switching from
ferromagnetic state to canted antiferromagnetic state induces a topological
quantum phase transition from Chern insulator to magnetic insulator with gapped
Dirac surface states in MnBi2Te4 devices. Our work provides an efficient means

typically very scarce, making these deep models prone to overfit the training
data. Studies showed that knowledge distillation (KD), especially the
mean-teacher framework which is more robust to perturbations, can help mitigate
the over-fitting effect. However, directly transferring KD from computer vision
to medical image classification yields inferior performance as medical images
suffer from higher intra-class variance and class imbalance. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Categorical Relation-preserving Contrastive
Knowledge Distillation (CRCKD) algorithm, which takes the commonly used
mean-teacher model as the supervisor. Specifically, we propose a novel
Class-guided Contrastive Distillation (CCD) module to pull closer positive
image pairs from the same class in the teacher and student models, while
pushing apart negative image pairs from different classes. With this
regularization, the feature distribution of the student model shows higher
intra-class similarity and inter-class variance. Besides, we propose a
Categorical Relation Preserving (CRP) loss to distill the teacher's relational
knowledge in a robust and class-balanced manner. With the contribution of the
CCD and CRP, our CRCKD algorithm can distill the relational knowledge more
comprehensively. Extensive experiments on the HAM10000 and APTOS datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CRCKD method.

The NP certificates are solutions of simple equations involving relations over

predicting their levels based on environmental parameters as well as to
investigate their relationships with environmental stressors. Gradient Boosting

to predict $E.\ Coli$ and enterococci values based on environmental features.
The evaluation of stability and generalizability with 10-fold cross validation

performed best with R$^2$ values of 0.71 and 0.68 for predicting $E.\ Coli$ and

exhibit biases and variability that cannot be explained on the basis of sound,
Bayesian manipulations of probability. This is especially salient when beliefs
are updated as a function of sequential observations. We introduce a
theoretical framework in which biases and variability emerge from a trade-off
between Bayesian inference and a cognitive cost of carrying out probabilistic
computations. We consider two forms of the cost: a precision cost and an
unpredictability cost; these penalize beliefs that are less entropic and less
deterministic, respectively. We apply our framework to the case of a Bernoulli
variable: the bias of a coin is inferred from a sequence of coin flips.
Theoretical predictions are qualitatively different depending on the form of
the cost. A precision cost induces overestimation of small probabilities on
average and a limited memory of past observations, and, consequently, a
fluctuating bias. An unpredictability cost induces underestimation of small
probabilities and a fixed bias that remains appreciable even for nearly
unbiased observations. The case of a fair (equiprobable) coin, however, is
singular, with non-trivial and slow fluctuations of the inferred bias. The
proposed framework of costly Bayesian inference illustrates the richness of a
'resource-rational' (or 'bounded-rational') picture of seemingly irrational
human cognition.

behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Directional derivatives of SRB measure
densities conditioned on unstable manifolds are critical in the sensitivity
analysis of hyperbolic chaos. These derivatives, known as the SRB density
gradients, are by-products of the regularization of Lebesgue integrals
appearing in the original linear response expression. In this paper, we propose
a novel trajectory-driven algorithm for computing the SRB density gradient
defined for systems with high-dimensional unstable manifolds. We apply the
concept of measure preservation together with the chain rule on smooth
manifolds. Due to the recursive one-step nature of our derivations, the
proposed procedure is memory-efficient and can be naturally integrated with
existing Monte Carlo schemes widely used in computational chaotic dynamics. We
numerically show the exponential convergence of our scheme, analyze the

the field of VOAs in the last 15 years which is based on fruitful analogies and

over two test campaigns for continuous durations of over 700 h and 1360 h,

the sum throughput of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless
powered communication network (WPCN). Specifically, the IRS phase-shift vectors
across time and resource allocation are jointly optimized to enhance the
efficiencies of both downlink wireless power transfer (DL WPT) and uplink
wireless information transmission (UL WIT) between a hybrid access point (HAP)
and multiple wirelessly powered devices. To this end, we first study three
special cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming,namely user-adaptive IRS
beamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming,by
characterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing
corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the
latter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of
IRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required
for UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization
framework for dynamic IRS beamforming, which is applicable for any given number
of IRS phase-shift vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the
general problem with highly coupled optimization variables, we propose two
algorithms to solve it and particularly, the low-complexity algorithm exploits
the intrinsic structure of the optimal solution as well as the solutions to the
cases with user-adaptive and static IRS beamforming. Simulation results
validate our theoretical findings, illustrate the practical significance of IRS
with dynamic beamforming for spectral and energy efficient WPCNs, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark
schemes.

easy to show that if the second moment of the length distribution is finite

Our main contribution is a sufficient condition on the length distribution
which guarantees that $\mathcal{S}^v$ percolates for all $v>0$ if $d \geq 5$.
E.g., if the probability mass function of the length distribution is $ m(\ell)=
c \cdot \ln(\ln(\ell))^{\varepsilon}/ (\ell^3 \ln(\ell)) 1[\ell \geq \ell_0] $
for some $\ell_0>e^e$ and $\varepsilon>0$ then $\mathcal{S}^v$ percolates for

Poisson Boolean model, ellipses percolation, etc.), we define a natural family

intervene through a set of stochastic expert policies. The agent interacts with
the environment over episodes, with each episode having different context
distributions; this results in the `best expert' changing across episodes. Our
goal is to develop an agent that tracks the best expert over episodes. We
introduce the Empirical Divergence-based UCB (ED-UCB) algorithm in this setting
where the agent does not have any knowledge of the expert policies or changes
in context distributions. With mild assumptions, we show that bootstrapping
from $\mathcal{O}(N\log(NT^2\sqrt{E}))$ samples results in a regret of
$\mathcal{O}(E(N+1) + \frac{N\sqrt{E}}{T^2})$ for $N$ experts over $E$
episodes, each of length $T$. If the expert policies are known to the agent a
priori, then we can improve the regret to $\mathcal{O}(EN)$ without requiring
any bootstrapping. Our analysis also tightens pre-existing logarithmic regret
bounds to a problem-dependent constant in the non-episodic setting when expert
policies are known. We finally empirically validate our findings through
simulations.

binary SB 744 revealed strong lines of fluorine and lead in the optical
spectrum of the sdOB star and subsolar metallicity in the G1V companion. With
high-quality observations and Gaia astrometric data, we aim at measuring the
chemical composition and Galactic kinematics of the system to put it in context
with known populations of hot subdwarfs. Such binary systems have high
potential, as they give insights into the late stages of binary evolution as
well as into the mysterious formation of stripped core helium-burning stars. We
have analyzed the optical spectra with homogeneous atmospheric models to derive
surface parameters of the binary members from a direct wavelength space
decomposition and independently measured the atmospheric properties of the cool
companion. The two independent methods reached consistent results, which,
amended with constraints from spectral energy distributions provided a subdwarf
mass. The Gaia astrometry allowed us to derive the Galactic kinematics of the
system. SB 744 turned out to be an old, Population II system, that has gone
through dramatic events. The hot subdwarf star belongs to the heavy-metal
subclass of sdOB stars and we report super-solar abundances of lead, based on
Pb III/IV lines. The He abundance of the hot subdwarf is the lowest among the
known heavy-metal sdOB stars. The presence of fluorine implies that SB 744 was
once a hierarchical triple system and the inner binary has merged in the near
past. As an alternative scenario, single-star evolution through late core
helium flash and atmospheric mixing can also produce the observed fluorine
abundances. The atmospheric metal over-abundances currently observed are
perhaps the results of a combination of mixing processes during formation and
radiative support.

dependency trees. The sum of the distances between syntactically related words
has been in the limelight for the past decades. Research on dependency
distances led to the formulation of the principle of dependency distance
minimization whereby words in sentences are ordered so as to minimize that sum.
Numerous random baselines have been defined to carry out related quantitative
studies on languages. The simplest random baseline is the expected value of the
sum in unconstrained random permutations of the words in the sentence, namely
when all the shufflings of the words of a sentence are allowed and equally
likely. Here we focus on a popular baseline: random projective permutations of
the words of the sentence, that is, permutations where the syntactic dependency
structure is projective, a formal constraint that sentences satisfy often in
languages. Thus far, the expectation of the sum of dependency distances in
random projective shufflings of a sentence has been estimated approximately
with a Monte Carlo procedure whose cost is of the order of $Rn$, where $n$ is
the number of words of the sentence and $R$ is the number of samples; it is
well known that the larger $R$, the lower the error of the estimation but the
larger the time cost. Here we present formulae to compute that expectation
without error in time of the order of $n$. Furthermore, we show that star trees
maximize it, and give an algorithm to retrieve the trees that minimize it.

  journal",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to task-oriented
dialogue systems by using latent actions to solve shortcomings of supervised
learning (SL). In this paper, we propose a multi-domain task-oriented dialogue
system, called Dialogue System with Optimizing a Recurrent Action Policy using
Efficient Context (DORA), that uses SL, with subsequently applied RL to
optimize dialogue systems using a recurrent dialogue policy. This dialogue
policy recurrently generates explicit system actions as a both word-level and
high-level policy. As a result, DORA is clearly optimized during both SL and RL
steps by using an explicit system action policy that considers an efficient
context instead of the entire dialogue history. The system actions are both
interpretable and controllable, whereas the latent actions are not. DORA
improved the success rate by 6.6 points on MultiWOZ 2.0 and by 10.9 points on
MultiWOZ 2.1.

  mitogenomes",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA profiles have been used as evidence in
courts for decades, yet the problem of evaluating the weight of evidence has
not been adequately resolved. Both are lineage markers (inherited from just one
parent), which presents different interpretation challenges compared with
standard autosomal DNA profiles (inherited from both parents), for which
recombination increases profile diversity and weakens the effects of
relatedness. We review approaches to the evaluation of lineage marker profiles
for forensic identification, focussing on the key roles of profile mutation
rate and relatedness. Higher mutation rates imply fewer individuals matching
the profile of an alleged contributor, but they will be more closely related.
This makes it challenging to evaluate the possibility that one of these
matching individuals could be the true source, because relatedness may make
them more plausible alternative contributors than less-related individuals, and
they may not be well mixed in the population. These issues reduce the
usefulness of profile databases drawn from a broad population: the larger the
population, the lower the profile relative frequency because of lower
relatedness with the alleged contributor. Many evaluation methods do not
adequately take account of relatedness, but its effects have become more
pronounced with the latest generation of high-mutation-rate Y profiles.

between information and need. Activities of finding (and re-finding) move from
a current need toward information while activities of keeping move from
encountered information toward anticipated need. Meta-level activities such as
maintaining, organizing, and managing the flow of information focus on the
mapping itself. Tools and techniques of PIM can promote information integration
with benefits for each kind of PIM activity and across the life cycle of

to consider for the lower limb analysis. Two statistical femur models were
created from our in-house dataset and a publicly available dataset. Both were
evaluated in terms of average point-to-point surface distance error and through
the mechanical axis of the femur. Furthermore, the clinical impact of using
landmarks on the skin in replacement of bony landmarks is investigated. The
predicted proximal femurs from bony landmarks were more accurate compared to
on-skin landmarks while both had less than 3.5 degrees mechanical axis angle
deviation error. The results regarding the non-invasive determination of the
mechanical axis are very encouraging and could open very interesting clinical
perspectives for the analysis of the lower limb either for orthopedics or

that it agrees with newly derived analytic formulas for the cross-sections in

microscopy, we demonstrate that the local reconstruction and ionization of SV

bonds and thus the quenching of in-gap states, which can be achieved by mild
thermal annealing or STM tip manipulation. SV exhibits a strong and symmetric
Friedel oscillation (FO) pattern, while $\mathrm{SV}^-$ shows an asymmetric FO
pattern with local perturbation amplitude reduced by one order of magnitude and
a faster decay rate. The enhanced passivation by forming $\mathrm{SV}^-$ can be
attributed to its weak dipole-like perturbation, consistent with
density-functional theory and numerical calculations. Therefore,
self-passivated $\mathrm{SV}^-$ is electronically benign and acts as a much
weaker scattering center, which may hold the key to further enhance the charge
mobility of BP and its analogs.

text-to-speech (VAENAR-TTS) model. The autoregressive TTS (AR-TTS) models based
on the sequence-to-sequence architecture can generate high-quality speech, but
their sequential decoding process can be time-consuming. Recently,
non-autoregressive TTS (NAR-TTS) models have been shown to be more efficient
with the parallel decoding process. However, these NAR-TTS models rely on
phoneme-level durations to generate a hard alignment between the text and the
spectrogram. Obtaining duration labels, either through forced alignment or
knowledge distillation, is cumbersome. Furthermore, hard alignment based on
phoneme expansion can degrade the naturalness of the synthesized speech. In
contrast, the proposed model of VAENAR-TTS is an end-to-end approach that does
not require phoneme-level durations. The VAENAR-TTS model does not contain
recurrent structures and is completely non-autoregressive in both the training
and inference phases. Based on the VAE architecture, the alignment information
is encoded in the latent variable, and attention-based soft alignment between
the text and the latent variable is used in the decoder to reconstruct the
spectrogram. Experiments show that VAENAR-TTS achieves state-of-the-art
synthesis quality, while the synthesis speed is comparable with other NAR-TTS
models.

hydrogen are so strong to be in a nonlinear regime: when progressively
increasing the mass of hydrogen from protium to infinity (classical limit), the
volume firstly expands and then contracts, with a maximum slightly above the
mass of tritium. We observe an anharmonic renormalization of about 10% in the
bending and stretching phonon frequencies probed in IR and Raman experiments.

compress speech, music and general audio at bitrates normally targeted by
speech-tailored codecs. SoundStream relies on a model architecture composed by
a fully convolutional encoder/decoder network and a residual vector quantizer,
which are trained jointly end-to-end. Training leverages recent advances in
text-to-speech and speech enhancement, which combine adversarial and
reconstruction losses to allow the generation of high-quality audio content
from quantized embeddings. By training with structured dropout applied to
quantizer layers, a single model can operate across variable bitrates from
3kbps to 18kbps, with a negligible quality loss when compared with models
trained at fixed bitrates. In addition, the model is amenable to a low latency
implementation, which supports streamable inference and runs in real time on a
smartphone CPU. In subjective evaluations using audio at 24kHz sampling rate,
SoundStream at 3kbps outperforms Opus at 12kbps and approaches EVS at 9.6kbps.
Moreover, we are able to perform joint compression and enhancement either at
the encoder or at the decoder side with no additional latency, which we
demonstrate through background noise suppression for speech.

Our work connects techniques from domain adaptation and predictive uncertainty
literature, and allows us to predict model accuracy on challenging unseen
distributions without access to labeled data. In the context of distribution
shift, distributional distances are often used to adapt models and improve
their performance on new domains, however accuracy estimation, or other forms
of predictive uncertainty, are often neglected in these investigations. Through
investigating a wide range of established distributional distances, such as
Frechet distance or Maximum Mean Discrepancy, we determine that they fail to
induce reliable estimates of performance under distribution shift. On the other
hand, we find that the difference of confidences (DoC) of a classifier's
predictions successfully estimates the classifier's performance change over a
variety of shifts. We specifically investigate the distinction between
synthetic and natural distribution shifts and observe that despite its
simplicity DoC consistently outperforms other quantifications of distributional
difference. $DoC$ reduces predictive error by almost half ($46\%$) on several
realistic and challenging distribution shifts, e.g., on the ImageNet-Vid-Robust

electrical bias, has played a prominent role in modern condensed matter physics
over much of the subject's history. Appearing variously in classical,
relativistic and quantum guises, it has among other roles contributed to
establishing the band theory of solids, to research on new phases of strongly
interacting electrons, and to the phenomenology of topological condensed
matter. The dissipationless Hall current requires time-reversal symmetry
breaking. For over a century it has either been ascribed to externally applied
magnetic field and referred to as the ordinary Hall effect, or ascribed to
spontaneous non-zero total internal magnetization (ferromagnetism) and referred
to as the anomalous Hall effect. It has not commonly been associated with
antiferromagnetic order. More recently, however, theoretical predictions and
experimental observations have identified large Hall effects in some
compensated magnetic crystals, governed by neither of the global
magnetic-dipole symmetry breaking mechanisms mentioned above. The goals of this
article are to systematically organize the present understanding of anomalous
antiferromagnetic materials that generate a non-zero Hall effect, which we will
call anomalous Hall antiferromagnets, and to discuss this class of materials in
a broader fundamental and applied research context. Our motivation in drawing
attention to anomalous Hall antiferromagnets is two-fold. First, since Hall
effects that are not governed by magnetic dipole symmetry breaking are at odds
with the traditional understanding of the phenomenon, the topic deserves
attention on its own. Second, this new reincarnation has again placed the Hall
effect in the middle of an emerging field of physics at the intersection of
multipole magnetism, topological condensed matter, and spintronics.

identification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to its ability to obtain
high resolution information about the genes and mechanisms that are causing
resistance and driving pathogen mobility. By contrast, traditional phenotypic
(antibiogram) testing cannot easily elucidate such information. Yet development
of AMR prediction tools from genotype-phenotype data can be biased, since
sampling is non-randomized. Sample provenience, period of collection, and
species representation can confound the association of genetic traits with AMR.
Thus, prediction models can perform poorly on new data with sampling
distribution shifts. In this work -- under an explicit set of causal
assumptions -- we evaluate the effectiveness of propensity-based rebalancing
and confounding adjustment on AMR prediction using genotype-phenotype AMR data
from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC). We select bacterial
genotypes (encoded as k-mer signatures, i.e. DNA fragments of length k),
country, year, species, and AMR phenotypes for the tetracycline drug class,
preparing test data with recent genomes coming from a single country. We test
boosted logistic regression (BLR) and random forests (RF) with/without
bias-handling. On 10,936 instances, we find evidence of species, location and
year imbalance with respect to the AMR phenotype. The crude versus
bias-adjusted change in effect of genetic signatures on AMR varies but only
moderately (selecting the top 20,000 out of 40+ million k-mers). The area under
the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of the RF (0.95) is comparable to
that of BLR (0.94) on both out-of-bag samples from bootstrap and the external

solution of the hydrodynamic problem as a mixed-boundary-value problem in the
whole fluid domain, which we subsequently transform into a system of dual
integral equations. Near a stationary disk, we show that the resulting integral
equation can be reduced into an elementary Abel integral equation that admits a
unique analytical solution. Between two coaxially positioned stationary disks,
we demonstrate that the flow problem can be transformed into a system of two
Fredholm integral equations of the first kind. The latter are solved by means
of numerical approaches. Using our solution, we further investigate the effect
of the disks on the slow rotational motion of a colloidal particle and provide
expressions of the hydrodynamic mobility as a function of the system geometry.
We compare our results with corresponding finite-element simulations and
observe very good agreement.

dominates much of the oceanic spectrum, waves observed in the laboratory are in

allows passive trapping of individual micro-object into the PNJ focusing area

fillers, word fragments, laughter and coughs, etc. are often included. While
common transcriptions do not give special awareness to these phenomena, rich
transcriptions explicitly convert them into special phenomenon tokens as well
as textual tokens. In previous studies, the textual and phenomenon tokens were
simultaneously estimated in an end-to-end manner. However, it is difficult to
build accurate RT-ASR systems because large-scale rich transcription-style
datasets are often unavailable. To solve this problem, our training method uses
a limited rich transcription-style dataset and common transcription-style
dataset simultaneously. The Key process in our semi-supervised learning is to
convert the common transcription-style dataset into a pseudo-rich
transcription-style dataset. To this end, we introduce style tokens which
control phenomenon tokens are generated or not into transformer-based
autoregressive modeling. We use this modeling for generating the pseudo-rich
transcription-style datasets and for building RT-ASR system from the pseudo and

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2005.12401",,,,"cs.LG eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Electricity generation from burning fossil fuels is one of the major
contributors to global warming. Renewable energy sources are a viable
alternative to produce electrical energy and to reduce the emission from the
power industry. These energy sources are the building blocks of green energy,
which all have different characteristics. Their availabilities are also
diverse, depending on geographical locations and other parameters. Low
implementation cost and distributed availability all over the world uplifts
their popularity exponentially. Therefore, it has unlocked opportunities for
consumers to produce electricity locally and use it on-site, which reduces
dependency on centralized utility companies. The research considers two main
objectives: the prediction of wind speed that simplifies wind farm planning and
feasibility study. Secondly, the need to understand the dependency structure of
the wind speeds of multiple distant locations. To address the first objective,
twelve artificial intelligence algorithms were used for wind speed prediction
from collected meteorological parameters. The model performances were compared
to determine the wind speed prediction accuracy. The results show a deep
learning approach, long short-term memory (LSTM) outperforms other models with
the highest accuracy of 97.8%. For dependency, a multivariate cumulative
distribution function, Copula, was used to find the joint distribution of two
or more distant location wind speeds, followed by a case study. We found that
the appropriate copula family and the parameters vary based on the distance in
between. For the case study, Joe-Frank (BB8) copula shows an efficient joint
distribution fit for a wind speed pair with a standard error of 0.0094.
Finally, some insights about the uncertainty aspects of wind speed dependency
were addressed.

where we have little amounts of data. The goal of these methods is to classify
categories that have not been seen before with just a handful of samples.
Recent approaches, such as metric learning, adopt the meta-learning strategy in
which we have episodic tasks conformed by support (training) data and query
(test) data. Metric learning methods have demonstrated that simple models can
achieve good performance by learning a similarity function to compare the
support and the query data. However, the feature space learned by a given
metric learning approach may not exploit the information given by a specific
few-shot task. In this work, we explore the use of dimension reduction
techniques as a way to find task-significant features helping to make better
predictions. We measure the performance of the reduced features by assigning a
score based on the intra-class and inter-class distance, and selecting a
feature reduction method in which instances of different classes are far away
and instances of the same class are close. This module helps to improve the
accuracy performance by allowing the similarity function, given by the metric
learning method, to have more discriminative features for the classification.
Our method outperforms the metric learning baselines in the miniImageNet

Elevations in initially obtained serum lactate levels are strong
predictors of mortality in critically ill patients. Identifying patients whose
serum lactate levels are more likely to increase can alert physicians to
intensify care and guide them in the frequency of tending the blood test. We
investigate whether machine learning models can predict subsequent serum
lactate changes.
  Methods. We investigated serum lactate change prediction using the MIMIC-III
and eICU-CRD datasets in internal as well as external validation of the eICU
cohort on the MIMIC-III cohort. Three subgroups were defined based on the
initial lactate levels: i) normal group (<2 mmol/L), ii) mild group (2-4
mmol/L), and iii) severe group (>4 mmol/L). Outcomes were defined based on
increase or decrease of serum lactate levels between the groups. We also
performed sensitivity analysis by defining the outcome as lactate change of
>10% and furthermore investigated the influence of the time interval between
subsequent lactate measurements on predictive performance.
  Results. The LSTM models were able to predict deterioration of serum lactate
values of MIMIC-III patients with an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.762-0.771) for the
normal group, 0.77 (95% CI 0.768-0.772) for the mild group, and 0.85 (95% CI
0.840-0.851) for the severe group, with a slightly lower performance in the
external validation.
  Conclusion. The LSTM demonstrated good discrimination of patients who had
deterioration in serum lactate levels. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate
whether utilization of a clinical decision support tool based on these results
could positively impact decision-making and patient outcomes.

be related to qubit loss, and define partial identities (which can be

considered. Additionally, decision-makers at theorganizations are not experts
in every domain, so they must continuously acquirevolatile knowledge regarding
such platforms and keep themselves updated.Accordingly, a decision model is
required to analyze the decision criteria usingsystematic identification and
evaluation of potential alternative solutions for adevelopment project. We have
developed a theoretical framework to assist softwareengineers with a set of
Multi-Criteria Decision-Making problems in software production.This study
presents a decision model as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making problem forthe
decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. Weconducted
three industry case studies in the context of three decentralizedautonomous
organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decisionmodel
in assisting decision-makers.

  networks","Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2020",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In an effort to improve user satisfaction and transit image, transit service
providers worldwide offer delay compensations. Smart card data enables the
estimation of passenger delays throughout the network and aid in monitoring
service performance. Notwithstanding, in order to prioritize measures for
improving service reliability and hence reducing passenger delays, it is
paramount to identify the system components - stations and track segments -
where most passenger delay occurs. To this end, we propose a novel method for
estimating network passenger delay from individual trajectories. We decompose
the delay along a passenger trajectory into its corresponding track segment
delay, initial waiting time and transfer delay. We distinguish between two
different types of passenger delay in relation to the public transit network:
average passenger delay and total passenger delay. We employ temporal
clustering on these two quantities to reveal daily and seasonal regularity in
delay patterns of the transit network. The estimation and clustering methods
are demonstrated on one year of data from Washington metro network. The data
consists of schedule information and smart card data which includes
passenger-train assignment of the metro network for the months of August 2017
to August 2018. Our findings show that the average passenger delay is
relatively stable throughout the day. The temporal clustering reveals
pronounced and recurrent and thus predictable daily and weekly patterns with
distinct characteristics for certain months.

environment mainly rely on its first-person observation. This problem has
attracted rising attention in recent years due to its wide application in
autonomous driving, vacuum cleaner, and rescue robot. A navigation agent is
supposed to have various intelligent skills, such as visual perceiving,
mapping, planning, exploring and reasoning, etc. Building such an agent that
observes, thinks, and acts is a key to real intelligence. The remarkable
learning ability of deep learning methods empowered the agents to accomplish
embodied visual navigation tasks. Despite this, embodied visual navigation is
still in its infancy since a lot of advanced skills are required, including
perceiving partially observed visual input, exploring unseen areas, memorizing
and modeling seen scenarios, understanding cross-modal instructions, and
adapting to a new environment, etc. Recently, embodied visual navigation has
attracted rising attention of the community, and numerous works has been
proposed to learn these skills. This paper attempts to establish an outline of
the current works in the field of embodied visual navigation by providing a
comprehensive literature survey. We summarize the benchmarks and metrics,
review different methods, analysis the challenges, and highlight the
state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we discuss unresolved challenges in the
field of embodied visual navigation and give promising directions in pursuing
future research.

separate model for each individual coil, learning and inference with RAKI can
be computationally prohibitive, particularly for large 3D datasets. In this
abstract, we accelerate RAKI more than 200 times by directly learning a
coil-combined target and further improve the reconstruction performance using
joint reconstruction across multiple echoes together with an elliptical-CAIPI
sampling approach. We further deploy these improvements in quantitative imaging
and rapidly obtain T2 and T2* parameter maps from a fast EPTI scan.
