machine-learned replacement for traditional indexes over sorted data, achieving
remarkably fast lookups. Follow-up work focused on explaining RMI's performance
and automatically configuring RMIs through enumeration. Unfortunately,
configuring RMIs involves setting several hyperparameters, the enumeration of
which is often too time-consuming in practice. Therefore, in this work, we
conduct the first inventor-independent broad analysis of RMIs with the goal of
understanding the impact of each hyperparameter on performance. In particular,
we show that in addition to model types and layer size, error bounds and search
algorithms must be considered to achieve the best possible performance. Based
on our findings, we develop a simple-to-follow guideline for configuring RMIs.
We evaluate our guideline by comparing the resulting RMIs with a number of
state-of-the-art indexes, both learned and traditional. We show that our simple
guideline is sufficient to achieve competitive performance with other learned
indexes and RMIs whose configuration was determined using an expensive
enumeration procedure. In addition, while carefully reimplementing RMIs, we are
able to improve the build time by 2.5x to 6.3x.

completely alleviated the need for labeled data, which is cumbersome to collect

practical solution: pre-trained models later fine-tuned on one transfer
language exhibit surprising performance when tested on many target languages.
English is the dominant source language for transfer, as reinforced by popular
zero-shot benchmarks. However, this default choice has not been systematically
vetted. In our study, we compare English against other transfer languages for
fine-tuning, on two pre-trained multilingual models (mBERT and mT5) and
multiple classification and question answering tasks. We find that other
high-resource languages such as German and Russian often transfer more
effectively, especially when the set of target languages is diverse or unknown

automatically translated from English. This finding can have immediate impact
on multilingual zero-shot systems, and should inform future benchmark designs.

most basic classes of geometric graphs. Over the past few decades, a large body
of works studied the (in)tractability of various computational problems on grid
graphs, which often yield substantially faster algorithms than general graphs.
Unfortunately, the recognition of a grid graph is particularly hard -- it was
shown to be NP-hard even on trees of pathwidth 3 already in 1987. Yet, in this
paper, we provide several positive results in this regard in the framework of
parameterized complexity (additionally, we present new and complementary
hardness results). Specifically, our contribution is threefold. First, we show
that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by $k+\mathsf
{mcc}$ where $\mathsf{mcc}$ is the maximum size of a connected component of
$G$. This also implies that the problem is FPT parameterized by $\mathtt{td}+k$
where $\mathtt{td}$ is the treedepth of $G$ (to be compared with the hardness
for pathwidth 2 where $k=3$). Further, we derive as a corollary that strip
packing is FPT with respect to the height of the strip plus the maximum of the
dimensions of the packed rectangles, which was previously only known to be in
XP. Second, we present a new parameterization, denoted $a_G$, relating graph
distance to geometric distance, which may be of independent interest. We show
that the problem is para-NP-hard parameterized by $a_G$, but FPT parameterized
by $a_G$ on trees, as well as FPT parameterized by $k+a_G$. Third, we show that
the recognition of $k\times r$ grid graphs is NP-hard on graphs of pathwidth 2
where $k=3$. Moreover, when $k$ and $r$ are unrestricted, we show that the
problem is NP-hard on trees of pathwidth 2, but trivially solvable in
polynomial time on graphs of pathwidth 1.

assume that the missing relationships must satisfy general criteria about the
working of the brain, for e.g., maximizing cognition while minimizing the cost
of supporting cognition. This allows us to extract the missing relationships by
using RL to optimize an objective (reward) function that captures the above
criteria. We use our model consisting of DEs (as a simulator) and the trained
RL agent to predict individualized 10-year AD progression using baseline (year
0) features on synthetic and real data. The model was comparable or better at
predicting 10-year cognition trajectories than state-of-the-art learning-based
models. Our interpretable model demonstrated, and provided insights into,
""recovery/compensatory"" processes that mitigate the effect of AD, even though
those processes were not explicitly encoded in the model. Our framework
combines DEs with RL for modelling AD progression and has broad applicability
for understanding other neurological disorders.

  Feedback",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  E-commerce stores collect customer feedback to let sellers learn about
customer concerns and enhance customer order experience. Because customer
feedback often contains redundant information, a concise summary of the
feedback can be generated to help sellers better understand the issues causing
customer dissatisfaction. Previous state-of-the-art abstractive text
summarization models make two major types of factual errors when producing
summaries from customer feedback, which are wrong entity detection (WED) and
incorrect product-defect description (IPD). In this work, we introduce a set of
methods to enhance the factual consistency of abstractive summarization on
customer feedback. We augment the training data with artificially corrupted
summaries, and use them as counterparts of the target summaries. We add a
contrastive loss term into the training objective so that the model learns to
avoid certain factual errors. Evaluation results show that a large portion of
WED and IPD errors are alleviated for BART and T5. Furthermore, our approaches
do not depend on the structure of the summarization model and thus are
generalizable to any abstractive summarization systems.

Previous experiments and simulations reveal a variety of drop size

Here, we perform numerical simulations of individual ligaments, the
deterministic breakup of which is triggered by random initial surface
corrugations. Stochasticity is incorporated by simulating a large ensemble of
such ligaments, each realization corresponding to a random but unique initial
configuration. The resulting probability distributions reveal three stable drop
sizes, generated via a sequence of two distinct stages of breakup. The
probability of the large sizes is described by volume-weighted Poisson and
Log-Normal distributions for the first and second breakup stages, respectively.
The study demonstrates a precisely controllable and reproducible framework,
which can be employed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the
polydispersity in drop sizes found in complex fluid fragmentation scenarios.

the lookdown framework and provides a synthesis as well as a generalization of
cases considered separately in two seminal papers by Donnelly and Kurtz (1999),
namely fluctuating population sizes under neutrality, and selection with
constant population size. As a conceptual core in our approach we introduce the
selective lookdown space which is obtained from its neutral counterpart through
a state-dependent thinning of ``potential'' selection/competition events whose
rates interact with the evolution of the type densities. The updates of the
genealogical distance matrix at the ``active'' selection/competition events are
obtained through an appropriate sampling from the selective lookdown space. The
solution of the above mentioned system of SDE's is then mapped into the joint
evolution of population size and symmetrized type configurations and
genealogies, i.e. marked distance matrix distributions. By means of Kurtz'
Markov mapping theorem, we characterize the latter process as the unique
solution of a martingale problem. For the sake of transparency we restrict the
main part of our presentation to a prototypical example with two types, which
contains the essential features. In the final section we outline an extension

generation framework to elimination trees, and prove that all elimination trees
for a chordal graph $G$ can be generated by tree rotations using a simple
greedy algorithm. This yields a short proof for the existence of Hamilton paths
on graph associahedra of chordal graphs. Graph associahedra are a general class
of high-dimensional polytopes introduced by Carr, Devadoss, and Postnikov,
whose vertices correspond to elimination trees and whose edges correspond to
tree rotations. As special cases of our results, we recover several classical
Gray codes for bitstrings, permutations and binary trees, and we obtain a new

elimination trees for a chordal graph $G$ can be implemented in time
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma)$ on average per generated elimination tree, where
$\sigma=\sigma(G)$ denotes the maximum number of edges of an induced star in

$\mathcal{O}(1)$ per generated elimination tree. We also prove that our
algorithm produces a Hamilton cycle on the graph associahedron of $G$, rather
than just Hamilton path, if the graph $G$ is chordal and 2-connected. Moreover,
our algorithm characterizes chordality, i.e., it computes a Hamilton path on

be introduced directly into solid hydrophobic materials-such as the soft

requiring additional surface or liquid modifications. Given the similarity
between mechanisms of these two approaches, models that describe wetting by
aqueous surfactant solutions should also characterize wetting on
surfactant-solid systems.
  Experiments: Multiple surfactants of varying size and chemical composition
were added to pre-polymerized PDMS samples. After cross-linking, water droplets
were placed on the surfaces at set time points, and their contact angles were
recorded to track the temporal evolution of the interfacial tension. Multiple
nonlinear models were fitted to this data, their parameters analyzed, and each
goodness of fit compared.
  Findings: An empirical model of dynamic surface tension was found to describe
the wetting process better than the single established model found in the
literature. The proposed model adapted better to the longer timescales induced
by slow molecular diffusivity in PDMS. Siloxane ethoxylate surfactants induced
faster and more complete wetting of PDMS by water than oxyoctylphenol
ethoxylates did. The generalizability of this model for characterizing
surfactants of a wide range of physiochemical properties was demonstrated.

  Language Post-Subreddit Ban","15 pages (including references and appendix), 5 figures",,,,"cs.SI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Community-level bans are a common tool against groups that enable online
harassment and harmful speech. Unfortunately, the efficacy of community bans
has only been partially studied and with mixed results. Here, we provide a
flexible unsupervised methodology to identify in-group language and track user
activity on Reddit both before and after the ban of a community (subreddit). We
use a simple word frequency divergence to identify uncommon words
overrepresented in a given community, not as a proxy for harmful speech but as
a linguistic signature of the community. We apply our method to 15 banned
subreddits, and find that community response is heterogeneous between
subreddits and between users of a subreddit. Top users were more likely to
become less active overall, while random users often reduced use of in-group
language without decreasing activity. Finally, we find some evidence that the
effectiveness of bans aligns with the content of a community. Users of dark
humor communities were largely unaffected by bans while users of communities
organized around white supremacy and fascism were the most affected.
Altogether, our results show that bans do not affect all groups or users
equally, and pave the way to understanding the effect of bans across
communities.

is still a major issue in many cases. In real-world datasets we often encounter
ambiguous labels due to subjective annotations by annotators. In our
data-centric approach, we propose a method to relabel such ambiguous labels
instead of implementing the handling of this issue in a neural network. A hard
classification is by definition not enough to capture the real-world ambiguity
of the data. Therefore, we propose our method ""Data-Centric Classification &
Clustering (DC3)"" which combines semi-supervised classification and clustering.
It automatically estimates the ambiguity of an image and performs a
classification or clustering depending on that ambiguity. DC3 is general in
nature so that it can be used in addition to many Semi-Supervised Learning
(SSL) algorithms. On average, this results in a 7.6% better F1-Score for
classifications and 7.9% lower inner distance of clusters across multiple
evaluated SSL algorithms and datasets. Most importantly, we give a
proof-of-concept that the classifications and clusterings from DC3 are
beneficial as proposals for the manual refinement of such ambiguous labels.
Overall, a combination of SSL with our method DC3 can lead to better handling
of ambiguous labels during the annotation process.

outflow lobes do not differ in these three tracers, HCN and HCO+ tend to detect
lower terminal velocity of the identified outflows compared to CO. The majority
of the outflows in our targets are young with typical dynamical time-scales of
10^2-10^4 years, and are mostly composed of low-mass outflows along with at
least one high-mass outflow in each target. An anti-correlation of outflow rate
with dynamical time-scale indicates that the outflow rate possibly decreases
with time. Also, a rising trend of dynamical time-scale with the mass of the
associated core hints that the massive cores might have longer accretion
histories than the low mass cores. Estimation of different energies in these
protoclusters shows that outflows studied here cannot account for the
generation of the observed turbulence, but can sustain the turbulence at the
current epoch as the energy injection rate from the outflows is similar to the
estimated dissipation rate.

are comparable to the ones drawn on DM-neutron and DM-proton at slightly bigger
DM masses. The detector's responses to the LO SD and SI interactions are
analyzed. In nonrelativistic limit, a constant ratio between them leads to an
indistinguishability of the SD and SI recoil energy spectra. Relativistic

adaptation depends on internal models the brain builds to represent the
relational structure of an abstract task. Emerging evidence suggests that the
well-known roles of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (HC-EC) in
integrating spatial relationships into cognitive maps can be extended to map
the transition structure between states in non-spatial abstract tasks. However,
what the EC grid-codes actually compute to afford generalization remains
elusive. We introduce two non-exclusive ideas regarding what grid-codes may
represent to afford higher-level cognition. One idea is that grid-codes are
eigenvectors of the successor representation (SR) learned online during a task.
This view assumes that the grid codes serve as an efficient basis function for
learning and representing experienced relationships between entities.
Subsequently, the grid codes facilitate generalization in novel contexts such
as when the goal changes. The second idea is that the grid-codes reflect the
inferred global task structure. This view assumes that the grid-code represents
a structural code that is factorized from specific sensory content, enabling
structural information to be transferred across tasks. Subsequently, the brain
could afford one-shot inferences without requiring experience. The ability to
generalize experiences and make appropriate decisions in novel situations is
critical for both animals and machines. Here we review proposed computations of
the grid-code in the brain, which is potentially critical to behavioral
flexibility.

as to be fully automatically differentiable. It can thus be trained on
ab-initio forces instead of just energies, to make the most out of the
available data, and can efficiently predict arbitrary derivatives of the

specific density in the spherical Bessel descriptors is key to achieving this.
Harnessing the information provided by the forces drastically reduces the
amount of atomic configurations required to train a neural network force field

with minimal computational cost. However, translational and scale invariances
inherent to this type of wave propagation problem are known to limit
traditional ROM approaches. Specifically, dimensionality reduction methods are
typically ineffective in producing low-rank models when invariances are present
in the data. In this work, an unsupervised machine learning method is used to
discover coordinate systems that make such invariances amenable to traditional
dimensionality reduction methods. The method, which has previously been
demonstrated on one-dimensional translations, is extended to higher dimensions
and additional invariances. A surrogate HANE system, i.e. a HANE-ROM, with one
detonation wave is captured well at extremely low-rank. Two detonation-waves
are also considered with various amounts of interaction between the waves, with
improvements to low-rank models for multiple wave quantities with limited
interaction.

$\delta$ Scuti star whose spectra show remarkable dumps and bumps superimposed
on the photospheric line profiles, which vary their strength and sharpness,
propagate from blue- to more red-shifted radial velocities and persisting
during a few hours, likely produced by non-radial pulsations. At the same time,
all shell lines present an emission at $\sim$3 km/s centered at the core of the
CS features, and two variable absorption minima at both sides of the emission.
The variations observed in the Ca ii H\&K, Fe ii and Ti ii lines occur at any
time scale from minutes to days and observing run, but without any clear
correlation or recognizable temporal pattern among the different lines. In the
case of H$\alpha$ the CS contribution is also variable in just one of the

summarize three experiments where the influence of rippling is essential to
address the results. Firstly, we observed that atomic vacancies lessen the
negative thermal expansion coefficient of free-standing graphene. We also
observed an increase of the Young's modulus with global applied strain and with
the introduction of small density defects that we attributed to the decrease of
rippling. Here, we will focus on a surprising feature observed in the data: the
experiments consistently indicate that only the rippling with wavelengths
between 5-10nm influences the mechanics of graphene. The rippling responsible
of the negative TEC and anomalous elasticity is thought to be dynamic, i.e.
flexural phonons. However, flexural phonons with these wavelengths should have
minor effects on the mechanics of graphene, therefore other mechanisms must be
considered to address our observations. We propose static ripples as one of the
key elements to correctly understand the thermomechanics of graphene and

modified constitutive law is used to ensure that the elastic beam is
energetically conservative. We apply the finite element method to solve the
fully nonlinear steady and unsteady systems. In line with previous studies, we
show that the system always has at least one static solution and that there is
a narrow region of the parameter space where the system simultaneously exhibits
two stable static configurations: an (inflated) upper branch and a (collapsed)
lower branch, connected by a pair of limit point bifurcations to an unstable
intermediate branch. Both upper and lower static configurations can each become
unstable to self-excited oscillations, initiating either side of the region
with multiple static states. As the Reynolds number increases along the upper
branch the oscillatory limit cycle persists into the region with multiple
steady states, where interaction with the intermediate static branch suggests a
nearby homoclinic orbit. These oscillations approach zero amplitude at the
upper branch limit point, resulting in a stable tongue between the upper and
lower branch oscillations. Furthermore, this new formulation allows us to
calculate a detailed energy budget over a period of oscillation, where we show
that both upper and lower branch instabilities require an increase in the work

reconstruct the parents' separate boosts. This is the case in the 'typical'

such topology lends itself to the use of kinematic variables such as $M_2$,
designed for pairwise decays to visibles plus escaping particles, and endowed

building a network. Different characteristics of the network can become
unreliable over time or from other outside forces. In a simple setting, we
model a network as a graph where the vertices represent our objects and a
connection between these objects are represented by an edge. Generally there
are two things to consider when discussing the reliability of a network. The
first is the conditions that need to be satisfied in order for the network to
be operational. We can also consider what properties need to be satisfied in
order to render our network inoperable. The second thing we need to consider is
what properties of our network tend to fail. In certain applications edges are
prone to failure and in others vertices are prone to failure. One of the first
examples of a network reliability measure is the connectivity of a graph, which
measures the minimum number of vertices (or edges) which can be removed in
order to disconnect the graph. In this paper we extend this idea, however,
instead of considering a network to be operational if there is a component of
order larger than a fixed size, k, we define the network to be operational if
there is a component of order at least some proportion of the original order.
So as our networks become larger, we will need a component of proportionally
larger order to remain if the network is to be in an operating state. This
connectivity measure has been studied for $r=1/2$ and for the purposes of VLSI
circuit design, but we explore the measure for all $0< r <1$.

projection chamber and 5000 kg of isotopically enriched liquid xenon to search
for the decay in $^{136}$Xe. Progress in the detector design, paired with
higher fidelity in its simulation and an advanced data analysis, based on the
one used for the final results of EXO-200, produce a sensitivity prediction
that exceeds the half-life of $10^{28}$ years. Specifically, improvements have
been made in the understanding of production of scintillation photons and
charge as well as of their transport and reconstruction in the detector. The
more detailed knowledge of the detector construction has been paired with more
assays for trace radioactivity in different materials. In particular, the use
of custom electroformed copper is now incorporated in the design, leading to a
substantial reduction in backgrounds from the intrinsic radioactivity of
detector materials. Furthermore, a number of assumptions from previous
sensitivity projections have gained further support from interim work
validating the nEXO experiment concept. Together these improvements and updates
suggest that the nEXO experiment will reach a half-life sensitivity of
$1.35\times 10^{28}$ yr at 90% confidence level in 10 years of data taking,
covering the parameter space associated with the inverted neutrino mass
ordering, along with a significant portion of the parameter space for the
normal ordering scenario, for almost all nuclear matrix elements. The effects
of backgrounds deviating from the nominal values used for the projections are
also illustrated, concluding that the nEXO design is robust against a number of
imperfections of the model.

  (ICLR 2022)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is arguably one of the most popular
meta-learning algorithms nowadays. Nevertheless, its performance on few-shot
classification is far behind many recent algorithms dedicated to the problem.
In this paper, we point out several key facets of how to train MAML to excel in
few-shot classification. First, we find that MAML needs a large number of
gradient steps in its inner loop update, which contradicts its common usage in
few-shot classification. Second, we find that MAML is sensitive to the class
label assignments during meta-testing. Concretely, MAML meta-trains the
initialization of an $N$-way classifier. These $N$ ways, during meta-testing,
then have ""$N!$"" different permutations to be paired with a few-shot task of
$N$ novel classes. We find that these permutations lead to a huge variance of
accuracy, making MAML unstable in few-shot classification. Third, we
investigate several approaches to make MAML permutation-invariant, among which
meta-training a single vector to initialize all the $N$ weight vectors in the
classification head performs the best. On benchmark datasets like MiniImageNet
and TieredImageNet, our approach, which we name UNICORN-MAML, performs on a par
with or even outperforms many recent few-shot classification algorithms,
without sacrificing MAML's simplicity.

in a quantum phase diagram. In general, we regard the SM arising near the
gapless quantum criticality (either critical points or critical regions)
between the competing neighbor vacua. In particular, we demonstrate how the

plus GUT-Higgs potential inducing various Higgs transitions. Model II modifies
Model I plus a 4d discrete torsion Wess-Zumino-Witten-like term built from
GUT-Higgs field (that matches a nonperturbative global mixed gauge-gravity
anomaly captured by a 5d invertible topological field theory $w_2w_3$), which
manifests a Beyond-Landau-Ginzburg criticality between GG and PS models, with
extra Beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) excitations emerging near a quantum
critical region. If the internal symmetries were treated as global symmetries,
we show a gapless 4d deconfined quantum criticality with new BSM fractionalized
fragmentary excitations of Color-Flavor separation, and gauge enhancement
including a Dark Gauge force sector, altogether requiring a double fermionic
Spin structure named DSpin. If the internal symmetries are dynamically gauged,
we show a 4d boundary criticality such that only appropriately gauge enhanced
dynamical GUT gauge fields propagate into an extra-dimensional 5d bulk. The
phenomena may be regarded as SM deformation or morphogenesis.

bipartite correlation measure lower-bounded by the quantum mutual information
$I(A:B)$. In holographic states satisfying the quantum extremal surface
formula, where the reflected entropy is related to the area of the entanglement
wedge cross-section, there is often an order-$N^2$ gap between $S_R$ and $I$.
We provide an information-theoretic interpretation of this gap by observing
that $S_R - I$ is related to the fidelity of a particular Markov recovery
problem that is impossible in any state whose entanglement wedge cross-section
has a nonempty boundary; for this reason, we call the quantity $S_R - I$ the
Markov gap. We then prove that for time-symmetric states in pure AdS$_3$
gravity, the Markov gap is universally lower bounded by $\log(2)
\ell_{\text{AdS}}/2 G_N$ times the number of endpoints of the cross-section. We
provide evidence that this lower bound continues to hold in the presence of
bulk matter, and comment on how it might generalize above three bulk
dimensions. Finally, we explore the Markov recovery problem controlling $S_R -
I$ using fixed area states. This analysis involves deriving a formula for the
quantum fidelity -- in fact, for all the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropies
-- between fixed area states with one versus two fixed areas, which may be of

extensively in cosmology, but often there is a tension between embedding such
theories in a healthy UV completion and achieving a phenomenologically viable
screening mechanism in the IR. Here, we identify the range of interaction
couplings which allow for a smooth resummation of classical non-linearities
(necessary for kinetic/Vainshtein-type screening), and compare this with the
range allowed by unitarity, causality and locality in the underlying UV theory.
The latter region is identified using positivity bounds on the $2\to2$
scattering amplitude, and in particular by considering scattering about a
non-trivial background for the scalar we are able to place constraints on
interactions at all orders in the field (beyond quartic order). We identify two
classes of theories can both exhibit screening and satisfy existing positivity
bounds, namely scalar-tensor theories of $P(X)$ or quartic Horndeski type in
which the leading interaction contains an odd power of $X$. Finally, for the
quartic DBI Galileon (equivalent to a disformally coupled scalar in the
Einstein frame), the analogous resummation can be performed near two-body
systems and imposing positivity constraints introduces a non-perturbative
ambiguity in the screened scalar profile. These results will guide future
searches for UV complete models which exhibit screening of fifth forces in the

problem remains $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete. Our main motivation for studying this
is the well-known fact that the ground state energy of a supersymmetric system
is exactly zero if and only if a certain cohomology group is nontrivial. This
opens the door to bringing the tools of Hamiltonian complexity to study the
computational complexity of a large number of algorithmic problems that arise
in homological algebra, including problems in algebraic topology, algebraic
geometry, and group theory. We take the first steps in this direction by
introducing the $k$-local Cohomology problem and showing that it is
$\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hard and, for a large class of instances, is contained in
$\mathsf{QMA}$. We then consider the complexity of estimating normalized Betti

$\mathsf{DQC}1$, and for a large class of instances is contained in
$\mathsf{BQP}$. In light of these results, we argue that it is natural to frame
many of these homological problems in terms of finding ground states of
supersymmetric fermionic systems. As an illustration of this perspective we
discuss in some detail the model of Fendley, Schoutens, and de Boer consisting
of hard-core fermions on a graph, whose ground state structure encodes
$l$-dimensional holes in the independence complex of the graph. This offers a
new perspective on existing quantum algorithms for topological data analysis

copiously produce all kinds of particles, regardless of their charges under the

includes dark matter (DM) particles. This paper improves upon previous
calculations of DM production from primordial black holes (PBH) by consistently
including the greybody factors, and by meticulously tracking a system of
coupled Boltzmann equations. We show that the initial PBH densities required to
produce the observed relic abundance depend strongly on the DM spin, varying in
about $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude between a spin-2 and a scalar DM in the case
of non-rotating PBHs. For Kerr PBHs, we have found that the expected
enhancement in the production of bosons reduces the initial fraction needed to
explain the measurements. We further consider indirect production of DM by
assuming the existence of additional and unstable degrees of freedom emitted by
the evaporation, which later decay into the DM. For a minimal setup where there
is only one heavy particle, we find that the final relic abundance can be
increased by at most a factor of $\sim 4$ for a scalar heavy state and a
Schwarzschild PBH, or by a factor of $\sim 4.3$ for a spin-2 particle in the

affect the predicted values of extrapolated total masses. We have considered
the recent Milky Way (MW) rotation curve, firstly because of its unprecedented
accuracy, and secondly because the Galactic disk is amongst the least affected

use of NFW profile (or its generalized form, gNFW) for calculating the
dark-matter contribution to the MW rotation curve generates apparently
inconsistent results, e.g., an increase of the baryonic mass leads to increase
of the dark matter mass. Furthermore we find that NFW and gNFW profile narrow
the total mass range, leading to a possible methodological bias particularly
against small MW masses. By using the Einasto profile that is more appropriate
to represent cold dark matter haloes, we finally find that the Milky Way
slightly decreasing rotation curve favors total mass that can be as small as
2.6 $\times 10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$, disregarding any other dynamical tracers
further out in the MW. It is inconsistent with values larger than 18 $\times

future direct imaging observations. In this paper we demonstrate the use of the
Planetary Spectrum Generator to produce simulations of reflected light
exoplanet spectra. We use PSG to examine multiple issues relevant to all models
of directly imaged exoplanet spectra and to produce sample spectra of the
bright, nearby exoplanet $\upsilon$ Andromedae d, a potential direct imaging
target for next-generation facilities. We introduce a new, fast, and accurate
subsampling technique that enables calculations of disk-integrated spectra one
order of magnitude faster than Chebyshev-Gauss sampling for moderate- to
high-resolution sampling. Using this method and a first-principles-derived
atmosphere for $\upsilon$ And d, we simulate phase-dependent spectra for a
variety of different potential atmospheric configurations. The simulated
spectra for $\upsilon$ And d include versions with different haze and cloud
properties. Based on our combined analysis of this planet's orbital parameters,
phase-and illumination-appropriate model spectra, and realistic instrument
noise parameters, we find that $\upsilon$ And d is a potentially favorable
direct imaging and spectroscopy target for the Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) on
the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. When a noise model corresponding to the
Roman CGI SPC spectroscopy mode is included, PSG predicts the time required to
reach a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 of the simulated spectra in both the
central wavelength bin of the Roman CGI SPC spectroscopy mode (R=50 spectrum)
and of the Band 1 HLC imaging mode is approximately 400 and less than 40 hr,
respectively. We also discuss potential pathways to extricating information
about the planet and its atmosphere with future observations and find that
Roman observations may be able to bound the interior temperature of the planet.

Universe. The resulting 3D lightcone (LC) will encode the properties of the

using neural networks (NNs) to infer astrophysical parameters directly from 21
cm LC images. We introduce recurrent neural networks (RNNs), capable of
efficiently characterizing the evolution along the redshift axis of 21 cm LC
images. Using a large database of simulated cosmic 21 cm LCs, we compare the
relative performance in parameter estimation of different network
architectures. These including two types of RNNs, which differ in their
complexity, as well as a more traditional convolutional neural network (CNN).
For the ideal case of no instrumental effects, our simplest and easiest to
train RNN performs the best, with a mean squared parameter estimation error
(MSE) that is lower by a factor of $\ge 2$ compared with the other
architectures studied here, and a factor of $\ge 8$ lower than the
previously-studied CNN. We also corrupt the cosmic signal by adding noise
expected from a 1000 h integration with the Square Kilometre Array, as well as
excising a foreground-contaminated 'horizon wedge'. Parameter prediction errors
increase when the NNs are trained on these contaminated LC images, though
recovery is still good even in the most pessimistic case (with $R^2 \ge
0.5-0.95$). However, we find no notable differences in performance between
network architectures on the contaminated images. We argue this is due to the
size of our data set, highlighting the need for larger data sets and/or better
data augmentation in order to maximize the potential of NNs in 21 cm parameter
estimation.

de-reddened the GNS photometry. We discussed the limitations of the process and
analysed non-linear effects of the de-reddening. We obtained high resolution

computed average extinctions for each of the regions covered by the GNS. We

T-NHHOWSMs which host only 2nd-order NHWNs, having both surface and hinge FAs
protected by the quantized biorthogonal Chern number and quadrupole moment,

In contrast to ordinary WNs, the NHWNs can instantly deform to line nodes,
forming a monopole comet. The NHWNs also show exceptional tilt-rigidity, which
is a strong resistance towards titling due to attachment to exceptional
structures. This phenomenon can be a promising experimental knob. Finally, we
reveal the exceptional stability of FAs called exceptional helicity. Surface
FAs having opposite chirality can live on the same surface without gapping out

assumes centralisation and complete knowledge. However, in real decentralised
applications, agents only have partial observation capabilities. Under limited
information, agents rely on communication to divulge some of their private (and
unobservable) information to others. When an agent deliberates to resolve
conflicts, limited knowledge may cause its perspective of a correct outcome to
differ from the actual outcome of the conflict resolution. This is subjective
unfairness.
  To enable decentralised, fairness-aware conflict resolution under privacy
constraints, we have two contributions: (1) a novel interaction approach and
(2) a formalism of the relationship between privacy and fairness. Our proposed
interaction approach is an architecture for privacy-aware explainable conflict
resolution where agents engage in a dialogue of hypotheses and facts. To
measure the privacy-fairness relationship, we define subjective and objective
fairness on both the local and global scope and formalise the impact of partial
observability due to privacy in these different notions of fairness.
  We first study our proposed architecture and the privacy-fairness
relationship in the abstract, testing different argumentation strategies on a
large number of randomised cultures. We empirically demonstrate the trade-off
between privacy, objective fairness, and subjective fairness and show that
better strategies can mitigate the effects of privacy in distributed systems.
In addition to this analysis across a broad set of randomised abstract
cultures, we analyse a case study for a specific scenario: we instantiate our
architecture in a multi-agent simulation of prioritised rule-aware collision
avoidance with limited information disclosure.

Moreover, recent observational characterization reveals that mutual
inclinations tend to increase with proximity to the host star. These trends are
both consistent with the dynamical influence of a strong quadrupolar potential
arising from the host star during its early phase of rapid rotation, coupled
with a non-zero stellar obliquity. Here, we simulate a population of planetary
systems subject to the secular perturbation arising from a tilted, oblate host
star as it contracts and spins down subsequent to planet formation. We
demonstrate that this mechanism can reproduce the general increase in

delineate a parameter space wherein the host star can drive dynamical
instabilities. We suggest that approximately 5-10\% of low-mass Kepler systems

effect is that for achievable acceleration scales the finite temperature
effects are significant only for the low frequency modes of the field. Since
the density of field modes falls for small frequencies in free space, the field
modes which are relevant for the thermal effects would be less in number to
make an observably significant effect. In this work, we investigate the
response of a Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field which is
confined in a long cylindrical cavity. The density of field modes inside such a
cavity shows a {\it resonance structure} i.e. it rises abruptly for some
specific cavity configurations. We show that an accelerating detector inside
the cavity exhibits a non-trivial excitation and de-excitation rates for {\it
small} accelerations around such resonance points. If the cavity parameters are
adjusted to lie in a neighborhood of such resonance points, the (small)
acceleration-induced emission rate can be made much larger than the already
observable inertial emission rate. We comment on the possibilities of employing
this detector-field-cavity system in the experimental realization of Unruh
effect, and argue that the necessity of extremely high acceleration can be
traded off in favor of precision in cavity manufacturing for realizing
non-inertial field theoretic effects in laboratory settings.

model by periodically aggregating the clients' models without transferring the
local data. However, due to the heterogeneity of the system and data, many
approaches suffer from the ""client-drift"" issue that could significantly slow
down the convergence of the global model training. As clients perform local
updates on heterogeneous data through heterogeneous systems, their local models
drift apart. To tackle this issue, one intuitive idea is to guide the local
model training by the global teachers, i.e., past global models, where each
client learns the global knowledge from past global models via adaptive
knowledge distillation techniques. Coming from these insights, we propose a
novel approach for heterogeneous federated learning, namely FedGKD, which fuses
the knowledge from historical global models for local training to alleviate the
""client-drift"" issue. In this paper, we evaluate FedGKD with extensive
experiments on various CV/NLP datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, AG
News, SST5) and different heterogeneous settings. The proposed method is
guaranteed to converge under common assumptions, and achieves superior
empirical accuracy in fewer communication runs than five state-of-the-art

prominent approaches for network pruning or sparsification. The method prunes
the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero.
However, recent work of Gale et al. reveals that although this method yields
high compression rates on smaller datasets, it performs inconsistently on
large-scale learning tasks, such as ResNet50 on ImageNet. We analyze this
phenomenon through the lens of variational inference and find that it is likely
due to the independent modeling of binary gates, the mean-field approximation,
which is known in Bayesian statistics for its poor performance due to the crude
approximation. To mitigate this deficiency, we propose a dependency modeling of
binary gates, which can be modeled effectively as a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP). We term our algorithm Dep-$L_0$ as it prunes networks via a
dependency-enabled $L_0$ regularization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10,
CIFAR100 and ImageNet with VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet56 show that our Dep-$L_0$
outperforms the original $L_0$-HC algorithm of Louizos et al. by a significant
margin, especially on ImageNet. Compared with the state-of-the-arts network

sparsification once again very competitive on large-scale learning tasks. Our

refinement of a set of rooted trees is an important topic in mathematical
phylogenetics. The special case of a common leaf set $L$ is known to be
solvable in linear time. Existing approaches refine one input tree using
information of the others and then test whether the results are isomorphic.
  Results. A linear-time algorithm, LinCR, for constructing the common
refinement $T$ of $k$ input trees with a common leaf set is proposed that
explicitly computes the parent function of $T$ in a bottom-up approach.
  Conclusion. LinCR is simpler to implement than other asymptotically optimal
algorithms for the problem and outperforms the alternatives in empirical
comparisons.

self-documented addition of technical debt to a software project in the form of

quality, but it can also be more visible than unintentionally added or
undocumented technical debt. Understanding the implications of adding SATD to a
software project is important because developers can benefit from a better
understanding of the quality trade-offs they are making. However, empirical
studies, analyzing the survivability and removal of SATD comments, are
challenged by potential code changes or SATD comment updates that may interfere
with properly tracking their appearance, existence, and removal. In this paper,
we propose SATDBailiff, a tool that uses an existing state-of-the-art SATD
detection tool, to identify SATD in method comments, then properly track their
lifespan. SATDBailiff is given as input links to open source projects, and its
output is a list of all identified SATDs, and for each detected SATD,
SATDBailiff reports all its associated changes, including any updates to its
text, all the way to reporting its removal. The goal of SATDBailiff is to aid
researchers and practitioners in better tracking SATDs instances and providing
them with a reliable tool that can be easily extended. SATDBailiff was
validated using a dataset of previously detected and manually validated SATD
instances.
  SATDBailiff is publicly available as an open-source, along with the manual
analysis of SATD instances associated with its validation, on the project

of a surface deposited 2D material and a 0D photonic crystal nanobeam mode, we
found that there is an optimal spatial extent of the monolayer material that
maximizes such an interaction strength due to the competition between
minimizing the excitonic envelope function area and maximizing the total

the oscillator strength is expected to monotonically grow with the number of

performing experiments by using a side-coupled cavity to get better

approach to generate high-dimensional discrete objects that maximize an
expensive black-box property (e.g., drug-likeness in molecular generation,
function approximation with arithmetic expressions). However, existing methods
lack robustness as they may decide to explore areas of the latent space for
which no data was available during training and where the decoder can be
unreliable, leading to the generation of unrealistic or invalid objects. We
propose to leverage the epistemic uncertainty of the decoder to guide the
optimization process. This is not trivial though, as a naive estimation of
uncertainty in the high-dimensional and structured settings we consider would
result in high estimator variance. To solve this problem, we introduce an
importance sampling-based estimator that provides more robust estimates of
epistemic uncertainty. Our uncertainty-guided optimization approach does not
require modifications of the model architecture nor the training process. It
produces samples with a better trade-off between black-box objective and
validity of the generated samples, sometimes improving both simultaneously. We
illustrate these advantages across several experimental settings in digit

interest in this work is the possibility of high-temperature superconductivity.
Comparing calculations of the superconducting critical temperatures of the
solid phase to melting temperatures over a range of pressures leads to an
interesting question: Will the solid, in a superconducting state, melt to a
liquid that remains a superconductor? In this work, the possibility of liquid
superconductivity in metallic hydrogen is investigated. This is done by
first-principles simulations, and using the results of these to solve the
Eliashberg equations. These are carried out over the pressure (and temperature)
conditions where molecular dissociation is expected to first occur in the solid
phase. Over the pressure range $386.8(4)$--$783.7(4)$ GPa, $T_c$ increases from
$308(6)$ to $372(2)$ K with a maximum uncertainty of $10$ K; it then decreases
to $356(2)$ K at $883.7(3)$ GPa. Comparisons to the solid phase show that the
critical temperature is not significantly changed between the two phases,
though the physics behind their superconductivity is different. Careful

phase diagram show that they are higher than the melting temperatures and that
the solid will melt to liquid atomic hydrogen. The results of this work (in

interpretable confidence scores with an objective to closely align with ASR

Hence, expanding CC applications. Recently, AM customization has gained
traction with the widespread use of unified models. Conventional adaptation
strategies that customize AM expect well-matched data for the target domain
with gold-standard transcriptions. We propose a cost-effective method of using
CC scores to select an optimal adaptation data set, where we maximize ASR gains
from minimal data. We study data in various confidence ranges and optimally
choose data for AM adaptation with KL-Divergence regularization. On the
Microsoft voice search task, data selection for supervised adaptation using the
sequence-level confidence scores achieves word error rate reduction (WERR) of
8.5% for row-convolution LSTM (RC-LSTM) and 5.2% for latency-controlled
bidirectional LSTM (LC-BLSTM). In the semi-supervised case, with ASR hypotheses

(MDP) satisfies a temporal logic specification. The underlying methods rely on
an often unrealistic assumption that the MDP is precisely known. Consequently,
parametric MDPs (pMDPs) extend MDPs with transition probabilities that are
functions over unspecified parameters. The parameter synthesis problem is to
compute an instantiation of these unspecified parameters such that the
resulting MDP satisfies the temporal logic specification. We formulate the
parameter synthesis problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program

improve the runtime and scalability by multiple orders of magnitude compared to

Computationally, we formulate the proposed regression problem as a quadratic

makes the loss function more convex-like for larger-scale problems. This makes
a fast randomly initialized gradient descent algorithm possible for global

of specifications developed in the dependently typed lambda calculus LF. The
logic is parameterized by the LF signature that constitutes the specification.
Atomic formulas correspond to typing derivations relative to this signature.
The logic includes a collection of propositional connectives and quantifiers.
Quantification ranges over expressions that denote LF terms and LF contexts.
Quantifiers of the first variety are qualified by simple types that describe
the functional structure associated with the variables they bind; deeper,
dependency related properties are expressed by the body of the formula.
Context-level quantifiers are qualified by context schemas that identify
patterns of declarations out of which actual contexts may be constructed. The
semantics of variable-free atomic formulas is articulated via the derivability
in LF of the judgements they encode. Propositional constants and connectives
are understood in the usual manner and the meaning of quantifiers is explicated
through substitutions of expressions that adhere to the type qualifications.
The logic is complemented by a proof system that enables reasoning that is
sound with respect to the described semantics. The main novelties of the proof
system are the provision for case-analysis style reasoning about LF judgements,
support for inductive reasoning over the heights of LF derivations and the
encoding of LF meta-theorems. The logic is motivated by the paradigmatic
example of type assignment in the simply-typed lambda calculus and the proof
system is illustrated through the formalization of a proof of type uniqueness
for this calculus.

state of a single qubit system, and the positive-operator-valued measure (POVM)
that describes measurements on the system. The method works with only ten
measurements. We assume that a series of unitary transformations performed on
the quantum state are fully known, while making minimal assumptions about both
the density operator of the state and the POVM. The technique returns
maximum-likely estimates of both the density operator and the POVM. To
experimentally demonstrate the method, we perform reconstructions of over 300
state-measurement pairs and compare them to their expected density operators
and POVMs. We find that 95% of the reconstructed POVMs have fidelities of 0.98
or greater, and 92% of the density operators have fidelities that are 0.98 or
greater.

distribution of the treated and control subjects in terms of measured baseline
covariates. However, not all baseline variation is equally important. In the
observational context, balancing on baseline variation summarized in a
propensity score can help reduce bias due to self-selection. In both
observational and experimental studies, controlling baseline variation
associated with the expected outcomes can help increase the precision of causal
effect estimates. We propose a set of visualizations which decompose the space
of measured covariates into the different types of baseline variation important
to the study design. These ``assignment-control plots'' and variations thereof
visually illustrate core concepts of causal inference and suggest new
directions for methodological research on study design. As a practical
demonstration, we illustrate one application of assignment-control plots to a
study of cardiothoracic surgery. While the family of visualization tools for
studies of causality is relatively sparse, simple visual tools can be an asset
to education, application, and methods development.

  2021(IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation)",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Robot programming typically makes use of a set of mechanical skills that is
acquired by machine learning. Because there is in general no guarantee that
machine learning produces robot programs that are free of surprising behavior,
the safe execution of a robot program must utilize monitoring modules that take
sensor data as inputs in real time to ensure the correctness of the skill
execution. Owing to the fact that sensors and monitoring algorithms are usually
subject to physical restrictions and that effective robot programming is
sensitive to the selection of skill parameters, these considerations may lead
to different sensor input qualities such as the view coverage of a vision
system that determines whether a skill can be successfully deployed in
performing a task. Choosing improper skill parameters may cause the monitoring
modules to delay or miss the detection of important events such as a mechanical
failure. These failures may reduce the throughput in robotic manufacturing and
could even cause a destructive system crash. To address above issues, we
propose a sensing quality-aware robot programming system that automatically
computes the sensing qualities as a function of the robot's environment and
uses the information to guide non-expert users to select proper skill
parameters in the programming phase. We demonstrate our system framework on a
6DOF robot arm for an object pick-up task.

systematic error (excursion from unity magnitude and zero phase) in O3B
generally remains at a consistent level as in O3A, yet changes of detector
configurations in O3B have introduced a non-negligible change in the frequency
dependence of the error, leading to larger excursions from unity at some
frequencies and/or during some observational periods; in some other periods the

principle to two important areas in machine learning and neuroscience. The free
energy principle is a general mathematical theory of the necessary
information-theoretic behaviours of systems that maintain a separation from
their environment. A core postulate of the theory is that complex systems can
be seen as performing variational Bayesian inference and minimizing an
information-theoretic quantity called the variational free energy. The thesis
is structured into three independent sections. Firstly, we focus on predictive
coding, a neurobiologically plausible process theory derived from the free
energy principle which argues that the primary function of the brain is to
minimize prediction errors, showing how predictive coding can be scaled up and
extended to be more biologically plausible, and elucidating its close links
with other methods such as Kalman Filtering. Secondly, we study active
inference, a neurobiologically grounded account of action through variational
message passing, and investigate how these methods can be scaled up to match
the performance of deep reinforcement learning methods. We additionally provide
a detailed mathematical understanding of the nature and origin of the
information-theoretic objectives that underlie exploratory behaviour. Finally,
we investigate biologically plausible methods of credit assignment in the
brain. We first demonstrate a close link between predictive coding and the
backpropagation of error algorithm. We go on to propose novel and simpler
algorithms which allow for backprop to be implemented in purely local,
biologically plausible computations.

configurations created by two sets of microscopic degrees of freedom (m-DOF):
positional symmetry breaking due to octahedral rotations and magnetic symmetry
breaking due to spin disorder. The effect of these sets of m-DOFs on the
electronic structure and properties of the para phases is assessed by
considering sufficiently large (super) cells with the required nominal global
average symmetry, allowing, however, the local positional and magnetic
symmetries to be lowered. We find that tendencies for local symmetry breaking
can be monitored by following total energy lowering in mean-field like density
functional theory, without recourse for strong correlation effects. While most
nominally cubic ABO3 perovskites are known for their symmetry breaking due to
the B-atom sublattice, the case of f-electron magnetism in EuTiO3 is associated
with A- sublattice symmetry breaking and its coupling to structural
distortions. We find that (i) paramagnetic cubic EuTiO3 has an intrinsic
tendency for both magnetic and positional symmetry breaking, while paramagnetic
tetragonal EuTiO3 has only magnetic symmetry lowering and no noticeable
positional symmetry lowering with respect to low-temperature antiferromagnetic
tetragonal phase. (ii) Properly modeled paramagnetic tetragonal and cubic
EuTiO3 have a nonzero local magnetic moment on each Eu ion, consistent with the
experimental observations of local magnetism in the para phases of EuTiO3
significantly above the N\'eel temperature. Interestingly, (iii) the local

is important for quality control. For example, a steel sheet is extremely
delicate, and must be accurately inspected. However, to maintain the painted
steel parts of the infrastructure around a severe outdoor environment,
corrosion detection is critical for predictive maintenance. In this paper, we
propose a general-purpose application for steel anomaly detection that consists
of the following four components. The first, a learner, is a unit image
classification network to determine whether the region of interest or
background has been recognised, after dividing the original large sized image
into 256 square unit images. The second, an extractor, is a discriminator
feature encoder based on a pre-trained steel generator with a patch generative
adversarial network discriminator(GAN). The third, an anomaly detector, is a
one-class support vector machine(SVM) to predict the anomaly score using the
discriminator feature. The fourth, an indicator, is an anomalous probability
map used to visually explain the anomalous features. Furthermore, we
demonstrated our method through the inspection of steel sheet defects with
13,774 unit images using high-speed cameras, and painted steel corrosion with
19,766 unit images based on an eye inspection of the photographs. Finally, we
visualise anomalous feature maps of steel using a strip and painted steel

dynamic task allocation problems for spatially distributed multi-agent systems.
In our approach, each member of the multi-agent team is assigned to at most one
task from a set of spatially distributed tasks, while several agents can be
allocated to the same task. The task assignment is dynamic since it is updated
at discrete time stages (iterations) to account for the current states of the
agents as the latter move towards the tasks assigned to them at the previous
stage. Our proposed methods can find applications in problems of resource
allocation by intelligent machines such as the delivery of packages by a fleet
of unmanned or semi-autonomous aerial vehicles. In our approach, the task
allocation accounts for both the cost incurred by the agents for the completion
of their assigned tasks (e.g., energy or fuel consumption) and the rewards
earned for their completion (which may reflect, for instance, the agents'
satisfaction). We propose a Greedy Coalition Auction Algorithm (GCAA) in which
the agents possess bid vectors representing their best evaluations of the task
utilities. The agents propose bids, deduce an allocation based on their bid
vectors and update them after each iteration. The solution estimate of the
proposed task allocation algorithm converges after a finite number of
iterations which cannot exceed the number of agents. Finally, we use numerical
simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed task allocation
algorithm (in terms of performance and computation time) in several scenarios

the intra-cluster communication is free. An algorithm can change the

  This natural problem admits a simple $O(\ell^2 \cdot k^2)$-competitive

typical datacenter application where virtual machines are clustered on physical

electrostatic wave transfers energy and momentum to resonant electrons, a
recoil reaction occurs in the nonresonant particles to ensure momentum
conservation. To explain how net current can be driven in spite of this
conservation, the literature often appeals to mechanisms that transfer this
nonresonant recoil momentum to ions, which carry negligible current. However,
this explanation does not allow the transport of net charge across magnetic
field lines, precluding ExB rotation drive. Here, we show that in steady state,
this picture of current drive is incomplete. Using a simple Fresnel model of
the plasma, we show that for lower hybrid waves, the electromagnetic energy
flux (Poynting vector) and momentum flux (Maxwell stress tensor) associated
with the evanescent vacuum wave, become the Minkowski energy flux and momentum
flux in the plasma, and are ultimately transferred to resonant particles. Thus,
the torque delivered to the resonant particles is ultimately supplied by the
electromagnetic torque from the antenna, allowing the nonresonant recoil
response to vanish and rotation to be driven. We present a warm fluid model
that explains how this momentum conservation works out locally, via a Reynolds
stress that does not appear in the 1D initial value problem. This model is the
simplest that can capture both the nonresonant recoil reaction in the
initial-value problem, and the absence of a nonresonant recoil in the
steady-state boundary value problem, thus forbidding rotation drive in the
former while allowing it in the latter.

coincides with the onset of power redistribution amongst several modes and the
crossover from linewidth narrowing to linewidth broadening in all individual

magnon-magnon scattering within the modes. We also find that both nonlinear
damping and threshold current in the mode-interaction damping regime at high
drive current after transition are temperature independent, suggesting that the
mode coupling occurs dominantly through a non-thermal magnon scattering process
via a dipole or exchange interaction rather than thermally excited
magnon-mediated scattering. This finding presents a promising pathway to
overcome the current limitations of efficiently controlling the interaction
between two highly nonlinear magnetic oscillators to prevent mode crosstalk or
inter-mode energy transfer and deepens understanding of complex nonlinear spin
dynamics in multimode spin wave systems.

learning approaches, which require laborious manual effort to collect and label
large amounts of data. Most Turing-complete imperative languages share similar
control- and data-flow structures, which make it possible to transfer knowledge
learned from one language to another. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual
transfer learning framework, PLATO, for statistical type inference, which
allows us to leverage prior knowledge learned from the labeled dataset of one
language and transfer it to the others, e.g., Python to JavaScript, Java to
JavaScript, etc. PLATO is powered by a novel kernelized attention mechanism to
constrain the attention scope of the backbone Transformer model such that the
model is forced to base its prediction on commonly shared features among
languages. In addition, we propose the syntax enhancement that augments the
learning on the feature overlap among language domains. Furthermore, PLATO can
also be used to improve the performance of the conventional supervised
learning-based type inference by introducing cross-lingual augmentation, which
enables the model to learn more general features across multiple languages. We
evaluated PLATO under two settings: 1) under the cross-domain scenario that the

their short-term and momentarily variability. This paper presents a
hierarchical control system to provide ancillary services from a solar PV power
plant to the grid without the need for additional non-solar resources. With
coordinated management of each inverter in the system, the control system
commands the power plant to proactively curtail a fraction of its instantaneous
maximum power potential, which gives the plant enough headroom to ramp up or
down power production from the overall power plant, for a service such as
regulation reserve, even under changing cloud cover conditions. A case study
from a site in Hawaii with one-second resolution solar irradiance data is used
to verify the efficacy of the proposed control system. The algorithm is
subsequently compared with an alternative control technology from the

hierarchical control system is over 10 times more effective in reducing
generator mileage to support power fluctuations from solar PV power plants.

Towards this direction, numerous algorithmic advances have been made in the

demonstrate the use of a D-Wave quantum annealer for the calculation of excited
electronic states of molecular systems. These simulations play an important
role in a number of areas, such as photovoltaics, semiconductor technology and
nanoscience. The excited states are treated using two methods, time-dependent
Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), both
within a commonly used Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA). The resulting TDA
eigenvalue equations are solved on a D-Wave quantum annealer using the Quantum
Annealer Eigensolver (QAE), developed previously. The method is shown to
reproduce a typical basis set convergence on the example H$_2$ molecule and is
also applied to several other molecular species. Characteristic properties such
as transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths are computed as well.
Three potential energy profiles for excited states are computed for NH$_3$ as a
function of the molecular geometry. Similar to previous studies, the accuracy
of the method is dependent on the accuracy of the intermediate meta-heuristic

introduces a linear program that optimizes for station siting and macroscopic
fleet operations in a joint fashion. Given an electricity retail rate and a set
of travel demand requests, the optimization minimizes total cost for an
autonomous EV fleet comprising of travel costs, station procurement costs,

The separation of the governing equations between the fast (acoustic) and slow

physical insight into observed temporal evolution of bulk streaming flows that,

develops a quasi-stationary pattern of differential rotation that is neither
described by uniform angular velocity as assumed in current stellar evolution
models of supernova progenitors, nor by uniform specific angular momentum.
Instead, the oxygen shell develops a positive angular velocity gradient with
faster rotation at the equator than at the pole by tens of percent. We show
that the angular momentum transport inside the convection zone is not
adequately captured by a diffusive mixing-length flux proportional to the
angular velocity or angular momentum gradient. Zonal flow averages reveal
stable large-scale meridional flow and an entropy deficit near the equator that
mirrors the patterns in the angular velocity. The structure of the flow is
reminiscent of simulations of stellar surface convection zones and the
differential rotation of the Sun, suggesting that similar effects are involved;
future simulations will need to address in more detail how the interplay of
buoyancy, inertial forces, and turbulent stresses shapes differential rotation
during late-stage convection in massive stars. If convective regions develop
positive angular velocity gradients, angular momentum could be shuffled out of
the core region more efficiently, potentially making the formation of
millisecond magnetars more difficult. Our findings have implications for

trace space of $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ is $W^{1-1/p,p}(\partial\Omega)$, namely any
$W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ function has a well-defined $W^{1-1/p,p}(\partial\Omega)$
trace on its codimension-1 boundary $\partial\Omega$ and any
$W^{1-1/p,p}(\partial\Omega)$ function on $\partial\Omega$ can be extended to a
$W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ function. Recently, Dyda and Kassmann (2019) characterize the
trace space for nonlocal Dirichlet problems involving integrodifferential
operators with infinite interaction ranges, where the boundary datum is
provided on the whole complement of the given domain
$\mathbb{R}^d\backslash\Omega$. In this work, we study function spaces for
nonlocal Dirichlet problems with a finite range of nonlocal interactions, which
naturally serves a bridging role between the classical local PDE problem and
the nonlocal problem with infinite interaction ranges. For these nonlocal
Dirichlet problems, the boundary conditions are normally imposed on a region
with finite thickness volume which lies outside of the domain. We introduce a
function space on the volumetric boundary region that serves as a trace space
for these nonlocal problems and study the related extension results. Moreover,
we discuss the consistency of the new nonlocal trace space with the classical
$W^{1-1/p,p}(\partial\Omega)$ space as the size of nonlocal interaction tends
to zero. In making this connection, we conduct an investigation on the
relations between nonlocal interactions on a larger domain and the induced
interactions on its subdomain. The various forms of trace, embedding and
extension theorems may then be viewed as consequences in different scaling
limits.

microphone array settings, the spatial arrangement and number of microphones of
ad-hoc microphone arrays are not known in advance, which hinders the adaptation
of traditional speaker verification technologies to ad-hoc microphone arrays.
To overcome this weakness, in this paper, we propose attention-based
multi-channel speaker verification with ad-hoc microphone arrays. Specifically,
we add an inter-channel processing layer and a global fusion layer after the
pooling layer of a single-channel speaker verification system. The
inter-channel processing layer applies a so-called residual self-attention
along the channel dimension for allocating weights to different microphones.
The global fusion layer integrates all channels in a way that is independent to
the number of the input channels. We further replace the softmax operator in
the residual self-attention with sparsemax, which forces the channel weights of
very noisy channels to zero. Experimental results with ad-hoc microphone arrays
of over 30 channels demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. For
example, the multi-channel speaker verification with sparsemax achieves an
equal error rate (EER) of over 20% lower than oracle one-best system on
semi-real data sets, and over 30% lower on simulation data sets, in test
scenarios with both matched and mismatched channel numbers.

a teacher model or ensemble to a student model. Its success is generally
attributed to the privileged information on similarities/consistency between
the class distributions or intermediate feature representations of the teacher
model and the student model. However, directly pushing the student model to
mimic the probabilities/features of the teacher model to a large extent limits
the student model in learning undiscovered knowledge/features. In this paper,
we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework
(IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts - inheritance and
exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer
the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model,
while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different
from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is
generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual
learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn
more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general
technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance.
Furthermore, by applying our IE-KD to the training of two networks, the
performance of both can be improved w.r.t. deep mutual learning. The code and

paper describes a simple stochastic performance model of the PBFT consensus
mechanism, which is refined as not only a queueing system with complicated
service times but also a level-independent quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) process.
From the level-independent QBD process, we apply the matrix-geometric solution
to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition under which the PBFT consensus
system is stable, and to be able to numerically compute the stationary
probability vector of the QBD process. Thus we provide four useful performance
measures of the PBFT consensus mechanism, and can numerically calculate the
four performance measures. Finally, we use some numerical examples to verify
the validity of our theoretical results, and show how the four performance
measures are influenced by some key parameters of the PBFT consensus. By means
of the theory of multi-dimensional Markov processes, we are optimistic that the
methodology and results given in this paper are applicable in a wide range

frequency range with $1$ second time resolution. Out of the 12 events analyzed
in this study, nine bursts exhibit a direct decrease with time in the optically
thick spectral index $\alpha_l$, an indicator of source morphology.
Particularly, five bursts display ""flat"" spectrum ($\alpha_l\leq1.0$) compared
to that expected for a homogeneous/uniform source ($\alpha_l\approx2.9$). These
flat spectra at the low-frequencies (<$10$ GHz) can be defined as the emission
from a spatially inhomogeneous source with a large area and/or with multiple
emission components. In a subset of six events with partial cross-correlation
data, both the events with flat spectra show a source size of $\sim120$ arcsec
at $2.6-3$ GHz. Modeling based on inhomogeneity supports the conclusion that
multiple discrete sources can only reproduce a flat spectrum. We report that
these flat spectra appear predominantly in the decay phase and typically grow
flatter over the duration in most of the bursts, which indicates the increasing
inhomogeneity and complexity of the emitting volume as the flare progresses.
This large volume of flare emission filled with the trapped energetic particles
is often invisible in other wavelengths, like hard X-rays, presumably due to
the collisionless conditions in these regions of low ambient density and

exponentially-small fidelities between quantum many-qubit states. Being
non-parametric excludes the possible effects from the variational parameters,
and evidently demonstrates the advantages from the space itself. We compare
RLF-NSSL with several well-known non-parametric algorithms including naive
Bayes classifiers, k-nearest neighbors, and spectral clustering. Our method
exhibits better accuracy particularly for the unsupervised case with no labeled
samples and the few-shot cases with small numbers of labeled samples. With the
visualizations by t-stochastic neighbor embedding, our results imply that the
machine learning in the Hilbert space complies with the principles of maximal
coding rate reduction, where the low-dimensional data exhibit within-class
compressibility, between-class discrimination, and overall diversity. Our
proposals can be applied to other quantum and quantum-inspired machine
learning, including the methods using the parametric models such as tensor
networks, quantum circuits, and quantum neural networks.

controllable auxiliary phase. Here, we present a non-adaptive Bayesian phase
estimation (BPE) algorithms with an ingenious update rule of the auxiliary
phase designed via active learning. Unlike adaptive BPE algorithms, the
auxiliary phase in our algorithm is determined by a pre-established update rule
with simple statistical analysis of a small batch of data, instead of complex
calculations in every update trails. As the number of measurements for a same
amount of Bayesian updates is significantly reduced via active learning, our
algorithm can work as efficient as adaptive ones and shares the advantages
(such as wide dynamic range and perfect noise robustness) of non-adaptive ones.
Our algorithm is of promising applications in various practical quantum sensors

examples. Many existing works take the meta-learning approach, constructing a
few-shot learner that can learn from few-shot examples to generate a
classifier. Typically, the few-shot learner is constructed or meta-trained by
sampling multiple few-shot tasks in turn and optimizing the few-shot learner's
performance in generating classifiers for those tasks. The performance is
measured by how well the resulting classifiers classify the test (i.e., query)
examples of those tasks. In this paper, we point out two potential weaknesses
of this approach. First, the sampled query examples may not provide sufficient
supervision for meta-training the few-shot learner. Second, the effectiveness
of meta-learning diminishes sharply with the increasing number of shots. To
resolve these issues, we propose a novel meta-training objective for the
few-shot learner, which is to encourage the few-shot learner to generate
classifiers that perform like strong classifiers. Concretely, we associate each
sampled few-shot task with a strong classifier, which is trained with ample
labeled examples. The strong classifiers can be seen as the target classifiers
that we hope the few-shot learner to generate given few-shot examples, and we
use the strong classifiers to supervise the few-shot learner. We present an
efficient way to construct the strong classifier, making our proposed objective
an easily plug-and-play term to existing meta-learning based FSL methods. We
validate our approach, LastShot, in combinations with many representative
meta-learning methods. On several benchmark datasets, our approach leads to a
notable improvement across a variety of tasks. More importantly, with our
approach, meta-learning based FSL methods can outperform non-meta-learning
based methods at different numbers of shots.

the ``symbol'' map to construct a particle path-integral representation of the
electron propagator in a background electromagnetic field, suitable for open
fermion-line calculations. Its main advantages are the avoidance of long
products of Dirac matrices, and its ability to unify whole sets of Feynman
diagrams related by permutation of photon legs along the fermion lines. We
obtained a Bern-Kosower type master formula for the fermion propagator, dressed
with $N$ photons, in terms of the ``$N$-photon kernel,'' where this kernel
appears also in ``subleading'' terms involving only $N$-$1$ of the $N$ photons.
  In this sequel, we focus on the application of the formalism to the
calculation of on-shell amplitudes and cross sections. Universal formulas are
obtained for the fully polarised matrix elements of the fermion propagator
dressed with an arbitrary number of photons, as well as for the corresponding
spin-averaged cross sections. A major simplification of the on-shell case is
that the subleading terms drop out, but we also pinpoint other, less obvious
simplifications.
  We use integration by parts to achieve manifest transversality of these
amplitudes at the integrand level and exploit this property using the spinor
helicity technique. We give a simple proof of the vanishing of the matrix
element for ``all $+$'' photon helicities in the massless case, and find a
novel relation between the scalar and spinor spin-averaged cross sections in
the massive case. Testing the formalism on the standard linear Compton
scattering process, we find that it reproduces the known results with
remarkable efficiency. Further applications and generalisations are pointed
out.

strength of the inter-skyrmion interaction, can be controlled by the direction
of an external magnetic field. The anisotropic interaction also affects the

approaches have achieved impressive performance in various biomedical
applications. Most existing methods tend to define the adjacency matrix among
samples manually based on meta-features, and then obtain the node embeddings
for downstream tasks by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, it is not
easy for these approaches to generalize to unseen samples. Meanwhile, the
complex correlation between modalities is also ignored. As a result, these
factors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing valid information about
the patient's condition for a reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end Multimodal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction.
To effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated
with diseases, amodal-attentional multi-modal fusion is proposed to integrate
the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity
between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the adjacency matrix
manually as existing methods, the latent graph structure can be captured
through a novel way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized
with the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among
samples. Unlike the previous transductive methods, our model is also applicable
to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group
of experiments on two disease prediction problems is then carefully designed
and presented, demonstrating that MMGL obtains more favorable performances. In
addition, we also visualize and analyze the learned graph structure to provide
more reliable decision support for doctors in real medical applications and
inspiration for disease research.

database is better and in what terms. To provide an optimal solution to
availability of multiple bibliographic databases, we have implemented a single
authentic database named as ``conflate'' which can be used for fetching
publication and citation trend of an author. To further strengthen the
generated database and to provide the transparent system to the stakeholders, a
consensus mechanism ``proof of reference (PoR)'' is proposed. Due to three

a authentic and honest citation data source for the calculation of unified

estimator for a Bayesian linear inverse problem with respect to the mean
squared error. It arises as the solution operator to a Tikhonov-type
regularized inverse problem with a particular quadratic discrepancy term and a
particular quadratic regularization operator. To be able to evaluate the LMMSE
estimator, one must know the forward operator and the first two statistical
moments of both the prior and the noise. If such knowledge is not available,
one may approximate the LMMSE estimator based on given samples. In this work,
it is investigated, in a finite-dimensional setting, how many samples are
needed to reliably approximate the LMMSE estimator, in the sense that, with
high probability, the mean squared error of the approximation is smaller than a
given multiple of the mean squared error of the LMMSE estimator.

Like the linear LASSO, ControlBurn assigns all the feature importance of a

VHS J1256-1257AB, which, combined with the late-L dwarf VHS J1256-1257 b, forms
one of the few young triple systems of ultra-cool dwarfs currently known.
Methods: We analyzed two-minute TESS and two-second Spitzer archival data with
total durations of about 25 days and 36 hours, respectively. Typical precision
in the data is $\pm$1.5 % for TESS and $\pm$0.1 % (in 1 minute) for Spitzer.
Results: The optical and infrared light curves periodically exhibit epochs of
quasi-sinusoidal modulation followed by epochs of stochastic variability, which
resembles the beat pattern created by two waves of similar frequencies that
interfere with each other. Our two-wave model for the TESS data shows that the
components of VHS J1256-1257AB rotate with periods of $2.0782\pm0.0004$ h and
$2.1342\pm0.0003$ h, which is also supported by the Spitzer observations. As a
result, the fluxes of the equally bright VHS J1256-1257A and B alternate
between states of phase and anti-phase, explaining the observed photometric
variability in their combined light. The projected spectroscopic velocity of
VHS J1256-1257AB is remarkably similar to those obtained by combining the
measured rotation periods and the expected radii, which indicates that the spin
axes of VHS J1256-1257A and B are likely inclined at nearly 90 deg, as
previously reported for VHS J1256-1257 b.

runtime approximate nearest neighbor search for candidate retrieval. After the
first stage of candidate retrieval, a second stage reranking model that
utilizes other contextual information was used to generate the final matching

neuron at place $i$ detects a feature (resp., another feature). We then simply
formulate the feature and conjunction search as Boolean functions ${\rm
FTR}_n(x) = \bigvee_{i=1}^n x_i$ and ${\rm CONJ}_n(x, y) = \bigvee_{i=1}^n x_i
\wedge y_i$, respectively. We employ a threshold circuit or a discretized
circuit (such as a sigmoid circuit or a ReLU circuit with discretization) as
our models of neural networks, and consider the following four computational
resources: [i] the number of neurons (size), [ii] the number of levels (depth),
[iii] the number of active neurons outputting non-zero values (energy), and
[iv] synaptic weight resolution (weight).
  We first prove that any threshold circuit $C$ of size $s$, depth $d$, energy
$e$ and weight $w$ satisfies $\log rk(M_C) \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$,
where $rk(M_C)$ is the rank of the communication matrix $M_C$ of a
$2n$-variable Boolean function that $C$ computes. Since ${\rm CONJ}_n$ has rank
$2^n$, we have $n \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$. Thus, an exponential
lower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth threshold circuits exists if
the energy and weight are sufficiently small. Since ${\rm FTR}_n$ is computable
independently of $n$, our result suggests that computational capacity for the
feature and conjunction search are different. We also show that the inequality
is tight up to a constant factor if $ed = o(n/ \log n)$. We next show that a
similar inequality holds for any discretized circuit. Thus, if we regard the
number of gates outputting non-zero values as a measure for sparse activity,
our results suggest that larger depth helps neural networks to acquire sparse
activity.

these assumptions are not always satisfied in minimal invasive robotic
surgeries. In this work, we present an efficient reconstruction pipeline for
highly dynamic surgical scenes that runs at 28 fps. Specifically, we design a
transformer-based stereoscopic depth perception for efficient depth estimation
and a light-weight tool segmentor to handle tool occlusion. After that, a
dynamic reconstruction algorithm which can estimate the tissue deformation and
camera movement, and aggregate the information over time is proposed for
surgical scene reconstruction. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on two

recover the scene obstructed by the surgical tool and handle the movement of

users in a Rate Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) network. In the network,
messages intended for users are split into different parts that are a single
common part and respective private parts. This mechanism enables RSMA to
flexibly manage interference and thus enhance energy and spectral efficiency.
Although possessing outstanding advantages, optimizing power allocation in RSMA
is very challenging under the uncertainty of the communication channel and the
transmitter has limited knowledge of the channel information. To solve the
problem, we first develop a Markov Decision Process framework to model the
dynamic of the communication channel. The deep reinforcement algorithm is then
proposed to find the optimal power allocation policy for the transmitter
without requiring any prior information of the channel. The simulation results
show that the proposed scheme can outperform baseline schemes in terms of
average sum-rate under different power and QoS requirements.

is mostly resolved and typically along the torus equatorial direction (Paper I,
Garcia-Burillo et al. 2021). The Eddington ratios and nuclear hydrogen column
densities NH of half the sample are favorable to launching polar and/or
equatorial dusty winds, according to simulations. Six show mid-IR extended
emission in the polar direction as traced by the NLR and perpendicular to the
ALMA emission. In a few, the nuclear NH might be too high to uplift large
quantities of dusty material along the polar direction. Five galaxies have low
NH and/or Eddington ratios and thus polar dusty winds are not likely. We
generate new CAT3D-WIND disk-wind model images. At low wind-to-disk cloud
ratios the far-IR model images have disk- and ring-like morphologies. The
X-shape associated with dusty winds is seen better in the far-IR at
intermediate-high inclinations for the extended-wind configurations. In most
models, the mid-IR emission comes from the inner part of the disk/cone.
Extended bi-conical and one-sided polar mid-IR emission is seen in
extended-wind configurations and high wind-to-disk cloud ratios. When convolved
to our resolution, the model images reproduce qualitative aspects of the
observed morphologies. Low-intermediate wind-to-disk ratios are required to
account for the large fractions of unresolved mid-IR emission. This work and
Paper I provide observational support for the torus+wind scenario. The wind
component is more relevant at high Eddington ratios and/or AGN luminosities,
and polar dust emission is predicted at NH of up to $10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$. The
torus/disk component, on the other hand, prevails at low luminosities and/or

decentralized settings, when agents have limited communication and sensory
capabilities, collisions are typically avoided in a reactive fashion, relying
on local observations/communications. Prominent collision avoidance techniques,
e.g. ORCA, are computationally efficient and scale well to a large number of
agents. However, in numerous scenarios, involving navigation through the tight
passages or confined spaces, deadlocks are likely to occur due to the egoistic
behaviour of the agents and as a result, the latter can not achieve their
goals. To this end, we suggest an application of the locally confined
multi-agent path finding (MAPF) solvers that coordinate sub-groups of the
agents that appear to be in a deadlock (to detect the latter we suggest a
simple, yet efficient ad-hoc routine). We present a way to build a grid-based
MAPF instance, typically required by modern MAPF solvers. We evaluate two of
them in our experiments, i.e. Push and Rotate and a bounded-suboptimal version

standard and adversarial classifiers. In this work, we focus on the latter case
under a binary Gaussian mixture classification problem. Unlike earlier work, we
aim to derive the natural accuracy gap between the optimal Bayes and
adversarial classifiers, and study the effect of different distributional
parameters, namely separation between class centroids, class proportions, and
the covariance matrix, on the derived gap. We show that under certain
conditions, the natural error of the optimal adversarial classifier, as well as
the gap, are locally minimized when classes are balanced, contradicting the
performance of the Bayes classifier where perfect balance induces the worst
accuracy. Moreover, we show that with an $\ell_\infty$ bounded perturbation and
an adversarial budget of $\epsilon$, this gap is $\Theta(\epsilon^2)$ for the
worst-case parameters, which for suitably small $\epsilon$ indicates the
theoretical possibility of achieving robust classifiers with near-perfect
accuracy, which is rarely reflected in practical algorithms.

nature of data or seek to independently search an optimal architecture for a
given dataset, and thus are incapable of promptly adjusting the architectures
for the changed data. To address this, we present a neural architecture
adaptation method, namely Adaptation eXpert (AdaXpert), to efficiently adjust
previous architectures on the growing data. Specifically, we introduce an
architecture adjuster to generate a suitable architecture for each data
snapshot, based on the previous architecture and the different extent between
current and previous data distributions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptation
condition to determine the necessity of adjustment, thereby avoiding
unnecessary and time-consuming adjustments. Extensive experiments on two growth
scenarios (increasing data volume and number of classes) demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

demonstrate that the non-local exchange between Pb and the substrate drives the
system into a $3\times 3$ charge density wave. The electronic structure of this

Pb distortion and the large spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we show that the

Pb-substrate exchange interaction increases the bandwidth by more than a factor
1.5 with respect to DFT+U, in better agreement with STS data. The delicate

Magnetic reconnection under such conditions can operate in magnetically

from bulk motions of cooled plasmoids. The peak has a quasi-Maxwellian shape
with an effective temperature of $\sim 100$ keV, which depends only weakly on
the flow magnetization and the strength of radiative cooling. The mean bulk
energy of the reconnected plasma is roughly independent of $\sigma$, whereas
the variance is larger for higher magnetizations. The spectra also display a
high-energy tail, which receives $\sim 25$% of the dissipated reconnection
power for $\sigma=10$ and $\sim 40$% for $\sigma=40$. We complement our

in the context of the Enskog kinetic equation. The influence of the surrounding
viscous gas on the solid particles is modeled via a deterministic viscous drag
force plus a stochastic Langevin-like term. It is found first that, regardless
of the initial conditions, the system reaches (after a transient period lasting
a few collisions per particle) a universal unsteady hydrodynamic regime where
the distribution function of each species not only depends on the dimensionless
velocity (as in the homogeneous cooling state) but also on the instantaneous
temperature scaled with respect to the background temperature. To confirm this
result, theoretical predictions for the time-dependent partial temperatures are
compared against direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results; the comparison
shows an excellent agreement confirming the applicability of hydrodynamics in
granular suspensions. Also, in the transient regime, the so-called Mpemba-like
effect (namely, when an initially hotter sample cools sooner than the colder
one) is analyzed for inelastic collisions. The theoretical analysis of the
Mpemba effect is performed for initial states close to and far away from the
asymptotic steady state. In both cases, a good agreement is found again between
theory and DSMC results. As a complement of the previous studies, we determine
in this paper the dependence of the steady values of the dynamic properties of
the suspension on the parameter space of the system. More specifically, we
focus on our attention in the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$ and the fourth degree
cumulants $c_1$ and $c_2$ (measuring the departure of the velocity
distributions $f_1$ and $f_2$ from their Maxwellian forms). Finally, a linear
stability analysis of the steady state solution is also carried out showing
that the steady state is always linearly stable.

micro-gestures, i.e., unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings, which
are different from ordinary scope of gestures from other gesture datasets which
are mostly intentionally performed for illustrative purposes. Furthermore,
iMiGUE is designed to evaluate the ability of models to analyze the emotional
states by integrating information of recognized micro-gesture, rather than just
recognizing prototypes in the sequences separately (or isolatedly). This is
because the real need for emotion AI is to understand the emotional states
behind gestures in a holistic way. Moreover, to counter for the challenge of

however, they are not detected in devices with open-circuit voltages below 700
mV. In this work, simulations and experiments were used to show the effect of
localized surface defects on the overall device performance. Although the
defects did not significantly affect lifetime measurements prior to electrode
deposition or open-circuit voltage measurements at standard-test conditions, it
had a significant impact on the point of operation and, in turn, device
efficiency (up to several percent efficiency drop). Furthermore, this study
demonstrates that localized defects can have a detrimental effect on
well-passivated areas located several centimeters away through electrical
connection by the electrode. This leads to a low-injection lifetime drop after
electrode deposition. Thus, commonly measured lifetime curves before
metallization (and therefore internal voltage) are usually not representative
of their respective values after metallization. The low-injection lifetime drop
often observed after electrode deposition can derive from such local surface
defects, and not from a homogeneous passivation drop.

which can be very complex and difficult to analyze. Indeed, dynamical
properties of CRNs can be described by a set of non-linear differential
equations that rarely can be solved in closed-form, but that can instead be
used to reason on the system dynamics. In this context, one of the possible
approaches is to perform numerical simulations, which may require a high
computational effort. In particular, in order to investigate some dynamical
properties, such as robustness or global sensitivity, many simulations have to
be performed by varying the initial concentration of chemical species. Results:
In order to reduce the computational effort required when many simulations are
needed to assess a property, we exploit a new notion of monotonicity of the
output of the system (the concentration of a target chemical species at the
steady-state) with respect to the input (the initial concentration of another
chemical species). To assess such monotonicity behavior, we propose a new
graphical approach that allows us to state sufficient conditions for ensuring
that the monotonicity property holds. Our sufficient conditions allow us to
efficiently verify the monotonicity property by exploring a graph constructed
on the basis of the reactions involved in the network. Once established, our
monotonicity property allows us to drastically reduce the number of simulations
required to assess some dynamical properties of the CRN.

systematicallyimproves solar cell efficiency in the case of devices using
intrinsic and p-type layers with optimal thickness, this treatment leads to
performance degradation for devices with an insufficiently thick (p) layer on
the light-incoming side. Our results indicate that this degradation is caused
by a diminution of the (i/p)-layer stack hole-selectivity because of light
exposure. Degradation is avoided when a sufficiently thick (p) layer is used,
or when exposure of the (p) layer to UV light is avoided, as is the case of the
rear-junction configuration, commonly used in the industry. Additionally,
applying a forward bias current or an infrared light exposure results in an
efficiency increase for all investigated solar cells, independently of the
(p)-layer thickness, confirming the beneficial influence of recombination on
the performance of silicon heterojunction solar cells.

implying dust, UV radiation, and the main gaseous components (H, C+, and O).
These processes must explain the high abundance of relatively small PAHs in the
diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and imply the continuous formation of some
PAHs that are small enough (number of carbon atoms NC <~ 35-50) to be
completely dehydrogenated by interstellar UV radiation. The carbon clusters Cn
thus formed are constantly exposed to the absorption of ~10-13.6 eV UV photons,
allowing isomerization and favoring the formation of the most stable isomers.
They might tend to form irregular carbon cages. The frequent accretion of
interstellar C+ ions could favor further cage isomerization, as is known in the
laboratory for C60, possibly yielding most stable fullerenes, such as C40, C44,
and C50. These fullerenes are expected to be very stable in the diffuse ISM
because C2 ejection is not possible by single UV photon absorption, but could
need rare two-photon absorption. It is possible that at least one of these
fullerenes or its cation is as abundant as C60 or C60+ in the diffuse ISM,
although this abundance is limited by the lack of observed matching features in
observed mid-infrared spectra. B3LYP calculations of the visible spectrum for a
number of fullerene isomers with 40 <~ NC <~ 50 show that they generally have a
few spectral bands in the visible range, with f-values in the range of a few
10-2. This could make such fullerenes interesting candidates for the carriers
of some diffuse interstellar bands.

indicator for discrimination between genuine and adversarial samples. This
effort is, to the best of our knowledge, among the first to pursue such a
technical direction for detecting time-domain adversarial samples for ASV, and
hence there is a lack of established baselines for comparison. Consequently, we
implement the Griffin-Lim algorithm as the detection baseline. The proposed
approach achieves effective detection performance that outperforms the
baselines in all the settings. We also show that the neural vocoder adopted in
the detection framework is dataset-independent. Our codes will be made
open-source for future works to do fair comparison.

itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 in heterostructures with graphene. The tunnel
spin polarization of the Fe5GeTe2/graphene vdW interface is detected to be

device design enables electrical control of spin signal and realization of
basic building blocks for device application such as efficient spin injection,

with different magnetic orientations provide unique insights into the magnetic

the spectra and anisotropy of cosmic rays (CRs) by considering spatially
dependent propagation (SDP) model and nearby Geminga supernova remnant (SNR)

data. Recent observations of CR anisotropy show that the phase is consistent
with local regular magnetic field (LRMF) observed by Interstellar Boundary
Explorer (IBEX) below 100 TeV, which indicates that diffusion along LRMF is
important. In this work, we further introduce the LRMF and take into account
the effect of corresponding anisotropic diffusion to explain the anisotropy of
CRs. We find that when the diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the LRMF is
much smaller than the parallel one, the phase of anisotropy points to $\sim
R.A.= 3^h$, which accords with experimental observation below 100 TeV. We also
analyze the influence of the ratio of perpendicular and parallel diffusion
coefficient on the anisotropy and the energy dependence of the ratio. The
results illustrate that with the decrease of perpendicular diffusion, the
anisotropic phase changes from the direction of nearby source to the LRMF below
100 TeV, meanwhile it changes from the galactic center (GC) to opposite
direction of LRMF above 100 TeV. When the perpendicular diffusion coefficient
grows faster than the parallel one with energy, the diffusion approaches to the
isotropic at high energy, the phase of anisotropy shifts from the LRMF to the
GC above 100 TeV. This could be helpful to ascertain the energy dependence of

instances aren't. In fact, almost all the hard instances reside in one area:
near the Koml\'os-Szemer\'edi bound, of $\frac{1}{2}\ v\cdot ln(v) +
\frac{1}{2}\ v\cdot ln( ln(v))$ edges, where randomly generated graphs have an
approximate 50\% chance of being Hamiltonian. If the number of edges is either
much higher or much lower, the problem is not hard -- most backtracking
algorithms decide such instances in (near) polynomial time. Recently however,
targeted search efforts have identified very hard Hamiltonian cycle problem
instances very far away from the Koml\'os-Szemer\'edi bound. In that study, the
used backtracking algorithm was Vandegriend-Culberson's, which was supposedly
the most efficient of all Hamiltonian backtracking algorithms.
  In this paper, we make a unified large scale quantitative comparison for the
best known backtracking algorithms described between 1877 and 2016. We confirm
the suspicion that the Koml\'os-Szemer\'edi bound is a hard area for all
backtracking algorithms, but also that Vandegriend-Culberson is indeed the most
efficient algorithm, when expressed in consumed computing time. When measured
in recursive effectiveness however, the algorithm by Frank Rubin, almost half a
century old, performs best. In a more general algorithmic assessment, we
conjecture that edge pruning and non-Hamiltonicity checks might be largely
responsible for these recursive savings. When expressed in system time however,
denser problem instances require much more time per recursion. This is most
likely due to the costliness of the extra search pruning procedures, which are
relatively elaborate. We supply large amounts of experimental data, and a
unified single-program implementation for all six algorithms. All data and

theoretical computer science as abstract models of computation. Also the
$\lambda$-calculus has played a central role in this domain as it allows to
focus on the notion of functional computation, based on the substitution
mechanism, while abstracting away from implementation details. The present
article starts from the observation that the equivalence between these
formalisms is based on the Church-Turing Thesis rather than an actual encoding
of $\lambda$-terms into Turing (or register) machines. The reason is that these
machines are not well-suited for modelling $\lambda$-calculus programs.
  We study a class of abstract machines that we call ""addressing machine"" since
they are only able to manipulate memory addresses of other machines. The
operations performed by these machines are very elementary: load an address in
a register, apply a machine to another one via their addresses, and call the
address of another machine. We endow addressing machines with an operational
semantics based on leftmost reduction and study their behaviour. The set of
addresses of these machines can be easily turned into a combinatory algebra. In
order to obtain a model of the full untyped $\lambda$-calculus, we need to
introduce a rule that bares similarities with the $\omega$-rule and the rule
$\zeta_\beta$ from combinatory logic.

studies that this benefit gradually declines as an interaural delay is applied
to the N0S$\pi$ complex. This decline has been attributed to the reduced
interaural coherence of the noise. Here, we report detection thresholds for a
500 Hz tone in masking noise with up to 8 ms interaural delay and bandwidths
from 25 to 1000 Hz. When reducing the noise bandwidth from 100 to 50 and 25 Hz,
the masking release at 8 ms delay increases, as expected for increasing
temporal coherence with decreasing bandwidth. For bandwidths of 100 to 1000 Hz,
no significant difference was observed and detection thresholds with these
noises have a delay dependence that is fully described by the temporal
coherence imposed by the typical monaurally determined auditory filter
bandwidth. A minimalistic binaural model is suggested based on interaural phase
difference fluctuations without the assumption of delay lines.

previous theoretical work investigating the role of minor body disruption
around white dwarfs has focussed on spherical bodies, Solar System asteroids
can be more accurately modelled as triaxial ellipsoids. Here we present an
analytical framework to identify the type of disruption (tidal fragmentation,
total sublimation or direct impact) experienced by triaxial asteroids
approaching white dwarfs on extremely eccentric (e \sim 1) orbits. This
framework is then used to identify the outcomes for simplified Main belt
analogues of 100 bodies across five different white dwarf temperatures. We also
present an empirical relationship between cooling age and effective temperature
for both DA and DB white dwarfs to identify the age of the white dwarfs
considered here. We find that using a purely spherical shape model can
underestimate the physical size and radial distance at which an asteroid is
subjected to complete sublimation, and these differences increase with greater
elongation of the body. Contrastingly, fragmentation always occurs in the
largest semi-axis of a body and so can be modelled by a sphere of that radius.
Both fragmentation and sublimation are greatly affected by the body's material
composition, and hence by the composition of their progenitor asteroid belts.
The white dwarf temperature, and hence cooling age, can affect the expected
debris distribution: higher temperatures sublimate large elongated asteroids,
and cooler temperatures accommodate more direct impacts.

sufficiently powerful learning metrics, which are absent in current deep

query stage, face image retrieval drives more demands regarding model
generalization and system scalability than general image retrieval tasks. This
paper integrates product quantization with orthonormal constraints into an
end-to-end deep learning framework to effectively retrieve face images.
Specifically, a novel scheme that uses predefined orthonormal vectors as
codewords is proposed to enhance the quantization informativeness and reduce
codewords' redundancy. A tailored loss function maximizes discriminability
among identities in each quantization subspace for both the quantized and
original features. An entropy-based regularization term is imposed to reduce
the quantization error. Experiments are conducted on four commonly-used face
datasets under both seen and unseen identities retrieval settings. Our method
outperforms all the compared deep hashing/quantization state-of-the-arts under

recent advances of deep learning, exciting progress has been made. Despite
better compression performance, existing end-to-end compression algorithms are
still designed towards better signal quality in terms of rate-distortion
optimization. In this paper, we show that the design and optimization of
network architecture could be further improved for compression towards machine
vision. We propose an inverted bottleneck structure for the encoder of the
end-to-end compression towards machine vision, which specifically accounts for
efficient representation of the semantic information. Moreover, we quest the
capability of optimization by incorporating the analytics accuracy into the
optimization process, and the optimality is further explored with generalized
rate-accuracy optimization in an iterative manner. We use object detection as a
showcase for end-to-end compression towards machine vision, and extensive
experiments show that the proposed scheme achieves significant BD-rate savings
in terms of analysis performance. Moreover, the promise of the scheme is also
demonstrated with strong generalization capability towards other machine vision
tasks, due to the enabling of signal-level reconstruction.

developed to assess the ability of power systems to accommodate renewable

equations are typically used to model dispatchable regions for transmission
systems, these equations are rarely suitable for distribution networks. To
achieve a suitable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, this paper
proposes a dispatchable region formulation for distribution networks using
tight convex relaxation. Second-order cone relaxation is adopted to reformulate
the AC power flow equations, which are then approximated by a polyhedron to
improve tractability. Further, an efficient adaptive constraint generation
algorithm is employed to construct the proposed dispatchable region. Case
studies on distribution systems of various scales validate the computational
efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

this approach could result in ungrammatical sentences because it is often the

we propose a novel method of placeholder translation that can inflect specified

extend the sequence-to-sequence architecture with a character-level decoder

evaluate our approach with a Japanese-to-English translation task in the

promising avenue for efficient robot learning in realistic settings where task
supervision is not available. This can allow us to take advantage of
environments well suited for training, such as simulators or laboratories, to
learn a policy for a real robot in a home or office. To succeed, such policy
transfer must overcome both the visual domain gap (e.g. different illumination
or background) and the dynamics domain gap (e.g. different robot calibration or
modelling error) between source and target environments. However, prior policy
transfer approaches either cannot handle a large domain gap or can only address
one type of domain gap at a time. In this paper, we propose a novel policy
transfer method with iterative ""environment grounding"", IDAPT, that alternates
between (1) directly minimizing both visual and dynamics domain gaps by
grounding the source environment in the target environment domains, and (2)
training a policy on the grounded source environment. This iterative training
progressively aligns the domains between the two environments and adapts the
policy to the target environment. Once trained, the policy can be directly
executed on the target environment. The empirical results on locomotion and
robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our approach can effectively
transfer a policy across visual and dynamics domain gaps with minimal
supervision and interaction with the target environment. Videos and code are

to use the primary user spectrum opportunistically. The problem is formulated
as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and solved using two
methods: a deep Q-network (DQN) and dueling double deep Q-Network (D3QN) to
achieve the optimal policy. The purpose is to choose the best action adaptively
in every time slot based on its situation in both overlay and underlay modes to
minimize the average AoI of the secondary user. Finally, simulation experiments
are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to

  Authors listed alphabetically",,,,"math.AG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Signomials are obtained by generalizing polynomials to allow for arbitrary
real exponents. This generalization offers great expressive power, but has
historically sacrificed the organizing principle of ``degree'' that is central
to polynomial optimization theory. We reclaim that principle here through the
concept of signomial rings, which we use to derive complete convex relaxation
hierarchies of upper and lower bounds for signomial optimization via sums of
arithmetic-geometric exponentials (SAGE) nonnegativity certificates. The
Positivstellensatz underlying the lower bounds relies on the concept of
conditional SAGE and removes regularity conditions required by earlier works,
such as convexity and Archimedeanity of the feasible set. Through worked
examples we illustrate the practicality of this hierarchy in areas such as
chemical reaction network theory and chemical engineering. These examples
include comparisons to direct global solvers (e.g., BARON and ANTIGONE) and the
Lasserre hierarchy (where appropriate). The completeness of our hierarchy of
upper bounds follows from a generic construction whereby a Positivstellensatz
for signomial nonnegativity over a compact set provides for arbitrarily strong
outer approximations of the corresponding cone of nonnegative signomials. While
working toward that result, we prove basic facts on the existence and
uniqueness of solutions to signomial moment problems.

are unknown from the outset, but they are drawn from a known probability
distribution. In the standard prophet setting, a single agent makes selection
decisions in an attempt to maximize her expected reward. The novelty of our
model is the introduction of a competition setting, where multiple agents
compete over the arriving rewards, and make online selection decisions
simultaneously, as rewards arrive. If a given reward is selected by more than a
single agent, ties are broken either randomly or by a fixed ranking of the
agents. The consideration of competition turns the prophet setting from an
online decision making scenario to a multi-agent game.
  For both random and ranked tie-breaking rules, we present simple threshold
strategies for the agents that give them high guarantees, independent of the
strategies taken by others. In particular, for random tie-breaking, every agent
can guarantee herself at least $\frac{1}{k+1}$ of the highest reward, and at
least $\frac{1}{2k}$ of the optimal social welfare. For ranked tie-breaking,
the $i$th ranked agent can guarantee herself at least a half of the $i$th
highest reward. We complement these results by matching upper bounds, even with
respect to equilibrium profiles. For ranked tie-breaking rule, we also show a
correspondence between the equilibrium of the $k$-agent game and the optimal
strategy of a single decision maker who can select up to $k$ rewards.

feedback from the real environment is delayed, feedback from the model is
instantaneous, leading to high transparency. The MMT is realized in combination
with an intelligent system with two layers. The first layer utilizes Dynamic
Movement Primitives (DMP) which accounts for certain changes in the avatar
environment. And, the second layer addresses the problems caused by uncertainty
in the model using RL methods. Augmented reality was also provided to fuse the

are able to find different solutions when changes are applied to the object
position after the demonstration. The results also show DMPs to be effective at
adapting to new conditions where there is no uncertainty involved.

ensemble methods, direct interval estimation methods and conformal prediction
methods. An important issue is the calibration of these methods: the generated
prediction intervals should have a predefined coverage level, without being
overly conservative. In this work, we review the above four classes of methods
from a conceptual and experimental point of view. Results on benchmark data
sets from various domains highlight large fluctuations in performance from one
data set to another. These observations can be attributed to the violation of
certain assumptions that are inherent to some classes of methods. We illustrate
how conformal prediction can be used as a general calibration procedure for
methods that deliver poor results without a calibration step.

to calculate the pose of a device with respect to an initial location. The
resulting global pose may be used to formulate a second, consistency based,
loss term in a deep odometry setting. In such cases where multiple losses are
imposed on a network, the uncertainty over each output can be derived to weigh
the different loss terms in a maximum likelihood setting. However, when
imposing a constraint on the integrated transformation, due to how only
odometry is estimated at each iteration of the algorithm, there is no
information about the uncertainty associated with the global pose to weigh the
global loss term. In this paper, we associate uncertainties with the output
poses of a deep odometry network and propagate the uncertainties through each
iteration. Our goal is to use the estimated covariance matrix at each
incremental step to weigh the loss at the corresponding step while weighting
the global loss term using the compounded uncertainty. This formulation
provides an adaptive method to weigh the incremental and integrated loss terms
against each other, noting the increase in uncertainty as new estimates arrive.
We provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of pose estimates and show
that our method surpasses the accuracy of the state-of-the-art Visual Odometry
approaches. Then, uncertainty estimates are evaluated and comparisons against
fixed baselines are provided. Finally, the uncertainty values are used in a
realistic example to show the effectiveness of uncertainty quantification for

two new models, which originate from the Kolsky model (a nearly constant Q

explicitly a specified Q parameter and have compact and simple forms. We
provide a novel perspective on how to build a nearly constant Q dissipative
model which is beneficial for time-domain large scale wavefield forward and

nutritionists can assess individual dietary intake based on the captions
instead of the original images, reducing the risk of privacy leakage from

planetesimal and proto-embryo formation arising from pebbles becoming trapped
in short-lived pressure bumps, in thermally evolving viscous discs to examine
the sizes and distributions of proto-embryos and planetesimals throughout the
disc. We find that planetesimal sizes increase with orbital distance, from ~10
km close to the star to hundreds of kilometres further away. Proto-embryo
masses are also found to increase with orbital radius, ranging from $10^{-6}
M_{\rm \oplus}$ around the iceline, to $10^{-3} M_{\rm \oplus}$ near the orbit
of Pluto. We include prescriptions for pebble and planetesimal accretion to
examine the masses that proto-embryos can attain. Close to the star,
planetesimal accretion is efficient due to small planetesimals, whilst pebble
accretion is efficient where pebble sizes are fragmentation limited, but
inefficient when drift dominated due to low accretion rates before the pebble
supply diminishes. Exterior to the iceline, planetesimal accretion becomes
inefficient due to increasing planetesimal eccentricities, whilst pebble
accretion becomes more efficient as the initial proto-embryo masses increase,
allowing them to significantly grow before the pebble supply is depleted.
Combining both scenarios allows for more massive proto-embryos at larger
distances, since the accretion of planetesimals allows pebble accretion to
become more efficient, allowing giant planet cores to form at distances upto 10
au. By including more realistic initial proto-embryo and planetesimal sizes, as
well as combined accretion scenarios, should allow for a more complete
understanding in the beginning to end process of how planets and planetary
systems form.

establish uniqueness of the equilibrium distribution and exponential
convergence of the renormalized profile. Our technique relies on an accurate
control of the propagation of information across the large binary trees of
ancestors (the pedigree chart), and reveals an ergodicity property, meaning
that the shape of the initial datum is quickly forgotten across generations. We
combine this information with appropriate estimates for the emergence of
Gaussian tails and propagation of quadratic and exponential moments to derive
quantitative convergence rates. Our result can be interpreted as a
generalization of the Krein-Rutman theorem in a genuinely non-linear, and
non-monotone setting.

very relevant problem in many scientific fields, like geophysics and
archaeology. This can be done, for instance, with the aid of Frequency Domain
Electromagnetic (FDEM) induction devices. Inverting FDEM data is a very
challenging inverse problem, as the problem is extremely ill-posed, i.e.,
sensible to the presence of noise in the measured data, and non-linear.
Regularization methods substitute the original ill-posed problem with a
well-posed one whose solution is an accurate approximation of the desired one.
In this paper we develop a regularization method to invert FDEM data. We
propose to determine the electrical conductivity of the ground by solving a
variational problem. The minimized functional is made up by the sum of two
term: the data fitting term ensures that the recovered solution fits the
measured data, while the regularization term enforces sparsity on the Laplacian
of the solution. The trade-off between the two terms is determined by the
regularization parameter. This is achieved by minimizing an $\ell_2 - \ell_q$
functional with $0 < q \leq 2$. Since the functional we wish to minimize is
non-convex, we show that the variational problem admits a solution. Moreover,
we prove that, if the regularization parameter is tuned accordingly to the
amount of noise present in the data, this model induces a regularization
method. Some selected numerical examples on synthetic and real data show the
good performances of our proposal.

popularly-used algorithm in blind unmixing of hyperspectral images. Developed
by Jos\'{e} M. Bioucas-Dias in 2009, the algorithm is fundamentally relevant to
tackling simplex-structured matrix factorization, and by extension,
non-negative matrix factorization, which have many applications under their
umbrellas. In this article, we revisit SISAL and provide new meanings to this
quintessential algorithm. The formulation of SISAL was motivated from a
geometric perspective, with no noise. We show that SISAL can be explained as an
approximation scheme from a probabilistic simplex component analysis framework,
which is statistical and is principally more powerful in accommodating the
presence of noise. The algorithm for SISAL was designed based on a successive
convex approximation method, with a focus on practical utility. It was not
known, by analyses, whether the SISAL algorithm has any kind of guarantee of
convergence to a stationary point. By establishing associations between the
SISAL algorithm and a line-search-based proximal gradient method, we confirm
that SISAL can indeed guarantee convergence to a stationary point. Our
re-explanation of SISAL also reveals new formulations and algorithms. The
performance of these new possibilities is demonstrated by numerical
experiments.

factors is an important research topic in imaging genetics. Many efforts have
been made via building linear models, e.g. linear regression (LR), to extract
the association between imaging QTs and genetic factors such as single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, to the best of our knowledge, these
linear models could not fully uncover the complicated relationship due to the
loci's elusive and diverse impacts on imaging QTs. Though deep learning models
can extract the nonlinear relationship, they could not select relevant genetic
factors. In this paper, we proposed a novel multi-task deep feature selection
(MTDFS) method for brain imaging genetics. MTDFS first adds a multi-task
one-to-one layer and imposes a hybrid sparsity-inducing penalty to select
relevant SNPs making significant contributions to abnormal imaging QTs. It then
builds a multi-task deep neural network to model the complicated associations
between imaging QTs and SNPs. MTDFS can not only extract the nonlinear
relationship but also arms the deep neural network with the feature selection
capability. We compared MTDFS to both LR and single-task DFS (DFS) methods on
the real neuroimaging genetic data. The experimental results showed that MTDFS
performed better than both LR and DFS in terms of the QT-SNP relationship
identification and feature selection. In a word, MTDFS is powerful for
identifying risk loci and could be a great supplement to the method library for
brain imaging genetics.

solely based on sequential character images. We render each character into a
binary grayscale image and design two-channel position feature maps for it.
Formally, we first design a two-layer residual convolutional neural network,
namely HanGlyph to generate the initial glyph representation of Chinese
characters, and subsequently adopt multiple bidirectional encoder Transformer
blocks as the superstructure to capture the context-sensitive information.
Meanwhile, we feed the glyph features extracted from each layer of the HanGlyph
module into the underlying Transformer blocks by skip-connection method to
fully exploit the glyph features of Chinese characters. As the HanGlyph module
can obtain a sufficient glyph representation of any Chinese character, the
long-standing out-of-vocabulary problem could be effectively solved. Extensive
experimental results indicate that GlyphCRM substantially outperforms the
previous BERT-based state-of-the-art model on 9 fine-tuning tasks, and it has
strong transferability and generalization on specialized fields and

The sample is obtained using K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest methods and
visually inspected. The spectra are classified into 3 morphological types (10
subtypes) based on H$\alpha$ emission line profiles. Some spectra contaminated
by nebula emission lines such as from HII regions are flagged in the catalog.
We also provide a specific sub-catalog of 101 stars with the stellar wind by
calculating stellar wind or accretion flow velocities based on P Cygni or
inverse P Cygni profiles, in which 74\% of them having velocities below
400km/s. More important, with two color-color diagrams (H-K, K- W1) and (H-K,
J-H) of a collection of known Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) and classical Ae/Be
stars (CAeBes), we propose an updated criterion to separate HAeBes from CAeBes.
By the criterion, we select 201 HAeBes candidates and 5,547 CAeBes candidates
from the sample. We confirmed 66 of the 201 HAeBes by using both WISE images
and LAMOST spectra and present a specific HAeBe sub-catalog, in which 58 are
newly identified. In addition, the WISE colors (W1-W2, W1- W3, and W1-W4) show
the distribution consistency between our confirmed HAeBes and that of the known
HAeBes. Most of the 66 confirmed HAeBes locate in the lower edge of the main
sequence of hot end in the HR diagram, while the distances of about 77\% exceed
1Kpc, which enlarges the number of far distant known HAeBes.

problem (FL) to make them robust towards a few distantly located clients.
First, $k$-facility location problem ($k$FL), a common generalization of FL and
$k$ median problems, is a well studied problem in literature. In the second
variant, lower bounded facility location (LBFL), we are given a bound on the
minimum number of clients that an opened facility must serve. Lower bounds are
required in many applications like profitability in commerce and load balancing
in transportation problem. In both the cases, the cost of the solution may be
increased grossly by a few distantly located clients, called the outliers.
Thus, in this work, we extend $k$FL and LBFL to make them robust towards the
outliers. For $k$FL with outliers ($k$FLO) we present the first (constant)
factor approximation violating the cardinality requirement by +1. As a
by-product, we also obtain the first approximation for FLO based on
LP-rounding. For LBFLO, we present a tri-criteria solution with a trade-off
between the violations in lower bounds and the number of outliers. With a
violation of $1/2$ in lower bounds, we get a violation of $2$ in outliers.

We present results from a study of nuclear star-forming rings in five nearby
normal galaxies from the Star Formation in Radio Survey (SFRS) and four local
LIRGs from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) at sub-kpc
resolutions using VLA high-frequency radio continuum observations. We find that
nuclear ring star formation (NRSF) contributes 49 - 60\% of the total star
formation of the LIRGs, compared to 7 - 40\% for the normal galaxies. We
characterize a total of 58 individual star-forming regions in these rings, and
find that with measured sizes of 10 - 200 pc, NRSF regions in the LIRGs have
SFR and $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ up to 1.7 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and 402
M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$, respectively, which are about 10 times higher
than NRSF regions in the normal galaxies with similar sizes, and comparable to
lensed high-$z$ star-forming regions. At $\sim 100 - 300$ pc scales, we
estimate low contributions ($< 50\%$) of thermal free-free emission to total
radio continuum emission at 33 GHz in the NRSF regions in the LIRGs, but large
variations possibly exist at smaller physical scales. Finally, using archival
sub-kpc resolution CO (J=1-0) data of nuclear rings in the normal galaxies and
NGC 7469 (LIRG), we find a large scatter in gas depletion times at similar
molecular gas surface densities, which tentatively points to a multi-modal star
formation relation on sub-kpc scales.

  ARM processors are more energy-efficient leading to substantial electricity

By avoiding critical voltage regions, a cloud provider can run undervolted

We mimic ARM-based cloud instances by deploying our own ARM-based devices using
different generations of Raspberry Pi. Using realistic and synthetic workloads,
we demonstrate to which degree of aggressiveness the attack is relevant. The
attack is unnoticeable by our detection method up to an offset of -50mV. We

orbitally-selective Mott transitions in a three-orbital Hubbard model with
crystal field splitting at a specific filling of $2/3$, which is a minimal
Hamiltonian for ruthenates. While the SOC favors metallic state due to
enhancement of orbital hybridization at smaller on-site Coulomb repulsions, it
stabilizes the Mott insulating state ascribed to lifting of orbital
degeneracies and enhancement of band polarizations at larger electronic
interaction. Moreover, an orbitally-selective non-Fermi liquid (OSnFL), where
breakdown and retention of the Fermi liquid coexist in different orbitals,
emerges between the orbitally-selective Mott phase and the Fermi-liquid state.
This novel state can be used to account for the exotic metallic behavior
observed in 4$d$ materials, such as Ca$_{1.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$RuO$_4$, Ba$_2$RuO$_4$
under strain and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under uniaxial pressure. We propose that

whose advances bring consistent performance gains through exploring more
effective network structures. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible
backbone framework, namely CBNetV2, to construct high-performance detectors
using existing open-sourced pre-trained backbones under the pre-training
fine-tuning paradigm. In particular, CBNetV2 architecture groups multiple
identical backbones, which are connected through composite connections.
Specifically, it integrates the high- and low-level features of multiple
backbone networks and gradually expands the receptive field to more efficiently
perform object detection. We also propose a better training strategy with
assistant supervision for CBNet-based detectors. Without additional
pre-training of the composite backbone, CBNetV2 can be adapted to various
backbones (CNN-based vs. Transformer-based) and head designs of most mainstream
detectors (one-stage vs. two-stage, anchor-based vs. anchor-free-based).
Experiments provide strong evidence that, compared with simply increasing the
depth and width of the network, CBNetV2 introduces a more efficient, effective,
and resource-friendly way to build high-performance backbone networks.
Particularly, our Dual-Swin-L achieves 59.4% box AP and 51.6% mask AP on COCO
test-dev under the single-model and single-scale testing protocol, which is
significantly better than the state-of-the-art result (57.7% box AP and 50.2%
mask AP) achieved by Swin-L, while the training schedule is reduced by
6$\times$. With multi-scale testing, we push the current best single model
result to a new record of 60.1% box AP and 52.3% mask AP without using extra
training data. Code is available at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/CBNetV2.

machine learning (ML) based nominal model update mechanism, which utilizes the
linear regression technique to update the nominal model at each ILC trial only

law is proposed to deal with non-repetitive TVSs. How to tune parameters inside
ML and ILC algorithms to achieve the desired aggregate performance is also

this, these models are increasingly replacing classic approaches in object
tracking applications for motion prediction. On the one hand, these models can
capture complex object dynamics with less modeling required, but on the other

Towards this end, we present an approach for generating synthetic trajectory
data of unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs) in image space. Since UAVs, or rather
quadrotors are dynamical systems, they can not follow arbitrary trajectories.
With the prerequisite that UAV trajectories fulfill a smoothness criterion
corresponding to a minimal change of higher-order motion, methods for planning
aggressive quadrotors flights can be utilized to generate optimal trajectories
through a sequence of 3D waypoints. By projecting these maneuver trajectories,
which are suitable for controlling quadrotors, to image space, a versatile
trajectory data set is realized. To demonstrate the applicability of the
synthetic trajectory data, we show that an RNN-based prediction model solely
trained on the generated data can outperform classic reference models on a
real-world UAV tracking dataset. The evaluation is done on the publicly
available ANTI-UAV dataset.

based on a very fast, deterministic learning rule that makes LSTCNs suitable
for online learning tasks. The numerical simulations using a case study with
four windmills showed that our approach reported the lowest forecasting errors
with respect to a simple RNN, a Long Short-term Memory, a Gated Recurrent Unit,

use it to define signature, determinant, and nullity invariants for links that
bound (unoriented) spanning surfaces. The invariants are seen to depend only on
the $S^*$-equivalence class of the spanning surface. We prove a duality result
relating the invariants from one $S^*$-equivalence class of spanning surfaces
to the restricted invariants of the other.
  Using Kuperberg's theorem, these invariants give rise to well-defined
invariants of checkerboard colorable virtual links. The determinants can be
applied to determine the minimal support genus of a checkerboard colorable
virtual link. The duality result leads to a simple algorithm for computing the
invariants from the Tait graph associated to a checkerboard coloring. We show
these invariants simultaneously generalize the combinatorial invariants defined
by Im, Lee, and Lee, and those defined by Boden, Chrisman, and Gaudreau for
almost classical links.
  We examine the behavior of the invariants under orientation reversal, mirror
symmetry, and crossing change. We give a 4-dimensional interpretation of the
Gordon-Litherland pairing by relating it to the intersection form on the
relative homology of certain double branched covers. This correspondence is
made explicit through the use of virtual linking matrices associated to

high-quality datasets. However, in many cases only incomplete datasets are
available, particularly in health care applications, where each patient
typically undergoes different clinical procedures or can drop out of a study.
Since the data to train the neural networks need to be complete, most studies
discard the incomplete datapoints, which reduces the size of the training data,
or impute the missing features, which can lead to artefacts. Alas, both
approaches are inadequate when a large portion of the data is missing. Here, we
introduce GapNet, an alternative deep-learning training approach that can use
highly incomplete datasets. First, the dataset is split into subsets of samples
containing all values for a certain cluster of features. Then, these subsets
are used to train individual neural networks. Finally, this ensemble of neural
networks is combined into a single neural network whose training is fine-tuned
using all complete datapoints. Using two highly incomplete real-world medical
datasets, we show that GapNet improves the identification of patients with
underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology and of patients at risk of
hospitalization due to Covid-19. By distilling the information available in
incomplete datasets without having to reduce their size or to impute missing
values, GapNet will permit to extract valuable information from a wide range of

consensus algorithm for synchronous and asynchronous networks by developing a
local strategy where, at each time, each agent assigns a reputation (between
zero and one) to each neighbor. The reputation is then used to weigh the
neighbors' values in the update of its state. Under mild assumptions, we show
that: (i) the proposed method converges exponentially to the consensus of the
regular agents; (ii) if a regular agent identifies a neighbor as an attacked
node, then it is indeed an attacked node; (iii) if the consensus value of the
normal nodes differs from that of any of the attacked nodes' values, then the
reputation that a regular agent assigns to the attacked neighbors goes to zero.
Further, we extend our method to achieve resilience in the scenarios where
there are noisy nodes, dynamic networks and stochastic node selection. Finally,
we illustrate our algorithm with several examples, and we delineate some
attacking scenarios that can be dealt by the current proposal but not by the
state-of-the-art approaches.

DIGIT, a novel method for estimating the 3D poses of two interacting hands from

process the input imagery into a per-pixel semantic part segmentation mask and
a visual feature volume. In contrast to prior work, we do not decouple the
segmentation from the pose estimation stage, but rather leverage the per-pixel

when drops of different liquids collide, they can bounce several times before
finally coalescing when the one that evaporates faster reaches a critical size,
of the order of the capillary length. The bouncing dynamics is produced because
the drops are not only in Leidenfrost state with the substrate, they also
experience Leidenfrost effect between them at the moment of collision. This
happens due to their different boiling temperatures, and therefore, the hotter
drop works as a hot surface for the drop with lower boiling point, producing
three contact zones of Leidenfrost state simultaneously. We called this
scenario the triple Leidenfrost effect.

discrete and few word substitutions can cause significant semantic changes. To
study the impact of semantics caused by small perturbations, we conduct a
series of pilot experiments and surprisingly find that adversarial training is
useless or even harmful for the model to detect these semantic changes. To
address this problem, we propose Contrastive Learning with semantIc Negative

improve the robustness under semantically adversarial attacking. By comparing
with similar and opposite semantic examples, the model can effectively perceive
the semantic changes caused by small perturbations. Empirical results show that
our approach yields substantial improvements on a range of sentiment analysis,

compactness within the same semantics and separability across different

raged about the responsibilities that these platforms ought to bear. And yet,
despite intense scrutiny from the news media and grassroots movements of
outraged users, platforms continue to operate, from a legal standpoint, on the

simultaneously benefit from: (1) broad discretion to organize (and censor)

limitless supply of user-posted microcontent according to whatever ends they
wish; and (3) absolution from the sorts of liability born by creators of the

SLP of size $g$ in linear time into an equivalent SLP of size $O(g)$ so that
the height of the unique derivation tree is $O(\log N)$ where $N$ is the length
of the represented string (FOCS 2019). We introduce a new class of balanced
SLPs, called contracting SLPs, where for every rule $A \to \beta_1 \dots
\beta_k$ the string length of every variable $\beta_i$ on the right-hand side
is smaller by a constant factor than the string length of $A$. In particular,
the derivation tree of a contracting SLP has the property that every subtree
has logarithmic height in its leaf size. We show that a given SLP of size $g$
can be transformed in linear time into an equivalent contracting SLP of size
$O(g)$ with rules of constant length.
  We present an application to the navigation problem in compressed unranked

$i$-th child in time $O(\log d)$ where $d$ is the degree of the current node.
Contracting SLPs are also applied to the finger search problem over

pre-specified finger position, ideally in $O(\log d)$ time where $d$ is the
distance between the accessed position and the finger. We give a linear space
solution where one can access symbols or move the finger in time $O(\log d +

radiate at harmonics of the plasma frequency when the plasma has a positive
density gradient along the propagation direction of a driver. The driver
propagating at a sub-luminal group velocity excites the plasma wakefield with
the same phase velocity. However, due to the positive density gradient, the
wake phase velocity steadily increases behind the driver. As soon as the phase
velocity becomes super-luminal, the electrostatic wakefield couples efficiently
to radiative electromagnetic modes. The period of time when the phase velocity
stays above the speed of light depends on the density gradient scale length.
The wake radiates at harmonics of the plasma frequency in the teraherz (THz)
band. The angle of emission depends on the gradient scale and the time passed
behind the driver. For appropriate plasma and driver parameters, the wake can
radiate away nearly all its energy, which potentially results in an efficient,
narrow band and tunable source of THz radiation.

exciting phenomena. One paradigmatic example is the possibility of obtaining
power-law, decoherence-free, photon-mediated interactions between quantum
emitters when they interact with such photonic baths. This prediction, however,
has been obtained either by using toy-model baths, which neglect polarization
effects, or by restricting the emitter position to high-symmetry points of the
unit cell in the case of realistic structures. Here, we develop a
semi-analytical theory of dipole radiation near photonic Dirac points in
realistic structures that allows us to compute the effective photon-mediated
interactions along the whole unit cell. Using this theory, we are able to find
the positions that maximize the emitter interactions and their range, finding a
trade-off between them. Besides, using the polarization degree of freedom, we
also find positions where the nature of the collective interactions change from
being coherent to dissipative ones. Thus, our results significantly improve the
knowledge of Dirac light-matter interfaces, and can serve as a guidance for

Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) by offloading tasks to nearby edge nodes.
Meanwhile, the increasing network size makes it impractical for centralized
data processing due to limited bandwidth, and consequently a decentralized
learning scheme is preferable. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely
investigated and shown to be a promising solution for decision-making and
optimal control processes. For RL in a decentralized setup, edge nodes (agents)
connected through a communication network aim to work collaboratively to find a
policy to optimize the global reward as the sum of local rewards. However,
communication costs, scalability and adaptation in complex environments with
heterogeneous agents may significantly limit the performance of decentralized
RL. Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has a structure that
allows for decentralized implementation, and has shown faster convergence than
gradient descent based methods. Therefore, we propose an adaptive stochastic
incremental ADMM (asI-ADMM) algorithm and apply the asI-ADMM to decentralized
RL with edge-computing-empowered IIoT networks. We provide convergence
properties for proposed algorithms by designing a Lyapunov function and prove
that the asI-ADMM has $O(\frac{1}{k}) +O(\frac{1}{M})$ convergence rate where
$k$ and $ M$ are the number of iterations and batch samples, respectively.
Then, we test our algorithm with two supervised learning problems. For
performance evaluation, we simulate two applications in decentralized RL
settings with homogeneous and heterogeneous agents. The experiment results show
that our proposed algorithms outperform the state of the art in terms of
communication costs and scalability, and can well adapt to complex IoT
environments.

and which have been experimentally synthesized, i.e., which are
thermodynamically stable or metastable. These aspects provide challenges when
applying such models on theoretical candidate materials, for example for
materials discovery, where the coordinates are not known. To extend the scope
of this methodology, we investigate the performance of the Crystal Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN) on a data set of theoretical structures in
three related ternary phase diagrams (Ti,Zr,Hf)-Zn-N, which thus include many
highly unstable structures. We then investigate the impact on the performance
of using atomic positions that are only partially relaxed into local energy
minima. We also explore options for improving the performance in these
scenarios by transfer learning, either from models trained on a large database
of mostly stable systems, or a different but related phase diagram. Models
pre-trained on stable materials do not significantly improve performance, but
models trained on similar data transfer very well. We demonstrate how our
findings can be utilized to generate phase diagrams with a major reduction in
computational effort.

non-uniqueness is normally attributed to the interaction path between
molecules, especially in the interfacial-science community. In this work we
reframe this discussion of non-uniqueness in terms of the location, or
reference frame, used to measure the pressure. By using a general mathematical
description of the liquid-vapour interface, we obtain a reference frame that
moves with the interface through time, providing a new insight into the
pressure. We compare this instantaneous moving reference frame with the fixed
Eulerian one. Through this process, we show the requirement that normal
pressure balance at the moving surface is satisfied by surface fluxes, however
an additional corrective term based on surface curvature is required for the
average pressure in a volume. We make the case that a focus on the path of
integration is the cause of much of the confusion in the literature. Using an
explicit reference frame with a more general derivation of pressure clarifies
some of the issues of uniqueness in the pressure tensor and provides a pressure
tensor which is defined at any instant in time and valid away from
thermodynamic equilibrium.

While most existing works consider the appearance distances between the
detections and the tracks, they ignore the statistical information implied by
the historical appearance distance records in the tracks, which can be
particularly useful when a detection has similar distances with two or more

that models the historical appearance distances of a track with an incremental
Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) and incorporates the derived statistical

Experimental results on three MOT benchmarks confirm that HTA effectively
improves the target identification performance with a small compromise to the

a delicate balance between a multitude of competing microorganisms. Gaining a
detailed understanding of the complex network of interactions therein is
essential to maximising not only current operational efficiencies, but also for
the effective design of new treatment technologies. Metagenomics offers an
insight into these dynamic systems through the analysis of the microbial DNA
sequences present. Unique taxa are inferred through sequence clustering to form
operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with per-taxa abundance estimates obtained
from corresponding sequence counts. The data in this study comprise weekly OTU
counts from an activated sludge (AS) tank of a WWTP. To model the OTU dynamics,
we develop a Bayesian hierarchical vector autoregressive model, which is a
linear approximation to the commonly used generalised Lotka-Volterra (gLV)
model. To tackle the high dimensionality and sparsity of the data, they are
first clustered into 12 ""bins"" using a seasonal phase-based approach. The
autoregressive coefficient matrix is assumed to be sparse, so we explore
different shrinkage priors by analysing simulated data sets before selecting
the regularised horseshoe prior for the biological application. We find that
ammonia and chemical oxygen demand have a positive relationship with several
bins and pH has a positive relationship with one bin. These results are
supported by findings in the biological literature. We identify several
negative interactions, which suggests OTUs in different bins may be competing
for resources and that these relationships are complex. We also identify two
positive interactions. Although simpler than a gLV model, our vector
autoregression offers valuable insight into the microbial dynamics of the WWTP.

mass by a stellar wind, which controls the remainder of their stellar lifetime.
High angular-resolution observations show that the winds of these cool stars
typically exhibit mid- to small-scale density perturbations such as spirals and
arcs, believed to be caused by the gravitational interaction with a
(sub-)stellar companion. We aim to explore the effects of the wind-companion
interaction on the 3D density and velocity distribution of the wind, as a
function of three key parameters: wind velocity, binary separation and
companion mass. For the first time, we compare the impact on the outflow of a
planetary companion to that of a stellar companion. We intend to devise a
morphology classification scheme based on a singular parameter. With our grid
of models we cover the prominent morphology changes in a companion-perturbed
AGB outflow: slow winds with a close, massive binary companion show a more
complex morphology. Additionally, we prove that massive planets are able to
significantly impact the density structure of an AGB wind. We find that the
interaction with a companion affects the terminal velocity of the wind, which
can be explained by the gravitational slingshot mechanism. We distinguish
between two types of wind focussing to the orbital plane resulting from
distinct mechanisms: global flattening of the outflow as a result of the AGB
star's orbital motion and the formation of an EDE as a consequence of the
companion's gravitational pull. We investigate different morphology
classification schemes and uncover that the ratio of the gravitational
potential energy density of the companion to the kinetic energy density of the
AGB outflow yields a robust classification parameter for the models presented
in this paper.

elementary embedding from HOD to HOD, settling a question of Woodin. We show
that the HOD hypothesis is equivalent to a uniqueness property of elementary

confined Riesz gas of $N$ particles for large $N$ in the presence of a hard
wall. In this Riesz gas, the particles repel each other via a pairwise
interaction that behaves as $|x_i - x_j|^{-k}$ for $k>-2$, with $x_i$ denoting
the position of the $i^{\rm th}$ particle. This density can be classified into
three different regimes of $k$. For $k \geq 1$, where the interactions are
effectively short-ranged, the appropriately scaled density has a finite support
over $[-l_k(w),w]$ where $w$ is the scaled position of the wall. While the
density vanishes at the left edge of the support, it approaches a nonzero
constant at the right edge $w$. For $-1<k<1$, where the interactions are weakly
long-ranged, we find that the scaled density is again supported over
$[-l_k(w),w]$. While it still vanishes at the left edge of the support, it
diverges at the right edge $w$ algebraically with an exponent $(k-1)/2$. For
$-2<k< -1$, the interactions are strongly long-ranged that leads to a rather
exotic density profile with an extended bulk part and a delta-peak at the wall,
separated by a hole in between. Exactly at $k=-1$ the hole disappears. For
$-2<k< -1$, we find an interesting first-order phase transition when the scaled
position of the wall decreases through a critical value $w=w^*(k)$. For
$w<w^*(k)$, the density is a pure delta-peak located at the wall. The amplitude
of the delta-peak plays the role of an order parameter which jumps to the value
$1$ as $w$ is decreased through $w^*(k)$. Our analytical results are in very
good agreement with our Monte-Carlo simulations.

groups are predominantly identified based on expert advice, with homogeneity
checked using the length of stay (LOS). However, for complex patients such as
those encountered in burn care, LOS is not a perfect proxy of resource usage,
leading to incomplete homogeneity checks. To improve homogeneity in resource
usage and severity, we propose a data-driven model and the inclusion of
patient-level costing. We investigate whether a data-driven approach that
considers additional measures of resource usage can lead to a more

adopted to identify features of importance and rules that allow for a focused

increased homogeneity compared to the current HRG groups, allowing for a more

Majorana, by another effective m_{beta beta} in 0nu2beta decay. Within an
updated global analysis of (non)oscillation data, we constrain these 3nu

concordance or discordance among different constraints. Five oscillation
parameters (delta m^2, Delta m^2, theta_12, theta_23, theta_13) are

prior to the main episode have been observed. These flares may then be
associated with the last few cycles of the inspiral when the orbital frequency
is a few hundred Hz. During these final cycles, tidal forces can resonantly
excite quasi-normal modes in the inspiralling stars, leading to a rapid
increase in their amplitude. It has been shown that these modes can exert
sufficiently strong strains onto the neutron star crust to instigate yieldings.
Due to the typical frequencies of $g$-modes being $\sim 100\text{ Hz}$, their
resonances with the orbital frequency match the precursor timings and warrant
further investigation. Adopting realistic equations of state and solving the
general-relativistic pulsation equations, we study $g$-mode resonances in
coalescing quasi-circular binaries, where we consider various stellar rotation
rates, degrees of stratification, and magnetic field structures. We show that
for some combination of stellar parameters, the resonantly excited $g_1$- and
$g_2$-modes may lead to crustal failure and trigger precursor flares.

  Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2021)",,,,"q-fin.TR cs.LG q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The limit order book (LOB) depicts the fine-grained demand and supply
relationship for financial assets and is widely used in market microstructure
studies. Nevertheless, the availability and high cost of LOB data restrict its
wider application. The LOB recreation model (LOBRM) was recently proposed to
bridge this gap by synthesizing the LOB from trades and quotes (TAQ) data.
However, in the original LOBRM study, there were two limitations: (1)
experiments were conducted on a relatively small dataset containing only one
day of LOB data; and (2) the training and testing were performed in a
non-chronological fashion, which essentially re-frames the task as
interpolation and potentially introduces lookahead bias. In this study, we
extend the research on LOBRM and further validate its use in real-world
application scenarios. We first advance the workflow of LOBRM by (1) adding a
time-weighted z-score standardization for the LOB and (2) substituting the
ordinary differential equation kernel with an exponential decay kernel to lower
computation complexity. Experiments are conducted on the extended LOBSTER
dataset in a chronological fashion, as it would be used in a real-world
application. We find that (1) LOBRM with decay kernel is superior to
traditional non-linear models, and module ensembling is effective; (2)
prediction accuracy is negatively related to the volatility of order volumes
resting in the LOB; (3) the proposed sparse encoding method for TAQ exhibits
good generalization ability and can facilitate manifold tasks; and (4) the
influence of stochastic drift on prediction accuracy can be alleviated by
increasing historical samples.

from molecular absorption spectra of a series of Quasars. In comparison with

spatially resolved stellar velocity and velocity dispersion measurements. By
utilising the highly complete spectroscopic data from the GAMA survey, we
calculate marked cross-correlation functions for SAMI galaxies using a pair

an anti-correlation of stellar kinematics with environment at the 3.2$\sigma$
level, such that galaxies with low $\lambda_{R_e}$ values are preferably
located in denser galaxy environments. However, a significant correlation
between stellar mass and environment is also found (correlation at
2.4$\sigma$), as found in previous works. We compare these results to
mock-observations from the cosmological EAGLE simulations, where we find a
similar significant $\lambda_{R_e}$ anti-correlation with environment, and a
mass and environment correlation. We demonstrate that the environmental
correlation of $\lambda_{R_e}$ is not caused by the mass-environment relation.
The significant relationship between $\lambda_{R_e}$ and environment remains
when we exclude slow rotators. The signals in SAMI and EAGLE are strongest on
small scales (10-100 kpc) as expected from galaxy interactions and mergers. Our

suppression of the ballistic helical transport on edges of 2D topological
insulators. The MIs provide a spin-flip backscattering of itinerant helical
electrons. Such a backscattering reduces the ballistic conductance if the
exchange interaction between the MI and the electrons is anisotropic and the
Kondo screening is unimportant. It is well-known that the isotropic MIs do not
suppress the helical transport in systems with axial spin symmetry of the
electrons. We show that, if this symmetry is broken, the isotropic MI acquires
an effective anisotropy and suppresses the helical conductance. The peculiar
underlying mechanism is a successive backscattering of the electrons which
propagate in the same direction and have different energies. The respective
correction to the linear conductance is determined by the allowed phase space
of the electrons and scales with temperature as T^4. Hence, it disappears at
small temperatures. This qualitatively distinguishes effects governed by the
MIs with the induced and bare anisotropy; the latter is temperature
independent. If T is smaller than the applied bias, finite e V, the allowed
phase space is provided by the bias and the differential conductance scales as
(e V)^4.

benefits of systematic reuse to increase software development productivity and
software product quality. Of the three adoption approaches, i.e. extractive,
proactive and reactive, the reactive approach seems the most suitable for
software development in practice. The strength of this approach is that it
remains close to classical software development practices. In fact, it avoids a
complete analysis of the business domain and its variability (i.e. proactive
approach), and avoids requiring a set of product variants that covers this
domain (i.e. extractive approach). Nevertheless, despite these advantages, we
believe that the main obstacle of the reactive approach adoption is the lack of
automation of its re-engineering process.
  This paper proposes isiSPL: a reactive-based approach that facilitates both
construction and maintenance of an SPL. The construction of the SPL is based on
a quasi-automatic process. The maintenance of the SPL can be made on a
white-box SPL implementation, generated by isiSPL. isiSPL is based on two
steps: first, the identification and integration of the artefacts of a newly
created product into the structure of the SPL; second, the selection of a set
of artefacts and their composition to generate a new product that can either
partially or completely meet the requirements provided for a product intended
by a developer. We have implemented isiSPL and validated its integration and
generation using the two different sets of products from ArgoUML-SPL and

HSNs for the time range 1874--2020 that are consistent with the newly
calibrated ISN. Validation of the reconstructed HSNs against the direct data
available since 1945 reveals a high level of consistency, with a correlation of
r=0.94 (0.97) for the daily (monthly) data. The cumulative hemispheric
asymmetries for cycles 12-24 give a mean value of 16%, with no obvious pattern
in north-south predominance over the cycle evolution. The strongest asymmetry
occurs for cycle no. 19, in which the northern hemisphere shows a cumulated
predominance of 42%. The phase shift between the peaks of solar activity in the
two hemispheres may be up to 28 months, with a mean absolute value of 16.4
months. The phase shifts reveal an overall asymmetry of the northern hemisphere
reaching its cycle maximum earlier (in 10 out of 13 cases). Relating the ISN
and HSN peak growth rates during the cycle rise phase with the cycle amplitude
reveals higher correlations when considering the two hemispheres individually,
with r = 0.9. Our findings demonstrate that empirical solar cycle prediction
methods can be improved by investigating the solar cycle dynamics in terms of
the hemispheric sunspot numbers.

remotely sensed imaging sensors (both active and passive) is often degraded by
a variety of noise types and artifacts. Image restoration, which is a vibrant
field of research in the remote sensing community, is the task of recovering
the true unknown image from the degraded observed image. Each imaging sensor
induces unique noise types and artifacts into the observed image. This fact has
led to the expansion of restoration techniques in different paths according to
each sensor type. This review paper brings together the advances of image
restoration techniques with particular focuses on synthetic aperture radar and
hyperspectral images as the most active sub-fields of image restoration in the
remote sensing community. We, therefore, provide a comprehensive,
discipline-specific starting point for researchers at different levels (i.e.,
students, researchers, and senior researchers) willing to investigate the
vibrant topic of data restoration by supplying sufficient detail and

inconvenient to obtain constant Q wave equations in differential form, which

proposed a novel weighting function method to build the first- and second-order

during study follow-up for dynamic prediction of a time-to-event clinical
outcome. The biomarkers are typically intermittently measured, missing at some
event times, and may be subject to high biological variations, which cannot be
readily used as time-dependent covariates in a standard time-to-event model.
Moreover, they can be highly correlated if they are from in the same biological
pathway. To address these issues, we propose a flexible joint model framework
that models the multiple biomarkers with a shared latent reduced rank
longitudinal principal component model and correlates the latent process to the
event time by the Cox model for dynamic prediction of the event time. The
proposed joint model for highly correlated biomarkers is more flexible than
some existing methods since the latent trajectory shared by the multiple
biomarkers does not require specification of a priori parametric time trend and
is determined by data. We derive an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for
parameter estimation, study large sample properties of the estimators, and
adapt the developed method to make dynamic prediction of the time-to-event
outcome. Bootstrap is used for standard error estimation and inference. The
proposed method is evaluated using simulations and illustrated on a lung
transplant data to predict chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) using
chemokines measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patients.

we consider Johannsen \& Psaltis metric parameterized by mass, spin, and an
additional dimensionless hair parameter $\epsilon$. This parametric framework
in the high rotation regimes provides a well-behaved bed to the strong-gravity
test of the no-hair theorem (NHT) using the EHT data. Incorporating the
$\epsilon$ into the standard Kerr spacetime enrich it in the sense that,
depending on setting the positive and negative values for that, we deal with
alternative compact objects: deformed Kerr naked singularity and Kerr BH
solutions, respectively. Shadows associated with these two possible solutions
indicate that the deformation parameter $\epsilon$ affects the geometry shape
of standard shadow such that it becomes more oblate and prolate with
$\epsilon<0$ and $\epsilon>0$, respectively. By scanning the window associated
with three shadow observables oblateness, deviation from circularity, and
shadow diameter, we perform a numerical analysis within the range
$a_*=0.9\mp0.1$ of the dimensionless rotation parameter, to find the
constraints on the hair parameter $\epsilon$ in both possible solutions. For
both possible signs of $\epsilon$, we extract a variety of upper bounds that
are in interplay with $a_*$. Although by approaching the rotation parameters to
the extreme limit, the allowable range of both hair parameters becomes
narrower, the hairy Kerr BH solution is a more promising candidate to play the
role of the alternative compact object instead of the standard Kerr BH. The
lack of tension between hairy Kerr BH with the current observation of the EHT
shadow of the M87* SMBH carries this message that there is the possibility of
NHT violation.

strategies to achieve the net emissions reductions that would be required to
follow a pathway that limits global warming to 1.5{\deg}C with no or limited
overshoot. The transition towards a carbon-free society goes through an
inevitable increase in the share of renewable generation in the energy mix and
a drastic decrease in the total consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, this
thesis studies the integration of renewables in power systems by investigating
forecasting and decision-making tools. Indeed, in contrast to conventional
power plants, renewable energy is subject to uncertainty. Most of the
generation technologies based on renewable sources are non-dispatchable, and
their production is stochastic and complex to predict in advance. A high share
of renewables is challenging for power systems that have been designed and
sized for dispatchable units. In this context, probabilistic forecasts, which
aim at modeling the distribution of all possible future realizations, have
become a vital tool to equip decision-makers, hopefully leading to better
decisions in energy applications. This thesis focuses on two main research
questions: (1) How to produce reliable probabilistic renewable generation
forecasts, consumption, and electricity prices? (2) How to make decisions with
uncertainty using probabilistic forecasts? The thesis perimeter is the energy
management of ""small"" systems such as microgrids at a residential scale on a
day-ahead basis. It is divided into two main parts to propose directions to
address both research questions (1) a forecasting part; (2) a planning and
control part.

modify the resulting models iteratively. We present a workflow that is required
to take this knowledge into account and to apply CSD algorithms in Earth system
sciences. At the same time, we describe open research questions that still need
to be addressed. We present a way to interactively modify the outputs of the

and particles in tokamaks. This work is devoted to studying the chaotic
diffusion in multi-scale turbulence in the context of the nonlinear
wave-particle interaction. Turbulent waves with different scales of
characteristic wavelengths can interact with the same group of charged
particles when their phase velocity is close to the velocities of the charged
particles. A multi-wavenumber standard mapping is developed to model the
chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence. The diffusion coefficient is
obtained by calculating the correlation functions analytically. It is found
that the contribution of the largest scale turbulence dominates the deviation
from the quasi-linear diffusion coefficient. Increasing the overlap parameters
of the smaller scale turbulence by just the increasing the wavenumber cannot
make the diffusion coefficient to be the quasi-linear diffusion coefficient for
a finite wave amplitude. Especially, in two-scale turbulence, the diffusion
coefficient is mostly over the quasi-linear diffusion coefficient in the large
wavenumber (of the smaller scale turbulence) limit. As more scales of
components are added in the turbulence, the diffusion coefficient approaches
the quasi-linear diffusion coefficient. The results can also be applied to
other resonance-induced multi-scale turbulence in Hamiltonian systems with 1.5
or 2 degrees of freedom.

raster-based flood models on an optimised non-uniform grid: the second-order
discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) model representing the modelled data as
piecewise-planar fields, the first-order finite volume (FV1) model using
piecewise-constant fields, and the local inertial (ACC) model only evolving
piecewise-constant water depth fields. The optimised grid is generated by
applying the multiresolution analysis (MRA) of multiwavelets (MWs) to
piecewise-planar representation of raster-formatted topography data, for more
sensible grid coarsening based on one user-specified parameter. Two adaptive
solvers are also explored that apply the MRA of MWs and of Haar wavelets (HWs)
to, respectively, scale and adapt the DG2 (MWDG2) and FV1 (HWFV1) modelled data
dynamically in time. The performance of the non-uniform grid and adaptive
solvers is assessed in terms of flood depth and extent, velocities, and CPU
runtimes, with reference to the raster-based DG2 model predictions on their
finest resolution grid. The assessments considered three large-scale flooding
scenarios, involving rapid and slow-to-gradual flows. MWDG2 is found to be the
most favourable choice when modelling rapid flows, where it excels in capturing
small velocity variations. For slow-to-gradual flows, the adaptive solvers
deliver less accurate outcomes, and their efficiency can be hampered by
overhead costs of the dynamic MRA. Instead, non-uniform DG2 is recommended to
capture urban flow interactions more accurately. Non-uniform ACC is 5 times
faster to run than non-uniform DG2 but delivers close flooding depth and extent
predictions, thus is more attractive for fluvial/pluvial flood simulation over
large areas.

"2107.06388","Xiao Li","Xiao Li, William Fithian","Whiteout: when do fixed-X knockoffs fail?",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A core strength of knockoff methods is their virtually limitless
customizability, allowing an analyst to exploit machine learning algorithms and
domain knowledge without threatening the method's robust finite-sample false
discovery rate control guarantee. While several previous works have
investigated regimes where specific implementations of knockoffs are provably
powerful, general negative results are more difficult to obtain for such a
flexible method. In this work we recast the fixed-$X$ knockoff filter for the
Gaussian linear model as a conditional post-selection inference method. It adds
user-generated Gaussian noise to the ordinary least squares estimator
$\hat\beta$ to obtain a ""whitened"" estimator $\widetilde\beta$ with
uncorrelated entries, and performs inference using
$\text{sgn}(\widetilde\beta_j)$ as the test statistic for $H_j:\; \beta_j = 0$.
We prove equivalence between our whitening formulation and the more standard
formulation involving negative control predictor variables, showing how the
fixed-$X$ knockoffs framework can be used for multiple testing on any problem
with (asymptotically) multivariate Gaussian parameter estimates. Relying on
this perspective, we obtain the first negative results that universally
upper-bound the power of all fixed-$X$ knockoff methods, without regard to
choices made by the analyst. Our results show roughly that, if the leading
eigenvalues of $\text{Var}(\hat\beta)$ are large with dense leading
eigenvectors, then there is no way to whiten $\hat\beta$ without irreparably
erasing nearly all of the signal, rendering $\text{sgn}(\widetilde\beta_j)$ too
uninformative for accurate inference. We give conditions under which the true
positive rate (TPR) for any fixed-$X$ knockoff method must converge to zero
even while the TPR of Bonferroni-corrected multiple testing tends to one, and
we explore several examples illustrating this phenomenon.

dynamics of brain activity can be gained from understanding smaller and simpler
organisms, such as the nematode C. Elegans. The behavioural and structural
biology of these organisms is well-known, making them prime candidates for
benchmarking modelling and simulation techniques. In these complex neuronal
collections, classical, white-box modelling techniques based on intrinsic
structural or behavioural information are either unable to capture the profound
nonlinearities of the neuronal response to different stimuli or generate
extremely complex models, which are computationally intractable. In this paper
we show how the nervous system of C. Elegans can be modelled and simulated with
data-driven models using different neural network architectures. Specifically,
we target the use of state of the art recurrent neural networks architectures
such as LSTMs and GRUs and compare these architectures in terms of their
properties and their accuracy as well as the complexity of the resulting
models. We show that GRU models with a hidden layer size of 4 units are able to
accurately reproduce with high accuracy the system's response to very different

responsible for controlling substandard shipping in European waters and,
consequently, increasing the standards of safety, pollution prevention, and
onboard living and working conditions. Since 2011, the Memorandum adopted a
system of points, named the ""Ship Risk Profile"" (SRP), under which each ship is
assigned a risk profile according to its score on a set of criteria. Being a
multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) tool at its core, comprising criteria,
weights, and risk categories, limited research has been performed on the SRP
from an MCDA perspective. The purpose of this paper is to propose an MCDA
approach for ship risk classification through the Deck of Cards Method (DCM).
The DCM is particularly suitable within this context as it allows, intuitively
for the decision-maker, to model preference among different criteria and among
different levels on criteria scales. First, a framework is built, based on the
criteria established in the SRP. Second, the DCM is used to build the MCDA
model, including the definition of the criteria value functions and criteria
weights. Finally, the proposed MCDA model is applied to a dataset of ships and
the results are discussed. Robust results have been obtained with the proposed
approach, making it a potential alternative to the current SRP.

recent years. Final rank, which indicates the performance of a player, is one
of the most important feature for this game. This paper focuses on predicting
the final rank of the players based on their skills and abilities. In this
paper we have used different machine learning algorithms to predict the final
rank of the players on a dataset obtained from kaggle which has 29 features.
Using the correlation heatmap,we have varied the number of features used for
the model. Out of these models GBR and LGBM have given the best result with the
accuracy of 91.63% and 91.26% respectively for 14 features and the accuracy of
90.54% and 90.01% for 8 features. Although the accuracy of the models with 14
features is slightly better than 8 features, the empirical time taken by 8
features is 1.4x lesser than 14 features for LGBM and 1.5x lesser for GBR.
Furthermore, reducing the number of features any more significantly hampers the
performance of all the ML models. Therefore, we conclude that 8 is the optimal
number of features that can be used to predict the final rank of a player in
PUBG with high accuracy and low run-time.

insufficient oil supply flowrate. When late detected, this fault can
deteriorate the bearings' performance and damage the rotating machine. Thus,
early fault identification techniques should be applied to avoid this scenario
and allow effective maintenance. However, the literature about the
identification of oil starvation fault is relatively recent and very scarce.
Among the few studies available, oil starvation has been identified in early
stages using a purely deterministic technique, which can be jeopardized by
model inaccuracy. Alternatively, this paper proposes a novel method for the
identification of oil starvation faults in hydrodynamic bearings using the
rotor vibrational responses and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is a
stochastic-determinist state estimator that can deal with modelling and
measurement errors. Computational simulations performed in this paper show that
the proposed method is suitable to successfully identify the oil starvation
faults in real-time even with noisy vibrational responses, thus representing a
promising tool for the monitoring of rotating machines.

network has been used successfully to classify the images of breast cells
accurately. However, the accuracy of manual classification of those
histopathological images is comparatively low. This research aims to increase
the accuracy of the classification of breast cancer images by utilizing a
Patch-Based Classifier (PBC) along with deep learning architecture.
Methodology: The proposed system consists of a Deep Convolutional Neural
Network (DCNN) that helps in enhancing and increasing the accuracy of the
classification process. This is done by the use of the Patch-based Classifier
(PBC). CNN has completely different layers where images are first fed through
convolutional layers using hyperbolic tangent function together with the
max-pooling layer, drop out layers, and SoftMax function for classification.
Further, the output obtained is fed to a patch-based classifier that consists
of patch-wise classification output followed by majority voting. Results: The
results are obtained throughout the classification stage for breast cancer
images that are collected from breast-histology datasets. The proposed solution
improves the accuracy of classification whether or not the images had normal,
benign, in-situ, or invasive carcinoma from 87% to 94% with a decrease in
processing time from 0.45 s to 0.2s on average. Conclusion: The proposed
solution focused on increasing the accuracy of classifying cancer in the breast
by enhancing the image contrast and reducing the vanishing gradient. Finally,
this solution for the implementation of the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE) technique and modified tangent function helps in
increasing the accuracy.
