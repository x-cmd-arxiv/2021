transport properties of gases. Knowledge of ro-vibrational quenching rates is
necessary to connect spectral observations to physical properties of warm
astrophysical gasses, including exo-atmospheres. For a system of paramount
importance in this context, the vibrational bending mode quenching of H2O by
H2, we show here that exchange of vibrational to rotational and kinetic energy
remains a quantum process, despite the large numbers of quantum levels involved
and the large vibrational energy transfer. The excitation of the quantized
rotor of the projectile is by far the most effective ro-vibrational quenching
path of water. To do so, we use a fully quantum first principle computation,
potential and dynamics, converging it at all stages, in a full coupled channel

ortho-H2O by ortho H2, up to 500K, in a fully converged coupled channels

base station for users. Unlike most existing studies that assumed that a UAV
can serve all users in its communication range, we observe that both
computation and communication capabilities of a single lightweight UAV are very
limited, due to various constraints on its size, weight, and power supply.
Thus, a single UAV can only provide communication services to a limited number
of users. We study a novel problem of deploying $K$ UAVs in the top of a
disaster area such that the sum of the data rates of users served by the UAVs
is maximized, subject to that (i) the number of users served by each UAV is no
greater than its service capacity; and (ii) the communication network induced
by the $K$ UAVs is connected. We then propose a $\frac{1-1/e}{\lfloor \sqrt{K}

result of the problem by five times (the best approximation ratio so far is
$\frac{1-1/e}{5( \sqrt{K} +1)}$), where $e$ is the base of the natural
logarithm. We finally evaluate the algorithm performance via simulation

promising. Especially, the solution delivered by the proposed algorithm is up

and $R^\mu_{\nu}=g^{\alpha\beta}R^\mu_{\alpha\nu\beta}$. A deep formal
investigation of theories with lagrangians of the form
$L=L(\widetilde{R}_{(\mu\nu)})$ was initiated in [4]. In that work, the authors
leave the connection free, and find out that the torsion only appears as a
projective mode. This agrees with the widely employed condition of vanishing
torsion in these theories as a simple gauge choice. In the present work the
complementary scenario is studied namely, the one described by a lagrangian
that depends on the other possible Ricci tensor $L=L(R_{(\mu\nu)})$. The
torsion is completely characterized in terms of the metric and the connection,
and a rather detailed description of the equations of motion is presented. It
is shown that these theories are non trivial even for $1+1$ space time

is suggested that to impose zero torsion by force may result into an

Assuming a finite spin polarization of the magnetic ions, the treatment of

molecular field that polarizes the spins of free carriers. In turn, this spin
polarization of the free carriers exerts the effective field that may stabilize
DMS spin polarization below a critical temperature Tc. The treatment of such
self-consistent spontaneous DMS magnetization can be done in terms of spin-spin
interaction independent on inter-ion distance and infinitesimal in
thermodynamic limit. On the other hand, the taking additionally into account
the second order effects of carrier-ion exchange interaction treat a Weiss
field in term of the RKKY indirect spin-spin interaction, which oscillates and
not disappears at finite inter-ion distance in case of finite carriers
concentration. These both approaches result in same Curie temperature Tc

A kernel (resp. solution) of $G$ is an independent and absorbing (resp.

in the well known class of interval digraphs. A digraph $G$ is an interval
digraph if a pair of intervals $(S_u,T_u)$ can be assigned to each vertex $u$
of $G$ such that $(u,v)\in E(G)$ if and only if $S_u\cap T_v\neq\emptyset$.
Many different subclasses of interval digraphs have been defined and studied in
the literature by restricting the kinds of pairs of intervals that can be
assigned to the vertices. We observe that several of these classes, like
interval catch digraphs, interval nest digraphs, adjusted interval digraphs and
chronological interval digraphs, are subclasses of the more general class of
reflexive interval digraphs -- which arise when we require that the two
intervals assigned to a vertex have to intersect. We show that all the problems
mentioned above are efficiently solvable, in most of the cases even linear-time
solvable, in the class of reflexive interval digraphs, but are APX-hard on even
the very restricted class of interval digraphs called point-point digraphs,

in a serious impact on the environment, which has become an urgent problem to
be solved. As the reverse process of monomer polymerization, what deviates
degradation from the idealized sequential depolymerization process, thereby
bringing strange degradation products or even hindering further degradation?
This is a key issue at the atomic level that must be addressed. Herein, we
reveal that hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) during degradation, which is usually
attributed to the thermal effect, unexpectedly exhibits a strong
high-temperature tunnelling effect. This gives a possible answer to the above
question. High-precision first-principles calculations show that, in various
possible HAT pathways, lower energy barrier and stronger tunnelling effect make
the HAT reaction related to the active end of the polymer occur more easily. In
particular, although the energy barrier of the HAT reaction is only of 0.01
magnitude different from depolymerization, the tunnelling probability of the
former can be 14~32 orders of magnitude greater than that of the latter.
Furthermore, chain scission following HAT will lead to a variety of products
other than monomers. Our work highlights that quantum tunnelling may be an
important source of uncertainty in degradation and will provide a direction for
regulating the polymer degradation process.

particular, for biomedical applications such as Lab-on-Chip systems, micropumps
are used to transport and manipulate test fluids in a controlled manner. In
this work, a low-cost, structurally simple, piezoelectrically actuated
micropump was simulated and fabricated using poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The
channels in PDMS were fabricated using patterned SU-8 structures. The pump flow
rate was measured to be 9.49 uL/min, 14.06 uL/min, 20.87 uL/min for applied
voltages of 12 V, 14 V, 16 V respectively. Further, we report finite element
analysis (FEA) simulation to confirm the operation of the micropump and compare
favorably the experimentally obtained flowrate with the one predicted by
simulation. By taking these flow rates as a reference, the chamber pressure was
found to be 1.1 to 1.5 kPa from FEA simulations.
  Viscosity measurement has wide-ranging applications from the oil industry to
the pharmaceutical industry. This work provides an elaborate mathematical model
and study of measurement of viscosity in real-time using pressure sensors. For
a given flowrate, a change in liquid viscosity gives rise to a change in
pressure difference across a particular section of the pipe. Hence, by
recording the pressure change, viscosity can be calculated dynamically.
Mathematical modeling as well as finite element analysis (FEA) modeling has
been presented. A set of pressure sensors were placed at a fixed distance from
each other to get the real-time pressure change. Knowing the flow rate in the
channel, the viscosity has been calculated from the pressure difference. For
the finite element analysis, the pressure sensors were placed 60 mm away from
each other. A different ratio of the mixture of water and glycerol was used to
provide variable viscosity, which led to the variation in pressure-difference
values.

In this work, we investigate approximate greedification when reducing the KL
divergence between the parameterized policy and the Boltzmann distribution over
action values. In particular, we investigate the difference between the forward
and reverse KL divergences, with varying degrees of entropy regularization. We
show that the reverse KL has stronger policy improvement guarantees, but that
reducing the forward KL can result in a worse policy. We also demonstrate,
however, that a large enough reduction of the forward KL can induce improvement
under additional assumptions. Empirically, we show on simple continuous-action
environments that the forward KL can induce more exploration, but at the cost
of a more suboptimal policy. No significant differences were observed in the
discrete-action setting or on a suite of benchmark problems. Throughout, we
highlight that many policy gradient methods can be seen as an instance of API,
with either the forward or reverse KL for the policy update, and discuss next
steps for understanding and improving our policy optimization algorithms.

An operator in the Heisenberg picture spreads in the extended Hilbert space.
Recently, it has been proposed that the spreading dynamics has a universal
feature signaling chaoticity of underlying quantum dynamics. We demonstrate
numerically that the operator growth dynamics in the presence of the
longitudinal field follows the universal scaling law for one-dimensional
chaotic systems. We also find that the operator growth dynamics satisfies a
crossover scaling law as the longitudinal field turns on. The crossover scaling
confirms that the uniform longitudinal field makes the system chaotic at any

need of functional calibration is motivated by engineering applications where
using a constant calibration parameter results in a significant mismatch
between outputs from the computer model and the physical experiment.
Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) are used to model the optimal
calibration function, defined as the functional relationship between the
calibration parameter and control variables that gives the best prediction.
This optimal calibration function is estimated through penalized least squares
with an RKHS-norm penalty and using physical data. An uncertainty
quantification procedure is also developed for such estimates. Theoretical
guarantees of the proposed method are provided in terms of prediction
consistency and consistency of estimating the optimal calibration function. The
proposed method is tested using both real and synthetic data and exhibits more
robust performance in prediction and uncertainty quantification than the

train a deep ensemble of convolutional neural networks to select against these

we define an anti Tai mapping $M\subseteq V_1\times V_2$ as a binary relation
between two unordered labeled trees such that any two $(x,y), (x', y')\in M$
violate ancestor relationship and thus cannot be part of the same Tai mapping,
i.e. $(x\le x' \iff y\not \le y') \vee (x'\le x \iff y'\not \le y)$, given an
ancestor order $x<x'$ meaning that $x$ is an ancestor of $x'$. Finding a
maximum-weight anti Tai mapping arises in the cutting plane method for solving
the maximum-weight Tai mapping problem via integer programming. We give an

two nodes belong to the same root-to-leaf path. For this class, we give an

enjoyed, reproducing the apparent trend in the relative number of red
supergiants (RSGs) and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars has remained elusive. Previous
estimates show the RSG/WR ratio decreasing strongly with increasing
metallicity. However, the evolutionary models have always predicted a
relatively flat distribution for the RSG/WR ratio. In this paper we reexamine
this issue, drawing on recent surveys for RSGs and WRs in the Magellanic
Clouds, M31, and M33. The RSG surveys have used Gaia astrometry to eliminate
foreground contamination, and have separated RSGs from asymptotic giant branch
stars using near-infrared colors. The surveys for WRs have utilized
interference filter imaging, photometry, and image subtraction techniques to
identify candidates, which have then been confirmed spectroscopically. After
carefully matching the observational criteria to the models, we now find good
agreement in both the single-star Geneva and binary BPASS models with the new
observations. The agreement is better when we shift the RSG effective
temperatures derived from J-Ks photometry downwards by 200 K in order to agree
with the Levesque TiO effective temperature scale. In an appendix we also
present a source list of RSGs for the SMC which includes effective temperatures
and luminosities derived from near-infrared 2MASS photometry, in the same
manner as used for the other galaxies.

and machine learning. This is in part due to the increasing number of important
tasks such as meta-learning, clustering, and anomaly detection that are defined
on set inputs. These networks must take an arbitrary number of input samples
and produce the output invariant to the input set permutation. Several
algorithms have been recently developed to address this urgent need. Our paper
analyzes these algorithms using both synthetic and real-world datasets, and
shows that they are not effective in dealing with common data variations such
as image translation or viewpoint change. To address this limitation, we
propose a permutation-invariant cascaded attentional set operator (PICASO). The
gist of PICASO is a cascade of multihead attention blocks with dynamic
templates. The proposed operator is a stand-alone module that can be adapted
and extended to serve different machine learning tasks. We demonstrate the
utilities of PICASO in four diverse scenarios: (i) clustering, (ii) image
classification under novel viewpoints, (iii) image anomaly detection, and (iv)
state prediction. PICASO increases the SmallNORB image classification accuracy
with novel viewpoints by about 10% points. For set anomaly detection on CelebA
dataset, our model improves the areas under ROC and PR curves dataset by about
22% and 10%, respectively. For the state prediction on CLEVR dataset, it
improves the AP by about 40%.

a simple yet effective pre-processing approach to achieve equalized odds
fairness in machine learning software. Fairness issues have attracted
increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for
high-stakes and high-risk decisions. Amongst all the existing fairness notions,
this work specifically targets ""equalized odds"" given its advantage in always
allowing perfect classifiers. Equalized odds requires that members of every
demographic group do not receive disparate mistreatment. Prior works either
optimize for an equalized odds related metric during the learning process like
a black-box, or manipulate the training data following some intuition. This
work studies the root cause of the violation of equalized odds and how to
tackle it. We found that equalizing the class distribution in each demographic
group with sample weights is a necessary condition for achieving equalized odds
without modifying the normal training process. In addition, an important
partial condition for equalized odds (zero average odds difference) can be
guaranteed when the class distributions are weighted to be not only equal but
also balanced (1:1). Based on these analyses, we proposed FairBalance, a
pre-processing algorithm which balances the class distribution in each
demographic group by assigning calculated weights to the training data. On
eight real-world datasets, our empirical results show that, at low
computational overhead, the proposed pre-processing algorithm FairBalance can
significantly improve equalized odds without much, if any damage to the
utility. FairBalance also outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in
terms of equalized odds. To facilitate reuse, reproduction, and validation, we
made our scripts available at https://github.com/hil-se/FairBalance.

impressive performance improvements on thermal to visible face synthesis and

well on thermal faces with large pose variations. In order to deal with this
problem, heterogeneous face frontalization methods are needed in which a model
takes a thermal profile face image and generates a frontal visible face. This
is an extremely difficult problem due to the large domain as well as large pose
discrepancies between the two modalities. Despite its applications in
biometrics and surveillance, this problem is relatively unexplored in the

network (DAL-GAN) which can synthesize frontal views in the visible domain from
thermal faces with pose variations. DAL-GAN consists of a generator with an
auxiliary classifier and two discriminators which capture both local and global
texture discriminations for better synthesis. A contrastive constraint is
enforced in the latent space of the generator with the help of a dual-path
training strategy, which improves the feature vector discrimination. Finally, a
multi-purpose loss function is utilized to guide the network in synthesizing
identity preserving cross-domain frontalization. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DAL-GAN can generate better quality frontal views compared to
the other baseline methods.

particular, we implement a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the effects of the
fractality and we study how the synergy of energization at reconnecting CSs and
at non-reconnecting CSs affects the heating, the power-law high energy tail,
the escape time, and the acceleration time of electrons and ions. The
reconnecting current sheets (RCS) systematically accelerate particles and play
a key role in the formation of the power-law tail in energy distributions. On
the other hand, the stochastic energization of particles through their
interaction with non-reconnecting CSs can account for the heating of the solar
corona and the impulsive heating during solar flares. The combination of the
two acceleration mechanisms (stochastic and systematic), commonly present in
many explosive events of various sizes, influences the steady-state energy
distribution, as well as the transport properties of the particles in position-

characteristics of ions and electrons are similar, the only difference being
the time scales required to reach a steady state.

non-uniform down-sampling of SMs data. We formulate this as the problem of
learning a sparse representation of SMs data with minimum information leakage
and maximum utility. The architecture is composed of a releaser, which is a
recurrent neural network (RNN), that is trained to generate the sparse
representation by masking the SMs data, and an utility and adversary networks
(also RNNs), which help the releaser to minimize the leakage of information
about the private attribute, while keeping the reconstruction error of the SMs
data minimum (i.e., maximum utility). The performance of the proposed technique
is assessed based on actual SMs data and compared with uniform down-sampling,
random (non-uniform) down-sampling, as well as the state-of-the-art in
privacy-preserving methods using a data manipulation approach. It is shown that
our method performs better in terms of the privacy-utility trade-off while

Traditional modular methods require accurate mapping, localization and

shown promising results for autonomous driving/racing. However, they are
commonly implemented by supervised imitation learning (IL), which suffers from
the distribution mismatch problem, or by reinforcement learning (RL), which
requires a huge amount of risky interaction data. In this work, we present a
general deep imitative reinforcement learning approach (DIRL), which
successfully achieves agile autonomous racing using visual inputs. The driving
knowledge is acquired from both IL and model-based RL, where the agent can
learn from human teachers as well as perform self-improvement by safely
interacting with an offline world model. We validate our algorithm both in a
high-fidelity driving simulation and on a real-world 1/20-scale RC-car with
limited onboard computation. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous IL and RL methods in terms of sample efficiency and task

loss between hidden representations of concerned and neighboring area feature

patient-wise grades. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease
severity for a patient on a given day by learning representations from the

models with nonlinear functional forms to explore joint development where two

it is of interest to estimate regression coefficients of such unidirectional

networks. In previous work, mainline vehicles' selfish lane choice behavior at
on-ramps is studied and regarded as one cause leading to on-ramp inefficiency.
When on-ramp vehicles plan to merge into the mainline of the highway, mainline
vehicles choose to either stay steadfast on the current lane or bypass the
merging area by switching to a neighboring lane farther from the on-ramp.
Selfish vehicles make the decisions to minimize their own travel delay, which
compromises the efficiency of the whole on-ramp. Results in previous work have
shown that, if we can encourage a proper portion of mainline vehicles to bypass
rather than to stay steadfast, the social traffic conditions can be improved.
In this work, we consider employing a proportion of altruistic vehicles among
the selfish mainline vehicles to improve the efficiency of the on-ramps. The
altruistic vehicles are individual optimizers, making decisions whether to stay
steadfast or bypass to minimize their own altruistic cost, which is a weighted
sum of the travel delay and their negative impact on other vehicles. We first
consider the ideal case that altruistic costs can be perfectly measured by
altruistic vehicles. We give the conditions for the proportion of altruistic
vehicles and the weight configuration of the altruistic costs, under which the
social delay can be decreased or reach the optimal. Subsequently, we consider
the impact of uncertainty in the measurement of altruistic costs and we give
the optimal weight configuration for altruistic vehicles which minimizes the
worst-case social delay under such uncertainty.

environmental concern and environmentally responsible behavior. Younger and
more educated respondents tended to be more knowledgeable and concerned than
older and less educated respondents. The marginal effect of household size,
middle-income level income, and part-time employment status of the survey
respondents played a less significant role in the degree of environmental

answering (CQA) services. To balance the effectiveness and efficiency, the
question retrieval system is typically implemented as multi-stage rankers: The
first-stage ranker aims to recall potentially relevant questions from a large
repository, and the latter stages attempt to re-rank the retrieved results.
Most existing works on question retrieval mainly focused on the re-ranking
stages, leaving the first-stage ranker to some traditional term-based methods.
However, term-based methods often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem,
especially on short texts, which may block the re-rankers from relevant
questions at the very beginning. An alternative is to employ embedding-based
methods for the first-stage ranker, which compress texts into dense vectors to
enhance the semantic matching. However, these methods often lose the
discriminative power as term-based methods, thus introduce noise during
retrieval and hurt the recall performance. In this work, we aim to tackle the
dilemma of the first-stage ranker, and propose a discriminative semantic
ranker, namely DenseTrans, for high-recall retrieval. Specifically, DenseTrans
is a densely connected Transformer, which learns semantic embeddings for texts
based on Transformer layers. Meanwhile, DenseTrans promotes low-level features
through dense connections to keep the discriminative power of the learned
representations. DenseTrans is inspired by DenseNet in computer vision (CV),
but poses a new way to use the dense connectivity which is totally different
from its original design purpose. Experimental results over two question
retrieval benchmark datasets show that our model can obtain significant gain on
recall against strong term-based methods as well as state-of-the-art
embedding-based methods.

its local-search nature, however, theoretical guarantees on global optimality
often rely on extra assumptions on the Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that
bypass the challenge of global exploration. To eliminate the need of such
assumptions, in this work, we develop a general solution that adds dilated
bonuses to the policy update to facilitate global exploration. To showcase the
power and generality of this technique, we apply it to several episodic MDP
settings with adversarial losses and bandit feedback, improving and
generalizing the state-of-the-art. Specifically, in the tabular case, we obtain
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret where $T$ is the number of episodes,
improving the $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret bound by Shani et al.
(2020). When the number of states is infinite, under the assumption that the
state-action values are linear in some low-dimensional features, we obtain
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret with the help of a simulator,
matching the result of Neu and Olkhovskaya (2020) while importantly removing
the need of an exploratory policy that their algorithm requires. When a
simulator is unavailable, we further consider a linear MDP setting and obtain
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{14/15})$ regret, which is the first result for
linear MDPs with adversarial losses and bandit feedback.

typically large size of graphical data argues for the importance of designing
universal compression methods for such data. In most applications, the
graphical data is sparse, meaning that the number of edges in the graph scales
more slowly than $n^2$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices. Although in
some applications the number of edges scales linearly with $n$, in others the
number of edges is much smaller than $n^2$ but appears to scale superlinearly
with $n$. We call the former sparse graphs and the latter heavy-tailed sparse

Further, we outline a multiclass-to-binary (M2B) reduction framework that

name suggests, M2B works by reducing multiclass calibration to numerous binary
calibration problems, each of which can be solved using simple binary

histogram binning (HB) binary calibrator, and prove that the overall procedure
is multiclass calibrated without making any assumptions on the underlying data

performs almost identically to the naive best subset selection method but
reduces its computational complexity from $O(D)$ to $O(\sqrt{D}\log_2D)$, where

When the underlying regression model is linear, we propose a quantum linear

allows us to verify (with Probably Approximate Correctness guarantee) whether

Making side effect of speculative execution imperceptible to attackers, but it
often needs additional storage components and complicated data movement
operations. In this paper, we propose a label-based transparent speculation
scheme called SpecBox. It dynamically partitions the cache system to isolate
speculative data and non-speculative data, which can prevent transient
execution from being observed by subsequent execution. Moreover, it uses thread
ownership semaphores to prevent speculative data from being accessed across

locating the critical point and the phase boundary between the deconfined

the formation of dust rings is the accumulation of pebbles around the pressure
maximum, which is formed by the mass loss due to magnetically driven disk
winds. In evolving protoplanetary disks due to magnetically driven disk winds,
dust particles can migrate outwardly from the crystallization front to the

AMSGrad, and AdaBound), have been proposed to speed up the training process
with an element-wise scaling term on learning rates. However, they often
generalize poorly compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its
accelerated schemes such as SGD with momentum (SGDM). In this paper, we propose
a new adaptive method called DecGD, which simultaneously achieves good
generalization like SGDM and obtain rapid convergence like Adam-type methods.
In particular, DecGD decomposes the current gradient into the product of two
terms including a surrogate gradient and a loss based vector. Our method
adjusts the learning rates adaptively according to the current loss based
vector instead of the squared gradients used in Adam-type methods. The
intuition for adaptive learning rates of DecGD is that a good optimizer, in
general cases, needs to decrease the learning rates as the loss decreases,
which is similar to the learning rates decay scheduling technique. Therefore,
DecGD gets a rapid convergence in the early phases of training and controls the
effective learning rates according to the loss based vectors which help lead to
a better generalization. Convergence analysis is discussed in both convex and
non-convex situations. Finally, empirical results on widely-used tasks and
models demonstrate that DecGD shows better generalization performance than SGDM
and rapid convergence like Adam-type methods.

each node, where the corresponding representations are similar if two nodes are
closer to each other in the network. Meanwhile, there is another type of

applicable than marginal ones, they may suffer from slow mixing in infinite
mixtures, where some form of truncation, either deterministic or random, is
required. In mixtures with random number of components, the exploration of
parameter spaces of different dimensions can also be challenging. We tackle
these issues by expressing the mixture components in the random order of
appearance in an exchangeable sequence directed by the mixing distribution. We
derive a sampler that is straightforward to implement for mixing distributions
with tractable size-biased ordered weights, and that can be readily adapted to
mixture models for which marginal samplers are not available. In infinite
mixtures, no form of truncation is necessary. As for finite mixtures with
random dimension, a simple updating of the number of components is obtained by
a blocking argument, thus, easing challenges found in trans-dimensional moves
via Metropolis-Hastings steps. Additionally, sampling occurs in the space of
ordered partitions with blocks labelled in the least element order, which
endows the sampler with good mixing properties. The performance of the proposed
algorithm is evaluated in a simulation study.

noisy samples with fake labels, where the noise is added according to the
predictive uncertainty. The proposed method is efficient as it can make
decisions on-the-fly by utilizing only one randomly chosen model, but is also
effective as we show that it can be viewed as a non-Bayesian approximation of
Thompson sampling. Moreover, we extend it to an online version that can learn
solely from streaming data, which is favored in real applications. Extensive

adopt a recently developed mixed method, which decomposes the biharmonic

Using this idea, we design an efficient biharmonic eigenvalue algorithm, which

ubiquitous computation to numerous mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices
at the network edge. How to efficiently allocate geographically distributed
heterogeneous edge resources to a variety of services is a challenging task.
While this problem has been studied extensively in recent years, most of the
previous work has largely ignored the preferences of the services when making
edge resource allocation decisions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel
bilevel optimization model, which explicitly takes the service preferences into
consideration, to study the interaction between an EC platform and multiple
services. The platform manages a set of edge nodes (ENs) and acts as the leader
while the services are the followers. Given the service placement and resource
pricing decisions of the leader, each service decides how to optimally divide
its workload to different ENs. The proposed framework not only maximizes the
profit of the platform but also minimizes the cost of every service. When there
is a single EN, we derive a simple analytic solution for the underlying
problem. For the general case with multiple ENs and multiple services, we
present a Karush Kuhn Tucker based solution and a duality based solution,
combining with a series of linearizations, to solve the bilevel problem.
Extensive numerical results are shown to illustrate the efficacy of the
proposed model.

H2CN that has been largely ignored in chemical and astrochemical studies. The
observation of various unidentified lines around 72.2 GHz in the cold dark

groups of lines in harmonic relation. After an exhaustive high-level ab initio
screening of possible carriers, we confidently assign the unidentified lines to
H2NC based on the good agreement between astronomical and theoretical
spectroscopic parameters and sound spectroscopic and astrochemical arguments.
The observed frequencies are used to precisely characterize the rotational
spectrum of H2NC. This species is also detected in the cold dark cloud B1-b and
the z=0.89 galaxy in front of the quasar PKS1830-211. We derive H2NC/H2CN
abundance ratios of 1 in L483 and B1-b and 0.27 toward PKS1830-211. Neither
H2NC nor H2CN are detected in the dark cloud TMC-1, which seriously questions a
previous identification of H2CN in this source. We suggest that the H2NC/H2CN
ratio behaves as the HNC/HCN ratio, with values close to one in cold dense
clouds and below one in diffuse clouds. The reactions N + CH3 and C + NH3
emerge as strong candidates to produce H2NC in interstellar clouds. Further
studies on these two reactions are needed to evaluate the yield of H2NC. Due to
the small number of atoms involved, it should be feasible to constrain the
chemistry behind H2NC and H2CN, just as it has been done for HNC and HCN, as
this could allow to use the H2NC/H2CN ratio as a probe of chemical or physical

of the feature map, AS-MLP is able to obtain the information flow from
different axial directions, which captures the local dependencies. Such an

pipelines to compensate for the inevitable variability in object sizes, even

improved by gathering homogeneous points that have identical semantic

decoded via several simple convolution layers, where the parameters are
generated conditioned on the input. The proposed approach is proposal-free, and
instead exploits a convolution process that adapts to the spatial and semantic

bottleneck layer, allows the model to capture long-range dependencies, with
limited computational overhead. The result is a simple, efficient, and robust

Learning community. The task is challenging due to the sparse and discrete
nature of graph spaces. Several approaches have been proposed in the
literature, most of which require to transform the graphs into sequences that
encode their structure and labels and to learn the distribution of such
sequences through an auto-regressive generative model. Among this family of
approaches, we focus on the GraphGen model. The preprocessing phase of GraphGen
transforms graphs into unique edge sequences called Depth-First Search (DFS)
codes, such that two isomorphic graphs are assigned the same DFS code. Each
element of a DFS code is associated with a graph edge: specifically, it is a
quintuple comprising one node identifier for each of the two endpoints, their
node labels, and the edge label. GraphGen learns to generate such sequences
auto-regressively and models the probability of each component of the quintuple
independently. While effective, the independence assumption made by the model
is too loose to capture the complex label dependencies of real-world graphs
precisely. By introducing a novel graph preprocessing approach, we are able to
process the labeling information of both nodes and edges jointly. The
corresponding model, which we term GraphGen-Redux, improves upon the generative
performances of GraphGen in a wide range of datasets of chemical and social
graphs. In addition, it uses approximately 78% fewer parameters than the

spectrograph, for the 15 brightest targets of the previous study sample which
consists in 13 Sr-only stars and two Ba-only stars. Abundances were derived for
elements Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Fe, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, La, and Ce. Binarity
has been tested by comparing the Gaia DR2 radial velocity with the HERMES
velocity obtained 1600 - 1800 days later. Among the 15 programme stars, four
show no s-process overabundances ([X/Fe] < 0.2 dex), eight show mild s-process
overabundances (at least three heavy elements with 0.2 < [X/Fe] < 0.8), and
three have strong overabundances (at least three heavy elements with [X/Fe] >
0.8). Among the 13 stars classified as Sr-only by the previous investigation,
four have no s-process overabundances, eight are mild barium stars, and one is
a strong barium star. The two Ba-only stars turn out to be both strong barium
stars and are actually dwarf barium stars. They also show clear evidence for
being binaries. Among the no-s stars, there are two binaries out of four,
whereas only one out of the eight mild barium stars show a clear signature of
radial-velocity variations. Blending effects and saturated lines have to be
considered very carefully when using machine-learning techniques, especially on
low-resolution spectra. Among the Sr-only stars from the previous study sample,
one may expect about 60% (8/13) of them to be true mild barium stars and about
8% to be strong barium stars, and this fraction is likely close to 100% for the
previous study Ba-only stars (2/2).

Therefore, the global model's performance and convergence of the training

Agents observe the environment via textual descriptions designed to be
challenging enough for even human players. Past approaches have not paid enough
attention to the language understanding capability of the proposed agents.
Typically, these approaches train from scratch, an agent that learns both

patient-specified stiffness-based method to correct the tissue deformations in
robotic 3D US acquisitions. To obtain the patient-specified model, robotic
palpation is performed at sampling positions on the tissue. The contact force,
US images and the probe poses of the palpation procedure are recorded. The
contact force and the probe poses are used to estimate the nonlinear tissue
stiffness. The images are fed to an optical flow algorithm to compute the pixel
displacement. Then the pixel-wise tissue deformation under different forces is
characterized by a coupled quadratic regression. To correct the deformation at
unseen positions on the trajectory for building 3D volumes, an interpolation is
performed based on the stiffness values computed at the sampling positions.
With the stiffness and recorded force, the tissue displacement could be
corrected. The method was validated on two blood vessel phantoms with different

telecommunications, physics, genetics, neuroscience, and social sciences. A key
contribution of this paper is a nontrivial generalization of Neunzert's
in-cell-particle approach for all-to-all coupled indistinguishable IPS with
global Lipschitz continuity in Euclidean spaces to distinguishable IPS on
heterogeneous digraphs with local Lipschitz continuity, via a measure-theoretic
viewpoint. The approach together with the metrics is different from the known
techniques in $L^p$-functions using graphons and their generalization via
harmonic analysis of locally compact Abelian groups. Finally, to demonstrate
the wide applicability, we apply our results to various models in
higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces in epidemiology, ecology, and social
sciences.

excitation of the background majority atoms is mediated via the
majority-impurity interaction. The breathing spectrum is obtained for different
numbers of majority particles, several values of the majority-component
interaction strengths and trap ratios. It is further compared to the breathing
spectrum of a particle-balanced few-body Bose-Bose mixture. In particular, for
equal post-quench traps the employed protocol allows to couple states of
different center-of-mass parity in contrast to species-symmetric trap quenches.
Among the participating eigenstates we identify one having odd center-of-mass
parity and even global parity. The breathing frequency induced by this state is
a monotonically decreasing function of the coupling parameter. Importantly, in
order to be observable it requires the entanglement between the species to be
taken into account. We demonstrate this by comparing the numerically exact
results obtained by means of the Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent
Hartree Method for Mixtures to the ones of a species mean-field ansatz. The
entanglement-sensitive breathing frequency persists also for unequal
post-quench traps where the center-of-mass cannot be decoupled. Finally, we
analyze the impact of parity symmetry on the breathing dynamics by initializing
a state of odd global parity. We evidence a striking resemblance to the ground

their strong attenuation yet narrow frequency span. The latter limits the
practical ability to implement subwavelength band gaps for broadband
attenuation and has motivated novel metamaterial designs in recent years. In
this paper, we investigate the behavior of acoustic metamaterials where unit
cells house multiple resonating elements stacked in different configurations,
aimed at instigating a wide array of wave propagation profiles that are
otherwise unattainable. The dispersion mechanics of the multi-resonator
metamaterials are developed using purely analytical expressions which depict
and explain the underlying dynamics of such systems both at the unit cell level
as well as the frequency response of their finite realizations. The framework
reveals the mechanism behind the transition of the lower and upper band gap
bounds in metamaterials with parallel resonators resulting in a significant
band gap widening. The analysis also illustrates the ability of metamaterials
with dual-periodic super cells to exhibit a range of dispersion transitions
culminating in collapsing solutions of acoustic and optic bands, enabling a
coalescence of local resonance band gaps, vanishing resonances, and a number of
intriguing scenarios in between.

manipulating users' perception of the virtual environment via the head-mounted

lets users navigate discretely, skipping sections of the virtual space. Other
techniques are less extreme but still rely on controlling what and how much

Our focus is on two types of visual reduction techniques. This study aims to

occurs in a game, altering the chances of planning for a player. In this paper,
we refer to it as ""input-output randomness"". Input-output randomness is a
cornerstone of collectable card games like Hearthstone, in which cards are
drawn randomly (input randomness) and have random effects when played (output
randomness). While the topic might have been commonly discussed by game
designers and be present in many games, few empirical studies have been
performed to evaluate the effects of these different kinds of randomness on the
players' satisfaction. This research investigates the effects of input-output
randomness on collectable card games across four input-output randomness
conditions. We have developed our own collectable card game and experimented
with the different kinds of randomness with the game. Our results suggest that
input randomness can significantly impact game satisfaction negatively.

VR games as players are usually limited to experience the virtual world by
vision and hearing only. One prominent example of such open challenges is the
disparity between the real surroundings and the virtual environment. As virtual
obstacles usually do not have a physical counterpart, players might walk
through walls enclosing the level. Thus, past research mainly focussed on
multisensory collision feedback to deter players from ignoring obstacles.
However, the underlying causative reasons for such unwanted behavior have
mostly remained unclear.
  Our work investigates how task types and wall appearances influence the
players' incentives to walk through virtual walls. Therefore, we conducted a

walls of varying opacity and realism. Our evaluation reveals that players
generally adhere to realistic behavior, as long as the experience feels

deterring subjects from cutting short, whereas different degrees of realism had
no significant influence on walking trajectories. Finally, we use collected

general, experts classify sleep stages manually based on polysomnography (PSG),
which is quite time-consuming. Meanwhile, the acquisition process of multiple
signals is much complex, which can affect the subject's sleep. Therefore, the
use of single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) for automatic sleep staging
has become a popular research topic. In the literature, a large number of sleep
staging methods based on single-channel EEG have been proposed with promising
results and achieve the preliminary automation of sleep staging. However, the
performance for most of these methods in the N1 stage do not satisfy the needs
of the diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model multi scale
dual attention network(MSDAN) based on raw EEG, which utilizes multi-scale
convolution to extract features in different waveforms contained in the EEG
signal, connects channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms in series
to filter and highlight key information, and uses soft thresholding to remove
redundant information. Experiments were conducted using two datasets with
5-fold cross-validation and hold-out validation method. The final average
accuracy, overall accuracy, macro F1 score and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of the
model reach 96.70%, 91.74%, 0.8231 and 0.8723 on the Sleep-EDF dataset, 96.14%,

performed superiorly in the N1 stage, with F1 scores of 54.41% and 52.79% on

over the existing methods, reaching a new state-of-the-art. In particular, the
proposed method achieves excellent results in the N1 sleep stage compared to

a NLSM continuum model under strong magnetic field and report the

level as the field in a direction perpendicular to the nodal plane is varied
through. Based on the results on parallel magnetization, we demonstrate the
growth of quantum oscillation with field strength as well as its constancy in
period when plotted against 1/B. We find that the density of states which show
series of peaks in succession, witness bifurcation of those peaks due to Zeeman
effect. For field normal to nodal plane, such bifurcations are discernible only
if the electron effective mass is considerably smaller than its free value,
which usually happens in these systems. Though a reduced effective mass $m^*$
causes the Zeeman splitting to become small compared to Landau level spacing,
experimental results indicate a manyfold increase in the Lande $g$ factor which
again amplifies the Zeeman contribution. We also consider magnetic field in the
nodal plane for which the density of state peaks do not repeat periodically
with energy anymore. The spectra become more spread out and the Zeeman
splittings become less prominent. We find the low energy topological regime,
that appears with such in-plane field set up, to shrink further with reduced
$m^*$ values. However, such topological regime can be stretched out in case
there are smaller Fermi velocities for electrons in the direction normal to the
nodal plane.

variety of learning tasks where the data satisfy special properties that ease
the learning process. For example, tasks where the distance of the data from
the decision boundary is bounded away from zero. The basic and simple idea is
to consider partial concepts: these are functions that can be undefined on
certain parts of the space. When learning a partial concept, we assume that the
source distribution is supported only on points where the partial concept is
defined.
  This way, one can naturally express assumptions on the data such as lying on
a lower dimensional surface or margin conditions. In contrast, it is not at all
clear that such assumptions can be expressed by the traditional PAC theory. In
fact we exhibit easy-to-learn partial concept classes which provably cannot be
captured by the traditional PAC theory. This also resolves a question posed by
Attias, Kontorovich, and Mansour 2019.
  We characterize PAC learnability of partial concept classes and reveal an
algorithmic landscape which is fundamentally different than the classical one.
For example, in the classical PAC model, learning boils down to Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM). In stark contrast, we show that the ERM principle fails in
explaining learnability of partial concept classes. In fact, we demonstrate
classes that are incredibly easy to learn, but such that any algorithm that
learns them must use an hypothesis space with unbounded VC dimension. We also
find that the sample compression conjecture fails in this setting.
  Thus, this theory features problems that cannot be represented nor solved in
the traditional way. We view this as evidence that it might provide insights on
the nature of learnability in realistic scenarios which the classical theory
fails to explain.

Hermitian conjugate, is a central issue of non-Hermitian physics that has been
extensively studied in the past few years. There is, however, another
characteristic of a non-normal matrix that has often been overlooked: the
pseudospectrum, or the set of spectra under small perturbations. In this paper,
we study the dynamics driven by the non-normal matrix (Hamiltonian) realized as
a continuous quantum trajectory of the Lindblad master equation in open quantum
systems and point out that the dynamics can reveal the nature of unconventional
pseudospectrum of the non-normal Hamiltonian. In particular, we focus on the
transient dynamics of the norm of an unnormalized quantum state evolved with
the non-normal Hamiltonian, which is related to the probability for observing
the trajectory with no quantum jump. We formulate the transient suppression of
the decay rate of the norm due to the pseudospectral behavior and derive a
non-Hermitian/non-normal analog of the time-energy uncertainty relation. We
also consider two methods to experimentally realize the non-normal dynamics and
observe our theoretical findings on quantum computers: one uses a technique to
realize non-unitary operations on quantum circuits and the other leverages a
quantum-classical hybrid algorithm called variational quantum simulation. Our
demonstrations using cloud-based quantum computers provided by IBM Quantum
exhibit the frozen dynamics of the norm in transient time, which can be
regarded as a non-normal analog of the quantum Zeno effect.

introduce an operational approach, first with one friend and then with two
spatially separated friends, to test the validity of these two perceptions in
quantum theory without assuming the details of the experiment. First, we show
that the set of probabilities obtainable for NoM is strictly larger than the
set obtainable for AoM. We provide the simplest scenario so far, involving a
single quantum preparation and one unitary operation by a super-observer that
can demonstrate correlations incompatible with AoM. Remarkably, in the scenario

prediction, offering an advantage over regular neural networks that has not
been explored in the differential privacy (DP) framework. We fill this
important gap by leveraging recent development in Bayesian deep learning and
privacy accounting to offer a more precise analysis of the trade-off between
privacy and accuracy in BNN. We propose three DP-BNNs that characterize the
weight uncertainty for the same network architecture in distinct ways, namely
DP-SGLD (via the noisy gradient method), DP-BBP (via changing the parameters of
interest) and DP-MC Dropout (via the model architecture). Interestingly, we
show a new equivalence between DP-SGD and DP-SGLD, implying that some
non-Bayesian DP training naturally allows for uncertainty quantification.
However, the hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size, can have
different or even opposite effects in DP-SGD and DP-SGLD.
  Extensive experiments are conducted to compare DP-BNNs, in terms of privacy
guarantee, prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, calibration,
computation speed, and generalizability to network architecture. As a result,
we observe a new tradeoff between the privacy and the reliability. When
compared to non-DP and non-Bayesian approaches, DP-SGLD is remarkably accurate
under strong privacy guarantee, demonstrating the great potential of DP-BNN in
real-world tasks.

often required. In this context, Bayesian methods have become very popular in
several fields over the last years, in order to obtain parameter inversion,
model selection or uncertainty quantification. Bayesian inference requires the
approximation of complicated integrals involving (often costly) posterior
distributions. Generally, this approximation is obtained by means of Monte
Carlo (MC) methods. In order to reduce the computational cost of the
corresponding technique, surrogate models (also called emulators) are often
employed. Another alternative approach is the so-called Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC) scheme. ABC does not require the evaluation of the costly
model but the ability to simulate artificial data according to that model.
Moreover, in ABC, the choice of a suitable distance between real and artificial
data is also required. In this work, we introduce a novel approach where the
expensive model is evaluated only in some well-chosen samples. The selection of
these nodes is based on the so-called compressed Monte Carlo (CMC) scheme. We
provide theoretical results supporting the novel algorithms and give empirical
evidence of the performance of the proposed method in several numerical

function $\Psi$ of a non-degenerate real-valued random variable $X$ is of the
form $\exp(P(u))$ for some polynomial $P$, then $X$ has to be a Gaussian. In
this work, we obtain a broad, quantitative extension of this framework in
several directions, establish central limit theorems (CLTs) with explicit rates
of convergence, and demonstrate Gaussian fluctuations in continuous spin
systems and general classes of point processes. In particular, we obtain
quantitative decay estimates on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between $X$ and
a Gaussian under the condition that $\Psi$ does not vanish only on a bounded
disk. This leads to quantitative CLTs applicable to very general and possibly
strongly dependent random systems. In spite of the general applicability, our
rates for the CLT match the classic Berry-Esseen bounds for independent sums up
to a log factor. We implement this programme for two important classes of
models in probability and statistical physics. First, we extend to the setting
of continuous spins a popular paradigm for obtaining CLTs for discrete spin
systems that is based on the theory of Lee-Yang zeros, focussing in particular
on the XY model, Heisenberg ferromagnets and generalised Ising models.
Secondly, we establish Gaussian fluctuations for linear statistics of so-called
$\alpha$-determinantal processes for $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ (including the
usual determinantal, Poisson and permanental processes) under very general
conditions, including in particular higher dimensional settings where
structural alternatives such as random matrix techniques are not available. Our
applications demonstrate the significance of having to control the
characteristic function only on a (small) disk, and lead to CLTs which, to the

further compression efficiency by stacking and extending hierarchically

the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) leads to the fastest known algebraic
algorithms for many basic polynomial operations, such as multiplication,
division, interpolation and multi-point evaluation. However, the same
operations over fields with no smooth order root of unity suffer from an
asymptotic slowdown. The classical algorithm of Schonhage and Strassen incurred
a multiplicative slowdown factor of $\log \log n$ on top of the smooth case.
Recent remarkable results of Harvey, van der Hoeven and Lecerf dramatically
reduced this multiplicative overhead to $\exp(\log^* (n))$.
  We introduce a new approach to fast algorithms for polynomial operations over
all large finite fields. The key idea is to replace the group of roots of unity
with a set of points $L \subset F$ suitably related to a well-chosen elliptic
curve group (the set $L$ itself is not a group). The key advantage of this
approach is that elliptic curve groups can be of any size in the Hasse-Weil
interval $[q+1 \pm 2\sqrt{q}]$ and thus can have subgroups of large, smooth
order, which an FFT-like divide and conquer algorithm can exploit. Compare this
with multiplicative subgroups over whose order must divide $q-1$.
  For polynomials represented by their evaluation over subsets of $L$, we show
that multiplication, division, degree-computation, interpolation, evaluation
and Reed-Solomon encoding (also known as low-degree extension) with fixed
evaluation points can all be computed with arithmetic circuits of size similar
to what is achievable with the classical FFTs when the field size is special.
For several problems, this yields the asymptotically smallest known arithmetic
circuits even in the standard monomial representation of polynomials.

suppress large-scale density fluctuations like crystals, and yet possess no
Bragg peaks similar to liquids or glasses. Such systems have been discovered in
a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium physical and biological systems,
and are often endowed with novel physical properties. The mechanisms associated
with the emergence of disordered hyperuniformity in nonequilibrium systems, in
particular inherent structures are often not well understood, which we will
address from a topological perspective in this work. Specifically, we consider
a representative class of disordered inherent structures which are constructed
by continuously introducing randomly distributed topological defects
(dislocations and disclinations) often seen in colloidal systems and
atomic-scale two-dimensional materials. We demonstrate that these inherent
structures can be viewed as topological variants of ordered hyperuniform states
(such as crystals) linked through continuous topological transformation
pathways, which remarkably preserve hyperuniformity. Moreover, we develop a
continuum theory to demonstrate that the large-scale density fluctuations in
these inherent structures are mainly dominated by the elastic displacement
fields resulted from the topological defects, which at low defect
concentrations can be approximated as superposition of the displacement fields
associated with each individual defect (strain source). We rigorously
demonstrate that hyperuniformity is preserved as long as certain conditions
associated with the displacement fields are met. Our results also highlight the
importance of decoupling the positional degrees of freedom from the vibrational
degrees of freedom when looking for disordered hyperuniformity, since the
hyperuniformity property is often cloaked by thermal fluctuations.

The searcher begins at the origin and performs Brownian motion with diffusion

$r>0$, so that if it has failed to locate the target by the time the clock
rings, then its position is reset to the origin and it continues its search
anew from there. In dimension one, the target is considered located when the
process hits the point $a$, while in dimensions two and higher, one chooses an

that is formed from the as-grown crystal by cutting, grinding, polishing and
chemical etching, introduces various surface defects that penetrate deep into
the crystal affecting its natural structure. Defect penetration is attributed
to the fact that ultra-pure aluminum single crystals are soft and ductile with
a hardness in the range of 2~2.5 mho. This leads to lattice deformation,
resulting in a deviation from the crystallographic orientation of the final
device, affecting the diffraction intensity and an apparent shift in the Bragg
angle. In this work we investigate the influence of processing aluminum single
crystals by mechanical and chemical means using XRD and Rocking-Curve
broadening as a quantitative indication concerning the depth of the damage.
This is a preliminary step in supporting future work on the study of electrical
conduction in aluminum single crystals. Supplementing electrical conductivity
measurements of aluminum, quality assessment of defects in front cell aluminum
conductors can assist in designing novel low resistance aluminum conductors
replacing the currently widely used and relatively rare silver.

While it is
natural to expect that orbital composition and information about Bloch states
can be manipulated and transported, in analogy to the spin degree of freedom
extensively studied in past decades, it has been assumed that orbital quenching
by the crystal field prevents significant dynamics of orbital degrees of
freedom. However, recent studies reveal that an orbital current, given by the
flow of electrons with a finite orbital angular momentum, can be electrically
generated and transported in wide classes of materials despite the effect of
orbital quenching in the ground state. Orbital currents also play a fundamental
role in the mechanisms of other transport phenomena such as spin Hall effect
and valley Hall effect. Most importantly, it has been proposed that orbital
currents can be used to induce magnetization dynamics, which is one of the most
pivotal and explored aspects of magnetism. Here, we give an overview of recent
progress and the current status of research on orbital currents. We review
proposed physical mechanisms for generating orbital currents and discuss
candidate materials where orbital currents are manifest. We review recent
experiments on orbital current generation and transport and discuss various
experimental methods to quantify this elusive object at the heart of
$orbitronics$ $-$ an area which exploits the orbital degree of freedom as an
information carrier in solid-state devices.

from high resolution (e.g. 1-min or 1-sec) to low resolution (e.g. 15-, 30- or

can remove high-frequency components from time-series load profiles, making
them unsuitable for in-depth studies such as quasi-static power flow analysis

ProfileSR-GAN: a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based load profile
super-resolution (LPSR) framework for restoring high-frequency components lost
through the smoothing effect of the down-sampling process. The LPSR problem is
formulated as a Maximum-a-Prior problem. When training the ProfileSR-GAN
generator network, to make the generated profiles more realistic, we introduce
two new shape-related losses in addition to conventionally used content loss:
adversarial loss and feature-matching loss. Moreover, a new set of shape-based
evaluation metrics are proposed to evaluate the realisticness of the generated
profiles. Simulation results show that ProfileSR-GAN outperforms Mean-Square
Loss based methods in all shape-based metrics. The successful application in
NILM further demonstrates that ProfileSR-GAN is effective in recovering
high-resolution realistic waveforms.

(non-strict) inequalities -- equivalently, an intersection of $k$ (closed) half
spaces -- as an invariant. We present a sufficient condition -- solely in terms
of eigenvalues of the $A$-matrix -- for an $n$-dimensional linear dynamical
system to have a $k$-LI. Our proof of sufficiency is constructive, and we get a
procedure that computes a $k$-LI if the condition holds. We also present a
necessary condition, together with many example linear systems where either the
sufficient condition, or the necessary is tight, and which show that the gap
between the conditions is not easy to overcome. In practice, the gap implies
that using our procedure, we synthesize $k$-LI for a larger value of $k$ than

analyze the neural activity of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),
who experience characteristic differences in neural oscillatory activity. In
particular, we propose a novel SincNet-based neural network for detecting

inspected to detect which part of the EEG spectrum is used for predicting
emotions. We found that our system automatically learns the high-$\alpha$ (9-13

recognition, which found an association between these band suppressions and the
behavioral deficits observed in individuals with ASD. The improved
interpretability of SincNet is achieved without sacrificing performance in

patterns, such as censoring certain users, creating or destroying balances on
demand, destroying smart contracts, or injecting arbitrary code. These routines
turn an ERC20 token into an administrated token - the type of Ethereum smart
contract that we scrutinize in this research. We discover that many smart
contracts are administrated, and the owners of these tokens carry lesser social
and legal responsibilities compared to the traditional centralized actors that
those tokens intend to disrupt. This entails two major problems: a) the owners
of the tokens have the ability to quickly steal all the funds and disappear
from the market; and b) if the private key of the owner's account is stolen,
all the assets might immediately turn into the property of the attacker. We
develop a pattern recognition framework based on 9 syntactic features
characterizing administrated ERC20 tokens, which we use to analyze existing
smart contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. Our analysis of 84,062 unique
Ethereum smart contracts reveals that nearly 58% of them are administrated
ERC20 tokens, which accounts for almost 90% of all ERC20 tokens deployed on
Ethereum. To protect users from the frivolousness of unregulated token owners
without depriving the ability of these owners to properly manage their tokens,
we introduce SafelyAdministrated - a library that enforces a responsible
ownership and management of ERC20 tokens. The library introduces three
mechanisms: deferred maintenance, board of trustees and safe pause. We
implement and test SafelyAdministrated in the form of Solidity abstract
contract, which is ready to be used by the next generation of safely
administrated ERC20 tokens.

as an initialization for model fine-tuning. The fine-tuning is required because
the limited data present in smaller datasets is not adequate for action
recognition models to learn complex spatio-temporal features. Because the
clients present are often heterogeneous in their computing resources, we use an
asynchronous federated optimization and we further show a convergence bound. We
compare our approach to two baseline approaches: fine-tuning at the central
server (no clients) and fine-tuning using (heterogeneous) clients using
synchronous federated averaging. We empirically show on a testbed of
heterogeneous embedded devices that we can perform action recognition with
comparable accuracy to the two baselines above, while our asynchronous learning
