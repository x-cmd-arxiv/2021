matter (DM) detection has been recognized and a coherent formulation of the
DM-electron scattering in terms of the dielectric response of the target
material has been well established in literatures. In this paper, we put
relevant formulas into practical density functional theory (DFT) estimation of
the excitation event rates for the diamond and silicon semiconductor targets.
Moreover, we compare the event rates calculated from the energy loss functions
with and without the local field effects. For a consistency check of this
numerical method, we also compare the differential spectrum and detection reach
of the silicon with those computed with the $\mathtt{GPAW}$ code. It turns out
that this DFT approach is quite consistent and robust. As an interesting
extension, we also investigate the in-medium effect on the detection of the
solar-reflected DM flux in silicon-based detectors, where the screening effect
is found to be also remarkable in the optically thick regime, and to turn
insignificant in the optically thin regime, depending on the energies of the
reflected DM particles.

where each clause is a disjunction of at most $r$ literals. The objective is to
compute an assignment which satisfies as many of the clauses as possible. While
there are a large number of polynomial-time approximation algorithms for this
problem, we take the viewpoint of space complexity following [Biswas et al.,
Algorithmica 2021] and design sublinear-space approximation algorithms for the
problem.
  We show that the classical algorithm of [Lieberherr and Specker, JACM 1981]
can be implemented to run in $n^{O(1)}$ time while using $(\log{n})$ bits of
space. The more advanced algorithms use linear or semi-definite programming,
and seem harder to carry out in sublinear space. We show that a more recent
algorithm with approximation ratio $\sqrt{2}/2$ [Chou et al., FOCS 2020],
designed for the streaming model, can be implemented to run in time $n^{O(r)}$
using $O(r \log{n})$ bits of space. While known streaming algorithms for the
problem approximate optimum values and use randomization, our algorithms are
deterministic and can output the approximately optimal assignments in sublinear
space.
  For instances of Max $r$-SAT with planar incidence graphs, we devise a
factor-$(1 - \epsilon)$ approximation scheme which computes assignments in time
$n^{O(r / \epsilon)}$ and uses $\max\{\sqrt{n} \log{n}, (r / \epsilon)
\log^2{n}\}$ bits of space.

Land Use Suitability Analysis Tools. PyLUSAT is an open-source software package
that provides a series of tools (functions) to conduct various tasks in a
suitability modeling workflow. These tools were evaluated against comparable
tools in ArcMap 10.4 with respect to both accuracy and computational
efficiency. Results showed that PyLUSAT functions were two to ten times more
efficient depending on the job's complexity, while generating outputs with
similar accuracy compared to the ArcMap tools. PyLUSAT also features
extensibility and cross-platform compatibility. It has been used to develop
fourteen QGIS Processing Algorithms and implemented on a high-performance
computational cluster (HiPerGator at the University of Florida) to expedite the
process of suitability analysis. All these properties make PyLUSAT a
competitive alternative solution for urban planners/researchers to customize

with significant \emph{uncertainty}, e.g., via historical data, which can lead
to bad outcomes if ignored. To address this, we develop an algorithm to compute
minimax regret -- robust policies for RMABs. Our approach uses a double oracle
framework (oracles for \textit{agent} and \textit{nature}), which is often used
for single-process robust planning but requires significant new techniques to
accommodate the combinatorial nature of RMABs. Specifically, we design a deep
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, DDLPO, which tackles the combinatorial
challenge by learning an auxiliary ""$\lambda$-network"" in tandem with policy
networks per arm, greatly reducing sample complexity, with guarantees on
convergence. DDLPO, of general interest, implements our reward-maximizing agent
oracle. We then tackle the challenging regret-maximizing nature oracle, a
non-stationary RL challenge, by formulating it as a multi-agent RL problem

dimension-free bare (pure) simulation method, is the main goal of this paper.
Almost no assumptions (like convexity) on the set of constraints are needed,
within our discrete setup of arbitrary dimension, and our method is precise
(i.e., converges in the limit). As a side effect, we also derive an innovative
way of constructing new useful distances/divergences. To illustrate the core of
our approach, we present numerous solved cases. The potential for widespread
applicability is indicated, too; in particular, we deliver many recent
references for uses of the involved distances/divergences and entropies in
various different research fields (which may also serve as an interdisciplinary
interface).

issues of an efficient implementation of model predictive control (MPC) for the

obtain a tractable control problem that can be solved using only a few
iterations of the fast gradient method, we investigate different methods for
preconditioning the resulting optimization problem and relate our findings to
standard regularization techniques from cross-directional control. We summarize
the single- and multi-core implementations of our control algorithm on a

increase the stability of photon beams in synchrotron light sources.

obtains a lattice field analogue of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with
continuous time. The second method is based on investigation of general
elliptic families of solutions to the 2D Toda equation. We derive equations of

a lattice spacing $\eta$, together with a zero curvature representation for

identified by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) methods, with edges
connecting cortical and subcortical gray matter areas and weighted by fiber
strengths, measured by the number of the discovered fiber tracts along the
edge. We identify several ""single"" important edges in these braingraphs, whose
high or low weights imply the sex or the age of the subject observed. We call
these edges implicator edges since solely from their weight, one can infer the
sex of the subject with more than 67 \% accuracy or their age group with more
than 62\% accuracy. We argue that these brain connections are the most
important ones characterizing the sex or the age of the subjects. Surprisingly,
the edges implying the male sex are mostly located in the anterior parts of the
brain, while those implying the female sex are mostly in the posterior regions.
Additionally, most of the inter-hemispheric implicator edges are male ones,
while the intra-hemispheric ones are predominantly female edges. Our pioneering

conductance without external magnetic field. It requires both nontrivial band
topology and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking. In most cases, one could
break the TRS of time-reversal invariant topological materials to yield QAH
effect, which is essentially a topological phase transition. Conventional
topological phase transition induced by external field/stimulus needs a route
along which the bandgap closes and re-opens. Hence, the phase transition occurs
only when the magnitude of field/stimulus is larger than a critical value. In
this work we propose that using gapless surface states, the transition can
happen at arbitrarily weak (but finite) external field strength. This can be
regarded as an unconventional topological phase transition, where the bandgap
closing is guaranteed by bulk-edge correspondence and symmetries, while the
bandgap reopening is induced by external fields. We demonstrate this concept on
the 2D surface states of 3D topological insulators like $\rm Bi_2Se_3$, which
become 2D QAH insulators once a circularly polarized light is turned on,
according to van Vleck's effective Hamiltonian in Floquet time crystal theory.
The sign of quantized Chern number can be controlled via the chirality of the
light. This provides a convenient and dynamical approach to trigger topological
phase transitions and create QAH insulators.

Due to their mesostructure, these sheets feature quasi-mechanisms -- low-energy
local kinematic modes that are strongly favored over other deformations. In
sheets with non-uniform mesostructure, kinematic incompatibilities arise
between neighboring regions, causing out-of-plane buckling. The effective
continuum model is based on a geometric analysis of the sheets' unit cells and
their energetically favorable modes of deformation. Its major feature is the
construction of a strain energy that penalizes deviations from these preferred
modes of deformation. The effect of non-periodicity is entirely described
through the use of spatially varying geometric parameters in the model. Our
simulations capture the out-of-plane buckling that occurs in non-periodic
specimens and show good agreement with experiments. While we only consider one

leverages the IRS to rapidly vary the electromagnetic propagation environment

adversary doesn't need any knowledge about the legitimate channel. We

many drawbacks making the training process ineffective and time-consuming.
Alternative randomized learning does not use gradients but selects hidden node
parameters randomly. This makes the training process extremely fast. However,
the problem in randomized learning is how to determine the random parameters. A
recently proposed method uses autoencoders for unsupervised parameter learning.
This method showed superior performance on classification tasks. In this work,
we apply this method to regression problems, and, finding that it has some
drawbacks, we show how to improve it. We propose a learning method of
autoencoders that controls the produced random weights. We also propose how to
determine the biases of hidden nodes. We empirically compare autoencoder based

COVID-19. Inspired by such phenomena, we construct a two-layer multiplex
network for the coupled spread of a disease and conflicting opinions. We model
each process as a contagion. On one layer, we consider the concurrent evolution
of two opinions -- pro-physical-distancing and anti-physical-distancing -- that
compete with each other and have mutual immunity to each other. The disease
evolves on the other layer, and individuals are less likely (respectively, more
likely) to become infected when they adopt the pro-physical-distancing
(respectively, anti-physical-distancing) opinion. We develop approximations of
mean-field type by generalizing monolayer pair approximations to multilayer
networks; these approximations agree well with Monte Carlo simulations for a
broad range of parameters and several network structures. Through numerical
simulations, we illustrate the influence of opinion dynamics on the spread of
the disease from complex interactions both between the two conflicting opinions
and between the opinions and the disease. We find that lengthening the duration
that individuals hold an opinion may help suppress disease transmission, and we
demonstrate that increasing the cross-layer correlations or intra-layer
correlations of node degrees may lead to fewer individuals becoming infected
with the disease.

  Correction",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tree Search (TS) is crucial to some of the most influential successes in
reinforcement learning. Here, we tackle two major challenges with TS that limit
its usability: \textit{distribution shift} and \textit{scalability}. We first
discover and analyze a counter-intuitive phenomenon: action selection through
TS and a pre-trained value function often leads to lower performance compared
to the original pre-trained agent, even when having access to the exact state
and reward in future steps. We show this is due to a distribution shift to
areas where value estimates are highly inaccurate and analyze this effect using
Extreme Value theory. To overcome this problem, we introduce a novel off-policy
correction term that accounts for the mismatch between the pre-trained value
and its corresponding TS policy by penalizing under-sampled trajectories. We
prove that our correction eliminates the above mismatch and bound the
probability of sub-optimal action selection. Our correction significantly
improves pre-trained Rainbow agents without any further training, often more
than doubling their scores on Atari games. Next, we address the scalability
issue given by the computational complexity of exhaustive TS that scales
exponentially with the tree depth. We introduce Batch-BFS: a GPU breadth-first
search that advances all nodes in each depth of the tree simultaneously.
Batch-BFS reduces runtime by two orders of magnitude and, beyond inference,
enables also training with TS of depths that were not feasible before. We train
DQN agents from scratch using TS and show improvement in several Atari games
compared to both the original DQN and the more advanced Rainbow.

on $\mathbb{R}^d$ have found extensive applications in both machine learning
and statistics. In practice, these maps need to be estimated from data sampled
according to $\mu$ and $\nu$. Plug-in estimators are perhaps most popular in
estimating transport maps in the field of computational optimal transport. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the rates of convergences
for general plug-in estimators defined via barycentric projections. Our main
contribution is a new stability estimate for barycentric projections which
proceeds under minimal smoothness assumptions and can be used to analyze
general plug-in estimators. We illustrate the usefulness of this stability
estimate by first providing rates of convergence for the natural
discrete-discrete and semi-discrete estimators of optimal transport maps. We
then use the same stability estimate to show that, under additional smoothness
assumptions of Besov type or Sobolev type, wavelet based or kernel smoothed
plug-in estimators respectively speed up the rates of convergence and
significantly mitigate the curse of dimensionality suffered by the natural
discrete-discrete/semi-discrete estimators. As a by-product of our analysis, we
also obtain faster rates of convergence for plug-in estimators of
$W_2(\mu,\nu)$, the Wasserstein distance between $\mu$ and $\nu$, under the
aforementioned smoothness assumptions, thereby complementing recent results in
Chizat et al. (2020). Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our results
in obtaining rates of convergence for Wasserstein barycenters between two
probability distributions and obtaining asymptotic detection thresholds for
some recent optimal-transport based tests of independence.

from the self-amplification of strain rate via a quadratic nonlinearity, with

pressure Hessian tensor, which we analyze here using direct numerical
simulations of isotropic turbulence in periodic domains of up to $12288^3$ grid
points, and Taylor-scale Reynolds numbers in the range $140-1300$. We extract
the statistics of various terms involved in amplification of strain and
additionally condition them on the magnitude of strain. We find that strain is
overall self-amplified by the quadratic nonlinearity, and depleted via vortex
stretching; whereas pressure Hessian acts to redistribute strain fluctuations
towards the mean-field and thus depleting intense strain. Analyzing the intense
fluctuations of strain in terms of its eigenvalues reveals that the net
amplification is solely produced by the third eigenvalue, resulting in strong
compressive action. In contrast, the self-amplification terms acts to deplete
the other two eigenvalues, whereas vortex stretching acts to amplify them, both
effects canceling each other almost perfectly. The effect of the pressure
Hessian for each eigenvalue is qualitatively similar to that of vortex
stretching, but significantly weaker in magnitude. Our results conform with the
familiar notion that intense strain is organized in sheet-like structures,
which are in the vicinity of, but never overlap with regions of intense

MaxSNP-completeness for NP optimization problems (Papadimitriou, Yannakakis,

a number of natural optimization problems in P, including Maximum Inner
Product, general forms of nearest neighbor search and optimization variants of
the $k$-XOR problem. Specifically, we define MaxSP as the class of problems
definable as $\max_{x_1,\dots,x_k} \#\{ (y_1,\dots,y_\ell) :
\phi(x_1,\dots,x_k, y_1,\dots,y_\ell) \}$, where $\phi$ is a quantifier-free
first-order property over a given relational structure (with MinSP defined
analogously). On $m$-sized structures, we can solve each such problem in time
$O(m^{k+\ell-1})$. Our results are:
  - We determine (a sparse variant of) the Maximum/Minimum Inner Product
problem as complete under *deterministic* fine-grained reductions: A strongly
subquadratic algorithm for Maximum/Minimum Inner Product would beat the
baseline running time of $O(m^{k+\ell-1})$ for *all* problems in MaxSP/MinSP by
a polynomial factor.
  - This completeness transfers to approximation: Maximum/Minimum Inner Product
is also complete in the sense that a strongly subquadratic $c$-approximation
would give a $(c+\varepsilon)$-approximation for all MaxSP/MinSP problems in
time $O(m^{k+\ell-1-\delta})$, where $\varepsilon > 0$ can be chosen
arbitrarily small. Combining our completeness with~(Chen, Williams, SODA 2019),
we obtain the perhaps surprising consequence that refuting the OV Hypothesis is
*equivalent* to giving a $O(1)$-approximation for all MinSP problems in
faster-than-$O(m^{k+\ell-1})$ time.

exactly the desired Hebbian updates. We provide expressions whose gradients
exactly implement a plain Hebbian rule (dw ~= xy), Grossberg's instar rule (dw

convolutional multi-layer networks for object recognition. We observe that
higher layers of such networks tend to learn large, simple features (Gabor-like
filters and blobs), explaining the previously reported decrease in decoding
performance over successive layers. To combat this tendency, we introduce
interventions (denser activations with sparse plasticity, pruning of
connections between layers) which result in sparser learned features, massively
increase performance, and allow information to increase over successive layers.

consider the spanning trees analysis which is a recently emerging idea for use
with the pairwise comparison approach that represents the plurality of mindsets
(in terms of a plurality of vectors corresponding to different spanning trees).
Until now, the multiplicity of the vectors supplied by the spanning trees
approach have been amalgamated into a single preference vector, losing the
information about the plurality of mindsets. To preserve this information, we
propose a novel methodology taking an approach similar to Stochastic
Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis. Considering all the rankings of
alternatives corresponding to the different mindsets, our methodology gives the
probability that an alternative attains a given ranking position as well as the
probability that an alternative is preferred to another one. Since the
exponential number of spanning trees makes their enumeration prohibitive, we
propose computing approximate probabilities using statistical sampling of the
spanning trees. Our approach is also appealing because it can be applied also
to incomplete sets of pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate its usefulness with

representations living approximately around low-dimensional submanifold
structures. In particular, hidden substructure is expected to arise when the

communities within the network might generate community-specific submanifold

statistical models for networks. In this article, a class of models called
latent structure block models (LSBM) is proposed to address such scenarios,
allowing for graph clustering when community-specific one dimensional manifold

the random dot product graph (RDPG), and assign a latent submanifold to the
latent positions of each community. A Bayesian model for the embeddings arising
from LSBMs is discussed, and shown to have a good performance on simulated and
real world network data. The model is able to correctly recover the underlying
communities living in a one-dimensional manifold, even when the parametric form
of the underlying curves is unknown, achieving remarkable results on a variety

concludes that pressure has a significant impact on melt pool aspect ratio. The
HPLM system thus enables careful study pressure effects on processing of common

arithmetic operations. Motivated by the ability to disentangle images into
spatial anatomy (tensor) factors and accompanying imaging (vector)
representations, we propose a framework termed ""disentangled anatomy
arithmetic"", in which a generative model learns to combine anatomical factors
of different input images such that when they are re-entangled with the desired
imaging modality (e.g. MRI), plausible new cardiac images are created with the
target characteristics. To encourage a realistic combination of anatomy factors

flows, via coherent structure-based models, are highly sensitive to the
geometry of the representative structures employed by them. In this study, we
propose a methodology to extract the three-dimensional (3-D) geometry of the
statistically significant eddies from multi-point wall-turbulence datasets, for
direct implementation into these models to improve their predictions. The
methodology is employed here for reconstructing a 3-D statistical picture of
the inertial wall coherent turbulence for all canonical wall-bounded flows,
across a decade of friction Reynolds number ($Re_{\tau}$). These structures are
responsible for the $Re_{\tau}$-dependence of the skin-friction drag and also
facilitate the inner-outer interactions, making them key targets of
structure-based models. The empirical analysis brings out the geometric
self-similarity of the large-scale wall-coherent motions and also suggests the
hairpin packet as the representative flow structure for all wall-bounded flows,
thereby aligning with the framework on which the attached eddy model (AEM) is
based. The same framework is extended here to also model the very-large-scaled
motions, with a consideration of their differences in internal versus external
flows. Implementation of the empirically-obtained geometric scalings for these
large structures into the AEM is shown to enhance the instantaneous flow
predictions for all three velocity components. Finally, an active flow control
system driven by the same geometric scalings is conceptualized, towards
favourably altering the influence of the wall coherent motions on the
skin-friction drag.

This includes, for example: optimization, optimal probability and Viterbi
decoding, probabilistic marginalization, logical inference, fuzzy sets,
differentiable softmax, and relational and provenance queries. The approach,
building on many ideas from the existing literature on constructive
algorithmics, exploits generic properties of (semiring) polymorphic functions,
tupling and formal sums (lifting), and algebraic simplifications arising from
constraint algebras. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this formalism for

agent to learn from a fixed offline dataset of logged interactions, which has
already been gathered, without offering further possibility for data
collection. However, commonly used off-policy RL algorithms, such as the Deep Q
Network and the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, are incapable of learning
without data correlated to the distribution under the current policy, making
them ineffective for this offline setting. As the first step towards useful
offline RL algorithms, we analysis the reason of instability in standard
off-policy RL algorithms. It is due to the bootstrapping error. The key to
avoiding this error, is ensuring that the agent's action space does not go out
of the fixed offline dataset. Based on our consideration, a creative offline RL
framework, the Least Restriction (LR), is proposed in this paper. The LR
regards selecting an action as taking a sample from the probability
distribution. It merely set a little limit for action selection, which not only
avoid the action being out of the offline dataset but also remove all the
unreasonable restrictions in earlier approaches (e.g. Batch-Constrained Deep
Q-Learning). In the further, we will demonstrate that the LR, is able to learn
robustly from different offline datasets, including random and suboptimal
demonstrations, on a range of practical control tasks.

such a dynamical process is a process that a metastable equilibrium state
evolves into the most stable symmetry broken equilibrium state. Metastable and
the most stable equilibrium states in the symmetry broken phase or ordered

submanifolds express hysteresis and pseudo-free energy curves. Singularities
associated with phase transitions are naturally arose in this framework as has
been suggested by Legendre singularity theory. Then a particular contact
Hamiltonian vector field is proposed so that a pruned segment of the projected
Legendre submanifold is a stable fixed point set in a region of a contact
manifold, and that another pruned segment is a unstable fixed point set. This
contact Hamiltonian vector field is identified with a dynamical process

luminosity is significantly lower than the results of a previous analytical

conclude that the former is unlikely with current technology, unless the SMS

due to its excellent power and economy. Due to unmanned tracked vehicles have
no traditional driving devices, and the driving cycle is uncertain, it brings
new challenges to conventional energy management strategies. This paper
proposes a novel energy management strategy for unmanned tracked vehicles based
on local speed planning. The contributions are threefold. Firstly, a local
speed planning algorithm is adopted for the input of driving cycle prediction
to avoid the dependence of traditional vehicles on driver's operation.
Secondly, a prediction model based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Long
Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) is proposed, which is used to process both the
planned and the historical velocity series to improve the prediction accuracy.
Finally, based on the prediction results, the model predictive control
algorithm is used to realize the real-time optimization of energy management.
The validity of the method is verified by simulation using collected data from
actual field experiments of our unmanned tracked vehicle. Compared with
multi-step neural networks, the prediction model based on CNN-LSTM improves the
prediction accuracy by 20%. Compared with the traditional regular energy
management strategy, the energy management strategy based on model predictive
control reduces fuel consumption by 7%.

between two coordinates, between a coordinate and an unattempted spot, and
between two unattempted spots. This asymptotic scenario in the generic

nice presentations of the Hecke algebra of connected, reductive groups with

group of groups $G$ that split over an unramified extension of $F$.
  The first main result of this paper is a presentation of the Hecke algebra
$\mathcal H(G(F),I_n)$, generalizing the previous work of Iwahori-Matsumoto on
the affine Hecke algebras. For split $GL_n$, Howe gave a refined presentation

presentation to other groups requires the existence of some nice lifting of the
Iwahori-Weyl group $W$ to $G(F)$. The study of a certain nice lifting of $W$ is
the second main motivation of this paper, which we discuss below.
  In 1966, Tits introduced a certain subgroup of $G(\mathbf k)$, which is an
extension of $W$ by an elementary abelian $2$-group. This group is called the
Tits group and provides a nice lifting of the elements in the finite Weyl
group. The ""Tits group"" $\mathcal T$ for the Iwahori-Weyl group $W$ is a
certain subgroup of $G(F)$, which is an extension of the Iwahori-Weyl group $W$
by an elementary abelian $2$-group. The second main result of this paper is a
construction of Tits group $\mathcal T$ for $W$ when $G$ splits over an
unramified extension of $F$. As a consequence, we generalize Howe's
presentation to such groups. We also show that when $G$ is ramified over $F$,
such a group $\mathcal T$ of $W$ may not exist.

unambiguously disentangle the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) of a permalloy film. We find that the
scattering-independent intrinsic contribution to AMR is sizable and is as large
as the scattering-dependent extrinsic contribution to AMR. Moreover, the
portion of intrinsic contribution to total AMR increases with increasing
temperature due to the reduction of extrinsic contribution. Further
investigation reveals that the reduction of extrinsic contribution is caused by
the phonon/magnon-induced negative AMR. Our result will stimulate further
researches on other spin-orbit-interaction-induced phenomena for which
identifying the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions is important.

Chain Monte Carlo method, we show that star formation in this BCG has persisted
at a relatively constant rate of $\sim2{\rm\,M_\sun\,yr^{-1}}$ (factors of
10--40 below the rates previously inferred using simpler methods and/or ad hoc
assumptions) over the past $\sim$400\,Myr, beyond which any star formation
falls below the observational detection threshold. Such persistent star
formation from a residual cooling flow can contribute up to $\sim$10\% of the
original stellar mass of this BCG if its progenitor was among the most massive
red nuggets known at $z\sim$2 having masses of $\sim1\times10^{11}\rm\,M_\sun$,
but only a few percent of its overall growth in stellar mass to
$\sim8\times10^{11}\rm\,M_\sun$ at $z=0.45$. Although constituting only a minor
pathway for the stellar growth of this BCG, persistent star formation from a
residual cooling flow can nevertheless contribute significantly to the enormous
number of globular clusters found around BCGs in the local Universe.

process of massive stars by acting against gravitational collapse onto the
central protostar. However, dust properties in dense regions irradiated by the
intense radiation of massive protostars are poorly constrained. Previous
studies usually assume the standard interstellar dust model to constrain the
maximum mass of massive stars formed by accretion, which appears to contradict
with dust evolution theory. In this paper, using the fact that stellar
radiation exerts on dust simultaneous radiation pressure and radiative torques,
we study the effects of grain rotational disruption by radiative torques (RATs)
on radiation pressure and explore its implications for massive star formation.
For this paper, we focus on the protostellar envelope and adopt a spherical
geometry. We find that original large grains of micron-sizes presumably formed
in very dense regions can be rapidly disrupted into small grains by RATs due to
infrared radiation from the hot dust shell near the sublimation front induced
by direct stellar radiation. Owing to the modification in the size distribution
by rotational disruption, the radiation pressure opacity can be decreased by a
factor of $\sim 3$ from the value expected from the original dust model.
However, to form massive stars via spherical accretion, the dust-to-gas mass
ratio needs to be reduced by a factor of $\sim 5$ as previously found.

nonlinear, which poses unique statistical challenges. Empirical researchers
often select a nonlinear longitudinal model by weighing how specific the model
must be in terms of the nature of the nonlinearity, whether the model is
computationally efficient, and whether the model provides interpretable
coefficients. Latent basis growth models (LBGMs) are one method that can get
around these tradeoffs: it does not require specification of any functional
form; additionally, its estimation process is expeditious, and estimates are
straightforward to interpret. We propose a novel specification for LBGMs that
allows for (1) unequally-spaced study waves and (2) individual measurement
occasions around each wave. We then extend LBGMs to explore multiple repeated
outcomes because longitudinal processes rarely unfold in isolation. We present
the proposed model by simulation studies and real-world data analyses. Our
simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed model can provide unbiased and
accurate estimates with target coverage probabilities of a 95% confidence
interval for the parameters of interest. With the real-world analyses using
longitudinal reading and mathematics scores, we demonstrate that the proposed
parallel LBGM can capture the underlying developmental patterns of these two
abilities and that the novel specification of LBGMs is helpful in joint
development where longitudinal processes have different time structures. We
also provide the corresponding code for the proposed model.

an incident acoustic field. The geometric details of manipulated particles are
often neglected by replacing them with equivalent symmetric geometries such as
spheres, spheroids, cylinders or disks. It has been demonstrated that geometric
asymmetry, represented by Willis coupling terms, can strongly affect the
scattering of a small object, hence neglecting these terms may miss important
force contributions. In this work, we present a generalized formalism of
acoustic radiation force and radiation torque based on the polarizability
tensor, where Willis coupling terms are included to account for geometric
asymmetry. Following Gorkov's approach, the effects of geometric asymmetry are
explicitly formulated as additional terms in the radiation force and torque
expressions. By breaking the symmetry of a sphere along one axis using
intrusion and protrusion, we characterize the changes in the force and torque
in terms of partial components, associated with the direct and Willis Coupling
coefficients of the polarizability tensor. We investigate in detail the cases
of standing and travelling plane waves, showing how the equilibrium positions
and angles are shifted by these additional terms. We show that while the
contributions of asymmetry to the force are often negligible for small
particles, these terms greatly affect the radiation torque. Our presented
theory, providing a way of calculating radiation force and torque directly from
polarizability coefficients, shows that in general it is essential to account
for shape of objects undergoing acoustophoretic manipulation, and this may have
important implications for applications such as the manipulation of biological
cells.

is that the model accuracy usually degrades when the model is simplified to

depth quality is a key factor influencing the accuracy, we propose a novel
depth quality-inspired feature manipulation (DQFM) process, which is efficient
itself and can serve as a gating mechanism for filtering depth features to

Second, we show that basic data mining operations can significantly improve the

describes the joint moments of the conformal radii of loops surrounding three

imaginary DOZZ formula due to Zamolodchikov (2005) and Kostov-Petkova (2007),
which is the three-point structure constant of certain conformal field theories

is for the moments of the electrical thickness of CLE loops first considered by
Kenyon and Wilson (2004). Our proofs rely on the conformal welding of random
surfaces and two sources of integrability concerning CLE and Liouville quantum
gravity (LQG). First, LQG surfaces decorated with CLE inherit a rich integrable
structure from random planar maps decorated with the O(n) loop model. Second,
as the field theory describing LQG, Liouville conformal field theory is
integrable. In particular, the DOZZ formula and the FZZ formula for its

superconductivity was recently achieved in Sr-doped NdNiO2 on SrTiO3 substrate.
Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that stoichiometric
NdNiO2 is significantly unstable with respect to decomposition into 1/2[Nd2O3 +
NiO + Ni] with exothermic decomposition energy of +176 meV/atom, a considerably
higher instability than that for common ternary oxides. This poses the question
if the stoichiometric NdNiO2 nickelate compound used extensively to model the
electronic band structure of Ni-based oxide analog to cuprates and found to be
metallic is the right model for this purpose. To examine this, we study via DFT
the role of the common H impurity expected to be present in the process of
chemical reduction needed to obtain NdNiO2. We find that H can be incorporated
exothermically, i.e., spontaneously in NdNiO2, even from H2 gas. In the
concentrated limit, such impurities can result in the formation of a hydride
compound NdNiO2H, which has significantly reduced instability relative to
hydrogen-free NdNiO2. Interestingly, the hydrogenated form has a similar
lattice constant as the pure form (leading to comparable XRD patterns), but
unlike the metallic character of NdNiO2, the hydrogenated form is predicted to
be a wide gap insulator thus, requiring doping to create a metallic or
superconducting state, just like cuprates, but unlike unhydrogenated
nickelates. While it is possible that hydrogen would be eventually desorbed,
the calculation suggests that pristine NdNiO2 is hydrogen-stabilized. One must
exercise caution with theories predicting new physics in pristine
stoichiometric NdNiO2 as it might be an unrealizable compound. Experimental
examination of the composition of real NdNiO2 superconductors and the effect of
hydrogen on the superconductivity is called for.

a reduction in the final secret key rate. Simultaneously, we propose an

Networks (SNNs) without decreasing the accuracy significantly is quantization.
However, the state-of-the-art only focus on employing the weight quantization
directly from a specific quantization scheme, i.e., either the post-training
quantization (PTQ) or the in-training quantization (ITQ), and do not consider
(1) quantizing other SNN parameters (e.g., neuron membrane potential), (2)
exploring different combinations of quantization approaches (i.e., quantization
schemes, precision levels, and rounding schemes), and (3) selecting the SNN
model with a good memory-accuracy trade-off at the end. Therefore, the memory
saving offered by these state-of-the-art to meet the targeted accuracy is
limited, thereby hindering processing SNNs on the resource-constrained systems
(e.g., the IoT-Edge devices). Towards this, we propose Q-SpiNN, a novel
quantization framework for memory-efficient SNNs. The key mechanisms of the
Q-SpiNN are: (1) employing quantization for different SNN parameters based on
their significance to the accuracy, (2) exploring different combinations of
quantization schemes, precision levels, and rounding schemes to find efficient
SNN model candidates, and (3) developing an algorithm that quantifies the
benefit of the memory-accuracy trade-off obtained by the candidates, and
selects the Pareto-optimal one. The experimental results show that, for the
unsupervised network, the Q-SpiNN reduces the memory footprint by ca. 4x, while
maintaining the accuracy within 1% from the baseline on the MNIST dataset. For
the supervised network, the Q-SpiNN reduces the memory by ca. 2x, while keeping
the accuracy within 2% from the baseline on the DVS-Gesture dataset.

uncovered a surprising finding: when conducting ablation studies on existing
pruning-at-initialization methods, namely SNIP, GraSP, SynFlow, and magnitude

improve when randomly shuffling the mask positions within each layer (Layerwise
Shuffling) or sampling new initial weight values (Reinit), while keeping
pruning masks the same. We attempt to understand the reason behind such network
immunity towards weight/mask modifications, by studying layer-wise statistics
before and after randomization operations. We found that under each of the

the photoexcited graphene monolayer that leads to the amplification of surface

Anderson localization of the SPP waves propagating through the graphene

shown that the enhancement factor of the resonant peaks corresponding to the

intensity distributions along the graphene monolayer and find out that their
intensities and localization positions are different from each other. By
investigating the pump dependent and temperature dependent variations of the

Also, we show that increasing the ambient temperature by 60 K can dramatically
reduce the output amplified intensity by a factor of 70. This property of the

functionals, were introduced by Loeliger and Vontobel [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory,
2017, 2020] as a generalization of probability mass functions toward modeling
quantum information processing setups in terms of factor graphs.
  Simple quantum mass functions (SQMFs) are a special class of QMFs that do not
explicitly model classical random variables. Nevertheless, classical random
variables appear implicitly in an SQMF if some marginals of the SQMF satisfy
some conditions; variables of the SQMF corresponding to these ""emerging"" random
variables are called classicable variables. Of particular interest are jointly
classicable variables.
  In this paper we initiate the characterization of the set of marginals given
by the collection of jointly classicable variables of a graphical model and
compare them with other concepts associated with graphical models like the sets
of realizable marginals and the local marginal polytope.
  In order to further characterize this set of marginals given by the
collection of jointly classicable variables, we generalize the CHSH inequality
based on the Pearson correlation coefficients, and thereby prove a conjecture
proposed by Pozsgay et al. A crucial feature of this inequality is its
nonlinearity, which poses difficulties in the proof.

wind or the outer layers of a broadened jet or a combination of both. The

kpc-scale lobe emission that is misaligned with the primary lobes in the uGMRT

are similar to the primary lobe, suggesting that the misaligned lobe is not a

subsequent intermittent behaviour of the outflow, along with the close

To exhibit the power of the models, we apply them to explain the dynamic light

interference at the Fano resonances. We observe and explain intensive sharp
spikes in scattering cross section just behind the leading and trailing edges

explained by the electromagnetic energy released in the particle at the
previous scattering stages. The accuracy of the models is checked against their

Given the total amount of energy stored in a quantum system, quantifying wasted
energy after the ergotropy extraction is a question to be considered when
undesired coupling with thermal reservoirs is taken into account. In this
paper, we show that some amount of energy can be lost when we extract ergotropy
from a quantum system and quantified by the exergy of passive states. Through a

object the user likely wants to grasp. This architecture allows the approach to
rely on traded control instead of direct control: we use hand gestures to
specify the goal objects for a sequential manipulation task, the robot then
autonomously generates a grasping or a retrieving motion using trajectory
optimization. The perception module relies on the model-based tracker to
precisely track the 6D pose of the objects and makes use of a state of the art
learning-based object detection and segmentation method, to initialize the
tracker by automatically detecting objects in the scene. Goal objects are
identified from user hand gestures using a trained a multi-layer perceptron
classifier. After presenting all the components of the system and their
empirical evaluation, we present experimental results comparing our pipeline to
a direct traded control approach (i.e., one that does not use prediction) which
shows that using intent prediction allows to bring down the overall task

structured data, and extracting insights from structured data requires advanced
analytics. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved super-human prediction
performance in particular data types, e.g., images. However, existing DNNs may
not produce meaningful results when applied to structured data. The reason is
that there are correlations and dependencies across combinations of attribute
values in a table, and these do not follow simple additive patterns that can be
easily mimicked by a DNN. The number of possible such cross features is
combinatorial, making them computationally prohibitive to model. Furthermore,
the deployment of learning models in real-world applications has also
highlighted the need for interpretability, especially for high-stakes
applications, which remains another issue of concern to DNNs.
  In this paper, we present ARM-Net, an adaptive relation modeling network
tailored for structured data, and a lightweight framework ARMOR based on
ARM-Net for relational data analytics. The key idea is to model feature
interactions with cross features selectively and dynamically, by first
transforming the input features into exponential space, and then determining
the interaction order and interaction weights adaptively for each cross
feature. We propose a novel sparse attention mechanism to dynamically generate
the interaction weights given the input tuple, so that we can explicitly model
cross features of arbitrary orders with noisy features filtered selectively.
Then during model inference, ARM-Net can specify the cross features being used
for each prediction for higher accuracy and better interpretability. Our
extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ARM-Net
consistently outperforms existing models and provides more interpretable
predictions for data-driven decision making.

which treats it as viscoelastic fluid. We consider the specific cases of
rotating vorticity with abrupt radial profiles of rotation. In particular:
single-circulation, and multi-circulation vorticity shell profiles have been
chosen. We observe the KH vortices at each circular interface between two
relative rotating flows along with a pair of ingoing and outgoing wavefronts of
transverse shear waves. Our studies show that due to the interplay between KH
vortices and shear waves in the strongly coupled medium, the mixing and
transport behaviour are much better than inviscid hydrodynamic fluids. In
interests of substantiating the mixing and transport behaviour, the generalized
hydrodynamic fluid model is extended to include the Lagrangian tracer
particles. The numerical dispersion of these tracer particles in a flow

preliminary observations of tracers distribution (cluster formation) and their

gradient method~(NAG), have been widely used in training neural networks by
incorporating the history of gradients into the current updating process. In
practice, they often provide improved performance over (stochastic) gradient
descent~(GD) with faster convergence. Despite these empirical successes,
theoretical understandings of their accelerated convergence rates are still
lacking. Recently, some attempts have been made by analyzing the trajectories
of gradient-based methods in an over-parameterized regime, where the number of
the parameters is significantly larger than the number of the training
instances. However, the majority of existing theoretical work is mainly
concerned with GD and the established convergence result of NAG is inferior to
HB and GD, which fails to explain the practical success of NAG. In this paper,
we take a step towards closing this gap by analyzing NAG in training a randomly
initialized over-parameterized two-layer fully connected neural network with
ReLU activation. Despite the fact that the objective function is non-convex and
non-smooth, we show that NAG converges to a global minimum at a non-asymptotic
linear rate $(1-\Theta(1/\sqrt{\kappa}))^t$, where $\kappa > 1$ is the
condition number of a gram matrix and $t$ is the number of the iterations.
Compared to the convergence rate $(1-\Theta(1/{\kappa}))^t$ of GD, our result
provides theoretical guarantees for the acceleration of NAG in neural network
training. Furthermore, our findings suggest that NAG and HB have similar
convergence rate. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on six benchmark

system with a relay, where the updates are delivered to destination either from
the direct line or the two-hop link via the relay. An updating packet generated
at source is sent to receiver and the relay simultaneously. When the direct
packet transmission fails, the relay replaces the source and retransmits the
packet until it is eventually obtained at the receiver side. Assume that the
propagation delay on each link is one time slot, we determine the stationary
distribution of the AoI for three cases: (a) relay has no buffer and the packet
delivery from relay cannot be preempted by fresher updates from source; (b)
relay has no buffer but the packet substitution is allowable; (c) relay has
size 1 buffer and the packet in buffer is refreshed when a newer packet is
obtained. The idea is invoking a multiple-dimensional state vector which
contains the AoI as a part and constituting the multiple-dimensional AoI
stochastic process. We find the steady state of each multiple-dimensional AoI
process by solving the system of stationary equations. Once the steady-state
distribution of larger-dimensional AoI process is known, the stationary AoI
distribution is also obtained as it is one of the marginal distributions of
that process's steady-state distribution. For all the situations, we derive the
explicit expression of AoI distribution, and calculate the mean and the
variance of the stationary AoI. All the results are compared numerically,
including the AoI performance of the non-relay state updating system. Numerical
results show that adding the relay improves the system's timeliness
dramatically, and no-buffer-and-preemption setting in relay achieves both
minimal average AoI and AoI's variance. Thus, for the system model discussed in

relay.

facilitate our daily life and public services. As one of the key issues of
realizing these applications autonomously, path planning problem has been
studied with main objectives on minimizing travel distance, flight time and
energy cost. However, AAM operations in metropolitan areas bring safety and
society issues. Because most of AAM aircraft are unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) and they may fail to operate resulting in fatality risk, property damage
risk and societal impacts (noise and privacy) to the public. To quantitatively
assess these risks and mitigate them in planning phase, this paper proposes an
integrated risk assessment model and develops a hybrid algorithm to solve the
risk-based 3D path planning problem. The integrated risk assessment method
considers probability and severity models of UAV impact ground people and
vehicle. By introducing gravity model, the population density and traffic
density are estimated in a finer scale, which enables more accurate risk
assessment. The 3D risk-based path planning problem is first formulated as a
special minimum cost flow problem. Then, a hybrid estimation of distribution
algorithm (EDA) and risk-based A* (named as EDA-RA*) algorithm is proposed to
solve the problem. To improve computational efficiency, k-means clustering
method is incorporated into EDA-RA* to provide both global and local search
heuristic information, which formed the EDA and fast risk-based A* algorithm we
call EDA-FRA*. Case study results show that the risk assessment model can
capture high risk areas and the generated risk map enables safe UAV path

several works in sequential learning, many of which consider models for which
the value of the buyer or the opponents' maximal bid is chosen in an
adversarial manner. Even in the simplest settings, this gives rise to
algorithms whose regret grows as $\sqrt{T}$ with respect to the time horizon
$T$. Focusing on the case where the buyer plays against a stationary stochastic
environment, we show how to achieve significantly lower regret: when the
opponents' maximal bid distribution is known we provide an algorithm whose
regret can be as low as $\log^2(T)$; in the case where the distribution must be
learnt sequentially, a generalization of this algorithm can achieve $T^{1/3+
\epsilon}$ regret, for any $\epsilon>0$. To obtain these results, we introduce
two novel ideas that can be of interest in their own right. First, by
transposing results obtained in the posted price setting, we provide conditions
under which the first-price biding utility is locally quadratic around its
optimum. Second, we leverage the observation that, on small sub-intervals, the
concentration of the variations of the empirical distribution function may be
controlled more accurately than by using the classical
Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality. Numerical simulations confirm that our
algorithms converge much faster than alternatives proposed in the literature
for various bid distributions, including for bids collected on an actual

advantage of providing continuously infinitely many grasps, which is not the
case when using other grasp representations such as predefined grasp points.
For instance, this property can be leveraged in motion optimization to define
goal sets as implicit surface constraints in the robot configuration space. In
this work, we restrict ourselves to the case of estimating possible
end-effector positions directly from 2D camera images. To this extend, we
define grasp manifolds via a set of key points and locate them in images using
a Mask R-CNN backbone. Using learned features allows generalizing to different
view angles, with potentially noisy images, and objects that were not part of
the training set. We rely on simulation data only and perform experiments on
simple and complex objects, including unseen ones. Our framework achieves an
inference speed of 11.5 fps on a GPU, an average precision for keypoint
estimation of 94.5% and a mean pixel distance of only 1.29. This shows that we
can estimate the objects very well via bounding boxes and segmentation masks as
well as approximate the correct grasp manifold's keypoint coordinates.

environments and thus have the potential to be deployed in a wide variety of
scenarios. However, they are susceptible to falling and leg malfunction during
locomotion. Although the use of a large number of legs can overcome these
problems, it makes the body long and leads to many legs being constrained to
contact with the ground to support the long body, which impedes
maneuverability. To improve the locomotion maneuverability of such robots, the
present study focuses on dynamic instability, which induces rapid and large
movement changes, and uses a 12-legged robot with a flexible body axis. Our
previous work found that the straight walk of the robot becomes unstable
through Hopf bifurcation when the body axis flexibility is changed, which
induces body undulations. Furthermore, we developed a simple controller based
on the Hopf bifurcation and showed that the instability facilitates the turning
of the robot. In this study, we newly found that the straight walk becomes
unstable through pitchfork bifurcation when the body-axis flexibility is
changed in a way different from that in our previous work. In addition, the
pitchfork bifurcation induces a transition into a curved walk, whose curvature
can be controlled by the body-axis flexibility. We developed a simple
controller based on the pitchfork-bifurcation characteristics and demonstrated
that the robot can perform a turning maneuver superior to that with the
previous controller. This study provides a novel design principle for
maneuverable locomotion of many-legged robots using intrinsic dynamic

the very early universe where the standard model of particle physics and
cosmology are connected closely. As a possible component of SGWB, gravitational
waves (GW) from bubble collisions during the first order cosmological phase
transitions deserve comprehensive analyses. In 2017, Ryusuke Jinno and Masahiro
Takimoto proposed an elegant analysis approach to derive the analytical
expressions of energy spectra of GW from bubble collisions in Minkowski
spacetime avoiding large-scale numerical simulations for the first time[26].
However, they neglect the expansion of the universe and regard the duration of
phase transitions as infinity in their derivation which could deviate their
estimations from true values. For these two reasons, we give a new expression
of GW spectra by adopting their method, switching spacetime background to FLRW
spacetime, and considering a finite duration of phase transitions. By denoting
$\sigma$ as the fraction of the speed of phase transitions to the expansion
speed of the universe, we find when $\sigma$ is around $\mathcal{O}(10)$, the
maxima of estimated GW energy spectra drop by around 1 order of magnitude than
the results given by their previous work. Even when $\sigma=100$, the maximum
of GW energy spectrum is only $65\%$ of their previous estimation. Such a
significant decrease may bring about new challenges for the detectability of GW
from bubble collisions. Luckily, by comparing new spectra with PLI

not yet been well-explored, Compton telescope missions with a variety of
detector concepts have been proposed so far. One of the key techniques for
these future missions is an event reconstruction algorithm that is able to
determine the scattering orders of multiple Compton scattering events and to
identify events in which gamma rays escape from the detectors before they
deposit all of their energies. We revisit previous event reconstruction methods
and propose a modified algorithm based on a probabilistic method. First, we
present a general formalism of the probabilistic model of Compton scattering
describing physical interactions inside the detector and measurement processes.
Then, we also introduce several approximations in the calculation of the
probability functions for efficient computation. For validation, the developed
algorithm has been applied to simulation data of a Compton telescope using a
liquid argon time projection chamber, which is a new type of Compton telescope
proposed for the GRAMS project. We have confirmed that it works successfully
for up to 8-hit events, including correction of incoming gamma-ray energies for
escape events. The proposed algorithm can be used for next-generation MeV
gamma-ray missions featured by large-volume detectors, e.g., GRAMS.

central topic of research, with huge practical impacts. Among the numerous ways
to address privacy-preserving learning, we here take the perspective of
computing the divergences between distributions under the Differential Privacy
(DP) framework -- being able to compute divergences between distributions is
pivotal for many machine learning problems, such as learning generative models
or domain adaptation problems. Instead of resorting to the popular
gradient-based sanitization method for DP, we tackle the problem at its roots
by focusing on the Sliced Wasserstein Distance and seamlessly making it
differentially private. Our main contribution is as follows: we analyze the
property of adding a Gaussian perturbation to the intrinsic randomized
mechanism of the Sliced Wasserstein Distance, and we establish the
sensitivityof the resulting differentially private mechanism. One of our
important findings is that this DP mechanism transforms the Sliced Wasserstein
distance into another distance, that we call the Smoothed Sliced Wasserstein
Distance. This new differentially private distribution distance can be plugged
into generative models and domain adaptation algorithms in a transparent way,
and we empirically show that it yields highly competitive performance compared
with gradient-based DP approaches from the literature, with almost no loss in
accuracy for the domain adaptation problems that we consider.

for each fault type. On the contrary, real-world data is often unlabeled and
consists of mostly healthy observations and only few samples of faulty
conditions. The lack of labels and fault samples imposes a significant
challenge for existing data-driven fault diagnosis methods. In this paper, we
aim to overcome this limitation by integrating expert knowledge with domain
adaptation in a synthetic-to-real framework for unsupervised fault diagnosis.
Motivated by the fact that domain experts often have a relatively good
understanding on how different fault types affect healthy signals, in the first
step of the proposed framework, a synthetic fault dataset is generated by
augmenting real vibration samples of healthy bearings. This synthetic dataset
integrates expert knowledge and encodes class information about the fault
types. However, models trained solely based on the synthetic data often do not
perform well because of the distinct distribution difference between the
synthetically generated and real faults. To overcome this domain gap between
the synthetic and real data, in the second step of the proposed framework, an
imbalance-robust domain adaptation~(DA) approach is proposed to adapt the model
from synthetic faults~(source) to the unlabeled real faults~(target) which
suffer from severe class imbalance. The framework is evaluated on two
unsupervised fault diagnosis cases for bearings, the CWRU laboratory dataset
and a real-world wind-turbine dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
the generated faults are effective for encoding fault type information and the
domain adaptation is robust against the different levels of class imbalance
between faults.

demonstrate experimentally that our proposed active learning strategies require
fewer interventions compared to several baselines.

We combine small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) with optical

emulsions exhibiting drop self-shaping, the scattering spectra reveal the
formation of intermediate, metastable rotator phases in the alkane drops before

form in hexadecane drops, stabilized by C16EO10 surfactant. This rotator phase
melts at ca. 16.6 {\deg}C which is significantly lower than the melting

filtering methodology to solve nonlinear and high dimensional filtering and
inverse problems, little is known about their mathematical foundations. As
genetic-type particle filters (a.k.a. sequential Monte Carlo), this
ensemble-type methodology can also be interpreted as mean-field particle
approximations of the Kalman-Bucy filtering equation. In contrast with
conventional mean-field type interacting particle methods equipped with a
globally Lipschitz interacting drift-type function, Ensemble Kalman filters
depend on a nonlinear and quadratic-type interaction function defined in terms
of the sample covariance of the particles. Most of the literature in applied
mathematics and computer science on these sophisticated interacting particle
methods amounts to designing different classes of useable observer-type
particle methods. These methods are based on a variety of inconsistent but
judicious ensemble auxiliary transformations or include additional
inflation/localisationtype algorithmic innovations, in order to avoid the
inherent time-degeneracy of an insufficient particle ensemble size when solving
a filtering problem with an unstable signal. To the best of our knowledge, the
first and the only rigorous mathematical analysis of these sophisticated
discrete generation particle filters is developed in the pioneering articles by
Le Gland-Monbet-Tran and by Mandel-Cobb-Beezley, which were published in the
early 2010s. Nevertheless, besides the fact that these studies prove the
asymptotic consistency of the Ensemble Kalman filter, they provide exceedingly
pessimistic meanerror estimates that grow exponentially fast with respect to
the time horizon, even for linear Gaussian filtering problems with stable one
dimensional signals. In the present article we develop a novel self-contained
and complete stochastic perturbation analysis of the fluctuations, the
stability, and the long-time performance of these discrete generation ensemble
Kalman particle filters, including time-uniform and non-asymptotic mean-error
estimates that apply to possibly unstable signals. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first results of this type in the literature on
discrete generation particle filters, including the class of genetic-type
particle filters and discrete generation ensemble Kalman filters. The
stochastic Riccati difference equations considered in this work are also of
interest in their own right, as a prototype of a new class of stochastic
rational difference equation.

  Diagnostic Classification Model with Parallel Computing",,,,,"stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a statistical tool to assist formative assessments in educational
settings, diagnostic classification models (DCMs) have been increasingly used
to provide diagnostic information regarding examinees' attributes. DCMs often
adopt a dichotomous division such as the mastery and non-mastery of attributes
to express the mastery states of attributes. However, many practical settings
involve different levels of mastery states rather than a simple dichotomy in a
single attribute. Although this practical demand can be addressed by
polytomous-attribute DCMs, their computational cost in a Markov chain Monte
Carlo estimation impedes their large-scale application due to the larger number
of polytomous-attribute mastery patterns than that of binary-attribute ones.
This study considers a scalable Bayesian estimation method for
polytomous-attribute DCMs and developed a variational Bayesian (VB) algorithm
for a polytomous-attribute saturated DCM -- a generalization of
polytomous-attribute DCMs -- by building on the existing literature on
polytomous-attribute DCMs and VB for binary-attribute DCMs. Furthermore, we
proposed the configuration of parallel computing for the proposed VB algorithm
to achieve better computational efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations revealed
that our method exhibited the high performance in parameter recovery under a
wide range of conditions. An empirical example is used to demonstrate the
utility of our method.

phase transitions in an extended phase space, and find that the critical

Especially in many real-world application scenarios-like the ones covered in
this work-true labels are scarce, and their acquisition is expensive.
Therefore, we introduce a new algorithm for drift detection, Uncertainty Drift
Detection (UDD), which is able to detect drifts without access to true labels.
Our approach is based on the uncertainty estimates provided by a deep neural
network in combination with Monte Carlo Dropout. Structural changes over time
are detected by applying the ADWIN technique on the uncertainty estimates, and
detected drifts trigger a retraining of the prediction model. In contrast to
input data-based drift detection, our approach considers the effects of the
current input data on the properties of the prediction model rather than
detecting change on the input data only (which can lead to unnecessary
retrainings). We show that UDD outperforms other state-of-the-art strategies on
two synthetic as well as ten real-world data sets for both regression and

non-reliability to dataset shifts. To resolve this problem, most existing
studies attempted to transfer stable information to unseen environments.
Particularly, independent causal mechanisms-based methods proposed to remove
mutable causal mechanisms via the do-operator. Compared to previous methods,
the obtained stable predictors are more effective in identifying stable
information. However, a key question remains: which subset of this whole stable
information should the model transfer, in order to achieve optimal
generalization ability? To answer this question, we present a comprehensive
minimax analysis from a causal perspective. Specifically, we first provide a
graphical condition for the whole stable set to be optimal. When this condition
fails, we surprisingly find with an example that this whole stable set,
although can fully exploit stable information, is not the optimal one to
transfer. To identify the optimal subset under this case, we propose to
estimate the worst-case risk with a novel optimization scheme over the
intervention functions on mutable causal mechanisms. We then propose an
efficient algorithm to search for the subset with minimal worst-case risk,
based on a newly defined equivalence relation between stable subsets. Compared
to the exponential cost of exhaustively searching over all subsets, our
searching strategy enjoys a polynomial complexity. The effectiveness and
efficiency of our methods are demonstrated on synthetic data and the diagnosis

change, when translated into nuclear EFT with ""effective"" QCD degrees of

predicts an EoS that is soft below and stiff above $n\gsim n_{1/2}$, involving
no low-order phase transitions, and yields the macrophysical properties of
neutron stars consistent -- so far with no tension -- with the astrophysical
observations, including the maximum mass $ 2.0\lsim M/ M_\odot\lsim 2.2$ as
well as the GW data. Furthermore it describes the interior core of the massive
stars populated by baryon-charge-fractionalized quasi-fermions that are neither
baryonic nor quarkonic. It is argued that the cusp ""buried"" in the symmetry
energy resulting from strong correlations with hidden heavy degrees of freedom
leads, at $n\gsim n_{1/2}$, to what we dubbed ""pseudo-conformal"" sound speed,
$v^2_{pcs}/c^2\approx 1/3$, precociously converged from below at $n_{1/2}$. It
is not strictly conformal since the trace of energy-momentum tensor is not zero
even in the chiral limit. This observation with the topology change identified
with the putative hadron-quark continuity, taking place at at density $\gsim 2
n_0$, implies that the quantities accurately measured at $\sim n_0$ cannot give
a stringent constraint for what takes place at the core density of compact
stars $\sim (3-7) n_0$. This is because the change of degrees of freedom in

out that the usual benign cases of independently, identically distributed
(i.i.d.) observations or strongly convex losses are not sufficient. However,
combining i.i.d. observations with the assumption that outliers are those
observations that are in an extreme quantile of the distribution, does lead to
sublinear robust regret, even though the expected number of outliers is linear.

A previous study on over half a million issues from GitHub reports only about
42.2% of issues are manually linked by developers to their pertinent commits.
Automating the linking of commit-issue pairs can contribute to the improvement
of the said tasks. By far, current state-of-the-art approaches for automated
commit-issue linking suffer from low precision, leading to unreliable results,
sometimes to the point that imposes human supervision on the predicted links.
The low performance gets even more severe when there is a lack of textual
information in either commits or issues. Current approaches are also proven
computationally expensive.
  We propose Hybrid-Linker to overcome such limitations by exploiting two
information channels; (1) a non-textual-based component that operates on
non-textual, automatically recorded information of the commit-issue pairs to
predict a link, and (2) a textual-based one which does the same using textual
information of the commit-issue pairs. Then, combining the results from the two
classifiers, Hybrid-Linker makes the final prediction. Thus, every time one
component falls short in predicting a link, the other component fills the gap
and improves the results. We evaluate Hybrid-Linker against competing
approaches, namely FRLink and DeepLink on a dataset of 12 projects.
Hybrid-Linker achieves 90.1%, 87.8%, and 88.9% based on recall, precision, and

differential privacy (DP) is incorporated into FL clients to disturb original
parameters, which however can significantly impair the accuracy of the trained
model. In this work, we study a crucial question which has been vastly
overlooked by existing works: what are the optimal numbers of queries and
replies in FL with DP so that the final model accuracy is maximized. In FL, the
parameter server (PS) needs to query participating clients for multiple global
iterations to complete training. Each client responds a query from the PS by
conducting a local iteration. Our work investigates how many times the PS
should query clients and how many times each client should reply the PS. We
investigate two most extensively used DP mechanisms (i.e., the Laplace
mechanism and Gaussian mechanisms). Through conducting convergence rate
analysis, we can determine the optimal numbers of queries and replies in FL
with DP so that the final model accuracy can be maximized. Finally, extensive
experiments are conducted with publicly available datasets: MNIST and FEMNIST,
to verify our analysis and the results demonstrate that properly setting the

  The stellar dynamic models considered here are triples (f,rho,U) of three
functions: the distribution function f=f(r,u), the local density rho=rho(r) and
the Newtonian potential U=U(r), where r:=|x|, u:=|v| ((x,v) in R^3xR^3 are the
space-velocity coordinates), and f is a function q of the local energy
E=U(r)+u^2/2. Our first result is an answer to the following question: Given a
(positive) function p=p(r) on a bounded interval [0,R], how can one recognize p
as the local density of a stellar dynamic model of the given type (""inverse
problem"")? If this is the case, we say that p is ""extendable"" (to a complete
stellar dynamic model). Assuming that p is strictly decreasing, we reveal the
connection between p and F, which appears in the nonlinear integral equation
p=FU[p] and the solvability of Eddington's equation between F and q. Second, we
investigate the following question (""direct problem""): Which q induce
distribution functions f of the form f=q(-E(r,u)-E0) of a stellar dynamic
model? This leads to the investigation of the nonlinear equation p=FU[p] in an
approximate and constructive way by mainly numerical methods.
  The paper extends preceding work on flat galaxies to the three-dimensional
case. In particular, the present answer to the extendability problem is
completely different as in [1]. The present paper also opens the way to further
explicit solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system beyond the classical known

dynamical evolution to initial conditions. The skin effect discovered recently
in non-hermitian systems reveals the sensitivity to the spatial boundary
condition even deeply in bulk. In this letter, we show that these two seemingly
different phenomena can be unified through space-time duality. The intuition is
that the space-time duality maps unitary dynamics to non-unitary dynamics and
exchanges the temporal direction and spatial direction. Therefore, the
space-time duality can establish the connection between the sensitivity to the
initial condition in the temporal direction and the sensitivity to the boundary
condition in the spatial direction. Here we demonstrate this connection by
studying the space-time duality of the out-of-time-ordered commutator in a
concrete chaotic hermitian model. We show that the out-of-time-ordered
commutator is mapped to a special two-point correlator in a non-hermitian
system in the dual picture. For comparison, we show that this sensitivity
disappears when the non-hermiticity is removed in the dual picture.

accurately, by applying interferometry pulse sequences to a trapped ion optical
qubit. The interferometry sequences are sensitive to the change of ion
equilibrium position when the trap stiffness is changed, and we use this to
determine the stray electric field. The simplest pulse sequence is a two-pulse
Ramsey sequence, and longer sequences with multiple pulses offer a higher
precision. The methods allow the stray field strength to be minimized beyond
state-of-the-art levels, with only modest experimental requirements. Using a
sequence of nine pulses we reduce the 2D stray field strength to
$(10.5\pm0.8)\,\mathrm{mV\,m^{-1}}$ in $11\,\mathrm{s}$ measurement time. The
pulse sequences are easy to implement and automate, and they are robust against
laser detuning and pulse area errors.
  We use interferometry sequences with different lengths and precisions to
measure the stray field with an uncertainty below the standard quantum limit.
This marks a real-world case in which quantum metrology offers a significant
enhancement. Also, we minimize micromotion in 2D using a single probe laser, by
using an interferometry method together with the resolved sideband method; this
is useful for experiments with restricted optical access.
  Furthermore, a technique presented in this work is related to quantum
protocols for synchronising clocks; we demonstrate these protocols here.

potential in security-critical applications. Existing methods typically learn
body and motion features from the body-joint trajectory, whereas they lack a
systematic way to model body structure and underlying relations of body
components beyond the scale of body joints. In this paper, we for the first
time propose a Self-supervised Multi-scale Skeleton Graph Encoding (SM-SGE)
framework that comprehensively models human body, component relations, and
skeleton dynamics from unlabeled skeleton graphs of various scales to learn an
effective skeleton representation for person Re-ID. Specifically, we first
devise multi-scale skeleton graphs with coarse-to-fine human body partitions,
which enables us to model body structure and skeleton dynamics at multiple
levels. Second, to mine inherent correlations between body components in
skeletal motion, we propose a multi-scale graph relation network to learn
structural relations between adjacent body-component nodes and collaborative
relations among nodes of different scales, so as to capture more discriminative
skeleton graph features. Last, we propose a novel multi-scale skeleton
reconstruction mechanism to enable our framework to encode skeleton dynamics
and high-level semantics from unlabeled skeleton graphs, which encourages
learning a discriminative skeleton representation for person Re-ID. Extensive
experiments show that SM-SGE outperforms most state-of-the-art skeleton-based
methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness on 3D skeleton data estimated
from large-scale RGB videos. Our codes are open at

research interest and efforts towards predictive process monitoring, the
subfield of process mining (PM) that concerns predicting next events, process

variety of datasets and ways to split them into training and test sets. The
documentation of these preprocessing steps is not always complete.
Consequently, research results are hard or even impossible to reproduce and to
compare between papers. At times, the use of non-public domain knowledge
further hampers the fair competition of ideas. Often the training and test sets
are not completely separated, a data leakage problem particular to predictive
process monitoring. Moreover, test sets usually suffer from bias in terms of
both the mix of case durations and the number of running cases. These obstacles
pose a challenge to the field's progress. The contribution of this paper is to
identify and demonstrate the importance of these obstacles and to propose
preprocessing steps to arrive at unbiased benchmark datasets in a principled
way, thus creating representative test sets without data leakage with the aim
of levelling the playing field, promoting open science and contributing to more

dynamics and multi-criterion optimization involved. Recent works have
demonstrated the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for
simulation and physical robots. In these methods, the rewards from different
criteria are normally summed to learn a single value function. However, this
may cause the loss of dependency information between hybrid rewards and lead to
a sub-optimal policy. In this work, we propose a novel reward-adaptive
reinforcement learning for biped locomotion, allowing the control policy to be
simultaneously optimized by multiple criteria using a dynamic mechanism. The
proposed method applies a multi-head critic to learn a separate value function
for each reward component. This leads to hybrid policy gradient. We further
propose dynamic weight, allowing each component to optimize the policy with
different priorities. This hybrid and dynamic policy gradient (HDPG) design
makes the agent learn more efficiently. We show that the proposed method
outperforms summed-up-reward approaches and is able to transfer to physical
robots. The sim-to-real and MuJoCo results further demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalization of HDPG.

on inference in the context of data centric science and engineering

one endeavours in this context to learn complex systems in order to make more
informed predictions and high stakes decisions under uncertainty. Some key
challenges which must be met in this context are robustness, generalizability,
and interpretability. The Bayesian framework addresses these three challenges
elegantly, while bringing with it a fourth, undesirable feature: it is
typically far more expensive than its deterministic counterparts. In the 21st
century, and increasingly over the past decade, a growing number of methods
have emerged which allow one to leverage cheap low-fidelity models in order to
precondition algorithms for performing inference with more expensive models and
make Bayesian inference tractable in the context of high-dimensional and
expensive models. Notable examples are multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC),
multi-index Monte Carlo (MIMC), and their randomized counterparts (rMLMC),
which are able to provably achieve a dimension-independent (including
$\infty-$dimension) canonical complexity rate with respect to mean squared
error (MSE) of $1/$MSE. Some parallelizability is typically lost in an
inference context, but recently this has been largely recovered via novel
double randomization approaches. Such an approach delivers i.i.d. samples of
quantities of interest which are unbiased with respect to the infinite
resolution target distribution. Over the coming decade, this family of
algorithms has the potential to transform data centric science and engineering,
as well as classical machine learning applications such as deep learning, by
scaling up and scaling out fully Bayesian inference.

in closed form the probabilities that posts originating from a given user are

system of equations, which can be resolved iteratively. In fact, our model is
very flexible with respect to the modelling assumptions. Using the
probabilities derived from the solution, we define a new measure of per-user

position on the graph with user (re-)posting activity. In the homogeneous case
where all users have the same activity rates, it is shown that a variant of the
$\Psi$-score is equal to PageRank. Furthermore, we compare the new model and
its $\Psi$-score against the empirical influence measured from very large data

measurements that are spatially separated by specifically accounting for
typical features of such data. Namely, measurements in close proximity tend to
be more similar than the ones further separated. This might hold also true for
cross-dependencies when multivariate spatial data is considered. Often,
scientists are interested in linear transformations of such data which are easy
to interpret and might be used as dimension reduction. Recently, for that

that the observed data are formed by a linear mixture of uncorrelated, weakly
stationary random fields. However, in practical applications, it is well-known
that when the spatial domain increases in size the weak stationarity
assumptions can be violated in the sense that the second order dependency is
varying over the domain which leads to non-stationary analysis. In our work we

Unification of the two approaches is difficult due to lacking synergies.
Conclusions: Our study generates 12 main findings which provide insights into
the capabilities and synergy of these two approaches. Through these
observations we provide recommendations for use and improvement.

module of conversation transcription systems thanks to its ability to handle

introduces target speech distortion, resulting in a sub-optimum word error rate
(WER). In this paper, we describe our efforts to improve the performance of a
single channel speech separation system. Specifically, we investigate a
two-stage training scheme that firstly applies a feature level optimization
criterion for pretraining, followed by an ASR-oriented optimization criterion
using an end-to-end (E2E) speech recognition model. Meanwhile, to keep the
model light-weight, we introduce a modified teacher-student learning technique
for model compression. By combining those approaches, we achieve a absolute
average WER improvement of 2.70% and 0.77% using models with less than 10M

the momentum dependence of the form of wave functions imposed by Lorentz

of such observables is given by the hadron form factors, where it was shown
that the large Q behavior is mostly frozen, when the Lorentz contraction of the
hadron wave functions is taken into account. Another example considered
previously is the strong hadron decay with high energy emission. In this paper
we study the role of the Lorentz contraction in the high-energy hadron-hadron
scattering process at large momentum transfer. For the $pp$ and $p\bar p$

behavior and show how softness affects the ordering of anisotropic particles at
fluid oil-water interfaces. Three different core-shell systems were synthesized
such that they have the same elliptical hematite-silica core but differ with
respect to thickness and stiffness of the soft microgel shell. Compression
isotherms, the shape of individual core-shell microgel as well as their 2D
order at a decane-water interface are investigated by means of the

how softness, size and anisotropy of the microgel shell affect the side-to-side

alignment with respect to the direction of compression in the Langmuir trough.
A large and soft microgel shell leads to an ordered structure with a tip-to-tip
alignment directed perpendicular to the direction of compression. In contrast,
a thin and harder microgel shell leads to side-to-side ordering orientated
parallel to the compression direction. In addition, the thin and harder
microgel shell induces clustering of the microgels in the dilute state

with a distinctive consideration for rare events, in which divergence measures
are used to bound the event-wise ambiguity sets. This is done by using the
Poisson distribution with uncertain expected value parameter to model rare
events and showing that the distribution possesses theoretical properties that
enable the derivation of rare-event probability bounds. We employ the proven
bijection between the Bregman divergence and the Poisson distribution to
characterize variations within the probability bounds, and demonstrate that the
explicit use of the Poisson-specific Bregman divergence results in reduced
conservatism in decision-making. Moreover, we derive a probability bound on
this conservatism reduction, which is a concept akin to the popular probability
of constraint violation in robust optimization. The bound shows that the rarer
the event, the more the rare-event information becomes powerful. Finally, we
provide tractable reformulations for our robust counterparts under rare events.
Our computational study, based on a realistic case study involving 18 years of

the dynamical decoupling protocols that simultaneously extend coherence. We
illustrate this pulse-based adiabatic control for nuclear spins around NV

leverage the information within the boundary of the method being summarized

code summarization. This paper explores two global contexts, namely intra-class

Summarization with Multi-Relational Graph Neural Networks. CoCoSUM first
incorporates class names as the intra-class context to generate the class
semantic embeddings. Then, relevant Unified Modeling Language (UML) class
diagrams are extracted as inter-class context and are encoded into the class
relational embeddings using a novel Multi-Relational Graph Neural Network
(MRGNN). Class semantic embeddings and class relational embeddings, together
with the outputs from code token encoder and AST encoder, are passed to a
decoder armed with a two-level attention mechanism to generate high-quality,

predicting links in networks, such as Facebook friendship suggestions,

means of network embedding methods, owing to their state-of-the-art
performance. However, these methods lack transparency when compared to simpler
baselines, and as a result their robustness against adversarial attacks is a
possible point of concern: could one or a few small adversarial modifications
to the network have a large impact on the link prediction performance when
using a network embedding model? Prior research has already investigated
adversarial robustness for network embedding models, focused on classification
at the node and graph level. Robustness with respect to the link prediction
downstream task, on the other hand, has been explored much less.
  This paper contributes to filling this gap, by studying adversarial
robustness of Conditional Network Embedding (CNE), a state-of-the-art
probabilistic network embedding model, for link prediction. More specifically,
given CNE and a network, we measure the sensitivity of the link predictions of
the model to small adversarial perturbations of the network, namely changes of
the link status of a node pair. Thus, our approach allows one to identify the
links and non-links in the network that are most vulnerable to such
perturbations, for further investigation by an analyst. We analyze the
characteristics of the most and least sensitive perturbations, and empirically
confirm that our approach not only succeeds in identifying the most vulnerable
links and non-links, but also that it does so in a time-efficient manner thanks

observed on the solar surface. Consequently, we observe a smaller number of
highly energetic events such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
which are often associated with active regions on the photosphere. Nonetheless,
our magnetofrictional simulations during the minimum period suggest that the
solar corona is still dynamically evolving in response to the large-scale
shearing velocities on the solar surface. The non-potential evolution of the
corona leads to the accumulation of magnetic free energy and helicity, which is
periodically shed in eruptive events. We find that these events fall into two
distinct classes: One set of events are caused by eruption and ejection of
low-lying coronal flux ropes, and they could explain the origin of occasional
CMEs during solar minimum. The other set of events are not driven by
destabilisation of low-lying structures but rather by eruption of overlying
sheared arcades. These could be associated with streamer blowouts or stealth
CMEs. The two classes differ significantly in the amount of magnetic flux and
helicity shed through the outer coronal boundary. We additionally explore how
other measurables such as current, open magnetic flux, free energy, coronal
holes, and the horizontal component of the magnetic field on the outer model
boundary vary during the two classes of event. This study emphasises the
importance and necessity of understanding the dynamics of the coronal magnetic

important in many contexts, such as environmental planning and structural
engineering. In this paper, we propose new estimation methods for extremal
bivariate return curves, a risk measure that is the natural bivariate extension
to a return level. Unlike several existing techniques, our estimates are based
on bivariate extreme value models that can capture both key forms of extremal
dependence. We devise tools for validating return curve estimates, as well as
representing their uncertainty, and compare a selection of curve estimation
techniques through simulation studies. We apply the methodology to two metocean
data sets, with diagnostics indicating generally good performance.

continues to be challenging due to several limitations. Some of the main
shortcomings are the lack of interpretability and the lack of robustness
against adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper, we
explore the possibilities and limits of adversarial attacks for explainable
machine learning models. First, we extend the notion of adversarial examples to
fit in explainable machine learning scenarios, in which the inputs, the output
classifications and the explanations of the model's decisions are assessed by
humans. Next, we propose a comprehensive framework to study whether (and how)
adversarial examples can be generated for explainable models under human
assessment, introducing novel attack paradigms. In particular, our framework
considers a wide range of relevant (yet often ignored) factors such as the type
of problem, the user expertise or the objective of the explanations in order to
identify the attack strategies that should be adopted in each scenario to
successfully deceive the model (and the human). These contributions intend to
serve as a basis for a more rigorous and realistic study of adversarial
examples in the field of explainable machine learning.

the leading eigenvalues of the autocovariance matrix associated with a given
observable of a dynamical system. For any observable $f$ for which all the
time-delayed autocovariance exist, we construct a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_f$
and a Koopman-like operator $\mathcal{K}$ that acts on $\mathcal{H}_f$. We
prove that the leading eigenvalues of the autocovariance matrix has one-to-one
correspondence with the energy of $f$ that is represented by the eigenvectors
of $\mathcal{K}$. The proof is associated to several representation theorems of
isometric operators on a Hilbert space, and the weak-mixing property of the
observables represented by the continuous spectrum. We also provide an
alternative proof of the weakly mixing property. When $f$ is an observable of
an ergodic dynamical system which has a finite invariant measure $\mu$,
$\mathcal{H}_f$ coincides with closure in $L^2(X,d\mu)$ of Krylov subspace
generated by $f$, and $\mathcal{K}$ coincides with the classical Koopman
operator. The main theorem sheds light to the theoretical foundation of several
semi-empirical methods, including singular spectrum analysis (SSA),
data-adaptive harmonic analysis (DAHD), Hankel DMD and Hankel alternative view
of Koopman analysis (HAVOK). It shows that, when the system is ergodic and has
finite invariant measure, the leading temporal empirical orthogonal functions
indeed correspond to the Koopman eigenfrequencies. A theorem-based practical
methodology is then proposed to identify the eigenfrequencies of $\mathcal{K}$
from a given time series. It builds on the fact that the convergence of the
renormalized eigenvalues of the Gram matrix is a necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of $\mathcal{K}-$eigenfrequencies.

in graphs poses a significant challenge to conventional compression algorithms,
limiting their attainable gains as well as their ability to discover relevant
patterns. On the other hand, most graph compression approaches rely on
domain-dependent handcrafted representations and cannot adapt to different
underlying graph distributions. This work aims to establish the necessary
principles a lossless graph compression method should follow to approach the
entropy storage lower bound. Instead of making rigid assumptions about the
graph distribution, we formulate the compressor as a probabilistic model that
can be learned from data and generalise to unseen instances. Our ""Partition and
Code"" framework entails three steps: first, a partitioning algorithm decomposes
the graph into subgraphs, then these are mapped to the elements of a small
dictionary on which we learn a probability distribution, and finally, an
entropy encoder translates the representation into bits. All the components
(partitioning, dictionary and distribution) are parametric and can be trained
with gradient descent. We theoretically compare the compression quality of
several graph encodings and prove, under mild conditions, that PnC achieves
compression gains that grow either linearly or quadratically with the number of
vertices. Empirically, PnC yields significant compression improvements on
diverse real-world networks.

information, for example, the facial feature of a person and the plate number

are not explicitly represented. For example, a person's face may appear in two

data(e.g., the person's name and age). End-users prefer to query the semantic
information from unstructured data together with structured data based on the
potential relationships among them. However, due to the lack of a unified
database system for structured and unstructured data, developers have to
comprise multiple systems and runtime together to answer these queries. In this
work, we build an open-source graph database named PandaDB to consistently
manage and query structured and unstructured data. We first introduce a graph
data model to manage structured and unstructured data, then propose a new query
language to understand the semantics of the unstructured data in the graph.
Next, we develop a new cost model and related query optimization techniques to
speed up the unstructured data processing pipeline. Finally, we optimize the
unstructured data storage and provide the index to speed up the query
processing over unstructured data. PandaDB is widely used in industrial
applications like FinTech, Knowledge Graph, and Recommendation System. The

information theory. For nearly four decades, substantial QKD schemes are
developed. In early years, the security of QKD protocols is depend on switching
different bases, namely based on non-orthogonal state encoding. The most famous
example is the BB84 protocol. Later, other techniques were developed for
orthogonal state encoding. Examples of such protocols include the GV protocol
and order-rearrangement protocols. In this paper, we present two QKD protocols
based on orthogonal state encoding. One of them does not need to employ
order-rearrangement techniques while the other needs to. We provide analyses
for them, demonstrating that they are highly efficient when considering
consumptions of both qubits and classical bits. Furthermore, the employment of
maximally entangled states could be less than previous ones and so the
measurement efficiency could be increased. We also modify the protocols for
implementing in noisy channels by applying the testing state method.

integration are still not wholly achieved. As a result, fragmented applications
are developed against energy data silos, and data exchange is limited to few
applications. In this paper, we analyze the challenges and requirements related
to energy-related data applications. We also evaluate the use of Energy Data
Ecosystems (EDEs) as data-driven infrastructures to overcome the current
limitations of fragmented energy applications. EDEs are inspired by the
International Data Space (IDS) initiative launched in Germany at the end of
2014 with an overall objective to take both the development and use of the IDS
reference architecture model to a European/global level. The reference
architecture model consists of four architectures related to business,

applicability of EDEs and IDS reference architecture in real-world scenarios
from the energy sector. The analyzed scenario is positioned in the context of
the EU-funded H2020 project PLATOON.

research, with many public successes that have demonstrated its potential. As
such, these systems are now being incorporated into commercial products. With
this comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that solve
tasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple
solutions have been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in
particular: learning from human feedback. Rather than training AI systems using
a predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with a predefined set
of categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived
from some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the
understanding of the task changes, or as the capabilities of the AI system
improve.
  The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward research on this important
class of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which we
expect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions. These tasks
are defined by a paragraph of natural language: for example, ""create a
waterfall and take a scenic picture of it"", with additional clarifying details.
Participants must train a separate agent for each task, using any method they
want. Agents are then evaluated by humans who have read the task description.
To help participants get started, we provide a dataset of human demonstrations
on each of the four tasks, as well as an imitation learning baseline that
leverages these demonstrations.
  Our hope is that this competition will improve our ability to build AI
systems that do what their designers intend them to do, even when the intent
cannot be easily formalized. Besides allowing AI to solve more tasks, this can
also enable more effective regulation of AI systems, as well as making progress
on the value alignment problem.

scientific investigations and technical applications, such as, optical field
manipulation, pulse shaping, sample characteristics test, and biomedical
imaging. Tremendous progress in parameter measurement of ultrafast laser has
been made, including single-shot spectra acquired by time-stretch dispersive
Fourier transform in spectral domain, and pulse magnification or compression
realized by time lens in temporal domain. Nevertheless, single-shot measurement
of frequency-resolved states of polarization (SOPs) of ultrafast lasers has not
been reported so far, and the unregular SOP evolution dynamics in ultrafast
pulses is hardly explored. Here, we demonstrate a new single-shot
frequency-resolved SOPs measurement system by utilizing division-of-amplitude
method under far-field approximation. Large dispersion is utilized to
time-stretch the laser pulses, where the spectrum information is mapped into
temporal waveform via dispersive Fourier transform. By calibrating system
matrix with different wavelengths, the precise frequency-resolved SOPs are
obtained together with high speed opto-electron detection. We demonstrate
applications in direct measurement of transient mode-locked fiber laser
dynamics. We observe complex frequency-dependent SOPs dynamics in the building
up of dissipative solitons, and apparent discrepancy of SOPs between sideband
and main peak in conventional solitons. Our observations reveal that the SOP
plays a far more complex part in mode-locking process, which is different from
the traditional viewpoint. Taking advantage of broadband achromatic optical
elements, this method can be extended to measurement of much broad pulse
lasers, which will pave the way for reliable measurement and precise control of
ultrafast lasers with frequency-resolved SOPs structures.

lattice structure of 4H SiC four different V$_\text{C}$V$_\text{Si}$
configurations can be formed. Ground and optical excited states of
V$_\text{C}$V$_\text{Si}^0$ exhibit $S$=1 spintriplet state and the
corresponding transition energies are around $\approx 1.1$~eV falling in the
near-infrared wavelength region. Recently, photoluminescence (PL) quenching has
been experimentally observed for all V$_\text{C}$V$_\text{Si}$ configurations
in 4H SiC, i.e. the corresponding zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) appear only at
higher-than-ZPL photoexcitation energies (threshold energies). It has been
shown that V$_\text{C}$V$_\text{Si}^0$ is converted to
V$_\text{C}$V$_\text{Si}^-$ upon photoexcitation below the correspoding
excitation threshold energies at cryogenic temperature, i.e.
V$_\text{C}$V$_\text{Si}^-$ is the so-called dark state. In this study we
demonstrate that the threshold energy for reinozation is temperature dependent.
We further carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations in order to
investigate the temperature dependent reionization spectrum, i.e. the spectrum
of the V$_\text{C}$V$_\text{Si}^- \rightarrow$ V$_\text{C}$V$_\text{Si}^0$

carried out at around room temperature ($\approx$300~K) by using the usually

modulated at room temperature by a modest electric field. A field directed
antiparallel (parallel) to the spin-diffusion velocity can in fact largely
increase (decrease) the spin-transport length compared with the zero field

path in germanium results in about one order of magnitude modulation of the
spin-polarized electrons entering in the detector. The present work
demonstrates that electric fields can be exploited for guiding spins over
macroscopic distances and for realizing fast, room temperature modulation of

conditions and inhomogeneous mobility of the form $m(h) =

slip length, $y > 0$ denotes the lateral variable, and $n \in (0,3)$ is the
mobility exponent parameterizing the nonlinear slip condition. The
partial-wetting regime implies the boundary condition $\partial_y h =

microscopic contact angle). Existence and uniqueness of traveling-wave
solutions to this problem under the constraint $\partial_y^2 h \to 0$ as $h \to
\infty$ have been proved in previous work by Chiricotto and Giacomelli in
[Commun. Appl. Ind. Math., 2(2):e-388, 16, 2011]. We are interested in the
asymptotics as $h \downarrow 0$ and $h \to \infty$. By reformulating the
problem as $h \downarrow 0$ as a dynamical system for the difference between
the solution and the microscopic contact angle, values for $n$ are found for
which linear as well as nonlinear resonances occur. These resonances lead to a
different asymptotic behavior of the solution as $h\downarrow0$ depending on
$n$.
  Together with the asymptotics as $h\to\infty$ characterizing the Cox-Voinov
law for the velocity-dependent macroscopic contact angle as found by
Giacomelli, the first author of this work, and Otto in [Nonlinearity,
29(9):2497-2536, 2016], the rigorous asymptotics of traveling-wave solutions to
the thin-film equation in partial wetting can be characterized. Furthermore,
our approach enables us to analyze the relation between the microscopic and
macroscopic contact angle. It is found that the Cox-Voinov law for the
macroscopic contact angle depends continuously differentiably on the
microscopic contact angle.

synthetic WL images and associated ground-truth masks using an optical
ray-tracing engine to fake mega-voltage EPID images. The model called DeepWL
was trained on 1500 synthetic WL images using data augmentation techniques for
180 epochs. The model was built using Keras with a TensorFlow backend on an
Intel Core i5 6500T CPU and trained in approximately 15 hours. DeepWL was shown
to produce ball bearing and multi-leaf collimator field segmentations with a
mean dice coefficient of 0.964 and 0.994 respectively on previously unseen
synthetic testing data. When DeepWL was applied to WL data measured on an EPID,
the predicted mean displacements were shown to be statistically similar to the
Canny Edge detection method. However, the DeepWL predictions for the ball
bearing locations were shown to correlate better with manual annotations
compared with the Canny edge detection algorithm. DeepWL was demonstrated to
analyse Winston-Lutz images with accuracy suitable for routine linac quality
assurance with some statistical evidence that it may outperform Canny Edge
detection methods in terms of segmentation robustness and the resultant
displacement predictions.

imputations) of the missing entries in a dataset to facilitate downstream
analysis, most depend on assumptions that may not align with real-world
applications and could suffer from poor performance in subsequent tasks such as
classification. This is particularly true if the data have large missingness
rates or a small sample size. More importantly, the imputation error could be
propagated into the prediction step that follows, which may constrain the
capabilities of the prediction model. In this work, we introduce the gradient
importance learning (GIL) method to train multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and
long short-term memories (LSTMs) to directly perform inference from inputs
containing missing values without imputation. Specifically, we employ
reinforcement learning (RL) to adjust the gradients used to train these models
via back-propagation. This allows the model to exploit the underlying
information behind missingness patterns. We test the approach on real-world
time-series (i.e., MIMIC-III), tabular data obtained from an eye clinic, and a
standard dataset (i.e., MNIST), where our imputation-free predictions
outperform the traditional two-step imputation-based predictions using
state-of-the-art imputation methods.

of this article is to show the existence of hidden geometric aspects of the
fourth Frobenius manifold, which turns out to be related to so-called causality
conditions. Firstly, it is proved that the fourth class of Frobenius manifolds
is a Pseudo-Elliptic one. Secondly, this manifold turns out to be a
sub-manifold of a non-orientable Lorentzian projective manifold. Thirdly,
Maurer--Cartan structures for this manifold and hidden geometrical properties

velocity profiles of the Class 0 protostellar object B335 and attempts to put

transitions are presented and the spectral profiles are analyzed at envelope
radii between 100 and 860 au. C$^{17}$O emission presents a double peaked line
profile distributed in a complex velocity field. Both peaks present an offset
of 0.2 to 1 km s$^{-1}$ from the systemic velocity of the source in the probed
area. The optical depth of the C$^{17}$O emission has been estimated and found
to be less than 1, suggesting that the two velocity peaks trace two distinct
velocity components of the gas in the inner envelope. After discarding possible
motions that could produce the complex velocity pattern, such as rotation and
outflow, it is concluded that infall is producing the velocity field. Because
inside-out symmetric collapse cannot explain those observed profiles, it is
suggested that those are produced by non-isotropic accretion from the envelope
into the central source along the outflow cavity walls.

apply precise machine learning and specifically deep learning methods to
Persian and other low resource languages, rule-based approaches that can
function similarly to these systems will be of a great interest. Also recently,
emergence of new methods such as transfer learning, has opened up the
possibility of deep learning for low-resource languages. Considering two above
points, in this study, along with a simple rule-base baseline, a novel
rule-base system for identifying semantic contradiction along with a Bert base
deep contradiction detection system for Persian texts have been introduced. The
rule base system has used frequent rule mining method to extract appropriate
contradiction rules using a development set. Extracted rules are tested for
different categories of contradictory sentences. In this system the maximum
f-measure among contradiction categories is obtained for negation about 90% and
the average F-measure of system for all classes is about 76% which outperforms
other algorithms on Persian texts. On the other hand, because of medium

the grid frequency and voltage dynamics, but they can effectively participate
to existing primary and secondary control loops together with the classic
thermal/inertia synchronous generators and fulfill the same specifications both
from the control and contractual points of view. To achieve such level of
performances, a system approach based on an innovatory control model is
proposed. The latter control model drops classic hypothesis for separation of
voltage and frequency dynamics used till now in order to gather these dynamics
into a small size model. From the system point of view, dynamics are grouped by
time-scales of phenomena in the proposed control model. This results in more
performant controls in comparison to classic approaches which orient controls
to physical actuators (control of grid side converter and of generator side
converter). Also, this allows coordination between control of converters and
generator or, in case of multimachines specifications, among several PPMs. From
the control synthesis point of view, classic robust approaches are used (like,
e.g., H-infinity synthesis). Implementation and validation tests are presented
for wind PPMs but the approach holds for any other type of PPM. These results
will be further used to control the units of the new concept of Dynamic Virtual

given the criticality of ownership traceability and resource exchanging in a
sharing ecosystem. To address that, we propose integrating blockchain
technology for enabling mobile operators and other players to exchange RAN
resources (e.g., infrastructure) in the form of virtual network functions (VNF)
autonomously and dynamically. Blockchain will provide automation, robustness,
trustworthiness, and reliability to mobile networks, thus bringing confidence
to open RAN environments. In particular, we define a novel O-RAN-based
blockchain-enabled architecture that allows automating RAN sharing procedures
through either auction or marketplace-based mechanisms. The potential
advantages of the proposed solution are demonstrated through simulation
results. The used simulation platform is openly released.

output (e.g., a classification decision) is not clearly and intuitively
connected to their input (e.g., an image). To cope with this issue, several
explainable ML techniques have been proposed to, e.g., identify which pixels of
an input image had the strongest influence on its classification. However, in
distributed scenarios, it is often more important to connect decisions with the
information used for the model training and the nodes supplying such
information. To this end, in this paper we focus on federated learning and
present a new methodology, named node liability in federated learning (NL-FL),
which permits to identify the source of the training information that most
contributed to a given decision. After discussing NL-FL's cost in terms of
extra computation, storage, and network latency, we demonstrate its usefulness
in an edge-based scenario. We find that NL-FL is able to swiftly identify
misbehaving nodes and to exclude them from the training process, thereby
improving learning accuracy.

solution thermodynamics. The Modified Quasichemical Model in the Pair
Approximation (MQMPA) can effectively capture the thermodynamic features of a
binary solution with a onefold SRO. However, once the SRO occurs at multiple
compositions in a binary solution, the MQMPA is in principle inconvenient to
treat the solution thermodynamics. It usually requires a large number of model
parameters to fit the thermodynamic data of such a solution. The present work
proposes the Modified Quasichemical Model in the Distinguishable-Pair
Approximation (MQMDPA), which is a further improvement of the MQMPA. The MQMDPA
can more realistically describe the solution thermodynamics with manifold SROs
using fewer model parameters. It benefits from grouping the ordered pairs,
which were assumed to be indistinguishable within the MQMPA, into several
distinguishable types. Each kind of ordered pair has unique coordination
numbers and pair energy, which is responsible for describing one of the SROs at
the desired composition and strength. Interestingly, the MQMDPA can be
completely transformed into the MQMPA when all kinds of ordered pairs are
assigned the same pair energy and coordination numbers. The distinguishable
pairs have thus become indistinguishable. Several real liquids with at least
two observed SROs were successfully treated by the MQMDPA to demonstrate its
effectiveness and reliability.

The analysis is based on the thin-sheet equations, which were recently shown to

the multi-node convex optimization problem, in which every node performs
iterative computations and exchanges information with its neighbors. At every
iteration of D-ADMM-FTERC, each node solves a local convex optimization problem
for the one of the primal variables and utilizes a finite-time exact consensus
protocol to obtain the optimal value of the other variable, since the cost
function for the second primal variable is not decomposable. Since D-ADMM-FTERC
requires to know the upper bound on the number of nodes in the network, we

emphasize the benefits of time-of-flight measurements for particle
identification of long-lived charged hadrons.
  That method relies on a precise estimation of the time-of-flight as expected,
for a given mass hypothesis, from the reconstructed particle momentum and its
trajectory. We show that for a realistic detector set-up, relativistic formulae
are a good approximation down to lowest possible momenta.
  The optimally fitted track parameters are commonly defined near the
interaction region. Extrapolation to a time-of-flight counter located behind
the central tracking device can usually only be performed by a track model
undisturbed from material effects. However, the true trajectory is distorted by
multiple Coulomb scattering and the momentum is changed by energy loss. As a
consequence, the estimated time-of-flight is biased by a large systematic
error.
  This study presents a novel approach of time-of-flight estimation by
splitting the trajectory into a chain of undisturbed track elements, following
as close as possible the true trajectory. Each track element possesses an
individual momentum $p_i$ and flight distance $l_i$. Remarkably, our formulae
emerge by formally replacing the global momentum squared $p^2$ by the weighted
harmonic mean of the individual $\{ p_i^2 \}$, with the weights being the
corresponding individual $\{ l_i \}$.
  The optimally fitted parameters of the individual track elements can be
obtained from track reconstruction by a Kalman filter plus smoother. However,
care must be taken when including mass-dependent material effects.
  Explicit formulae for a simple scenario (homogeneous magnetic field and
cylindrical surfaces) are given, together with an overview about the treatment
of multiple Coulomb scattering and energy loss by a Kalman filter.

laser switching experiments. We anticipate that this approach to simulating the
switching response of PCMs will become an important component for designing and
simulating programmable photonics devices. The method is particularly important
for predicting the multi-level optical response of PCMs, which is important for
all-optical neural networks and PCM-programmable perceptrons.

graphics applications, 3D model quality assessment (3D-QA) has become an
important task in the multimedia area. Point cloud and mesh are the two most
widely used digital representation formats of 3D models, the visual quality of
which is quite sensitive to lossy operations like simplification and
compression. Therefore, many related studies such as point cloud quality
assessment (PCQA) and mesh quality assessment (MQA) have been carried out to
measure the visual quality degradations of 3D models. However, a large part of
previous studies utilize full-reference (FR) metrics, which indicates they can
not predict the quality level with the absence of the reference 3D model.
Furthermore, few 3D-QA metrics consider color information, which significantly
restricts their effectiveness and scope of application. In this paper, we
propose a no-reference (NR) quality assessment metric for colored 3D models
represented by both point cloud and mesh. First, we project the 3D models from
3D space into quality-related geometry and color feature domains. Then, the 3D
natural scene statistics (3D-NSS) and entropy are utilized to extract
quality-aware features. Finally, machine learning is employed to regress the
quality-aware features into visual quality scores. Our method is validated on
the colored point cloud quality assessment database (SJTU-PCQA), the Waterloo
point cloud assessment database (WPC), and the colored mesh quality assessment
database (CMDM). The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms most compared NR 3D-QA metrics with competitive computational

studied to track the pressure gradient at a downstream location of a channel.
This requires manipulation of gas pressure at the downstream location and the
use of pressure measurements at an upstream location. To achiever this, the
backstepping approach is adapted to the space FPDEs. The key challenge in this
adaptation is the non-applicability of the Lyapunov theory which is typically
used to prove the stability of the target system as, the obtained target system
is fractional in space. In addition, a backstepping adaptive observer is
designed to jointly estimate both the system's state and the disturbance. The

Internet. Thus, detecting deepfakes has attracted increasing attentions from
both academia and industry. State-of-the-art deepfake detection methods consist
of two key components, i.e., face extractor and face classifier, which extract
the face region in an image and classify it to be real/fake, respectively.
Existing studies mainly focused on improving the detection performance in
non-adversarial settings, leaving security of deepfake detection in adversarial
settings largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap. In
particular, we perform a systematic measurement study to understand the
security of the state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods in adversarial
settings. We use two large-scale public deepfakes data sources including
FaceForensics++ and Facebook Deepfake Detection Challenge, where the deepfakes
are fake face images; and we train state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods.
These detection methods can achieve 0.94--0.99 accuracies in non-adversarial
settings on these datasets. However, our measurement results uncover multiple
security limitations of the deepfake detection methods in adversarial settings.
First, we find that an attacker can evade a face extractor, i.e., the face
extractor fails to extract the correct face regions, via adding small Gaussian
noise to its deepfake images. Second, we find that a face classifier trained
using deepfakes generated by one method cannot detect deepfakes generated by
another method, i.e., an attacker can evade detection via generating deepfakes
using a new method. Third, we find that an attacker can leverage backdoor
attacks developed by the adversarial machine learning community to evade a face
classifier. Our results highlight that deepfake detection should consider the
adversarial nature of the problem.

extended halo emission, where the high density of soft photons in the
surroundings of stars create a suitable environment for $\gamma$-ray production
via inverse Compton (IC) scattering by cosmic-ray electrons. Besides the Sun,
no other disk or halo from single stars has ever been detected in

performance under domain shift. One way to improve domain generalization is to
collect diverse source data from multiple relevant domains so that a CNN model
is allowed to learn more domain-invariant, and hence generalizable
representations. In this work, we address domain generalization with MixStyle,
a plug-and-play, parameter-free module that is simply inserted to shallow CNN
layers and requires no modification to training objectives. Specifically,
MixStyle probabilistically mixes feature statistics between instances. This
idea is inspired by the observation that visual domains can often be
characterized by image styles which are in turn encapsulated within
instance-level feature statistics in shallow CNN layers. Therefore, inserting
MixStyle modules in effect synthesizes novel domains albeit in an implicit way.
MixStyle is not only simple and flexible, but also versatile -- it can be used
for problems whereby unlabeled images are available, such as semi-supervised
domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation, with a simple
extension to mix feature statistics between labeled and pseudo-labeled

English English be explained as a consequence of spatial diffusion, or have
other processes created bias in favour of certain linguistic forms? Using two
of the most comprehensive spatial datasets available, which measure the state
of English at the beginning and end of the 20th century, we calibrate a simple
spatial model so that, initialised with the early state, it evolves into the
later. Our calibrations reveal that while some changes can be explained by
diffusion alone, others are clearly the result of substantial asymmetries
between variants. We discuss the origins of these asymmetries and, as a
by-product, we generate a full spatio-temporal prediction for the spatial
evolution of English features over the 20th Century, and a prediction of the

  Stochastic Knapsack","This is the full version of the SODA 2022 paper",,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Prophet inequalities are a useful tool for designing online allocation
procedures and comparing their performance to the optimal offline allocation.
In the basic setting of $k$-unit prophet inequalities, the magical procedure of
Alaei (2011) with its celebrated performance guarantee of
$1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+3}}$ has found widespread adoption in mechanism design and
other online allocation problems in online advertising, healthcare scheduling,
and revenue management. Despite being commonly used to derive
approximately-optimal algorithms for multi-resource allocation problems that
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, the tightness of Alaei's procedure for
a given $k$ has remained unknown. In this paper we resolve this question,
characterizing the optimal procedure and tight bound, and consequently
improving the best-known guarantee for $k$-unit prophet inequalities for all
$k>1$. We also consider a more general online stochastic knapsack problem where
each individual allocation can consume an arbitrary fraction of the initial
capacity. We introduce a new ""best-fit"" procedure for implementing a
fractionally-feasible knapsack solution online, with a performance guarantee of
$\frac{1}{3+e^{-2}}\approx0.319$, which we also show is tight. This improves
the previously best-known guarantee of 0.2 for online knapsack. Our analysis
differs from existing ones by eschewing the need to split items into ""large"" or
""small"" based on capacity consumption, using instead an invariant for the
overall utilization on different sample paths. Finally, we refine our technique
for the unit-density special case of knapsack, and improve the guarantee from
0.321 to 0.3557 in the multi-resource appointment scheduling application of
Stein et al. (2020).

emission mechanism, we performed a multi-frequency study of two very well-known
pulsars, PSR~B0919+06 and PSR~B1859+07. These pulsars show peculiar radio
emission properties whereby the emission shifts to an earlier rotation phase
before returning to the nominal emission phase in a few tens of pulsar
rotations (also known as `swooshes'). We confirm the previous claim that the
emission during the swoosh is not necessarily absent at low frequencies and the
single pulses during a swoosh show varied behaviour at 220~MHz. We also confirm
that in PSR~B0919+06, the pulses during the swoosh show a chromatic dependence
of the maximum offset from the normal emission phase with the offset following
a consistent relationship with observing frequency. We also observe that the
flux density spectrum of the radio profile during the swoosh is inverted
compared to the normal emission. For PSR~B1859+07, we have discovered a new
mode of emission in the pulsar that is potentially quasi-periodic with a
different periodicity than is seen in its swooshes. We invoke an emission model
previously proposed in the literature and show that this simple model can
explain the macroscopic observed characteristics in both pulsars. We also argue
that pulsars that exhibit similar variability on short timescales may have the
same underlying emission mechanism.

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo produces auto-correlated samples which results in high
variance in the estimators, and low effective sample size rates in the
generated samples. Adding antithetic sampling to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has

clustering is sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters, particularly for
deep learning based methods, which hinders its practical use. How to select a
proper network structure that may be dramatically different in different
applications is a hard issue for deep models, given little prior knowledge of
data. In this paper, we aim to automatically determine the optimal network
structure of a deep model, named multilayer bootstrap networks (MBN), via
simple ensemble learning and selection techniques. Specifically, we first
propose an MBN ensemble (MBN-E) algorithm which concatenates the sparse outputs
of a set of MBN base models with different network structures into a new
representation. Then, we take the new representation produced by MBN-E as a
reference for selecting the optimal MBN base models. Moreover, we propose a
fast version of MBN-E (fMBN-E), which is not only theoretically even faster
than a single standard MBN but also does not increase the estimation error of
MBN-E. Importantly, MBN-E and its ensemble selection techniques maintain the
simple formulation of MBN that is based on one-nearest-neighbor learning.
Empirically, comparing to a number of advanced deep clustering methods and as
many as 20 representative unsupervised ensemble learning and selection methods,
the proposed methods reach the state-of-the-art performance without manual
hyperparameter tuning. fMBN-E is empirically even hundreds of times faster than
MBN-E without suffering performance degradation. The applications to image

the type I seesaw mechanism, in which the CP violation (CPV) is provided by the

we investigate the 1-to-2 and the 2-to-3 flavour regime transitions, where the
1, 2 and 3 leptogenesis flavour regimes in the generation of the baryon
asymmetry of the Universe $\eta_B$ are described by the Boltzmann equations.
Concentrating on the 1-to-2 flavour transition we determine the general
conditions under which $\eta_B$ goes through zero and changes sign in the
transition. Analysing in detail the behaviour of $\eta_B$ in the transition in
the case of two heavy Majorana neutrinos $N_{1,2}$ with hierarchical masses,
$M_1 \ll M_2$, we find, in particular, that i) the Boltzmann equations in many
cases fail to describe correctly the generation of $\eta_B$ in the 1, 2 and 3
flavour regimes, ii) the 2-flavour regime can persist above (below) $\sim
10^{12}$ GeV ($\sim 10^9$ GeV), iii) the flavour effects in leptogenesis
persist beyond the typically considered maximal for these effects leptogenesis
scale of $10^{12}$ GeV. We further determine the minimal scale
$M_{1\text{min}}$ at which we can have successful leptogenesis when the CPV is
provided only by the Dirac or Majorana phases of the PMNS matrix as well as the
ranges of scales and values of the phases for having successful leptogenesis.
We show, in particular, that when the CPV is due to the Dirac phase $\delta$,
there is a direct relation between the sign of $\sin \delta$ and the sign of
$\eta_B$ in the regions of viable leptogenesis in the case of normal
hierarchical light neutrino mass spectrum; for the inverted hierarchical
spectrum the same result holds for $M_1 \lesssim 10^{13}$ GeV. The considered
scenarios of leptogenesis are testable and falsifiable in low-energy neutrino

typically used for prediction. Recently it has been shown that improper priors
assumed on multiple penalty parameters in RVM may lead to an improper
posterior. Currently in the literature, the sufficient conditions for posterior
propriety of RVM do not allow improper priors over the multiple penalty
parameters. In this article, we propose a single penalty relevance vector
machine (SPRVM) model in which multiple penalty parameters are replaced by a
single penalty and we consider a semi Bayesian approach for fitting the SPRVM.
The necessary and sufficient conditions for posterior propriety of SPRVM are
more liberal than those of RVM and allow for several improper priors over the
penalty parameter. Additionally, we also prove the geometric ergodicity of the
Gibbs sampler used to analyze the SPRVM model and hence can estimate the
asymptotic standard errors associated with the Monte Carlo estimate of the
means of the posterior predictive distribution. Such a Monte Carlo standard
error cannot be computed in the case of RVM, since the rate of convergence of
the Gibbs sampler used to analyze RVM is not known. The predictive performance

its complexity while keeping its performance almost intact. Most of the time,
sparsity is introduced using a three-stage pipeline: 1) train the model to
convergence, 2) prune the model according to some criterion, 3) fine-tune the
pruned model to recover performance. The last two steps are often performed
iteratively, leading to reasonable results but also to a time-consuming and
complex process. In our work, we propose to get rid of the first step of the
pipeline and to combine the two other steps in a single pruning-training cycle,
allowing the model to jointly learn for the optimal weights while being pruned.
We do this by introducing a novel pruning schedule, named One-Cycle Pruning,
which starts pruning from the beginning of the training, and until its very
end. Adopting such a schedule not only leads to better performing pruned models
but also drastically reduces the training budget required to prune a model.
Experiments are conducted on a variety of architectures (VGG-16 and ResNet-18)
and datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Caltech-101), and for relatively high
sparsity values (80%, 90%, 95% of weights removed). Our results show that
One-Cycle Pruning consistently outperforms commonly used pruning schedules such
as One-Shot Pruning, Iterative Pruning and Automated Gradual Pruning, on a

exploits the replicated nature of the data and improves on restrictive linear
model structure of conventional quantile regression. Relevant asymptotic theory
for the nonparametric estimators of the mean and variance function of the model
are derived under a very general framework. We provide a detailed simulation
study which clearly demonstrates the gain in efficiency of the proposed method
over other benchmark models, especially when the true data generating process
entails nonlinear mean function and heteroskedastic pattern with time dependent
covariates. The predictive accuracy of the non-parametric method is remarkably
high compared to other methods when attention is on the higher quantiles of the
variable of interest. Usefulness of the proposed method is then illustrated
with two climatological applications, one with a well-known tropical cyclone
wind-speed data and the other with an air pollution data.

cosmic rays through turbulent magnetic fields is described as a random walk
with cosmic rays scattering on magnetic field turbulence. This is in good
agreement with the highly isotropic cosmic ray arrival directions as this
diffusion process effectively isotropizes the cosmic ray distribution.
  High-statistics observatories like IceCube and HAWC have however observed
significant deviations from isotropy down to very small angular scales. This is
in strong tension with this standard picture of cosmic ray propagation. While
large scale multipoles arise naturally, for example due to the earth's motion
relative to the isotropic cosmic ray distribution, there is no intuitive
mechanism to account for the observed anisotropies at smaller angular scales.
  By relaxing one of the standard assumptions of quasi linear theory and
treating correlations between fluxes of cosmic rays from different directions
explicitly we show that higher multipoles also are to be expected from particle
propagation through turbulent magnetic fields. We present a first analytical
calculation of the angular power spectrum assuming a physically motivated model

conducted a study involving 31 systematically selected webinars on integrating
security tools in DevOps. We used a qualitative data analysis method, i.e.,
thematic analysis, to identify the challenges and emerging solutions related to
integrating security tools in rapid deployment environments. Results: We find
that while traditional security tools are unable to cater for the needs of
DevOps, the industry is moving towards new generations of tools that have
started focusing on these requirements. We have developed a DevOps workflow
that integrates security tools and a set of guidelines by synthesizing
practitioners' recommendations in the analyzed webinars. Conclusion: While the

are many tool-related drawbacks yet to be adequately addressed.

of circuits, we design a crossing-free layout for a composite half-adder

crossings are effectively avoided. Additionally, our design is shorter to speed
up computations compared to conventional designs. To address the key issue of
slow computation based on thermal excitations, we propose to overlay artificial
diffusion induced by an external excitation mechanism. For instance, if
magnetic skyrmions are used as tokens, artificially induced diffusion by
spin-orbit torques or other mechanisms increases the speed of computations by
several orders of magnitude. Combined with conventional Brownian computing the
latter could greatly enhance the application scenarios of token-based computing
for instance for low power devices such as autonomous sensors with limited

underlying dynamics of this technology. To address these gaps, we develop a
flexible experimental perfusion setup capable of monitoring and controlling key
variables such as perfusate flowrate, temperature, pressure, and oxygenation.
The paper (i) briefly summarizes the design of this setup; (ii) highlights the
degree to which its data acquisition system enables the collection and
cross-correlation of both perfusion-related and physiological variables; and
(iii) discusses the development of flow, pressure, and temperature control
algorithms for the setup. Experiments with large animals (swine) show that the
setup is capable of successfully controlling the perfusion process, as well as
gathering extensive data to support subsequent modeling and identification
studies.

already approved for use in humans, for the treatment of other diseases. For
example, the repurposing of dexamethasone and baricitinib has played a crucial
role in saving patient lives during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. There
remains a need to expand therapeutic approaches to prevent life-threatening
complications in patients with COVID-19. Using an in silico approach based on
structural similarity to drugs already in clinical trials for COVID-19,
potential drugs were predicted for repurposing. For a subset of identified
drugs with different targets to their corresponding COVID-19 clinical trial
drug, a mechanism of action analysis was applied to establish whether they
might have a role in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Of sixty drugs
predicted in this study, two with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
replication were identified using mechanism of action analysis. Triamcinolone
is a corticosteroid that is structurally similar to dexamethasone; gallopamil
is a calcium channel blocker that is structurally similar to verapamil. In
silico approaches indicate possible mechanisms of action for both drugs in
inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. The identification of these drugs as
potentially useful for patients with COVID-19 who are at a higher risk of
developing severe disease supports the use of in silico approaches to
facilitate quick and cost-effective drug repurposing. Such drugs could expand
the number of treatments available to patients who are not protected by
vaccination.

calculated the infrared cutoffs analytically. We represented the energy

showed a correspondence between the cosmology of a viscous fluid and
holographic cosmology. We analyzed the autonomous dynamic system. In the
absence of interaction between fluids, solutions are obtained corresponding to
two cases. In the first case, dark energy is missing and the extension
describes the component of dark matter. The second case corresponds to
cosmological models with an extension due to dark energy. The solutions
obtained are investigated for stability. For a cosmological model with the

improvements on those previously seen. Extensive experiments with different

$\ell_2$-based graph smoothing that enforces smoothness globally, in this work
we aim to further enhance the local smoothness adaptivity of GNNs via
$\ell_1$-based graph smoothing. As a result, we introduce a family of GNNs
(Elastic GNNs) based on $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$-based graph smoothing. In
particular, we propose a novel and general message passing scheme into GNNs.
This message passing algorithm is not only friendly to back-propagation
training but also achieves the desired smoothing properties with a theoretical
convergence guarantee. Experiments on semi-supervised learning tasks
demonstrate that the proposed Elastic GNNs obtain better adaptivity on
benchmark datasets and are significantly robust to graph adversarial attacks.

accurate prediction can be achieved with black box systems, they often lack

Alternatively, the dynamics can be analysed via symbolic regression. In this
paper, we extend the approach by (Udrescu et al., 2020) called AIFeynman to the
dynamic setting to perform symbolic regression on ODE systems based on
observations from the resulting trajectories. We compare this extension to
state-of-the-art approaches for symbolic regression empirically on several
dynamical systems for which the ground truth equations of increasing complexity
are available. Although the proposed approach performs best on this benchmark,
we observed difficulties of all the compared symbolic regression approaches on
more complex systems, such as Cart-Pole.

present SilGAN, a deep generative model that eases specification, stimulus
generation, and automation of automotive software-in-the-loop testing. The
model is trained using data recorded from vehicles in the field. Upon training,
the model uses a concise specification for a driving scenario to generate
realistic vehicle state transitions that can occur during such a scenario. Such
authentic emulation of internal vehicle behavior can be used for rapid,
systematic and inexpensive testing of vehicle control software. In addition, by
presenting a targeted method for searching through the information learned by
the model, we show how a test objective like code coverage can be automated.
The data driven end-to-end testing pipeline that we present vastly expands the
scope and credibility of automotive simulation-based testing. This reduces time
to market while helping maintain required standards of quality.

device manufacturers who own the source code. The MCU runs different
instruction sets than x86 and exposes a very different development environment.
This invalidates many existing sophisticated software testing tools on x86. To
maintain a unified developing and testing environment, a straightforward way is
to re-compile the source code into the native executable for a commodity
machine (called rehosting). However, ad-hoc re-hosting is a daunting and
tedious task and subject to many issues (library-dependence, kernel-dependence
and hardware-dependence). In this work, we systematically explore the
portability problem of MCU software and propose pararehosting to ease the
porting process. Specifically, we abstract and implement a portable MCU (PMCU)
using the POSIX interface. It models common functions of the MCU cores. For
peripheral specific logic, we propose HAL-based peripheral function
replacement, in which high-level hardware functions are replaced with an
equivalent backend driver on the host. These backend drivers are invoked by
well-designed para-APIs and can be reused across many MCU OSs. We categorize
common HAL functions into four types and implement templates for quick backend
development. Using the proposed approach, we have successfully rehosted nine
MCU OSs including the widely deployed Amazon FreeRTOS, ARM Mbed OS, Zephyr and
LiteOS. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of security
testing, we used off-the-shelf dynamic analysis tools (AFL and ASAN) against
the rehosted programs and discovered 28 previously-unknown bugs, among which 5
were confirmed by CVE and the other 19 were confirmed by vendors at the time of
writing.

contributions, we formalize the alignment problem in terms of an audiovisual
alignment tensor that is based on earlier VGS work, introduce systematic

cross-modal attention layer. We test our model and a previously proposed model
in the alignment task using SPEECH-COCO captions coupled with MSCOCO images. We
compare the alignment performance using our proposed evaluation metrics to the
semantic retrieval task commonly used to evaluate VGS models. We show that

special relativity: the invariance of any spacetime interval, and the Lorentz
transformation. We then develop the Lagrangian formulation of relativistic

potentials, the Lagrangian of a relativistic free particle, and Einstein's
