apps. User reviews in the textual form are unstructured data, creating a very
high complexity when processed for sentiment analysis. Previous approaches that
have been used often ignore the context of reviews. In addition, the relatively
small data makes the model overfitting. A new approach, BERT, has been
introduced as a transfer learning model with a pre-trained model that has
previously been trained to have a better context representation. This study
examines the effectiveness of fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis using two
different pre-trained models. Besides the multilingual pre-trained model, we
use the pre-trained model that only has been trained in Indonesian. The dataset
used is Indonesian user reviews of the ten best apps in 2020 in Google Play
sites. We also perform hyper-parameter tuning to find the optimum trained
model. Two training data labeling approaches were also tested to determine the
effectiveness of the model, which is score-based and lexicon-based. The
experimental results show that pre-trained models trained in Indonesian have
better average accuracy on lexicon-based data. The pre-trained Indonesian model
highest accuracy is 84%, with 25 epochs and a training time of 24 minutes.
These results are better than all of the machine learning and multilingual
pre-trained models.

measurement of the neutron skin thickness from the PREX collaboration has lead
to new constraints on the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy, L, which can be
directly compared to inferences from gravitational-wave observations of the
first binary neutron star merger inspiral, GW170817 In this paper, we explore a
new regime for potentially constraining the slope, L, of the nuclear symmetry
energy with future gravitational wave events: the post-merger phase a binary
neutron star coalescence. In particular, we go beyond the inspiral phase, where
imprints of the slope parameter L may be inferred from measurements of the
tidal deformability, to consider imprints on the post-merger dynamics,
gravitational wave emission, and dynamical mass ejection. To this end, we
perform a set of targeted neutron star merger simulations in full general
relativity using new finite-temperature equations of state, which
systematically vary L. We find that the post-merger dynamics and gravitational
wave emission are mostly insensitive to the slope of the nuclear symmetry
energy. In contrast, we find that dynamical mass ejection contains a weak
imprint of L, with large values of L leading to systematically enhanced ejecta.

removing rains from an image has become an important issue in the field. To
handle such an ill-posed single image deraining task, in this paper, we
specifically build a novel deep architecture, called rain convolutional
dictionary network (RCDNet), which embeds the intrinsic priors of rain streaks
and has clear interpretability. In specific, we first establish a RCD model for
representing rain streaks and utilize the proximal gradient descent technique
to design an iterative algorithm only containing simple operators for solving
the model. By unfolding it, we then build the RCDNet in which every network
module has clear physical meanings and corresponds to each operation involved
in the algorithm. This good interpretability greatly facilitates an easy
visualization and analysis on what happens inside the network and why it works
well in inference process. Moreover, taking into account the domain gap issue
in real scenarios, we further design a novel dynamic RCDNet, where the rain
kernels can be dynamically inferred corresponding to input rainy images and
then help shrink the space for rain layer estimation with few rain maps so as
to ensure a fine generalization performance in the inconsistent scenarios of
rain types between training and testing data. By end-to-end training such an
interpretable network, all involved rain kernels and proximal operators can be
automatically extracted, faithfully characterizing the features of both rain

show overall a good agreement, demonstrating that this method that allows to
infer the solar wind speed with WL-UV image ratio can be complementary to more

to identify the coronal regions where the ""quick inversion method"" performs at

only a fixed number of input images to predict novel view, proposed approach
works with different numbers of input images. The proposed model explicitly
performs feature extraction and matching from a given pair of input images and
estimates, at each pixel, the probability distribution (pdf) over possible
depth levels in the scene. This pdf is then used for estimating the novel view.
The model estimates multiple predictions of novel view, one estimate per input
image pair, from given image collection. The model also estimates an occlusion
mask and combines multiple novel view estimates in to a single optimal
prediction. The finite number of depth levels used in the analysis may cause
occasional blurriness in the estimated view. We mitigate this issue with simple
multi-resolution analysis which improves the quality of the estimates. We
substantiate the performance on different datasets and show competitive

(gapped) materials by varying the degrees of polynomials in their energy
dispersion relations, in which either the valence or conduction energy
dispersion depends on the wave vector raised to the power of two, four, and
six. The thermoelectric transport coefficients such as the Seebeck coefficient,
electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity are calculated within the
linearized Boltzmann transport theory combined with the relaxation time
approximation. We consider various effects such as band gaps, dimensionalities,
and dispersion powers to understand the conditions that can give the optimal
thermoelectric efficiency or figure of merit ($ZT$). Our calculations show that
the so-called pudding-mold band structure produces larger electrical and
thermal conductivities than the parabolic band, but no significant difference
is found in the Seebeck coefficients of the pudding-mold and parabolic bands.
Furthermore, we find that a high $ZT$ can be obtained by tuning the band gap of
the material to an optimum value simultaneously with breaking the band
symmetry. The largest $ZT$ is found in a combination of two-contrasting
polynomial powers in the dispersion relations of valence and conduction bands.
This band asymmetry also shifts the charge neutrality away from the undoped
level and allows optimal $ZT$ to be located at a smaller chemical potential.
With some reasonable values of thermal conductivity parameters, the maximum
$ZT$ for the bulk systems can be larger than 1, while for one-dimensional
systems it can even reach almost 4. We expect this work to trigger
high-throughput calculations for screening of potential thermoelectric
materials combining various polynomial powers in the energy dispersion
relations of semiconductors.

the effects of the magnetic field randomness on the heat transport. The
disorder, in general, causes localization of the normal modes due to which a
system becomes insulating. However, for this system, the localization length
diverges as the normal mode frequency approaches zero. Therefore, the low
frequency modes contribute to the transmission, $\mathcal{T}_N(\omega)$, and
the heat current goes down as a power law with the system size, $N$. This power
law is determined by the small frequency behaviour of some Lyapunov exponent,
$\lambda(\omega)$, and the transmission in the thermodynamic limit,
$\mathcal{T}_\infty(\omega)$. While it is known that in the presence of a
constant magnetic field $\mathcal{T}_\infty(\omega)\sim \omega^{3/2},~
\omega^{1/2}$ depending on the boundary conditions, we find that the Lyapunov
exponent for the system behaves as $\lambda(\omega)\sim\omega$ for

spacetime metric to constrain potential deviations from the predictions of GR

odometry framework. Building on a highly efficient tightly-coupled iterated
Kalman filter, FAST-LIO2 has two key novelties that allow fast, robust, and
accurate LiDAR navigation (and mapping). The first one is directly registering
raw points to the map (and subsequently update the map, i.e., mapping) without
extracting features. This enables the exploitation of subtle features in the
environment and hence increases the accuracy. The elimination of a
hand-engineered feature extraction module also makes it naturally adaptable to
emerging LiDARs of different scanning patterns; The second main novelty is
maintaining a map by an incremental k-d tree data structure, ikd-Tree, that
enables incremental updates (i.e., point insertion, delete) and dynamic
re-balancing. Compared with existing dynamic data structures (octree, R*-tree,
nanoflann k-d tree), ikd-Tree achieves superior overall performance while
naturally supports downsampling on the tree. We conduct an exhaustive benchmark
comparison in 19 sequences from a variety of open LiDAR datasets. FAST-LIO2
achieves consistently higher accuracy at a much lower computation load than
other state-of-the-art LiDAR-inertial navigation systems. Various real-world
experiments on solid-state LiDARs with small FoV are also conducted. Overall,
FAST-LIO2 is computationally-efficient (e.g., up to 100 Hz odometry and mapping
in large outdoor environments), robust (e.g., reliable pose estimation in
cluttered indoor environments with rotation up to 1000 deg/s), versatile (i.e.,
applicable to both multi-line spinning and solid-state LiDARs, UAV and handheld
platforms, and Intel and ARM-based processors), while still achieving higher
accuracy than existing methods. Our implementation of the system FAST-LIO2, and
the data structure ikd-Tree are both open-sourced on Github.

determines the naturalness and coherence of the generated talking face video.
Prior literature mainly focuses on speech-to-lip generation while there is a
paucity in text-to-lip (T2L) generation. T2L is a challenging task and existing
end-to-end works depend on the attention mechanism and autoregressive (AR)
decoding manner. However, the AR decoding manner generates current lip frame
conditioned on frames generated previously, which inherently hinders the
inference speed, and also has a detrimental effect on the quality of generated
lip frames due to error propagation. This encourages the research of parallel
T2L generation. In this work, we propose a parallel decoding model for fast and
high-fidelity text-to-lip generation (ParaLip). Specifically, we predict the
duration of the encoded linguistic features and model the target lip frames
conditioned on the encoded linguistic features with their duration in a
non-autoregressive manner. Furthermore, we incorporate the structural
similarity index loss and adversarial learning to improve perceptual quality of
generated lip frames and alleviate the blurry prediction problem. Extensive
experiments conducted on GRID and TCD-TIMIT datasets demonstrate the
superiority of proposed methods. Video samples are available via

brought to the fore the question of planet formation in binary systems. The
significant dynamical influence, during the protoplanetary disk phase, of a
binary companion on a giant planet has previously been highlighted for wide
binary stars. In particular, highly inclined binary companion can induce
perturbations on the disk and the planets, through the Lidov-Kozai resonance,
which could inhibit the formation process. In this work, we aim to study how
the disk gravitational potential acting on the planet and the nodal precession
\textbf{induced by the wide binary companion with separation of 1000 AU} on the
disk act to suppress the Lidov-Kozai perturbations on a migrating giant planet.
We derive new approximate formulas for the evolution of the disk's inclination
and longitude of the ascending node, in the case of a rigidly precessing disk
with a decreasing mass and perturbed by a wide binary companion, which are
suitable for $N$-body simulations. We carry out 3200 simulations with several
eccentricity and inclination values for the binary companion. The gravitational
and damping forces exerted by the disk on the planet tend to keep the latter in
the midplane of the former, and suppress the effect of the binary companion by
preventing the planet from getting locked in the Lidov-Kozai resonance during
the disk phase. We also confirm that because of nodal precession induced by the
binary, a primordial spin-orbit misalignment could be generated for
circumprimary planets with an inclined binary companion.

unique properties, including an extreme aspect ratio, a lack of typical

authors have hypothesized that the non-gravitational acceleration was caused by
either cometary outgassing or radiation pressure. Here, we investigate the spin
dynamics of `Oumuamua under the action of high surface area fractional activity
and radiation pressure. We demonstrate that a series of transient jets that
migrate across the illuminated surface will not produce a secular increase in
the spin rate. We produce 3D tumbling simulations that approximate the dynamics
of a surface covering jet, and show that the resulting synthetic light curve
and periodogram are reasonably consistent with the observations. Moreover, we
demonstrate that radiation pressure also produces a steady spin-state. While
carbon monoxide (CO) has been dismissed as a possible accelerant because of its
non-detection in emission by $\textit{Spitzer}$, we show that outgassing from a
surface characterized by a modest covering fraction of CO ice can satisfy the
non-ballistic dynamics for a plausible range of assumed bulk densities and
surface albedos. $\textit{Spitzer}$ upper limits on CO emission are, however,
inconsistent with the CO production necessary to provide the acceleration.
Nonetheless, an ad hoc but physically plausible explanation is that the
activity level varied greatly during the time that the trajectory was
monitored. We reproduce the astrometric analysis presented in Micheli et al.

stochastic changes in outgassing.

optimize RDMA and PM, thus partially addressing the problems of RDMA Access
Amplification and High-Overhead PM Consistency. In order to address these
problems, we propose a continuity hashing, which is a ""one-stone-two-birds""
design to optimize both RDMA and PM. The continuity hashing leverages a
fine-grained contiguous shared region, called SBuckets, to provide standby

continuity hashing, remote read only needs a single RDMA read to directly fetch
the home bucket and the neighbouring SBuckets, which contain all the positions
of maintaining a key-value item, thus alleviating RDMA access amplification.
Continuity hashing further leverages indicators that can be atomically modified

results demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art schemes, continuity
hashing achieves high throughput (i.e., 1.45X -- 2.43X improvement), low

eigenfunction and the eigenvalue of the so-called Rayleigh equation in a
semi-infinite domain. Because of the small air-water density ratio,
$\rho_{\rm{a}}/\rho_{\rm{w}}\equiv\epsilon<<1$, the wind and the ripples are
weakly coupled, and the eigenvalue problem can be solved perturbatively. At the
leading order, the eigenvalue is equal to the phase speed $c_0$ of surface

implies growth. Miles (1957) showed that the growth rate is proportional to the
square modulus of the leading-order eigenfunction evaluated at the so-called

Proof of Work algorithm, maximum allowed size for a block, decrease in
intelligibility with the increase of the number of blocks in the chain,
domination of nodes with higher computing power as miners and validators. These
factors have restricted the adoption of permissionless blockchain technology
outside the field of finance, such as in medical or legal fields. This paper
proposes a solution to these problems using a permissioned blockchain. It does
not require a computationally expensive consensus mechanism as permissioned
chains call for trust between participating organizations which is achieved via
exclusive invitations. We have utilized a third-party orderer to maintain the
trust between organizations.

averages are considered for various subregions in the worldvolume. We prove
that, if a sample in the worldvolume is generated as a Markov chain, then the
subsample in the subregion can also be regarded as a Markov chain. This ensures
the application of the standard statistical techniques to the WV-HMC algorithm.
We particularly investigate the autocorrelation times for the Markov chains in

the antiproton flux over the predicted models at around $10$ GeV, which can be
the signature of dark matter annihilating into hadronic final states that
subsequently form antiprotons. However, this excess is subject to many
uncertainties related to the evaluation of the antiproton spectrum produced
from spallation interactions of CRs. In this work, we implement a combined
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the secondary ratios of B, Be and Li and
the antiproton-to-proton ratio ($\bar{p}/p$), while also including nuisance
parameters to consider the uncertainties related to the spallation cross
sections. This study allows us to constrain the Galactic halo height and the
rest of propagation parameters, evaluate the impact of cross sections
uncertainties in the determination of the antiproton spectrum and test the
origin of the excess of antiprotons. In this way, we provide a set of
propagation parameters and scale factors for renormalizing the cross sections
parametrizations that allow us to reproduce all the ratios of B, Be, Li and
$\bar{p}$ simultaneously. We show that the energy dependence of the $\bar{p}/p$
ratio is compatible with a pure secondary origin. We find that the energy
dependence of the evaluated $\bar{p}/p$ spectrum matches the AMS-02 data at
energies above $\sim3$GeV, although there is still a nearly constant $\sim10\%$
excess of $\bar{p}$ over our prediction. We discuss that this discrepancy is
more likely explained from a $\sim10\%$ scaling in the cross sections of
antiproton production, rather than a component of dark matter leading to
antiprotons. In particular, we find that the best-fit WIMP mass ($\sim 300$
GeV) needed to explain the discrepancy lies above the constraints from most
indirect searches of dark matter and the resultant fit is poorer than with a
cross sections scaling.

sample sizes. Both methods also showed equivalent detection in data with weak
but reliable effects until sample sizes drop below n=50. In the case of strong
effects, both methods showed similar performance unless the correlations of
items within one data block were high. For PLS, the results were reproducible
across sample sizes for strong effects, except at the smallest sample sizes. On
the contrary, the reproducibility for CCA declined when the within-block
correlations were high. This was ameliorated if a principal components analysis
(PCA) was performed and the component scores used to calculate the cross-block
matrix. The outcome of our examination gives three messages. First, for data
with reasonable within and between block structure, CCA and PLS give comparable
results. Second, if there are high correlations within either block, this can
compromise the reliability of CCA results. This known issue of CCA can be
remedied with PCA before cross-block calculation. This, however, assumes that
the PCA structure is stable for a given sample. Third, null hypothesis testing

static dataset of prior experiments. Such data-driven optimization procedures
are the only practical methods in many real-world domains where active data
collection is expensive (e.g., when optimizing over proteins) or dangerous
(e.g., when optimizing over aircraft designs). Typical methods for MBO that
optimize the design against a learned model suffer from distributional shift:
it is easy to find a design that ""fools"" the model into predicting a high
value. To overcome this, we propose conservative objective models (COMs), a
method that learns a model of the objective function that lower bounds the
actual value of the ground-truth objective on out-of-distribution inputs, and
uses it for optimization. Structurally, COMs resemble adversarial training
methods used to overcome adversarial examples. COMs are simple to implement and
outperform a number of existing methods on a wide range of MBO problems,

weights, and superconducting materials.

of optimization problems. In a QCQP, we are asked to minimize a (possibly
nonconvex) quadratic function subject to a number of (possibly nonconvex)
quadratic constraints. Such problems arise naturally in many areas of
operations research, computer science, and engineering. Although QCQPs are
NP-hard to solve in general, they admit a natural convex relaxation via the
standard (Shor) semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation. In this tutorial, we
will study the SDP relaxation for general QCQPs, present various exactness
concepts related to this relaxation and discuss conditions guaranteeing such
SDP exactness. In particular, we will define and examine three notions of SDP
exactness: (i) objective value exactness -- the condition that the optimal
value of the QCQP and the optimal value of its SDP relaxation coincide, (ii)
convex hull exactness -- the condition that the convex hull of the QCQP
epigraph coincides with the (projected) SDP epigraph, and (iii) the rank-one
generated (ROG) property -- the condition that a particular conic subset of the
positive semidefinite matrices related to a given QCQP is generated by its
rank-one matrices. Our analysis for objective value exactness and convex hull
exactness stems from a geometric treatment of the projected SDP relaxation and
crucially considers how the objective function interacts with the constraints.
The ROG property complements these results by offering a sufficient condition
for both objective value exactness and convex hull exactness which is oblivious
to the objective function. We will give a variety of sufficient conditions for
these exactness conditions and discuss settings where these sufficient
conditions are additionally necessary. Throughout, we will highlight
implications of our results for a number of example applications.

$b_{\phi}$ and $b_{\phi\delta}$, which enter at leading order in the galaxy
power spectrum and bispectrum. This is the first time that $b_{\phi\delta}$ is
measured from either gravity-only or galaxy formation simulations. For dark
matter halos, the popular assumption of universality overpredicts the
$b_{\phi\delta}(b_1)$ relation in the range $1 \lesssim b_1 \lesssim 3$ by up
to $\Delta b_{\phi\delta} \sim 3$ ($b_1$ is the linear density bias). The
adequacy of the universality relation is worse for the simulated galaxies, with
the relations $b_{\phi}(b_1)$ and $b_{\phi\delta}(b_1)$ being generically
redshift-dependent and very sensitive to how galaxies are selected (we test
total, stellar and black hole mass, black hole mass accretion rate and color).
The uncertainties on $b_{\phi}$ and $b_{\phi\delta}$ have a direct, often
overlooked impact on the constraints of the local PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$,
which we study and discuss. For a survey with $V = 100{\rm Gpc}^3/h^3$ at
$z=1$, uncertainties $\Delta b_{\phi} \lesssim 1$ and $\Delta b_{\phi\delta}
\lesssim 5$ around values close to the fiducial can yield relatively unbiased
constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$ using power spectrum and bispectrum data. We also
show why priors on galaxy bias are useful even in analyses that fit for
products $f_{\rm NL} b_{\phi}$ and $f_{\rm NL} b_{\phi\delta}$. The strategies
we discuss to deal with galaxy bias uncertainties can be straightforwardly
implemented in existing $f_{\rm NL}$ constraint analyses (we provide fits for
some of the bias relations). Our results motivate more works with galaxy
formation simulations to refine our understanding of $b_{\phi}$ and
$b_{\phi\delta}$ towards improved constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$.

cross-spectrum of accreting black holes as a function of energy. The model
accounts for continuum lags and reverberation lags self-consistently in order
to consider the widest possible range of X-ray variability timescales. We
introduce a more self-consistent treatment of the reverberation lags,
accounting for how the time variations of the illuminating flux change the
ionisation level of the accretion disc. This process varies the shape of the
reflection spectrum in time causing an additional source of lags besides the
light crossing delay. We also consider electron densities in the accretion disc
up to $10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, which are found in most of the stellar mass black
holes and in some AGN. These high densities increase the amplitude of the
reverberation lags below $1$ keV since the reflection flux enhances in the same
energy range. In addition, we investigate the properties of hard lags produced
by variations in the power-law index of the continuum spectrum, which can be
interpreted as due to roughly $3\%$ variability in the corona's optical depth
and temperature. As a test case, we simultaneously fit the lag energy spectra
in a wide range of Fourier frequency for the black hole candidate MAXI
J1820+070 observed with NICER. The best fit shows how the reverberation lags
contribute even at the longer timescales where the hard lags are important.
This proves the importance of modelling these two lags together and
self-consistently in order to constrain the parameters of the system.

Furthermore, by analyzing the high moments ($\alpha>1$) of the Husimi function,
we are able to identify qualitatively and quantitatively the unstable periodic

massive $z\gtrsim 6$ quasars, but their formation requires fine-tuned
conditions. In this work, we use cosmological zoom simulations to study
systematically the impact of requiring: 1) low gas angular momentum, and 2) a
minimum incident Lyman-Werner~(LW) flux in order to form BH seeds. We probe the
formation of seeds (with initial masses of $M_{\rm seed} \sim 10^4$ - $10^6
M_{\odot}/h)$ in halos with a total mass $> 3000\times M_{\mathrm{seed}}$ and a
dense, metal poor gas mass $> 5\times M_{\mathrm{seed}}$. We find that the
seed-forming halos have a prior history of star formation and metal enrichment,
but contain pockets of dense, metal poor gas. When seeding is further
restricted to halos with low gas spins, the number of seeds formed is
suppressed by factors of $\sim6$ compared to the baseline model, regardless of
the seed mass. Seed formation is much more strongly impacted if the dense,
metal poor gas is required to have a critical LW flux ($J_{\mathrm{crit}}$).
Even for $J_{\mathrm{crit}}$ values as low as $50J_{21}$, no
$8\times10^{5}M_{\odot}/h$ seeds are formed. While lower mass
($1.25\times10^{4},1\times10^{5} M_{\odot}/h$) seeds do form, they are strongly
suppressed~(by factors of $\sim10-100$) compared to the baseline model at gas
mass resolutions of $\sim10^4~M_{\odot}/h$ (with even stronger suppression at
higher resolutions). As a result, BH merger rates are also similarly
suppressed. Since early BH growth is dominated by mergers in our models, no
seeds are able to grow to the supermassive regime~($\gtrsim10^6 M_{\odot}/h$)
by $z=7$. Our results hint that producing the bulk of the $z\gtrsim6$
supermassive BH population may require alternate seeding scenarios that do not
depend on the LW flux, early BH growth dominated by rapid or super-Eddington
accretion, or a combination of these possibilities.

orbits with a broad distribution of eccentricities. Those with the most
eccentric orbits are valuable laboratories for testing theories of high
eccentricity migration. However, few such exoplanets transit their host stars
thus removing the ability to apply constraints on formation from their bulk
internal compositions. We report the discovery of Kepler-1704 b, a transiting
4.15 $M_{\rm J}$ giant planet on a 988.88 day orbit with the extreme
eccentricity of $0.921^{+0.010}_{-0.015}$. Our decade-long RV baseline from the
Keck I telescope allows us to measure the orbit and bulk heavy element
composition of Kepler-1704 b and place limits on the existence of undiscovered
companions. Kepler-1704 b is a failed hot Jupiter that was likely excited to
high eccentricity by scattering events that possibly began during its gas
accretion phase. Its final periastron distance was too large to allow for tidal
circularization, so now it orbits it host from distances spanning 0.16 - 3.9
au. The maximum difference in planetary equilibrium temperature resulting from
this elongated orbit is over 700 K. A simulation of the thermal phase curve of
Kepler-1704 b during periastron passage demonstrates that it is a remarkable
target for atmospheric characterization from the James Webb Space Telescope,
which could potentially also measure the planet's rotational period as the hot
spot from periastron rotates in and out of view. Continued characterization of
the Kepler-1704 system promises to refine theories explaining the formation of
hot Jupiters and cool giant planets like those in the solar system.

The

analogy with Landau levels, constant Berry curvature has been suggested as an
ideal condition for realizing fractional Chern insulators. Here we show that
while the Berry curvature cannot be made constant in a topological two-band
model, lattice models with three or more degrees of freedom per unit cell can
support exactly constant Berry curvature. However, contrary to the intuitive
expectation, we find that making the Berry curvature constant does not always
improve the properties of bosonic fractional Chern insulator states. In fact,
we show that an ""ideal flatband"" cannot have constant Berry curvature,
equivalently, we show that the density algebra of Landau levels cannot be
realised in any tight-binding lattice system.

out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, but such models have been shown to assign
higher probabilities or densities to OOD images than images from the training

to model misestimation. We first prove that no method can guarantee performance
beyond random chance without assumptions on which out-distributions are

distribution's typical set. We highlight the consequences implied by assuming
support overlap between in- and out-distributions, as well as the arbitrariness
of the typical set for OOD detection. Our results suggest that estimation error
is a more plausible explanation than the misalignment between likelihood-based
OOD detection and out-distributions of interest, and we illustrate how even

all of these elements are present. We consider interacting quantum particles in
two dimensions in a strong magnetic field such that the Hilbert space is
restricted to the Lowest Landau Level (LLL). This is the familiar quantum Hall
regime with rich physics determined by the particle filling and statistics. A
periodic potential with a unit cell enclosing one flux quantum broadens the LLL
into a Chern band with a finite bandwidth. The states obtained in the quantum
Hall regime evolve into conducting states in the limit of large bandwidth. We
study this evolution in detail for the specific case of bosons at filling
factor $\nu = 1$. In the quantum Hall regime the ground state at this filling
is a gapped quantum hall state (the ""bosonic Pfaffian"") which may be viewed as
descending from a (bosonic) composite fermi liquid. At large bandwidth the
ground state is a bosonic superfluid. We show how both phases and their
evolution can be described within a single theoretical framework based on a LLL
composite fermion construction. Building on our previous work on the bosonic
composite fermi liquid, we show that the evolution into the superfluid can be
usefully described by a non-commutative quantum field theory in a periodic

sample (0.01 < z < 0.05, Mr < -18.96) which contains 1,867 galaxies with
reliable volunteer bar classifications in the ALFALFA footprint. In keeping
with previous Galaxy Zoo surveys (such as GZ2), the morphological
classifications from GZD agree well with previous morphological surveys. GZD
considers galaxies to either have a strong bar (15.5%), a weak bar (28.1%) or
no bar (56.4%), based on volunteer classifications on images obtained from the
DECaLS survey. This places GZD in a unique position to assess differences
between strong and weak bars. We find that the strong bar fraction is typically
higher in quiescent galaxies than in star forming galaxies, while the weak bar
fraction is similar. Moreover, we have found that strong bars facilitate the
quenching process in star forming galaxies, finding higher fibre SFRs, lower
gas masses and shorter depletion timescales in these galaxies compared to
unbarred galaxies. However, we also found that any differences between strong
and weak bars disappear when controlling for bar length. Based on this, we
conclude that weak and strong bars are not fundamentally different phenomena.
Instead, we propose that there is a continuum of bar types, which varies from
'weakest' to 'strongest'.

  Filter Fusion",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mainstream approach for filter pruning is usually either to force a
hard-coded importance estimation upon a computation-heavy pretrained model to
select ""important"" filters, or to impose a hyperparameter-sensitive sparse
constraint on the loss objective to regularize the network training. In this
paper, we present a novel filter pruning method, dubbed dynamic-coded filter
fusion (DCFF), to derive compact CNNs in a computation-economical and
regularization-free manner for efficient image classification. Each filter in
our DCFF is firstly given an inter-similarity distribution with a temperature
parameter as a filter proxy, on top of which, a fresh Kullback-Leibler
divergence based dynamic-coded criterion is proposed to evaluate the filter
importance. In contrast to simply keeping high-score filters in other methods,
we propose the concept of filter fusion, i.e., the weighted averages using the
assigned proxies, as our preserved filters. We obtain a one-hot
inter-similarity distribution as the temperature parameter approaches infinity.
Thus, the relative importance of each filter can vary along with the training
of the compact CNN, leading to dynamically changeable fused filters without
both the dependency on the pretrained model and the introduction of sparse
constraints. Extensive experiments on classification benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our DCFF over the compared counterparts. For example, our DCFF
derives a compact VGGNet-16 with only 72.77M FLOPs and 1.06M parameters while
reaching top-1 accuracy of 93.47% on CIFAR-10. A compact ResNet-50 is obtained

clear since flat space gravity has an entirely different vacuum and infrared
structure than the gapped and unique AdS vacuum, which was exploited in Raju's
toy model. We answer this question in the affirmative, with an explicit
construction. We formulate the paradox in terms of monogamy of CHSH
correlations, which we use to quantify the monogamy of entanglement. Extending
Raju's analysis to empty flat space, within effective field theory, we show
that the entanglement of approximately local bulk modes just outside a light
cone with modes just inside the light cone as well as with modes situated far
away at the past of future null infinity gives rise to an O($1$) violation in
the monogamy of entanglement. This cannot be resolved by small corrections of
O($\sqrt{G_N}$). The issues arising from the above-mentioned vacuum and
infrared features unique to flat spacetime are dealt with by introducing a
physically motivated boundary projector onto states below a given infrared
cutoff, which allows us to construct suitable operators at the past of future
null infinity that give rise to the violation. We argue that the resolution of
the paradox is that our spatially separated observables probe the same
underlying degrees of freedom, i.e., such observables act on a non-factorized
Hilbert space arising from the Gauss constraint, thereby circumventing the
conflict with monogamy of entanglement.

ringed spiral galaxies with the aim of assessing the effects of rings on disk
galaxy properties. Methods: We built a catalog of ringed galaxies from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 (SDSS-DR14). Via visual inspection of
SDSS images, we classified the face-on spiral galaxies brighter than $g < 16.0$
mag into galaxies with: an inner ring, an outer ring, a nuclear ring, both an
inner and an outer ring, and a pseudo-ring. In addition to rings, we recorded
morphological types and the existence of bars, lenses, and galaxy pair
companions with or without interaction. With the goal of providing an
appropriate quantification of the influence of rings on galaxy properties, we
also constructed a suitable control sample of non-ringed galaxies with similar
redshift, magnitude, morphology, and local density environment distributions to
those of ringed ones. Results: We found 1868 ringed galaxies, accounting for
22% of the full sample of spiral galaxies. In addition, within galaxies with
ringed structures, 46% have an inner ring, 10% an outer ring, 20% both an inner
and an outer ring, 6% a nuclear ring, and 18% a partial ring. Moreover, 64% of
the ringed galaxies present bars. We also found that ringed galaxies have both
a lower efficiency of star formation activity and older stellar populations (as
derived with the $D_n(4000)$ spectral index) with respect to non-ringed disk
objects from the control sample. Galaxies with ringed structures present an
excess of high metallicity values compared to non-ringed ones, which show a $12
+ \rm Log (\rm O /\rm H)$ distribution toward lower values. These findings seem
to indicate that rings are peculiar structures that produce an accelerating
galactic evolution, strongly altering the physical properties of their host
galaxies.

$\Delta_+(t)$ is nonzero. However, we show that fluctuations in the initial

two other types of late time dynamics -- phase I where both order parameters
decay to zero and phase II where $\Delta_+(t)$ asymptotes to a nonzero constant

favored in the Hamiltonian, the other one rapidly vanishes and the previously

seen in the integrable chiral $p$-wave model.

a test statistic based on the density model score function (i.e. gradient with

used for computing the necessary statistics including deep density models such

and of the noise are unknown. This regression task can be rephrased as a
statistical mechanics model known as the Gardner spin glass, an analogy which
we exploit. Using a leave-one-out approach we characterize the mean-square
error for the regression coefficients. We also derive the log-normalizing
constant of the posterior. Similar models have been studied by Shcherbina and
Tirozzi and by Talagrand, but our arguments are much more straightforward. An
interesting consequence of our analysis is that in the quadratic loss case, the
performance of the Bayesian estimator is independent of a global ""temperature""
hyperparameter and matches the ridge estimator: sampling and optimizing are
equally good.

overcome this burden, we reformulate the problem using a piecewise affine
approximation of the travel latency function which allows us to exploit the
total unimodularity property of Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Consequently,
we transform the ILP problem to a linear program by relaxing the integer
variables. In addition, our method is capable of solving the problem for a
desired number of lane reversals which serves to perform cost-benefit analysis.
We perform a case study using the transportation network of Eastern

quantify the travel time savings for different levels of demand intensity. We
observe reduction in travel times up to 40% for certain links in the network.

model of a selection procedure, is of profound importance to scientific
discoveries. In practice, it is often statistically hopeless to identify all
the important features with no false discovery, let alone the intimidating
expense of experiments to test their significance. Such realistic limitation
calls for statistical guarantee for the early discoveries of a model selector.
In this paper, we focus on the early solution path of best subset selection
(BSS), where the sparsity constraint is set to be lower than {the true
sparsity}. Under a sparse high-dimensional linear model, we establish the
sufficient and (near) necessary condition for BSS to achieve sure early
selection, or equivalently, zero false discovery throughout its early path.
Essentially, this condition boils down to a lower bound of the minimum
projected signal margin that characterizes the gap of the captured signal
strength between sure selection models and those with spurious discoveries.
Defined through projection operators, this margin is independent of the
restricted eigenvalues of the design, suggesting the robustness of BSS against
collinearity. Moreover, our model selection guarantee tolerates reasonable
optimization error and thus applies to near best subsets. Finally, to overcome
the computational hurdle of BSS under high dimension, we propose the ""screen
then select"" (STS) strategy to reduce dimension for BSS. Our numerical
experiments show that the resulting early path exhibits much lower false
discovery rate (FDR) than LASSO, MCP and SCAD, especially in the presence of
highly correlated design. We also investigate the early paths of the iterative
hard thresholding algorithms, which are greedy computational surrogates for
BSS, and which yield comparable FDR as our STS procedure.

This is in exact analogy to the relativity principle as it pertains to the
invariant measurement of the speed of light c at the foundation of special
relativity (SR). Essentially, quantum information theorists have extended
Einstein's use of NPRF from the boost invariance of measurements of c to
include the SO(3) invariance of measurements of h between different reference
frames of mutually complementary spin measurements via the principle of
Information Invariance & Continuity. Consequently, the ""mystery"" of the Bell
states that is responsible for the Tsirelson bound and the exclusion of the
no-signalling, ""superquantum"" Popescu-Rohrlich joint probabilities is
understood to result from conservation per Information Invariance & Continuity
between different reference frames of mutually complementary qubit
measurements, and this maps to conservation per NPRF in spacetime. If one
falsely conflates the relativity principle with the classical theory of SR,
then it may seem impossible that the relativity principle resides at the
foundation of non-relativisitic QM. In fact, there is nothing inherently
classical or quantum about NPRF. Thus, the axiomatic reconstructions of QM have
succeeded in producing a principle account of QM that reveals as much about
Nature as the postulates of SR.

is compatible with maximal accuracy when the target label is deterministic with

  In the probabilistic case, however, the issue is more complicated: It has
been shown that under differential privacy constraints, there are data sources
for which EO can only be achieved at the total detriment of accuracy, in the
sense that a classifier that satisfies EO cannot be more accurate than a
trivial (i.e., constant) classifier. In our paper we strengthen this result by
removing the privacy constraint. Namely, we show that for certain data sources,
the most accurate classifier that satisfies EO is a trivial classifier.
Furthermore, we study the trade-off between accuracy and EO loss (opportunity
difference), and provide a sufficient condition on the data source under which
EO and non-trivial accuracy are compatible.

variety of fractional widths, including as low as $10\%$ on some days. The
fractional width is very interesting as it has the potential to discriminate
between different astrophysical scenarios for the source; in fact, the
$10$--$20\%$ range is so narrow as to be in tension with theoretical

KaiABC protein system found in the cyanobacteria $S. \ elongatus$. In
particular, our minimal model explicitly accounts for two experimentally
characterized biophysical features of the KaiABC protein system, namely, a
differential binding affinity and an ultrasensitive response. Our analytical
work shows how these mechanisms might be crucial for promoting robust
oscillations even in sub optimal nutrient conditions. Our analytical and
numerical work also identifies mechanisms by which biological clocks can stably
maintain a constant time period under a variety of nutrient conditions.
Finally, our work also explores the thermodynamic costs associated with the
generation of robust sustained oscillations and shows that the net rate of
entropy production alone might not be a good figure of merit to asses the
quality of oscillations.

crawl. Modeling hyper-text has a number of advantages: (1) it is easily
gathered at scale, (2) it provides rich document-level and end-task-adjacent
supervision (e.g. class and id attributes often encode document category
information), and (3) it allows for new structured prompting that follows the
established semantics of HTML (e.g. to do zero-shot summarization by infilling
title tags for a webpage that contains the input text). We show that
pretraining with a BART-style denoising loss directly on simplified HTML
provides highly effective transfer for a wide range of end tasks and
supervision levels. HTLM matches or exceeds the performance of comparably sized
text-only LMs for zero-shot prompting and fine-tuning for classification
benchmarks, while also setting new state-of-the-art performance levels for
zero-shot summarization. We also find that hyper-text prompts provide more
value to HTLM, in terms of data efficiency, than plain text prompts do for
existing LMs, and that HTLM is highly effective at auto-prompting itself, by
simply generating the most likely hyper-text formatting for any available
training data. We will release all code and models to support future HTLM
research.

  schemes for multiscale time dependent PDEs",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This article is devoted to the construction of a new class of semi-Lagrangian
(SL) schemes with implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) time stepping for
PDEs involving multiple space-time scales. The semi-Lagrangian (SL) approach
fully couples the space and time discretization, thus making the use of RK
strategies particularly difficult to be combined with. First, a simple scalar
advection-diffusion equation is considered as a prototype PDE for the
development of a high order formulation of the semi-Lagrangian IMEX algorithms.
The advection part of the PDE is discretized explicitly at the aid of a SL
technique, while an implicit discretization is employed for the diffusion
terms. Second, the SL-IMEX approach is extended to deal with hyperbolic systems
with multiple scales, including balance laws, that involve shock waves and
other discontinuities. A novel SL technique is proposed, which is based on the
integration of the governing equations over the space-time control volume which
arises from the motion of each grid point. High order of accuracy is ensured by
the usage of IMEX RK schemes combined with a Cauchy-Kowalevskaya procedure that
provides a predictor solution within each space-time element. The
one-dimensional shallow water equations (SWE) are chosen to validate the new
conservative SL-IMEX schemes, where convection and pressure fluxes are treated
explicitly and implicitly, respectively. The asymptotic-preserving (AP)
property of the novel schemes is also studied considering a relaxation PDE
system for the SWE. A large suite of convergence studies for both the
non-conservative and the conservative version of the novel class of methods
demonstrates that the formal order of accuracy is achieved and numerical
evidences about the conservation property are shown. The AP property for the
corresponding relaxation system is also investigated.

gluing singly periodic Karcher--Scherk saddle towers along their wings. This
paper aims to construct singly periodic minimal surfaces with Scherk ends. As
in the first paper, we prescribe phase differences between saddle towers, and
reveal that the saddle towers must be balanced under a subtle vertical
interaction. As a consequence, we obtain many new examples without any
horizontal reflection plane. Since the construction is not very different from
previous ones, we will only provide sketched proofs.
  The major technical concern of the paper is to determine the embeddedness,
for which we will provide detailed arguments. Previously, embeddedness can not
be determined in the presence of ""parallel"" Scherk ends, as it was not clear if
they bend towards or away from each other. Our construction provide
possibilities to detect very slight bendings of Scherk ends. This allows us to
identify new scenarios where the constructed surfaces are embedded.

locally on resource-constrained edge devices. ML networks with large
convolutional layers can easily exceed available memory, increasing latency due
to excessive swapping. Previous memory reduction techniques such as pruning and
quantization reduce model accuracy and often require retraining. Alternatively,
distributed methods partition the convolutions into equivalent smaller
sub-computations, but the implementations introduce communication costs and
require a network of devices. However, a distributed partitioning approach can
also be used to run in a reduced memory footprint on a single device by
subdividing the network into smaller operations.
  This report extends prior work on distributed partitioning using tiling and
fusing of convolutional layers into a memory-aware execution on a single
device. Our approach extends prior fusing strategies to allow for two groups of
convolutional layers that are fused and tiled independently. This approach
reduces overhead via data reuse, and reduces the memory footprint further. We
also propose a memory usage predictor coupled with a search algorithm to
provide fusing and tiling configurations for an arbitrary set of convolutional
layers. When applied to the YOLOv2 object detection network, results show that
our approach can run in less than half the memory, and with a speedup of up to
2.78 under severe memory constraints. Additionally, our algorithm will return a
configuration with a latency that is within 6% of the best latency measured in
a manual search.

in downlink multi-antenna multicarrier systems with frequency-packed
faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling. The resulting interference stems from an
aggressive strategy for enhancing the throughput via frequency reuse across
different users and the squeezing of signals in the time-frequency plane beyond
the Nyquist limit. The error-free spectral efficiency is proved to be
increasing with the frequency packing and FTN acceleration factors. The lower
bound for the FTN sampling period that guarantees information losslesness is
derived as a function of the transmitting-filter roll-off factor, the
frequency-packing factor, and the number of subcarriers. Space-time-frequency
symbol-level precoders (SLPs) that trade off constructive and destructive
interblock interference (IBI) at the single-antenna user terminals are
proposed. Redundant elements are added as guard interval to cope with vestigial
destructive IBI effects. The proposals can handle channels with delay spread
longer than the multicarrier-symbol duration. The receiver architecture is
simple, for it does not require digital multicarrier demodulation. Simulations
indicate that the proposed SLP outperforms zero-forcing precoding and achieves
a target balance between spectral and energy efficiencies by controlling the
amount of added redundancy from zero (full IBI) to half (destructive IBI-free)
the group delay of the equivalent channel.

telescope at ~2' resolution toward five positions in OMC-2 and OMC-3. Since the
CRRLs have similar line properties, we averaged them to increase the

averaged CRRLs, and the 158 {\mu}m-[CII] and [$^{13}$CII] lines to the
predictions of a homogeneous model for the C$^{+}$/C interface in the envelope
of a molecular cloud and from this comparison we determined the electron

confirms that they trace the envelope of the ISF. Toward two positions we

  media outlets","25 pages, 7 tables",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, social media platforms have introduced several measures to counter
misleading information. Among these measures are state media labels which help
users identify and evaluate the credibility of state-backed news. YouTube was
the first platform to introduce labels that provide information about
state-backed news channels. While previous work has examined the efficiency of
information labels in controlled lab settings, few studies have examined how
state media labels affect user perceptions of content from state-backed
outlets. This paper proposes new methodological and theoretical approaches to
investigate the effect of state media labels on user engagement with content.
Drawing on a content analysis of 8,071 YouTube comments posted before and after
the labelling of five state-funded channels (Al Jazeera English, CGTN, RT, TRT
World, and Voice of America), this paper analyses the effect state media labels
had on user engagement with state-backed media content. We found the labels had
no impact on the amount of likes videos received before and after the policy
introduction, except for RT which received less likes after it was labelled.
However, for RT, comments left by users were associated with 30 percent
decrease in the likelihood of observing a critical comment following the policy
implementation, and a 70 percent decrease in likelihood of observing a critical
comment about RT as a media source. While other state-funded broadcasters, like
Al Jazeera English and VOA News, received fewer critical comments after YouTube
introduced its policy; this relationship was associated with how political the
video was, rather than the policy change. Our study contributes to the ongoing
discussion on the efficacy of platform governance in relation to state-backed
media, showing that audience preferences impact the effectiveness of labels.

total revenue across two sales channels: guaranteed contracts that promise to
deliver a certain number of impressions to the advertisers, and spot demands
through an Ad Exchange. On the one hand, if a guaranteed contract is not fully
delivered, it incurs a penalty for the publisher. On the other hand, the
publisher might be able to sell an impression at a high price in the Ad
Exchange. How does a publisher maximize its total revenue as a sum of the
revenue from the Ad Exchange and the loss from the under-delivery penalty? We
study this problem parameterized by \emph{supply factor $f$}: a notion we
introduce that, intuitively, captures the number of times a publisher can
satisfy all its guaranteed contracts given its inventory supply. In this work
we present a fast simple deterministic algorithm with the optimal competitive
ratio. The algorithm and the optimal competitive ratio are a function of the
supply factor, penalty, and the distribution of the bids in the Ad Exchange.
  Beyond the yield optimization problem, classic online allocation problems
such as online bipartite matching of [Karp-Vazirani-Vazirani '90] and its
vertex-weighted variant of [Aggarwal et al. '11] can be studied in the presence
of the additional supply guaranteed by the supply factor. We show that a supply
factor of $f$ improves the approximation factors from $1-1/e$ to $f-fe^{-1/f}$.
Our approximation factor is tight and approaches $1$ as $f \to \infty$.

investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and confirm a small
discontinuity in the conduction band (0.03 eV) at the interface. The interface
defect density (Dit) values of the heterointerface with different ultra-thin

characterized based on a metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (MOSCAP) structure

interfacial layer (around 1 nm) maximizes carrier transport property due to
better surface passivation and efficient tunneling properties. Thermal property
investigation also shows that the Al2O3 UO interfacial layer offers a good
tunneling layer but also facilitates phonon transport across the interface.
Finally, the electrical characterization of Si/GaAs heterojunction p-n diodes
confirms reliable rectifying behavior with an extremely low ideality factor;
thus, heterogeneous integration using the UO approach offers a robust way to
create more types of heterojunctions between dissimilar semiconductors.

Using the parameters from an ASDEX-Upgrade plasma, a benchmark with the three
different physical models for RSAE without and with Energetic Particles (EPs)

the growth rate. Mode structure symmetry breaking (MSSB) is observed when EPs
are included, due to the EPs' non-perturbative effects. It is found that the
MSSB properties are featured by a finite radial wave phase velocity, and the
linear mode structure can be well described by an analytical complex Gaussian
expression $A(s)=e^{- \sigma (s-s_0)^2}$ with complex parameters $\sigma$ and
$s_0$, where $s$ is the normalized radial coordinate. The mode structure is
distorted in opposite {manners} when the EP drive shifted from one side of

blocks for applied quantum technology. Efficient extraction of emitted photons
and a robust spin-photon interface are crucial for the realization of quantum
sensing protocols and essential for the implementation of quantum repeaters.
Though silicon carbide (SiC) is a very promising material platform hosting
highly-coherent silicon vacancy spin qubits, a drawback for their practical
application is the unfavorable ordering of the electronic levels in the
optically excited state. Here, we demonstrate that due to polytypism of SiC, a
particular type of silicon vacancy qubits in 6H-SiC possesses an unusual
inverted fine structure. This results in the directional emission of light
along the hexagonal crystallographic axis, making photon extraction more
efficient and integration into photonic structures technologically
straightforward. From the angular polarization dependencies of the emission, we
reconstruct the spatial symmetry and determine the optical selection rules
depending on the local deformation and spin-orbit interaction, enabling direct
implementation of robust spin-photon entanglement schemes. Furthermore, the
inverted fine structure leads to unexpected behavior of the spin readout
contrast. It vanishes and recovers with lattice cooling due to two competing
optical spin pumping mechanisms. Our experimental and theoretical approaches
provide a deep insight into the optical and spin properties of atomic-scale
qubits in SiC required for quantum communication and distributed quantum

automatic tactile reflexes to govern volitional actions in situations that do

prosthesis system that reflects these concepts to aid manipulation performance
without direct vision. To implement this design, we built two fabric-based
tactile sensors that measure contact location along the palmar and dorsal sides
of the prosthetic fingers and grasp pressure at the tip of the prosthetic
thumb. Inspired by the natural sensorimotor system, we use the measurements
from these sensors to provide vibrotactile feedback of contact location and
implement a tactile grasp controller that uses automatic reflexes to prevent
over-grasping and object slip. We compare this system to a standard myoelectric
prosthesis in a challenging reach-to-pick-and-place task conducted without
direct vision; 17 able-bodied adults took part in this single-session
between-subjects study. Participants in the tactile group achieved more
consistent high performance compared to participants in the standard group.
These results indicate that the addition of contact-location feedback and

propose a physics-based approach to simulate lidar point clouds of scenes in
adverse weather conditions. These augmented datasets can then be used to train
lidar-based detectors to improve their all-weather reliability. Specifically,
we introduce a hybrid Monte-Carlo based approach that treats (i) the effects of

calculation of scattering efficiencies from the Mie theory and particle size

gyrosynchrotron emission. While both auroral and gyrosynchrotron emission peak

decade have provided new tools to observe the image regions that are most
informative for classification and localization in artificial neural networks

data from 79 new experiments and 7,810 participants, we show that passive
attention techniques reveal a significant overlap with human visual selectivity
estimates derived from 6 distinct behavioral tasks including visual
discrimination, spatial localization, recognizability, free-viewing,
cued-object search, and saliency search fixations. We find that input
visualizations derived from relatively simple ANN architectures probed using
guided backpropagation methods are the best predictors of a shared component in
the joint variability of the human measures. We validate these correlational
results with causal manipulations using recognition experiments. We show that
images masked with ANN attention maps were easier for humans to classify than
control masks in a speeded recognition experiment. Similarly, we find that
recognition performance in the same ANN models was likewise influenced by
masking input images using human visual selectivity maps. This work contributes
a new approach to evaluating the biological and psychological validity of
leading ANNs as models of human vision: by examining their similarities and
differences in terms of their visual selectivity to the information contained

deep neural networks to support probabilistic deep learning through the use of
probabilistic layers that, traditionally, encode weight (and bias) uncertainty.
In particular, hybrid Bayesian neural networks utilize standard deterministic
layers together with few probabilistic layers judicially positioned in the
networks for uncertainty estimation. A major aspect and benefit of Bayesian
inference is that priors, in principle, provide the means to encode prior
knowledge for use in inference and prediction. However, it is difficult to
specify priors on weights since the weights have no intuitive interpretation.
Further, the relationships of priors on weights to the functions computed by
networks are difficult to characterize. In contrast, functions are intuitive to
interpret and are direct since they map inputs to outputs. Therefore, it is
natural to specify priors on functions to encode prior knowledge, and to use
them in inference and prediction based on functions. To support this, we
propose hybrid Bayesian neural networks with functional probabilistic layers
that encode function (and activation) uncertainty. We discuss their foundations
in functional Bayesian inference, functional variational inference, sparse
Gaussian processes, and sparse variational Gaussian processes. We further
perform few proof-of-concept experiments using GPflus, a new library that
provides Gaussian process layers and supports their use with deterministic
Keras layers to form hybrid neural network and Gaussian process models.

promising, their dynamic phenomenology with current, skyrmion size, geometric

dynamics of individual skyrmions forming dense arrays in Pt/Co/MgO wires by

increases weakly with skyrmion size. Particle model simulations suggest that
the SkHE size dependence - contrary to analytical predictions - arises from the

regime switching and paths dependence. The key novel feature of the developed
process lies on its ability to switch the transition rate as it moves from one
state to another with switching probability depending on the current state and
time of the process as well as its past trajectories. As such, the transition
from current state to another depends on the holding time of the process in the
state. Distributional properties of the process are given explicitly in terms
of the speed regimes represented by a finite number of different transition
matrices, the probabilities of selecting regime membership within each state,
and past realization of the process. In particular, it has distributional
equivalent stochastic representation with a general mixture of Markov jump
processes introduced in Frydman and Surya (2020). Maximum likelihood estimates
(MLE) of the distribution parameters of the process are derived in closed form.
The estimation is done iteratively using the EM algorithm. Akaike information
criterion is used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the selected model. An
explicit observed Fisher information matrix of the MLE is derived for the
calculation of standard errors of the MLE. The information matrix takes on a
simplified form of the general matrix formula of Louis (1982). Large sample
properties of the MLE are presented. In particular, the covariance matrix for
the MLE of transition rates is equal to the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound, and is
less for the MLE of regime membership. The simulation study confirms these
findings and shows that the parameter estimates are accurate, consistent, and
have asymptotic normality as the sample size increases.

attractive targets for exploring their atmospheres and formation processes.
Recent studies suggested that the large radii of super-puffs may be caused by
atmospheric dust entrained in the escaping atmospheres. In this study, we
investigate how the dust grows in escaping atmospheres and influence the
transit radii using a microphysical model of grain growth. Collision growth is
efficient in many cases, leading to hinder the upward transport of dust via
enhanced gravitational settling. We find that dust abundance in the outflow
hardly exceeds the Mach number at the dust production region. Thus, dust formed
at upper atmospheres, say $P\lesssim{10}^{-5}$ bar, are needed to launch a
dusty outflow with high dust abundance. With sufficiently high dust production
altitudes and rates, the dusty outflow can enhance the observable radius by a
factor of $\sim$2 or even more. We suggest that photochemical haze is a
promising candidate of high-altitude dust that can be entrained in the outflow.
We also compute the synthetic transmission spectra of super-puff atmospheres
and demonstrate that the dusty outflow produces a broad spectral slope and
obscures molecular features, in agreement with recently reported featureless
spectra. Lastly, using an interior structure model, we suggest that the
atmospheric dust could drastically enhance the observable radius only for
planets in a narrow mass range of $\sim2$--$5M_{\rm \oplus}$, in which the
boil-off tends to cause total atmospheric loss. This may explain why
super-puffs are uncommon despite the suggested universality of photochemical
hazes.

with sparse extrinsic rewards. A possible countermeasure is to endow RL agents
with an intrinsic reward function, or 'intrinsic motivation', which rewards the
agent based on certain features of the current sensor state. An intrinsic
reward function based on the principle of empowerment assigns rewards
proportional to the amount of control the agent has over its own sensors. We
implemented a variation on a recently proposed intrinsically motivated agent,
which we refer to as the 'curious' agent, and an empowerment-inspired agent.
The former leverages sensor state encoding with a variational autoencoder,
while the latter predicts the next sensor state via a variational information
bottleneck. We compared the performance of both agents to that of an advantage
actor-critic baseline in four sparse reward grid worlds. Both the empowerment
agent and its curious competitor seem to benefit to similar extents from their
intrinsic rewards. This provides some experimental support to the conjecture
that empowerment can be used to drive exploration.

these works usually hold two assumptions, which prevent them from being
smoothly applied to robot applications: (1) positions of all pedestrians are
consistently tracked, and (2) the target agent pays attention to all
pedestrians in the scene. The first assumption leads to biased interaction
modeling with incomplete pedestrian data. The second assumption introduces
aggregation of redundant surrounding information, and the target agent may be
affected by unimportant neighbors or present overly conservative motion. Thus,
we propose Gumbel Social Transformer, in which an Edge Gumbel Selector samples
a sparse interaction graph of partially detected pedestrians at each time step.

In the classification model, CNN is responsible for spatial feature extraction

identify intentions of users. When conducting imagined speech, the users
imagine the pronunciation as if actually speaking. In contrast, overt speech is
a task in which the users directly pronounce the words. When controlling drone
swarms using imagined speech, complex commands can be delivered more
intuitively, but decoding performance is lower than that of other endogenous
BCI paradigms. We proposed the Deep-autoleaner (DAL) to learn EEG features of
overt speech for imagined speech-based EEG signals classification. To the best
of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to use EEG features of overt
speech to decode imagined speech-based EEG signals with an autoencoder. A total

companies and improve the service quality. Existing methods use exact or
heuristic algorithms to optimize the timetable in an offline manner. In
practice, the passenger flow may change significantly over time. Timetables
determined in offline cannot adjust the departure interval to satisfy the
changed passenger flow. Aiming at improving the online performance of bus
timetable, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning based bus Timetable dynamic
Optimization method (DRL-TO). In this method, the timetable optimization is
considered as a sequential decision problem. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) is employed
as the decision model to determine whether to dispatch a bus service during
each minute of the service period. Therefore, the departure intervals of bus
services are determined in real time in accordance with passenger demand. We
identify several new and useful state features for the DQN, including the load
factor, carrying capacity utilization rate, and the number of stranding
passengers. Taking into account both the interests of the bus company and
passengers, a reward function is designed, which includes the indicators of
full load rate, empty load rate, passengers' waiting time, and the number of
stranding passengers. Building on an existing method for calculating the
carrying capacity, we develop a new technique to enhance the matching degree at
each bus station. Experiments demonstrate that compared with the timetable
generated by the state-of-the-art bus timetable optimization approach based on
a memetic algorithm (BTOA-MA), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the manual method,
DRL-TO can dynamically determine the departure intervals based on the real-time

and they arise from some oceanic model. From the mathematical point of view,
they write down as the well-know Navier-Stokes equations with an additional
nonlocal operator in their nonlinear transport term, and moreover, with an
additional damping term depending of a parameter $\beta>0$. We study first the
existence and uniqueness of global in time weak solutions in the energy space.
Thereafter, our main objective is to describe the long time behavior of these
solutions. For this, we use some tools in the theory of dynamical systems to
prove the existence of a global attractor, which is a compact subset in the
energy space attracting all the weak solutions when the time goes to infinity.
Moreover, we derive an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the global
attractor associated to these equations.
  Finally, we find a range of values for the damping parameter $\beta>0$, where
we are able to give an acutely description of the internal structure of the
global attractor. More precisely, we prove that the global attractor only
contains the stationary (time-independing) solution of the damped

the striking observation that, in standard vision datasets, simple scores

efficacy on a range of architectures and datasets by pruning significant

EL2N scores calculated a few epochs into training, we can prune half of the
CIFAR10 training set while slightly improving test accuracy. Furthermore, for a
given dataset, EL2N scores from one architecture or hyperparameter
configuration generalize to other configurations. Compared to recent work that
prunes data by discarding examples that are rarely forgotten over the course of
training, our scores use only local information early in training. We also use
our scores to detect noisy examples and study training dynamics through the
lens of important examples -- we investigate how the data distribution shapes

follows, the threshold energy of the quasi-bounded Feshbach molecule acts as
the knife of cooling, expelling the scattering atoms with selected kinetic

established near an equilibrium state. The vanishing of viscosity is the main
challenge compared with our previous work [47] where the viscosity coefficients
are included and the decay rates for the highest-order derivatives of the
solutions seem not optimal. One of the main objectives of this paper is to
develop some new dissipative estimates such that the smallness of the initial
data and decay rates are independent of the viscosity. In addition, it proves
that the decay rates for the highest-order derivatives of the solutions are
optimal. Our proof relies on Fourier theory and delicate energy method. This
work can be viewed as an extension of [47].

convection-dominated diffusion problems. There are two main ingredients in our
approach. First, we define the norm on the test space as induced by the trial
space norm, i.e., the optimal test norm, so that the inf-sup condition can be
satisfied uniformly independent of the problem. We show the well-posedness of a
class of nonlocal convection-dominated diffusion problems under the optimal
test norm with general assumptions on the nonlocal diffusion and convection
kernels. Second, following the framework of Cohen et al.~(2012), we embed the
original nonlocal convection-dominated diffusion problem into a larger mixed
problem so as to choose an enriched test space as a stabilization of the
numerical algorithm. In the numerical experiments, we use an approximate
optimal test norm which can be efficiently implemented in 1d, and study its
performance against the energy norm on the test space. We conduct convergence
studies for the nonlocal problem using uniform $h$- and $p$-refinements, and
adaptive $h$-refinements on both smooth manufactured solutions and solutions
with sharp gradient in a transition layer. In addition, we confirm that the PG
method is asymptotically compatible.

phase change materials, such as the germanium-antimony-tellurium alloys and
post transition metal oxides, such as ITO, have been used to tune optical
antennas in the near infrared spectrum, tunable dielectric antennae in the
visible spectrum remain to be demonstrated. In this paper, we designed and
experimentally demonstrated tunable dielectric nanoantenna arrays with Mie
resonances in the visible spectrum, exploiting phase transitions in
wide-bandgap Sb2S3 nano-resonators. In the amorphous state, Mie resonances in
these Sb2S3 nanostructures give rise to a strong structural color in reflection
mode. Thermal annealing induced crystallization and laser induced amorphization
of the Sb2S3 resonators allow the color to be tuned reversibly. We believe
these tunable Sb2S3 nanoantennae arrays will enable a wide variety of tunable
nanophotonic applications, such as high-resolution color displays, holographic

choose their representatives. The most common mechanism in the United States --
Winner takes all single-member districts -- both enables substantial partisan
gerrymandering and constrains `fair' redistricting, preventing proportional
representation in legislatures. We study the design of multi-member districts
(MMDs), in which each district elects multiple representatives, potentially
through a non-Winner takes all voting rule. We carry out large-scale empirical
analyses for the U.S. House of Representatives under MMDs with different social
choice functions, under algorithmically generated maps optimized for either
partisan benefit or proportionality. Doing so requires efficiently
incorporating predicted partisan outcomes -- under various multi-winner social
choice functions -- into an algorithm that optimizes over an ensemble of maps.
We find that with three-member districts using Single Transferable Vote,
fairness-minded independent commissions would be able to achieve proportional
outcomes in every state up to rounding, and advantage-seeking partisans would
have their power to gerrymander significantly curtailed. Simultaneously, such
districts would preserve geographic cohesion, an arguably important aspect of
representative democracies. In the process, we advance a rich research agenda
at the intersection of social choice and computational gerrymandering.

without the $q^2$ extrapolation to the zero momentum point. These results are
compared with the ones determined by the standard method, where the $q^2$
extrapolations of the corresponding form factors are carried out by fitting

obtained with a larger statistical error than the standard method, but with a
smaller systematic error associated with the data analysis. Within the total
error range of the statistical and systematic errors combined, the two results

derivative of the induced pseudoscalar form factor at the zero momentum point
show some discrepancy. It seems to be caused by a finite volume effect, since a
similar trend is not observed on a large volume, but seen on a small volume in

deeper understanding of many interventions, policies, or medications, yet
researchers are often left with observational studies for doing so. In the
observational setting, confounding is a barrier to the estimation of causal
effects. Weighting approaches seek to control for confounding by reweighting
samples so that confounders are comparable across different treatment values.
Yet, for continuous treatments, weighting methods are highly sensitive to model
misspecification. In this paper we elucidate the key property that makes
weights effective in estimating causal quantities involving continuous
treatments. We show that to eliminate confounding, weights should make
treatment and confounders independent on the weighted scale. We develop a
measure that characterizes the degree to which a set of weights induces such
independence. Further, we propose a new model-free method for weight estimation
by optimizing our measure. We study the theoretical properties of our measure

treatment-confounder dependence. The empirical effectiveness of our approach is
demonstrated in a suite of challenging numerical experiments, where we find
that our weights are quite robust and work well under a broad range of

we use our recently developed Clapeyron integration technique to compute

notion of shake slice knots to links. There is also a relative version, shake
concordance, that generalizes link concordance. We show that if two links are
shake concordant, then their zero surgery manifolds are homology cobordant.
Then we give several obstructions to a link being shake slice; for instance,
the Arf invariants vanish for both the link and each component. Finally we show

integral field spectroscopy from the WiFeS spectrograph. In addition to the
majority $\sim 13\,\rm Gyr$ old stellar population, ESO 422-G028 exhibits a
much younger ($\lesssim 10\,\rm Myr$ old) component with an estimated mass of $
10^{7.6}\,\rm M_\odot$ which is predominantly located in the North-West region
of the galaxy. Unusually, the ionised gas kinematics reveal two distinct disks
traced by narrow ($\sigma_{\rm H\alpha} < 100 \,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) and broad
($\sigma_{\rm H\alpha} > 150 \,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) H$\alpha$ emission
respectively. Both ionised gas disks are misaligned with the axis of stellar
rotation, suggesting an external origin. This is consistent with the prominent
interstellar Na D absorption, which traces a $1 - 3 \,\rm M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$
inflow of neutral gas from the North. We posit that an inflow of gas - either
from an accretion event or a gas-rich merger - has triggered both the starburst

L1-PCA has shown great promise in alleviating the effect of outliers in data
analytic applications. However, it gives rise to a challenging non-smooth
non-convex optimization problem, for which existing algorithms are either not
scalable or lack strong theoretical guarantees on their convergence behavior.
In this paper, we propose a proximal alternating minimization method with

problem. We then show that for both the L1-PCA problem and its two-block
reformulation, the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz exponent at any of the limiting
critical points is $1/2$. This allows us to establish the linear convergence of
the sequence of iterates generated by PAMe and to determine the criticality of
the limit of the sequence with respect to both the L1-PCA problem and its
two-block reformulation. To complement our theoretical development, we show via
numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets that PAMe is
competitive with a host of existing methods. Our results not only significantly
advance the convergence theory of iterative methods for L1-PCA but also
demonstrate the potential of our proposed method in applications.

models in real-world scenarios. In order to improve model performance on noisy

However, in most cases there are only labelled clean texts. Since there is no
handwritten pictures corresponding to the text, it is impossible to directly
use the recognition model to obtain noisy labelled data. Human resources can be
employed to copy texts and take pictures, but it is extremely expensive
considering the size of data for model training. Consequently, we are

$\dot\omega^\mathrm{LT,\,A}$ induced by the spin angular momentum
${\boldsymbol{S}}^\mathrm{A}$ of A valid if the orbital angular momentum
$\boldsymbol{L}$ and ${\boldsymbol{S}}^\mathrm{A}$ are aligned, and neglecting
$\dot\omega^\mathrm{LT,\,B}$ because of the smallness of
${\boldsymbol{S}}^\mathrm{B}$. The impact on $\dot\omega^\mathrm{LT,\,A}$ of
the departures of the ${\boldsymbol{S}}^\mathrm{A}$-$\boldsymbol{L}$ geometry
from the ideal alignment is calculated. With the current upper bound on the
misalignment angle $\delta_\mathrm{A}$ between them, the angles
$\lambda_\mathrm{A},\,\eta_\mathrm{A}$ of ${\boldsymbol{S}}^\mathrm{A}$ are
constrained within $85^\circ \lesssim \lambda_\mathrm{A}\lesssim 92^\circ,\,
266^\circ \lesssim \eta_\mathrm{A} \lesssim 274^\circ$. In units of
$\dot\omega^\mathrm{GR}=16.89^\circ\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, a range variation as
little as
$\Delta\dot\omega^\mathrm{LT,\,A}\doteq\dot\omega^\mathrm{LT,\,A}_\mathrm{max}
- \dot\omega^\mathrm{LT,\,A}_\mathrm{min} = 8\times
10^{-8}\,\omega^\mathrm{GR}$ is implied. The experimental uncertainty
$\sigma_{\dot\omega_\mathrm{obs}}$ in measuring the periastron rate with the
SKA 1-mid telescope should become smaller by 2028-2030. Then, the spatial
orientation of ${\boldsymbol{S}}^\mathrm{B}$ is constrained from the existing
bounds on the misalignment angle $\delta_\mathrm{B}$, and
$\dot\omega^\mathrm{LT,\,B}\simeq 2\times 10^{-7}\,\dot\omega^\mathrm{GR}$ is
correspondingly calculated. The error $\sigma_{\dot\omega_\mathrm{obs}}$ should
become smaller at the transition from MeerKAT+ facility to SKA 1-mid around
2025. (Abridged)

video chunk without compromising user experience. NeuSaver generates an optimal
policy that determines the appropriate frame rate for each video chunk using
reinforcement learning (RL). The RL model automatically learns the policy that
maximizes the QoE goals based on previous observations. NeuSaver also uses an
asynchronous advantage actor-critic algorithm to reinforce the RL model quickly

segments with various frame rates, which is similar to the process of creating
videos with multiple bit rates in dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP.
NeuSaver utilizes the commonly used H.264 video codec. We evaluated NeuSaver in

view into complex developmental processes. Still, little is known on how the
complexity of multicellular organisms evolved by elaborating developmental
programs and inventing new cell types. A hurdle to understanding developmental
evolution is the difficulty of even describing the intertwined network of
spatiotemporal processes underlying the development of complex multicellular
organisms. Nonetheless, an overview of developmental trajectories can be
obtained from cell type lineage maps. Here, we propose that these lineage maps
can also reveal how developmental programs evolve: the modes of evolving new
cell types in an organism should be visible in its developmental trajectories,
and therefore in the geometry of its cell type lineage map. This idea is
demonstrated using a parsimonious generative model of developmental programs,
which allows us to reliably survey the universe of all possible programs and
examine their topological features. We find that, contrary to belief, tree-like
lineage maps are rare and lineage maps of complex multicellular organisms are
likely to be directed acyclic graphs where multiple developmental routes can
converge on the same cell type. While cell type evolution prescribes what
developmental programs come into existence, natural selection prunes those
programs which produce low-functioning organisms. Our model indicates that
additionally, lineage map topologies are correlated with such a functional
property: the ability of organisms to regenerate.

vector and a feasibility polytope -- but has a distinctly combinatorial flavor.
To solve this complex problem, we also contribute MISSLE, an algorithm for
learning MILPs from contextual examples. MISSLE uses a variant of stochastic
local search that is guided by the gradient of a continuous surrogate loss
function. Our empirical evaluation on synthetic data shows that MISSLE acquires
better MILPs faster than alternatives based on stochastic local search and
gradient descent.

work presents a high efficiency configuration for ocean wave energy powering
batch reverse osmosis. The proposed system uses seawater as the working fluid
in a hydro-mechanical wave energy converter and replaces the reverse osmosis
high-pressure pump with a hydraulic converter for direct-drive coupling. This
allows for minimal intermediary power conversions, fewer components, and higher
efficiencies. The concept was analyzed with MATLAB to model the transient
energy dynamics of the wave energy converter, power take-off system, and
desalination load. The fully hydro-mechanical coupling, incorporating energy
recovery, could achieve an SEC and LCOW as low as 2.30 kWh/m3 and $1.96,
respectively, for different sea states. The results were validated at the
sub-system level against existing literature on wave energy models and previous
work completed on batch reverse osmosis models, as this system was the first to
combine these two technologies. SEC and LCOW values were validated by comparing
to known and predicted values for various types of RO systems.

and find that they are clustered in the longitude of perihelion $\varpi$,
around the locations $\varpi_{\mbox{{J}}}+60^{\circ}$ and
$\varpi_{\mbox{{J}}}-60^{\circ}$ ($\varpi_{\mbox{{J}}}$ is the longitude of

aligned islands of libration centered on
$\Delta\varpi=\varpi-\varpi_{\mbox{{J}}}\approx\pm60^{\circ}$, for the
Trojan-like orbits with eccentricities $e<0.1$. Through a detailed analysis, we
have shown that the observed Jupiter Trojans with proper eccentricities
$e_p<0.1$ spend most of their time in the range of
$|\Delta\varpi|=0-120^{\circ}$, while the more eccentric ones with $e_p>0.1$
are too few to affect the orbital clustering within this $\Delta\varpi$ range

even starting from a uniform $\Delta\varpi$ distribution, the apsidal alignment
of simulated Trojans similar to the observation can appear on the order of the

results for the information projection in the infinite-dimensional setting for

specification of the moment inequality model, nesting both conditional and
unconditional models, and allowing for an infinite number of such inequalities.
An essential innovation of the paper is the exhibition of the dual variable as
a weak vector-valued integral to formulate an approximation scheme of the
$I$-projection's equivalent Fenchel dual problem. In particular, it is shown
under suitable assumptions that the dual problem's optimum value can be
approximated by the values of finite-dimensional programs and that, in
addition, every accumulation point of a sequence of optimal solutions for the
approximating programs is an optimal solution for the dual problem. This paper
illustrates the verification of assumptions and the construction of the
approximation scheme's parameters for the cases of unconditional and
conditional first-order stochastic dominance constraints and dominance
conditions that characterize selectionable distributions for a random set. The
paper also includes numerical experiments based on these examples that
demonstrate the simplicity of the approximation scheme in practice and its
straightforward implementation using off-the-shelf optimization methods.

  Multi-dimensional, heavy-tailed-based modelling","12 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables",,,,"q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mining companies to properly manage their operations and be ready to make
business decisions, are required to analyze potential scenarios for main market
risk factors. The most important risk factors for KGHM, one of the biggest
companies active in the metals and mining industry, are the price of copper
(Cu), traded in US dollars, and the Polish zloty (PLN) exchange rate (USDPLN).
The main scope of the paper is to understand the mid- and long-term dynamics of
these two risk factors. For a mining company it might help to properly evaluate
potential downside market risk and optimise hedging instruments. From the
market risk management perspective, it is also important to analyze the
dynamics of these two factors combined with the price of copper in Polish zloty
(Cu in PLN), which jointly drive the revenues, cash flows, and financial
results of the company. Based on the relation between analyzed risk factors and
distribution analysis, we propose to use two-dimensional vector autoregressive
(VAR) model with the $\alpha-$stable distribution. The non-homogeneity of the
data is reflected in two identified regimes: first - corresponding to the 2008
crisis and second - to the stable market situation. As a natural implication of
the model fitted to market assets, we derive the dynamics of the copper price
in PLN, which is not a traded asset but is crucial for the KGHM company risk
exposure. A comparative study is performed to demonstrate the effect of
including dependencies of the assets and the implications of the regime change.
Since for various international companies, risk factors are given rather in the
national than the market currency, the approach is universal and can be used in
different market contexts, like mining or oil companies, but also other
commodities involved in the global trading system.

populations of the present-day quenched and bulge-dominated galaxies (both
being dynamically cold and hot) used to have significantly higher
star-formation rates and flatter morphologies at redshift of $z\sim 2$. They
have experienced more frequent larger mass-ratio mergers below $z \sim 0.7$ in

differences on the cold and hot dynamical status among these galaxies. We point
out that the real-world counterparts of these dynamically cold and hot

While several works have been proposed for relation modeling in the image
domain, there have been many constraints in the video domain due to challenging
dynamics of spatio-temporal interactions (e.g., between which objects are there
an interaction? when do relations start and end?). To date, two representative
methods have been proposed to tackle Video Visual Relation Detection (VidVRD):
segment-based and window-based. We first point out limitations of these methods
and propose a novel approach named Temporal Span Proposal Network (TSPN). TSPN
tells what to look: it sparsifies relation search space by scoring relationness
of object pair, i.e., measuring how probable a relation exist. TSPN tells when
to look: it simultaneously predicts start-end timestamps (i.e., temporal spans)
and categories of the all possible relations by utilizing full video context.
These two designs enable a win-win scenario: it accelerates training by 2X or
more than existing methods and achieves competitive performance on two VidVRD
benchmarks (ImageNet-VidVDR and VidOR). Moreover, comprehensive ablative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Codes are available

by placing a constraint $P(w)\leq t$ on the values of the parameters $w$.
Although efficient methods exist for finding solutions to these constrained

Applications involving sparsity inducing regularization of arbitrary Neural

various polymorph phases and rich structure-property relationships. BaRuO3

properties are significantly modified depending on its atomic structure.
Whereas thin-film epitaxy would vastly expand the application of hexagonal
perovskites by epitaxially stabilizing various metastable polymorphs, the
atomic structure of epitaxial hexagonal perovskites, especially at the initial
growth stage, has rarely been investigated. In this study, we show that an
intriguing nucleation behavior takes place during the initial stabilization of
a hexagonal perovskite 9R BaRuO3 (BRO) thin film on a (111) SrTiO3 (STO)
substrate. We use high-resolution high-angle annular dark field scanning
transmission electron microscopy in combination with geometrical phase analysis
to understand the local strain relaxation behavior. We find that nano-scale
strained layers, composed of different RuO6 octahedral stacking, are initially
formed at the interface, followed by a relaxed single crystal9R BRO thin film.
Within the interface layer, hexagonal BROs are nucleated on the STO (111)
substrate by both corner- and face-sharing. More interestingly, we find that
the boundaries between the differently-stacked nucleation layers, i.e.
heterostructural boundaries facilitates strain relaxation, in addition to the
formation of conventional misfit dislocations evolving from homostructural
boundaries. Our observations reveal an important underlying mechanism to
understand the thin-film epitaxy and strain accommodation in hexagonal

data are provided to a central server for model training. In many applications,
however, data are inherently fragmented. Such a decentralized nature of these
databases presents the biggest challenge for collaboration: sending all
decentralized datasets to a central server raises serious privacy concerns.
Although there has been a joint effort in tackling such a critical issue by
proposing privacy-preserving machine learning frameworks, such as federated
learning, most state-of-the-art frameworks are built still in a centralized
way, in which a central client is needed for collecting and distributing model
information (instead of data itself) from every other client, leading to high
communication pressure and high vulnerability when there exists a failure at or
attack on the central client. Here we propose a principled decentralized
federated learning algorithm (DeceFL), which does not require a central client
and relies only on local information transmission between clients and their
neighbors, representing a fully decentralized learning framework. It has been
further proven that every client reaches the global minimum with zero
performance gap and achieves the same convergence rate $O(1/T)$ (where $T$ is
the number of iterations in gradient descent) as centralized federated learning
when the loss function is smooth and strongly convex. Finally, the proposed
algorithm has been applied to a number of applications to illustrate its
effectiveness for both convex and nonconvex loss functions, demonstrating its
applicability to a wide range of real-world medical and industrial
applications.

$\alpha$, and the fractal Burgers equation of order $\beta$, where $\alpha,
\beta \in [0,1)$, and the Whitham equation. For all $\alpha, \beta \in [0,1)$,
we construct solutions whose gradient blows up at a point, and whose amplitude
stays bounded, which therefore display a ""shock-like"" singularity. We moreover
provide an asymptotic description of the blow-up. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first proof of gradient blow-up for the fKdV equation in the
range $\alpha \in [2/3, 1)$, as well as the first description of explicit
blow-up dynamics for the fractal Burgers equation in the range $\beta \in [2/3,
1)$.
  Our construction is based on modulation theory, where the well-known smooth
self-similar solutions to the inviscid Burgers equation are used as profiles. A
somewhat amusing point is that the profiles that are less stable under initial
data perturbations (in that the number of unstable directions is larger) are
more stable under perturbations of the equation (in that higher order
dispersive and/or dissipative terms are allowed) due to their slower rates of
concentration. Another innovation of this article, which may be of independent
interest, is the development of a streamlined weighted $L^{2}$-based approach
(in lieu of the characteristic method) for establishing the sharp spatial
behavior of the solution in self-similar variables, which leads to the sharp
H\""older regularity of the solution up to the blow-up time.

larger and deeper network architecture, which, however, often brings high
network latency when generating online recommendations. Naturally, we argue
that compressing the heavy recommendation models into middle- or light- weight
neural networks is of great importance for practical production systems. To
realize such a goal, we propose AdaRec, a knowledge distillation (KD) framework
which compresses knowledge of a teacher model into a student model adaptively
according to its recommendation scene by using differentiable Neural
Architecture Search (NAS). Specifically, we introduce a target-oriented
distillation loss to guide the structure search process for finding the student
network architecture, and a cost-sensitive loss as constraints for model size,
which achieves a superior trade-off between recommendation effectiveness and
efficiency. In addition, we leverage Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to realize
many-to-many layer mapping during knowledge distillation, which enables each
intermediate student layer to learn from other intermediate teacher layers
adaptively. Extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets
demonstrate that our model achieves competitive or better accuracy with notable
inference speedup comparing to strong counterparts, while discovering diverse
neural architectures for sequential recommender models under different
recommendation scenes.

expectation-valued function, denoted by $f$ and defined as $f(x)\triangleq
\mathbb{E}[\tilde{f}(x,\omega)]$, over a Cartesian product of closed and convex
sets with a view towards obtaining both asymptotics as well as rate and
complexity guarantees for computing an approximate stationary point (in a
Clarke sense). We adopt a smoothing-based approach reliant on minimizing
$f_{\eta}$ where $f_{\eta}(x) \triangleq \mathbb{E}_{u}[f(x+\eta u)]$, $u$ is a
random variable defined on a unit sphere, and $\eta > 0$. In fact, it is
observed that a stationary point of the $\eta$-smoothed problem is a
$2\eta$-stationary point for the original problem in the Clarke sense. In such
a setting, we derive a suitable residual function that provides a metric for
stationarity for the smoothed problem. By leveraging a zeroth-order framework
reliant on utilizing sampled function evaluations implemented in a
block-structured regime, we make two sets of contributions for the sequence
generated by the proposed scheme. (i) The residual function of the smoothed
problem tends to zero almost surely along the generated sequence; (ii) To
compute an $x$ that ensures that the expected norm of the residual of the
$\eta$-smoothed problem is within $\epsilon$ requires no greater than
$\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\eta \epsilon^2})$ projection steps and
$\mathcal{O}\left(\tfrac{1}{\eta^2 \epsilon^4}\right)$ function evaluations.
These statements appear to be novel and there appear to be few results to
contend with general nonsmooth, nonconvex, and stochastic regimes via
zeroth-order approaches.

minimum clique cover algorithm, which identifies the global optimal solution.
Finally, a distributed control framework and communication topology are

function maximization has led to tight results for a simple cardinality
constraint. However, current techniques fail to give a similar understanding
for natural generalizations, including matroid constraints. This paper aims at
closing this gap. For a single matroid of rank $k$ (i.e., any solution has
cardinality at most $k$), our main results are: 1) a single-pass streaming
algorithm that uses $\widetilde{O}(k)$ memory and achieves an approximation
guarantee of $0.3178$, and 2) a multi-pass streaming algorithm that uses
$\widetilde{O}(k)$ memory and achieves an approximation guarantee of $(1-1/e -
\varepsilon)$ by taking a constant (depending on $\varepsilon$) number of
passes over the stream. This improves on the previously best approximation
guarantees of $1/4$ and $1/2$ for single-pass and multi-pass streaming
algorithms, respectively. In fact, our multi-pass streaming algorithm is tight
in that any algorithm with a better guarantee than $1/2$ must make several
passes through the stream and any algorithm that beats our guarantee of $1-1/e$
must make linearly many passes (as well as an exponential number of value
oracle queries).
  Moreover, we show how the approach we use for multi-pass streaming can be
further strengthened if the elements of the stream arrive in uniformly random
order, implying an improved result for $p$-matchoid constraints.

this problem setting, the reward function can be obtained automatically by
training a classifier to categorize states as successful or not. If trained

both promotes progress toward good states and provides a calibrated exploration
bonus. In this work, we show that an uncertainty aware classifier can solve
challenging reinforcement learning problems by both encouraging exploration and
provided directed guidance towards positive outcomes. We propose a novel

reparameterize the network weights and the powerful fitting ability of deep

enabler to improve the coverage of the signals and mitigate the frequent
blockages in millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
communications. However, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition is one
of the major challenges for the practical deployment of the RIS. The passive
RIS without any baseband processing capabilities brings difficulty on the
channel estimation (CE), since the individual channels or the cascaded one can
be estimated only at base station (BS) via uplink training or mobile station
(MS) via downlink training. In order to facilitate the CSI acquisition, we
focus on the hybrid RIS architecture, where a small number of elements are
active and able to receive and process the pilot signals at the RIS. The CE is
performed in two stages by following the atomic norm minimization to recover
the channel parameters, i.e., angles of departure (AoDs), angles of arrival
(AoAs), and propagation path gains. Simulation results show that the proposed
scheme can outperform the passive RIS CE under the same training overhead.
Furthermore, we also study the theoretical performance limits in terms of mean
square error (MSE) via Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analyses.

evolving industrial requirements. This paper, for the first time, proposes an
event-based robotic grasping framework for multiple known and unknown objects
in a cluttered scene. Compared with standard frame-based vision, neuromorphic
vision has advantages of microsecond-level sampling rate and no motion blur.
Building on that, the model-based and model-free approaches are developed for
known and unknown objects' grasping respectively. For the model-based approach,
event-based multi-view approach is used to localize the objects in the scene,
and then point cloud processing allows for the clustering and registering of
objects. Differently, the proposed model-free approach utilizes the developed
event-based object segmentation, visual servoing and grasp planning to
localize, align to, and grasp the targeting object. The proposed approaches are
experimentally validated with objects of different sizes, using a UR10 robot
with an eye-in-hand neuromorphic camera and a Barrett hand gripper. Moreover,
the robustness of the two proposed event-based grasping approaches are
validated in a low-light environment. This low-light operating ability shows a
great advantage over the grasping using the standard frame-based vision.
Furthermore, the developed model-free approach demonstrates the advantage of
dealing with unknown object without prior knowledge compared to the proposed

Specifically, our NvEM utilizes a subject module and a reference module to
collect contexts from neighbor views. The subject module fuses neighbor views
at a global level, and the reference module fuses neighbor objects at a local
level. Subjects and references are adaptively determined via attention
me'chanisms. Our model also includes an action module to utilize the strong
orientation guidance (e.g., ""turn left"") in instructions. Each module predicts
navigation action separately and their weighted sum is used for predicting the
final action. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method on the R2R and R4R benchmarks against several

technical debt, and thus poor maintainability. Duplicated code is one important
example of such technical debt. In fact, we observed that the amount of
duplication in the OutSystems VPL code bases can reach as high as $39\%$.
  Duplicated code detection in text-based programming languages is still an
active area of research with important implications regarding software
maintainability and evolution. However, to the best of our knowledge, the
literature on duplicated code detection for VPLs is very limited. We propose a
novel and scalable duplicated code pattern mining algorithm that leverages the
visual structure of VPLs in order to not only detect duplicated code, but also
highlight duplicated code patterns that explain the reported duplication. The
performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on a wide range of real-world
mobile and web applications developed using OutSystems.

oscillations at the surface. It suffers from systematic errors, such as a
center-to-limb error in travel-time measurements. Understanding these errors
requires a good understanding of the nontrivial relationship between wave
displacement and helioseismic observables. The wave displacement causes
perturbations in the atmospheric thermodynamical quantities which perturb the
opacity, the optical depth, the source function, and the local ray geometry,
thus affecting the emergent intensity. We aim to establish the most complete
relationship up to now between the displacement and the intensity perturbation
by solving the radiative transfer problem in the atmosphere. We derive an
expression for the intensity perturbation caused by acoustic oscillations at
any point on the solar disk by applying the first-order perturbation theory. As
input, we consider adiabatic modes of oscillation of different degrees. The
background and the perturbed intensities are computed considering the main
sources of opacity in the continuum. We find that, for all modes, the
perturbations to the thermodynamical quantities are not sufficient to model the
intensity. In addition, the geometrical effects due to the displacement must be
taken into account as they lead to a difference in amplitude and a phase shift
between the temperature at the surface and intensity perturbations. The closer
to the limb, the larger the differences. This work presents improvements for
the computation of the intensity perturbations, in particular for high-degree
modes, and explains differences in intensity computations in earlier works. The
phase shifts and amplitude differences between the temperature and intensity
perturbations increase towards the limb. This should help to interpret some of
the systematic center-to-limb effects observed in local helioseismology.

embed our training videos in the StyleGAN latent space. Our temporal
architecture is then trained not on sequences of RGB frames, but on sequences
of StyleGAN latent codes. The advantageous properties of the StyleGAN space
simplify the discovery of temporal correlations. We demonstrate that it
suffices to train our temporal architecture on only 10 minutes of footage of 1

However, in magnetised plasma experiments with strong background fields, the
broadband proton spectrum leads to velocity-spread-dependent displacement of

analysis of the parallaxto-distance transformation problem is presented in the
context of getting distances toward open clusters and estimating their sizes.
Based on our investigation of the Gaia DR2 data we argue that, within 2 kpc,
the inverse-parallax method gives comparable results (distances and sizes) as
the Bayesian approach based on the exponentially decreasing volume density
prior. Both of these methods show very similar dependence of the line-of-sight
elongation of clusters (needle-like shapes resulting from the parallax
uncertainties) on the distance. We also looked at a measure of elongations of
the studied clusters and find the maximum distance of 665 pc at which a
spherical fit still contains about half of the stellar population of a cluster.
It follows from these results that the 3D structure of an open cluster cannot

integrates client-server architecture, edge computing, and real-time
intelligence. FL has the capability of revolutionizing machine learning (ML)
but lacks in the practicality of implementation due to technological
limitations, communication overhead, non-IID (independent and identically
distributed) data, and privacy concerns. Training a ML model over heterogeneous
non-IID data highly degrades the convergence rate and performance. The existing
traditional and clustered FL algorithms exhibit two main limitations, including
inefficient client training and static hyper-parameter utilization. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm, namely genetic
clustered FL (Genetic CFL), that clusters edge devices based on the training
hyper-parameters and genetically modifies the parameters cluster-wise. Then, we
introduce an algorithm that drastically increases the individual cluster
accuracy by integrating the density-based clustering and genetic
hyper-parameter optimization. The results are bench-marked using MNIST
handwritten digit dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. The proposed genetic CFL
shows significant improvements and works well with realistic cases of non-IID
and ambiguous data.

characteristic length scale $L\sim C t^{\alpha}$. To understand the
structure-property relationship, the knowledge of the coarsening exponent
$\alpha$ and the coarsening rate constant $C$ is mandatory. Since the existing
literature is not entirely consistent, we perform phase field simulations based
on the Cahn-Hilliard equation. We restrict ourselves to binary mixtures using a
symmetric Flory-Huggins free energy and a constant mobility term and show that
the coarsening for off-critical mixtures is slower than the expected
$t^{1/3}$-growth. Instead, we find $\alpha$ to be dependent on the mixture
composition and thus from the morphology. Finally, we propose a model to
describe the complete coarsening kinetics including the rate constant $C$.

an arbitrary natural image without any auxiliary input like trimap, which is
useful for image editing. Prior methods try to learn semantic features to aid
the matting process while being limited to images with salient opaque
foregrounds such as humans and animals. In this paper, we investigate the
difficulties when extending them to natural images with salient
transparent/meticulous foregrounds or non-salient foregrounds. To address the
problem, a novel end-to-end matting network is proposed, which can predict a
generalized trimap for any image of the above types as a unified semantic
representation. Simultaneously, the learned semantic features guide the matting
network to focus on the transition areas via an attention mechanism. We also
construct a test set AIM-500 that contains 500 diverse natural images covering
all types along with manually labeled alpha mattes, making it feasible to
benchmark the generalization ability of AIM models. Results of the experiments
demonstrate that our network trained on available composite matting datasets

All local fermion degrees of freedom are gapped and removed from the
topological order by many-body interactions. Bosonic chiral spin liquids and
anyonic superconductors are constructed on an array of interacting wires, each
supports emergent massless Majorana fermions that are non-local (fractional)
and constitute the $SO(N)$ Kac-Moody Wess-Zumino-Witten algebra at level 1. We
focus on the dihedral $D_k$ symmetry of $SO(2n)_1$, and its promotion to a
gauge symmetry by manipulating the locality of fermion pairs. Gauging the
symmetry (sub)group generates the $\mathcal{C}/G$ twist liquids, where
$G=\mathbb{Z}_2$ for $\mathcal{C}=U(1)_l$, $SU(n)_1$, and $G=\mathbb{Z}_2$,
$\mathbb{Z}_k$, $D_k$ for $\mathcal{C}=SO(2n)_1$. We construct exactly solvable

field theories corresponding to the twist liquid topological orders. We analyze

metaplectic anyons and a new class of quasiparticles referred to as

construct dispersion representations in $q^2$ which consistently take into

the range $0 < q^2 \le 1$ GeV$^2$ that saturates around 99% of the decay rate.
The differential decay rate behaves at small $q^2$ as $d\Gamma(B\to l^+l^-l'

singlular contribution of order ${m'^2_l}/q^4$, which we take into account. For

logarithmic dependence of $\Gamma(B\to l^{+}l^{-}l'\nu')$ on $m_l$. For the
case $m_l\ll m'_l$, however, the ${m'^2_l}/q^4$ terms dominate the decay rate
leading to $\Gamma(B\to l^{+}l^{-}l'\nu')\sim m'^2_l/m^2_l$. We find the
following features of the four-lepton $B$-decays: (i) The decay rates
$\Gamma\left(B\to \mu^+\mu^-(\mu \nu_\mu,e\nu_e)\right)$ are fully dominated by
the region of light vector resonances $q^2\simeq M_\rho^2, M_\omega^2$; (ii)
The decay rate $\Gamma(B\to e^{+}e^{-}e \nu_e)$ receives comparable
contributions from the region near $q^2\sim 4m_e^2$ and from the resonance
region; (iii) One finds a strong enhancement of the decay rate $\Gamma(B\to
e^+e^- \mu \nu_\mu)\sim m_\mu^2/m_e^2$ which is dominated by the region
$q^2\sim 4m_e^2$ due to the terms $O(m_\mu^2/q^4)$ in the differential

implies that software engineers influence peoples' lives through the features
of their designed products. Embedded values are thus approached best by
software engineers themselves. Therefore, we put emphasis on the possibility to
implement ethical deliberations in already existing and well established agile
software development processes. Our approach relies on software engineers
making their own judgments throughout the entire development process to ensure
that technical features and ethical evaluation can be addressed adequately to
transport and foster desirable values and norms. We argue that agile software
development processes may help the implementation of ethical deliberation for
five reasons: 1) agile methods are widely spread, 2) their emphasis on flat
hierarchies promotes independent thinking, 3) their reliance on existing team
structures serve as an incubator for deliberation, 4) agile development
enhances object-focused techno-ethical realism, and, finally, 5) agile

avoidance. In those novel scenarios, radars must perform well in dense scenes
with a large number of neighboring scatterers. Central to radar performance is
the detection algorithm used to separate targets from the background noise and
clutter. Traditionally, most radar systems use conventional CFAR detectors but
their performance degrades in indoor scenarios with many reflectors. Inspired
by the advances in non-linear target detection, we propose a novel
high-performance, yet low-complexity target detector and we experimentally
validate our algorithm on a dataset acquired using a radar mounted on a drone.
We experimentally show that our proposed algorithm drastically outperforms
OS-CFAR (standard detector used in automotive systems) for our specific task of
indoor drone navigation with more than 19% higher probability of detection for
a given probability of false alarm. We also benchmark our proposed detector
against a number of recently proposed multi-target CFAR detectors and show an
improvement of 16% in probability of detection compared to CHA-CFAR, with even
larger improvements compared to both OR-CFAR and TS-LNCFAR in our particular
indoor scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this work improves the state of
the art for high-performance yet low-complexity radar detection in critical
indoor sensing applications.

to the chromo-magnetic pseudo-vector current of the non-Abelian Bianchi

on very simple disc models indicated very fast migration times for low mass
planets that raised questions about its relevance. However, more recent
studies, made possible with improving resources, that considered improved
physics and disc models revealed processes that could halt or reverse this
migration. That in turn led to a focus on special regions in the disc where
migration could be halted. In this way the migration of low mass planets could
be reconciled with formation theories. In the case of giant planets which have
a nonlinear interaction with the disc, the migration should be slower and
coupled to the evolution of the disc. The latter needs to be considered more
fully to make future progress in all cases. Here we are primarily concerned
with processes where migration is connected with the presence of the
protopolanetary disk. Migration may also be induced by disc-free gravitational
interactions amongst planets or with binary companions. This is only briefly

histopathology pipelines. The performance of machine learning models such as
convolutional neural networks within automated histopathology pipelines is
often diminished when applying them to novel data domains due to factors
arising from differing staining and scanning protocols. The Dual-Channel
Auto-Encoder (DCAE) model was previously shown to produce feature
representations that are less sensitive to appearance variation introduced by
different digital slide scanners. In this work, the Multi-Channel Auto-Encoder
(MCAE) model is presented as an extension to DCAE which learns from more than
two domains of data. Additionally, a synthetic dataset is generated using
CycleGANs that contains aligned tissue images that have had their appearance
synthetically modified. Experimental results show that the MCAE model produces
feature representations that are less sensitive to inter-domain variations than
the comparative StaNoSA method when tested on the novel synthetic data.
Additionally, the MCAE and StaNoSA models are tested on a novel tissue
classification task. The results of this experiment show the MCAE model out
performs the StaNoSA model by 5 percentage-points in the f1-score. These
results show that the MCAE model is able to generalise better to novel data and
tasks than existing approaches by actively learning normalised feature

Neuron Operator, the deep learning workflow takes input variables or features
including rock properties, well operational controls and time steps, and
predicts the state variables of pressure and CO2 saturation. To further improve
the predictive fidelity, separate deep learning models are trained for CO2
injection and post-injection periods due the difference in primary driving
force of fluid flow and transport during these two phases. We also explore
different combinations of features to predict the state variables. We use a
realistic example of CO2 injection and storage in a 3D heterogeneous saline
aquifer, and apply the deep learning workflow that is trained from
physics-based simulation data and emulate the physics process. Through this
numerical experiment, we demonstrate that using two separate deep learning
models to distinguish post-injection from injection period generates the most
accurate prediction of pressure, and a single deep learning model of the whole
GCS process including the cumulative injection volume of CO2 as a deep learning
feature, leads to the most accurate prediction of CO2 saturation. For the
post-injection period, it is key to use cumulative CO2 injection volume to
inform the deep learning models about the total carbon storage when predicting
either pressure or saturation. The deep learning workflow not only provides
high predictive fidelity across temporal and spatial scales, but also offers a
speedup of 250 times compared to full physics reservoir simulation, and thus
will be a significant predictive tool for engineers to manage the long term

friction coefficient of the material. For increasing applied pressure, the
shear zone evolves toward the center of the cylinder and grows wider and the
angular velocity reduces compared to the driving rate of the bottom disk.
Moreover, the presence of slip promotes the transition from open shear zones at
the top surface to closed shear zones inside the bulk. We also systematically
vary the ratio of the effective friction near the bottom plate and in the bulk
in simulations and observe the resulting impact on the surface flow profile.
Besides the boundary conditions and external load, material properties such as
grain size are also known to influence the effective friction coefficient.
However, our numerical results reveal that the center position and width of the

ensured with respect to a local virtual output which is different from the

covariate by randomised treatment interaction, in a setting where the covariate
is perfectly balanced between randomised treatments. We use mathematical
arguments and analyses of single hypothetical data sets.
  We show that analysis by a generalised linear model with the canonical link
function leads to no error under the null -- that is, if treatment effect is
truly zero under the adjusted model then it is also zero under the unadjusted
model. However, using non-canonical link functions does not give this property
and leads to potentially important error under the null. The error is present
even in large samples and hence constitutes bias.
  We conclude that covariate adjustment analyses of randomised trials should
avoid non-canonical links. If a marginal risk difference is the target of
estimation then this should not be estimated using an identity link;
alternative preferable methods include standardisation and inverse probability

estimates associated to the predictions made. They are also very flexible due
to their non-parametric nature. Nevertheless, GPs suffer from poor scalability
as the number of training instances N increases. More precisely, they have a
cubic cost with respect to $N$. To overcome this problem, sparse GP
approximations are often used, where a set of $M \ll N$ inducing points is
introduced during training. The location of the inducing points is learned by
considering them as parameters of an approximate posterior distribution $q$.
Sparse GPs, combined with variational inference for inferring $q$, reduce the
training cost of GPs to $\mathcal{O}(M^3)$. Critically, the inducing points
determine the flexibility of the model and they are often located in regions of
the input space where the latent function changes. A limitation is, however,
that for some learning tasks a large number of inducing points may be required
to obtain a good prediction performance. To address this limitation, we propose
here to amortize the computation of the inducing points locations, as well as
the parameters of the variational posterior approximation q. For this, we use a
neural network that receives the observed data as an input and outputs the
inducing points locations and the parameters of $q$. We evaluate our method in
several experiments, showing that it performs similar or better than other
state-of-the-art sparse variational GP approaches. However, with our method the
number of inducing points is reduced drastically due to their dependency on the
input data. This makes our method scale to larger datasets and have faster
training and prediction times.

This reveals the source of the instability for the projector splitting

Based on this we propose a projector splitting integrator, based on applying
DLRA to the continuous system before performing the discretization, that
recovers the classic CFL condition. We also show that the unconventional
integrator has more favorable stability properties and explain why the
projector splitting integrator performs better when approximating higher
moments, while the unconventional integrator is generally superior for first

the flavour-changing neutral current decays of charmed hadrons induced by the
$c \to u$ transitions, making such processes particularly sensitive to
phenomena beyond the Standard Model. In particular, $c \to u$ decays with a
neutrino pair in the final state are theoretically appealing due to the small
long-distance contributions. Moreover, in the framework of the Standard Model
Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), the $SU(2)_L$ invariance allows to relate the
Wilson coefficients in the effective Hamiltonian governing the $c \to u \nu
{\bar \nu}$ decays to the coefficients in the $c \to u \ell^+ \ell^-$
Hamiltonian. We analyze the $B_c \to B^{(*)+} \nu {\bar \nu}$ decays, for which
branching fractions of at most ${\cal O}(10^{-16})$ are predicted in the
Standard Model including short- and long-distance contributions, so small that
they can be considered as null tests. Using SMEFT and the relation to the $c
\to u \ell^+ \ell^-$ processes we study the largest enhancement achievable in
generic new physics scenarios. Then we focus on a particular extension of the
Standard Model, the 331 model. SMEFT relations and the connection with $c \to u
\ell^+ \ell^-$ imply that ${\cal B}(B_c \to B^{(*)+} \nu {\bar \nu})$ could
even reach ${\cal O}(10^{-6})$, an extremely large enhancement. A less
pronounced effect is found in the 331 model, with ${\cal O}(10^{-11})$
predicted branching fractions. Within the 331 model correlations exist among
the $B_c \to B^{(*)+}\nu \bar \nu$ and $K\to \pi \nu \bar \nu$, $B\to (X_s, K,
K^*) \nu \bar \nu$ channels.

Langevin dynamics simulations of transitions over arbitrary high energy

our algorithm, simulation time required for the computation of the
corresponding switching rate does not increase with energy barrier. This is
achieved by using in simulations an effective temperature which depends on the
system energy: around the energy minima this temperature is high and tends
towards the room temperature when the energy approaches the saddle point value.
Switching times computed via our EDT algorithm show an excellent agreement with
results obtained with the established forward flux sampling (FFS) method. As
the simulation time required by our method does not increase with the energy
barrier, we achieve a very large speedup when compared even to the highly
optimized FFS version. In addition, our method does not suffer from stability
problems occurring in multi-stage algorithms (like FFS and 'energy bounce'

We relied on a method we recently developed, which employs the 2D Zernike

numbers summarizing the local shape properties. Collected a structural dataset
of antibody-antigen complexes, we applied this method and we statistically
distinguished, in terms of shape complementarity, pairs of interacting regions
from non-interacting ones. Thus, we set up a novel computational strategy based
on \textit{in-silico} mutagenesis of antibody binding site residues. We
developed a Monte Carlo procedure to increase the shape complementarity between
the antibody paratope and a given epitope on a target protein surface. We
applied our protocol against several molecular targets in SARS-CoV-2 spike

optimized the shape of template antibodies for the interaction with such

synchronisation with a ""get"" operation blocks the caller until the computation
is over, to return the corresponding value. When a computation in charge of
fulfilling a future delegates part of its processing to another task,
mainstream languages return nested futures, and several ""get"" operations are
needed to retrieve the computed value (we call such futures ""control-flow
futures""). Several approaches were proposed to tackle this issues: the
""forward"" construct, that allows the programmer to make delegation explicit and
avoid nested futures, and ""data-flow explicit futures"" which natively collapse
nested futures into plain futures. This paper supports the claim that data-flow
explicit futures form a powerful set of language primitives, on top of which
other approaches can be built. We prove the equivalence, in the context of
data-flow explicit futures, between the ""forward"" construct and classical
""return"" from functions. The proof relies on a branching bisimulation between a
program using ""forward"" and its ""return"" counterpart. This result allows
language designers to consider ""forward"" as an optimisation directive rather
than as a language primitive. Following the principles of the Godot system, we
provide a library implementation of control-flow futures, based on data-flow
explicit futures implemented in the compiler. This small library supports the
claim that the implementation of classical futures based on data-flow ones is
easier than the opposite. Our benchmarks show the viability of the approach
from a performance point of view.

Security Protection (RASP) are important and complementary techniques used for
detecting and enforcing application-level security policies in web
applications.
  Inquiry: The current state of the art, however, does not allow a safe and
efficient combination of SAST and RASP based on a shared set of security
policies, forcing developers to reimplement and maintain the same policies and
their enforcement code in both tools.
  Approach: In this work, we present a novel technique for deriving SAST from
an existing RASP mechanism by using a two-phase abstract interpretation
approach in the SAST component that avoids duplicating the effort of specifying
security policies and implementing their semantics. The RASP mechanism enforces
security policies by instrumenting a base program to trap security-relevant
operations and execute the required policy enforcement code. The static
analysis of security policies is then obtained from the RASP mechanism by first
statically analyzing the base program without any traps. The results of this
first phase are used in a second phase to detect trapped operations and
abstractly execute the associated and unaltered RASP policy enforcement code.
  Knowledge: Splitting the analysis into two phases enables running each phase
with a specific analysis configuration, rendering the static analysis approach
tractable while maintaining sufficient precision.
  Grounding: We validate the applicability of our two-phase analysis approach
by using it to both dynamically enforce and statically detect a range of
security policies found in related work. Our experiments suggest that our
two-phase analysis can enable faster and more precise policy violation
detection compared to analyzing the full instrumented application under a
single analysis configuration.
  Importance: Deriving a SAST component from a RASP mechanism enables
equivalent semantics for the security policies across the static and dynamic
contexts in which policies are verified during the software development
lifecycle. Moreover, our two-phase abstract interpretation approach does not
require RASP developers to reimplement the enforcement code for static
analysis.

transfer from LaSe to $NbSe_2$. As shown in our previous work,
$(LaSe)_{1.14}(NbSe_2)$ is electronically equivalent to the highly doped

the Ising coupling recently discovered in atomically thin transition metal
dichalcogenides with strong spin-orbit coupling and a lack of inversion
symmetry. A very similar behavior is found in $(LaSe)_{1.14}(NbSe_2)_2$, where
the charge transfer is nominally twice as big, which could eventually lead to
complete filling of the $NbSe_2$ conduction band and opening superconductivity
in LaSe. Whatever the particular superconducting mechanism would be, a common
denominator in both misfits is that they behave as a stack of almost decoupled
superconducting atomic layers, proving that Ising superconductivity can also
exist in bulk materials.

sparsity-aware neural network accelerators. As the predominant operation in

products, skipping operations where (at least) one of the two operands is zero
can make inference more efficient in terms of latency and power. Spatial
sparsification of activations is a popular topic in DNN literature and several
methods have already been established to bias a DNN for it. On the other hand,
temporal sparsity is an inherent feature of bio-inspired spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which neuromorphic processing exploits for hardware
efficiency. Introducing and exploiting spatio-temporal sparsity, is a topic
much less explored in DNN literature, but in perfect resonance with the trend
in DNN, to shift from static signal processing to more streaming signal
processing. Towards this goal, in this paper we introduce a new DNN layer
(called Delta Activation Layer), whose sole purpose is to promote temporal
sparsity of activations during training. A Delta Activation Layer casts
temporal sparsity into spatial activation sparsity to be exploited when
performing sparse tensor multiplications in hardware. By employing delta
inference and ``the usual'' spatial sparsification heuristics during training,
the resulting model learns to exploit not only spatial but also temporal
activation sparsity (for a given input data distribution). One may use the
Delta Activation Layer either during vanilla training or during a refinement
phase. We have implemented Delta Activation Layer as an extension of the
standard Tensoflow-Keras library, and applied it to train deep neural networks

  Delp","Panicle Counting in UAV Images For Estimating Flowering Time in Sorghum",,,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flowering time (time to flower after planting) is important for estimating
plant development and grain yield for many crops including sorghum. Flowering
time of sorghum can be approximated by counting the number of panicles
(clusters of grains on a branch) across multiple dates. Traditional manual
methods for panicle counting are time-consuming and tedious. In this paper, we
propose a method for estimating flowering time and rapidly counting panicles
using RGB images acquired by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We evaluate
three different deep neural network structures for panicle counting and
location. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to
accurately detect panicles and estimate sorghum flowering time.

latent variables to guide sentence generation by aligning image and language
modalities in a latent space. The topics are inferred in a conditional
variational inference framework, with each topic governing the generation of a
sentence in the report. Further, we adopt a visual attention module that
enables the model to attend to different locations in the image and generate
more informative descriptions. We conduct extensive experiments on two
benchmarks, namely Indiana U. Chest X-rays and MIMIC-CXR. The results
demonstrate that our proposed variational topic inference method can generate
novel reports rather than mere copies of reports used in training, while still
achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods in terms of
standard language generation criteria.

usually performed with computational fluid dynamics codes, mostly in Eulerian
but also in Lagrangian formulation such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH). Codes include our best knowledge of nuclear matter in the form of an
equation of state as well as effects of general relativity (GR). However, one
important aspect of neutron stars is usually ignored: the solid nature of their
crust. The solid matter in the crust is the strongest material known in nature
which could lead to a multitude of possible observational effects that have not
been studied in dynamical simulations yet. The crust could change the way a
neutron star deforms during a merger, leaving an imprint in the gravitational
wave signal. It could even shatter during the inspiral, producing a potentially
observable electromagnetic signal. Here, we present a first study of the
dynamical behavior of neutron stars with a solid crust and fixed GR background
with FleCSPH. FleCSPH is a general-purpose SPH code, developed at Los Alamos
National Laboratory. It features an efficient algorithm for gravitational
interactions via the Fast Multipole Method, which, together with the
implemented nuclear equation of state, makes it appropriate for astrophysical
applications. The solid material dynamics is described via the
elastic-perfectly plastic model with maximum-strain breaking. Despite its
simplicity, the model reproduces the stress-strain curve of crustal material as
extracted from microphysical simulations very well. We present first tests of

safety critical domains like autonomous vehicles is still challenging. Although
punishing RL agents for risky situations can help to learn safe policies, it
may also lead to highly conservative behavior. In this paper, we propose a
distributional RL framework in order to learn adaptive policies that can tune
their level of conservativity at run-time based on the desired comfort and
utility. Using a proactive safety verification approach, the proposed framework
can guarantee that actions generated from RL are fail-safe according to the
worst-case assumptions. Concurrently, the policy is encouraged to minimize
safety interference and generate more comfortable behavior. We trained and
evaluated the proposed approach and baseline policies using a high level
simulator with a variety of randomized scenarios including several corner cases
which rarely happen in reality but are very crucial. In light of our
experiments, the behavior of policies learned using distributional RL can be
adaptive at run-time and robust to the environment uncertainty. Quantitatively,
the learned distributional RL agent drives in average 8 seconds faster than the
normal DQN policy and requires 83\% less safety interference compared to the
rule-based policy with slightly increasing the average crossing time. We also
study sensitivity of the learned policy in environments with higher perception
noise and show that our algorithm learns policies that can still drive reliable

discovery rate (FDR). We propose a unified, modular framework for bandit FDR
control that emphasizes the decoupling of exploration and summarization of
evidence. We utilize the powerful martingale-based concept of ""e-processes"" to
ensure FDR control for arbitrary composite nulls, exploration rules and
stopping times in generic problem settings. In particular, valid FDR control
holds even if the reward distributions of the arms could be dependent, multiple
arms may be queried simultaneously, and multiple (cooperating or competing)
agents may be querying arms, covering combinatorial semi-bandit type settings
as well. Prior work has considered in great detail the setting where each arm's
reward distribution is independent and sub-Gaussian, and a single arm is
queried at each step. Our framework recovers matching sample complexity
guarantees in this special case, and performs comparably or better in practice.
For other settings, sample complexities will depend on the finer details of the
problem (composite nulls being tested, exploration algorithm, data dependence
structure, stopping rule) and we do not explore these; our contribution is to
show that the FDR guarantee is clean and entirely agnostic to these details.

It

Empirical studies suggest that cohesion is affected by both the admission
process of new members and the group size. Yet, a theoretical understanding of
their interplay is still lacking. To this end, we propose a model where a group
grows by a noisy admission process of new members who can be of two different
types. Cohesion is defined in this framework as the fraction of members of the
same type and the noise in the admission process represents the level of
randomness in the evaluation of new candidates. The model can reproduce the
empirically reported decrease of cohesion with the group size. When the
admission of new candidates involves the decision of only one group member, the
group growth causes a loss of cohesion even for infinitesimal levels of noise.
However, when admissions require a consensus of several group members, there is
a critical noise level below which the growing group remains cohesive. The
nature of the transition between the cohesive and non-cohesive phases depends
on the model parameters and forms a rich structure reminiscent of critical
phenomena in ferromagnetic materials.

conductance reaching $0.48 G_0$. This is made possible by the unusually good
alignment of the singly occupied or unoccupied molecular orbital with the Fermi
level of the electrodes, overcoming the limitations of Fermi level pinning that
typically plague molecular electronics. We show that this interplay between
excellent conductance and high spin-filter efficiency is determined by the
energy alignment between the singly (un)occupied molecular orbital and the
Fermi level of the electrodes, and that for phenalenyls this can be readily
controlled with judicious heteroatom substitution.

concern for the security staff. Many researchers have developed frameworks that
can detect baggage threats from X-ray scans. However, to the best of our
knowledge, all of these frameworks require extensive training on large-scale
and well-annotated datasets, which are hard to procure in the real world. This
paper presents a novel unsupervised anomaly instance segmentation framework
that recognizes baggage threats, in X-ray scans, as anomalies without requiring
any ground truth labels. Furthermore, thanks to its stylization capacity, the
framework is trained only once, and at the inference stage, it detects and
extracts contraband items regardless of their scanner specifications. Our
one-staged approach initially learns to reconstruct normal baggage content via
an encoder-decoder network utilizing a proposed stylization loss function. The
model subsequently identifies the abnormal regions by analyzing the disparities
within the original and the reconstructed scans. The anomalous regions are then
clustered and post-processed to fit a bounding box for their localization. In
addition, an optional classifier can also be appended with the proposed
framework to recognize the categories of these extracted anomalies. A thorough
evaluation of the proposed system on four public baggage X-ray datasets,
without any re-training, demonstrates that it achieves competitive performance
as compared to the conventional fully supervised methods (i.e., the mean
average precision score of 0.7941 on SIXray, 0.8591 on GDXray, 0.7483 on
OPIXray, and 0.5439 on COMPASS-XP dataset) while outperforming state-of-the-art

widespread practice to reduce the computational cost of large-eddy simulations

wall-model, a neural-network-based approach to predict the near-wall behaviour

trained to predict the two-dimensional velocity-fluctuation fields at
$y^{+}_{\rm target}$, using the sampled fluctuations in wall-parallel planes
located farther from the wall, at $y^{+}_{\rm input}$. The data for training
and testing is obtained from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) at friction
Reynolds numbers $Re_{\tau} = 180$ and $550$. The turbulent
velocity-fluctuation fields are sampled at various wall-normal locations, i.e.
$y^{+} = \{15, 30, 50, 80, 100, 120, 150\}$. At $Re_{\tau}=550$, the FCN can
take advantage of the self-similarity in the logarithmic region of the flow and
predict the velocity-fluctuation fields at $y^{+} = 50$ using the
velocity-fluctuation fields at $y^{+} = 100$ as input with less than 20% error
in prediction of streamwise-fluctuations intensity. These results are an
encouraging starting point to develop a neural-network based approach for
modelling turbulence at the wall in numerical simulations.

to quickly recover an approximately Fourier $k$-sparse vector $\widehat{x} \in
\mathbb{C}^{n^d}$ from observing its time domain representation $x$. In the
exact $k$-sparse case the best known dimension-independent algorithm runs in
near cubic time in $k$ and it is unclear whether a faster algorithm like in low
dimensions is possible. Beyond that, all known approaches either suffer from an
exponential dependence on the dimension $d$ or can only tolerate a trivial
amount of noise. This is in sharp contrast with the classical FFT of Cooley and
Tukey, which is stable and completely insensitive to the dimension of the input
vector: its runtime is $O(N\log N)$ in any dimension $d$ for $N=n^d$. Our work
aims to address the above issues.
  First, we provide a translation/reduction of the exactly $k$-sparse FT
problem to a concrete tree exploration task which asks to recover $k$ leaves in
a full binary tree under certain exploration rules. Subsequently, we provide
(a) an almost quadratic in $k$ time algorithm for this task, and (b) evidence
that a strongly subquadratic time for Sparse FT via this approach is likely
impossible. We achieve the latter by proving a conditional quadratic time lower
bound on sparse polynomial multipoint evaluation (the classical non-equispaced
sparse FT) which is a core routine in the aforementioned translation. Thus, our
results combined can be viewed as an almost complete understanding of this
approach, which is the only known approach that yields sublinear time
dimension-independent Sparse FT algorithms.
  Subsequently, we provide a robustification of our algorithm, yielding a
robust cubic time algorithm under bounded $\ell_2$ noise. This requires proving
new structural properties of the recently introduced adaptive aliasing filters
combined with a variety of new techniques and ideas.

have been built over the past two decades, to solve the problem of imbalanced
datasets. However, it has been evident from previous studies that different
oversampling algorithms have different degrees of efficiency with different
classifiers. With numerous algorithms available, it is difficult to decide on
an oversampling algorithm for a chosen classifier. Here, we overcome this
problem with a multi-schematic and classifier-independent oversampling
approach: ProWRAS(Proximity Weighted Random Affine Shadowsampling). ProWRAS
integrates the Localized Random Affine Shadowsampling (LoRAS)algorithm and the
Proximity Weighted Synthetic oversampling (ProWSyn) algorithm. By controlling
the variance of the synthetic samples, as well as a proximity-weighted
clustering system of the minority classdata, the ProWRAS algorithm improves
performance, compared to algorithms that generate synthetic samples through
modelling high dimensional convex spaces of the minority class. ProWRAS has
four oversampling schemes, each of which has its unique way to model the
variance of the generated data. Most importantly, the performance of ProWRAS
with proper choice of oversampling schemes, is independent of the classifier
used. We have benchmarked our newly developed ProWRAS algorithm against five
sate-of-the-art oversampling models and four different classifiers on 20
publicly available datasets. ProWRAS outperforms other oversampling algorithms
in a statistically significant way, in terms of both F1-score and Kappa-score.
Moreover, we have introduced a novel measure for classifier independence
I-score, and showed quantitatively that ProWRAS performs better, independent of
the classifier used. In practice, ProWRAS customizes synthetic sample
generation according to a classifier of choice and thereby reduces benchmarking
efforts.

candidate attributes. The models that focus on candidate attributes alone may
systematically under-represent smaller voter populations. Hence, we develop a
model, DiRe Committee WinnerDetermination (DRCWD), which delineates candidate

representation constraints and a voting rule. We analyze its computational
complexity, inapproximability, and parameterized complexity. We develop a
heuristic-based algorithm, which finds the winning DiRe committee in under two

  Overall, DRCWD motivates that a study of multiwinner elections should
consider both its actors, namely candidates and voters, as candidate-specific
models can unknowingly harm voter populations, and vice versa. Additionally,
even when the attributes of candidates and voters coincide, it is important to
treat them separately as diversity does not imply representation and vice
versa. This is to say that having a female candidate on the committee, for
example, is different from having a candidate on the committee who is preferred
by the female voters, and who themselves may or may not be female.

asked participants to sketch visual imagery of sounds with a monochromatic

on random walks [Proceedings of FOCS, 2004, pp. 32-41]. A major contribution of
his work was the construction of a walk unitary for any reversible random walk.
Such unitary posses two crucial properties: its eigenvector with eigenphase $0$
is a quantum sample of the limiting distribution of the random walk and its
eigenphase gap is quadratically larger than the spectral gap of the random
walk. It was an open question if it is possible to generalize Szegedy's
quantization method for stochastic maps to quantum maps. We answer this in the
affirmative by presenting an explicit construction of a Szegedy walk unitary
for detailed balanced Lindbladians -- generators of quantum Markov semigroups
-- and detailed balanced quantum channels. We prove that our Szegedy walk
unitary has a purification of the fixed point of the Lindbladian as eigenvector
with eigenphase $0$ and that its eigenphase gap is quadratically larger than
the spectral gap of the Lindbladian. To construct the walk unitary we leverage
a canonical form for detailed balanced Lindbladians showing that they are
structurally related to Davies generators. We also explain how the quantization
method for Lindbladians can be applied to quantum channels. We give an
efficient quantum algorithm for quantizing Davies generators that describe many
important open-system dynamics, for instance, the relaxation of a quantum

treat the temperature as a fluctuating random variable and not a control

probability distribution in configuration and temperature space. The results
here are demonstrated for a chirally symmetric peptide and single-strand
ribonucleic acid undergoing conformational transitions in all-atom water. We
demonstrate how we can discover transition states and metastable states that
were previously unseen at the temperature of interest, and even bypass the need
to perform further simulations for wide range of temperatures. At the same
time, any unphysical states are easily identifiable through very low Boltzmann
weights. The procedure while shown here for a class of molecular simulations
should be more generally applicable to mixing information across simulations

for imputation, its statistical properties are not investigated in the

first establish the root-$n$ consistency of the kernel ridge regression
imputation estimator and show that it achieves the lower bound of the
semiparametric asymptotic variance. A nonparametric propensity score estimator
using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is also developed by a novel
application of the maximum entropy method for the density ratio function
estimation. We show that the resulting propensity score estimator is
asymptotically equivalent to the kernel ridge regression imputation estimator.

theory. The proposed method is applied to analyze the air pollution data

a result of their moment-to-moment interaction with automation. Background:
Most existing studies measured trust by administering questionnaires at the end
of an experiment. Only a limited number of studies viewed trust as a dynamic
variable that can strengthen or decay over time. Method: Seventy-five
participants took part in an aided memory recognition task. In the task,
participants viewed a series of images and later on performed 40 trials of the
recognition task to identify a target image when it was presented with a
distractor. In each trial, participants performed the initial recognition by
themselves, received a recommendation from an automated decision aid, and
performed the final recognition. After each trial, participants reported their
trust on a visual analog scale. Results: Outcome bias and contrast effect
significantly influence human operators' trust adjustments. An automation
failure leads to a larger trust decrement if the final outcome is undesirable,
and a marginally larger trust decrement if the human operator succeeds the task
by him-/her-self. An automation success engenders a greater trust increment if
the human operator fails the task. Additionally, automation failures have a
larger effect on trust adjustment than automation successes. Conclusion: Human
operators adjust their trust in automation as a result of their
moment-to-moment interaction with automation. Their trust adjustments are
significantly influenced by decision-making heuristics/biases. Application:
Understanding the trust adjustment process enables accurate prediction of the
operators' moment-to-moment trust in automation and informs the design of
trust-aware adaptive automation.

since the work of Ryser(1963) and Valiant(1979). On the other hand, trellises
were extensively studied in coding theory since the 1960s. In this work, we
establish a connection between the two domains. We introduce the canonical
trellis $T_n$ that represents all permutations, and show that the permanent of
a $n$ by $n$ matrix $A$ can be computed as a flow on this trellis. Under
certain normalization, the trellis-based method invokes slightly less
operations than best known exact methods. Moreover, if $A$ has structure, then
$T_n$ becomes amenable to vertex merging, thereby significantly reducing its
complexity.
  - Repeated rows: Suppose $A$ has only $t<n$ distinct rows. The best known
method to compute $per(A)$, due to Clifford and Clifford (2020), has complexity
$O(n^{t+1})$. Merging vertices in $T_n$, we obtain a reduced trellis that has
complexity $O(n^t)$.
  - Order statistics: Using trellises, we compute the joint distribution of $t$
order statistics of $n$ independent, but not identically distributed, random
variables in time $O(n^{t+1})$. Previously, polynomial-time methods were known
only when the variables are drawn from two non-identical distributions.
  - Sparse matrices: Suppose each entry in $A$ is nonzero with probability
$d/n$ with $d$ is constant. We show that $T_n$ can be pruned to exponentially
fewer vertices, resulting in complexity $O(\phi^n)$ with $\phi<2$.
  - TSP: Intersecting $T_n$ with another trellis that represents walks, we
obtain a trellis that represents circular permutations. Using the latter
trellis to solve the traveling salesperson problem recovers the well-known
Held-Karp algorithm.
  Notably, in all cases, the reduced trellis are obtained using known
techniques in trellis theory. We expect other trellis-theoretic results to
apply to other structured matrices.

crucial before using such data for downstream applications. For a given
dataset, this often involves computing the imbalance or disparity in the
empirical marginal distribution of a protected attribute (e.g. gender, dialect,
etc.). However, real-world datasets, such as images from Google Search or
collections of Twitter posts, often do not have protected attributes labeled.
Consequently, to derive disparity measures for such datasets, the elements need
to hand-labeled or crowd-annotated, which are expensive processes.
  We propose a cost-effective approach to approximate the disparity of a given
unlabeled dataset, with respect to a protected attribute, using a control set
of labeled representative examples. Our proposed algorithm uses the pairwise
similarity between elements in the dataset and elements in the control set to
effectively bootstrap an approximation to the disparity of the dataset.
Importantly, we show that using a control set whose size is much smaller than
the size of the dataset is sufficient to achieve a small approximation error.
Further, based on our theoretical framework, we also provide an algorithm to
construct adaptive control sets that achieve smaller approximation errors than
randomly chosen control sets. Simulations on two image datasets and one Twitter
dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach (using random and adaptive
control sets) in auditing the diversity of a wide variety of datasets.

diffusion coefficient. In this work, we examine this effect by taking the
generalized J\""uttner propagator as the approximate relativistic Green's
function for diffusion and find that the morphology of the Geminga halo can be
marginally fitted in the fast-diffusion scenario. However, the recently
discovered $\gamma$-ray halo around PSR J0622$+$3749 at LHAASO cannot be
explained by the same effect and slow diffusion is the only solution.
Furthermore, both the two pulsar halos require a conversion efficiency from the
pulsar spin-down energy to the high energy electrons/positrons much larger than
100\%, if they are interpreted by this ballistic transport effect. Therefore,
we conclude that slow diffusion is necessary to account for the $\gamma$-ray

Bose system exhibiting quantum phase transition (QPT) by controlling pressure.
Previous studies revealed that the QPT occurs with four - dimensional (4D) XY
criticality, which appears in the zero-temperature limit of the superfluid
density. However, the $P-T$ phase diagram also suggested that 4D XY nature
appears at finite temperatures. Here, we have determined the critical exponent
of the superfluid density of $^4$He in two Gelsil samples that have pore
diameter to be about 3 nm, using a newly developed mechanical resonator
technique. The critical exponent $\zeta$ in the powerlaw fitting $\rho_{\mathrm
s} \propto \left| 1 - T/T_{\mathrm c} \right| ^{\zeta}$, where $T_{\mathrm c}$
is the superfluid transition temperature, was found to be 1.0 $\pm$ 0.1 for all
pressures realized in this experiment, 0.1 $<$ $P$ $<$ 2.4 MPa. This value of
$\zeta$ gives a decisive evidence that the finite-temperature superfluid
transition belongs to 4D XY universality class. The emergence of the 4D XY
criticality is explained by the existence of many nanoscale superfluid
droplets, the so called localized Bose - Einstein condensates (LBECs), above
$T_{\mathrm c}$. Due to the large energy cost for $^4$He atoms to move between
the LBECs, the phase of the LBEC order parameters fluctuates not only in
spatial (3D) but imaginary time ($+1$D) dimensions, resulting in the 4D XY
criticality by a temperature near $T_{\mathrm c}$, which is determined by the
finite size of the system in the imaginary time dimension. Below $T_{\mathrm
c}$, macroscopic superfluidity grows in the nanopores of Gelsil by the
alignment of the phases of the LBEC order parameters. An excess dissipation
peak observed below $T_{\mathrm c}$ is well explained by this phase matching
process.

method for the indirect detection of axion dark matter has recently received
significant attention in the literature. The calculation of the radio signal is
complicated by a number of effects; most importantly, the gravitational infall
of the axions onto the neutron star accelerates them to semi-relativistic
speed, and the neutron star magnetosphere is highly anisotropic. Both of these
factors complicate the calculation of the conversion of axions to photons. In
this work, we present the first fully three-dimensional calculation of the
axion-photon conversion in highly magnetised anisotropic media. Depending on
the axion trajectory, this calculation leads to orders-of-magnitude differences
in the conversion compared to the simplified one-dimensional calculation used
so far in the literature, altering the directionality of the produced photons.
Our results will have important implications for the radio signal one would

solution of our problem we adopt a probabilistic methodology and view the
querying times as consecutive stopping times which we optimize with the help of
optimal stopping theory. For each querying time we must also design a mechanism
to decide whether we should terminate the search at the querying time or not.
This decision is straightforward under the usual assumption of infallible
experts but, when experts are faulty, it has a far more intricate structure.

impact of aviation, without limiting the growth of air transport, is the
introduction of more efficient, radically different aircraft architectures.
Among these, the box-wing one represents a promising solution, at least in the
case of its application to short-to-medium haul aircraft, which, according to
the achievement of the H2020 project ""PARSIFAL"", would bring to a 20% reduction
in terms of emitted CO2 per passenger-kilometre. The present paper faces the
problem of estimating the structural mass of such a disruptive configuration in
the early stages of the design, underlining the limitations in this capability
of the approaches available by literature and proposing a DoE-based approach to
define surrogate models suitable for such purpose. A test case from the project
""PARSIFAL"" is used for the first conception of the approach, starting from the
Finite Element Model parametrization, then followed by the construction of a
database of FEM results, hence introducing the regression models and
implementing them in an optimization framework. Results achieved are
investigated in order to validate both the wing sizing and the optimization
procedure. Finally, an additional test case resulting from the application of
the box-wing layout to the regional aircraft category within the Italian
research project ""PROSIB"", is briefly presented to further assess the
capabilities of the proposed approach.

a single multimode interferometer (MMI), which mixes and randomizes the signals
into 64 outputs to be used for compressed sensing. Our device is fully passive,
having no need for phase shifters, as measurement matrix calibration makes the
measurements robust to phase errors. For testing, we use an Amplified
Spontaneous Emission (ASE) source with a bandwidth of 40 nm, centered at 1545
nm. We demonstrate simultaneous multi-point (2 sources demonstrated in this

precision in a sub-millimeter thick form-factor. We achieve a single source

re-quired. Trade finance is one of these areas that would benefit immensely
from a decentralized way of doing transactions. This paper presents the
preliminary as-sessment of Accepire-BT, a software platform developed for the
practice of col-laborative Trade Finance. The proposed solution is enforced by
smart contracts using Solidity, the underlying programming language for the
Ethereum block-chain. We evaluated the performance in the Rinkeby test network
by using Remix and MetaMask. The results of the preliminary trial show that
smart contracts take less than one minute per cycle. Also, we present a
discussion about costs for us-ing the public Ethereum Rinkeby network.

  local supersaturation balance at a warm Cloud Top Boundary",,"Physics of Fluids 34, 067103 (2022)","10.1063/5.0090664",,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent results have shown that there is an acceleration in the spread of the
size distribution of droplet populations in the region bordering the cloud and
undersaturated ambient. We have analyzed the supersaturation balance in this
region, which is typically a highly intermittent shearless turbulent mixing
layer, under a condition where there is no mean updraft. We have investigated
the evolution of the cloud-clear air interface and of the droplets therein via
direct numerical simulations. We have compared horizontal averages of the phase
relaxation, evaporation, reaction and condensation times within the cloud-clear
air interface for the size distributions of the initial monodisperse and
polydisperse droplets. For the monodisperse population, a clustering of the
values of the reaction, phase and evaporation times, that is around 20-30
seconds, is observed in the central area of the mixing layer, just before the
location where the maximum value of the supersaturation turbulent flux occurs.
This clustering of values is similar for the polydisperse population but also
includes the condensation time. The mismatch between the time derivative of the
supersaturation and the condensation term in the interfacial mixing layer is
correlated with the planar covariance of the horizontal longitudinal velocity
derivatives of the carrier air flow and the supersaturation field, thus
suggesting that a quasi-linear relationship may exist between these quantities.

European gambling market worth 98.6 billion euro in 2019. Considering a
high-resolution (1 Hz) data set provided by a large European bookmaker, we
investigate the effect of news on the dynamics of live betting. In particular,
we consider stakes placed in a live betting market during football matches.
Accounting for the general market activity level within a state-space modelling
framework, we focus on the market's response to events such as goals (i.e.
major news), but also to the general situation within a match such as the
uncertainty about the outcome. Our results indicate that markets might
overreact to recent news, confirming cognitive biases known from psychology and
behavioural economics.

extraction in performing scribal hand analysis of the Linear B writing system.
While prior work has demonstrated the usefulness of strategies such as
phylogenetic systematics in tracing Linear B's history, these approaches have
relied on manually extracted features which can be very time consuming to
define by hand. Instead we propose learning features using a fully unsupervised
neural network that does not require any human annotation. Specifically our
model assigns each glyph written by the same scribal hand a shared vector
embedding to represent that author's stylistic patterns, and each glyph
representing the same syllabic sign a shared vector embedding to represent the
identifying shape of that character. Thus the properties of each image in our
dataset are represented as the combination of a scribe embedding and a sign
embedding. We train this model using both a reconstructive loss governed by a
decoder that seeks to reproduce glyphs from their corresponding embeddings, and
a discriminative loss which measures the model's ability to predict whether or
not an embedding corresponds to a given image. Among the key contributions of
this work we (1) present a new dataset of Linear B glyphs, annotated by scribal
hand and sign type, (2) propose a neural model for disentangling properties of
scribal hands from glyph shape, and (3) quantitatively evaluate the learned
embeddings on findplace prediction and similarity to manually extracted
features, showing improvements over simpler baseline methods.

Adams","Fundamental Limits on Substructure Dielectric Resonator Antennas","10 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show theoretically that the characteristic modes of dielectric resonator
antennas (DRAs) must be capacitive in the low frequency limit, and show that as
a consequence of this constraint and the Poincar\'{e} Separation Theorem, the
modes of any DRA consisting of partial elements of an encompassing
super-structure cannot resonate at a frequency that is lower than that of the
encompassing structure. Thus, design techniques relying on complex
sub-structures to miniaturize the antenna, including topology optimization and
meandered windings, cannot apply to DRAs. Due to the capacitive nature of the
DRA modes, it is also shown that the Q factor of any DRA sub-structure will be
bounded from below by that of the super-structure at frequencies below the
first self-resonance of the super-structure. We demonstrate these bounding
relations with numerical examples.

curves can be explained by retardation. However, this will rely on a temporal
change of galactic mass. In our previous work, we kept only second order terms
of the retardation time in our analysis, while higher terms in the Taylor
expansion where not considered. Here we consider analysis to all orders and
show that a second order analysis will indeed suffice, and higher order terms
can be neglected.
