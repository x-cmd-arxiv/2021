scenarios that were not foreseen at design time remains an open challenge. In
this paper we propose an approach for adaptation of mobile robot missions that
is not constrained to a predefined set of mission evolutions. We propose
applying the MORPH adaptive software architecture to UAVs and show how
controller synthesis can be used both to guarantee correct transitioning from
the old to the new mission goals while architectural reconfiguration to include
new software actuators and sensors if necessary. The architecture brings
together architectural concepts that are commonplace in robotics such as
temporal planning, discrete, hybrid and continuous control layers together with
architectural concepts from adaptive systems such as runtime models and runtime
synthesis. We validate the architecture flying several missions taken from the
robotic literature for different real and simulated UAVs.

threats brought by deep learning models to data security and privacy,
especially in the field of domain adaptation. Existing unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods can achieve promising performance without transferring
data from source domain to target domain. However, UDA with representation
alignment or self-supervised pseudo-labeling relies on the transferred source
models. In many data-critical scenarios, methods based on model transferring
may suffer from membership inference attacks and expose private data. In this
paper, we aim to overcome a challenging new setting where the source models
cannot be transferred to the target domain. We propose Domain Adaptation
without Source Model, which refines information from source model. In order to
gain more informative results, we further propose Distributionally Adversarial
Training (DAT) to align the distribution of source data with that of target
data. Experimental results on benchmarks of Digit-Five, Office-Caltech,
Office-31, Office-Home, and DomainNet demonstrate the feasibility of our method
without model transferring.

preceded by a screening step to significantly reduce the dimension. Here a
Bayesian variable screening method (BITS) is developed. BITS can successfully
integrate prior knowledge, if any, on effect sizes, and the number of true
variables. BITS iteratively includes potential variables with the highest
posterior probability accounting for the already selected variables. It is
implemented by a fast Cholesky update algorithm and is shown to have the
screening consistency property. BITS is built based on a model with Gaussian
errors, yet, the screening consistency is proved to hold under more general
tail conditions. The notion of posterior screening consistency allows the
resulting model to provide a good starting point for further Bayesian variable
selection methods. A new screening consistent stopping rule based on posterior
probability is developed. Simulation studies and real data examples are used to
demonstrate scalability and fine screening performance.

with applications to cosmology and to the theory of fundamental interactions.
This fascinating phenomenon is even more intriguing when combined with the
confinement of elementary particles. Due to the astronomical time scales
involved, the research has so far focused on theoretical aspects of this decay.
The purpose of this Letter is to show that the false vacuum decay is accessible
to current optical experiments as quantum analog simulators of spin chains with
confinement of the elementary excitations, which mimic the high energy
phenomenology but in one spatial dimension. We study the non-equilibrium
dynamics of the false vacuum in a quantum Ising chain and in an XXZ ladder. The
false vacuum is the metastable state that arises in the ferromagnetic phase of
the model when the symmetry is explicitly broken by a longitudinal field. This
state decays through the formation of ""bubbles"" of true vacuum. Using iTEBD
simulations, we are able to study the real-time evolution in the thermodynamic
limit and measure the decay rate of local observables. We find that the
numerical results agree with the theoretical prediction that the decay rate is
exponentially small in the inverse of the longitudinal field.

boundary method (IBM) based on Cartesian grids, recently in the context of
high-order methods. IBM based on volume penalization is a robust and easy to
implement method to avoid body-fitted meshes and has been recently adapted to
high order discretisations (Kou et al., 2021). This work proposes an
improvement over the classic penalty formulation for flux reconstruction high
order solvers. We include a selective frequency damping (SFD) approach
(Aakervik et al., 2006) acting only inside solid body defined through the
immersed boundary masking, to damp spurious oscillations. An encapsulated
formulation for the SFD method is implemented, which can be used as a wrapper
around an existing time-stepping code. The numerical properties have been
studied through eigensolution analysis based on the advection equation. These
studies not only show the advantages of using the SFD method as an alternative
of the traditional volume penalization, but also show the favorable properties
of combining both approaches. This new approach is then applied to the
Navier-Stokes equation to simulate steady flow past an airfoil and unsteady
flow past a circular cylinder. The advantages of the SFD method in providing
improved accuracy are reported.

  Major Depressive Disorder","21 pages, 2 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Background: The evolution of symptoms over time is at the heart of
understanding and treating mental disorders. However, a principled,
quantitative framework explaining symptom dynamics remains elusive. Here, we
propose a Network Control Theory of Psychopathology allowing us to formally
derive a theoretical control energy which we hypothesize quantifies resistance
to future symptom improvement in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We test this
hypothesis and investigate the relation to genetic and environmental risk as
well as resilience.
  Methods: We modelled longitudinal symptom-network dynamics derived from
N=2,059 Beck Depression Inventory measurements acquired over a median of 134
days in a sample of N=109 patients suffering from MDD. We quantified the
theoretical energy required for each patient and time-point to reach a
symptom-free state given individual symptom-network topology (E 0 ) and 1)
tested if E 0 predicts future symptom improvement and 2) whether this
relationship is moderated by Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) of mental disorders,
childhood maltreatment experience, and self-reported resilience.
  Outcomes: We show that E 0 indeed predicts symptom reduction at the next
measurement and reveal that this coupling between E 0 and future symptom change
increases with higher genetic risk and childhood maltreatment while it
decreases with resilience.
  Interpretation: Our study provides a mechanistic framework capable of
predicting future symptom improvement based on individual symptom-network
topology and clarifies the role of genetic and environmental risk as well as
resilience. Our control-theoretic framework makes testable, quantitative
predictions for individual therapeutic response and provides a starting-point
for the theory-driven design of personalized interventions.

Using a novel description of such backgrounds in terms of gravitating massive
particles, we compute classical wave scattering in terms of $2\to 2$ QFT
amplitudes in flat space, to all orders in spin. The results are Newman-Penrose
amplitudes which are in direct correspondence with solutions of the
Regge-Wheeler/Teukolsky equation. By introducing a precise prescription for the
point-particle limit, in Part I of this work we show how both agree for $h=0$
at finite values of the scattering angle and arbitrary spin orientation.
  Associated classical observables such as the scattering cross sections, wave
polarizations and time delay are studied at all orders in spin. The effect of
the black hole spin on the polarization and helicity of the waves is found in
agreement with previous analysis at linear order in spin. In the particular
limit of small scattering angle, we argue that wave scattering admits a
universal, point-particle description determined by the eikonal approximation.
We show how our results recover the scattering eikonal phase with spin up to
second post-Minkowskian order, and match it to the effective action of null
geodesics in a Kerr background. Using this correspondence we derive classical
observables such as polar and equatorial scattering angles.
  This study serves as a preceding analysis to Part II, where the Gravitational
Wave ($h=2$) case will be studied in detail.

developed that would account for this variation in order to estimate the
minimum detectable polarization (MDP). That method essentially required that
the position angles of individual events should be known precisely. In a
separate work, however, it was shown that using a machine learning method for
measuring event tracks can generate track angle uncertainties, which can be
used in the analysis. Here, the maximum likelihood method is used as a basis
for revising the estimate of the MDP in a general way that can include
uncertainties in event track position angles. The resultant MDP depends solely
upon the distribution of track angle uncertainties present in the input data.
Due to the physics of the IXPE detectors, it is possible to derive a simple
relationship between these angular uncertainties and the energy-dependent
modulation function as a step in the process.

September 2019 using the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph for around one hour.
Full-Stokes vectors were sampled in a 37 A window containing the Fe I 15648.52
A line (effective Lande g-factor of 3). The LOS magnetic field strength is
inferred using the strong-field approximation. The Stokes Inversion based on
Response functions code is used to gain a more complete understanding the
properties of the solar atmosphere at the locations of these oscillations.
Oscillations of more than 100 G are observed in the LOS magnetic field in the
period window 600-1272 s at three localised (>1""^2) regions. These oscillations
have coherence across individual regions indicating that jitter cannot account
for their occurrence. Longer-period amplitude variations, amplitudes over 200
G, are also detected but these have periods outside of the cone-of-influence.
Numerical inversions confirm both oscillations in the LOS magnetic field
strength at optical depths of around log-tau_5000=-0.5 (potentially caused by
compression) and other effects (e.g., changes in the optical depth or the
inclination of the field) may account for these changes. The oscillations in
the separations of the Stokes-V lobes of the 15648.52 A line appear to be solar
in nature. Future work will be required to understand whether these are truly

the phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters, which though have
phase boundaries that are in general curved lines, have the same topology as

values of the premultiplied energy spectra of direct numerical simulations. At
target time, the linear optimal perturbation is composed by oblique streaks,
which, for a sufficiently large initial energy, induce turbulence in the whole
domain, due to the lack of spatial localization. When localization is achieved
by adding nonlinear effects to the optimization, or by artificially confining
the linear optimal to a localized region in the spanwise direction, a
large-scale flow is created, which leads to the generation of a localised
turbulent band. These results suggest that inducing transition towards
turbulent bands in a tilted domain, two main elements are needed: a linear
energy growth mechanism such as the lift-up for generating large-amplitude flow
structures which produce inflection points; large-scale vortices ensuring
spatial localisation. Remarkably, these two elements alone are able to generate
an isolated turbulent band also in a large, non-tilted domain.

These phases typically grow monotonically with the SOC strength, as found in
Rashba quantum wires and rings. In this work we show that the spin-phase
gathering can be engineered by geometric means, viz. by the geometric curvature
of the circuits, to be non-monotonic. We demonstrate this peculiar property by
using one-dimensional polygonal models where flat segments alternate with
highly curved vertices. The complex interplay between dynamic and geometric
spin-phase components -- triggered by a series of emergent spin degeneracy
points -- leads to bounded, global spin phases. Moreover, we show that the

Aharonov-Casher conductance of Rashba loops, a connection that passed unnoticed

understand what dissonance and disbelief mean within conspiracy communities, we
first characterize their social imaginaries, a broad understanding of how
people collectively imagine their social existence. Focusing on 2K posts from
two image boards, 4chan and 8chan, and 1.2 M comments and posts from 12
subreddits dedicated to QAnon, we adopt a mixed methods approach to uncover the
symbolic language representing the movement, expectations, practices, heroes

computational framework for distinguishing belief and dissonance from general
discussion about QAnon. Further, analyzing user engagement with QAnon
conspiracy subreddits, we find that self-disclosures of dissonance correlate
with a significant decrease in user contributions and ultimately with their
departure from the community. We contribute a computational framework for
identifying dissonance self-disclosures and measuring the changes in user
engagement surrounding dissonance. Our work can provide insights into designing
dissonance-based interventions that can potentially dissuade conspiracists from

the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data based on Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN). Monochromatic $i$-band DES images with linear, logarithmic, and gradient
scales, matched with debiased visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo 1

including bright galaxies ($16\le{i}<18$) at low redshift ($z<0.25$), we
furthermore investigate the limit of the accuracy of our predictions applied to
galaxies at fainter magnitude and at higher redshifts. Our final catalogue
covers magnitudes $16\le{i}<21$, and redshifts $z<1.0$, and provides predicted
probabilities to two galaxy types -- Ellipticals and Spirals (disk galaxies).
Our CNN classifications reveal an accuracy of over 99\% for bright galaxies
when comparing with the GZ1 classifications ($i<18$). For fainter galaxies, the
visual classification carried out by three of the co-authors shows that the CNN
classifier correctly categorises disky galaxies with rounder and blurred
features, which humans often incorrectly visually classify as Ellipticals. As a
part of the validation, we carry out one of the largest examination of
non-parametric methods, including $\sim$100,000 galaxies with the same coverage
of magnitude and redshift as the training set from our catalogue. We find that

  Noise","23 pages, NeurIPS 2021",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Annealed importance sampling (AIS) and related algorithms are highly
effective tools for marginal likelihood estimation, but are not fully
differentiable due to the use of Metropolis-Hastings correction steps.
Differentiability is a desirable property as it would admit the possibility of
optimizing marginal likelihood as an objective using gradient-based methods. To
this end, we propose Differentiable AIS (DAIS), a variant of AIS which ensures
differentiability by abandoning the Metropolis-Hastings corrections. As a
further advantage, DAIS allows for mini-batch gradients. We provide a detailed
convergence analysis for Bayesian linear regression which goes beyond previous
analyses by explicitly accounting for the sampler not having reached
equilibrium. Using this analysis, we prove that DAIS is consistent in the
full-batch setting and provide a sublinear convergence rate. Furthermore,
motivated by the problem of learning from large-scale datasets, we study a
stochastic variant of DAIS that uses mini-batch gradients. Surprisingly,
stochastic DAIS can be arbitrarily bad due to a fundamental incompatibility
between the goals of last-iterate convergence to the posterior and elimination
of the accumulated stochastic error. This is in stark contrast with other
settings such as gradient-based optimization and Langevin dynamics, where the
effect of gradient noise can be washed out by taking smaller steps. This
indicates that annealing-based marginal likelihood estimation with stochastic
gradients may require new ideas.

energies of Li on top of 2D TMDs. We developed a universal representation with
few descriptors that take into account the intrinsic dipole moment and the
electronic structure of regular and Janus 2D layers, the side where the

particles in homogeneous turbulence with uniform shear and uniform stable
stratification are studied using direct numerical simulations. The Richardson
number is varied from $Ri=0$, corresponding to unstratified shear flow, to
$Ri=1$, corresponding to strongly stratified shear flow. The probability
density functions (pdfs) of both LA and EA have a stretched-exponential shape
and they show a strong and similar influence on the Richardson number. The
extreme values of the EA are stronger than those observed for the LA.
Geometrical statistics explain that the magnitude of the EA is larger than its
Lagrangian counterpart due to the mutual cancellation of the Eulerian and
convective acceleration, as both vectors statistically show an anti-parallel
preference. A wavelet-based scale-dependent decomposition of the LA and EA is
performed. The tails of the acceleration pdfs grow heavier for smaller scales
of turbulent motion. Hence the flatness increases with decreasing scale,
indicating stronger intermittency at smaller scales. The joint pdfs of the LA
and EA indicate a trend to stronger correlations with increasing Richardson
number and at larger scales of the turbulent motion. A consideration of the
terms in the Navier--Stokes equation shows that the LA is mainly determined by
the pressure-gradient term, while the EA is dominated by the nonlinear
convection term.

to enable native use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and DID-based secure

antiferromagnets (AFMs) were only discovered in the 1930s. The elusive nature
indicates AFMs' unique properties: At large scale, due to the absence of global
magnetization, AFMs may appear to behave like any non-magnetic material;
However, such a seemingly mundane macroscopic magnetic property is highly
nontrivial at microscopic level, where opposite spin alignment within the AFM
unit cell forms a rich internal structure. In topological AFMs, such an
internal structure leads to a new possibility, where topology and Berry phase
can acquire distinct spatial textures. Here, we study this exciting possibility
in an AFM Axion insulator, even-layered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ flakes, where spatial
degrees of freedom correspond to different layers. Remarkably, we report the
observation of a new type of Hall effect, the layer Hall effect, where
electrons from the top and bottom layers spontaneously deflect in opposite
directions. Specifically, under no net electric field, even-layered
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ shows no anomalous Hall effect (AHE); However, applying an
electric field isolates the response from one layer and leads to the surprising
emergence of a large layer-polarized AHE (~50%$\frac{e^2}{h}$). Such a layer
Hall effect uncovers a highly rare layer-locked Berry curvature, which serves
as a unique character of the space-time $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric AFM
topological insulator state. Moreover, we found that the layer-locked Berry
curvature can be manipulated by the Axion field, E$\cdot$B, which drives the
system between the opposite AFM states. Our results achieve previously
unavailable pathways to detect and manipulate the rich internal spatial
structure of fully-compensated topological AFMs. The layer-locked Berry
curvature represents a first step towards spatial engineering of Berry phase,
such as through layer-specific moir\'e potential.

behaviors like locomotion. While network architectures supporting sequence
generation vary considerably, a common feature is an abundance of inhibition.
In this work, we focus on architectures that support sequential activity in
recurrently connected networks with inhibition-dominated dynamics.
Specifically, we study emergent sequences in a special family of
threshold-linear networks, called combinatorial threshold-linear networks
(CTLNs), whose connectivity matrices are defined from directed graphs. Such
networks naturally give rise to an abundance of sequences whose dynamics are
tightly connected to the underlying graph. We find that architectures based on
generalizations of cycle graphs produce limit cycle attractors that can be
activated to generate transient or persistent (repeating) sequences. Each
architecture type gives rise to an infinite family of graphs that can be built
from arbitrary component subgraphs. Moreover, we prove a number of graph rules
for the corresponding CTLNs in each family. The graph rules allow us to
strongly constrain, and in some cases fully determine, the fixed points of the
network in terms of the fixed points of the component subnetworks. Finally, we
also show how the structure of certain architectures gives insight into the
sequential dynamics of the corresponding attractor.

activities. Infrared and sub-millimeter images show the presence of at least
two large-scale dust filaments extended toward the LBN sources. The Herschel

distribution of molecular gas at [-42.7, -34.4] km/s traces the cloud
associated with the Y-feature, and confirms the existence of filaments. The
large-scale filaments appear to be possibly spatially twisted. There is a hint
of an oscillatory-like velocity pattern along both the filaments, favouring
their proposed twisted nature. It is the first study showing the possible
twisting of filaments, which is more prominent in the northern and central

Bjorken expansion. We use the concept of `free-streaming fixed lines' for
scaled shear and bulk stresses in non-conformal kinetic theory and
hydrodynamics, and show that these `fixed lines' behave as early-time
attractors and repellors of the evolution. In the conformal limit, the
free-streaming fixed lines reduce to the well-known fixed points of conformal
Bjorken dynamics. A new fixed point in the free streaming regime is identified
which lies at the intersection of these fixed lines. Contrary to the conformal
scenario, both kinetic theory and hydrodynamics predict the absence of
attractor behavior in the normalised shear stress channel. In kinetic theory a
far-off-equilibrium attractor is found for the normalised effective
longitudinal pressure, driven by rapid longitudinal expansion. Second-order
viscous hydrodynamics fails to accurately describe this attractor. From a
thorough analysis of the free-streaming dynamics in Chapman-Enskog
hydrodynamics we conclude that this failure results from an inaccurate
approximation of the fixed lines and a related incorrect description of the
nature of the fixed point. A modified anisotropic hydrodynamic description is
presented that provides excellent agreement with kinetic theory results and
reproduces the far-from-equilibrium attractor for the scaled longitudinal
pressure.

and the L1 spacecraft, spanning a longitudinal range of 222{\deg} in the
ecliptic plane, observed an energetic particle flux increase. The widespread
solar energetic particle (SEP) event was associated with a coronal mass
ejection (CME) that came from a region located near the far-side central
meridian from Earth's perspective. The CME erupted in two stages, and was
accompanied by a late M-class flare observed as a post-eruptive arcade,
persisting low-frequency (interplanetary) type II and groups of
shock-accelerated type III radio bursts, all of them making this SEP event
unusual. Aims: There are two main objectives of this study, disentangling the
reasons for the different intensity-time profiles observed by the spacecraft,
especially at MESSENGER and STEREO-A locations, longitudinally separated by
only 15{\deg}, and unravelling the single solar source related with the
widespread SEP event. Results: The solar source associated with the widespread
SEP event is the shock driven by the CME, as the flare observed as a
post-eruptive arcade is too late to explain the estimated particle onset. The
different intensity-time profiles observed by STEREO-A, located at 0.97 au, and
MESSENGER, at 0.33 au, can be interpreted as enhanced particle scattering
beyond Mercury's orbit. The longitudinal extent of the shock does not explain
by itself the wide spread of particles in the heliosphere. The particle
increase observed at L1 may be attributed to cross-field diffusion transport,
and this is also the case for STEREO-B, at least until the spacecraft is
eventually magnetically connected to the shock when it reaches ~0.6 au.

extending it to longer periods than previously reachable. We gathered 6104
spectra of 377 stars between 1981 and 2021, and merged our radial velocities
with 1151 measurements from an independent survey by others started three years
earlier. With the combined data spanning more than 43 yr we have determined
orbits for some 30 new binary and multiple systems, more than doubling the
number previously known in the Pleiades. The longest period is 36.5 yr. A dozen
additional objects display long-term trends in their velocities, implying even
longer periods. We examine the collection of orbital elements for cluster
members, and find that the shape of the incompleteness-corrected distribution
of periods (up to $10^4$ days) is similar to that of solar-type binaries in the
field, while that of the eccentricities is different. The mass-ratio
distribution is consistent with being flat. The binary frequency in the
Pleiades for periods up to $10^4$ days is $25 \pm 3$%, after corrections for
undetected binaries, which is nearly double that of the field up to the same
period. The total binary frequency including known astrometric binaries is at
least 57%. We estimate the internal radial velocity dispersion in the cluster
to be $0.48 \pm 0.04$ km s$^{-1}$. We revisit the determination of the tidal
circularization period, and confirm its value to be $7.2 \pm 1.0$ days, with an
improved precision compared to an earlier estimate.

The velocity dispersion of the Milky Way determines a coherence time of about

stochastically. Any analysis of data from an axion direct detection experiment
must carefully account for this stochastic behavior to properly interpret the

the axion field that are unable to collect data for many coherence times.
Indeed, the direction, in addition to the amplitude, of the axion field

computationally efficient methods for performing likelihood-based data

the spin direction as well as the interlayer correlations. Moreover, we
performed numerical calculations using the doped Hubbard model to explain the

consider a composite fermion operator, consisting of a conduction electron

scales as $e^{-W/J_k}$ with $W$ the bandwidth and $J_k$ the Kondo coupling, the

$J_k/W = 0.18$, does not destroy the heavy quasiparticle. We furthermore
investigate the spectral function of the composite fermion in the ground state

model, as well as for ferromagnetic Kondo couplings, and compare our results to
analytical calculations in the limit of high temperatures, large-$N$,

desired functionality, independent of the underlying physical structure. The
kind of entanglement to be stored is chosen to fulfill all desired network
requests (i.e. parallel bipartite or multipartite communications between
specific nodes chosen from some finite set), but in such a way that the storage
requirement is minimized. This can be accomplished by using multipartite
entangled states shared between network nodes that can be transformed by local
operations to different target states. We introduce a clustering algorithm to
identify connected clusters in the network for a given desired functionality,
i.e. the required network topology of the entanglement-based network, and a
merging algorithm that constructs multipartite entangled resource states with
reduced memory requirement to fulfill all desired network requests. This leads
to a significant reduction in required time and resources, and provides a
powerful tool to design quantum networks that is unique to entanglement-based
networks.

surface layers, where gas temperature distributions allow radially stratified
fluorescence from the two species. We calculate empirical emitting radii for
each species under the assumption that the line widths are entirely set by
Keplerian broadening, demonstrating that the CO fluorescence originates further
from the stars (r ~ 20 AU) than the H2 (r ~ 0.8 AU). This is supported by 2-D
radiative transfer models, which show that the peak and outer radii of the CO
flux distributions generally extend further into the outer disk than the H2.
These results also indicate that additional sources of LyA photons remain
unaccounted for, requiring more complex models to fully reproduce the molecular
gas emission. As a first step, we confirm that the morphologies of the UV-CO
bands and LyA radiation fields are significantly correlated and discover that
both trace the degree of dust disk evolution. The UV tracers appear to follow
the same sequence of disk evolution as forbidden line emission from jets and
winds, as the observed LyA profiles transition between dominant red wing and
dominant blue wing shapes when the high-velocity optical emission disappears.
Our results suggest a scenario where UV radiation fields, disk winds and jets,

be experimentally validated before implementation, which is expensive and
time-consuming. In this paper, we have utilized machine learning algorithms to
predict device reliability, significantly reducing the need for conducting
experiments. To train the models, we have tested 224 power devices from 10
different manufacturers. First, we describe a method to process the data for
modeling purposes. Based on the in-house testing data, we implemented various
ML models and observed that computational models such as Gradient Boosting and
LSTM encoder-decoder networks can predict power device failure with high
accuracy.

gone through a phase of early matter domination (EMD) which enhanced the growth
of small-scale dark matter structure. If EMD was long enough, self-gravitating
objects formed prior to reheating. We study the evolution of these dense early
halos (EHs) through reheating. At the end of EMD, EHs undergo rapid expansion
and eventually eject their matter. We find that this process washes out
structure on scales much larger than naively expected from the size of the
original halos. We compute the density profiles of the EH remnants and use them
to construct late-time power spectra that include these non-linear effects. EH
dynamics limits the maximum enhancement that can be generated by EMD in a way
that is independent of the dark matter microphysics. We evolve an extrapolated
$\Lambda$CDM power spectrum to estimate the properties of microhalos that would
form after matter-radiation equality. Surprisingly, cosmologies with a short
period of EMD lead to an earlier onset of microhalo formation compared to those
with a long period of EMD. In either case, dark matter structure formation
begins much earlier than in the standard cosmology, with most DM bound in
microhalos.

multiple access points (APs) actively cooperate to serve users' equipment
(UEs). We consider how the random access (RA) problem can be addressed by such
a network under the occurrence of pilot collisions. To find a solution, we
embrace the user-centric perspective, which basically dictates that only a
preferred set of APs needs to serve a UE. Due to the success of the
strongest-user collision resolution (SUCRe) protocol for cellular (Ce) mMIMO,
we extend it by considering the new setting. Besides, we establish that the
user-centric perspective naturally equips a CF network with robust fundamentals
for resolving collisions. We refer to this foundation as spatial separability,
which enables multiple colliding UEs to access the network simultaneously. We
then propose two novel RA protocols for CF-mMIMO: i) the baseline cell-free
(BCF) that resolves collisions with the concept of spatial separability alone,
and ii) the cell-free SUCRe (CF-SUCRe) that combines SUCRe and spatial
separability principle to resolve collisions. We evaluate our proposed RA
protocols against the Ce-SUCRe. Respectively, the BCF and CF-SUCRe can support
7x and 4x more UEs' access on average compared to the Ce-SUCRe with an average
energy efficiency gain based on total power consumed (TPC) by the network per
access attempt of 52x and 340x. Among our procedures, even with a higher
overhead, the CF-SUCRe is superior to BCF regarding TPC per access attempt.
This is because the combination of methods for collision resolution allows many
APs to be disconnected from the RA process without sacrificing much the
performance. Finally, our numerical results presented in this work can be
reproduced using the code package available on:

Little is known about how $a_n$ changes as $n$ grows, unless $\phi$ is a power

  The difficulty of understanding $a_n$ in general is that
$\mathbb{P}^1(\F_{q^n})$ is a finite set with no ambient geometry. In fact,
$\phi$ can be lifted to a PCF rational map on the Riemann sphere, where we show

possible directions of the velocity that satisfy the energy equation. A linear
momentum function is defined that integrates to zero, and this property is
consistent with the expectation value of the linear momentum for stationary
states with real-valued wave functions. The energy equation is integrated to
obtain a version of the well known energy equation involving reduced density
matrices, where the kinetic energy functional of the one-particle density
matrix is replaced by a function of the electron density and a velocity
function. Also, the noninteracting kinetic energy functional from the

be confirmed, then the cluster would be significantly fainter and more compact

convenient development of both active learning experiments and applications.
With the objective of making various classifiers and query strategies
accessible for active learning, small-text integrates several well-known
machine learning libraries, namely scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Hugging Face
transformers. The latter integrations are optionally installable extensions, so
GPUs can be used but are not required. Using this new library, we investigate
the performance of the recently published SetFit training paradigm, which we

of a quantum mechanical wavefunction that is a real-valued eigenvector of a
time-independent, one-body Schroedinger equation, satisfies a compressible-flow
generalization of the Bernoulli equation, where the mass density is the
probability density times the mass of the system; the pressure and velocity
fields are defined by functions depending on the probability density, and the
gradient and the Laplacian of the probability density, where there are two
possible directions of the velocity on a streamline. The velocity given
definition implies a generalization of the steady-flow continuity equation
where mass is not locally conserved. The gradient of the Bernoullian equation
is demonstrated to be equivalent to the steady flow Euler equation for variable
mass and irrotational flow. A speed of sound quadratic equation is obtained
from a spherical wave-pulse. One of the solutions indicates that the wave-pulse
velocity on a streamline is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction of the
fluid velocity on the streamline. The other solution is the focus of attention
from that point on. It is proven that the extremums of the momentum per volume
on a streamline occur at points that are Mach 1 speed. The developed formalism
is applied to a particle in a one-dimensional box, the ground and first
excited-states of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, and the hydrogen 1s
and 2s states. Some behavior is repeated in all the applications examined. For
example, an antinode, a point of local-maximum density, has zero velocity and
zero Mach speed on the streamline, while a node, a point of minimum density,
has infinite velocity and Mach 2. In between the node and antinode is an
extremum of the momentum, and Mach 1. (This is a short version of the

factors. For Australia, we estimate the emission for each coal mine by
distributing the state-level reported total emissions using proxies of coal
production and the coal basin-specific gas content profile of underground
mines. Comparison of our total coal mine methane emission from India with

Maxwellian for a class of kinetic Fokker-Planck-Alignment equations arising in
the studies of collective behavior. Unlike previously known results in this
direction that focus on convergence near Maxwellian, our result is global for
hydrodynamically dense flocks, which has several consequences. In particular,
if communication is long-range, the convergence is unconditional. If
communication is local then all nearly aligned flocks quantified by smallness
of the Fisher information relax to the Maxwellian. In the latter case the class
of initial data is stable under the vanishing noise limit, i.e.\ it reduces to
a non-trivial and natural class of traveling wave solutions to the noiseless
Vlasov-Alignment equation.
  The main novelty in our approach is the adaptation of a mollified Favre
filtration of the macroscopic momentum into the communication protocol. Such
filtration has been used previously in large eddy simulations of compressible
turbulence and its new variant appeared in the proof of the Onsager conjecture
for inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system. A rigorous treatment of well-posedness
for smooth solutions is provided. Lastly, we prove that in the limit of strong

Maxwellialize to solutions of the macroscopic hydrodynamic system with the

We provide sufficient
conditions under which the optimal mechanism can be implemented via upgrade

Our approach exploits duality methods to identify conditions on the
distribution of consumer types under which (a) each product is purchased by the
same set of buyers as under separate monopoly pricing (though the transfers can
be different), and (b) these sets are nested.
  We exhibit two distinct sets of sufficient conditions. The first set of
conditions is given by a weak version of monotonicity of types and virtual
values, while maintaining a regularity assumption, i.e., that the
product-by-product revenue curves are single-peaked. The second set of
conditions establishes the optimality of upgrade pricing for type spaces with
monotone marginal rates of substitution (MRS) -- the relative preference ratios
for any two products are monotone across types. The monotone MRS condition
allows us to relax the earlier regularity assumption.
  Under both sets of conditions, we fully characterize the product bundles and
prices that form the optimal upgrade pricing menu. Finally, we show that, if
the consumer's types are monotone, the seller can equivalently post a vector of
single-item prices: upgrade pricing and separate pricing are equivalent.

field can sustain a stable anisotropy in the downstream, triggering a departure
from the expected MHD behavior. In a recent work [A. Bret and R. Narayan, J.

actors and dimensions of events observed in the text. These event ontologies
still have some shortcomings such as covering only a few topics like political
events, having inflexible structure in defining argument roles and insufficient

defined to capture various dimensions of events. In a follow-up experiment, the
proposed ontology is evaluated on Wikipedia events, and it is shown to be
general and comprehensive. Moreover, in order to facilitate the preparation of
gold-standard data for event extraction, a language-independent online tool is

is also prepared consisting 24K news articles in Persian language. Finally, we
present a supervised method based on deep learning techniques to automatically

useful results in physics. However, if one reads the majority of standard texts
and literature on the application of Noether's first theorem to field theory,
one immediately finds that the ``canonical Noether energy-momentum tensor""
derived from the 4-parameter translation of the Poincar\'e group does not
correspond to what's widely accepted as the ``physical'' energy-momentum tensor
for central theories such as electrodynamics. This gives the impression that
Noether's first theorem is in some sense not working. In recognition of this
issue, common practice is to ``improve"" the canonical Noether energy-momentum
tensor by adding suitable ad-hoc ``improvement"" terms that will convert the
canonical expression into the desired result. On the other hand, a less common
but distinct method developed by Bessel-Hagen considers gauge symmetries as
well as coordinate symmetries when applying Noether's first theorem; this
allows one to uniquely derive the accepted physical energy-momentum tensor
without the need for any ad-hoc improvement terms in theories with exactly
gauge invariant actions. $\dots$ Using the converse of Noether's first theorem,
we show that the Bessel-Hagen type transformations are uniquely selected in the
case of electrodynamics, which powerfully dissolves the methodological

partly due to the fact that the spinal cord is surrounded by a number of

inhomogeneities in the magnetic field, which in turn lead to image artifacts.
In order to address this issue, linear compensation gradients can be employed.
The latter can be generated using an MRI scanner's first order gradient coils
and adjusted on a per-slice basis, in order to correct for through-plane (""z"")
magnetic field gradients. This approach is referred to as z-shimming. The aim
of this study is two-fold. The first aim was to replicate aspects of a previous
study wherein z-shimming was found to improve image quality in T2*-weighted
echo-planar imaging. Our second aim was to improve upon the z-shimming approach
by including in-plane compensation gradients and adjusting the compensation
gradients during the image acquisition process so that they take into account
respiration-induced magnetic field variations. We refer to this novel approach
as realtime dynamic shimming. Measurements performed in a group of 12 healthy
volunteers at 3 T show improved signal homogeneity along the spinal cord when
using z-shimming. Signal homogeneity may be further improved by including
realtime compensation for respiration-induced field gradients and by also doing
this for gradients along the in-plane axes.

motivation from the seminal work by Attouch and Cabot on relaxed inertial
methods for monotone inclusions and present a stochastic extension of the
relaxed inertial forward-backward-forward (RISFBF) method. Facilitated by an
online variance reduction strategy via a mini-batch approach, we show that
(RISFBF) produces a sequence that weakly converges to the solution set.
Moreover, it is possible to estimate the rate at which the discrete velocity of
the stochastic process vanishes. Under strong monotonicity, we demonstrate
strong convergence, and give a detailed assessment of the iteration and oracle
complexity of the scheme. When the mini-batch is raised at a geometric
(polynomial) rate, the rate statement can be strengthened to a linear (suitable
polynomial) rate while the oracle complexity of computing an
$\epsilon$-solution improves to $O(1/\epsilon)$. Importantly, the latter claim
allows for possibly biased oracles, a key theoretical advancement allowing for
far broader applicability. By defining a restricted gap function based on the
Fitzpatrick function, we prove that the expected gap of an averaged sequence
diminishes at a sublinear rate of $O(1/k)$ while the oracle complexity of
computing a suitably defined $\epsilon$-solution is $O(1/\epsilon^{1+a})$ where
$a>1$. Numerical results on two-stage games and an overlapping group Lasso

meteor energy deposition could explain, in part, two of these anomalies. Our

changes in all three as our meteors descend into a realistic Titan atmosphere.
For the smallest particles, which deliver the most mass and therefore energy to

those of the observed chemical anomalies. In the region directly above the
anomalies, energy deposition by meteors is greater than energy deposition from
ultraviolet photons, which are typically responsible for methane dissociation.
Finally, we calculate the total amount of energy available for chemical

ultraviolet light, but of course is the dominant source of energy for
atmospheric chemistry at the relevant altitudes during the night.

whose knowledge is vital to correctly plan medical laser treatments. To perform
the estimation, we utilize an implementation of the Ensemble Kalman Filter

on observations of the tissue thermal response to laser irradiation. This
method has the potential for straightforward implementation in a clinical
setup, as it would only require a simple thermal sensor, e.g., a miniaturized

during laser exposure, we employ a variant of EnKF capable of tracking
time-varying parameters. Through simulated experimental studies, we demonstrate
the ability of the proposed technique to identify the tissue optical properties
and track their dynamic changes during laser exposure, while simultaneously
tracking changes in the tissue temperature at locations beneath the surface. We
further demonstrate the framework's capability in estimating additional unknown
tissue properties (i.e., the volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity)

mild conditions on the error term. In particular, we only assume that the error
distribution has a finite p-th moment with p greater than one. We also show
that the deep robust regression estimators are able to circumvent the curse of

approximate lower-dimensional set. An important feature of our error bound is
that, for ReLU neural networks with network width and network size (number of

predictor, our excess risk bounds depend sub-linearly on d. Our assumption
relaxes the exact manifold support assumption, which could be restrictive and
unrealistic in practice. We also relax several crucial assumptions on the data

properties of an intriguing family of strange planar attractors. Building
towards these results, we first show that any generic Lebesgue measure
preserving map $f$ generates the pseudo-arc as inverse limit with $f$ as a
single bonding map. These maps can be realized as attractors of disc
homeomorphisms in such a way that the attractors vary continuously (in
Hausdorff distance on the disc) with the change of bonding map as a parameter.
Furthermore, for generic Lebesgue measure preserving maps $f$ the background
Oxtoby-Ulam measures induced by Lebesgue measure for $f$ on the interval are
physical on the disc and in addition there is a dense set of maps $f$ defining
a unique physical measure. Moreover, the family of physical measures on the
attractors varies continuously in the weak* topology; i.e. the parametrized
family is statistically stable. We also find an arc in the generic Lebesgue
measure preserving set of maps and construct a family of disk homeomorphisms
parametrized by this arc which induces a continuously varying family of

gives rise to derivative logics, also referred to as $d$-logics. Unlike logics
based on the topological closure operator, $d$-logics have not previously been
studied in the framework of dynamical systems, which are pairs $(X,f)$
consisting of a topological space $X$ equipped with a continuous function
$f\colon X\to X$. We introduce the logics $\bf{wK4C}$, $\bf{K4C}$ and
$\bf{GLC}$ and show that they all have the finite Kripke model property and are
sound and complete with respect to the $d$-semantics in this dynamical setting.
In particular, we prove that $\bf{wK4C}$ is the $d$-logic of all dynamic
topological systems, $\bf{K4C}$ is the $d$-logic of all $T_D$ dynamic
topological systems, and $\bf{GLC}$ is the $d$-logic of all dynamic topological
systems based on a scattered space. We also prove a general result for the case
where $f$ is a homeomorphism, which in particular yields soundness and
completeness for the corresponding systems $\bf{wK4H}$, $\bf{K4H}$ and
$\bf{GLH}$. The main contribution of this work is the foundation of a general
proof method for finite model property and completeness of dynamic topological
$d$-logics. Furthermore, our result for $\bf{GLC}$ constitutes the first step
towards a proof of completeness for the trimodal topo-temporal language with
respect to a finite axiomatisation -- something known to be impossible over the

awareness for distributed autonomous robots (DARs). The uncertainty propagation
over a task-allocation process is done by using the Unscented transform that
uses the Sigma-Point sampling mechanism. It has great potential to be employed
for generic task-allocation schemes, in the sense that there is no need to
modify an existing task-allocation method that has been developed without
considering the uncertainty in the situational awareness. The proposed
framework was tested in a simulated environment where the decision-maker needs
to determine an optimal allocation of multiple locations assigned to multiple
mobile flying robots whose locations come as random variables of known mean and

estimate of subsurface conductivity that has blurred boundaries, damped

expected conductivity structure is well constrained in some parts of the
subsurface, but incorporating prior information in the inversion is not a
trivial task. In this study we developed an electrical resistivity tomography
inversion algorithm that combines parametric and smooth inversion strategies.
In regions where the subsurface is well constrained, the model was
parameterized with only a few variables, while the rest of the subsurface was
parameterized with voxels. We tested this hybrid inversion strategy on two
synthetic models that contained a well constrained highly resistive or
conductive near-surface horizontal layer and a target beneath. In each testing
scenario, the hybrid inversion improved resolution of feature boundaries and
magnitudes and had fewer inversion artifacts than the standard smooth
inversion. A sensitivity analysis showed that the hybrid inversion successfully
recovered subsurface features when a range of regularization parameters,
initial models, and data noise levels were tested. The hybrid inversion
strategy can potentially be expanded to a range of applications including
marine surveys, permafrost/frozen ground studies, urban geophysics, or anywhere
that prior information allows part of the model to be constrained with simple

performance by race, yet there is no known correlation for race on medical
imaging that would be obvious to the human expert interpreting the images.
  Methods: Using private and public datasets we evaluate: A) performance
quantification of deep learning models to detect race from medical images,
including the ability of these models to generalize to external environments
and across multiple imaging modalities, B) assessment of possible confounding
anatomic and phenotype population features, such as disease distribution and
body habitus as predictors of race, and C) investigation into the underlying
mechanism by which AI models can recognize race.
  Findings: Standard deep learning models can be trained to predict race from
medical images with high performance across multiple imaging modalities. Our
findings hold under external validation conditions, as well as when models are
optimized to perform clinically motivated tasks. We demonstrate this detection
is not due to trivial proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race,
such as underlying disease distribution. Finally, we show that performance
persists over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrum of the images
suggesting that mitigation efforts will be challenging and demand further
study.
  Interpretation: We emphasize that model ability to predict self-reported race
is itself not the issue of importance. However, our findings that AI can
trivially predict self-reported race -- even from corrupted, cropped, and
noised medical images -- in a setting where clinical experts cannot, creates an
enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging: if an AI model
secretly used its knowledge of self-reported race to misclassify all Black
patients, radiologists would not be able to tell using the same data the model
has access to.

tweezer that collects samples of the signals at very low sampling rates, and
each sample is short enough to maintain the statistical properties of the
signals. The low sampling frequency reduces the workloads of the analog to
digital conversion and digital signal processing systems. In the meantime, the
short pulse sampling maintains the accuracy of the sampled signals, so the
statistical properties of the undersampling signals are the same as the
statistical properties of the original signals. With the optical pulses
generated from a mode-locked laser, the optical pulse sampling system is able
to process and separate mixed signals with bandwidth over 100GHz and achieves a

detailed understanding of backreaction due to quantum fields. We investigate
this problem in semi-classical Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where the
spacetime is the eternal two-dimensional Anti-de Sitter ($\text{AdS}_{2}$)

central charge $c$, and backreaction effects may be analyzed exactly. We show
the Wald entropy of the semi-classical JT theory entirely encapsulates the
generalized entropy - including time-dependent von Neumann entropy
contributions - whose extremization leads to a QES lying just outside of the
black hole horizon. Consequently, the QES defines a Rindler wedge nested inside
the enveloping black hole. We use covariant phase space techniques on a
time-reflection symmetric slice to derive a Smarr relation and first law of
nested Rindler wedge thermodynamics, regularized using local counterterms, and
including semi-classical effects. Moreover, in the microcanonical ensemble the
semi-classical first law implies the generalized entropy of the QES is
stationary at fixed energy. Thus, the thermodynamics of the nested Rindler
wedge is equivalent to thermodynamics of the QES in the microcanonical
ensemble.

suprasystemic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and right ventricular (RV)
failure. PS, however, can result in poorly understood mortality. Here, a
patient-specific geometrical multiscale model of PAH physiology and PS is
developed for a paediatric PAH patient with stent-based PS. In the model,
7.6mm-diameter PS produces near-equalisation of the aortic and PA pressures and
Qp/Qs (oxygenated vs deoxygenated blood flow) ratio of 0.72 associated with a
16% decrease of left ventricular (LV) output and 18% increase of RV output. The
flow from LV to aortic arch branches increases by 16%, while LV contribution to
the lower body flow decreases by 29%. Total flow in the descending aorta (DAo)
increases by 18% due to RV contribution through the PS with flow into the
distal PA branches decreasing. PS induces 18% increase of RV work due to its
larger stroke volume pumped against lower afterload. Nonetheless, larger RV
work does not lead to increased RV end-diastolic volume. Three-dimensional flow
assessment demonstrates the PS jet impinging with a high velocity and wall
shear stress on the opposite DAo wall with the most of the shunt flow being
diverted to the DAo. Increasing the PS diameter from 5mm up to 10mm results in
nearly linear decrease in post-operative Qp/Qs ratio. In conclusion, this model
reasonably represents patient-specific haemodynamics pre- and post-creation of
the PS, providing insights into physiology of this complex condition, and
presents a predictive tool that could be useful for clinical decision-making
regarding suitability for reversed PS in PAH patients with drug-resistant
suprasystemic PAH.

relevance in the insurance literature. This kind of data often exhibits
positive skewness and heavy tails. In this work, we propose a new quantile
regression model based on the scale-mixture Birnbaum-Saunders distribution for
modeling personal accident insurance data. The maximum likelihood estimates of
the model parameters are obtained via the EM algorithm. Two Monte Carlo
simulation studies are performed using the R software. The first study aims to
analyze the performances of the EM algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood
estimates, and the randomized quantile and generalized Cox-Snell residuals. In
the second simulation study, the size and power of the the Wald, likelihood
ratio, score and gradient tests are evaluated. The two simulation studies are
conducted considering different quantiles of interest and sample sizes.
Finally, a real insurance data set is analyzed to illustrate the proposed
approach.

are shaped by the conditions of gas in the interstellar medium (ISM). In situ
measurements of turbulent density fluctuations near stellar bow shocks are only
achievable with a few observational probes, including H$\alpha$ emitting bow
shocks and the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM). In this paper, we examine
density variations around the Guitar Nebula, an H$\alpha$ bow shock associated
with PSR B2224$+$65, in tandem with density variations probed by VIM near the
boundary of the solar wind and ISM. High-resolution Hubble Space Telescope
observations of the Guitar Nebula taken between 1994 and 2006 trace density
variations over scales from 100s to 1000s of au, while VIM density measurements
made with the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave System constrain variations from 1000s of
meters to 10s of au. The power spectrum of density fluctuations constrains the
amplitude of the turbulence wavenumber spectrum near the Guitar Nebula to ${\rm

probed by Voyager ${\rm log}_{10}C_{\rm n}^2 = -1.57\pm0.02$ m$^{-20/3}$.
Spectral amplitudes obtained from multi-epoch observations of four other
H$\alpha$ bow shocks also show significant enhancements in $C_{\rm n}^2$ from
values that are considered typical for the diffuse, warm ionized medium,
suggesting that density fluctuations near these bow shocks may be amplified by
shock interactions with the surrounding medium, or by selection effects that
favor H$\alpha$ emission from bow shocks embedded in denser media.

analyses the most critical model risk factors, meant as those to which XVA are
most sensitive, finding an acceptable compromise between accuracy and
performance. This task has been conducted in a complete context including a
market standard multi-curve G2++ model calibrated on real market data, both
Variation Margin and ISDA-SIMM dynamic Initial Margin, different
collateralization schemes, and the most common linear and non-linear interest
rates derivatives. Moreover, we considered an alternative analytical approach
for XVA in case of uncollateralized Swaps. We show that a crucial element is
the construction of a parsimonious time grid capable of capturing all
periodical spikes arising in collateralized exposure during the Margin Period
of Risk. To this end, we propose a workaround to efficiently capture all

hyperplanes that covers every point of the Boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$ except one
must contain at least $n$ hyperplanes. We obtain two extensions of this result,
in characteristic zero, for hyperplane covers of symmetric sets of the Boolean
cube (subsets that are closed under permutations of coordinates), as well as
for `polynomial covers' of `weight-determined' sets of `strictly unimodal
uniform' (SU$^2$) grids.
  As a main tool for solving our problems, we give a combinatorial
characterization of (finite-degree) Zariski (Z-) closures of symmetric sets of
the Boolean cube -- the Z-closure of a symmetric set is symmetric. In fact, we
obtain a characterization that concerns, more generally, weight-determined sets
of SU$^2$ grids. However, in this generality, our characterization is not of
the Z-closures -- unlike over the Boolean cube, the Z-closure of a
weight-determined set need not be weight-determined. We introduce a new closure
operator exclusively for weight-determined sets -- the `(finite-degree)
Z*-closure' -- defined to be the maximal weight-determined set in the
Z-closure. (This coincides with the Z-closure over the Boolean cube, for
symmetric sets.) We obtain a combinatorial characterization of the
finite-degree Z*-closures of weight-determined sets of an SU$^2$ grid. This
characterization may also be of independent interest. Indeed, as further
applications, we (i) give an alternate proof of a lemma by Alon et al. (IEEE
Trans. Inform. Theory, 1988), and (ii) characterize the `certifying degrees' of
weight-determined sets.
  Over the Boolean cube, our above characterization can also be derived using a
result of Bernasconi and Egidi (Inf. Comput., 1999). However, our proof is
independent of this result, works for all SU$^2$ grids, and could be regarded
as being more combinatorial.

system size, and is tailored to correctly account for the errors most likely to
occur in experiments. For one-dimensional cluster states, the constructed
fidelity measure is tight to lowest order in the error probability for
experimentally realistic noise sources and thus closely matches the true
fidelity. Furthermore, it is tight for the majority of higher-order errors,
except for a small subset of certain non-local multiqubit errors irrelevant in

higher-dimensional cluster states, including correctly the majority of

BKT phase transition in a 2D degenerate Fermi gas with an imaginary Zeeman

$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry guarantees that the superfluid density and many other

superfluid density, yielding higher BKT transition temperature than that in
Hermitian systems. In the weak interaction region, the transition temperature
can be much larger than that in the strong interaction limit. Our work
showcases a surprising interplay between low-dimensional topological defects

framework, several evacuation assistants are established to observe the partial
information of pedestrians' location and adjust the guiding signals of the
dynamic guiding assistant systems. A simple on-off-based density control
algorithm is proposed for the evacuation assistants according to the delayed
data of the observed information (i.e., pedestrian densities in the observed
regions near the corresponding exits). This paper provides strategic
suggestions on how to set the observed region and the target density by
involving a force-driven cellular automaton model. It is observed that the
proposed density control algorithm can control (positively affect) the global
distribution of the pedestrians' locations and suppress arching phenomena in
the evacuation process even using the observed partial information under time
delays. By imposing a moderate target density, the dynamic guiding assistant
system also suppresses the triggers of collisions around the exits and avoids
inefficiently separating the pedestrians. To enhance evacuation efficiency, we
reveal an interesting fact without loss of generality that we only need to
observe the pedestrians' location from a small region near the exit instead of
a large region when the time delay of the observed information is slight
enough. Our numerical findings are expected to provide new insights into
designing computer-aided guiding strategies in real evacuations.

policy iteration algorithms, specifically designed for sequential zero-sum
games and minimax problems with a general structure. Aside from greater
generality, the advantage of our algorithms over alternatives is that they
resolve some long-standing convergence difficulties of the ""natural"" policy
iteration algorithm, which have been known since the Pollatschek and Avi-Itzhak
method [PoA69] for finite-state Markov games. Mathematically, this ""natural""
algorithm is a form of Newton's method for solving Bellman's equation, but
Newton's method, contrary to the case of single-player DP problems, is not
globally convergent in the case of a minimax problem, because the Bellman
operator may have components that are neither convex nor concave. Our
algorithms address this difficulty by introducing alternating player choices,
and by using a policy-dependent mapping with a uniform sup-norm contraction
property, similar to earlier works by Bertsekas and Yu [BeY10], [BeY12],
[YuB13]. Moreover, our algorithms allow a convergent and highly parallelizable
implementation, which is based on state space partitioning, and distributed
asynchronous policy evaluation and policy improvement operations within each
set of the partition. Our framework is also suitable for the use of
reinforcement learning methods based on aggregation, which may be useful for
large-scale problem instances.

we show several findings in a situation where both defense and attack compete

performance of power SiC MOSFETs. Knowledge of the exact values for the ITCs is
required in order to perform accurate and predictive compact model simulations
of their dynamic performance. Since commercial SiC MOSFETs are capable of
operating in a wide range of temperatures, it is important to know the values
of ITCs in the whole temperature range of operation. Direct measurements of the
ITCs with standard equipment is possible only at low current levels (i.e. in
the off-state (Vgs < Vth) for Vds > 0 V), however their values in the on-state
(Vgs>Vth) also influence the MOSFETs switching performance. In this work, ITCs
of a planar SiC MOSFET in the on-state are studied by the means of a calibrated
TCAD model, revealing substantial temperature dependence in the range of
300-450 K. In the first approximation, this temperature dependence of the ITCs
can be explained by a weaker temperature dependence of the MOSFET channel
resistance in comparison to its JFET and epitaxial layer resistances. In
addition, it is shown that at high frequencies stray inductances of the
TO-247-3 package result in a change of the extracted values of the on-state
ITCs. This effect is already notable at 1 MHz.

transport phenomena and provide a promising platform for wide applications like
biosensors, as shown in recent electrochemical experiments. Here, we study
charge transport in a multi-terminal DNA tetrahedron, finding that its charge
transport properties strongly depend upon the interplay among contact position,
on-site energy disorder, and base-pair mismatch. Our results indicate that the
charge transport efficiency is nearly independent of contact position in the
weak disorder regime, and is dramatically declined by the occurrence of a
single base-pair mismatch between the source and the drain, in accordance with
experimental results [J. Am. Chem. Soc. {\bf 134}, 13148 (2012); Chem. Sci.
{\bf 9}, 979 (2018)]. By contrast, the charge transport efficiency could be
enhanced monotonically by shifting the source toward the drain in the strong
disorder regime, and be increased when the base-pair mismatch takes place
exactly at the contact position. In particular, when the source moves
successively from the top vertex to the drain, the charge transport through the
tetrahedral DNA device can be separated into three regimes, ranging from
disorder-induced linear decrement of charge transport to disorder-insensitive
charge transport, and to disorder-enhanced charge transport. Finally, we
predict that the DNA tetrahedron functions as a more efficient spin filter
compared to double-stranded DNA and opposite spin polarization could be
observed at different drains, which may be used to separate spin-unpolarized
electrons into spin-up ones and spin-down ones. These results could be readily
checked by electrochemical measurements and may help for designing novel DNA

unsupervised visual representation learning by maximizing the similarity
between two augmented views of the same image (positive pairs) and
simultaneously contrasting other different images (negative pairs). However,
this type of methods, such as SimCLR and MoCo, relies heavily on a large number
of negative pairs and thus requires either large batches or memory banks. In
contrast, some recent non-contrastive SSL methods, such as BYOL and SimSiam,
attempt to discard negative pairs by introducing asymmetry and show remarkable
performance. Unfortunately, to avoid collapsed solutions caused by not using
negative pairs, these methods require sophisticated asymmetry designs. In this
paper, we argue that negative pairs are still necessary but one is sufficient,
i.e., triplet is all you need. A simple triplet-based loss can achieve
surprisingly good performance without requiring large batches or asymmetry.
Moreover, we observe that unsupervised visual representation learning can gain
significantly from randomness. Based on this observation, we propose a simple
plug-in RandOm MApping (ROMA) strategy by randomly mapping samples into other
spaces and enforcing these randomly projected samples to satisfy the same
correlation requirement. The proposed ROMA strategy not only achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in conjunction with the triplet-based loss, but

ferromagnets in the field of spintronics as high-density devices with ultrafast
operation. To take full advantage of noncollinear antiferromagnets in
spintronics applications, it is important to achieve efficient manipulation of
noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin. Here, using the anomalous Hall effect as
an electrical signal of the triangular magnetic configuration, spin-orbit
torque switching with no external magnetic field is demonstrated in
noncollinear antiferromagnetic antiperovskite manganese nitride Mn$_3$GaN at
room temperature. The pulse-width dependence and subsequent relaxation of Hall
signal behavior indicate that the spin-orbit torque plays a more important role
than the thermal contribution due to pulse injection. In addition, multistate
memristive switching with respect to pulse current density was observed. The
findings advance the effective control of noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin,
facilitating the use of such materials in antiferromagnetic spintronics and
neuromorphic computing applications.

  https://github.com/Adaxry/conf_aware_ss4nmt",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Scheduled sampling is an effective method to alleviate the exposure bias
problem of neural machine translation. It simulates the inference scene by
randomly replacing ground-truth target input tokens with predicted ones during
training. Despite its success, its critical schedule strategies are merely
based on training steps, ignoring the real-time model competence, which limits
its potential performance and convergence speed. To address this issue, we
propose confidence-aware scheduled sampling. Specifically, we quantify
real-time model competence by the confidence of model predictions, based on
which we design fine-grained schedule strategies. In this way, the model is
exactly exposed to predicted tokens for high-confidence positions and still
ground-truth tokens for low-confidence positions. Moreover, we observe vanilla
scheduled sampling suffers from degenerating into the original teacher forcing
mode since most predicted tokens are the same as ground-truth tokens.
Therefore, under the above confidence-aware strategy, we further expose more
noisy tokens (e.g., wordy and incorrect word order) instead of predicted ones
for high-confidence token positions. We evaluate our approach on the
Transformer and conduct experiments on large-scale WMT 2014 English-German, WMT
2014 English-French, and WMT 2019 Chinese-English. Results show that our
approach significantly outperforms the Transformer and vanilla scheduled
sampling on both translation quality and convergence speed.

  Semi-supervised Method for Uncertainty Quantification",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The surrogate model-based uncertainty quantification method has drawn much
attention in many engineering fields. Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and deep
learning (DL) are powerful methods for building a surrogate model. However, PCE
needs to increase the expansion order to improve the accuracy of the surrogate
model, which causes more labeled data to solve the expansion coefficients, and
DL also requires a lot of labeled data to train the deep neural network (DNN).
First of all, this paper proposes the adaptive arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC)
and proves two properties about the adaptive expansion coefficients. Based on
the adaptive aPC, a semi-supervised deep adaptive arbitrary polynomial chaos
expansion (Deep aPCE) method is proposed to reduce the training data cost and
improve the surrogate model accuracy. For one hand, the Deep aPCE method uses
two properties of the adaptive aPC to assist in training the DNN based on only
a small amount of labeled data and many unlabeled data, significantly reducing
the training data cost. On the other hand, the Deep aPCE method adopts the DNN
to fine-tune the adaptive expansion coefficients dynamically, improving the
Deep aPCE model accuracy with lower expansion order. Besides, the Deep aPCE
method can directly construct accurate surrogate models of the high dimensional
stochastic systems without complex dimension-reduction and model decomposition
operations. Five numerical examples and an actual engineering problem are used
to verify the effectiveness of the Deep aPCE method.

different two-dimensional systems, including mono- and bilayer Td-WTe2,
angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 heterobilayers and Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene,
which all share a similar graphite-gated geometry. We find that the resistivity
of the 2D system generically shows quantum oscillations as a function of
magnetic field corresponding to a high-density Fermi surface when they are
tuned near an insulating state, in contravention of na\""ive band theory.
Simultaneous measurement of the resistivity of the graphite gates show that
these oscillations are precisely correlated with quantum oscillations in the
resistivity of the graphite gates themselves. Further supporting this
connection, the oscillations are quenched when the graphite gate is replaced by
TaSe2, a high-density metal that does not show quantum oscillations. The
observed phenomenon arises from the oscillatory behavior of graphite density of
states, which modulates the device capacitance and, as a consequence, the
carrier density in the sample layer even when a constant electrochemical
potential is maintained between the sample and the gate electrode. Oscillations
are most pronounced near insulating states where the resistivity is strongly
density dependent. Our study suggests a unified mechanism for quantum
oscillations in graphite-gated 2D insulators based on sample-gate coupling.

generate dynamic modality-aware filters with two independent networks. The
visible and thermal filters will be used to conduct a dynamic convolutional
operation on their corresponding input feature maps respectively. Inspired by
residual connection, both the generated visible and thermal feature maps will
be summarized with input feature maps. The augmented feature maps will be fed
into the RoI align module to generate instance-level features for subsequent
classification. To address issues caused by heavy occlusion, fast motion and

exploiting a new direction-aware target driven attention mechanism. The spatial

especially for newly published books. Hence, this paper measured book impact
based on an evaluation system constructed by integrating multiple evaluation
sources. Specifically, we conducted finer-grained mining on the multiple
evaluation sources, including books' internal evaluation resources and external
evaluation resources. Various technologies (e.g. topic extraction, sentiment
analysis, text classification) were used to extract corresponding evaluation
metrics from the internal and external evaluation resources. Then, Expert
evaluation combined with analytic hierarchy process was used to integrate the
evaluation metrics and construct a book impact evaluation system. Finally, the
reliability of the evaluation system was verified by comparing with the results
of expert evaluation, detailed and diversified evaluation results were then
obtained. The experimental results reveal that differential evaluation
resources can measure the books' impacts from different dimensions, and the

the disciplinary differences should be considered for assessing books' impacts.

(VOF) model based two-phase solver was developed with simplified Maxwell
equations implemented in the open-source platform OpenFOAM\textsuperscript. The
numerically obtained critical value for the linear stability matches well with
the theoretical values. To highlight the effect of the slip boundary at

with hysteresis loop linking the linear and finite amplitude criteria, which is
Uf = 0.059, was obtained in this situation. It is concluded that the lack of
viscous effect at interface leads to a significant increase in the flow
intensity, which is the reason for the smaller instability threshold in
two-phase system. The presence of interface also changes the flow structure and
makes the flow vortices shift closer to the interface.

waveguides in the strip-loaded, nanowire, and half-core geometries in the
wavelength range from $1480$ to $1560~\text{nm}$. The highest $\alpha_2$ values

Dirichlet wall. The model was formalized for a massless scalar field, and the
expectation value of the stress tensor has been expressed in terms of the
reduced Green function of the equation of motion. In the limit of interest,
$\alpha \gg 1$, which approximates a Dirichlet wall, a closed-form expression

  To demonstrate feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new backdooring
technique. It stacks the adversarial meta-task (e.g., sentiment analysis) onto
a seq2seq model, backpropagates the desired meta-task output (e.g., positive
sentiment) to points in the word-embedding space we call ""pseudo-words,"" and
uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output distribution of the seq2seq model.
Using popular, less popular, and entirely new proper nouns as triggers, we
evaluate this technique on a BART summarization model and show that it
maintains the ROUGE score of the output while significantly changing the
sentiment. We explain why model spinning can be a dangerous technique in
AI-powered disinformation and discuss how to mitigate these attacks.

high mutual information with the ground-truth labels, which is measured by an

thermal spectral component is also confirmed by the direct fit of the physical
models to the observed spectra. Interestingly, the physical photosphere model
also constrained a redshift of $z\sim$ 0.3 for this burst, which help us to
identify a host galaxy candidate at such a distance within the location error

Specifically, we investigate three cases of the joint device activity

activity distributions, and formulate the average, worst-case average, and
sample average throughput maximization problems, respectively. The problems in
the three cases are challenging nonconvex problems. In the case of perfect

give rise to large flow instability within RPT flow zones, where the vaneless
space (VS) between the runner and guide vanes is claimed to be the base. Recent
studies have pointed out the possibility of these instabilities stretching to
other flow zones causing more losses and subsequent machine operational
performance degradation. This study therefore intends to investigate the VS
flow instability, its propagation characteristics, and the effect of machine
influx and runner blade number on the same. CFD-backed simulations are
conducted on ten flow conditions spanning from turbine zone through runaway
vicinities to turbine brake (OC1 to OC15), using three runner models with
different blades (7BL, 8BL, and 9BL). While VS pressure pulsation amplitudes
increased with runner blades number decrease, the continuously decreasing flow
led to gradual VS pressure pulsation level drop within the Turbine zone before
increasing to Runaway and dropping back to deep turbine brake zone. The effect
of the same parameters on the transmission mode to VS upstream flow zones is
more remarkable than the downstream flow zones.

condensed matter physics, but also in data science. Here, we propose the use of
topological data analysis in unsupervised learning of the topological phase
diagrams. This is possible because the quantum distance can capture the shape
of the space formed by the Bloch wavefunctions as we sweep over the Brillouin
zone. Therefore, if we minimize the volume of the space formed by the
wavefunction through a continuous deformation, the wavefunctions will end up
forming distinct spaces which depend on the topology of the wavefunctions.
Combining this observation with the topological data analysis, which provides
tools such as the persistence diagram to capture the topology of the space
formed by the wavefunctions, we can cluster together Hamiltonians that give
rise to similar persistence diagrams after the deformation. By examining these
clusters as well as representative persistence diagrams in the clusters, we can
draw the phase diagram as well as distinguish between topologically trivial and
nontrivial phases. Our proposal to minimize the volume can be interpreted as
finding geodesics in 1D Brillouin zone, and minimal surfaces in 2D and
higher-dimensional Brillouin zones. Using this interpretation, we can guarantee
the convergence of the minimization under certain conditions, which is an
outstanding feature of our algorithm. We demonstrate the working principles of
our machine learning algorithm using various models.

thermal conductivity by bonding. In this work, two GaN-diamond bonded
composites are prepared via modified surface activated bonding (SAB) at room
temperature with silicon interlayers of different thicknesses (15 nm and 22
nm). Before and after post-annealing process at 800 oC, thermal boundary
conductance (TBC) across the bonded interface including the interlayer and the
stress of GaN layer are investigated by time-domain thermoreflectance and Raman
spectroscopy, respectively. After bonding, the 15 nm Si interlayer achieved a
higher TBC. The post-annealing significantly increased the TBC of both
interfaces, while the TBC of 22 nm silicon interlayer increased greater and
became higher than that of 15 nm. Detailed investigation of the microstructure
and composition of the interfaces were carried out to understand the difference
in interfacial thermal conduction. The obtained stress was no more than 230 MPa
for both before and after the annealing, and this high thermal stability of the
bonded composites indicates that the room temperature bonding can realize a
GaN-on-diamond template suitable for further epitaxial growth or device
process. This work brings a novel strategy of SAB followed by high-temperature
annealing to fabricate a GaN-on-diamond device with a high TBC.

for identifying artefacts such as motion and off-centration, which rely
specialized knowledge and need tedious and time-consuming manual

with any visual acuity disease. However, the variations in OCTA visual quality
affect the performance of deep learning in any downstream marginally. Moreover,
filtering the low-quality OCTA images out is both labor-intensive and
time-consuming. To address these issues, we develop an automated computer-aided
OCTA image processing system using deep neural networks as the classifier and

present a comprehensive study on the evolution of the superconductivity and
nematicity in FeSe with thickness from bulk single crystal down to bilayer
($\sim$ 1.1 nm) through exfoliation. With decreasing flake thickness, both the
structural transition temperature $T_{\rm s}$ and the superconducting
transition temperature $T_{\rm c}^{\rm zero}$ are greatly suppressed. The
magnetic field ($B$) dependence of Hall resistance $R_{xy}$ at 15 K changes
from $B$-nonlinear to $B$-linear behavior up to 9 T, as the thickness ($d$) is
reduced to 13 nm. $T_{\rm c}$ is linearly dependent on the inverse of flake
thickness (1/$d$) when $d\le$ 13 nm, and a clear drop of $T_{\rm c}$ appears
with thickness smaller than 27 nm. The $I$-$V$ characteristic curves in
ultrathin flakes reveal the signature of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
transition, indicating the presence of two-dimensional superconductivity.
Anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements further support 2D superconductivity
in few-layer FeSe. Increase of disorder scattering, anisotropic strains and
dimensionality effect with reducing the thickness of FeSe flakes, might be
taken into account for understanding these behaviors. Our study provides
systematic insights into the evolution of the superconducting properties,
structural transition and Hall resistance of a superconductor FeSe with flakes
thickness and provides an effective way to find two-dimensional
superconductivity as well as other 2D novel phenomena.

increasing attention in time series analysis for its capability to process

evolutionary subspace clustering, aiming at clustering temporal data according

this limitation and a new objective function with subspace self-expressiveness
constraint is introduced. We demonstrate that this method can not only
interpolate data at any time step for the evolutionary subspace clustering
task, but also achieve higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art evolutionary
subspace clustering methods. Both synthetic and real-world data are used to
illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method.

dynamically stable at pressure as low as 50 GPa, and Cmc21 has high Tc of 155 K

molecules are inserted into Im-3m-H3S and R3m-H3S sublattices, respectively.
Their Tc is dominated by the H3S lattice inside. The insertion of CH4 greatly
reduces the pressure required for the stability of the original H3S lattice,
but it has a negative impact on superconductivity that cannot be ignored. By
studying the effect of CH4 insertion in the H3S lattice, we can design hydrides
with Tc close to that of H3S and a greatly reduced pressure required for
stability.

the Earths magnetosphere. The reports were sporadic and the theoretical
interpretations were mainly event based which differ for slow or fast moving

an ideal, mathematically defined nonlinear coherent structure called a flat top

plasma model, it was shown that a slow moving offset bipolar pulse in the
auroral region can be interpreted as an ion acoustic flat top solitary wave.
The proposed theory is a generic one and can easily be extended to a fast
moving one under an appropriate plasma model. One important characteristic of
such structures is that they generally occur at the boundary of two different

code. Specifically, we define a notion that we call
high-dimensional-expanding-system (HDE-system). This is a set system defined by
incidence relations with certain high dimensional expansion relations between
its sets. We say that a linear code is modelled over HDE-system, if the
collection of linear constraints that the code satisfies could by described via
the HDE-system. We show that a code that can be modelled over HDE-system is
locally testable.
  This implies that high dimensional expansion phenomenon solely implies local
testability of codes. Prior work had to rely to local notions of local
testability to get some global forms of testability (e.g. co-systolic expansion
from local one, global agreement from local one), while our work infers global
testability directly from high dimensional expansion without relying on some
local form of testability.
  The local testability result that we obtain from HDE-systems is, in fact,
stronger than standard one, and we term it amplified local testability.
  We further show that most of the well studied locally testable codes as
Reed-Muller codes and more generally affine invariant codes with single-orbit
property fall into our framework. Namely, it is possible to show that they are
modelled over an HDE-system, and hence the family of all p-ary affine invariant
codes is amplified locally testable. This yields the strongest known testing
results for affine invariant codes with single orbit, strengthening the work of
Kaufman and Sudan.

analysis in forward-looking-sonar (FLS) imagery. Our framework relies on first
removing non-discriminative details from the imagery using a small-scale
DenseNet-inspired network. Doing so simplifies ensuing analyses and permits
generalizing from few labeled examples. We then cascade the filtered imagery
into a novel NeuralRAM-based convolutional matching network, NRMN, for low-shot
target recognition. We employ a small-scale FlowNet, LFN to align and register
FLS imagery across local temporal scales. LFN enables target label consensus
voting across images and generally improves target detection and recognition
rates.
  We evaluate our framework using real-world FLS imagery with multiple broad
target classes that have high intra-class variability and rich sub-class
structure. We show that few-shot learning, with anywhere from ten to thirty
class-specific exemplars, performs similarly to supervised deep networks
trained on hundreds of samples per class. Effective zero-shot learning is also
possible. High performance is realized from the inductive-transfer properties
of NRMNs when distractor elements are removed.

discovered at so called exceptional points (EPs). This is done by using
parity-time (PT) -symmetric non-Hermitian systems and balancing gains and
losses. When combined with EP-physics, recently, metasurfaces have shown
greater abilities for wave manipulation than conventional metasurface systems.
However, the solving process for EPs usually requires the transfer matrix
method (TMM) or a parametric sweep, which are both complex and time-consuming.
In this Letter, we develop a simple theoretical model, which is based on
acoustic equivalent-circuit theory and can find the analytic solutions for EPs
directly. As a proof of concept, PT-symmetric acoustic metasurfaces are studied
to test the theoretical model, which enables unidirectional antireflection
effects at EPs. In addition, finite element method (FEM) simulations are
performed to study these EP solutions using the theoretical model for different
mediums, wavelengths, angles of incidence, and gain-loss ratios. Our work
offers a simple and powerful theoretical tool for designing PT-symmetric
metasurfaces at EPs and may also be used for other classical wave systems.

overcome errors introduced by today's quantum computers, hybrid algorithms
combining classical and quantum computers are used. In this paper we tackle the

classical-quantum algorithm to solve the MQO on a gate-based quantum computer.
We perform a detailed experimental evaluation of our algorithm and compare its
performance against a competing approach that employs a quantum annealer --
another type of quantum computer. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm currently can only handle small problem sizes due to the limited
number of qubits available on a gate-based quantum computer compared to a
quantum computer based on quantum annealing. However, our algorithm shows a
qubit efficiency of close to 99% which is almost a factor of 2 higher compared
to the state of the art implementation. Finally, we analyze how our algorithm
scales with larger problem sizes and conclude that our approach shows promising
results for near-term quantum computers.

  More precisely, we begin by defining cooperative games on general graphs and
generalize Shapley's value allocation formula for those games in terms of
stochastic path integral driven by the associated canonical Markov chain. We
then show the value allocation operator, one for each player defined by the
path integral, turns out to be the solution to the Poisson's equation defined
via the combinatorial Hodge decomposition on general weighted graphs.
  Several motivational examples and applications are presented, in particular,
a section is devoted to reinterpret and extend Nash's and Kohlberg and Neyman's

revenue management, suggest that our general framework does not have to be

thus, conducting research on Korean cabbage harvesters is of immense
importance. Although these harvesters have been developed in various forms,
they have not yet attained commercialization. Most Korean cabbage fields have
slopes; thus there are several challenges, that can prevent accurate
harvesting. Therefore, to address these challenges at the site, we adopt two
cylinders in this study, develop a mechanism that enables attitude control of
the cutting device, not driving platform body, to cope with slopes. By
maintaining the level, angle, height of cutting, we can reduce loss and improve
harvest performance. It is difficult to find examples where these mechanisms
have been applied. For basic research, sensor fusion has been carried out based
on the Kalman filter, which is commonly utilized for attitude control. The
hydraulic cylinder was controlled using the data obtained for maintaining the
attitude. Furthermore, field tests were conducted to validate this system, and
the root mean square error (RMSE) was obtained and verified to quantitatively
assess the presence or absence of attitude control. Therefore, the purpose of
this study is to suggest a development direction for Korean cabbage harvesters
via the proposed attitude control system.

variations on a timescale of 10 to 15 days, which may be the signature of a
coupling between oscillations and thermal convection in the layer where the
kappa-mechanism is operating.The Altair oscillation spectrum does not contain a

effect of the surrounding viscous gas on the solid particles is accounted for
by means of a deterministic viscous drag force plus a stochastic Langevin-like
term defined in terms of the environmental temperature $T_\text{env}$. Grad's
moment method is employed to determine the temperature ratio and the pressure
tensor in terms of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, the masses
and diameters of the components of the mixture, and the environmental
temperature. Analytical results are compared against event-driven Langevin
simulations for mixtures of hard spheres with the same mass density
$m_1/m_2=(\sigma_1/\sigma_2)^3$, $m_i$ and $\sigma_i$ being the mass and
diameter, respectively, of the species $i$. It is confirmed that the
theoretical predictions agree with simulations of various size ratios
$\sigma_1/\sigma_2$ and for elastic and inelastic collisions in the wide range
of parameters' space. It is remarkable that the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$ and
the viscosity ratio $\eta_1/\eta_2$ ($\eta_i$ being the partial contribution of
the species $i$ to the total shear viscosity $\eta=\eta_1+\eta_2$)
discontinuously change at a certain shear rate as the size ratio increases;
this feature (which is expected to occur in the thermodynamic limit) cannot be
captured by simulations due to small system size. In addition, a
Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook (BGK)-type kinetic model adapted to mixtures of
inelastic hard spheres is exactly solved when $T_\text{env}$ is much smaller
than the kinetic temperature $T$. A comparison between the velocity
distribution functions obtained from Grad's method, BGK model, and simulations
is carried out.

radial drift of dust particles. We refer to this instability as ``coagulation
instability"" and regard it as a promising mechanism to concentrate dust
particles and assist planetesimal formation in the very early stages of disk
evolution. Because of dust-density dependence of collisional coagulation
efficiency, dust particles efficiently (inefficiently) grow in a region of
positive (negative) dust density perturbations, which lead to a small radial
variation of dust sizes and as a result radial velocity perturbations. The
resultant velocity perturbations lead to dust concentration and amplify dust
density perturbations. This positive feedback makes a disk unstable. The growth
timescale of coagulation instability is a few tens of orbital periods even when
dust-to-gas mass ratio is of the order of $10^{-3}$. In a protoplanetary disk,
radial drift and coagulation of dust particles tend to result in dust
depletion. The present instability locally concentrates dust particles even in
such a dust-depleted region. The resulting concentration provides preferable
sites for dust-gas instabilities to develop, which leads to further
concentration. Dust diffusion and aerodynamical feedback tend to stabilize
short-wavelength modes, but do not completely suppress the growth of
coagulation instability. Therefore, coagulation instability is expected to play
an important role in setting up the next stage for other instabilities to
further develop toward planetesimal formation, such as streaming instability or
secular gravitational instability.

unexpected behavior of applications. Existing techniques to enforce spatial
safety work broadly at either object or pointer granularity. Object-based
approaches tend to incur high CPU overheads, whereas pointer-based approaches
incur both high CPU and memory overheads. SGXBounds, an object-based approach,
is so far the most efficient technique that provides complete out-of-bounds
protection for objects. However, a major drawback of this approach is that it
can't support address space larger than 32-bit.
  In this paper, we present CGuard, a tool that provides object-bounds
protection for C applications with comparable overheads to SGXBounds without
restricting the application address space. CGuard stores the bounds information
just before the base address of an object and encodes the relative offset of
the base address in the spare bits of the virtual address available in x86_64
architecture. For an object that can't fit in the spare bits, CGuard uses a
custom memory layout that enables it to find the base address of the object in
just one memory access. Our study revealed spatial safety violations in the gcc
and x264 benchmarks from the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite and the string_match
benchmark from the Phoenix benchmark suite. The execution time overheads for
the SPEC CPU2017 and Phoenix benchmark suites were 42% and 26% respectively,

photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) of the camera sensor, while also
considering QR-code-based meta-information. During authentication, the user is
required to take two photos that contain two QR codes presented on a screen.
The presented QR code images also contain a unique probe signal, similar to a
camera fingerprint, generated by the protocol. During verification, the server
computes the fingerprint of the received photos and authenticates the user if
(i) the probe signal is present, (ii) the metadata embedded in the QR codes is
correct and (iii) the camera fingerprint is identified correctly. However, the
protocol is vulnerable to forgery attacks when the attacker can compute the
camera fingerprint from external photos, as shown in our preliminary work. In
this context, we propose an enhancement for the ABC protocol based on motion
sensor data, as an additional and passive authentication layer. Smartphones can
be identified through their motion sensor data, which, unlike photos, is never
posted by users on social media platforms, thus being more secure than using
photographs alone. To this end, we transform motion signals into embedding
vectors produced by deep neural networks, applying Support Vector Machines for
the smartphone identification task. Our change to the ABC protocol results in a
multi-modal protocol that lowers the false acceptance rate for the attack

states may be driven by an oscillating low-frequency magnetic field, in the
presence of couplings to a third nuclear spin, and a weak bias magnetic
field.This phenomenon allows the generation of strong nuclear hyperpolarization
of ${}^{13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclei, starting from the nuclear singlet polarization
of a ${}^{1}\mathrm{H}$ spin pair, associated with the enriched para spin
isomer of hydrogen gas. Hyperpolarization is demonstrated for two molecular

reliably transfer affect models that are built in the laboratory to real world
settings, namely in the wild. The existing gap between in vitro and in vivo
affect applications is mainly caused by limitations related to affect sensing
including intrusiveness, hardware malfunctions, availability of sensors, but
also privacy and security. As a response to these limitations in this paper we
are inspired by recent advances in machine learning and introduce the concept
of privileged information for operating affect models in the wild. The presence
of privileged information enables affect models to be trained across multiple
modalities available in a lab setting and ignore modalities that are not
available in the wild with no significant drop in their modeling performance.
The proposed privileged information framework is tested in a game arousal
corpus that contains physiological signals in the form of heart rate and
electrodermal activity, game telemetry, and pixels of footage from two
dissimilar games that are annotated with arousal traces. By training our
arousal models using all modalities (in vitro) and using solely pixels for
testing the models (in vivo), we reach levels of accuracy obtained from models
that fuse all modalities both for training and testing. The findings of this
paper make a decisive step towards realizing affect interaction in the wild.

(froxels), by using depth and capturing-setup dependent discretization of the
view frustum. Based on such discretization, we count the number of rays mapping
to the same pixel on the capturing device(s). By means of this count, we
propose histograms of ray-counts over the froxels (fristograms). Fristograms
can be used as a tool to analyze and reveal interesting aspects of the
underlying LF, like the number of rays originating from a scene point and the
color distribution of these rays. As an example, we show its ability by
significantly reducing the number of rays which enables noise reduction while
maintaining the realistic rendering of non-Lambertian or partially occluded
regions.

C++ is clearly how C++ is being used nowadays. But, MPIs syntax and semantics
defined and extended with C and Fortran interfaces that align with the
capabilities and limitations of C89 and Fortran-77.Unfortunately, the
language-independent specification also clearly reflects the intersection of
what these languages could syntactically and semantically manage at the outset
in 1993, rather than being truly language neutral.In this paper, we propose a
modern C++ language interface to replace the C language binding for C++
programmers with an upward-compatible architecture that leverages all the
benefits of C++11-20 for performance, productivity, and interoperability with
other popular C++ libraries and interfaces for HPC. Demand is demonstrably
strong for this second attempt at language support for C++ in MPI after the
original interface, which was added in MPI-2, then was found to lack specific
benefits over theC binding, and so was subsequently removed in MPI-3. Since C++
and its idiomatic usage have evolved since the original C++ language binding
was removed from the standard, this new effort is both timely and important for
MPI applications. Also, many C++ application programmers create their own, ad
hoc shim libraries over MPI to provide some degree of abstraction unique to
their particular project, which means many such abstraction libraries are being
devised without any specific commonality other than the demand for such.

is found to have a partial quasiconvexity that leads to the development of an

a recently improved analysis of SoHO/MDI heliseismic data for solar cycle 23.
In agreement with earlier findings, the results confirmed the sensitivity of
high order moments ($n>1$) to the radial and latitudinal distribution of
rotation in the convective zone. The computed value of the quadrupole moment

peculiar topologically protected interface or edge states. Their operating
frequency, however, is generally fixed once designed and fabricated. Here, we
propose to overcome this limitation by utilizing soft topological phononic
crystals. In particular, we design a simple one-dimensional periodic system of
soft cylindrical waveguides to realize mechanically tunable topological
interface states for longitudinal waves. To this end, we employ the nonlinear
elasticity theory and its linearized incremental version to fully account for
both geometric and material nonlinearities of the system. We derive the
dispersion relation for small-amplitude longitudinal motions superimposed on
the finitely deformed state. In addition, our analytical results provide
information about the corresponding Bloch wave modes, displacement field
distributions, and signal transmission coefficients for finite cylindrical
waveguides with identical or various unit-cell topologies. Our numerical
results illustrate the low-frequency topological interface state occurring at
the interface between two topologically distinct soft phononic cylinders.
Moreover, we show that the corresponding frequency in the overlapped band gap
can be continuously adjusted by an external force. This analytical result is
also validated by the finite element simulations. Finally, we provide the
topological phase diagrams to demonstrate the tunable position and existence
condition of the topological interface states when tuning the external loading.
The low-frequency tunable topological interface states with remarkable field
enhancement may find a wide range of potential applications such as tunable
energy harvesters, low-pass filters and high-sensitivity detectors for

temperature, these crystals can exhibit isotropic, nematic and chiral nematic
phases. The question is addressed of how the phase of a crystal and the state
of incident light can affect the quasi-elastic energy spectra of the scattered
radiation, whose shape is usually described by the combination of Lorentzian
and Gaussian components. Special attention is paid to the \textit{chiral
phase}, for which the Raman QES spectrum is dominated by a Lorentzian with
reduced linewidth, pointing to diminished disorder and configurational entropy.
Moreover, this phase is also known for a regime of iridescence (selective
backscattering) which arises when the wavelength of incident light becomes
comparable with the chiral pitch length. Detailed measurements, performed in
this \textit{resonant} regime and by employing twisted light, carrying various
projections of the orbital angular momentum (OAM), have indicated a low-energy
scattering surplus depending on OAM. We argue that this observation might
indicate a transfer of angular momentum between light and the liquid crystal.

isotopologues H$^{12}$CN, HN$^{12}$C, H$^{13}$CN, HN$^{13}$C, HC$^{15}$N,
H$^{15}$NC, DCN and DNC were all detected towards both regions. Abundances and
excitation conditions were obtained from radiative transfer analysis of
molecular line emission under the assumption of Local Thermodynamical
Equilibrium. In the pre-shock gas, the abundances of the HCN and HNC
isotopologues are similar to those encountered in dark clouds, with a HCN/HNC
abundance ratio $\approx 1$ for all isotopologues. A strong D-enrichment
(D/H$\approx 0.06$) is measured in the pre-shock gas. There is no evidence of
$^{15}$N fractionation neither in the quiescent nor in the shocked gas. At the
passage of the shock, the HCN and HNC abundances increase in the gas phase in
different manners so that the HCN/HNC relative abundance ratio increases by a
factor 20. The gas-grain chemical and shock model UCLCHEM allows us to
reproduce the observed trends for a C-type shock with pre-shock density $n$(H)=
$10^5$cm$^{-3}$ and shock velocity $V_s= 40$km/s. We conclude that the HCN/HNC
variations across the shock are mainly caused by the sputtering of the grain

storage and on the time scale of its retrieval for a generic quantum field

bounded from above by the surface area of the object measured in units of a
Goldstone decay constant. The Goldstone bosons are universally present due to
the spontaneous breaking of Poincare and internal symmetries by the
information-storing object. Applied to a black hole, the bound reproduces the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. However, the relation goes beyond gravity. The
minimal time-scale required for retrieving the quantum information from a

For a black hole this reproduces the Page time as well as the quantum
break-time. The same expression for the information retrieval time is shared by
non-gravitational saturated states in gauge theories, including QCD. The
saturated objects exhibit some universal signatures such as the emission of
ultra-soft radiation. Similar bounds apply to non-relativistic many-body

practical applications, such as in the enhanced oil recovery process or in the
groundwater remediation. Once the flow rate exceeds a critical value in such
flows, an elastic instability with fluctuating flow field is observed, which
ultimately transits to a more chaotic and turbulence-like flow structure as the
flow rate further increases. In a recent study, it has been experimentally
shown that this chaotic flow behaviour of viscoelastic fluids can be suppressed
by increasing the geometric disorder in a model porous media consisting of a
microchannel with several micropillars placed in it. However, the present
numerical study demonstrates that this is not always true. We show that it
depends on the initial arrangement of the micropillars for mimicking the porous
media. In particular, we find that for an initial ordered and aligned
configuration of the micropillars, the introduction of geometric order actually
increases the chaotic flow dynamics as opposed to that seen for an initial
ordered and staggered configuration of the micropillars. We suggest that this
chaotic flow behaviour actually depends on the number of the stagnation points
revealed to the flow field where maximum stretching of the viscoelastic
microstructure happens. Our findings and explanation are perfectly in line with
that observed and provided in a more recent experimental study.

Contemporary flux-conservative GRMHD codes numerically evolve a set of
conservative equations based on `conserved' variables which then need to be
converted back into the fundamental (`primitive') variables. The corresponding
conservative-to-primitive variable recovery procedure, based on root-finding
algorithms, constitutes one of the core elements of such GRMHD codes. Recently,
a new robust, accurate and efficient recovery scheme called RePrimAnd was
introduced, which has demonstrated the ability to always converge to a unique

WSe$_{2}$ layer thickness, down to the monolayer limit. We observe a large
out-of-plane field-like torque with spin-torque conductivities up to
$1\times10^4 ({\hbar}/2e) ({\Omega}m)^{-1}$. For some devices, we also observe
a smaller in-plane antidamping-like torque, with spin-torque conductivities up
to $4\times10^{3} ({\hbar}/2e) ({\Omega}m)^{-1}$, comparable to other TMD-based
systems. Both torques show no clear dependence on the WSe$_{2}$ thickness, as
expected for a Rashba system. Unexpectedly, we observe a strong in-plane
magnetic anisotropy - up to about $6.6\times10^{4} erg/cm^{3}$ - induced in
permalloy by the underlying hexagonal WSe$_{2}$ crystal. Using scanning
transmission electron microscopy, we confirm that the easy axis of the magnetic
anisotropy is aligned to the armchair direction of the WSe$_{2}$. Our results
indicate a strong interplay between the ferromagnet and TMD, and unveil the
nature of the spin-orbit torques in TMD-based devices. These findings open new
avenues for possible methods for optimizing the torques and the interaction
with interfaced magnets, important for future non-volatile magnetic devices for

cases for sterile mass matrices are studied in both normal and inverted
hierarchy mass ordering. Chapter three is an extension of the previous chapter.
The neutrino mass generation and baryogenesis {\it via} thermal leptogenesis
are studied in the fermionic sector. On the other hand, an extended multi Higgs
doublet model is studied in the scalar sector. Among the three Higgs doublet,
one of them does not acquire any vacuum expectation value (VEV); hence, it
behaves as an inert Higgs. The lightest component of this behaves as a viable
dark matter candidate. Within MES, sterile mass can be stressed up to the $keV$
scale. In the fourth chapter, we studied various phenomenologies considering
sterile neutrino mass in the $keV$ range. This $keV$ scaled sterile neutrino
also plays the role of dark matter candidate in our study. The fifth chapter is
dedicated to the texture-zero neutrino dark matter model. We study
active-sterile mixing, baryogenesis $via$ resonant leptogenesis and
$0\nu\beta\beta$ in the fermion sector. While, in the scalar sector, the
complex scalar flavon that gives rise to sterile mass takes part in dark matter
study. The imaginary component of that scalar flavon is behaving as a viable

disturbances in their training process: 1) Complete facial structure in a

prone to stick on memorization of the entire training dataset and show
sensitivity to nonhomologous domain distribution. In this paper, we propose
Structure Destruction Module and Content Combination Module to address these
two imitations separately. The former mechanism destroys images into patches to
construct a non-structural input, while the latter mechanism recombines patches
from different subdomains or classes into a mixup construct. Based on this
splitting-and-splicing operation, Local Relation Modeling Module is further
proposed to model the second-order relationship between patches. We evaluate
our method on extensive public datasets and promising experimental results to
demonstrate the reliability of our method against state-of-the-art competitors.

concerning the emission from M87* and, more recently, its polarization
properties, require an increasingly accurate modeling of the plasma flows
around the accreting black hole. Radiatively inefficient sources such as M87*
and Sgr A* are typically modeled with the SANE (standard and normal evolution)
paradigm, if the accretion dynamics is smooth, or with the MAD (magnetically
arrested disk) paradigm, if the black hole's magnetosphere reacts by halting
the accretion sporadically, resulting in a highly dynamical process. While the
recent polarization studies seem to favor MAD models, this may not be true for
all sources, and SANE accretion surely still deserves attention. In this work,
we investigate the possibility of reaching the typical degree of magnetization
and other accretion properties expected for SANE disks by resorting to the
mean-field dynamo process in axisymmetric GRMHD simulations, which are supposed
to mimic the amplifying action of an unresolved magnetorotational
instability-driven turbulence. We show that it is possible to reproduce the
main diagnostics present in the literature by starting from very unfavorable
initial configurations, such as a purely toroidal magnetic field with
negligible magnetization.

protection needs are high, i.e., in banking and insurance, regulatory solvency
requirements are an instrument to prevent that creditors incur losses on their
claims. The current regulatory requirements based on Value at Risk and Average
Value at Risk limit the probability of default of financial institutions, but
they fail to control the size of recovery on creditors' claims in the case of
default. We resolve this failure by developing a novel risk measure, Recovery
Value at Risk. Our conceptual approach can flexibly be extended and allows the
construction of general recovery risk measures for various risk management
purposes. By design, these risk measures control recovery on creditors' claims
and integrate the protection needs of creditors into the incentive structure of
the management. We provide detailed case studies and applications: We analyze
how recovery risk measures react to the joint distributions of assets and
liabilities on firms' balance sheets and compare the corresponding capital
requirements with the current regulatory benchmarks based on Value at Risk and
Average Value at Risk. We discuss how to calibrate recovery risk measures to
historic regulatory standards. Finally, we show that recovery risk measures can
be applied to performance-based management of business divisions of firms and
that they allow for a tractable characterization of optimal tradeoffs between

solar wind acceleration by carrying energy into interplanetary space in the

velocity distribution functions (VDFs) shaped by expansion, Coulomb collisions,

deficit in the anti-strahl direction, which was recently discovered in the
near-Sun solar wind, drives a kinetic instability and creates whistler waves
with wave vectors that are quasi-parallel to the direction of the background
magnetic field. We combine high-cadence measurements of electron pitch-angle
distribution functions and electromagnetic waves provided by Solar Orbiter
during its first orbit. Our case study is based on a burst-mode data interval

(0.52 au) from the Sun, during which several whistler wave packets were
detected by Solar Orbiter's Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW) instrument. The
sunward deficit creates kinetic conditions under which the quasi-parallel
whistler wave is driven unstable. We directly test our predictions for the
existence of these waves through solar wind observations. We find whistler
waves that are quasi-parallel and almost circularly polarised, propagating away
from the Sun, coinciding with a pronounced sunward deficit in the electron VDF.
The cyclotron-resonance condition is fulfilled for electrons moving in the
direction opposite to the direction of wave propagation, with energies
corresponding to those associated with the sunward deficit.

observations trace magnetic fields on the 1000-au scale, the directions of
which are neither parallel nor perpendicular to the outflow direction. Applying
the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method to the SMA polarization angle dispersion,
we estimate a field strength in the TMC-1A envelope of 1-5 mG. It is consistent
with the field strength needed to reduce the radial infall velocity to the
observed value, which is substantially less than the local} free-fall velocity.
The ALMA polarization observations consist of two distinct components -- a
central component and a north/south component. The central component shows
polarization directions in the disk minor axis to be azimuthal, suggesting dust
self-scattering in the TMC-1A disk. The north/south component is located along
the outflow axis and the polarization directions are aligned with the outflow
direction. We discuss possible origins of this polarization structure,
including grain alignment by a toroidal magnetic field and mechanical alignment
by the gaseous outflow. In addition, we discover a spiral-like residual in the
total intensity (Stokes I) for the first time. The C18O emission suggests that
material in the spiral-like structure is infalling at a speed that is 20% of
the local Keplerian speed.

tools from randomized numerical linear algebra called ridge leverage scores to
accelerate the core tensor update step in the widely-used alternating least
squares (ALS) algorithm. Updating the core tensor, a severe bottleneck in ALS,
is a highly-structured ridge regression problem where the design matrix is a
Kronecker product of the factor matrices. We show how to use approximate ridge
leverage scores to construct a sketched instance for any ridge regression
problem such that the solution vector for the sketched problem is a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the original instance. Moreover, we show
that classical leverage scores suffice as an approximation, which then allows
us to exploit the Kronecker structure and update the core tensor in time that
depends predominantly on the rank and the sketching parameters (i.e., sublinear
in the size of the input tensor). We also give upper bounds for ridge leverage

to integrate radar and communication into one platform for spectrum sharing.
Various signalling strategies have been proposed to embed communication
information into the radar transmitted waveforms. Among these, complex
beampattern modulation (CBM) embeds communication information into the complex
transmit beampattens via changing the amplitude and phase of the beampatterns
towards the communication receiver. The embedding of random communication
information causes the clutter modulation and high range-Doppler sidelobe.
What's more, transmitting different waveforms on a pulse to pulse basis
degrades the radar target detection capacity when traditional sequential pulse
compression (SPC) and moving-target detection (MTD) is utilized. In this paper,
a minimum mean square error (MMSE) based filter, denoted as joint range and
Doppler adaptive processing (JRDAP) is proposed. The proposed method estimates
the targets' impulse response coefficients at each range-Doppler cell
adaptively to suppress high range-Doppler sidelobe and clutter modulation. The
performance of proposed method is very close to the full-dimension adaptive
multiple pulses compression (AMPC) while reducing computational complexity
greatly.

the so-called circular family of periodic orbits is the path that can drive the
passage between neighbouring resonances under dissipative effects. We
illustrate that the circular family can bridge first and higher order
resonances while its gaps at first-order MMRs can serve as boundaries that stop
transitions between resonances. In particular, for the Sun-asteroid-Jupiter
problem, we show that, during the migration of Jupiter in the protoplanetary
disc, a system initially evolving below the apocentric branch of a first-order
MMR follows the circular family and can either be captured into the pericentric
branch of an adjacent first-order MMR if the orbital migration is rapid or in a
higher order MMR in case of slow migration. Radial transport via the circular
family can be extended to many small body and planetary system configurations
undergoing dissipative effects (e.g., tidal dissipation, solar mass-loss and

longitudinal polarization fraction for $B^0\to \rho(770)^0 K^*(892)^0$ decay

is shown that the direct $CP$ asymmetries are large due to the sizable

the tree-dominant or penguin-dominant processes. The PQCD predictions for the

  In this paper, we formally introduce the task of Sign Language Video
Anonymisation (SLVA) as an automatic method to anonymise the visual appearance
of a sign language video whilst retaining the meaning of the original sign
language sequence. To tackle SLVA, we propose AnonySign, a novel automatic
approach for visual anonymisation of sign language data. We first extract pose
information from the source video to remove the original signer appearance. We
next generate a photo-realistic sign language video of a novel appearance from
the pose sequence, using image-to-image translation methods in a conditional
variational autoencoder framework. An approximate posterior style distribution
is learnt, which can be sampled from to synthesise novel human appearances. In
addition, we propose a novel \textit{style loss} that ensures style consistency
in the anonymised sign language videos.
  We evaluate AnonySign for the SLVA task with extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments highlighting both realism and anonymity of our novel
human appearance synthesis. In addition, we formalise an anonymity perceptual
study as an evaluation criteria for the SLVA task and showcase that video
anonymisation using AnonySign retains the original sign language content.

of clustering high-dimensional data. DNNs can extract useful features, and so
produce a lower dimensional representation, which is more amenable to
clustering techniques. As clustering is typically performed in a purely
unsupervised setting, where no training labels are available, the question then
arises as to how the DNN feature extractor can be trained. The most accurate
existing approaches combine the training of the DNN with the clustering
objective, so that information from the clustering process can be used to
update the DNN to produce better features for clustering. One problem with this
approach is that these ``pseudo-labels'' produced by the clustering algorithm
are noisy, and any errors that they contain will hurt the training of the DNN.
In this paper, we propose selective pseudo-label clustering, which uses only
the most confident pseudo-labels for training the~DNN. We formally prove the
performance gains under certain conditions. Applied to the task of image
clustering, the new approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance on three

Planck allows a detailed study of reionization beyond the average optical
depth. The lower value of the optical depth disfavours an early onset and an
early completion of reionization in favour of a redsfhit range where different
astrophysical probes provide sensible information on the sources of
reionization and the status of the intergalactic medium. In this work we extend
our previous study in which we constrained reionization by combining three
different probes - CMB, UV luminosity density and neutral hydrogen fraction
data - in both treatment and data: we first allow variation in the UV source
term varying the product of the efficiency of conversion of UV luminosity into
ionizing photons and the escape fraction together with the reionization and
cosmological parameters, and then we investigate the impact of a less
conservative cut for the UV luminosity function. We find that the estimate for
the efficiency is consistent within 95% C.L. with the fixed value we considered
in our previous results and is mostly constrained by the QHII data. We find
that allowing the efficiency to vary does not affect significantly our results
for the average optical depth for monotonic reionization histories, recovering
$\tau=0.0519_{-0.0008}^{+0.0010}$ at 68% CL , consistent with our previous
studies. Using a less conservative cut for the UV luminosity function, we find
$\tau=0.0541_{-0.0016}^{+0.0013}$ at 68% CL, due to the faint end of the
luminosity function in the data we use, that also prefers a larger contribution

geomaterials under different loading conditions. A micromechanics-based model
is proposed in which the field variables are linked to physical mechanisms at
the microcrack level: damage is related to the growth of microcracks, while
plasticity is related to the frictional sliding of closed microcracks.
Consequently, the hardening/softening functions and parameters entering the
free energy follow from the definition of a single degradation function and the
elastic material properties. The evolution of opening microcracks in tension
leads to brittle behavior and mode I fracture, while the evolution of closed
microcracks under frictional sliding in compression/shear leads to ductile
behavior and mode II fracture. Frictional sliding is endowed with a
non-associative law, a crucial aspect of the model that considers the effect of
dilation and allows for realistic material responses with non-vanishing
frictional energy dissipation. Despite the non-associative law, a variationally
consistent formulation is presented using notions of energy balance and
stability, following the energetic formulation for rate-independent systems.
The material response of the model is first described, followed by the
numerical implementation procedure and several benchmark finite element
simulations. The results highlight the ability of the model to describe
tensile, shear, and mixed-mode fracture, as well as responses with
brittle-to-ductile transition. A key result is that, by virtue of the
micromechanical arguments, realistic failure modes can be captured, without
resorting to the usual heuristic modifications considered in the phase-field
literature. The numerical results are thoroughly discussed with reference to
previous numerical studies, experimental evidence, and analytical fracture
criteria.

electrodynamics, here, we develop an analytic model that captures the physics

model, we identify two important opportunities of TPV systems operating in the
near-field. First, we show analytically that enhancement of radiative
recombination is a natural consequence of operating in the near-field. Second,
we note that, owing to photon recycling and minimal radiation leakage in
near-field operation, the PV cell used in near-field TPV systems can be much
thinner compared to those used in solar PV systems. Since non-radiative
recombination is a volumetric effect, use of a thinner cell reduces
non-radiative losses per unit area. The combination of these two opportunities
leads to increasingly large values of Voc as the TPV vacuum gap decreases.
Hence, although operation in the near-field was previously perceived to be
beneficial for electrical power density enhancement, here, we emphasize that
thin-film near-field TPVs are also significantly advantageous in terms of Voc
and consequently conversion efficiency as well as power density. We provide
numerical results for an InAs-based thin-film TPV that exhibits efficiency >
50% at an emitter temperature as low as 1100 K.

(TRSB) have long been sought in many quantum systems, including materials with
anomalous Hall effect (AHE), cuprate high temperature superconductors, Iridates
and so on. However, experimentally identifying such a phase transition is
extremely challenging because the transition is hidden from many experimental
probes. Here, using zero-field muon spin relaxation (ZF-$\mu$SR) technique, we
observe strong TRSB signals below 70 K in the newly discovered kagome
superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. The TRSB state emerges from the 2 x 2 charge
density wave (CDW) phase present below ~ 95 K. By carrying out optical
second-harmonic generation (SHG) experiments, we also find that inversion
symmetry is maintained in the temperature range of interest. Combining all the
experimental results and symmetry constraints, we conclude that the interlayer
coupled chiral flux phase (CFP) is the most promising candidate for the TRSB
state among all theoretical proposals of orbital current orders. Thus, this
prototypical kagome metal CsV3Sb5 can be a platform to establish a TRSB
current-ordered state and explore its relationship with CDW, giant AHE, and
superconductivity.

problems must be overcome. Firstly, humans do not consistently agree on what is
or is not ethical. Second, contemporary AI and machine learning methods tend to
be blunt instruments which either search for solutions within the bounds of
predefined rules, or mimic behaviour. An ethical AI must be capable of
inferring unspoken rules, interpreting nuance and context, possess and be able
to infer intent, and explain not just its actions but its intent. Using
enactivism, semiotics, perceptual symbol systems and symbol emergence, we
specify an agent that learns not just arbitrary relations between signs but
their meaning in terms of the perceptual states of its sensorimotor system.
Subsequently it can learn what is meant by a sentence and infer the intent of
others in terms of its own experiences. It has malleable intent because the
meaning of symbols changes as it learns, and its intent is represented
symbolically as a goal. As such it may learn a concept of what is most likely
to be considered ethical by the majority within a population of humans, which
may then be used as a goal. The meaning of abstract symbols is expressed using
perceptual symbols of raw sensorimotor stimuli as the weakest (consistent with
Ockham's Razor) necessary and sufficient concept, an intensional definition
learned from an ostensive definition, from which the extensional definition or
category of all ethical decisions may be obtained. Because these abstract
symbols are the same for both situation and response, the same symbol is used
when either performing or observing an action. This is akin to mirror neurons
in the human brain. Mirror symbols may allow the agent to empathise, because
its own experiences are associated with the symbol, which is also associated
with the observation of another agent experiencing something that symbol
represents.

greatly improved with convolutional neural networks (CNN). There, however, are
a number of limitations identified in CNN models, such as limited
interpretability and high complexity, thus limiting their use in clinical
practice. In this work, to address the limitations, we propose a lightweight
and interpretable machine learning model, successive subspace learning with the
subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab) transform, for accurate and
efficient segmentation from cine MRI. Specifically, our segmentation framework
is comprised of the following steps: (1) sequential expansion of near-to-far
neighborhood at different resolutions; (2) channel-wise subspace approximation
using the Saab transform for unsupervised dimension reduction; (3) class-wise
entropy guided feature selection for supervised dimension reduction; (4)
concatenation of features and pixel-wise classification with gradient boost;
and (5) conditional random field for post-processing. Experimental results on
the ACDC 2017 segmentation database, showed that our framework performed better
than state-of-the-art U-Net models with 200$\times$ fewer parameters in
delineating the left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardium, thus showing
its potential to be used in clinical practice.

through micro-and mini-channels with periodic arrays of offset strip fins is
analyzed. The friction factor is studied numerically on a unit cell of the
array for Reynolds numbers ranging from 1 to 600, and fin height-to-length
ratios below 1. It is shown that the friction factor correlations from the
literature, which primarily focus on larger conventional offset strip fin
geometries in the transitional flow regime, do not predict the correct trends
for laminar flow in micro-and mini-channels. Therefore, a new friction factor
correlation for micro-and mini-channels with offset strip fin arrays is
constructed from an extensive set of numerical simulations through a
least-squares fitting procedure. The suitability of this new correlation is
further supported by means of the Bayesian approach for parameter estimation
and model validation. The correlation predicts an inversely linear relationship
between the friction factor and the Reynolds number, in accordance with our
observation that a strong inertia regime prevails over nearly the entire range
of investigated Reynolds numbers. Yet, through a more detailed analysis, also
the presence of a weak inertia regime and a transitional regime is identified,
and the transitions from the strong inertia regime are quantified by means of
two critical Reynolds numbers. Finally, the new correlation also incorporates
the asymptotic trends that are observed for each geometrical parameter of the
offset strip fin array, and whose origins are discussed from a physical
perspective.

possibilities that can explain the fine-tuning problems of the Universe. It
simply claims that ""the coupling constants of a theory are tuned to one of the
multi-critical points, where some of the extrema of the effective potential are
degenerate."" One of the simplest examples is the vanishing of the second
derivative of the effective potential around a minimum. This corresponds to the
so-called classical conformality, because it implies that the renormalized mass
$m^2$ vanishes. More generally, the form of the effective potential of a model
depends on several coupling constants, and we should sweep them to find all the
multi-critical points. In this paper, we study the multi-critical points of a
general scalar field $\phi$ at one-loop level under the circumstance that the
vacuum expectation values of the other fields are all zero. For simplicity, we
also assume that the other fields are either massless or so heavy that they do
not contribute to the low energy effective potential of $\phi$. This assumption
makes our discussion very simple because the resultant one-loop effective
potential is parametrized by only four effective couplings. Although our
analysis is not completely general because of the assumption, it still can be
widely applicable to many models of the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism and its
generalizations. After classifying the multi-critical points at low-energy
scales, we will briefly mention the possibility of criticalities at high-energy
scales and their implications for cosmology.

most basic definition of the watt -- energy, which is traceable to Planck's
constant $h$, emitted per unit of time. This time is in turn traceable to the
unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom
$\Delta\nu_\mathrm{Cs}$; hence, FPC comprises a simple and elegant way to
realize the watt. In this spirit, single-photon emission and detection at known

nowadays power standards are only traceable to electrical units, i.e., volt and
ohm. In this letter, we demonstrate the feasibility of an alternative proposal

(integer) quasiparticles (qps) per cycle to both leads with discrete energies
close to their superconducting gap $\Delta$, even at zero drain-source voltage.

description of the distribution function of the system. This model has been
studied both in equilibrium and out of equilibrium. In the equilibrium,
analytical solutions have been found for internal energy per particle and
temperature using standard procedures through statistical mechanics such as the
calculation of the partition function in the canonical ensemble and the
calculation of the number of microstates accessible in the microcanonical
ensemble. The results indicate that there is an equivalence of ensembles.
Additionally, we found the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) equilibrium distribution, which
coincides with the analytical results of the canonical and microcanonical
ensembles and molecular dynamics simulations. Then we focused on describing the
Quasi-Stationary-States (QSS) present in this system, by means of molecular
dynamics simulations. Two types of QSS states are found out of equilibrium. For
its description, a combination of two techniques is used; the methods of
molecular dynamics and stationary solutions of the Vlasov equation associated
with the equations of motion of the system. From molecular we describe the
marginal distributions in moments and orientations, which were describe
anaytically by means of stationary solutions of Vlasov equation. The stationary
solutions tested in this thesis correspond to distribution functions of the
q-exponential type. In particular, it is found that one of these solutions
describes precisely the marginal distributions of the moments and the
orientations of one of the QSS states found with the molecular dynamics.

industry of consumer goods for personal care, a very competitive market in
which the good customer service level and the cost management show up in the
competition for the clients. In this research, a complex operational
environment composed of unrelated parallel machines with limited production
capacity and sequence-dependent setup times and costs is studied. There is also
a limited finished-goods storage capacity, a characteristic not found in the
literature. Backordering is allowed but it is extremely undesirable. The
problem is described through a mixed integer linear programming formulation.
Since the problem is NP-hard, relax-and-fix heuristics with hybrid partitioning
strategies are investigated. Computational experiments with randomly generated
and also with real-world instances are presented. The results show the efficacy
and efficiency of the proposed approaches. Compared to current solutions used
by the company, the best proposed strategies yield results with substantially
lower costs, primarily from the reduction in inventory levels and better
allocation of production batches on the machines.

spectral functions from analytically continued functional renormalization group
(aFRG) flow equations. As a particularly straightforward one we propose to
include parametrizations of self-energies based on explicit analytic one-loop
expressions. To exemplify this scheme we calculate the spectral functions of
pion and sigma meson of the $O(4)$ model at vanishing temperature in the broken
phase. Comparing the results with those from previous aFRG calculations, we
explicitly demonstrate how self-consistency at all momenta fixes the tight
relation between particle masses and decay thresholds. In addition, the
two-point functions from our new semi-analytic FRG scheme have the desired
domain of holomorphy built in and can readily be studied in the entire
cut-complex frequency plane, on physical as well as other Riemann sheets. This
is very illustrative and allows, for example, to trace the flow of the
resonance pole of the sigma meson across an unphysical sheet. In order to
assess the limitations due to the underlying one-loop structure, we also
introduce a fully self-consistent numerical scheme based on spectral
representations with scale-dependent spectral functions. The most notable
improvement of this numerically involved calculation is that it describes the
three-particle resonance decay of an off-shell pion, $\pi^* \to
\sigma\pi\to3\pi$. Apart from this further conceptual improvement, overall
agreement with the results from the considerably simpler semi-analytic one-loop
scheme is very encouraging, however. The latter can therefore provide a sound
and practicable basis for self-consistent calculations of spectral functions in
more realistic effective theories for warm and dense matter.

of eight nearby ($< 500 $pc) star-forming regions by the JCMT Transient Survey.
We apply the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram technique to search for and characterize
variability on 295 submillimeter peaks brighter than 0.14 Jy beam$^{-1}$,
including 22 disk sources (Class II), 83 protostars (Class 0/I), and 190
starless sources. We uncover 18 secular variables, all of them protostars. No
single-epoch burst or drop events and no inherently stochastic sources are
observed. We classify the secular variables by their timescales into three
groups: Periodic, Curved, and Linear. For the Curved and Periodic cases, the
detectable fractional amplitude, with respect to mean peak brightness, is
$\sim4$ % for sources brighter than $\sim$ 0.5 Jy beam$^{-1}$. Limiting our
sample to only these bright sources, the observed variable fraction is 37 % (16
out of 43). Considering source evolution, we find a similar fraction of bright
variables for both Class 0 and Class I. Using an empirically motivated
conversion from submillimeter variability to variation in mass accretion rate,
six sources (7 % of our full sample) are predicted to have years-long accretion
events during which the excess mass accreted reaches more than 40 % above the
total quiescently accreted mass: two previously known eruptive Class I sources,
V1647 Ori and EC 53 (V371 Ser), and four Class 0 sources, HOPS 356, HOPS 373,
HOPS 383, and West 40. Considering the full protostellar ensemble, the
importance of episodic accretion on few years timescale is negligible, only a
few percent of the assembled mass. However, given that this accretion is
dominated by events of order the observing time-window, it remains uncertain as
to whether the importance of episodic events will continue to rise with
decades-long monitoring.

time-dependent phenomena associated with star formation, including accretion
rates, geometric changes in the circumstellar disks, stochastic hydromagnetic
interactions between stellar surfaces and inner disk edges, reconnections
within the stellar magnetosphere, and hot/cold spots on stellar surfaces. We
uncover and characterize $\sim$1700 variables from a sample of $\sim$5400 YSOs
in nearby low-mass star-forming regions using mid-IR light curves obtained from
the 6.5-years NEOWISE All Sky Survey. The mid-IR variability traces a wide
range of dynamical, physical, and geometrical phenomenon. We classify six types
of YSO mid-IR variability based on their light curves: secular variability
($Linear, Curved, Periodic$) and stochastic variability ($Burst, Drop,
Irregular$). YSOs in earlier evolutionary stages have higher fractions of
variables and higher amplitudes for the variability, with the recurrence
timescale of FUor-type outbursts (defined here as $\Delta$W1 or $\Delta$W2 $>1$
mag followed by inspection of candidates) of $\sim$1000 years in the early
embedded protostellar phase. Known eruptive young stars and subluminous objects
show fractions of variables similar to the fraction ($\sim55\%$) found in
typical protostars, suggesting that these two distinct types are not distinct
in variability over the 6.5-year timescale. Along with brightness variability,
we also find a diverse range of secular color variations, which can be
attributed to a competitive interplay between the variable accretion luminosity
of the central source and the variable extinction by material associated with
the accretion process.

scattering response that at first glance appears to violate the lower bounds
for the radiation quality (Q) factor of small radiators, known as the Chu
limit. Here we explore this apparent contradiction, investigating the Q factor
of the resonant modes supported by two nearly touching cylinders, and analyze
how their fractional bandwidth fares in relation to the Chu limit. We first
derive lower bounds for the radiation Q factors of two-dimensional objects of
arbitrary cross-section. We then discuss the dissipation and radiation Q
factors associated with the plasmonic resonances of a cylinder dimer as a
function of its gap size. We show that the radiation Q factor is always larger
than the minimum Q and, as long as the peaks in the scattering spectrum are
well separated, their bandwidth is equal to the inverse of their Q factor. In
the limit of touching cylinders, the resonance spectra transition from discrete
to a continuum around an accumulation point, yielding a broadband response for
any finite level of material loss. Within any given frequency interval, the
response is the result of a multitude of plasmon resonances, each individually
obeying the Chu limit. Nevertheless, the connection between the Q factor and
the overall bandwidth of the scattering response is lost. Our study sheds light
onto the exotic resonant phenomena emerging when plasmonic materials are shaped
in singular geometries, and outlines their opportunities and limitations for
nanophotonics.

action recognition. To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art methods typically
employ the convolution operator and the dense interaction modules such as
non-local blocks. However, these methods cannot accurately fit the diverse
events in videos. On the one hand, the adopted convolutions are with fixed
scales, thus struggling with events of various scales. On the other hand, the
dense interaction modeling paradigm only achieves sub-optimal performance as
action-irrelevant parts bring additional noises for the final prediction. In
this paper, we propose a unified action recognition framework to investigate
the dynamic nature of video content by introducing the following designs.
First, when extracting local cues, we generate the spatial-temporal kernels of
dynamic-scale to adaptively fit the diverse events. Second, to accurately
aggregate these cues into a global video representation, we propose to mine the
interactions only among a few selected foreground objects by a Transformer,
which yields a sparse paradigm. We call the proposed framework as Event
Adaptive Network (EAN) because both key designs are adaptive to the input video
content. To exploit the short-term motions within local segments, we propose a
novel and efficient Latent Motion Code (LMC) module, further improving the
performance of the framework. Extensive experiments on several large-scale

Transformer (Tsformer) with Encoder-Decoder architecture for tourism demand

captures short-term dependency with decoder, and simplifies the attention

series of attention masking mechanisms. These improvements make the multi-head
attention mechanism process the input sequence according to the time

processing ability of the Encoder-Decoder architecture allows adopting the
calendar of days to be forecasted to enhance the forecasting performance.
Experiments conducted on the Jiuzhaigou valley and Siguniang mountain tourism
demand datasets with other nine baseline methods indicate that the proposed
Tsformer outperformed all baseline models in the short-term and long-term
tourism demand forecasting tasks. Moreover, ablation studies demonstrate that
the adoption of the calendar of days to be forecasted contributes to the
forecasting performance of the proposed Tsformer. For better interpretability,
the attention weight matrix visualization is performed. It indicates that the
Tsformer concentrates on seasonal features and days close to days to be
forecast in short-term forecasting.

optimization. Such optimization requires us to account for uncertainties
expressed in terms of compli-cated, high-dimensional probability distributions,
for which only samples or data might be available. However, using data or
samples often degrades the computational efficiency, particularly as the
conventional failure probability is estimated using the indicator function
whose gradient is not defined at zero. To address this issue, by leveraging the
buffered failure probability, the paper develops the buffered optimization and
reliability method (BORM) for efficient, data-driven optimization of
reliability. The proposed formulations, algo-rithms, and strategies greatly
improve the computational efficiency of the optimization and thereby address
the needs of high-dimensional and nonlinear problems. In addition, an
analytical formula is developed to estimate the reliability sensitivity, a
subject fraught with difficulty when using the conventional failure
probability. The buffered failure probability is thoroughly investigated in the
context of many different distributions, leading to a novel measure of
tail-heaviness called the buffered tail index. The efficiency and accuracy of
the proposed optimization methodology are demonstrated by three numerical
examples, which underline the unique advantages of the buffered failure
probability for data-driven reliability analysis.

generative models in a variational regularisation approach to inverse problems.
The considered regularisers penalise images that are far from the range of a
generative model that has learned to produce images similar to a training
dataset. We name this family \textit{generative regularisers}. The success of
generative regularisers depends on the quality of the generative model and so
we propose a set of desired criteria to assess generative models and guide
future research. In our numerical experiments, we evaluate three common
generative models, autoencoders, variational autoencoders and generative
adversarial networks, against our desired criteria. We also test three
different generative regularisers on the inverse problems of deblurring,
deconvolution, and tomography. We show that restricting solutions of the
inverse problem to lie exactly in the range of a generative model can give good
results but that allowing small deviations from the range of the generator
produces more consistent results.

time-translational symmetry, such that the ground state of the system evolves
in time in a periodic fashion. Even though the time-crystal concept was
introduced relatively recently, a related proposal can be traced back to Louis
de Broglie. In his thesis, de Broglie conjectured that elementary particles may
have some sort of internal clock that rules their behavior in the microscopic
world. Here, I revisit de Broglie's idea and demonstrate that a special extreme
case of classical mechanics yields in a natural way time-crystal type dynamics.
Remarkably, it is found that time-crystal particles are characterized by a spin
4-vector that has a purely kinematic origin and is determined by the binormal
of the velocity trajectory in the Bloch sphere. The dynamics of time-crystal
particles is ruled by a generalized least action principle, such that the
particle dynamically probes the nearby space and moves on average towards the
direction that minimizes the action. I apply the theory to the case of charged
particles and find that it predicts spin precession and that it provides a
simple and intuitive picture for the origin of the anomalous magnetic moment of
the electron. The classical formalism is recovered as an ""effective theory""
valid on a coarse time scale.

communication in which the two legitimate participants mutually exchange their
quantum information to each other by using a four-qubit cluster state as the
quantum channel. Recently, by utilizing a four-qubit cluster state as the
quantum channel, Kazemikhah et al. [Int. J. Theor. Phys., 60 (2021) 378] tried
to design a scheme for the mutual exchange of quantum information between two
legitimate participants. However, in the present study, it has been shown that
in their scheme the transmission of quantum information cannot be realized
because the two participants are not entangled to each other due to a trivial
conceptual mistake made by Kazemikhah et al. in the description of the quantum
channel. Here, we have shown that two legitimate participants can teleport
quantum information states to each other by using a four-qubit cluster state as
the quantum channel, provided they co-operate with each other and perform
non-local controlled phase gate operation. If both participants do not
co-operate with each other, then no one can reconstruct the information sent to
them, and therefore the exchange of information is possible only when both
participants are honest to each other.

  Prediction","Some revisons are performing",,,,"q-fin.ST cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting the future price trends of stocks is a challenging yet intriguing
problem given its critical role to help investors make profitable decisions. In
this paper, we present a collaborative temporal-relational modeling framework
for end-to-end stock trend prediction. The temporal dynamics of stocks is
firstly captured with an attention-based recurrent neural network. Then,
different from existing studies relying on the pairwise correlations between
stocks, we argue that stocks are naturally connected as a collective group, and
introduce the hypergraph structures to jointly characterize the stock
group-wise relationships of industry-belonging and fund-holding. A novel
hypergraph tri-attention network (HGTAN) is proposed to augment the hypergraph
convolutional networks with a hierarchical organization of intra-hyperedge,
inter-hyperedge, and inter-hypergraph attention modules. In this manner, HGTAN
adaptively determines the importance of nodes, hyperedges, and hypergraphs
during the information propagation among stocks, so that the potential
synergies between stock movements can be fully exploited. Extensive experiments
on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Also, the
results of investment simulation show that our approach can achieve a more
desirable risk-adjusted return. The data and codes of our work have been

results in downstream tasks. However, current pre-trained models require large
amounts of training data and have huge model sizes, which make them difficult
to apply in low-resource situations. How to obtain similar or even better
performance than a larger model under the premise of less pre-training data and
smaller model size has become an important problem. In this paper, we propose a
new Multi-stage Pre-training (MSP) method, which uses information at different
granularities from word, phrase to sentence in both texts and images to
pre-train the model in stages. We also design several different pre-training
tasks suitable for the information granularity in different stage in order to
efficiently capture the diverse knowledge from a limited corpus. We take a
Simplified LXMERT (LXMERT- S), which has only 45.9% parameters of the original
LXMERT model and 11.76% of the original pre-training data as the testbed of our
MSP method. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable
performance to the original LXMERT model in all downstream tasks, and even
outperforms the original model in Image-Text Retrieval task.

of quantum mechanics is shown to derive from a mathematical error. The
inequality, designed to assess consequences of Einstein's principle of local
realism, pertains to four polarization products on the same pair of photons
arising in a gedankenexperiment. The summands of the CHSH quantity $s(\lambda)$
inhere four symmetric functional relations which have long been neglected in
analytic considerations. Its expectation $E[s(\lambda)]$ is not the sum of four
``marginal'' expectations from a joint distribution, as quantum theory
explicitly avoids such a specification. Rather, $E[s(\lambda)]$ has four
distinct representations as the sum of three expectations of polarization
products plus the expectation of a fourth which is restricted to equal a
function value determined by the other three. Analysis using Bruno de Finetti's
fundamental theorem of prevision (FTP) yields only a bound for $E(s)$ within
$(1.1213, 2]$, surely not $2\sqrt{2}$ at all. The 4-D polytope of cohering
joint $P_{++}$ probabilities at the four stipulated angle settings are
displayed as passing through 3-D space. Aspect's ``estimation'' is based on
polarization products from different photon pairs that do not have embedded
within them the inhering functional relations. When you do actively embed the
restrictions into Aspect's estimation procedure, it yields an estimate of
1.7667, although this is not and cannot be definitive.
