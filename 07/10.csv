is based on extremum-seeking approach that uses only local measurements to
minimize the network power losses. To prove that the proposed extremum-seeking

the voltage within the pre-specific limits even during highly variable DER

use them as a post-processing filter mechanism to the object detection pipeline

this result, we conclude that gradient uncertainty adds orthogonal information

proven to be crucial in tackling increasingly complex tasks, such as 3D
detection or instance segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches for image-based
detection tasks tackle this complexity by operating in a cascaded fashion: they
first extract a 2D bounding box based on which additional attributes, e.g.
instance masks, are inferred. While these methods perform well, a key challenge
remains the lack of accurate and cheap annotations for the growing variety of
tasks. Synthetic data presents a promising solution but, despite the effort in
domain adaptation research, the gap between synthetic and real data remains an
open problem. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised domain adaptation
setting which exploits the structure of cascaded detection tasks. In
particular, we learn to infer the attributes solely from the source domain
while leveraging 2D bounding boxes as weak labels in both domains to explain
the domain shift. We further encourage domain-invariant features through
class-wise feature alignment using ground-truth class information, which is not
available in the unsupervised setting. As our experiments demonstrate, the
approach is competitive with fully supervised settings while outperforming
unsupervised adaptation approaches by a large margin.

entropy as a general framework for inference. The discussion emphasizes the
pragmatic elements in the derivation. An epistemic notion of information is
defined in terms of its relation to the Bayesian beliefs of ideally rational

distribution is designed through an eliminative induction process. The
logarithmic relative entropy is singled out as the unique tool for updating
that (a) is of universal applicability; (b) that recognizes the value of prior
information; and (c) that recognizes the privileged role played by the notion
of independence in science. The resulting framework -- the ME method -- can
handle arbitrary priors and arbitrary constraints. It includes MaxEnt and
Bayes' rule as special cases and, therefore, it unifies entropic and Bayesian
methods into a single general inference scheme. The ME method goes beyond the
mere selection of a single posterior, but also addresses the question of how
much less probable other distributions might be, which provides a direct bridge
to the theories of fluctuations and large deviations.

nonlinear time history analyses. The efficiency indexes acquired from the
average of results for nonlinear time history and endurance time analyses were
close to each other. In this research, by assuming identical optimum slip load
for the dampers in all stories, the normalized damper strength was increased in
a number of equal steps ranging from zero to one to determine the efficiency
index of dampers in each step. Then, the optimum slip load of dampers in the
steel frames was calculated according to the minimum efficiency index of

adding optimal FDDs to the structures and investigating the effectiveness of

the original fireball model for gamma-ray burst (GRB) due to the large optical
depth ($\tau >1$) at the base of the outflow, which is supported by the
quasi-thermal components detected in several Fermi GRBs. However, which
radiation mechanism (photosphere or synchrotron) dominates in most GRB spectra
is still under hot debate. The shape of the observed photosphere spectrum from
a pure hot fireball or a pure Poynting-flux-dominated outflow has been
investigated before. In this work, we further study the photosphere spectrum
from a hybrid outflow containing both a thermal component and a magnetic
component with moderate magnetization ($\sigma_{0}=L_{P}/L_{\text{Th}}\sim
1-10$), by invoking the probability photosphere model. The high-energy spectrum
from such a hybrid outflow is a power law rather than an exponential cutoff,
which is compatible with the observed Band function in large amounts of GRBs.
Also, the distribution of the low-energy indices (corresponding to the
peak-flux spectra) is found to be quite consistent with the statistical result
for the peak-flux spectra of GRBs best-fitted by the Band function, with
similar angular profiles of structured jet in our previous works. Finally, the
observed distribution of the high-energy indices can be well understood after
considering the different magnetic acceleration (due to magnetic reconnection

superposition of two power-law contributions which imitate the emission due to
synchrotron and inverse Compton processes. The methodology adopted enables us
to constrain the photon energy down to a level where inverse Compton emission
begins to contribute. We show that this information supplemented with knowledge
of the jet Doppler factor and magnetic field strength can be used to constrain
the low-energy cutoff $\gamma_{\rm min}m_{\rm e} c^2$ of the radiating electron
distribution and the kinetic power $P_{\rm j}$ of the jet. We deduce these
quantities through a statistical fitting of the broadband spectral energy

kinetic jet power is of the order of $P_{\rm j} \sim 3\times 10^{45}$ erg

Bifurcation and transition are observed for $n > 2$ when the Higgs coupling
constant is larger than some critical value $\lambda_c$ and transitional value
$\lambda_t$, respectively. Two different branches with energy higher than the
fundamental solution are observed for both $n = 3$ and $4$. We also observed a
new branch with even higher energy for $n = 4$. Unlike other branches which
display transition behavior, the new branch corresponds to a full vortex-ring

  Dense Traffic Scenarios",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous navigation in dense traffic scenarios remains challenging for
autonomous vehicles (AVs) because the intentions of other drivers are not
directly observable and AVs have to deal with a wide range of driving
behaviors. To maneuver through dense traffic, AVs must be able to reason how
their actions affect others (interaction model) and exploit this reasoning to
navigate through dense traffic safely. This paper presents a novel framework
for interaction-aware motion planning in dense traffic scenarios. We explore
the connection between human driving behavior and their velocity changes when
interacting. Hence, we propose to learn, via deep Reinforcement Learning (RL),
an interaction-aware policy providing global guidance about the cooperativeness
of other vehicles to an optimization-based planner ensuring safety and
kinematic feasibility through constraint satisfaction. The learned policy can
reason and guide the local optimization-based planner with interactive behavior
to pro-actively merge in dense traffic while remaining safe in case the other
vehicles do not yield. We present qualitative and quantitative results in
highly interactive simulation environments (highway merging and unprotected
left turns) against two baseline approaches, a learning-based and an
optimization-based method. The presented results demonstrate that our method
significantly reduces the number of collisions and increases the success rate
with respect to both learning-based and optimization-based baselines.

along the crystalline $a$ axis on the newly discovered kagome superconductor
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. At ambient conditions, CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ shows a charge-density wave
(CDW) transition at $T_{\rm CDW}=94.5$ K and superconducts below $T_C = 3.34$
K. In our study, when the uniaxial strain $\varepsilon$ is varied from
$-0.90\%$ to $0.90\%$, $T_C$ monotonically increases by $\sim 33\%$ from 3.0 K
to 4.0 K, giving rise to the empirical relation $T_C
(\varepsilon)=3.4+0.56\varepsilon+0.12\varepsilon^2$. On the other hand, for
$\varepsilon$ changing from $-0.76\%$ to $1.26\%$, $T_{\rm CDW}$ decreases
monotonically by $\sim 10\%$ from 97.5 K to 87.5 K with $T_{\rm
CDW}(\varepsilon)=94.5-4.72\varepsilon-0.60\varepsilon^2$. The opposite
response of $T_C$ and $T_{\rm CDW}$ to the uniaxial strain suggests strong
competition between these two orders. Comparison with hydrostatic pressure
measurements indicate that it is the change in the $c$-axis that is responsible
for these behaviors of the CDW and superconducting transitions, and that the
explicit breaking of the sixfold rotational symmetry by strain has a negligible
effect. Combined with our first-principles calculations and phenomenological
analysis, we conclude that the enhancement in $T_C$ with decreasing $c$ is
caused primarily by the suppression of $T_{\rm CDW}$, rather than
strain-induced modifications in the bare superconducting parameters. We propose
that the sensitivity of $T_{\rm CDW}$ with respect to the changes in the
$c$-axis arises from the impact of the latter on the trilinear coupling between
the $M_1^+$ and $L_2^-$ phonon modes associated with the CDW. Overall, our work
reveals that the $c$-axis lattice parameter, which can be controlled by both
pressure and uniaxial strain, is a powerful tuning knob for the phase diagram
of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.

paper, we use group-theory and density-functional theory (DFT) to derive and
solve a phenomenological Landau model for this CDW state. The DFT results
reveal three unstable phonon modes with the same in-plane momentum but
different out-of-plane momenta, whose frequencies depend strongly on the
electronic temperature. This is indicative of an electronically-driven CDW,
stabilized by features of the in-plane electronic dispersion. Motivated by the
DFT analysis, we construct a Landau free-energy expansion for coupled CDW order
parameters with wave-vectors at the $M$ and $L$ points of the hexagonal
Brillouin zone. We find an unusual trilinear term coupling these different
order parameters, which can promote the simultaneous condensation of both CDWs
even if the two modes are not nearly-degenerate. We classify the different
types of coupled multi-$\bf{Q}$ CDW orders, focusing on those that break the
sixfold rotational symmetry and lead to a unit-cell doubling along all three

in parameter space, characterized by large nonlinear Landau coefficients, where
these phases - dubbed staggered tri-hexagonal and staggered Star-of-David - are

any local order parameter. In the framework of Projected Entangled Pair
States(PEPS), topological order is characterized by an entanglement symmetry of
the local tensor which describes the model. This symmetry can take the form of
a tensor product of group representations, or in the more general case a
correlated symmetry action in the form of a Matrix Product Operator(MPO), which
encompasses all string-net models. Among other things, these entanglement
symmetries allow for the description of ground states and anyon excitations.
Recently, the idea has been put forward to use those symmetries and the anyonic
objects they describe as order parameters for probing topological phase
transitions, and the applicability of this idea has been demonstrated for
Abelian groups. In this paper, we extend this construction to the domain of
non-Abelian models with MPO symmetries, and use it to study the breakdown of
topological order in the double Fibonacci (DFib) string-net and its Galois
conjugate, the non-hermitian double Yang-Lee (DYL) string-net. We start by
showing how to construct topological order parameters for condensation and
deconfinement of anyons using the MPO symmetries. Subsequently, we set up
interpolations from the DFib and the DYL model to the trivial phase, and show
that these can be mapped to certain restricted solid on solid(RSOS) models,
which are equivalent to the $((5\pm\sqrt{5})/2)$-state Potts model,
respectively. The known exact solutions of the statistical models allow us to
locate the critical points, and to predict the critical exponents for the order
parameters. We complement this by numerical study of the phase transitions,
which fully confirms our theoretical predictions; remarkably, we find that both
models exhibit a duality between the order parameters for condensation and
deconfinement.

computationally inexpensive representations of higher-order dynamical systems.
Using these representations, ROMs can efficiently model flow fields while using
significantly lesser parameters. Conventional ROMs accomplish this by linearly
projecting higher-order manifolds to lower-dimensional space using
dimensionality reduction techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
(POD). In this work, we develop a novel deep learning framework DL-ROM (Deep
Learning - Reduced Order Modelling) to create a neural network capable of
non-linear projections to reduced order states. We then use the learned reduced
state to efficiently predict future time steps of the simulation using 3D
Autoencoder and 3D U-Net based architectures. Our model DL-ROM is able to
create highly accurate reconstructions from the learned ROM and is thus able to
efficiently predict future time steps by temporally traversing in the learned
reduced state. All of this is achieved without ground truth supervision or
needing to iteratively solve the expensive Navier-Stokes(NS) equations thereby
resulting in massive computational savings. To test the effectiveness and
performance of our approach, we evaluate our implementation on five different
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets using reconstruction performance
and computational runtime metrics. DL-ROM can reduce the computational runtimes
of iterative solvers by nearly two orders of magnitude while maintaining an
acceptable error threshold.

fields such as climate modeling, biophysics, molecular dynamics, or finance.
The generalized Langevin equation (GLE), given naturally by the Mori-Zwanzig
projection formalism, is a frequently used model including memory effects. In
applications, a specific form of the GLE is most often obtained on a
data-driven basis. Here, Bayesian estimation has the advantage of providing
both suitable model parameters and their credibility in a straightforward way.
It can be implemented in the approximating case of white noise, which, far from
thermodynamic equilibrium, is consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem. However, the exploration of the posterior, which is done via Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling, is numerically expensive, which makes the analysis
of large data sets unfeasible. In this work, we discuss an efficient
implementation of Bayesian estimation of the GLE based on a piecewise constant
approximation of the drift and diffusion functions of the model. In this case,
the characteristics of the data are represented by only a few coefficients, so
that the numerical cost of the procedure is significantly reduced and
independent of the length of the data set. Further, we propose a modification
of the memory term of the GLE, leading to an equivalent model with an emphasis
on the impact of trends, which ensures that an estimate of the standard
Langevin equation provides an effective initial guess for the GLE. We
illustrate the capabilities of both the method and the model by an example from
turbulence.

quantum electrodynamics in one space dimension with massive charged fermions.
We uncover a new and previously unknown set of instantons that result in novel

These sleptons provide additional contributions to muon g-2 that can be
arranged to reconcile theory and experiment. The solutions compatible with the
muon g-2 resolution typically predict light sleptons, charginos and
neutralinos. We show how these solutions can be probed during LHC-Run3. A
direct impact on the chargino mass is observed such that the chargino can be
probed up to about 800 GeV during the Run3 experiments. Despite such a direct
impact, it is still possible to realize lighter chargino masses which can
escape detection due to the chirality mixture of the lighter slepton states.
The colored squarks as well as the gluino turn out to be heavier than about 3-4

ALMA this is accomplished by using a clock at each antenna for down-conversion

future ALMA upgrades, which may involve much longer baselines and therefore

alternative and novel method of ""incoherent clocking"" (IC) wherein each ALMA
antenna performs operations (down-conversion and digitization) using its own
free-running local oscillator, its temporally-varying frequency is measured
using all digital methods relative to a common clock domain, and subsequently
the digitized data is corrected accordingly before further cross-correlation

evidence to suggest it also traces other regions undergoing energetic
processing in extragalactic environments. As part of the ALCHEMI ALMA large

starburst galaxy NGC 253 was mapped at 1.6 "" (28 pc) resolution and
characterized to understand its chemical origins. Spectral modelling of the

justified if the effective scattering rate into non-cavity modes is negligible

parameters, this requires that the optical depth of the ensemble is low, a
condition that is violated in several state-of-the-art experiments. We give

characterize each galaxy's merger history using the metric of its most dominant
merger, $M_{\rm \star,Dom}$, defined as the greater of either its total
accreted stellar mass or most massive current satellite. We find an
unexpectedly tight relationship between these galaxies' number of
$M_{V}\,{<}\,{-}9$ satellites within 150 kpc ($N_{\rm Sat}$) and $M_{\rm

galaxy mass. Using the star formation and orbital histories of satellites
around the MW and M81, we demonstrate that both likely evolved along the
$M_{\rm\star,Dom}{-}N_{\rm Sat}$ relation during their current dominant mergers

in $N_{\rm Sat}$ with $M_{\rm \star,Dom}$ across models $-$ in direct contrast
with the tightness of the empirical relation. This acute difference in the

detailed physics behind this emission is not well understood. This is in part
because high quality broadband spectra are required to precisely derive
fundamental parameters of X-ray emission such as the photon index, folding
energy, and reflection coefficient. Here we present values of such parameters
for 33 AGN observed as part of the 105 month Swift/BAT campaign and with
coordinated archival XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations. We look for
correlations between the various coronal parameters in addition to correlations
between coronal parameters and physical properties such as black hole mass and
Eddington ratio. Using our empirical model, we find good fits to almost all of
our objects. The folding energy was constrained for 30 of our 33 objects. When
comparing Seyfert 1 - 1.9 to Seyfert 2 galaxies, a K-S test indicates that
Seyfert 2 AGN have lower Eddington ratios and photon indices than Seyfert 1 -
1.9 objects with p-values of $5.6 \times 10^{-5}$ and $7.5 \times 10^{-3}$

fundamental tool to ensure unbiased and robust results in observational
cosmology. In particular, mock galaxy catalogs are a crucial resource to
achieve these goals in the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) in
the clustering of galaxies. Here we present a set of 1952 galaxy mock catalogs
designed to mimic the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 BAO sample over its full
photometric redshift range $0.6<z_{\rm photo}<1.1$. The mocks are based upon
488 ICE-COLA fast $N$-body simulations of full-sky light cones and were created
by populating halos with galaxies, using a hybrid halo occupation distribution
- halo abundance matching model. This model has ten free parameters, which were
determined, for the first time, using an automatic likelihood minimization
procedure. We also introduced a novel technique to assign photometric redshift
for simulated galaxies, following a two-dimensional probability distribution
with VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) data. The calibration
was designed to match the observed abundance of galaxies as a function of
photometric redshift, the distribution of photometric redshift errors, and the
clustering amplitude on scales smaller than those used for BAO measurements. An
exhaustive analysis was done to ensure that the mocks reproduce the input
properties. Finally, mocks were tested by comparing the angular correlation
function $w(\theta)$, angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, and projected clustering
$\xi_p(r_\perp)$ to theoretical predictions and data. The impact of volume
replication in the estimate of the covariance is also investigated. The success
in accurately reproducing the photometric redshift uncertainties and the galaxy
clustering as a function of redshift render this mock creation pipeline as a
benchmark for future analyses of photometric galaxy surveys.

and temporally correlated noise source called speckles. Suppression of speckle
noise is the key goal of wavefront control and adaptive optics (AO),
coronagraphy, and a host of post-processing techniques. Speckles average at a
rate set by the statistical speckle lifetime, and speckle-limited integration
time in long exposures is directly proportional to this lifetime. As progress
continues in post-coronagraph wavefront control, residual atmospheric speckles
will become the limiting noise source in high-contrast imaging, so a complete
understanding of their statistical behavior is crucial to optimizing
high-contrast imaging instruments. Here we present a novel power spectral
density (PSD) method for calculating the lifetime, and develop a semi-analytic
method for predicting intensity PSDs behind a coronagraph. Considering a
frozen-flow turbulence model, we analyze the residual atmosphere speckle
lifetimes in a MagAO-X-like AO system as well as 25--39 m giant segmented
mirror telescope (GSMT) scale systems. We find that standard AO control
shortens atmospheric speckle lifetime from ~130 ms to ~50 ms, and predictive
control will further shorten the lifetime to ~20 ms on 6.5 m MagAO-X. We find
that speckle lifetimes vary with diameter, wind speed, seeing, and location
within the AO control region. On bright stars lifetimes remain within a rough
range of ~20 ms to ~100 ms. Due to control system dynamics there are no simple
scaling laws which apply across a wide range of system characteristics.
Finally, we use these results to argue that telemetry-based post-processing
should enable ground-based telescopes to achieve the photon-noise limit in
high-contrast imaging.

allowing for the inference of eigenvalues of exponentially-large sparse
matrices.The maximum rate at which these eigenvalues may be learned, --known as
the Heisenberg limit--, is constrained by bounds on the circuit complexity
required to simulate an arbitrary Hamiltonian. Single-control qubit variants of
quantum phase estimation that do not require coherence between experiments have
garnered interest in recent years due to lower circuit depth and minimal qubit
overhead. In this work we show that these methods can achieve the Heisenberg
limit, {\em also} when one is unable to prepare eigenstates of the system.
Given a quantum subroutine which provides samples of a `phase function'
$g(k)=\sum_j A_j e^{i \phi_j k}$ with unknown eigenphases $\phi_j$ and overlaps
$A_j$ at quantum cost $O(k)$, we show how to estimate the phases $\{\phi_j\}$
with (root-mean-square) error $\delta$ for total quantum cost
$T=O(\delta^{-1})$. Our scheme combines the idea of Heisenberg-limited
multi-order quantum phase estimation for a single eigenvalue phase [Higgins et
al (2009) and Kimmel et al (2015)] with subroutines with so-called dense
quantum phase estimation which uses classical processing via time-series
analysis for the QEEP problem [Somma (2019)] or the matrix pencil method. For
our algorithm which adaptively fixes the choice for $k$ in $g(k)$ we prove
Heisenberg-limited scaling when we use the time-series/QEEP subroutine. We
present numerical evidence that using the matrix pencil technique the algorithm
can achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling as well.

hydro-particle-mesh (HPM) algorithm for efficient and rapid simulations of gas

(1998) to expand the scope of its application from the lower-density
intergalactic medium (IGM) to the higher-density intracluster medium (ICM).
While the original algorithm tracks only one effective particle species, the
updated version separately tracks the gas and dark matter particles as they do
not exactly trace each other on small scales. For the approximate hydrodynamics
solver, the pressure term in the gas equations of motion is calculated using
robust physical models. In particular, we use a dark matter halo model, ICM
pressure profile, and IGM temperature-density relation, all of which can be
systematically varied for parameter-space studies. We show that the HYPER
simulation results are in good agreement with the halo model expectations for
the density, temperature, and pressure radial profiles. Simulated galaxy
cluster scaling relations for Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) and X-ray observables are
also in good agreement with mean predictions, with scatter comparable to that
found in hydrodynamic simulations. HYPER also produces lightcone catalogs of
dark matter halos and full-sky tomographic maps of the lensing convergence, SZ
effect, and X-ray emission. These simulation products are useful for testing
data analysis pipelines, generating training data for machine learning,
understanding selection and systematic effects, and for interpreting
astrophysical and cosmological constraints.

accelerates gas, occur in many astrophysical environments. Almost all previous
numerical studies of these systems have assumed that the dust was
perfectly-coupled to the gas. However, it has recently been shown that the dust
in these systems is unstable to a large class of resonant drag instabilities
(RDIs) which de-couple the dust and gas dynamics and could qualitatively change
the nonlinear outcome of these outflows. We present the first simulations of
radiation-dust driven outflows in stratified, inhomogeneous media, including
explicit grain dynamics and a realistic spectrum of grain sizes and charge,
magnetic fields and Lorentz forces on grains (which dramatically enhance the
RDIs), Coulomb and Epstein drag forces, and explicit radiation transport
allowing for different grain absorption and scattering properties. In this
paper we consider conditions resembling giant molecular clouds (GMCs), HII
regions, and distributed starbursts, where optical depths are modest,
single-scattering effects dominate radiation-dust coupling, Lorentz forces
dominate over drag on grains, and the fastest-growing RDIs are similar, such as
magnetosonic and fast-gyro RDIs. These RDIs generically produce strong
size-dependent dust clustering, growing nonlinear on timescales that are much
shorter than the characteristic times of the outflow. The instabilities produce
filamentary and plume-like or 'horsehead' nebular morphologies that are
remarkably similar to observed dust structures in GMCs and HII regions.
Additionally, in some cases they strongly alter the magnetic field structure
and topology relative to filaments. Despite driving strong micro-scale dust
clumping which leaves some gas behind, an order-unity fraction of the gas is
always efficiently entrained by dust.

of parallax in six pulsars. The prominent Shapiro delay of PSR J1125$-$6014
implies a neutron star mass of $M_p = 1.5 \pm 0.2 M_\odot$ (68% credibility

function that is separable in the sequence variables and that can be minimized
parallelly. To evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm we perform
the numerical experiments for different sequence lengths and confirm that our

minimizer of the ISL metric. Our proposed algorithm is also computationally
efficient due to its ease of implementation using the FFT, IFFT operations in a

clearly separate the profiles of the clusters, whose centres are separated by
$37'$, from the gas associated with the filament. A model that fits for only
the two clusters is ruled out compared to one that includes a bridge component
at $>5\sigma$. Using a gas temperature determined from Suzaku X-ray data, we
infer a total mass of $(3.3\pm0.7)\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ associated
with the filament, comprising about $8\%$ of the entire Abell 399-Abell 401

favoured model has a width transverse to the axis joining the clusters of
${\sim}1.9\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. When combined with the Suzaku data, we find a gas
density of $(0.88\pm0.24)\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, considerably lower
than previously reported. We show that this can be fully explained by a
geometry in which the axis joining Abell 399 and Abell 401 has a large
component along the line of sight, such that the distance between the clusters
is significantly greater than the $3.2\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ projected separation on
the plane of the sky. Finally, we present initial results from higher

the maximal energies achievable for UHECR nuclei and derive constraints on the

background. We find that ll-GRBs are potential targets for multiwavelength
studies and in reach for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and
optical/UV instruments. For comparable sub-MeV emission and similar dynamical
evolution of the outflow, weak (strong) magnetic fields induce high (low)
fluxes in the VHE regime and low (high) fluxes in the optical. VHE emission may
be suppressed by $\gamma \gamma$-absorption close to the engine or interactions
with the extragalactic background light for redshifts $z > 0.1$. For UHECRs,
the maximal energies of iron nuclei (protons) can be as high as $\simeq
10^{11}$~GeV ($10^{10}$~GeV) if the magnetic energy density is large (and the
VHE component is correspondingly weak). These high energies are possible by
decoupling the production regions of UHECR and gamma-rays in our multizone

presented slower or faster than usual. Although deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) are extremely powerful in extracting information from time
series, they require explicit training to generalize to different time scales.
This paper presents a deep CNN that incorporates a temporal representation
inspired by recent findings from neuroscience. In the mammalian brain, time is
represented by populations of neurons with temporal receptive fields.
Critically, the peaks of the receptive fields form a geometric series, such
that the population codes a set of temporal basis functions over log time.
Because memory for the recent past is a function of log time, rescaling the
input results in translation of the memory. The Scale-Invariant Temporal
History Convolution network (SITHCon) builds a convolutional layer over this
logarithmically-distributed temporal memory. A max-pool operation results in a
network that is invariant to rescalings of time modulo edge effects. We compare
performance of SITHCon to a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN). Although both
networks can learn classification and regression problems on both univariate
and multivariate time series f(t), only SITHCon generalizes to rescalings
f(at). This property, inspired by findings from contemporary neuroscience and
consistent with findings from cognitive psychology, may enable networks that
learn with fewer training examples, fewer weights and that generalize more
robustly to out of sample data.

clump with similar masses and metallicity: $M\simeq 1.1\pm0.2{\rm M_\odot}$ and
[Fe/H] $\simeq-0.3\pm0.3$. Li enrichment over the Li abundance present in a
star's predecessor at the tip of the red giant branch likely occurs in all
these red clump stars. Examination of the elemental abundances (C to Eu) in the
GALAH catalogue shows no anomalous abundances in red clump giants and, in
particular, no dependence on the Li abundance, which ranges over at least five
dex. Lithium synthesis is attributed to the He-core flash occurring in stars at
the tip of the red giant branch. Models from the Modules for Experiments in
Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) match the observed evolution of these stars along
the red giant branch and to the red clump but only at the low effective
temperature end of the observed spread of red clump giants. Run of Li abundance
on the red giant branch is fairly well reproduced by MESA models. A speculation
is presented that the series of He-core flashes not only leads to $^7$Li
synthesis from a star's internal reservoir of $^3$He but also may lead to
internal restructuring leading to the observed effective temperature spread of
red clump stars at about a constant luminosity. Giants exhibiting marked Li
enrichments are not found at other evolutionary phases and, in particular, not
directly associated with the luminosity bump on the red giant branch for which
the Li abundance increase does not exceed 0.3 dex.

approached with two steps: calibrating the parameters and then solving an
optimization problem. Yet, the two-step procedure sometimes encounter the
""error maximization"" problem where inaccuracy in parameter estimation
translates to unwise allocation decisions. In this paper, we combine the
prediction and optimization tasks in a single feed-forward neural network and
implement an end-to-end approach, where we learn the portfolio allocation
directly from the input features. Two end-to-end portfolio constructions are
included: a model-free network and a model-based network. The model-free
approach is seen as a black-box, whereas in the model-based approach, we learn
the optimal risk contribution on the assets and solve the allocation with an
implicit optimization layer embedded in the neural network. The model-based
end-to-end framework provides robust performance in the out-of-sample
(2017-2021) tests when maximizing Sharpe ratio is used as the training
objective function, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 1.16 when nominal risk parity
yields 0.79 and equal-weight fix-mix yields 0.83. Noticing that risk-based
portfolios can be sensitive to the underlying asset universe, we develop an
asset selection mechanism embedded in the neural network with stochastic gates,
in order to prevent the portfolio being hurt by the low-volatility assets with
low returns. The gated end-to-end with filter outperforms the nominal
risk-parity benchmarks with naive filtering mechanism, boosting the Sharpe
ratio of the out-of-sample period (2017-2021) to 1.24 in the market data.

holes (BHs) between roughly $50\,M_\odot$ and $100\,M_\odot$, while, above the
range accessible through massive star evolution, intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs)
still remain elusive. Repeated mergers of binary BHs, detectable via
gravitational wave emission with the current LIGO/Virgo/Kagra interferometers
and future detectors such as LISA or the Einstein Telescope, can form both
mass-gap BHs and IMBHs. Here we explore the possibility that mass-gap BHs and
IMBHs are born as a result of successive BH mergers in dense star clusters. In
particular, nuclear star clusters at the centers of galaxies have deep enough
potential wells to retain most of the BH merger products after they receive
significant recoil kicks due to anisotropic emission of gravitational
radiation. We show that a massive stellar BH seed can easily grow to $\sim 10^3
- 10^4\,M_\odot$ as a result of repeated mergers with other smaller BHs. We
find that lowering the cluster metallicity leads to larger final BH masses. We
also show that the growing BH spin tends to decrease in magnitude with the
number of mergers, so that a negative correlation exists between final mass and
spin of the resulting IMBHs. Assumptions about the birth spins of stellar BHs
affect our results significantly, with low birth spins leading to the
production of a larger population of massive BHs.

requires reforming the methodology of algorithmic fairness. First, I diagnose
the problems of the current methodology for algorithmic fairness, which I call
""formal algorithmic fairness."" Because formal algorithmic fairness restricts
analysis to isolated decision-making procedures, it leads to the impossibility
of fairness and to models that exacerbate oppression despite appearing ""fair.""
Second, I draw on theories of substantive equality from law and philosophy to
propose an alternative methodology, which I call ""substantive algorithmic
fairness."" Because substantive algorithmic fairness takes a more expansive
scope of analysis, it enables an escape from the impossibility of fairness and
provides a rigorous guide for alleviating injustice with algorithms. In sum,
substantive algorithmic fairness presents a new direction for algorithmic
fairness: away from formal mathematical models of ""fair"" decision-making and

steps in computer assisted surgery. Recent work has shown that depth estimation

However, most recent depth estimation models were trained on datasets with

making it hard to apply supervised depth estimation to real surgical
applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose SADepth, a new
self-supervised depth estimation method based on Generative Adversarial
Networks. It consists of an encoder-decoder generator and a discriminator to
incorporate geometry constraints during training. Multi-scale outputs from the
generator help to solve the local minima caused by the photometric reprojection
loss, while the adversarial learning improves the framework generation quality.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that SADepth outperforms
recent state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin, and reduces the

aims to develop an investigation to identify the most critical parameters in
the dynamic behavior of asymmetric bistable energy harvesters with nonlinear
piezoelectric coupling, considering the variability of their physical and
excitation properties. For this purpose, a global sensitivity analysis based on
orthogonal variance decomposition, employing Sobol indices, is performed to
quantify the effect of the harvester parameters on the variance of the
recovered power. This technique quantifies the variance concerning each
parameter individually and collectively regarding the total variation of the
model. The results indicate that the frequency and amplitude of excitation,
asymmetric terms and electrical proprieties of the piezoelectric coupling are
the most critical parameters that affect the mean power harvested. It is also
shown that the order of importance of the parameters can change according to
the stability of the harvester's dynamic response. In this way, a better
understanding of the system under analysis is obtained since the study allows
the identification of vital parameters that rule the change of dynamic behavior
and therefore constitutes a powerful tool in the robust design, optimization,

several challenges of processing deeper networks and complex models, which

aiming at distributing inference requests to a swarm of resource-constrained

decision-making latency. We formulate the model as an optimization problem that
minimizes the latency between acquiring images and making the final decisions.
The formulated optimization solution is an NP-hard problem. Hence it is not
adequate for online resource allocation. Therefore, we introduce an online
heuristic solution, namely DistInference, to find the layers placement strategy
that gives the best latency among the available UAVs. The proposed approach is
general enough to be used for different low decision-latency applications as
well as for all CNN types organized into the pipeline of layers (e.g., VGG) or

dimensionless time variable, the resulting dynamical system is studied. The
main difficulties arising in the standard dynamical systems approach, where
expansion normalized dynamical variables are usually adopted, are due to the
oscillations entering the nonlinear system through the Klein-Gordon (KG)
equations. This motivates the analysis of the oscillations using methods from
the theory of averaging nonlinear dynamical systems. We prove that
time-dependent systems, and their corresponding time-averaged versions, have
the same late-time dynamics. Then, we study the time-averaged system using
standard techniques of dynamical systems. We present numerical simulations as
evidence of such behavior.

models (like Variational Autoencoders) often require simultaneously training a
generative direction along with an inferential(encoding) direction, which
approximates the posterior distribution over the latent variables. Thus, the
question arises: how complex does the inferential model need to be, in order to
be able to accurately model the posterior distribution of a given generative
model?
  In this paper, we identify an important property of the generative map
impacting the required size of the encoder. We show that if the generative map
is ""strongly invertible"" (in a sense we suitably formalize), the inferential
model need not be much more complex. Conversely, we prove that there exist
non-invertible generative maps, for which the encoding direction needs to be
exponentially larger (under standard assumptions in computational complexity).
Importantly, we do not require the generative model to be layerwise invertible,
which a lot of the related literature assumes and isn't satisfied by many
architectures used in practice (e.g. convolution and pooling based networks).
Thus, we provide theoretical support for the empirical wisdom that learning
deep generative models is harder when data lies on a low-dimensional manifold.

of such thin sheets freely suspended in fluid. In this work, we study the
dynamics of freely suspended soft sheets in uniaxial extensional flow. Elastic
sheets are modeled with a continuum model that accounts for in-plane
deformation and out-of-plane bending, and the fluid motion is computed using
the method of regularized Stokeslets. We explore two types of sheets: ""stiff""
sheets that strongly resist bending deformations and always stay flat, and
""flexible"" sheets with both in-plane and out-of plane deformability that can
wrinkle. For stiff sheets, we observe a coil-stretch-like transition, similar
to what has been observed for long-chain linear polymers under extension as
well as elastic sheets under planar extension: in a certain range of capillary
number (flow strength relative to in-plane deformability), the sheets exhibit
either a compact or a highly stretched conformation, depending on deformation
history. For flexible sheets, sheets with sufficiently small bending stiffness
wrinkle to form various conformations. Here, the compact-stretched bistability
still occurs, but is strongly modified by the wrinkling instability: a
highly-stretched planar state can become unstable and wrinkle, after which it
may dramatically shrink in length due to hydrodynamic screening associated with
wrinkling. Therefore, wrinkling renders a shift in the bistability regime. In
addition, we can predict and understand the nonlinear long-term dynamics for
some parameter regimes with linear stability analysis of the flat steady
states.

ordinal classification methods can be derived from diverse model of preferences
fulfilling the basic conditions on S and D. Two complementary assignment
procedures compose each method, which correspond through the transposition
operation and should be used complementarily. The methods work under relatively
slight conditions on the representative actions and satisfy several fundamental

momentum eigenstate does not always have the same spin polarization at the edge
as the corresponding negative momentum eigenstate. In addition, in the presence
of a magnetization pointing perpendicular to the edge, an edge charge current
is produced, which can be chiral or nonchiral depending on whether the
magnetization lies in-plane or out-of-plane. The spin polarization near the
edge develops a transverse component orthogonal to the magnetization, which is
antisymmetric between the two edges and tends to cause a noncollinear magnetic
order between the two edges. If the magnetization only occupies a region near
one edge, or in an irregular shaped quantum dot, this transverse component has
a nonzero average, rendering a gate voltage-induced magnetoelectric torque
without the need of a bias voltage. We also argue that other types of
spin-orbit coupling that can be obtained from the Rashba type through a unitary
transformation, such as the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, will have similar
effects too.

parametric reduced order modeling (PROM). In PROM, each parameter point can be
associated with a subspace, which is used for Petrov-Galerkin projections of
large system matrices. Previous efforts to approximate such functions use
interpolations on manifolds, which can be inaccurate and slow. To tackle this,
we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for subspace prediction: the
Gaussian Process Subspace regression (GPS) model. This method is extrinsic and
intrinsic at the same time: with multivariate Gaussian distributions on the
Euclidean space, it induces a joint probability model on the Grassmann
manifold, the set of fixed-dimensional subspaces. The GPS adopts a simple yet
general correlation structure, and a principled approach for model selection.
Its predictive distribution admits an analytical form, which allows for
efficient subspace prediction over the parameter space. For PROM, the GPS
provides a probabilistic prediction at a new parameter point that retains the
accuracy of local reduced models, at a computational complexity that does not
depend on system dimension, and thus is suitable for online computation. We
give four numerical examples to compare our method to subspace interpolation,
as well as two methods that interpolate local reduced models. Overall, GPS is
the most data efficient, more computationally efficient than subspace
interpolation, and gives smooth predictions with uncertainty quantification.

in 2007, vaping prevalence has surged in both adult and adolescent populations.
E-cigarettes are advertised as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes
and as a method of smoking cessation, but the U.S. government and health
professionals are concerned that e-cigarettes attract young non-smokers. Here,
we develop and analyze a dynamical systems model of competition between
traditional and electronic cigarettes for users. With this model, we predict
the change in smoking prevalence due to the introduction of vaping, and we
determine the conditions under which e-cigarettes present a net public health
benefit or harm to society.

modern edge devices. Past work developed streaming End-to-End (E2E) all-neural
speech recognizers that can run compactly on edge devices. However, E2E ASR
models are prone to overfitting and have difficulties in generalizing to unseen
testing data. Various techniques have been proposed to regularize the training
of ASR models, including layer normalization, dropout, spectrum data
augmentation and speed distortions in the inputs. In this work, we present a
simple yet effective noisy training strategy to further improve the E2E ASR
model training. By introducing random noise to the parameter space during
training, our method can produce smoother models at convergence that generalize
better. We apply noisy training to improve both dense and sparse
state-of-the-art Emformer models and observe consistent WER reduction.
Specifically, when training Emformers with 90% sparsity, we achieve 12% and 14%
WER improvements on the LibriSpeech Test-other and Test-clean data set,
respectively.

electron-neutrino ($e\nu$) pairs are produced predominantly in the process $p

positron yield as a function of their pseudorapidity constrain the slope of the
ratio of the $u$- to $d$-quark parton distributions versus the fraction of the
proton momentum carried by the quarks. This paper reports on the measurement of
the electron-charge asymmetry using the full data set recorded by the Collider
Detector at Fermilab in 2001--2011 and corresponding to 9.1~fb$^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity. The measurement significantly improves the precision of
the Tevatron constraints on the parton-distribution functions of the proton.

"2107.04679","Jan Bok","Jan Bok, Martin \v{C}ern\'y","1-convex extensions of incomplete cooperative games and the average
  value","overall improvements, 34 pages",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The model of incomplete cooperative games incorporates uncertainty into the
classical model of cooperative games by considering a partial characteristic
function. Thus the values for some of the coalitions are not known. The main
focus of this paper is the class of 1-convex cooperative games under this
framework.
  We are interested in two heavily intertwined questions. First, given an
incomplete game, in which ways can we fill in the missing values to obtain a
classical 1-convex game? Such complete games are called \emph{1-convex
extensions}. For the class of minimal incomplete games (in which precisely the
values of singletons and grand coalitions are known), we provide an answer in
terms of a description of the set of 1-convex extensions. The description
employs extreme points and extreme rays of the set.
  Second, how to determine in a rational, fair, and efficient way the payoffs
of players based only on the known values of coalitions? Based on the
description of the set of 1-convex extensions, we introduce generalisations of
three solution concepts (values) for complete games, namely the $\tau$-value,
the Shapley value and the nucleolus. We consider two variants where we compute
the centre of gravity of either extreme games or of a combination of extreme
games and extreme rays. We show that all of the generalised values coincide for
minimal incomplete games which allows to introduce the \emph{average value}.
For this value, we provide three different axiomatisations based on axiomatic
characterisations of the $\tau$-value and the Shapley value for classical
cooperative games.
  Finally, we turn our attention to \emph{incomplete games with defined upper
vector}, asking the same questions and this time arriving to different
conclusions. This provides a benchmark to test our tools and knowledge of the
average value.

learning predictions. This interest is reflected by a relatively young
literature with already dozens of algorithms aiming to generate such
explanations. These algorithms are focused on finding how features can be
modified to change the output classification. However, this rather general
objective can be achieved in different ways, which brings about the need for a
methodology to test and benchmark these algorithms. The contributions of this
work are manifold: First, a large benchmarking study of 10 algorithmic
approaches on 22 tabular datasets is performed, using 9 relevant evaluation
metrics. Second, the introduction of a novel, first of its kind, framework to
test counterfactual generation algorithms. Third, a set of objective metrics to
evaluate and compare counterfactual results. And finally, insight from the
benchmarking results that indicate which approaches obtain the best performance
on what type of dataset. This benchmarking study and framework can help
practitioners in determining which technique and building blocks most suit
their context, and can help researchers in the design and evaluation of current
and future counterfactual generation algorithms. Our findings show that,
overall, there's no single best algorithm to generate counterfactual
explanations as the performance highly depends on properties related to the
dataset, model, score and factual point specificities.

decomposed into an intersection of languages of smaller DFAs. Otherwise, A is
prime. This notion of primality was introduced by Kupferman and Mosheiff in
2013, and while they proved that we can decide whether a DFA is composite, the
precise complexity of this problem is still open, with a doubly-exponential gap
between the upper and lower bounds. In this work, we focus on permutation DFAs,
i.e., those for which the transition monoid is a group. We provide an NP
algorithm to decide whether a permutation DFA is composite, and show that the
difficulty of this problem comes from the number of non-accepting states of the
instance: we give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with the number of
rejecting states as the parameter. Moreover, we investigate the class of
commutative permutation DFAs. Their structural properties allow us to decide
compositionality in NLOGSPACE, and even in LOGSPACE if the alphabet size is
fixed. Despite this low complexity, we show that complex behaviors still arise
in this class: we provide a family of composite DFAs each requiring
polynomially many factors with respect to its size. We also consider the
variant of the problem that asks whether a DFA is k-factor composite, that is,
decomposable into k smaller DFAs, for some given integer k. We show that, for
commutative permutation DFAs, restricting the number of factors makes the
decision computationally harder, and yields a problem with tight bounds: it is
NP-complete. Finally, we show that in general, this problem is in PSPACE, and
it is in LOGSPACE for DFAs with a singleton alphabet.

extract a fragment, i.e., a supercell, out of the infinite system, and then
modifying its topology into the that of a Clifford torus which is a flat,
finite and border-less manifold. We then renormalize the distance between two
points by defining it as the Euclidean distance in the embedding space of the
Clifford torus. With our method we have been able to calculate the reference
results available in the literature with a remarkable accuracy, and at a very
low computational effort. In this work we show that our approach is robust with
respect to the shape of the supercell. In particular, we show that the Madelung
constants converge to the same values but that the convergence properties are
different. Our approach scales linearly with the number of atoms. The
calculation of Madelung constants only takes a few seconds on a laptop computer

to achieve a simpler architecture, which has shallow layers, is simple to
train, and is better suited for Edge applications, such as Internet of Things
(IoT), over traditional deep neural networks. STARE incorporates new AI
concepts such as Attention and Context, and is best suited for temporal feature
extraction and classification. We demonstrate that STARE is applicable to a
variety of applications with improved performance and lower implementation
complexity. In particular, we showed a novel way of applying a dual-loop
configuration to detection and identification of drone vs bird in a counter
Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) detection application by exploiting both spatial
(video frame) and temporal (trajectory) information. We also demonstrated that
the STARE performance approaches that of a State-of-the-Art deep neural network

a special case of Mackey Glass time series prediction. To demonstrate hardware
efficiency, we designed and developed an FPGA implementation of the STARE
algorithm to demonstrate its low-power and high-throughput operations. In
addition, we illustrate an efficient structure for integrating a massively

where a system trained on text-based MC is evaluated on an SQA task with
non-native speakers. Mismatches must be considered between text documents and
spoken responses; non-native spoken grammar and written grammar. In practical
SQA, ASR systems are used, necessitating an investigation of the impact of ASR

magnetosphere into the high-latitude E-region ionosphere along geomagnetic

molecules allow currents to flow across B, enabling the entire
magnetosphere-ionosphere current system to close. These same currents cause
strong DC electric fields in the E-region ionosphere where they drive plasma
instabilities, including the Farley-Buneman instability (FBI). These
instabilities give rise to small-scale plasma turbulence that modifies the
large-scale ionospheric conductance that, in turn, affects the evolution of the
entire near-Earth plasma environment. Also, during geomagnetic storms,
precipitating electrons of high energies, $\gtrsim$ 5 keV, frequently penetrate
down to the same regions where intense currents and E fields develop. This
research examines the effects of precipitating electrons on the generation of
the FBI and shows that, under many common conditions, it can easily suppress
the instability in a predictable manner. Therefore, we expect precipitation to
exert a significant feedback on the magnetosphere by preventing the elevated
conductivity caused by FBI driven turbulence. This suppression should be taken
into account in global modeling of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.

approaches employed are often trial and error, preventing rational design. We
demonstrate the power of large-scale electronic structure calculations with
density functional theory (DFT) to build an atlas of preferential dopant sites
for a range of M(II) and M(III) dopants in the representative III-V InP magic
sized cluster (MSC). We quantify the thermodynamic favorability of dopants,
which we identify to be both specific to the sites within the MSC (i.e.,
interior vs surface) and to the nature of the dopant atom (i.e., smaller
Ga(III) vs larger Y(III) or Sc(III)). These observations motivate development
of maps of the most and least favorable doping sites, which are consistent with
some known experimental expectations but also yield unexpected observations.
For isovalent doping (i.e., Y(III)/Sc(III) or Ga(III), we observed stronger
sensitivity of the predicted energetics to the type of ligand orientation on
the surface than to the dopant type, but divergent behavior is observed for
whether interior doping is favorable. For charge balancing with M(II) (i.e., Zn
or Cd) dopants, we show that the type of ligand removed during the doping
reaction is critical. We show that limited cooperativity with dopants up to
moderate concentrations occurs, indicating rapid single-dopant estimations of
favorability from DFT can efficiently guide rational design. Our work
emphasizes the strong importance of ligand chemistry and surface heterogeneity
in determining paths to favorable doping in quantum dots, an observation that
will be general to other III-V and II-VI quantum dot systems generally
synthesized with carboxylate ligands.

457(b), then we can make a larger deposit into the external asset (albeit for a
shorter period of time). I derive a variety of cutoff rules for optimal loan
control; in general, the investor must wait until he accumulates a certain

its association with the transient cannot be ruled out. The properties of the
host galaxy are suggestive of a massive stellar progenitor that formed at low

count modulo $m$? Can they efficiently compute MAJORITY and other symmetric
functions? When $m$ is a constant prime power, the answer is well understood:
Razborov and Smolensky proved in the 1980s that MAJORITY and $MOD_m$ require
super-polynomial-size $MOD_q$ circuits, where $q$ is any prime power not
dividing $m$. However, relatively little is known about the power of $MOD_m$
circuits for non-prime-power $m$. For example, it is still open whether every
problem in $EXP$ can be computed by depth-$3$ circuits of polynomial size and
only $MOD_6$ gates.
  We shed some light on the difficulty of proving lower bounds for $MOD_m$
circuits, by giving new upper bounds. We construct $MOD_m$ circuits computing
symmetric functions with non-prime power $m$, with size-depth tradeoffs that
beat the longstanding lower bounds for $AC^0[m]$ circuits for prime power $m$.
Our size-depth tradeoff circuits have essentially optimal dependence on $m$ and
$d$ in the exponent, under a natural circuit complexity hypothesis.
  For example, we show for every $\varepsilon > 0$ that every symmetric
function can be computed with depth-3 $MOD_m$ circuits of
$\exp(O(n^{\varepsilon}))$ size, for a constant $m$ depending only on
$\varepsilon > 0$. That is, depth-$3$ $CC^0$ circuits can compute any symmetric
function in \emph{subexponential} size. This demonstrates a significant
difference in the power of depth-$3$ $CC^0$ circuits, compared to other models:
for certain symmetric functions, depth-$3$ $AC^0$ circuits require
$2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ size [H{\aa}stad 1986], and depth-$3$ $AC^0[p^k]$
circuits (for fixed prime power $p^k$) require $2^{\Omega(n^{1/6})}$ size
[Smolensky 1987]. Even for depth-two $MOD_p \circ MOD_m$ circuits,
$2^{\Omega(n)}$ lower bounds were known [Barrington Straubing Th\'erien 1990].

The presence of clones within a project may indicate a need for refactoring,
and clones between projects are even more interesting, since code migration
takes place and violations are possible. But how is code being copied? How
prevalent is the process and on what level does it happen?
  In this general study, we attempt to shed some light on these questions by
searching for clones in a large dataset of over 23 thousand Java projects on
the level of both files and methods, and by studying the code fragments
themselves and their clone pairs. We study the size and the age of code
fragments, the prevalence of their clones, relationships between exact and
non-exact clones, as well as between method-level and file-level clones. We
also discover and describe various anomalies in the code clones that were
detected in the dataset.
  Our research shows that the copying occurs all through the years of the Java
code existence and that method-level copying is much more prevalent than
file-level copying, with only 35.4% of methods having no clones at all.
Additionally, some of the discovered anomalies can be useful for future
large-scale cloning research as they can be used for removing auto-generated
code.

graph convolutional network (GCN) and its variants have been successfully

issues of overfitting and oversmoothing, while some recent techniques like
DropEdge could alleviate these issues and thus enable the development of deep
GCN. However, training GCN models is non-trivial, as it is sensitive to the
choice of hyperparameters such as dropout rate and learning weight decay,
especially for deep GCN models. In this paper, we aim to automate the training
of GCN models through hyperparameter optimization. To be specific, we propose a
self-tuning GCN approach with an alternate training algorithm, and further
extend our approach by incorporating the population based training scheme.
Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approaches on optimizing multi-layer GCN, compared with several

by business rules. Some of these constraints define the allowable or required
values for data handled by the systems. These data constraints usually
originate from the problem domain (e.g., regulations), and developers must
write code that enforces them. Understanding how data constraints are
implemented is essential for testing, debugging, and software change.
Unfortunately, there are no widely-accepted guidelines or best practices on how
to implement data constraints.
  This paper presents an empirical study that investigates how data constraints
are implemented in Java. We study the implementation of 187 data constraints
extracted from the documentation of eight real-world Java software systems.
First, we perform a qualitative analysis of the textual description of data
constraints and identify four data constraint types. Second, we manually
identify the implementations of these data constraints and reveal that they can
be grouped into 30 implementation patterns. The analysis of these
implementation patterns indicates that developers prefer a handful of patterns
when implementing data constraints and deviations from these patterns are
associated with unusual implementation decisions or code smells. Third, we
develop a tool-assisted protocol that allows us to identify 256 additional
trace links for the data constraints implemented using the 13 most common
patterns. We find that almost half of these data constraints have multiple
enforcing statements, which are code clones of different types.

relates the two latent spaces by jointly disentangling two directions, one in
each space, such that the longitudinal changes in latent representations along
those directions are maximally correlated between modalities. We applied LCA to
analyze the longitudinal T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRIs of 679 youths

molecules by predicting their binding affinities for a biomolecular target of
interest (and potentially selectivity against undesirable anti-targets).
Statistical variance associated with such calculations, however, may undermine
the reliability of their predictions, introducing uncertainty both in ranking
candidate molecules and in benchmarking their predictive accuracy. Here, we
present a computational method that substantially improves the statistical
precision in BFE calculations for a set of ligands binding to a common receptor
by dynamically allocating computational resources to different BFE calculations
according to an optimality objective established in a previous work from our
group and extended in this work. Our method, termed Network Binding Free Energy

re-optimizing the allocations in each iteration based on the statistical
variances estimated from previous iterations. Using examples of NetBFE
calculations for protein-binding of congeneric ligand series, we demonstrate
that NetBFE approaches the optimal allocation in a small number (<= 5) of
iterations and that NetBFE reduces the statistical variance in the binding free

the ballistic and the diffusive transport regimes. Therefore, systematic
investigations have been carried out to describe the signatures of phonon
hydrodynamics via the competitive effects between grain size and temperature. A
characteristic nonlocal length associated with phonon hydrodynamics and a heat
wave propagation length has been extracted. The connections between phonon
hydrodynamics and these length scales are discussed in terms of the Knudsen
number. Further, the scaling relation of thermal conductivity as a function of
characteristic size in the intermediate size range emerges as a crucial
indicator of the strength of the hydrodynamic behavior. A ratio concerning
normal and resistive scattering rates has been employed to understand these
different scaling relations, which seems to control the strength and prominent
visibility of the collective phonon transport in GeTe. This systematic

bound principle (MBP), that is, the absolute value of its solution is uniformly
bounded for all time by certain constant under suitable initial and boundary
conditions. In this paper, we consider numerical solutions of the modified
Allen-Cahn equation with a Lagrange multiplier of nonlocal and local effects,
which not only shares the same MBP as the original Allen-Cahn equation but also
conserves the mass exactly. We reformulate the model equation with a linear
stabilizing technique, then construct first- and second-order exponential time
differencing schemes for its time integration. We prove the unconditional MBP
preservation and mass conservation of the proposed schemes in the time discrete

Various numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are also conducted to
verify the theoretical results.

discovery of rapid and quantitative chemical exchange saturation transfer
(CEST) MR fingerprinting acquisition and reconstruction protocols.
  Methods: An MR physics governed AI system was trained to generate optimized
acquisition schedules and the corresponding quantitative reconstruction
neural-network. The system (termed AutoCEST) is composed of a CEST saturation
block, a spin dynamics module, and a deep reconstruction network, all
differentiable and jointly connected. The method was validated using a variety
of chemical exchange phantoms and an in-vivo mouse brain at 9.4T.
  Results: The acquisition times for AutoCEST optimized schedules ranged from
35-71s, with a quantitative image reconstruction time of only 29 ms. The
resulting exchangeable proton concentration maps for the phantoms were in good
agreement with the known solute concentrations for AutoCEST sequences (mean
absolute error = 2.42 mM; Pearson's r=0.992 , p$<$0.0001), but not for an
unoptimized sequence (mean absolute error = 65.19 mM; Pearson's r=-0.161,
p=0.522). Similarly, improved exchange rate agreement was observed between
AutoCEST and quantification of exchange using saturation power (QUESP) methods
(mean absolute error: 35.8 Hz, Pearson's r=0.971, p$<$0.0001) compared to an
unoptimized schedule and QUESP (mean absolute error = 58.2 Hz; Pearson's
r=0.959, p$<$0.0001). The AutoCEST in-vivo mouse brain semi-solid proton
volume-fractions were lower in the cortex (12.21$\pm$1.37%) compared to the
white-matter (19.73 $\pm$ 3.30%), as expected, and the amide proton
volume-fraction and exchange rates agreed with previous reports.
  Conclusion: AutoCEST can automatically generate optimized CEST/MT acquisition
protocols that can be rapidly reconstructed into quantitative exchange
parameter maps.

an increasing number of Android malware has been developed and spread to steal
users' private information. There exists one type of malware whose benign
behaviors are developed to camouflage malicious behaviors. The malicious
component occupies a small part of the entire code of the application (app for
short), and the malicious part is strongly coupled with the benign part. In
this case, the malware may cause false negatives when malware detectors extract
features from the entire apps to conduct classification because the malicious
features of these apps may be hidden among benign features. Moreover, some
previous work aims to divide the entire app into several parts to discover the
malicious part. However, the premise of these methods to commence app partition
is that the connections between the normal part and the malicious part are
weak.
  In this paper, we call this type of malware as Android covert malware and
generate the first dataset of covert malware. To detect them, we first conduct
static analysis to extract the call graphs. Through the deep analysis on
graphs, we observe that although the correlations between the normal part and
the malicious part in these graphs are high, the degree of these correlations
has a distribution. Based on the observation, we design HomDroid to detect
covert malware by analyzing the homophily of call graphs. We identify the ideal
threshold of correlation to distinguish the normal part and the malicious part
based on the evaluation results on a dataset of 4,840 benign apps and 3,385

from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions,
which is essential for understanding physical, social, and team-play systems.
However, most existing works on modeling multi-agent interactions typically
assume that agents make independent decisions based on their observations,
ignoring the complex dependence among agents. In this paper, we propose to use
copula, a powerful statistical tool for capturing dependence among random
variables, to explicitly model the correlation and coordination in multi-agent
systems. Our proposed model is able to separately learn marginals that capture
the local behavioral patterns of each individual agent, as well as a copula
function that solely and fully captures the dependence structure among agents.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our model
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various scenarios in the action
prediction task, and is able to generate new trajectories close to expert
demonstrations.

a physical picture based on the Anderson localization to understand the

consistency between the experimental and numerical results confirms that the
bulk states are localized in the absence of a magnetic field and a QAH edge

Landau band formed with the localized bulk states, survives disorder, together
with the QAH edge state, leading to a $C=2$ phase. Eventually, we present a
phase diagram of a disordered $\mathrm{MnBi_2Te_4}$ which indicates more
coexistence states of QAH and QH to be verified by future experiments.

algorithm that does not know the distribution of its inputs approximates the
expected performance of the optimal algorithm for this distribution. This paper
gives a method that is agnostic to problem setting for proving lower bounds on
the prior independent approximation factor of any algorithm. The method
constructs a correlated distribution over inputs that can be generated both as
a distribution over i.i.d. good-for-algorithms distributions and as a
distribution over i.i.d. bad-for-algorithms distributions. Prior independent
algorithms are upper-bounded by the optimal algorithm for the latter
distribution even when the true distribution is the former. Thus, the ratio of
the expected performances of the Bayesian optimal algorithms for these two
decompositions is a lower bound on the prior independent approximation ratio.
The techniques of the paper connect prior independent algorithm design, Yao's
Minimax Principle, and information design. We apply this framework to give new
lower bounds on several canonical prior independent mechanism design problems.

one and two parameter exponential and Weibull models for $\mathcal{P}(t)$, each

diffusivity, geometry and boundary conditions. The developed models, despite
their simplicity, agree very well with values of $\mathcal{P}(t)$ obtained from
stochastic model simulations and continuum model solutions.

named Invariant-set theory, appears to bring ideas from several diverse fields
like chaos theory, number theory and dynamical systems to quantum foundations.
However, a clear cut hidden-variable model has not been developed, which makes
it difficult to assess the proposal from a quantum foundational perspective. In
this article, we first build a hidden-variable model based on the proposal, and
then critically analyse several aspects of the proposal using the model. We
show that several arguments related to counter-factual measurements,
nonlocality, non-commutativity of quantum observables, measurement independence
etcetera that appear to work in the proposal fail when considered in our model.
We further show that our model is not only superdeterministic but also
nonlocal, with an ontic quantum state. We argue that the bit string defined in
the model is a hidden variable and that it contains redundant information.
Lastly, we apply the analysis developed in a previous work (Proc. R. Soc. A,
476(2243):20200214, 2020) to illustrate the issue of superdeterministic
conspiracy in the model. Our results lend further support to the view that
superdeterminism is unlikely to solve the puzzle posed by the Bell
correlations.

atomistic simulations and continuum disclination dipole model, we show that,
depending on the tilt angle and 5|7 dislocation arrangement, MoS2 GB strength
can be enhanced or reduced with tilt angle. For zigzag-tilt GBs primarily
composed of Mo5|7+S5|7 dislocations, GB strength monotonically increases as the
square of tilt angle. For armchair-tilt GBs with Mo5|7 or S5|7 dislocations,
however, the trend of GB strength breaks down as 5|7 dislocations are
non-evenly spaced. Moreover, mechanical failure initiates at the bond shared by
5|7 rings, in contrast to graphene where failure occurs at the bond shared by
6|7 rings. This work provides new insights into mechanical design of synthetic

vehicle for disruptive scientific and technological progress. Pursuing the
vision articulated by Feynman, a concerted effort across many areas of research
and development is introducing prototypical digital quantum devices into the
computing ecosystem available to domain scientists. Through interactions with
these early quantum devices, the abstract vision of exploring
classically-intractable quantum systems is evolving toward becoming a tangible
reality. Beyond catalyzing these technological advances, entanglement is
enabling parallel progress as a diagnostic for quantum correlations and as an
organizational tool, both guiding improved understanding of quantum many-body
systems and quantum field theories defining and emerging from the Standard
Model. From the perspective of three domain science theorists, this article
compiles thoughts about the interface on entanglement, complexity, and quantum
simulation in an effort to contextualize recent NISQ-era progress with the
scientific objectives of nuclear and high-energy physics.

  Localization Harnessing Dynamic Blockage Events","Submitted to IEEE Internet of Things journal",,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper demonstrates the feasibility of single-antenna and single-RF
(radio frequency)- anchor received power strength indicator (RSSI) localization
(SARR-LOC) with the assistance of the computer vision (CV) technique.
Generally, to perform radio frequency (RF)-based device localization, either 1)
fine-grained channel state information or 2) RSSIs from multiple antenna
elements or multiple RF anchors (e.g., access points) is required. Meanwhile,
owing to deficiency of single-antenna and single-anchor RSSI, which only
indicates a coarse-grained distance information between a receiver and a
transmitter, realizing localization with single-antenna and single-anchor RSSI
is challenging. Our key idea to address this challenge is to leverage CV
technique and to estimate the most likely first Fresnel zone (FFZ) between the
receiver and transmitter, where the role of the RSSI is to detect blockage
timings. Specifically, historical positions of an obstacle that dynamically
blocks the FFZ are detected by the CV technique, and we estimate positions at
which a blockage starts and ends via a time series of RSSI. These estimated
obstacle positions, in principle, coincide with points on the FFZ boundaries,
enabling the estimation of the FFZ and localization of the transmitter. The
experimental evaluation revealed that the proposed SARR-LOC achieved the
localization error less than 1.0 m in an indoor environment, which is
comparable to that of a conventional triangulation-based RSSI localization with
multiple RF anchors.

environments is requiring that the agent can robustly return to learned safe

approach has been successful in low-dimensions, enforcing this constraint in
environments with visual observations is exceedingly challenging. We present a
novel continuous representation for safe sets by framing it as a binary
classification problem in a learned latent space, which flexibly scales to
image observations. We then present a new algorithm, Latent Space Safe Sets
(LS3), which uses this representation for long-horizon tasks with sparse

pressure. This new phase belongs to a trigonal $R\bar{3}m$ crystal lattice with
an atypical cell angle, $\alpha_{rhom}$ $\sim$ 24.56$^{\circ}$. We find that
the new structure contains three units of LaH$_{10}$ in its primitive cell,
unlike the previously known trigonal phase, where primitive cell contains only
one LaH$_{10}$ unit. In this phase, a 32-H atoms cage encapsulates La atoms,
analogous to the lower pressure face centred cubic phase. However, the hydrogen
cages of the trigonal phase consist of quadrilaterals and hexagons, in contrast
to the cubic phase, that exhibits squares and regular hexagons. Surprisingly,
the shortest H-H distance in the new phase is shorter than that of the lower
pressure cubic phase and of atomic hydrogen metal. We find a structural phase
transition from trigonal to hexagonal at 425 GPa, where the hexagonal crystal
lattice coincides with earlier predictions. Solving the anisotropic
Migdal-Eliashberg equations we obtain that the predicted trigonal phase (for
standard values of the Coulomb pseudopotential) is expected to become
superconducting at a critical temperature of about 175 K, which is less than
$T_c \sim$250 K measured for cubic LaH$_{10}$.

regularity of the DG model for general smooth initial data, which is a

a one-point blowup criterion and proving global well-posedness for initial data

generally improved either by increasing the number of training points or by
improving the models. In order to build accurate models based on expensive
high-level ab initio calculations, much of recent work has focused on the
latter. In particular, it has been shown that gradient domain machine learning
(GDML) models produce accurate results for high-dimensional molecular systems
with a small number of ab initio calculations. The present work extends GDML to
models with composite kernels built to maximize inference from a small number
of molecular geometries. We illustrate that GDML models can be improved by
increasing the complexity of underlying kernels through a greedy search
algorithm using Bayesian information criterion as the model selection metric.
We show that this requires including anisotropy into kernel functions and
produces models with significantly smaller generalization errors. The results
are presented for ethanol, uracil, malonaldehyde and aspirin. For aspirin, the
model with composite kernels trained by forces at 1000 randomly sampled

learning concept hierarchies from corpora encompasses a set of steps: parsing
the text into sentences, splitting the sentences and then tokenising it. After
the lemmatisation step, the pairs are extracted using FCA. However, there might
be some uninteresting and erroneous pairs in the formal context. Generating
formal context may lead to a time-consuming process, so formal context size
reduction is required to remove uninterested and erroneous pairs, taking less
time to extract the concept lattice and concept hierarchies accordingly. In
this premise, this study aims to propose two frameworks: (1) A framework to
review the current process of deriving concept hierarchies from corpus
utilising FCA; (2) A framework to decrease the formal contexts ambiguity of the
first framework using an adaptive version of ECA*. Experiments are conducted by
applying 385 sample corpora from Wikipedia on the two frameworks to examine the
reducing size of formal context, which leads to yield concept lattice and
concept hierarchy. The resulting lattice of formal context is evaluated to the
standard one using concept lattice-invariants. Accordingly, the homomorphic
between the two lattices preserves the quality of resulting concept hierarchies
by 89% in contrast to the basic ones, and the reduced concept lattice inherits
the structural relation of the standard one. The adaptive ECA* is examined
against its four counterpart baseline algorithms to measure the execution time

that adaptive ECA* performs concept lattice faster than other mentioned
competitive techniques in different fill ratios.

$(M_{\mathrm{B}})$ of SNe along with its correlation with spatial curvature
($\Omega_{k0}$) and cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) parameter
($\eta(z)$). This work is divided into two parts. Firstly, we check the
validity of CDDR which relates the luminosity distance ($d_L$) and angular
diameter distance ($d_A$) via redshift. We use the Pantheon SNe Ia dataset
combined with the $H(z)$ measurements derived from the cosmic chronometers.
Further, four different redshift-dependent parametrizations of the distance
duality parameter $(\eta(z))$ are used. The CDDR is fairly consistent for
almost every parametrization within a $2\sigma$ confidence level in both flat
and a non-flat universe. In the second part, we assume the validity of CDDR and
emphasize on the variability of $M_{\mathrm{B}}$ and its correlation with
$\Omega_{k0}$. We choose four different redshift-dependent parametrizations of
$M_{\mathrm{B}}$. The results indicate no evolution of $M_{\mathrm{B}}$ within
$2\sigma$ confidence level. For all parametrizations, the best fit value of
$\Omega_{k0}$ indicates a flat universe at $2\sigma$ confidence level. However

approximately sparse signal from the magnitude of its measurements. However, it
does not take advantage of any support information of the original signal.
Therefore, our main contribution in this paper is to extend the theoretical
framework for phaseless compressed sensing to incorporate with prior knowledge
of the support structure of the signal. Specifically, we investigate two
conditions that guarantee stable recovery of a weighted $k$-sparse signal via
weighted l1 minimization without any phase information. We first prove that the
weighted null space property (WNSP) is a sufficient and necessary condition for
the success of weighted l1 minimization for weighted k-sparse phase
retrievable. Moreover, we show that if a measurement matrix satisfies the
strong weighted restricted isometry property (SWRIP), then the original signal
can be stably recovered from the phaseless measurements.

of the corner states toward the end of the edge gap by adding an on-site
potential to the corner site, the penetration depth along the edge diverges
toward infinity while the penetration depth into the bulk remaining finite. We
analytically derive the corner-state wavefunction in a form of elliptic
integrals, which reproduces this anisotropic behavior of corner states. This
means that corner states have two kinds of penetration depths, and they behave
differently. At last, we show that hybridizations between corner states are
governed by the penetration depth through interference between the corner
states. It is because the corner states almost do not interfere with edge
states or bulk states.

to be underestimated up to several times. These findings show that the widely

the framework here is transferable to other nucleation systems, potentially

experience severe performance drop on unseen test images, due to various domain
discrepancy between the training images (source domain) and the test images
(target domain), which raises a domain adaptation issue. In clinical settings,
it is difficult to collect enough annotated target domain data in a short
period. Few-shot domain adaptation, i.e., adapting a trained model with a
handful of annotations, is highly practical and useful in this case. In this
paper, we propose a Polymorphic Transformer (Polyformer), which can be
incorporated into any DNN backbones for few-shot domain adaptation.
Specifically, after the polyformer layer is inserted into a model trained on
the source domain, it extracts a set of prototype embeddings, which can be
viewed as a ""basis"" of the source-domain features. On the target domain, the
polyformer layer adapts by only updating a projection layer which controls the
interactions between image features and the prototype embeddings. All other
model weights (except BatchNorm parameters) are frozen during adaptation. Thus,
the chance of overfitting the annotations is greatly reduced, and the model can
perform robustly on the target domain after being trained on a few annotated
images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Polyformer on two medical
segmentation tasks (i.e., optic disc/cup segmentation, and polyp segmentation).

disentangling the distinct visual attributes from audio signals. In this
article, we propose a light-weight, cross-modal distillation method to extract
disentangled emotional and identity information from unlabelled video inputs.
The extracted features are then integrated by a generative adversarial network
into talking face video clips. With carefully crafted discriminators, the
proposed framework achieves realistic generation results. Experiments with
observed individuals demonstrated that the proposed framework captures the
emotional expressions solely from speeches, and produces spontaneous facial
motion in the video output. Compared to the baseline method where speeches are
combined with a static image of the speaker, the results of the proposed
framework is almost indistinguishable. User studies also show that the proposed

surgery systems, in which the goal is to predict what phase is occurring at
each frame for a surgery video. Networks with multi-stage architecture have
been widely applied in many computer vision tasks with rich patterns, where a
predictor stage first outputs initial predictions and an additional refinement
stage operates on the initial predictions to perform further refinement.
Existing works show that surgical video contents are well ordered and contain
rich temporal patterns, making the multi-stage architecture well suited for the
surgical phase recognition task. However, we observe that when simply applying
the multi-stage architecture to the surgical phase recognition task, the
end-to-end training manner will make the refinement ability fall short of its
wishes. To address the problem, we propose a new non end-to-end training
strategy and explore different designs of multi-stage architecture for surgical
phase recognition task. For the non end-to-end training strategy, the
refinement stage is trained separately with proposed two types of disturbed
sequences. Meanwhile, we evaluate three different choices of refinement models
to show that our analysis and solution are robust to the choices of specific
multi-stage models. We conduct experiments on two public benchmarks, the
M2CAI16 Workflow Challenge, and the Cholec80 dataset. Results show that
multi-stage architecture trained with our strategy largely boosts the

decays are loop-suppressed in the SM and are thus very susceptible to
contributions from new heavy particles and/or new interactions beyond the SM.
  In rare semileptonic decays tensions are observed in measurements of

identify the most sensitive parameters out of 24 tunable parameters
corresponding to seven parameterization schemes of the WRF model. Ten tropical
cyclones across different categories, such as cyclonic storms, severe cyclonic
storms, and very severe cyclonic storms over BoB between 2011 and 2018, are
selected in this study. The sensitivity scores of 24 parameters are evaluated
for eight meteorological variables. The parameter sensitivity results are
consistent across three SA methods for all the variables, and 8 out of the 24
parameters contribute 80%-90% to the overall sensitivity scores. It is found
that the Sobol' method with Gaussian progress regression as a surrogate model
can produce reliable sensitivity results when the available samples exceed 200.
The parameters with which the model simulations have the least RMSE values when

Comparing observations and model simulations with the default and optimal

depth and robustness. For this purpose, we selectively retrain different
portions of VGG and ResNet architectures on CIFAR-10, Imagenette, and ImageNet
using non-adversarial and adversarial data. Experimental results show that
susceptibility to adversarial samples is associated with low-level feature
extraction layers. Therefore, retraining of high-level layers is insufficient
for achieving robustness. Furthermore, adversarial attacks yield outputs from
early layers that differ statistically from features for non-adversarial
samples and do not permit consistent classification by subsequent layers. This
supports common hypotheses regarding the association of robustness with the
feature extractor, insufficiency of deeper layers in providing robustness, and
large differences in adversarial and non-adversarial feature vectors.

considers a synchronization-free approach to timestamping LoRaWAN uplink data
based on signal arrival time at the gateway, which well matches LoRaWAN's
one-hop star topology and releases bandwidth from transmitting timestamps and
synchronizing end devices' clocks at all times. However, we show that this
approach is susceptible to a {\em frame delay attack} consisting of malicious
frame collision and delayed replay. Real experiments show that the attack can
affect the end devices in large areas up to about $50,000\,\text{m}^2$. In a
broader sense, the attack threatens any system functions requiring timely
deliveries of LoRaWAN frames. To address this threat, we propose a
$\mathsf{LoRaTS}$ gateway design that integrates a commodity LoRaWAN gateway

biases of the end devices. Based on an analytic model of LoRa's chirp spread

frequency biases with high accuracy beyond that achieved by LoRa's default

detection of the attack that introduces additional frequency biases. We also

that induce connected subgraphs. Such partitions naturally occur in many
application areas such as road networks, and image processing. We consider
Balanced Connected Partitions (BCP), where the two classical objectives for BCP
are to maximize the weight of the smallest, or minimize the weight of the
largest component. We study BCP on c-claw-free graphs, the class of graphs that
do not have $K_{1,c}$ as an induced subgraph, and present efficient
(c-1)-approximation algorithms for both objectives. In particular, due to the
(3-)claw-freeness of line graphs, this also implies a 2-approximations for the
edge-partition version of BCP in general graphs.
  In the 1970s Gy\H{o}ri and Lov\'{a}sz showed for natural numbers
$w_1,\dots,w_k$ where $\sum_i w_i$ is the vertex size, that if $G$ is
k-connected, then there exist a connected k-partition with part sizes
$w_1,\dots,w_k$. However, to this day no polynomial algorithm to compute such
partitions exists for k>4. Towards finding such a partition $T_1,\dots, T_k$,
we show how to efficiently compute connected partitions that at least
approximately meet the target weights, subject to the mild assumption that each
$w_i$ is greater than the weight of the heaviest vertex. In particular, we give
a 3-approximation for both the lower and the upper bounded version i.e. we
guarantee that each $T_i$ has weight at least $\frac{w_i}{3}$ or that each
$T_i$ has weight most $3w_i$, respectively. Also, we present a both-side
bounded version that produces a connected partition where each $T_i$ has size
at least $\frac{w_i}{3}$ and at most $\max(\{r,3\}) w_i$, where $r \geq 1$ is
the ratio between the largest and smallest value in $w_1, \dots, w_k$. In
particular for the balanced version, i.e.~$w_1=w_2=, \dots,=w_k$, this gives a
partition with $\frac{1}{3}w_i \leq w(T_i) \leq 3w_i$.

individualized regime that determines the best treatment initiation time for

residual lifetime as a value function to evaluate the performance of different
treatment initiation regimes, and develop a nonparametric estimator for the
value function, which is consistent even when treatment initiation times are
not completely observable and their distribution is unknown. We also establish
the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimator in the decision rule and
its associated value function estimator. In particular, the asymptotic
distribution of the estimated value function is nonstandard, which follows a
weighted chi-squared distribution. The finite-sample performance of the
proposed method is evaluated by simulation studies and is further illustrated

efficiency and treatment outcome. We aim to develop a novel hybrid deep
learning approach, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the
self-attention mechanism, for rapid and accurate multi-organ segmentation on
head and neck computed tomography (CT) images. Head and neck CT images with
manual contours of 115 patients were retrospectively collected and used. We set
the training/validation/testing ratio to 81/9/25 and used the 10-fold
cross-validation strategy to select the best model parameters. The proposed
hybrid model segmented ten organs-at-risk (OARs) altogether for each case. The
performance of the model was evaluated by three metrics, i.e., the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance 95% (HD95), and mean surface
distance (MSD). We also tested the performance of the model on the Head and
Neck 2015 challenge dataset and compared it against several state-of-the-art
automated segmentation algorithms. The proposed method generated contours that
closely resemble the ground truth for ten OARs. Our results of the new Weaving
Attention U-net demonstrate superior or similar performance on the segmentation
of head and neck CT images.

properties of a spacetime. As a new type of the strong gravity system, boson
stars could mimic black holes located at the center of galaxies. Studying the
motion of a test particle in the spacetime of a rotating boson star will
provide the astrophysical observable effects if a boson star is located at the
center of a galaxy. In this paper, we investigate the timelike geodesic of a
test particle in the background of a rotating boson star with angular number
$m=(1, 2, 3)$. With the change of angular number and frequency, a rotating
boson star will transform from the low rotating state to the highly
relativistic rapidly rotating state, the corresponding Lense-Thirring effects
will be more and more significant and it should be studied in detail. By
solving the four-velocity of a test particle and integrating the geodesics, we
investigate the bound orbits with a zero and nonzero angular momentum. We find
that a test particle can stay more longer time in the central region of a boson
star when the boson star becomes from low rotating state to highly relativistic
rotating state. Comparing the periapse values of the orbits obtained in
rotating boson stars and the corresponding orbits of the observed stars
orbiting Sagittarius $A^*$, we discuss the possible observable effects of the
astrophysical boson star in the Galactic center.

  Inductive Families",,,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Harnessing the power of dependently typed languages can be difficult.
Programmers must manually construct proofs to produce well-typed programs,
which is not an easy task. In particular, migrating code to these languages is
challenging. Gradual typing can make dependently-typed languages easier to use
by mixing static and dynamic checking in a principled way. With gradual types,
programmers can incrementally migrate code to a dependently typed language.
  However, adding gradual types to dependent types creates a new challenge:
mixing decidable type-checking and incremental migration in a full-featured
language is a precarious balance. Programmers expect type-checking to
terminate, but dependent type-checkers evaluate terms at compile time, which is
problematic because gradual types can introduce non-termination into an
otherwise terminating language. Steps taken to mitigate this non-termination
must not jeopardize the smooth transitions between dynamic and static.
  We present a gradual dependently-typed language that supports inductive type
families, has decidable type-checking, and provably supports smooth migration
between static and dynamic, as codified by the refined criteria for gradual
typing proposed by Siek et al. (2015). Like Eremondi et al. (2019), we use
approximate normalization for terminating compile-time evaluation. Unlike
Eremondi et al., our normalization does not require comparison of variables,
allowing us to show termination with a syntactic model that accommodates
inductive types. Moreover, we design a novel a technique for tracking
constraints on type indices, so that dynamic constraint violations signal
run-time errors eagerly. To facilitate these checks, we define an algebraic
notion of gradual precision, axiomatizing certain semantic properties of
gradual terms.

responds. We investigate the detector's response which contains non-Markovian
information about the quantum field squeezed by the dynamical spacetime. The
challenge is in the memory effects accumulated over the evolutionary history.
We first consider a detector $W$, the `\textsl{Witness}', which co-existed and
evolved with the quantum field from the beginning. We derive a nonMarkovian
quantum Langevin equation for the detector's $Q$ by integrating over the
squeezed quantum field. The solution of this integro-differential equation
would answer our question, in principle, but very challenging, in practice.
Striking a compromise, we then ask, to what extent can a detector $D$
introduced at late times, called the `\textsl{Detective}', decipher past
memories. This situation corresponds to many cosmological experiments today
probing specific stages in the past, such as COBE targeting activities at the
surface of last scattering. Somewhat surprisingly we show that it is possible
to retrieve to some degree certain global physical quantities, such as the
resultant squeezing, particles created, quantum coherence and correlations. The
reason is because the quantum field has all the fine-grained information from
the beginning in how it was driven by the cosmic dynamics $a(t)$. How long the
details of past history can persist in the quantum field depends on the memory
time. The fact that a squeezed field cannot come to complete equilibrium under
constant driving, as in an evolving spacetime, actually helps to retain the
memory. We discuss interesting features and potentials of this
`\textit{archaeological}' perspective toward cosmological issues.

advantage of the fact that similar patches tend to have similar sparse

to strike a balance between image detail preservation and noise removal. Our
extensive experiments showed that our proposed CoFiB algorithm does not only

different attention weights to each node with the self-attention mechanism.

human levels of intelligence in many respects, yet unlike humans, their ability
to learn new tasks quickly remains a challenge. People can reason not only in
familiar domains, but can also rapidly learn to reason through novel problems
and situations, raising the question of how well modern neural network models
capture human intelligence and in which ways they diverge. In this work, we
explore this gap by investigating human adults' ability to learn an abstract
reasoning task based on Sudoku from a brief instructional tutorial with
explanatory feedback for incorrect responses using a narrow range of training
examples. We find that participants who master the task do so within a small
number of trials and generalize well to puzzles outside of the training range.
We also find that most of those who master the task can describe a valid
solution strategy, and such participants perform better on transfer puzzles
than those whose strategy descriptions are vague or incomplete. Interestingly,
fewer than half of our human participants were successful in acquiring a valid
solution strategy, and this ability is associated with high school mathematics
education. We consider the challenges these findings pose for building
computational models that capture all aspects of our findings and point toward
a possible role for learning to engage in explanation-based reasoning to
support rapid learning and generalization.

framework contains three parts: an Encoder which is used to extract latent

to the latent features, and a Discriminator minimizes the distance of latent
features of measured and simulated data. We demonstrate the FMNet with six
activities data and two experimental scenarios, and final results show strong
enhanced patterns and can keep actual motion information to the greatest
extent. On the other hand, we also propose a novel idea which trains a
classifier with only simulated data and predicts new measured samples after
cleaning them up with the FMNet. From final classification results, we can see
significant improvements.

size. If we do so, we find that: 1.- Even without any free constant for dark
energy, the evolution of the Hubble parameter is exactly the same as for the
LCDM model, so we expect this model to have the same predictions as LCDM. 2.-
The density rate of the dark energy is $\Omega_{\Lambda}= 0.69$ which is a very
similar value as the one found by the Planck satellite $\Omega_{\Lambda}=
0.684$. 3.- The dark energy has this value because it corresponds to the actual
size of the radius of the Universe, thus the coincidence problem has a very
natural explanation. 4.-It is possible to find also a natural explanation to
why observations inferred from the local distance ladder find the value $H_0=
73$ km/s/Mpc for the Hubble constant. We show that if we take the variability
of the dark energy into account, they should measure $H_0= 67.3$ km/s/Mpc as
well. 5.-In this model the inflationary period contains a natural successful

efforts in this research direction. In the current work, we performed a case
study using meta-learning to choose the number of hidden nodes for MLP
networks, which is an important parameter to be defined aiming a good networks
performance. In our work, we generated a base of meta-examples associated to 93
regression problems. Each meta-example was generated from a regression problem
and stored: 16 features describing the problem (e.g., number of attributes and
correlation among the problem attributes) and the best number of nodes for this
problem, empirically chosen from a range of possible values. This set of
meta-examples was given as input to a meta-learner which was able to predict
the best number of nodes for new problems based on their features. The
experiments performed in this case study revealed satisfactory results.
