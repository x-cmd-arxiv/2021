frequency, based on Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH), and of the seed-pump relative

the necessity of two different modulation and demodulation stages. We also
analyze the effect of the pump in the cavity stabilization for different
seed-pump relative phase configurations, resulting in an offset in the PDH
error signal, which has to be compensated. Finally, an application of our

(SINDy) framework, in which target ODE models are expressed as a sparse linear
combinations of pre-specified candidate functions. Promoting parsimony through
sparsity in SINDy leads to interpretable models that generalize to unknown
data. Instead of targeting point estimates of the SINDy (linear combination)
coefficients, in this work we estimate these coefficients via sparse Bayesian
inference. The resulting method, uncertainty quantification SINDy (UQ-SINDy),
quantifies not only the uncertainty in the values of the SINDy coefficients due
to observation errors and limited data, but also the probability of inclusion
of each candidate function in the linear combination. UQ-SINDy promotes
robustness against observation noise and limited data, interpretability (in
terms of model selection and inclusion probabilities), and generalization
capacity for out-of-sample forecast. Sparse inference for UQ-SINDy employs
Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and we explore two sparsifying priors: the
spike-and-slab prior, and the regularized horseshoe prior. We apply UQ-SINDy to
synthetic nonlinear data sets from a Lotka-Volterra model and a nonlinear
oscillator, and to a real-world data set of lynx and hare populations. We find
that UQ-SINDy is able to discover accurate and meaningful models even in the

qualitatively that SGG models with DLFE produce prominently more balanced and

larger $E$ have less diversity in bond angles and thus simpler neighborhoods.
We show that $E$ possesses a number of intuitive mathematical properties, such

distinguish a wide range of structures and conjecture that it is maximized by
the icosahedral geometry under the constraint of equal sphere packing. An
algorithm for computing $E$ is described and is applied to the structural
characterization of crystals and glasses. The findings of this study are
generally consistent with existing knowledge on the structure of such systems.
We compare $E$ to the Steinhardt order parameter $Q_6$ and polyhedral template
matching (PTM). We observe that $E$ has resolution comparable to $Q_6$ and
robustness similar to PTM despite being much simpler than the former and far
more informative than the latter.

molecular dynamics, as well as one-atom DFT as implemented in the neutral
pseudo-atom method where multi-atom effects are treated by ion-ion correlation
functionals. Both methods use electron-electron exchange correlation

that liquid carbon displays multiple liquid-liquid transitions linked to

for stellarators due to the difficulties in fabricating non-planar coils. The
FOCUS code removes the need for a winding surface and represents the coils as
arbitrary curves in 3D. In the following work, the implementation of a spline
representation for the coils in FOCUS is described, along with the
implementation of a new engineering constraint to design coils with a
straighter outer section. The new capabilities of the code are shown as an
example on HSX, NCSX, and a prototype quasi-axisymmetric reactor-sized
stellarator. The flexibility granted by splines along with the new constraint
will allow for stellarator coil designs with improved accessibility and
simplified maintenance

geometric nonlinearity dramatically reduces dissipation. This phenomenon,
dissipation dilution, is employed in mirror suspensions of gravitational wave
interferometers and at the nanoscale, where soft-clamping and strain
engineering have allowed extremely high quality factors. However, these
techniques have so far only been applied in amorphous materials, specifically
silicon nitride. Crystalline materials exhibit significantly lower intrinsic
damping at cryogenic temperatures, due to the absence of two level systems in
the bulk, as exploited in Weber bars and silicon optomechanical cavities.
Applying dissipation dilution engineering to strained crystalline materials
could therefore enable extremely low loss nanomechanical resonators, due to the
combination of reduced internal friction, high intrinsic strain, and high yield
strength. Pioneering work has not yet fully exploited this potential. Here, we
demonstrate that single crystal strained silicon, a material developed for high
mobility transistors, can be used to realize mechanical resonators with
ultralow dissipation. We observe that high aspect ratio ($>10^5$) strained
silicon nanostrings support MHz mechanical modes with quality factors exceeding
$10^{10}$ at 7 K, a tenfold improvement over values reported in silicon
nitride. At 7 K, the thermal noise-limited force sensitivity is approximately
$45\ \mathrm{{zN}/{\sqrt{Hz}}}$ - approaching that of carbon nanotubes - and
the heating rate is only 60 quanta-per-second. Our nanomechanical resonators
exhibit lower dissipation than the most pristine macroscopic oscillators and
their low mass makes them particularly promising for quantum sensing and
transduction.

they are expected to also contain a substantial population of off-center
""wandering"" SMBHs naturally produced by the hierarchical merger-driven process
of galaxy assembly. This population has been recently characterized in an
analysis of the Romulus cosmological simulations, which correct for the
dynamical forces on SMBHs without artificially pinning them to halo centers.
Here we predict an array of electromagnetic signatures for these wanderers. The
predicted wandering population of SMBHs from Romulus broadly reproduces the
observed spatial offsets of a recent sample of hyperluminous X-ray sources. We
predict that the sources with the most extreme offsets are likely to arise from
SMBHs within satellite galaxies. These simulations also predict a significant
population of secondary active galactic nuclei (AGN) with luminosities at least
10\% that of the central AGN. The majority of galaxies at $z=4$ that host a
central AGN with bolometric luminosity $L_\mathrm{bol}>10^{42} \ \mathrm{erg}
\; \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ are predicted to host a companion off-center AGN of
comparable brightness. We demonstrate that stacked X-ray observations of
similar mass galaxies may reveal a halo of collective emission attributable to
these wanderers. Finally, because wanderers dominate the population of SMBHs
with masses of $\lesssim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ in Romulus, they may dominate tidal
disruption event (TDE) rates at these masses if they retain a stellar component
(e.g. a nuclear star cluster). This could warrant an order of magnitude
correction to current theoretically estimated TDE rates at low SMBH masses.

Depending on the tagging efficiency of the final state $b$-jet, the measurement
of $A_e^b$ at HERA can already partially break the degeneracy found in the

electroweak data. In the first year run of the EIC, the measurement of $A_e^b$

small Fabry-Perot interferometer in which these electrostatic coupling
constants can be determined experimentally, facilitating quantitative
comparison with theory. At the $\nu = 1/3$ fractional quantum Hall state, this
device exhibits Aharonov-Bohm interference near the center of the conductance
plateau interrupted by a few discrete phase jumps, and $\Phi_0$ oscillations at
higher and lower magnetic fields, consistent with theoretical predictions for
detection of anyonic statistics. We estimate the electrostatic parameters $K_I$

compressible versus incompressible regions, and from finite-bias conductance
measurements, and these two methods yield consistent results. We find that the

this problem, the goal is to select a small subset of features, combine them to
form a new feature (called the crossed feature) by considering their Cartesian
product, and find feature crosses to learn an \emph{accurate} model. In
particular, we study the problem of maximizing a normalized Area Under the
Curve (AUC) of the linear model trained on the crossed feature column.
  First, we show that it is not possible to provide an $n^{1/\log\log

hypothesis fails. This result also rules out the possibility of solving this
problem in polynomial time unless $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$. On the positive
side, by assuming the \naive\ assumption, we show that there exists a simple
greedy $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for this problem. This result is
established by relating the AUC to the total variation of the commutator of two
probability measures and showing that the total variation of the commutator is
monotone and submodular. To show this, we relate the submodularity of this
function to the positive semi-definiteness of a corresponding kernel matrix.
Then, we use Bochner's theorem to prove the positive semi-definiteness by
showing that its inverse Fourier transform is non-negative everywhere. Our
techniques and structural results might be of independent interest.

relations, finding that low-mass compact galaxies tend to be overmassive in the
BH mass-stellar mass plane but not as much in the BH mass-stellar velocity
dispersion correlation. This, together with available BH mass measurements for
some of the low-mass compact galaxies, supports a stripping origin for the
majority of these objects that would contribute to the scatter seen at the
low-mass end of the BH-galaxy scaling relations. However, the differences are
too large to be explained solely by this scatter, and thus our results suggest
that a flattening at such low-masses is also plausible, happening at a velocity
dispersion of ~20-40 km/s.

single descriptor for each channel. Here, we empirically analyze the amount of
spatial context needed for effective channel attention and find that limited
localcontext on the order of seven rows or columns of the original image is
sufficient to match the performance of global context. We propose tiled
squeeze-and-excite (TSE), which is a framework for building SE-like blocks that
employ several descriptors per channel, with each descriptor based on local
context only. We further show that TSE is a drop-in replacement for the SE
block and can be used in existing SE networks without re-training. This implies
that local context descriptors are similar both to each other and to the global
context descriptor. Finally, we show that TSE has important practical
implications for deployment of SE-networks to dataflow AI accelerators due to
their reduced pipeline buffering requirements. For example, using TSE reduces
the amount of activation pipeline buffering in EfficientDetD2 by 90% compared
to SE (from 50M to 4.77M) without loss of accuracy. Our code and pre-trained

magnetic field. In this study, we aim to ascertain the accuracy of the magnetic
field determined from inversions of the Ca II 8542 \AA\ line. We have developed
numerical simulations of wave propagation in a sunspot umbra. Synthetic Stokes
profiles emerging from the simulated atmosphere were computed and then inverted
using the NICOLE code. The atmospheres inferred from the inversions have been
compared with the original parameters from the simulations. Our results show
that the inferred chromospheric fluctuations in velocity and temperature match
the known oscillations from the numerical simulation. In contrast, the vertical
magnetic field obtained from the inversions exhibits an oscillatory pattern
with a $\sim$300 G peak-to-peak amplitude which is absent in the simulation. We
have assessed the error in the inferred parameters by performing numerous
inversions with slightly different configurations of the same Stokes profiles.
We find that when the atmosphere is approximately at rest, the inversion tends
to favor solutions that underestimate the vertical magnetic field strength. On
the contrary, during umbral flashes, the values inferred from most of the
inversions are concentrated at stronger fields than those from the simulation.
Our analysis provides a quantification of the errors associated with the

particle-trapping phenomena. As a result of recent progress in laser
technology, high-power lasers provide a platform to create and probe such
fields in the laboratory. With new large-scale laser facilities on the horizon
and the prospect of investigating these hitherto unexplored regimes, we review

To answer the verifier's challenges, existing proofs of quantumness typically
require the quantum prover to perform a combination of polynomial-size quantum

constructions in which the prover need only perform constant-depth quantum

first construction is a generic compiler that allows us to translate all

architecture of interleaved non-overlapped window-based self-attention \&

various visual recognition tasks, and challenges the ubiquitous convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) using densely slid kernels. Most follow-up works attempt
to replace the shifted-window operation with other kinds of cross-window
communication paradigms, while treating self-attention as the de-facto standard
for window-based information aggregation. In this manuscript, we question
whether self-attention is the only choice for hierarchical Vision Transformer
to attain strong performance, and the effects of different kinds of
cross-window communication. To this end, we replace self-attention layers with
embarrassingly simple linear mapping layers, and the resulting proof-of-concept
architecture termed as LinMapper can achieve very strong performance in
ImageNet-1k image recognition. Moreover, we find that LinMapper is able to
better leverage the pre-trained representations from image recognition and
demonstrates excellent transfer learning properties on downstream dense

experiment with other alternatives to self-attention for content aggregation
inside each non-overlapped window under different cross-window communication
approaches, which all give similar competitive results. Our study reveals that
the \textbf{macro architecture} of Swin model families, other than specific
aggregation layers or specific means of cross-window communication, may be more
responsible for its strong performance and is the real challenger to the
ubiquitous CNN's dense sliding window paradigm. Code and models will be

factorization, and what the gravity dual of a single member of the ensemble is.
We find that as $\sigma^2$ is decreased, the JT gravity dilaton potential gets

by non-spherical dust grains in nearby galaxies. We determine the angular
resolution and sensitivity required to study the magnetic field configuration
in these galaxies. (Methods) We post-process a set of Milky Way like galaxies
from the Auriga project, assuming a dust mix consisting of spheroidal dust
grains that are partially aligned with the model magnetic field. We constrain
our dust model using Planck 353 GHz observations of the Milky Way. This model
is then extrapolated to shorter wavelengths that cover the peak of interstellar
dust emission and to observations of arbitrarily oriented nearby Milky Way like
galaxies. (Results) Assuming an intrinsic linear polarisation fraction that
does not vary significantly with wavelength for wavelengths longer than 50
micron, we predict a linear polarisation fraction with a maximum of $10-15\%$
and a median value of $\approx{}7\%$ for face-on galaxies and $\approx{}3\%$
for edge-on galaxies. The polarisation fraction anti-correlates with the line
of sight density and with the angular dispersion function which expresses the
large scale order of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight. The
maximum linear polarisation fraction agrees well with the intrinsic properties
of the dust model. The true magnetic field orientation can be traced along low
density lines of sight when it is coherent along the line of sight. These
results also hold for nearby galaxies, where a coherent magnetic field
structure is recovered over a range of different broad bands. (Conclusions)
Polarised emission from non-spherical dust grains accurately traces the large
scale structure of the galactic magnetic field in Milky Way like galaxies, with
expected maximum linear polarisation fractions of $10-15\%$. To resolve this
maximum, a spatial resolution of at least 1 kpc is required.

metallicities of the SAM galaxies as inputs for the FSM20 model, and vary the
amount of non-thermal support. The density profiles in our models can be
approximated by power-law functions with slopes in the range of $0.75 < a_n <
1.25$, with higher non-thermal pressure resulting in flatter distributions. We
explore how the gas pressure, dispersion measure, OVI-OVIII column densities,
and cooling rates behave with the gas distribution and total mass. We show that
for CGM masses below $\sim 3 \times 10^{10}~{\rm M_{sun}}$, photoionization has
a significant effect on the column densities of OVI and OVIII. The combination
of different MW CGM observations favors models with similar fractions in
thermal pressure, magnetic fields/cosmic rays, and turbulent support, and with
$M_{\rm gas} \sim 3-10 \times 10^{10}~{\rm M_{sun}}$. The MW OVI column
requires $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm dyn} \sim 4$, independent of the gas
distribution. The AGN jet-driven heating rates in the SAM are enough to offset
the CGM cooling, although exact balance is not required in star-forming
galaxies. We provide predictions for the columns densities of additional metal
ions - NV, NeVIII, and MgX.

the effects of excess mixing in superadiabatic layers that are dominated by
radiation pressure, and we critically investigate the effects of mixing and
mass loss on the evolution of RSGs with log (Teff/K) < 3.68 - as a function of
metallicity. Using MESA, we produce grids of massive star models at three
metallicities: Galactic (Zsol), LMC (1/2 Zsol) and SMC (1/5 Zsol), with both
high and low amounts of overshooting to study the upper luminosity limit of
RSGs. We systematically study the effects of excess mixing in the
superadiabatic layers of post-main sequence massive stars, overshooting above
the hydrogen core and yellow supergiant (YSG) mass-loss rates on the fraction
of core helium burning time spent as a RSG. We find that the excess mixing in
the superadiabatic layers is stronger at lower metallicities, as it depends on
the opacities in the hydrogen bump at log (Teff/K) ~ 4, which become more
pronounced at lower metallicity. This shifts the cutoff luminosities to lower
values at lower metallicities, thus balancing the first-order effect of mass
loss. The opposing effects of mass loss and excess envelope mixing during
post-main sequence evolution of stars with higher overshooting potentially
results in a metallicity-independent upper luminosity limit.

ALPs would decay into electron-positron pairs, generating a positron flux. In

states following semiclassical skipping orbits with alternating electron-hole
nature. The spin-orbit induced splitting of the Fermi surface causes these
carriers to move along cyclotron orbits with different radii, allowing for
their spatial spin separation. When Andreev reflection takes place at the
superconducting lead, scattered carriers flip both their charge and spin,
generating distinguishable features in the transport properties of the device.
In particular, we report a notable enhancement of the separation between the
spin-split focal points, which scales linearly with the number of Andreev

derive constraints on the fraction of the dark matter that is in the form of
primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses in the range $10^{15}$-$10^{17}\,$g.
Improving upon previous analyses, we consider the effect of the X-ray heating
of the intergalactic medium on these constraints, and also use the full shape
of the 21-cm absorption feature in our inference. In order to account for the
anomalously deep absorption amplitude, we also consider an excess radio
background motivated by LWA1 and ARCADE2 observations. Because the heating rate
induced by PBH evaporation evolves slowly, the data favour a scenario in which
PBH-induced heating is accompanied by X-ray heating. Also, for the same reason,
using the full measurement across the EDGES observation band yields much
stronger constraints on PBHs than just the redshift of absorption. We find that
21-cm observations exclude $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \gtrsim 10^{-9.7}$ at 95% CL for
$M_{\mathrm{PBH}}=10^{15}\,$g. This limit weakens approximately as
$M_{\mathrm{PBH}}^4$ towards higher masses, thus providing the strongest
constraints on ultralight evaporating PBHs as dark matter over the entire mass
range $10^{15}$-$10^{17}\,$g. Under the assumption of a simple spherical
gravitational collapse based on the Press-Schechter formalism, we also derive

attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a
short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a

parameters is improved by including the magnitude gap ($\rm m_{gap}$) between
the BCG and fourth brightest cluster member (M14) as a third parameter in the
SMHM relation. At fixed halo mass, accounting for $\rm m_{gap}$, through a
stretch parameter, reduces the SMHM relation's intrinsic scatter. To explore
this redshift range, we use clusters, BCGs, and cluster members identified
using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey C4 and redMaPPer cluster catalogs and the
Dark Energy Survey redMaPPer catalog. Through this joint analysis, we detect no
systematic differences in BCG stellar mass, $\rm m_{gap}$, and cluster mass
(inferred from richness) between the datsets. We utilize the Pareto function to
quantify each parameter's evolution. We confirm prior findings of negative
evolution in the SMHM relation's slope (3.5$\sigma$) and detect negative
evolution in the stretch parameter (4.0$\sigma$) and positive evolution in the
offset parameter (5.8$\sigma$). This observed evolution, combined with the
absence of BCG growth, when stellar mass is measured within 50kpc, suggests
that this evolution results from changes in the cluster's $\rm m_{gap}$. For
this to occur, late-term growth must be in the intra-cluster light surrounding
the BCG. We also compare the observed results to Illustris TNG 300-1

Multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations of convection in stellar
interiors are numerically challenging, especially for flows at low Mach
numbers.
  Methods. We explore the benefits of using a low-Mach hydrodynamic flux solver
and demonstrate its usability for simulations in the astrophysical context. The
time-implicit Seven-League Hydro (SLH) code was used to perform
multidimensional simulations of convective helium shell burning based on a 25
M$_\odot$ star model. The results obtained with the low-Mach AUSM$^{+}$-up
solver were compared to results when using its non low-Mach variant
AUSM$_\mathrm{B}^{+}$-up. We applied well-balancing of the gravitational source
term to maintain the initial hydrostatic background stratification. The
computational grids have resolutions ranging from $180 \times 90^2$ to $810
\times 540^2$ cells and the nuclear energy release was boosted by factors of $3
\times 10^3$, $1 \times 10^4$, and $3 \times 10^4$ to study the dependence of
the results on these parameters.
  Results. The boosted energy input results in convection at Mach numbers in
the range of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$. Standard mixing-length theory (MLT)
predicts convective velocities of about $1.6 \times 10^{-4}$ if no boosting is
applied. Simulations with AUSM$^{+}$-up show a Kolmogorov-like inertial range
in the kinetic energy spectrum that extends further toward smaller scales
compared with its non low-Mach variant. The kinetic energy dissipation of the
AUSM$^{+}$-up solver already converges at a lower resolution compared to
AUSM$^{+}_{\mathrm{B}}$ -up. The extracted entrainment rates at the boundaries
of the convection zone are well represented by the bulk Richardson entrainment
law and the corresponding fitting parameters are in agreement with published
results for carbon shell burning.

uncertainty to the potential outcomes of software crowdsourcing. These factors
lead to the need for supporting CSD managers with automated scheduling to
improve the visibility and predictability of crowdsourcing processes and
outcomes. To that end, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm-based task
scheduling method for crowdsourced software development. The proposed
evolutionary scheduling method uses a multiobjective genetic algorithm to
recommend an optimal task start date. The method uses three fitness functions,
based on project duration, task similarity, and task failure prediction,
respectively. The task failure fitness function uses a neural network to
predict the probability of task failure with respect to a specific task start
date. The proposed method then recommends the best tasks start dates for the
project as a whole and each individual task so as to achieve the lowest project
failure ratio. Experimental results on 4 projects demonstrate that the proposed

strain and its time integrals after the passage of a burst of GWs. Their
presence is closely tied to symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes and
fluxes of conserved charges conjugate to these symmetries. While the
phenomenology of GW memory effects is well understood in general relativity
(GR), it is less well understood in the many modifications to GR. We recently
computed asymptotically flat solutions, symmetries, conserved quantities, and
GW memory effects in one such modified theory: Brans-Dicke theory. In this
paper, we apply our results from this earlier work to compute the GW memories
from compact binaries in the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation. In addition to
taking the PN limit of these effects, we work in the approximation that the
energy and angular momentum losses through scalar radiation are small compared
to the energy and angular momentum losses through (tensor) GWs. We focus on the
tensor (as opposed to scalar) GW memory effect, which we compute through
Newtonian order, and the small differences induced by scalar radiation at this
order. Specifically, we compute the nonlinear parts of the tensor displacement
and spin GW memory effects produced during the inspiral of quasicircular,
nonprecessing binaries in Brans-Dicke theory. Because the energy radiated
through the scalar dipole moment appears as a -1 PN order-effect, then in this
approximation, the displacement memory has a logarithmic dependence on the PN
parameter and the spin memory has a relative -1 PN-order correction; these
corrections are ultimately small because they are related to the total energy
and angular momentum radiated in the scalar field, respectively. At Newtonian
order, the scalar radiation also gives rise to a sky pattern of the memory
effect around an isolated source that differs from that of the memory effect in
GR.

computation in person re-identification (re-ID) and have achieved great
success. However, due to the non-overlapping between training and testing IDs,
the difference between the data used for model training and the testing data
makes the performance of learned feature degraded during testing. Hence,
re-ranking is proposed to mitigate this issue and various algorithms have been
developed. However, most of existing re-ranking methods focus on replacing the
Euclidean distance with sophisticated distance metrics, which are not friendly
to downstream tasks and hard to be used for fast retrieval of massive data in
real applications. In this work, we propose a graph-based re-ranking method to
improve learned features while still keeping Euclidean distance as the
similarity metric. Inspired by graph convolution networks, we develop an
operator to propagate features over an appropriate graph. Since graph is the
essential key for the propagation, two important criteria are considered for
designing the graph, and three different graphs are explored accordingly.
Furthermore, a simple yet effective method is proposed to generate a profile
vector for each tracklet in videos, which helps extend our method to video
re-ID. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets, e.g., Market-1501,
Duke, and MARS, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

limited knowledge about workers' preferences and performance. To develop better
understanding of worker reliability and trustworthiness in software
crowdsourcing, this paper reports an empirical study conducted on more than one
year's real-world data from TopCoder, one of the leading software crowdsourcing
platforms.
  To do so, first, we create a bipartite network of active workers based on
common task registrations. Then, we use the Clauset-Newman-Moore graph
clustering algorithm to identify worker clusters in the network. Finally, we
conduct an empirical evaluation to measure and analyze workers' behavior per
identified community in the platform by workers' rating. More specifically,
workers' behavior is analyzed based on their performances in terms of
reliability, trustworthiness, and success; their preferences in terms of
efficiency and elasticity; and strategies in terms of comfort, confidence, and
deceitfulness. The main result of this study identified four communities of
active workers: mixed-ranked, high-ranked, mid-ranked, and low-ranked. This
study shows that the low-ranked community associates with the highest reliable
workers with an average reliability of 25%, while the mixed-ranked community
contains the most trustworthy workers with average trustworthiness of 16%. Such
empirical evidence is beneficial to help exploring resourcing options while
understanding the relations among unknown resources to improve task success.

present at small sizes. Further, this chapter compares the extant properties of
the satellites of trans-Neptunian dwarf planets and their implications for the

mock data of two large-scale counter-rotating stellar disks as if they were

different photometric, kinematic, and stellar population properties of the two
counter-rotating components as a function of galaxy inclination. We extracted
the stellar kinematics in the wavelength region of the calcium triplet
absorption lines by adopting a Gauss-Hermite (GH) parameterization of the
line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD). We confirm that the strongest
signature of the presence of two counter-rotating stellar disks is the
symmetric double peak in the velocity dispersion map, already known as the
$2\sigma$ feature. The size, shape, and slope of the 2$\sigma$ peak strongly
depend on the velocity separation and relative light contribution of the two
counter-rotating stellar disks. When the $2\sigma$ peak is difficult to detect
due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data, the large-scale structure in
the $h_3$ map can be used as a diagnostic for strong and weak counter-rotation.
The counter-rotating kinematic signatures become fainter at lower viewing
angles as an effect of the smaller projected velocity separation between the
two counter-rotating components. We confirm that the observed frequency of
$2\sigma$ galaxies represents only a lower limit of the stellar
counter-rotation phenomenon.

model is a subspace model with variations: the subspace may be known or known

four general classes of detectors and, within each class, there is a detector

that faster convergence rates are possible for problems with low noise, often
quantified by the performance of the best hypothesis; such results are known as
first-order or small-loss guarantees. While first-order guarantees are
relatively well understood in statistical and online learning, adapting to low
noise in contextual bandits (and more broadly, decision making) presents major
algorithmic challenges. In a COLT 2017 open problem, Agarwal, Krishnamurthy,
Langford, Luo, and Schapire asked whether first-order guarantees are even
possible for contextual bandits and -- if so -- whether they can be attained by
efficient algorithms. We give a resolution to this question by providing an
optimal and efficient reduction from contextual bandits to online regression
with the logarithmic (or, cross-entropy) loss. Our algorithm is simple and
practical, readily accommodates rich function classes, and requires no
distributional assumptions beyond realizability. In a large-scale empirical
evaluation, we find that our approach typically outperforms comparable
non-first-order methods.
  On the technical side, we show that the logarithmic loss and an
information-theoretic quantity called the triangular discrimination play a
fundamental role in obtaining first-order guarantees, and we combine this
observation with new refinements to the regression oracle reduction framework
of Foster and Rakhlin. The use of triangular discrimination yields novel
results even for the classical statistical learning model, and we anticipate
that it will find broader use.

natural language processing, they require orders of magnitude more training
data, GPU memory, and computations in order to compete with convolutional
neural networks for computer vision. The attention mechanism of transformers
scales quadratically with the length of the input sequence, and unrolled images
have long sequence lengths. Plus, transformers lack an inductive bias that is
appropriate for images. We tested three modifications to vision transformer
(ViT) architectures that address these shortcomings. Firstly, we alleviate the
quadratic bottleneck by using linear attention mechanisms, called X-formers
(such that, X in {Performer, Linformer, Nystr\""omformer}), thereby creating
Vision X-formers (ViXs). This resulted in up to a seven times reduction in the
GPU memory requirement. We also compared their performance with FNet and
multi-layer perceptron mixers, which further reduced the GPU memory
requirement. Secondly, we introduced an inductive bias for images by replacing
the initial linear embedding layer by convolutional layers in ViX, which
significantly increased classification accuracy without increasing the model
size. Thirdly, we replaced the learnable 1D position embeddings in ViT with
Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which increases the classification accuracy
for the same model size. We believe that incorporating such changes can
democratize transformers by making them accessible to those with limited data
and computing resources.

  of Tony Springer",,,,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In [Frobenius1896] it was shown that many important properties of a finite
group could be examined using formulas involving the character ratios of group
elements, i.e., the trace of the element acting in a given irreducible
representation, divided by the dimension of the representation. In
[Gurevich-Howe15] and [Gurevich-Howe17], the current authors introduced the
notion of rank of an irreducible representation of a finite classical group.
One of the motivations for studying rank was to clarify the nature of character
ratios for certain elements in these groups. In fact in the above cited papers,
two notions of rank were given. The first is the Fourier theoretic based notion
of U-rank of a representation, which comes up when one looks at its
restrictions to certain abelian unipotent subgroups. The second is the more
algebraic based notion of tensor rank which comes up naturally when one
attempts to equip the representation ring of the group with a grading that
reflects the central role played by the few ""smallest"" possible representations
of the group. In [Gurevich-Howe17] we conjectured that the two notions of rank
mentioned just above agree on a suitable collection called ""low rank""
representations. In this note we review the development of the theory of rank
for the case of the general linear group GL_n over a finite field F_q, and give
a proof of the ""agreement conjecture"" that holds true for sufficiently large q.
Our proof is Fourier theoretic in nature, and uses a certain curious positivity
property of the Fourier transform of the set of matrices of low enough fixed
rank in the vector space of matrices of size m x n over F_q. In order to make
the story we are trying to tell clear, we choose in this note to follow a
particular example that shows how one might apply the theory of rank to certain
counting problems.

essential parts of our everyday lives. These systems are composed of units
which interact through intricate networks. The ability to predict sudden
changes in the dynamics of these networks, known as critical transitions, from
data is important to avert disastrous consequences of major disruptions.
Predicting such changes is a major challenge as it requires forecasting the
behaviour for parameter ranges for which no data on the system is available. We
address this issue for networks with weak individual interactions and chaotic
local dynamics. We do this by building a model network, termed an {\em
effective network}, consisting of the underlying local dynamics and a
statistical description of their interactions. We show that behaviour of such
networks can be decomposed in terms of an emergent deterministic component and
a {\em fluctuation} term. Traditionally, such fluctuations are filtered out.
However, as we show, they are key to accessing the interaction structure.

  Choice",,,,,"q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis mainly focuses on two problems in capital structure and
individual's life-cycle portfolio choice. In the first problem, we derive a
stochastic control model to optimize banks' dividend and recapitalization
policies and calibrate that to a sample of U.S. banks in the situation where we
model banks' true accounting asset values as partially observed variables due
to the opaqueness in banks' assets. By the calibrated model, the noise in
reported accounting asset values hides about one-third of the true asset return
volatility and raises the banks' market equity value by 7.8\% because the noise
hides the banks' solvency risk from banking regulators. Particularly, those
banks with a high level of loan loss provisions, nonperforming assets, and real
estate loans, and with a low volatility of reported total assets have noisy
accounting asset values. Because of the substantial shock on the true asset
values, the banks' assets were more opaque during the recent financial crisis.
In the second problem, we present an optimal portfolio selection model with
voluntary retirement option in an economic situation, where an investor is
facing borrowing and short sale constraints, as well as the cointegration
between the stock and labor markets. Our model reinterprets the
non-participation puzzle in stock investment and early retirement in market
booms. Investor's willingness to retire earlier becomes stronger as risk
aversion increases or as wages decline in the long term. Consistent with the
empirical evidence, we find that retirement flexibility makes the optimal
portfolio invest less in the stock market. We also find that our
model-generated portfolio share rises in wealth.

prevent programmer bugs related to data-plane state, and an open-sourced

These features make Lucid general and easy to use, as we demonstrate by writing
a suite of ten different data-plane applications in Lucid. Working prototypes
take well under an hour to write, even for a programmer without prior Tofino
experience, have around 10x fewer lines of code compared to P4, and compile
efficiently to real hardware. In a stateful firewall written in Lucid, we find
that moving control from a switch's CPU to its data-plane processor using Lucid

positively charged oxygen vacancies in the oxide film, and Cl adsorption on
passivating oxide surfaces, substituting for surface hydroxyl groups. In this
work, we conduct large-scale first principles modeling of explicit
metal/Al(2)O(3) interfaces to investigate the energetics and electronic

allow electron transfer that mimics electrochemical events, and the
establishment of the relation between atomic structures at different interfaces
and the electronic band alignment. For multiple model interfaces, we find that
doubly charged oxygen vacancies, which are key ingredients of the point defect

depending on the voltage. We also discuss the challenges associated with

require an increase of 0.8 V in applied electrochemical potential to nucleate
the 1T' phase in MoS2 compared to hBN-MoS2 heterointerfaces. The increased
nucleation barrier at graphene-MoS2 heterointerfaces is due to the reduced
charge transfer from lithium to MoS2 at the heterointerface as lithium also
dopes graphene based on ab initio calculations. Further, we show that the
growth of the 1T' domain propagates along the heterointerface, rather than
through the interior of MoS2. Our results provide the first experimental

characteristics of 21cm intensity mapping data. While these components would
ordinarily have distinctive frequency spectra, making it relatively easy to
separate them, instrumental effects and calibration errors further complicate
matters by modulating and mixing them together. A popular class of foreground
cleaning method are unsupervised techniques related to Principal Component
Analysis (PCA), which exploit the different shapes and amplitudes of each
component's contribution to the covariance of the data in order to segregate
the signals. These methods have been shown to be effective at removing
foregrounds, while also unavoidably filtering out some of the 21cm signal too.
In this paper we examine, for the first time in the context of 21cm intensity
mapping, a generalised method called Kernel PCA, which instead operates on the
covariance of non-linear transformations of the data. This allows more flexible
functional bases to be constructed, in principle allowing a cleaner separation
between foregrounds and the 21cm signal to be found. We show that Kernel PCA is
effective when applied to simulated single-dish (autocorrelation) 21cm data
under a variety of assumptions about foregrounds models, instrumental effects
etc. It presents a different set of behaviours to PCA, e.g. in terms of
sensitivity to the data resolution and smoothing scale, outperforming it on
intermediate to large scales in most scenarios.

preferences and adversarial availabilities (DB-SPAA). In almost all dueling
bandit applications, the decision space often changes over time; eg, retail
store management, online shopping, restaurant recommendation, search engine
optimization, etc. Surprisingly, this `sleeping aspect' of dueling bandits has
never been studied in the literature. Like dueling bandits, the goal is to
compete with the best arm by sequentially querying the preference feedback of
item pairs. The non-triviality however results due to the non-stationary item
spaces that allow any arbitrary subsets items to go unavailable every round.
The goal is to find an optimal `no-regret' policy that can identify the best
available item at each round, as opposed to the standard `fixed best-arm regret
objective' of dueling bandits. We first derive an instance-specific lower bound
for DB-SPAA $\Omega( \sum_{i =1}^{K-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^K \frac{\log
T}{\Delta(i,j)})$, where $K$ is the number of items and $\Delta(i,j)$ is the
gap between items $i$ and $j$. This indicates that the sleeping problem with
preference feedback is inherently more difficult than that for classical
multi-armed bandits (MAB). We then propose two algorithms, with near optimal
regret guarantees. Our results are corroborated empirically.

based software systems in many industries. Designing a DL program requires
constructing a deep neural network (DNN) and then training it on a dataset.
This process requires that developers make multiple architectural (e.g., type,
size, number, and order of layers) and configuration (e.g., optimizer,
regularization methods, and activation functions) choices that affect the
quality of the DL models, and consequently software quality. An under-specified
or poorly-designed DL model may train successfully but is likely to perform
poorly when deployed in production. Design smells in DL programs are poor
design and-or configuration decisions taken during the development of DL
components, that are likely to have a negative impact on the performance (i.e.,
prediction accuracy) and then quality of DL based software systems. In this
paper, we present a catalogue of 8 design smells for a popular DL architecture,
namely deep Feedforward Neural Networks which is widely employed in industrial
applications. The design smells were identified through a review of the
existing literature on DL design and a manual inspection of 659 DL programs
with performance issues and design inefficiencies. The smells are specified by
describing their context, consequences, and recommended refactorings. To
provide empirical evidence on the relevance and perceived impact of the
proposed design smells, we conducted a survey with 81 DL developers. In
general, the developers perceived the proposed design smells as reflective of
design or implementation problems, with agreement levels varying between 47\%
and 68\%.

waiting-time density generating functions with Bell polynomials. We derive the
discrete-time renewal equations governing the time-evolution of the ADTRW and
analyze recurrent/transient features of simple ADTRWs (walks with unit jumps in
both directions). We explore the connections of the recurrence/transience with
the bias: Transient simple ADTRWs are biased and vice verse. Recurrent simple
ADTRWs are either unbiased in the large time limit or `strictly unbiased' at
all times with symmetric Bernoulli generator process. In this analysis we
highlight the connections of bias and light-tailed/fat-tailed features of the
waiting time density in the generator process. As a prototypical example with

is computed sequentially. One approach to alleviate this and achieve
parallelism in time is with multigrid. In this work, we consider
multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT), a multilevel method applied to the time
dimension that computes multiple time-steps in parallel. Like all multigrid
methods, MGRIT relies on the complementary relationship between relaxation on a
fine-grid and a correction from the coarse grid to solve the problem. All
current MGRIT implementations are based on unweighted-Jacobi relaxation; here
we introduce the concept of weighted relaxation to MGRIT. We derive new
convergence bounds for weighted relaxation, and use this analysis to guide the
selection of relaxation weights. Numerical results then demonstrate that
non-unitary relaxation weights consistently yield faster convergence rates and
lower iteration counts for MGRIT when compared with unweighted relaxation. In
most cases, weighted relaxation yields a 10%-20% saving in iterations. For
A-stable integration schemes, results also illustrate that under-relaxation can
restore convergence in some cases where unweighted relaxation is not

these directional searches have focused on mapping the intensity of the signal

approach to a previously proposed, but never employed, amplitude-phase mapping
method to understand whether this latter approach may be employed in future
searches. We build up our understanding of the differences between these two
approaches by analysing simple toy models of time-stream data, and run
mock-data mapping tests for the two methods. We find that the amplitude-phase
method is only applicable to the case of a background which is phase-coherent
on large scales or, at the very least, has an intrinsic coherence scale that is
larger than that of the detector. Otherwise, the amplitude-phase mapping method
leads to a loss of overall information, with respect to both phase and
amplitude. Since we do not expect these phase-coherent properties to hold for
any of the gravitational-wave background signals we hope to detect in the near
future, we conclude that intensity mapping is the preferred method for such

assuming it a priori. We consider the $\Lambda$CDM model endowed with a
spherical $\Lambda$LTB inhomogeneity around us, that is, we assume isotropy and
test the hypothesis of homogeneity. We confront the $\Lambda$LTB model with the
latest available data from CMB, BAO, type Ia supernovae, local $H_0$, cosmic
chronometers, Compton y-distortion and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. We
find that these data can constrain tightly this extra inhomogeneity, almost to
the cosmic variance level: on scales $\gtrsim 100$ Mpc structures can have a
small non-Copernican effective contrast of just $\delta_L \sim 0.01$.
Furthermore, the constraints on the standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters are not
weakened after marginalizing over the parameters that model the local
structure, to which we assign ignorance priors. In other words, dropping the
Copernican principle assumption does not imply worse constraints on the
cosmological parameters. This positive result confirms that the present and
future data can be meaningfully analyzed within the framework of inhomogeneous
cosmology.

(HDR) imaging recently and have received a lot of attention. The quality of
DCNN-generated HDR images has overperformed the traditional counterparts.
However, DCNNs are prone to be computationally intensive and power-hungry, and
hence cannot be implemented on various embedded computing platforms with
limited power and hardware resources. Embedded systems have a huge market, and
utilizing DCNNs' powerful functionality into them will further reduce human
intervention. To address the challenge, we propose LightFuse, a lightweight
CNN-based algorithm for extreme dual-exposure image fusion, which achieves
better functionality than a conventional DCNN and can be deployed in embedded
systems. Two sub-networks are utilized: a GlobalNet (G) and a DetailNet (D).
The goal of G is to learn the global illumination information on the spatial
dimension, whereas D aims to enhance local details on the channel dimension.
Both G and D are based solely on depthwise convolution (D_Conv) and pointwise
convolution (P_Conv) to reduce required parameters and computations.
Experimental results show that this proposed technique could generate HDR
images in extremely exposed regions with sufficient details to be legible. Our
model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in peak signal-to-noise

entanglement witnesses for bipartite and tripartite qubit (and qudit) target

clearly delineates between separable states and the target entangled state;
this hyperplane is a weighted sum of observables ('features') whose
coefficients are optimized during the training of the SVM. We demonstrate with
this method the ability to obtain witnesses that require only local
measurements even when the target state is a non-stabilizer state. Furthermore,
we show that SVMs are flexible enough to allow us to rank features, and to
reduce the number of features systematically while bounding the inference
error. This allows us to derive W state witnesses capable of detecting
entanglement with fewer measurement terms than the fidelity method dominant in
today's literature. The utility of this approach is demonstrated on quantum
hardware furnished through the IBM Quantum Experience.

GIGANTES suite, spanning thousands of cosmological models, opens up the study
of voids, answering compelling questions: Do voids carry unique cosmological
information? How is this information correlated with galaxy information?
Leveraging the large number of voids in the GIGANTES suite, our Fisher
constraints demonstrate voids contain additional information, critically
tightening constraints on cosmological parameters. We use traditional void
summary statistics (void size function, void density profile) and the void
auto-correlation function, which independently yields an error of
$0.13\,\mathrm{eV}$ on $\sum\,m_{\nu}$ for a 1 $h^{-3}\mathrm{Gpc}^3$
simulation, without CMB priors. Combining halos and voids we forecast an error
of $0.09\,\mathrm{eV}$ from the same volume. Extrapolating to next generation
multi-Gpc$^3$ surveys such as DESI, Euclid, SPHEREx, and the Roman Space
Telescope, we expect voids should yield an independent determination of
neutrino mass. Crucially, GIGANTES is the first void catalog suite expressly
built for intensive machine learning exploration. We illustrate this by
training a neural network to perform likelihood-free inference on the void size
function. Cosmology problems provide an impetus to develop novel deep learning
techniques, leveraging the symmetries embedded throughout the universe from
physical laws, interpreting models, and accurately predicting errors. With

  Effective Sparsity",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with surging interest
in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on
faithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been
traditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct
sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters
that detached from input or output layers of underlying subnetworks,
potentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of
inactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately
pruned networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it plays an
increasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between
different pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression
of a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its
direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow
for pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this work, we adopt the lens of effective
sparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark
architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their
absolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new and more
appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we
develop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with
effective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random
pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or
better than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et
al., 2020]. In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of pressure
distribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise
sparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random
pruning.

new Wide Field of View (2.3deg x 2.3deg) small aperture (30cm) telescopes will
be deployed in 2021, at the Pampilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO),
located in the center of the continental Portuguese territory, in the heart of
a certified Dark Sky area. These optical systems will provide added value
capabilities to the Portuguese SST network, complementing the optical
telescopes currently in commissioning in Madeira and Azores. These telescopes
are optimized for GEO and MEO survey operations and besides the required SST
operational capability, they will also provide an important development
component to the Portuguese SST network. The telescopes will be equipped with
filter wheels, being able to perform observations in several optical bands
including white light, BVRI bands and narrow band filters such as H(alpha) and
O[III] to study potential different objects' albedos. This configuration
enables us to conduct a study on space debris classification$/$characterization
using combinations of different colors aiming the production of improved color
index schemes to be incorporated in the automatic pipelines for classification
of space debris. This optical sensor will also be used to conduct studies on
image processing algorithms, including source extraction and classification
solutions through the application of machine learning techniques. Since SST
dedicated telescopes produce a large quantity of data per observation night,
fast, efficient and automatic image processing techniques are mandatory. A
platform like this one, dedicated to the development of Space Surveillance
studies, will add a critical capability to keep the Portuguese SST network
updated, and as a consequence it may provide useful developments to the
European SST network as well.

instruments, forcing the main surgeon to rely on a second surgeon to act as a
camera assistant. In addition to the burden of excessively involving surgical
staff, this may lead to reduced image stability, increased task completion time
and sometimes errors due to the monotony of the task. Robotic endoscope
holders, controlled by a set of basic instructions, have been proposed as an
alternative, but their unnatural handling may increase the cognitive load of
the (solo) surgeon, which hinders their clinical acceptance. More seamless
integration in the surgical workflow would be achieved if robotic endoscope
holders collaborated with the operating surgeon via semantically rich
instructions that closely resemble instructions that would otherwise be issued
to a human camera assistant, such as ""focus on my right-hand instrument"". As a
proof of concept, this paper presents a novel system that paves the way towards
a synergistic interaction between surgeons and robotic endoscope holders. The
proposed platform allows the surgeon to perform a bimanual coordination and
navigation task, while a robotic arm autonomously performs the endoscope
positioning tasks. Within our system, we propose a novel tooltip localization
method based on surgical tool segmentation and a novel visual servoing approach
that ensures smooth and appropriate motion of the endoscope camera. We validate
our vision pipeline and run a user study of this system. The clinical relevance
of the study is ensured through the use of a laparoscopic exercise validated by
the European Academy of Gynaecological Surgery which involves bi-manual

provides a promising starting point towards broader clinical adoption of
robotic endoscope holders.

  In fact, we study memory-sample lower bounds for a large class of learning
problems, as characterized by [GRT'18], when the samples are noisy. A matrix
$M: A \times X \rightarrow \{-1,1\}$ corresponds to the following learning
problem with error parameter $\varepsilon$: an unknown element $x \in X$ is
chosen uniformly at random. A learner tries to learn $x$ from a stream of
samples, $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \ldots$, where for every $i$, $a_i \in A$ is

submatrix of $M$ of at least $2^{-k} \cdot |A|$ rows and at least $2^{-\ell}

algorithm for the learning problem corresponding to $M$, with error, requires
either a memory of size at least $\Omega\left(\frac{k \cdot \ell}{\varepsilon}

for a large class of learning problems, same as those in [GRT'18], any learning

  Our proof is based on adapting the arguments in [Raz'17,GRT'18] to the noisy

interpretation of quasi-equilibrium that governs the momentum balance

law-of-the-wall velocity profile for a smooth surface into the wall-normal
integrated momentum balance, leading to a Lagrangian relaxation towards
equilibrium (LaRTE) transport equation for the friction velocity vector
$\mathbf{u}_\tau(x,z,t)$. This partial differential equation includes a
relaxation timescale governing the rate at which the wall stress can respond to
imposed fluctuations due to the inertia of the fluid layer from the wall to the
wall-model height. A-priori tests based on channel flow direct numerical
simulation (DNS) data show that the identified relaxation timescale ensures
self-consistency with assumed quasi-equilibrium conditions. The new approach
enables us to formally distinguish quasi-equilibrium from additional,
non-equilibrium contributions to the wall stress. A particular model for
non-equilibrium contributions is derived, motivated by laminar Stokes layer
dynamics in the viscous sublayer when applying fast varying pressure gradients.
The new wall modeling approach is first tested in standard equilibrium channel
flow in order to document various properties of the approach. The model is then
applied in LES of channel flow with a suddenly applied spanwise pressure
gradient (SSPG). The resulting mean wall stress evolution is compared to DNS
with good agreement. At the onset of the SSPG, the laminar Stokes layer
develops rapidly while the LaRTE portion of the stress has a delayed response
due to its inherent relaxation dynamics. Results also highlight open challenges
such as modeling the response of near-wall turbulence occurring above the
viscous sublayer and at timescales faster than quasi-equilibrium conditions.

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac11f9",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The complexity of constraining the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in
early-type galaxies cannot be overstated, given the necessity of both very high
signal-to-noise (S/N) data and the difficulty of breaking the strong
degeneracies that occur among several stellar population parameters including
age, metallicity and elemental abundances. With this paper, the second in a
series, we present a detailed analysis of the biases that can occur when
retrieving the IMF shape by exploiting both optical and NIR IMF sensitive
spectral indices. As a test case, here we analyze data for the nearby galaxy
M89, for which we have high S/N spectroscopic data that cover the
3500-9000{\AA} spectral region and allow us to study the radial variation of
the stellar population properties out to 1 R_e. Carrying out parallel
simulations that mimic the retrieval of all the explored stellar parameters
from a known input model, we quantify the amount of bias at each step of our
analysis. From more general simulations we conclude that to accurately retrieve
the IMF, it is necessary not only to retrieve accurate estimates of the age and
metallicity, but also of all the elemental abundances that the spectral index
fits are sensitive to. With our analysis technique applied to M89, we find
consistency with a bottom-heavy IMF with a negative gradient from the center to
half R_e when using the Conroy et al. 2018 as well as Vazdekis et al. 2016
EMILES stellar population models. We find agreement both with a parallel full
spectral fitting of the same data and with literature results.

medical imaging applications. To date, most of the proposed methods for DL-SR
have only been assessed by use of traditional measures of image quality (IQ)
that are commonly employed in the field of computer vision. However, the impact
of these methods on objective measures of image quality that are relevant to
medical imaging tasks remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate
the impact of DL-SR methods on binary signal detection performance. Two popular
DL-SR methods, the super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and
the super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN), were trained by
use of simulated medical image data. Binary signal-known-exactly with
background-known-statistically (SKE/BKS) and signal-known-statistically with
background-known-statistically (SKS/BKS) detection tasks were formulated.
Numerical observers, which included a neural network-approximated ideal
observer and common linear numerical observers, were employed to assess the
impact of DL-SR on task performance. The impact of the complexity of the DL-SR
network architectures on task-performance was quantified. In addition, the
utility of DL-SR for improving the task-performance of sub-optimal observers
was investigated. Our numerical experiments confirmed that, as expected, DL-SR
could improve traditional measures of IQ. However, for many of the study
designs considered, the DL-SR methods provided little or no improvement in task
performance and could even degrade it. It was observed that DL-SR could improve
the task-performance of sub-optimal observers under certain conditions. The
presented study highlights the urgent need for the objective assessment of
DL-SR methods and suggests avenues for improving their efficacy in medical
imaging applications.

often comes with the penalty of strong-drive effects that are not captured by
the rotating-wave approximation. These effects can be analyzed in simulations
of the gate protocol, but those are computationally costly and often hide the
physics at play. Here, we show how to efficiently extract gate parameters by
directly solving a Floquet eigenproblem using exact numerics and a perturbative
analytical approach. As an example application of this toolkit, we study the
space of parametric gates generated between two fixed-frequency transmon qubits
connected by a parametrically driven coupler. Our analytical treatment, based
on time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory, yields closed-form
expressions for gate frequencies and spurious interactions, and is valid for
strong drives. From these calculations, we identify optimal regimes of
operation for different types of gates including $i$SWAP, controlled-Z, and
CNOT. These analytical results are supplemented by numerical Floquet
computations from which we directly extract drive-dependent gate parameters.
This approach has a considerable computational advantage over full simulations
of time evolutions. More generally, our combined analytical and numerical
strategy allows us to characterize two-qubit gates involving parametrically
driven interactions, and can be applied to gate optimization and cross-talk
mitigation such as the cancellation of unwanted ZZ interactions in multi-qubit
architectures.

duration of our X-ray observations, in addition to persistent radio emission
and occasional radio flares. Simultaneous radio and X-ray data show no clear
evidence of anti-correlated variability. Optical spectra of NGC 6652B indicate
variable, broad H $\alpha$ emission which transitions from double-peaked
emission to absorption over a time-scale of hours. We consider a variety of

Noise-robust K-fold Cross-Validation Selection (E-NKCVS) to effectively select
clean samples from noisy data, solving the first problem. For the second

given to the pseudo label and the given label. Theoretical analysis and

inevitable: the human might push, pull, twist, or guide the robot. The
state-of-the-art treats these interactions as disturbances that the robot
should reject or avoid. At best, these robots respond safely while the human
interacts; but after the human lets go, these robots simply return to their
original behavior. We recognize that physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is
often intentional -- the human intervenes on purpose because the robot is not
doing the task correctly. In this paper, we argue that when pHRI is intentional
it is also informative: the robot can leverage interactions to learn how it
should complete the rest of its current task even after the person lets go. We
formalize pHRI as a dynamical system, where the human has in mind an objective
function they want the robot to optimize, but the robot does not get direct
access to the parameters of this objective -- they are internal to the human.
Within our proposed framework human interactions become observations about the
true objective. We introduce approximations to learn from and respond to pHRI
in real-time. We recognize that not all human corrections are perfect: often
users interact with the robot noisily, and so we improve the efficiency of
robot learning from pHRI by reducing unintended learning. Finally, we conduct
simulations and user studies on a robotic manipulator to compare our proposed
approach to the state-of-the-art. Our results indicate that learning from pHRI
leads to better task performance and improved human satisfaction.

checked by a third-party tool. Logical transformations are considered in a
higher-order logic, with type polymorphism and built-in theories such as
equality and integer arithmetic. We develop a language of proof certificates
for them and use it to implement the full chain of certificate generation and
certificate verification.

utilizing a complementarity of speech separation and speaker clustering. Since
the conventional clustering-based speaker diarization (CSD) approach cannot
well handle overlapping speech segments, we investigate, in this study,
separation-based speaker diarization (SSD) which inherently has the potential
to handle the speaker overlap regions. Our preliminary analysis shows that the
state-of-the-art Conv-TasNet based speech separation, which works quite well on
the simulation data, is unstable in realistic conversational speech due to the
high mismatch speaking styles in simulated training speech and read speech. In
doing so, separation-based processing can assist CSD in handling the
overlapping speech segments under the realistic mismatched conditions.
Specifically, several strategies are designed to select between the results of
SSD and CSD systems based on an analysis of the instability of the SSD system
performances. Experiments on the conversational telephone speech (CTS) data

improve the performance of state-of-the-art CSD systems, yielding relative

for energy efficiency. The increase in connection density increases on-chip
data movement, which makes efficient on-chip communication a critical function
of the DNN accelerator. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we
illustrate that the point-to-point (P2P)-based interconnect is incapable of
handling a high volume of on-chip data movement for DNNs. Second, we evaluate
P2P and network-on-chip (NoC) interconnect (with a regular topology such as a
mesh) for SRAM- and ReRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) architectures for a
range of DNNs. This analysis shows the necessity for the optimal interconnect
choice for an IMC DNN accelerator. Finally, we perform an experimental
evaluation for different DNNs to empirically obtain the performance of the IMC
architecture with both NoC-tree and NoC-mesh. We conclude that, at the tile
level, NoC-tree is appropriate for compact DNNs employed at the edge, and
NoC-mesh is necessary to accelerate DNNs with high connection density.
Furthermore, we propose a technique to determine the optimal choice of
interconnect for any given DNN. In this technique, we use analytical models of
NoC to evaluate end-to-end communication latency of any given DNN. We
demonstrate that the interconnect optimization in the IMC architecture results
in up to 6$\times$ improvement in energy-delay-area product for VGG-19
inference compared to the state-of-the-art ReRAM-based IMC architectures.

motivating intuition is human language in which communication occurs through
discrete symbols. Even though individuals have different understandings of what

it possible for communication among individuals to be unimpeded by individual
differences in internal representation. To discretize the values of concepts

multi-headed discretization with shared codebooks and use it for
discrete-valued neural communication (DVNC). Our experiments show that DVNC
substantially improves systematic generalization in a variety of architectures

and Szab\'{o} and Tardos in 2006. In this paper we investigate the $r>t+1$ case
of the problem, which has remained dormant for over forty years. We resolve the
problem exactly in the case when $r \equiv -1 \pmod{t}$, and up to an additive
constant for many other cases, including when $r \geq (3t-1)(t-1)$. Our
approach utilizes a connection to the related problem of determining the
maximum of the minimum degrees among the family of balanced $r$-partite
$rn$-vertex graphs of chromatic number at most $t$.

  Ness Shroff","Weighted Gaussian Process Bandits for Non-stationary Environments",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the Gaussian process (GP) bandit optimization
problem in a non-stationary environment. To capture external changes, the
black-box function is allowed to be time-varying within a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS). To this end, we develop WGP-UCB, a novel UCB-type
algorithm based on weighted Gaussian process regression. A key challenge is how
to cope with infinite-dimensional feature maps. To that end, we leverage kernel
approximation techniques to prove a sublinear regret bound, which is the first
(frequentist) sublinear regret guarantee on weighted time-varying bandits with
general nonlinear rewards. This result generalizes both non-stationary linear
bandits and standard GP-UCB algorithms. Further, a novel concentration
inequality is achieved for weighted Gaussian process regression with general
weights. We also provide universal upper bounds and weight-dependent upper
bounds for weighted maximum information gains. These results are of independent
interest for applications such as news ranking and adaptive pricing, where
weights can be adopted to capture the importance or quality of data. Finally,
we conduct experiments to highlight the favorable gains of the proposed
algorithm in many cases when compared to existing methods.

Deligne (2002) states that a pre-Tannakian
category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero admits a
fiber functor to the category of supervector spaces (i.e., is the
representation category of an affine proalgebraic supergroup) if and only if it
has moderate growth (i.e., the lengths of tensor powers of an object grow at
most exponentially). In this paper we prove a characteristic p version of this
theorem. Namely we show that a pre-Tannakian category over an algebraically
closed field of characteristic p>0 admits a fiber functor into the Verlinde
category Ver_p (i.e., is the representation category of an affine group scheme
in Ver_p) if and only if it has moderate growth and is Frobenius exact. This
implies that Frobenius exact pre-Tannakian categories of moderate growth admit
a well-behaved notion of Frobenius-Perron dimension.
  It follows that any semisimple pre-Tannakian category of moderate growth has
a fiber functor to Ver_p (so in particular Deligne's theorem holds on the nose
for semisimple pre-Tannakian categories in characteristics 2,3). This settles a
conjecture of the third author from 2015.
  In particular, this result applies to semisimplifications of categories of
modular representations of finite groups (or, more generally, affine group
schemes), which gives new applications to classical modular representation
theory. For example, it allows us to characterize, for a modular representation
V, the possible growth rates of the number of indecomposable summands in
V^{\otimes n} of dimension prime to p.

collaboratively training deep learning models without sharing patient data.
However, the data from different institutions are usually heterogeneous across
institutions, which may reduce the performance of models trained using
federated learning. In this study, we propose a novel heterogeneity-aware
federated learning method, SplitAVG, to overcome the performance drops from
data heterogeneity in federated learning. Unlike previous federated methods
that require complex heuristic training or hyper parameter tuning, our SplitAVG
leverages the simple network split and feature map concatenation strategies to
encourage the federated model training an unbiased estimator of the target data
distribution. We compare SplitAVG with seven state-of-the-art federated
learning methods, using centrally hosted training data as the baseline on a
suite of both synthetic and real-world federated datasets. We find that the
performance of models trained using all the comparison federated learning
methods degraded significantly with the increasing degrees of data
heterogeneity. In contrast, SplitAVG method achieves comparable results to the
baseline method under all heterogeneous settings, that it achieves 96.2% of the
accuracy and 110.4% of the mean absolute error obtained by the baseline in a
diabetic retinopathy binary classification dataset and a bone age prediction
dataset, respectively, on highly heterogeneous data partitions. We conclude
that SplitAVG method can effectively overcome the performance drops from
variability in data distributions across institutions. Experimental results
also show that SplitAVG can be adapted to different base networks and
generalized to various types of medical imaging tasks.

to generalize to new query tasks by leveraging the meta-learned learning

Specifically, this function is represented as a parameterized function called
meta-learner, mapping from a training/test task to its suitable hyper-parameter
setting, extracted from a pre-specified function set called meta learning
machine. Such setting guarantees that the meta-learned learning methodology is
able to flexibly fit diverse query tasks, instead of only obtaining fixed
hyper-parameters by many current meta learning methods, with less adaptability
to query task's variations. Such understanding of meta learning also makes it
easily succeed from traditional learning theory for analyzing its
generalization bounds with general losses/tasks/models. The theory naturally
leads to some feasible controlling strategies for ameliorating the quality of

decomposition exploits the sparsity of semidefinite matrices in a semidefinite
program (SDP), in order to formulate an equivalent SDP with smaller

decompositions, instead, relax or strengthen SDPs with dense semidefinite

lower computational complexity. This article reviews recent advances in
large-scale semidefinite and polynomial optimization enabled by these two types
of decomposition, highlighting connections and differences between them. We
also demonstrate that chordal and factor-width decompositions allow for
significant computational savings on a range of classical problems from control

possible directions for future research that have the potential to facilitate
the efficient optimization-based study of increasingly complex large-scale

long-standing challenge as person images with different types of occlusions
often suffer from misalignment in image matching and ranking. Most existing
methods tackle this challenge by aligning spatial features of body parts
according to external semantic cues or feature similarities but this alignment
approach is complicated and sensitive to noises. We design DRL-Net, a
disentangled representation learning network that handles occluded re-ID
without requiring strict person image alignment or any additional supervision.
Leveraging transformer architectures, DRL-Net achieves alignment-free re-ID via
global reasoning of local features of occluded person images. It measures image
similarity by automatically disentangling the representation of undefined
semantic components, e.g., human body parts or obstacles, under the guidance of
semantic preference object queries in the transformer. In addition, we design a
decorrelation constraint in the transformer decoder and impose it over object
queries for better focus on different semantic components. To better eliminate
interference from occlusions, we design a contrast feature learning technique
(CFL) for better separation of occlusion features and discriminative ID
features. Extensive experiments over occluded and holistic re-ID benchmarks
(Occluded-DukeMTMC, Market1501 and DukeMTMC) show that the DRL-Net achieves
superior re-ID performance consistently and outperforms the state-of-the-art by
large margins for Occluded-DukeMTMC.

and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). In the framework, we first define
a feature vector $f(C)$ of a chemical graph $C$ and construct an ANN that maps
$x=f(C)$ to a predicted value $\eta(x)$ of a chemical property $\pi$ to $C$.
After this, we formulate an MILP that simulates the computation process of
$f(C)$ from $C$ and that of $\eta(x)$ from $x$. Given a target value $y^*$ of
the chemical property $\pi$, we infer a chemical graph $C^\dagger$ such that
$\eta(f(C^\dagger))=y^*$ by solving the MILP. In this paper, we use linear
regression to construct a prediction function $\eta$ instead of ANNs. For this,
we derive an MILP formulation that simulates the computation process of a
prediction function by linear regression. The results of computational
experiments suggest our method can infer chemical graphs with around up to 50
non-hydrogen atoms.

from any vertex can reach every other vertex in finite time, provided they are
connected. Discrete-time quantum walks on finite connected graphs however, can
have infinite hitting times. This phenomenon is related to graph symmetry, as
previously characterized by the group of direction-preserving graph
automorphisms that trivially affect the coin Hilbert space. If a graph is
symmetric enough (in a particular sense) then the associated quantum walk
unitary will contain eigenvectors that do not overlap a set of target vertices,
for any coin flip operator. These eigenvectors span the Infinite Hitting Time
(IHT) subspace. Quantum states in the IHT subspace never reach the target
vertices, leading to infinite hitting times. However, this is not the whole
story: the graph of the 3D cube does not satisfy this symmetry constraint, yet
quantum walks on this graph with certain symmetric coins can exhibit infinite
hitting times. We study the effect of coin symmetry by analyzing the group of
coin-permutation symmetries (CPS): graph automorphisms that act nontrivially on
the coin Hilbert space but leave the coin operator invariant. Unitaries using
highly symmetric coins with large CPS groups, such as the permutation-invariant
Grover coin, are associated with higher probabilities of never arriving, as a
result of their larger IHT subspaces.

Although remarkably computation and memory efficient, random sampling can

  Recommendation",,,"10.1145/3474085.3475266",,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visually-aware recommendation on E-commerce platforms aims to leverage visual
information of items to predict a user's preference. It is commonly observed
that user's attention to visual features does not always reflect the real
preference. Although a user may click and view an item in light of a visual
satisfaction of their expectations, a real purchase does not always occur due
to the unsatisfaction of other essential features (e.g., brand, material,
price). We refer to the reason for such a visually related interaction
deviating from the real preference as a visual bias. Existing visually-aware
models make use of the visual features as a separate collaborative signal
similarly to other features to directly predict the user's preference without
considering a potential bias, which gives rise to a visually biased
recommendation. In this paper, we derive a causal graph to identify and analyze
the visual bias of these existing methods. In this causal graph, the visual
feature of an item acts as a mediator, which could introduce a spurious
relationship between the user and the item. To eliminate this spurious
relationship that misleads the prediction of the user's real preference, an
intervention and a counterfactual inference are developed over the mediator.
Particularly, the Total Indirect Effect is applied for a debiased prediction
during the testing phase of the model. This causal inference framework is model
agnostic such that it can be integrated into the existing methods. Furthermore,
we propose a debiased visually-aware recommender system, denoted as CausalRec
to effectively retain the supportive significance of the visual information and
remove the visual bias. Extensive experiments are conducted on eight benchmark
datasets, which shows the state-of-the-art performance of CausalRec and the
efficacy of debiasing.

Understanding such physical processes is one of the main astrophysical
questions. HD 163296 is an interesting young stellar object for which infrared
and sub-millimeter observations have shown a prominent circumstellar disk with
gaps plausibly created by forming planets. This study aims at characterizing
the morphology of the inner disk in HD 163296 with multi-epoch near-infrared
interferometric observations performed with GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer (VLTI). Our goal is to depict the K-band (lambda_0 ~ 2.2 um)
structure of the inner rim with milliarcsecond (sub-au) angular resolution. Our
data is complemented with archival PIONIER (H-band; lambda_0 ~ 1.65 um) data of
the source. We performed a Gradient Descent parametric model fitting to recover
the sub-au morphology of our source. Our analysis shows the existence of an
asymmetry in the disk surrounding the central star of HD 163296. We confirm
variability of the disk structure in the inner ~2 mas (0.2 au). While
variability of the inner disk structure in this source has been suggested by
previous interferometric studies, this is the first time that it is confirmed
in the H- and K-bands by using a complete analysis of the closure phases and
squared visibilities over several epochs. Because of the separation from the
star, position changes, and persistence of this asymmetric structure on
timescales of several years, we argue that it is a dusty feature (e.g., a
vortex or dust clouds), probably, made by a mixing of sillicate and carbon dust
and/or refractory grains, inhomogeneously distributed above the mid-plane of
the disk.

for class imbalanced classification. Cross entropy (CE) loss, which is widely
used for image recognition, is learned so that the probability value of true
class is closer to one by back propagation. However, for imbalanced datasets,
the learning is insufficient for the classes with a small number of samples.
Therefore, we propose a novel classification method using the MSE loss that can
be learned the relationships of all classes no matter which image is input.
Unlike CE loss, MSE loss is possible to equalize the number of back propagation
for all classes and to learn the feature space considering the relationships
between classes as metric learning. Furthermore, instead of the usual one-hot
teacher label, we use a novel teacher label that takes the number of class
samples into account. This induces the outlying label which depends on the
number of samples in each class, and the class with a small number of samples
has outlying margin in a feature space. It is possible to create the feature
space for separating high-difficulty classes and low-difficulty classes. By the
experiments on imbalanced classification and semantic segmentation, we
confirmed that the proposed method was much improved in comparison with
standard CE loss and conventional methods, even though only the loss and
teacher labels were changed.

and mixed logit models. Our analysis provides insights into the sensitivity of
the demand for the London Underground with respect to travel attributes
(crowding density and travel time), the epidemic situation (confirmed new
COVID-19 cases), and interventions (vaccination rates and mandatory face
masks). Mandatory face masks and higher vaccination rates are the top two
drivers of travel demand for the London Underground during COVID-19. The
positive impact of vaccination rates on the Underground demand increases with
crowding density, and the positive effect of mandatory face masks decreases
with travel time. Mixed logit reveals substantial preference heterogeneity. For
instance, while the average effect of mandatory face masks is positive,
preferences of around 20% of the pre-pandemic users to travel by the
Underground are negatively affected. The estimated demand sensitivities are
relevant for supply-demand management in transit systems and the calibration of

image-specific: 1) They are trained on samples synthesized by predefined
degradations (e.g. bicubic downsampling), regardless of the domain gap between
training and testing data. 2) During testing, they super-resolve all images by
the same set of model weights, ignoring the degradation variety. As a result,
most previous methods may suffer a performance drop when the degradations of
test images are unknown and various (i.e. the case of blind SR). To address
these issues, we propose an online SR (ONSR) method. It does not rely on
predefined degradations and allows the model weights to be updated according to
the degradation of the test image. Specifically, ONSR consists of two branches,
namely internal branch (IB) and external branch (EB). IB could learn the
specific degradation of the given test LR image, and EB could learn to super
resolve images degraded by the learned degradation. In this way, ONSR could
customize a specific model for each test image, and thus get more robust to
various degradations. Extensive experiments on both synthesized and real-world
images show that ONSR can generate more visually favorable SR results and
achieve state-of-the-art performance in blind SR.

an approach and a tool to cluster SO questions based on intent using a
graph-based clustering approach. We selected four datasets of 10k, 20k, 30k &
40k SO questions without code-snippets or images involved, and performed
intent-based clustering on them. We have done a preliminary evaluation of our
tool by analyzing the resultant clusters using the commonly used metrics of
Silhouette coefficient, Calinkski-Harabasz Index, & Davies-Bouldin Index. We
performed clustering for 8 different threshold similarity values and analyzed
the intriguing trends reflected by the output clusters through the three
evaluation metrics. At 90% threshold similarity, it shows the best value for
the three evaluation metrics on all four datasets. The source code and tool are

shock using linear theory and nonlinear Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. We
focus on the Alfv\'en-ion-cyclotron (AIC), mirror, and Weibel instabilities,
which are all driven unstable by the effective temperature anisotropy induced
by the shock-reflected ions within the transition layer of a strictly
perpendicular shock. We conduct linear dispersion analysis with a homogeneous
plasma model to mimic the shock transition layer by adopting a ring
distribution with finite thermal spread to represent the velocity distribution
of the reflected ions. We find that, for wave propagation parallel to the
ambient magnetic field, the AIC instability at lower Alfv\'en Mach numbers
tends to transition to the Weibel instability at higher Alfv\'en Mach numbers.
The instability property is, however, also strongly affected by the sound Mach
number. We conclude that the instability at a strong shock with Alfv\'en and
sound Mach numbers both in excess of $\sim 20{\rm -}40$ may be considered as
Weibel-like in the sense that the reflected ions behave essentially
unmagnetized. Two-dimensional PIC simulations confirm the linear theory and
find that, with typical parameters of young supernova remnant shocks, the ring
distribution model produces magnetic fluctuations of the order of the
background magnetic field, which is smaller than those observed in previous PIC
simulations for Weibel-dominated shocks. This indicates that the assumption of
the gyrotropic reflected ion distribution may not be adequate to quantitatively
predict nonlinear behaviors of the dynamics in high Mach number shocks.

iterative development. An Agile team estimates the effort of a task based on
the available information which is usually conveyed through documentation.
However, as documentation has a lower priority in Agile, little is known about
how documentation effort can be optimized while achieving accurate estimation.
Hence, to help practitioners achieve just-enough documentation for effort
estimation, we investigated the different types of documented information that
practitioners considered useful for effort estimation. We conducted a survey
study with 121 Agile practitioners across 25 countries. Our survey results
showed that (1) despite the lower priority of documentation in Agile practices,
98% of the respondents considered documented information moderately to
extremely important when estimating effort, (2) 73% of them reported that they
would re-estimate a task when the documented information was changed, and (3)
functional requirements, user stories, definition of done, UI wireframes,
acceptance criteria, and task dependencies were ranked as the most useful types
of documented information for effort estimation. Nevertheless, many respondents
reported that these useful types of documented information were occasionally
changing or missing. Based on our study results, we provide recommendations for
agile practitioners on how effort estimation can be improved by focusing on
just-enough documentation.

others. In order to do so, we develop a unified width reduction method for
carefully handling these losses based on a more general set of potentials.

image registration problem, regularization is often used to constrain the
solution space. For most learning-based registration approaches, the
regularization usually has a fixed weight and only constrains the spatial
transformation. Such convention has two limitations: (i) Besides the laborious
grid search for the optimal fixed weight, the regularization strength of a
specific image pair should be associated with the content of the images, thus
the ""one value fits all"" training scheme is not ideal; (ii) Only spatially
regularizing the transformation may neglect some informative clues related to
the ill-posedness. In this study, we propose a mean-teacher based registration
framework, which incorporates an additional temporal consistency regularization
term by encouraging the teacher model's prediction to be consistent with that
of the student model. More importantly, instead of searching for a fixed
weight, the teacher enables automatically adjusting the weights of the spatial
regularization and the temporal consistency regularization by taking advantage
of the transformation uncertainty and appearance uncertainty. Extensive
experiments on the challenging abdominal CT-MRI registration show that our
training strategy can promisingly advance the original learning-based method in
terms of efficient hyperparameter tuning and a better tradeoff between accuracy

the detection and localization of these forgeries become quite necessary and

usually a lack of annotated forged images for training due to annotation
difficulties. In this paper, we propose a self-adversarial training strategy
and a reliable coarse-to-fine network that utilizes a self-attention mechanism
to localize forged regions in forgery images. The self-attention module is
based on a Channel-Wise High Pass Filter block (CW-HPF). CW-HPF leverages
inter-channel relationships of features and extracts noise features by high
pass filters. Based on the CW-HPF, a self-attention mechanism, called forgery
attention, is proposed to capture rich contextual dependencies of intrinsic
inconsistency extracted from tampered regions. Specifically, we append two
types of attention modules on top of CW-HPF respectively to model internal
interdependencies in spatial dimension and external dependencies among
channels. We exploit a coarse-to-fine network to enhance the noise
inconsistency between original and tampered regions. More importantly, to
address the issue of insufficient training data, we design a self-adversarial
training strategy that expands training data dynamically to achieve more robust
performance. Specifically, in each training iteration, we perform adversarial
attacks against our network to generate adversarial examples and train our
model on them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed

places by identifying visual cues, image regions or landmarks that have high
``utility'' in identifying a specific place. But this concept of utility is not
singular - rather it can take a range of forms. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to deduce two key types of utility for VPR: the utility of
visual cues `specific' to an environment, and to a particular place. We employ
contrastive learning principles to estimate both the environment- and
place-specific utility of Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD)
clusters in an unsupervised manner, which is then used to guide local feature
matching through keypoint selection. By combining these two utility measures,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging
benchmark datasets, while simultaneously reducing the required storage and
compute time. We provide further analysis demonstrating that unsupervised
cluster selection results in semantically meaningful results, that finer
grained categorization often has higher utility for VPR than high level
semantic categorization (e.g. building, road), and characterise how these two
utility measures vary across different places and environments. Source code is

catching a ball. A classification of clinical catching trials might give
insight into the existence of pathological alterations in the relation of arm
and ball movements. Accurate, but also early decisions are required to classify
a catching attempt before the catcher's first ball contact. To obtain
clinically valuable results, a significant decision confidence of at least 75%
is required. Hence, three competing objectives have to be optimized at the same
time: accuracy, earliness and decision-making confidence. Here we propose a
coupled classification and prediction approach for early time series
classification: a predictive, generative recurrent neural network (RNN)
forecasts the next data points of ball trajectories based on already available
observations; a discriminative RNN continuously generates classification
guesses based on the available data points and the unrolled sequence
predictions. We compare our approach, which we refer to as predictive
sequential classification (PSC), to state-of-the-art sequence learners,
including various RNN and temporal convolutional network (TCN) architectures.
On this hard real-world task we can consistently demonstrate the superiority of
PSC over all other models in terms of accuracy and confidence with respect to
earliness of recognition. Specifically, PSC is able to confidently classify the
success of catching trials as early as 123 milliseconds before the first ball
contact. We conclude that PSC is a promising approach for early time series
classification, when accurate and confident decisions are required.

metamodels have been successfully applied to reduce the computational cost of
the SBDO process. In this context, the paper presents the performance
assessment of an adaptive multi-fidelity metamodel based on a Gaussian process
regression (MF-GPR) for noisy data. The MF-GPR is developed to: (i) manage an
arbitrary number of fidelity levels, (ii) deal with objective function
evaluations affected by noise, and (iii) improve its fitting accuracy by
adaptive sampling. Multi-fidelity is achieved by bridging a low-fidelity
metamodel with metamodels of the error between successive fidelity levels. The
MF-GPR handles the numerical noise through regression. The adaptive sampling
method is based on the maximum prediction uncertainty and includes rules to
automatically select the fidelity to sample. The MF-GPR performance are
assessed on a set of five analytical benchmark problems affected by noisy
objective function evaluations. Since the noise introduces randomness in the
evaluation of the objective function, a statistical analysis approach is
adopted to assess the performance and the robustness of the MF-GPR. The paper
discusses the efficiency and effectiveness of the MF-GPR in globally
approximating the objective function and identifying the global minimum. One,
two, and three fidelity levels are used. The results of the statistical
analysis show that the use of three fidelity levels achieves a more accurate

parallel infinite plates at $y=\pm L$ moving relative to each other with
opposite velocities $(\pm \alpha L,0,0)$ along the $x$-direction. Assuming that
the stationary state takes the specific form of $F(y,v_x-\alpha y,v_y,v_z)$
with the $x$-component of the molecular velocity sheared linearly along the
$y$-direction, such steady flow is governed by a boundary value problem on a
steady nonlinear Boltzmann equation driven by an external shear force under the
homogeneous non-moving diffuse reflection boundary condition. In case of the
Maxwell molecule collisions, we establish the existence of spatially
inhomogeneous non-equilibrium stationary solutions to the steady problem for
any small enough shear rate $\alpha>0$ via an elaborate perturbation approach
using Caflisch's decomposition together with Guo's $L^\infty\cap L^2$ theory.
The result indicates the polynomial tail at large velocities for the stationary
distribution. Moreover, the large time asymptotic stability of the stationary
solution with an exponential convergence is also obtained and as a consequence
the nonnegativity of the steady profile is justified.

well-known Voronoi tessellation technique is regularly used for obtaining
microstructures. Standard Voronoi tessellations, however, exhibit statistics
that are generally far removed from those in real microstructures.
Nevertheless, such tessellations can be optimized to obtain certain key
features and statistics seen in real microstructures. In this work, we develop
the open-source software package OptiMic that enables the generation of
optimized microstructures for both finite element as well as atomistic
simulations. OptiMic allows for both monodispersive grains as well as irregular
grains obtained currently via Voronoi tessellations. These initial
microstructures can then be optimized to reflect desired statistical features.
A key feature of the tool is that it gives the user extensive control on the
optimization process via customizable cost functions. The software currently
performs tessellations with the Voronoi method and can be easily extended to
include other methods like grain-growth, phase-field etc.

urban augmented reality (AR). This work tackles the problem of locating
floor-level lines in street-view images, using a supervised deep learning
approach. Unfortunately, very little data is available for training such a
network $-$ current street-view datasets contain either semantic annotations
that lack geometric attributes, or rectified facades without perspective
priors. To address this issue, we first compile a new dataset and develop a new
data augmentation scheme to synthesize training samples by harassing (i) the
rich semantics of existing rectified facades and (ii) perspective priors of
buildings in diverse street views. Next, we design FloorLevel-Net, a multi-task
learning network that associates explicit features of building facades and
implicit floor-level lines, along with a height-attention mechanism to help
enforce a vertical ordering of floor-level lines. The generated segmentations
are then passed to a second-stage geometry post-processing to exploit
self-constrained geometric priors for plausible and consistent reconstruction
of floor-level lines. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations conducted on
assorted facades in existing datasets and street views from Google demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Also, we present context-aware image overlay

Existing task allocation works usually assume all submitted tasks are equally

directly applied in Multi-task Transfer Learning (MTL). To address these
issues, we first reveal that it is crucial to measure the impact of tasks on
overall decision performance improvement and quantify \emph{task importance}.
We then show that task allocation with task importance for MTL (TATIM) is a
variant of the NP-complete Knapsack problem, where the complicated computation
to solve this problem needs to be conducted repeatedly under varying contexts.
To solve TATIM with high computational efficiency, we propose a Data-driven
Cooperative Task Allocation (DCTA) approach. Finally, we evaluate the
performance of DCTA by not only a trace-driven simulation, but also a new
comprehensive real-world AIOps case study that bridges model and practice via a
new architecture and main components design within the AIOps system. Extensive
experiments show that our DCTA reduces 3.24 times of processing time, and saves
48.4\% energy consumption compared with the state-of-the-art when solving

electromagnetic problem to calculating the quantum bound states of the hydrogen
atom. In textbooks, eigenvalue problems are defined for linear problems,
particularly linear differential equations such as time-independent
Schr\""odinger equations. Eigenfunctions of such problems exhibit several
standard features independent of the form of the underlying equations. As
discussed in Bender \emph{et al}
[\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1751-8113/47/23/235204}{J.~Phys.~A 47, 235204

features. In this sense, they can be considered eigenfunctions of nonlinear
differential equations, and the quantized initial conditions that give rise to
the separatrices can be interpreted as eigenvalues. We introduce a first-order
nonlinear eigenvalue problem involving a general class of functions and obtain
the large-eigenvalue limit by reducing it to a random walk problem on a
half-line. The introduced general class of functions covers many special
functions such as the Bessel and Airy functions, which are themselves solutions
of second-order differential equations. For instance, in a special case
involving the Bessel functions of the first kind, i.e., for $y'(x)=J_\nu(xy)$,
we show that the eigenvalues asymptotically grow as $2^{41/42} n^{1/4}$. We
also introduce and discuss nonlinear eigenvalue problems involving the
reciprocal gamma and the Riemann zeta functions, which are not solutions to
simple differential equations. With the reciprocal gamma function, i.e., for
$y'(x)=1/\Gamma(-xy)$, we show that the $n$th eigenvalue grows factorially fast
as $\sqrt{(1-2n)/\Gamma(r_{2n-1})}$, where $r_k$ is the $k$th root of the
digamma function.

impact of imbalanced data on GCN- based linkage prediction task is quite
different, which would cause problems in two aspects: imbalanced linkage labels
and biased graph representations. The former is similar to that in classic
image classification task, but the latter is a particular problem in GCN-based

in training can cause catastrophic over-fitting of a GCN model. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a linkage-based doubly imbalanced graph learning
framework for face clustering. In this framework, we evaluate the feasibility
of those existing methods for imbalanced image classification problem on GCNs,
and present a new method to alleviate the imbalanced labels and also augment
graph representations using a Reverse-Imbalance Weighted Sampling (RIWS)
strategy. With the RIWS strategy, probability-based class balancing weights
could ensure the overall distribution of positive and negative samples; in
addition, weighted random sampling provides diverse subgraph structures, which
effectively alleviates the over-fitting problem and improves the representation

decision maker (DM) facing a lottery, falsely interprets losing outcomes that
are close to winning ones, as a sign that success is within reach. As a result
of this false belief, the DM will prefer lotteries that induce a higher
frequency of near misses, even if the underlying probability of winning is
constant. We define a near miss index that measures the near miss effect
induced by a given lottery and analyze the optimal lottery design in terms of
near miss. This analysis leads us to establish a fruitful connection between
our near miss framework and the field of coding theory. Building on this
connection we compare different lottery frames and the near miss effect they
induce. Analyzing an interaction between a seller and a buyer of lotteries
allows us to gain further insight into the optimal framing of lotteries and
might offer a potential explanation as to why lotteries with a very small
probability of winning are commonplace and attractive.

graphs. In this work we exhibit a correspondence between graph states and the
variety of binary symmetric principal minors, in particular their corresponding
orbits under the action of $SL(2,\mathbb F_2)^{\times n}\rtimes \mathfrak S_n$.
We start by approaching the topic more widely, that is by studying the orbits
of maximal abelian subgroups of the $n$-fold Pauli group under the action of
$\mathcal C_n^{\text{loc}}\rtimes \mathfrak S_n$, where $\mathcal
C_n^{\text{loc}}$ is the $n$-fold local Clifford group: we show that this

crucial step in this correspondence is in translating the action of
$SL(2,\mathbb F_2)^{\times n}$ into an action of the local symplectic group
$Sp_{2n}^{\text{loc}}(\mathbb F_2)$ on the Lagrangian Grassmannian $LG_{\mathbb

leads to a reduction of the domain-wall length at sharp tipped features. These
features appear after the optical switching at positions where the line of
constant threshold fluence in the Gaussian footprint of the laser pulse comes
close to an already-existing domain wall. On the other hand, we identify the
presence of laser-induced domain-wall motion in the toggle-switching event as a
further cause for local deviations from purely deterministic toggle switching.

limited amount of ordinal information. Our primary contribution is threefold.
First, we consider mechanisms which perform a sequence of pairwise comparisons
between candidates. We show that a widely-popular deterministic mechanism
employed in most knockout phases yields distortion $\mathcal{O}(\log m)$ while
eliciting only $m-1$ out of $\Theta(m^2)$ possible pairwise comparisons, where
$m$ represents the number of candidates. Our analysis for this mechanism
leverages a powerful technical lemma recently developed by Kempe
\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/000120a}. We also provide a matching lower bound on its
distortion. In contrast, we prove that any mechanism which performs fewer than
$m-1$ pairwise comparisons is destined to have unbounded distortion. Moreover,
we study the power of deterministic mechanisms under incomplete rankings. Most
notably, when every agent provides her $k$-top preferences we show an upper
bound of $6 m/k + 1$ on the distortion, for any $k \in \{1, 2, \dots, m\}$.
Thus, we substantially improve over the previous bound of $12 m/k$ recently
established by Kempe \cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/000120a,DBLP:conf/aaai/000120b}, and
we come closer to matching the best-known lower bound. Finally, we are
concerned with the sample complexity required to ensure near-optimal distortion
with high probability. Our main contribution is to show that a random sample of
$\Theta(m/\epsilon^2)$ voters suffices to guarantee distortion $3 + \epsilon$
with high probability, for any sufficiently small $\epsilon > 0$. This result
is based on analyzing the sensitivity of the deterministic mechanism introduced
by Gkatzelis, Halpern, and Shah \cite{DBLP:conf/focs/Gkatzelis0020}.
Importantly, all of our sample-complexity bounds are distribution-independent.

the parties are moving with uniform acceleration and the analysis is carried
out using the single mode approximation. Due to acceleration the quantum
coherence is divided into two parts as accessible and inaccessible coherence
and the entire analysis has been carried out in the single-mode approximation.
First we investigate tripartite systems, considering both GHZ and W-states. We
find that the quantum coherence of these states does not vanish in the limit of
infinite acceleration, rather asymptoting to a non-zero value. These results
hold for both single- and two-qubit acceleration. In the GHZ and W-states the
coherence is distributed as correlations between the qubits and is known as
global coherence. But quantum coherence can also exist due to the superposition
within a qubit, the local coherence. To study the properties of local coherence
we investigate separable state. The GHZ state, W-state and separable states
contain only one type of coherence. Next we consider the $W \bar{W}$ and star
states in which both local and global coherences coexist. We find that under
uniform acceleration both local and global coherence show similar qualitative
behaviour. Finally we derive analytic expressions for the quantum coherence of
N-partite GHZ and W-states for n < N accelerating qubits. We find that the
quantum coherence of a multipartite GHZ state falls exponentially with the
number of accelerated qubits, whereas for multipartite W-states the quantum
coherence decreases only polynomially. We conclude that W-states are more
robust to Unruh decoherence and discuss some potential applications in
satellite-based quantum communication and black hole physics.

We use a 15 pointing radio continuum L-band mosaic of the Lockman Hole,
observed in full polarisation, generated from archival data of the WSRT. The
data were analysed using the RM-Synthesis technique. We achieved a noise of 7
{\mu}Jy/beam in polarised intensity, with a resolution of 15''. Using infrared
and optical images and source catalogues, we were able to cross-identify and
determine redshifts for one third of our detected polarised sources. We
detected 150 polarised sources, most of which are weakly polarised with a mean
fractional polarisation of 5.4 %. With a total area of 6.5 deg^2 and a
detection threshold of 6.25 {\sigma} we find 23 polarised sources per deg^2.
Based on our multi wavelength analysis, we find that our sample consists of AGN
only. We find a discrepancy between archival number counts and those present in
our data, which we attribute to sample variance. Considering the absolute radio
luminosty, to distinguish weak and strong sources, we find a general trend of
increased probability to detect weak sources at low redshift and strong sources
at high redshift. Further, we find an anti-correlation between fractional
polarisation and redshift for our strong sources sample at z{\geq}0.6. A
decrease in the fractional polarisation of strong sources with increasing
redshift cannot be explained by a constant magnetic field and electron density
over cosmic scales, however the changing properties of cluster environments
over the cosmic timemay play an important role. Disentangling these two effects
requires deeper and wider polarisation observations, and better models of the

autonomous driving, performing 3D object detection on monocular images becomes
an important task for visual scene understanding. Recent advances on monocular
3D object detection mainly rely on the ``pseudo-LiDAR'' generation, which
performs monocular depth estimation and lifts the 2D pixels to pseudo 3D
points. However, depth estimation from monocular images, due to its poor
accuracy, leads to inevitable position shift of pseudo-LiDAR points within the
object. Therefore, the predicted bounding boxes may suffer from inaccurate
location and deformed shape. In this paper, we present a novel neighbor-voting
method that incorporates neighbor predictions to ameliorate object detection
from severely deformed pseudo-LiDAR point clouds. Specifically, each feature
point around the object forms their own predictions, and then the ``consensus''
is achieved through voting. In this way, we can effectively combine the
neighbors' predictions with local prediction and achieve more accurate 3D
detection. To further enlarge the difference between the foreground region of
interest (ROI) pseudo-LiDAR points and the background points, we also encode
the ROI prediction scores of 2D foreground pixels into the corresponding
pseudo-LiDAR points. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark to
validate the merits of our proposed method. Our results on the bird's eye view
detection outperform the state-of-the-art performance by a large margin,
especially for the ``hard'' level detection.

translated image realistic and retain as much information from the source
domain as possible. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture,
termed as IEGAN, which removes the encoder of each network and introduces an
encoder that is independent of other networks. Compared with previous models,
it embodies three advantages of our model: Firstly, it is more directly and
comprehensively to grasp image information since the encoder no longer receives
loss from generator and discriminator. Secondly, the independent encoder allows
each network to focus more on its own goal which makes the translated image
more realistic. Thirdly, the reduction in the number of encoders performs more
unified image representation. However, when the independent encoder applies two
down-sampling blocks, it's hard to extract semantic information. To tackle this
problem, we propose deep and shallow information space containing
characteristic and semantic information, which can guide the model to translate
high-quality images under the task with significant shape or texture change. We
compare IEGAN with other previous models, and conduct researches on semantic
information consistency and component ablation at the same time. These

SSL, which learns a probabilistic model of the inputs, or contrastive SSL where
we design a supervised learning task to encourage good representations. We
reconcile these approaches by showing that contrastive SSL methods (including
InfoNCE) which maximize the mutual information (MI) implicitly learn a
probabilistic model of the inputs (specifically, a variational autoencoder;
VAE). In particular, when we learn the optimal prior, the VAE objective (the
ELBO) becomes equal to the MI (up to a constant). In turn, for a deterministic
encoder the ELBO is equal to the log Bayesian model evidence. This establishes
a profound connection between Bayesian inference and information theory.
However, practical InfoNCE methods do not use the MI as an objective: the MI is
invariant to arbitrary invertible transformations, so using an MI objective can
lead to highly entangled representations (Tschannen et al., 2019). Instead, the
actual InfoNCE objective is a simplified lower bound on the MI which is loose
even in the infinite sample limit. Thus, an objective that works (i.e. the
actual InfoNCE objective) appears to be motivated as a loose bound on an
objective that does not work (i.e. the true MI which gives arbitrarily
entangled representations). We give an alternative motivation for the actual
InfoNCE objective. In particular, we show that in the infinite sample limit,

by dynamically re-configuring routing policies to better distribute on-going
large data transfers. Unfortunately, the information necessary to decide on an
appropriate reconfiguration - details of on-going and upcoming data transfers
such as their source and destination and, most importantly, their volume and

transfer services, such as FTS, makes it possible to collect the necessary

transfers is not sufficient to predict with confidence the likelihood a network

Following ideas from Morse theory, we define modes as paths invariant under
optimization of a cost functional. We develop a multi-mode estimation algorithm

whose index can be evaluated by quantifying its expression in Ki67
immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images. However, quantitative analysis on
multi-source Ki67 images is yet a challenging task in practice due to
cross-domain distribution differences, which result from imaging variation,
staining styles, and lesion types. Many recent studies have made some efforts
on domain generalization (DG), whereas there are still some noteworthy
limitations. Specifically in the case of Ki67 images, learning invariant
representation is at the mercy of the insufficient number of domains and the
cell categories mismatching in different domains. In this paper, we propose a
novel method to improve DG by searching the domain-agnostic subnetwork in a
domain merging scenario. Partial model parameters are iteratively pruned
according to the domain gap, which is caused by the data converting from a
single domain into merged domains during training. In addition, the model is
optimized by fine-tuning on merged domains to eliminate the interference of
class mismatching among various domains. Furthermore, an appropriate
implementation is attained by applying the pruning method to different parts of
the framework. Compared with known DG methods, our method yields excellent
performance in multiclass nucleus recognition of Ki67 IHC images, especially in
the lost category cases. Moreover, our competitive results are also evaluated
on the public dataset over the state-of-the-art DG methods.

is recommended. Routinary examinations result in datasets with a predominant
amount of negative samples. A potential solution to such class-imbalance is
joining forces across multiple institutions. Developing a collaborative
computer-aided diagnosis system is challenging in different ways. Patient
privacy and regulations need to be carefully respected. Data across
institutions may be acquired from different devices or imaging protocols,
leading to heterogeneous non-IID data. Also, for learning-based methods, new
optimization strategies working on distributed data are required. Recently,
federated learning has emerged as an effective tool for collaborative learning.
In this setting, local models perform computation on their private data to
update the global model. The order and the frequency of local updates influence
the final global model. Hence, the order in which samples are locally presented
to the optimizers plays an important role. In this work, we define a
memory-aware curriculum learning method for the federated setting. Our
curriculum controls the order of the training samples paying special attention
to those that are forgotten after the deployment of the global model. Our
approach is combined with unsupervised domain adaptation to deal with domain
shift while preserving data privacy. We evaluate our method with three clinical
datasets from different vendors. Our results verify the effectiveness of
federated adversarial learning for the multi-site breast cancer classification.
Moreover, we show that our proposed memory-aware curriculum method is
beneficial to further improve classification performance. Our code is publicly

correlation length in a model with long range interactions whose correlation
functions away from a critical point have power-law tails instead of the usual
exponential decay. It turns out that quasiparticle spectrum depends on a
distance from the critical point in a way that allows to identify the standard
correlation length exponent, $\nu$. The exponent implicitly defines a
correlation length $\xi$ that diverges when the critical point is approached.
We show that the correlation length manifests itself also in the correlation
function but not in its exponential tail because there is none. Instead $\xi$
is a distance that marks a crossover between two different algebraic decays
with different exponents. At distances shorter than $\xi$ the correlator decays
with the same power law as at the critical point while at distances longer than
$\xi$ it decays faster, with a steeper power law. For this correlator it is
possible to formulate the usual scaling hypothesis with $\xi$ playing the role
of the scaling distance. The correlation length also leaves its mark on the
subleading anomalous fermionic correlator but, interestingly, there is a regime
of long range interactions where its short distance critical power-law decay is
steeper than its long distance power law tail.

the strategic choices of a coalition of agents in a multi-agent system. We
introduce HyperATL*, an extension of computation tree logic with path variables
and strategy quantifiers. HyperATL* can express strategic hyperproperties, such
as that the scheduler in a concurrent system has a strategy to avoid

hyperproperties, i.e., hyperproperties where the speed of the execution on the
different computation paths depends on the choices of the scheduler. Unlike
other recent logics for the specification of asynchronous hyperproperties, our
logic is the first to admit decidable model checking for the full logic. We
present a model checking algorithm for HyperATL* based on alternating word

satisfy the cluster contiguity constraint with respect to the graph. We design
an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that delivers full Bayesian

lithium, beryllium, and boron -- represents one of the most interesting open
problems in astrophysics. As well known, several measurements of 7-Li
abundances in stellar atmospheres point out a disagreement between predictions
and observations in different stellar evolutionary phases, rising doubts about
the capability of present stellar models to precisely reproduce stellar
envelope characteristics. Light elements are burned at relatively low
temperatures (from 2 to 5 MK) and thus in the evolutionary stages of a star
they are gradually destroyed at different depths of stellar interior, in
dependence on the stellar mass. Their surface abundances are strongly
influenced by the nuclear cross sections, by the extension of the convective
envelope and by the temperature at its bottom, which depend on the
characteristics of the star (mass and chemical composition) as well as on the
energy transport in the convective stellar envelope. In recent years, a great
effort has been made to improve the precision of light element burning cross
sections. However, theoretical predictions surface light element abundance are
challenging because they are also influenced by the uncertainties in the input
physics adopted in the calculations as well as the efficiency of several
standard and non-standard physical processes active in young stars (i.e.
diffusion, radiative levitation, magnetic fields, rotation). Moreover, it is
still not completely clear how much the previous protostellar evolution affects
the characteristics of a stellar model and thus the light element depletion.
This paper presents the state-of-the-art of theoretical predictions for
protostars and PMS stars, discussing the role of several input physics on the
stellar evolution.

to the need of synthesizing tabular data -- the most widely used data format.
While synthetic tabular data offers the advantage of complying with privacy
regulations, there still exists a risk of privacy leakage via inference attacks
due to interpolating the properties of real data during training. Differential
private (DP) training algorithms provide theoretical guarantees for training
machine learning models by injecting statistical noise to prevent privacy
leaks. However, the challenges of applying DP on TGAN are to determine the most
optimal framework (i.e., PATE/DP-SGD) and neural network (i.e.,
Generator/Discriminator)to inject noise such that the data utility is well
maintained under a given privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose DTGAN, a
novel conditional Wasserstein tabular GAN that comes in two variants DTGAN_G
and DTGAN_D, for providing a detailed comparison of tabular GANs trained using
DP-SGD for the generator vs discriminator, respectively. We elicit the privacy
analysis associated with training the generator with complex loss functions
(i.e., classification and information losses) needed for high quality tabular
data synthesis. Additionally, we rigorously evaluate the theoretical privacy
guarantees offered by DP empirically against membership and attribute inference
attacks. Our results on 3 datasets show that the DP-SGD framework is superior
to PATE and that a DP discriminator is more optimal for training convergence.
Thus, we find (i) DTGAN_D is capable of maintaining the highest data utility
across 4 ML models by up to 18% in terms of the average precision score for a
strict privacy budget, epsilon = 1, as compared to the prior studies and (ii)
DP effectively prevents privacy loss against inference attacks by restricting
the success probability of membership attacks to be close to 50%.

robust deep features but demonstrate unsatisfying performance in the scenes

simultaneously by designing a contextual correlation layer (CCL). The CCL can
efficiently capture the long-range correlation within feature maps and can be
flexibly used in a learning framework. In addition, considering that a single
homography can not represent the complex spatial transformation in
depth-varying images with parallax, we propose to predict multi-grid homography
from global to local. Moreover, we equip our network with a depth perception

Score (MOS) tests, where listeners score samples of synthetic speech on a
Likert scale. A major drawback of MOS tests is that they only offer a general
measure of overall quality-i.e., the naturalness of an utterance-and so cannot
tell us where exactly synthesis errors occur. This can make evaluation of the
appropriateness of prosodic variation within utterances inconclusive. To
address this, we propose a novel evaluation method based on the Rapid Prosody
Transcription paradigm. This allows listeners to mark the locations of errors
in an utterance in real-time, providing a probabilistic representation of the
perceptual errors that occur in the synthetic signal. We conduct experiments
that confirm that the fine-grained evaluation can be mapped to system rankings
of standard MOS tests, but the error marking gives a much more comprehensive
assessment of synthesized prosody. In particular, for standard audiobook test
set samples, we see that error marks consistently cluster around words at major
prosodic boundaries indicated by punctuation. However, for question-answer
based stimuli, where we control information structure, we see differences
emerge in the ability of neural TTS systems to generate context-appropriate
prosodic prominence.

fine-tunes a well-trained reading-style TTS model for spontaneous-style speech.
Specifically, 1) to insert filled pauses (FP) in the text sequence
appropriately, we introduce an FP predictor to the TTS model; 2) to model the
varying rhythms, we introduce a duration predictor based on mixture of experts
(MoE), which contains three experts responsible for the generation of fast,
medium and slow speech respectively, and fine-tune it as well as the pitch
predictor for rhythm adaptation; 3) to adapt to other speaker timbre, we
fine-tune some parameters in the decoder with few speech data. To address the
challenge of lack of training data, we mine a spontaneous speech dataset to
support our research this work and facilitate future research on spontaneous

dissociation, double dissociation). The soft rapidity gap survival factor for
the case of single proton measurement is significantly smaller than that for
the inclusive case (no proton measurement). We find only weak dependence on the
invariant mass of the dilepton system as well as the lepton pair transverse
momentum and sizeable dependence on the pair rapidity. The latter effect is
rather difficult to identify experimentally.

to map the graphs onto the system's processing elements (PEs). This task
becomes all the more important when PEs have non-uniform communication costs or
the input is highly irregular. Typically, mapping is addressed using
partitioning, in a two-step approach or an integrated one. Parallel
partitioning tools do exist; yet, corresponding mapping algorithms or their
public implementations all have major sequential parts or other severe scaling
limitations. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm that maps graphs
onto the PEs of a hierarchical system. Our solution integrates partitioning and
mapping; it models the system hierarchy in a concise way as an implicit labeled
tree. The vertices of the application graph are labeled as well, and these
vertex labels induce the mapping. The mapping optimization follows the basic
idea of parallel label propagation, but we tailor the gain computations of
label changes to quickly account for the induced communication costs. Our
MPI-based code is the first public implementation of a parallel graph mapping
algorithm; to this end, we extend the partitioning library ParHIP. To evaluate
our algorithm's implementation, we perform comparative experiments with complex
networks in the million- and billion-scale range. In general our mapping tool
shows good scalability on up to a few thousand PEs. Compared to other MPI-based
competitors, our algorithm achieves the best speed to quality trade-off and our
quality results are even better than non-parallel mapping tools.

Their nature is puzzling due to their charge, which forces its minimal quark
content to be $b\bar b u\bar d$ ($b\bar b d\bar u$). Thus, it is necessary to
explore four-quark systems in order to understand their inner structure.
Additionally, their strong coupling to channels such as $\pi \Upsilon$ and the
closeness of their mass to $B^\ast\bar B^{(\ast)}$-thresholds stimulates a
molecular interpretation. Within the framework of a constituent quark model
which satisfactorily describes a wide range of properties of (non-)conventional
hadrons containing heavy quarks, we perform a coupled-channels calculation of
the $I^G(J^{PC})=1^+(1^{+-})$ hidden-bottom sector including $B^{(\ast)}\bar
B^{\ast}+h.c.$, $\pi h_b$, $\pi \Upsilon$ and $\rho\eta_b$ channels. We analyze
the line shapes in the different channels, describing the $\Upsilon(5S)\to \pi

the line shapes promising, we perform the same coupled-channels calculation for
the $Z_b$'s with $J^{--}$, where $J=\{0,1,2\}$. This allows us to obtain a fair
description of the corresponding line shapes. The study of the analytic
structure of the $S$-matrix suggests that the experimental $Z_b$ structures

ability to account for numerical ES splittings solely within the context of
conformal field theory (CFT) is an additional diagnostic of the underlying
topological theory, of finer sensitivity than ""state-counting"". We use the
conformal boundary state description of the ES, which can be viewed as a
quantum quench. In this language, the ES splittings arise from local
conservation laws in the chiral CFT besides the energy, which we view as a
Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE). Global SU(2) symmetry imposes strong
constraints on the number of such conservation laws, so that only a small
number of parameters can be responsible for the splittings. We work out these
conservation laws for chiral SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Witten CFTs at levels one and
two, and for the latter we notably find that some of the conservation laws take
the form of local integrals of operators of fractional dimension, as proposed
by Cardy for quantum quenches. We analyze numerical ES from systems with SU(2)
symmetry including chiral spin-liquid ground states of local 2D Hamiltonians
and two chiral Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) tensor networks, which
exhibit the ""state-counting"" of the SU(2)-level-one and -level-two theories. We
find that the low-lying ES splittings can be well understood by the lowest of
our conservation laws, and we demonstrate the importance of accounting for the
fractional conservation laws at level two. Thus the states we consider,
including the PEPS, appear chiral also under our more sensitive diagnostic.

recognition with geometric or photometric variations typically involve
deformable convolution that convolves on arbitrary locations of input features.
The locations change with different inputs and induce considerable dynamic and
irregular memory accesses which cannot be handled by classic neural network
accelerators (NNAs). Moreover, bilinear interpolation (BLI) operation that is
required to obtain deformed features in DCNs also cannot be deployed on
existing NNAs directly. Although a general purposed processor (GPP) seated
along with classic NNAs can process the deformable convolution, the processing
on GPP can be extremely slow due to the lack of parallel computing capability.
  To address the problem, we develop a DCN accelerator on existing NNAs to
support both the standard convolution and deformable convolution. Specifically,
for the dynamic and irregular accesses in DCNs, we have both the input and
output features divided into tiles and build a tile dependency table (TDT) to
track the irregular tile dependency at runtime. With the TDT, we further
develop an on-chip tile scheduler to handle the dynamic and irregular accesses

an earthquake's faulting mechanism. This inverse problem requires a numerical
forward model that is both accurate and fast, as typical inverse procedures
require many evaluations. The Weakly-enforced Slip Method (WSM) was developed
to meet these needs, but it was not before applied in an inverse problem
setting. Consequently, it was unknown what effect particular properties of the
WSM, notably its inherent continuity, have on the inversion process. Here we
show that the WSM is able to accurately recover slip distributions in a
Bayesian-inference setting, provided that data points in the vicinity of the
fault are removed. In a representative scenario, an element size of 2 km was
found to be sufficiently fine to generate a posterior probability distribution
that is close to the theoretical optimum. For rupturing faults a masking zone
of 20 km sufficed to avoid numerical disturbances that would otherwise be
induced by the discretization error. These results demonstrate that the WSM is
a viable forward method for earthquake inversion problems. While our
synthesized scenario is basic for reasons of validation, our results are
expected to generalize to the wider gamut of scenarios that finite element
methods are able to capture. This has the potential to bring modeling
flexibility to a field that if often forced to impose model restrictions in a

lens of kernelization, which is a framework of polynomial-time preprocessing
aimed at compressing the instance size. Our main focus is the weighted Clique
problem, where we are given an edge-weighted graph and the goal is to detect a
clique of total weight equal to a prescribed value. We show that the weighted
variant, parameterized by the number of vertices $n$, is significantly harder
than the unweighted problem by presenting an $O(n^{3 - \varepsilon})$ lower
bound on the size of the kernel, under the assumption that NP $\not \subseteq$
coNP/poly. This lower bound is essentially tight: we show that we can reduce
the problem to the case with weights bounded by $2^{O(n)}$, which yields a
randomized kernel of $O(n^3)$ bits.
  We generalize these results to the weighted $d$-Uniform Hyperclique problem,
Subset Sum, and weighted variants of Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(CSPs). We also study weighted minimization problems and show that weight
compression is easier when we only want to preserve the collection of optimal
solutions. Namely, we show that for node-weighted Vertex Cover on bipartite
graphs it is possible to maintain the set of optimal solutions using integer
weights from the range $[1, n]$, but if we want to maintain the ordering of the
weights of all inclusion-minimal solutions, then weights as large as
$2^{\Omega(n)}$ are necessary.

outputs generally deviates from the distribution of the signals it attempts to
estimate. This phenomenon, known as the perception-distortion tradeoff, has
captured significant attention in image restoration, where it implies that
fidelity to ground truth images comes at the expense of perceptual quality
(deviation from statistics of natural images). However, despite the increasing
popularity of performing comparisons on the perception-distortion plane, there
remains an important open question: what is the minimal distortion that can be
achieved under a given perception constraint? In this paper, we derive a closed
form expression for this distortion-perception (DP) function for the mean
squared-error (MSE) distortion and the Wasserstein-2 perception index. We prove
that the DP function is always quadratic, regardless of the underlying
distribution. This stems from the fact that estimators on the DP curve form a
geodesic in Wasserstein space. In the Gaussian setting, we further provide a
closed form expression for such estimators. For general distributions, we show
how these estimators can be constructed from the estimators at the two extremes
of the tradeoff: The global MSE minimizer, and a minimizer of the MSE under a
perfect perceptual quality constraint. The latter can be obtained as a
stochastic transformation of the former.

navigation and autonomous driving. The use of cameras for localization with
high definition map (HD Map) provides an affordable localization sensor set.
Existing methods suffer from pose estimation failure due to error prone data
association or initialization with accurate initial pose requirement. In this
paper, we propose a cost-effective vehicle localization system with HD map for
autonomous driving that uses cameras as primary sensors. To this end, we
formulate vision-based localization as a data association problem that maps
visual semantics to landmarks in HD map. Specifically, system initialization is
finished in a coarse to fine manner by combining coarse GPS (Global Positioning
System) measurement and fine pose searching. In tracking stage, vehicle pose is
refined by implicitly aligning the semantic segmentation result between image
and landmarks in HD maps with photometric consistency. Finally, vehicle pose is
computed by pose graph optimization in a sliding window fashion. We evaluate
our method on two datasets and demonstrate that the proposed approach yields
promising localization results in different driving scenarios. Additionally,
our approach is suitable for both monocular camera and multi-cameras that
provides flexibility and improves robustness for the localization system.

the nuclear surface. In particular, the nuclear surface diffuseness parameter
is correlated with the occupation probability of nucleons indistinct nuclear
orbits, especially those with low angular momenta. The aim of this paper is to
investigate the relationship between the nuclear surface diffuseness and
spectroscopic information of neutron rich Ne and Mg isotopes both at the cusp
and inside the island of inversion. We use the microscopic antisymmetrized
molecular dynamics model to calculate these densities and other spectroscopic
information. A two-parameter Fermi density distribution is then used to define
the diffuseness parameter. To relate them with observables, the nucleon-nucleus
elastic scattering differential cross section is calculated with the demand
that they reproduce the first peak position and its magnitude. A marked
increase in the occupation of neutrons in the pf-orbit is noted in Ne and Mg
isotopes from N=19 onwards. We observed that the nuclear diffuseness is
strongly correlated with the nuclear deformation, in the island of inversion,
and gradually increases with the occupation of neutrons in the 1p3/2 orbit.
This result is also confirmed by a single-particle estimate of the valence
neutron density distribution. An exception is noted for 35-37Mg, where the
filling up of the holes in the sd-shell partially compensates the increase in
diffuseness due to filling up of the 1p3/2 orbit. Information on nuclear
density profile of neutron rich medium mass nuclei can be reliably extracted by
studying the first diffraction peak of the nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering
differential cross section. The enormous surface diffuseness of Ne and Mg
isotopes, in the island of inversion, could be attributed to the increasing
neutron occupation of the 1p3/2 orbit.

and deletion of key-value pairs, as well as the recovery of all key-value pairs
that have been inserted, as long as the number of key-value pairs stored in the
IBLT does not exceed a certain number. The recovery operation on an IBLT can be
represented as a peeling process on a bipartite graph. We present a density
evolution analysis of IBLTs which allows to predict the maximum number of
key-value pairs that can be inserted in the table so that recovery is still
successful with high probability. This analysis holds for arbitrary irregular
degree distributions and generalizes results in the literature. We complement
our analysis by numerical simulations of our own IBLT design which allows to
recover a larger number of key-value pairs as state-of-the-art IBLTs of same
size.

QCD. We employ gauge configurations with two degenerate light, a strange and a
charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$) of maximally twisted mass fermions with a clover
improvement. The lattice has a spatial extent of 3 fm and lattice spacing of
0.093 fm. The values of the quark masses lead to a pion mass of $260$ MeV. We
use a source-sink time separation of 1.12 fm to control contamination from
excited states. Our calculation is based on the quasi-distribution approach,
with three values for the proton momentum: 0.83 GeV, 1.25 GeV, and 1.67 GeV.
The lattice data are renormalized non-perturbatively using the RI$'$ scheme,
and the final result for $h_L(x)$ is presented in the $\overline{\rm MS}$
scheme at the scale of 2 GeV. Furthermore, we compute in the same setup the
transversity distribution, $h_1(x)$, which allows us, in particular, to compare
$h_L(x)$ to its Wandzura-Wilczek approximation. We also combine results for the
isovector and isoscalar flavor combinations to disentangle the individual quark
contributions for $h_1(x)$ and $h_L(x)$, and address the Wandzura-Wilczek

using contrastive losses. A traditional approach is to contrast different
modalities to learn the information shared between them. However, that approach
could fail to learn the complementary synergies between modalities that might
be useful for downstream tasks. Another approach is to concatenate all the
modalities into a tuple and then contrast positive and negative tuple
correspondences. However, that approach could consider only the stronger
modalities while ignoring the weaker ones. To address these issues, we propose
a novel contrastive learning objective, TupleInfoNCE. It contrasts tuples based
not only on positive and negative correspondences but also by composing new
negative tuples using modalities describing different scenes. Training with
these additional negatives encourages the learning model to examine the
correspondences among modalities in the same tuple, ensuring that weak
modalities are not ignored. We provide a theoretical justification based on
mutual information for why this approach works, and we propose a sample
optimization algorithm to generate positive and negative samples to maximize
training efficacy. We find that TupleInfoNCE significantly outperforms the
previous state of the arts on three different downstream tasks.

difference between the two models concerning SOC is that in the one-band case
the SOC is a purely non-local term in the basis of the $p_z$ orbitals, whereas
in the two-band case with $p_x$ and $p_y$ as basis functions it is purely
local. In order to grasp the correlation effects on non-local spin-orbit
coupling, we apply the TRILEX approach that allows to calculate non-local
contributions to the self-energy approximatively. For the two-band case we
apply dynamical mean-field theory. In agreement with previous studies, we find
that for all parameter values in our study, the effect of correlations on the
spin-orbit coupling strength is that the bare effective SOC parameter is
increased. However, this increase is much weaker in the non-local than in the
local SOC case. Concerning the TRILEX method, we introduce the necessary
formulas for calculations with broken SU(2) symmetry.

Gavinsky et. al. [STOC'07], has played an important role in the streaming lower
bounds for graph problems such as triangle and subgraph counting, maximum
matching, MAX-CUT, Schatten $p$-norm approximation, maximum acyclic subgraph,
testing bipartiteness, $k$-connectivity, and cycle-freeness. The one-way
communication complexity of the Boolean Hidden Matching problem on a universe
of size $n$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, resulting in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bounds
for constant factor approximations to several of the aforementioned graph
problems. The related (and, in fact, more general) Boolean Hidden Hypermatching
(BHH) problem introduced by Verbin and Yu [SODA'11] provides an approach to
proving higher lower bounds of $\Omega(n^{1-1/t})$ for integer $t\geq 2$.
Reductions based on Boolean Hidden Hypermatching generate distributions on
graphs with connected components of diameter about $t$, and basically show that
long range exploration is hard in the streaming model of computation with
adversarial arrivals.
  In this paper we introduce a natural variant of the BHM problem, called noisy
BHM (and its natural noisy BHH variant), that we use to obtain higher than
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bounds for approximating several of the aforementioned
problems in graph streams when the input graphs consist only of components of
diameter bounded by a fixed constant. We also use the noisy BHM problem to show
that the problem of classifying whether an underlying graph is isomorphic to a
complete binary tree in insertion-only streams requires $\Omega(n)$ space,
which seems challenging to show using BHM or BHH alone.

show distinct radiation characteristics compared to the surrounding coronal
plasma. They are associated with coronal sheared and twisted magnetic field
lines. However, the exact magnetic configuration supporting a filament material
is not easy to be ascertained because of the absence of routine observations of
the magnetic field inside filaments. Since many filaments lie above weak-field
regions, it is nearly impossible to extrapolate their coronal magnetic
structures by applying the traditional methods to noisy photospheric
magnetograms, in particular the horizontal components. In this paper, we
construct magnetic structures for some filaments with the regularized
Biot--Savart laws and calculate their magnetic twists. Moreover, we make a
parameter survey for the flux ropes of the Titov-Demoulin-modified model to
explore the factors affecting the twist of a force-free magnetic flux rope. It
is found that the twist of a force-free flux rope is proportional to its axial
length to minor radius ratio, and is basically independent of the overlying
background magnetic field strength. Thus, we infer that long quiescent
filaments are likely to be supported by more twisted flux ropes than short
active-region filaments, which is consistent with observations.

$(1/\sqrt{2\chi})$-approximation algorithm for the $2$-stage restriction of an
MSP if the similarity of subsequent solutions is measured as the intersection
cardinality and said MSP is preficient, i.e., we can efficiently find a
single-stage solution that prefers some given subset. The approximation factor
is dependent on the instance's intertwinement $\chi$, a similarity measure for
multistage graphs. We also show that for any MSP, independent of similarity

down to computing linear recurrence relations of a sequence with the

interpolation and multidimensional cyclic code decoding require guessing linear
recurrence relations of a multivariate sequence.Several algorithms solve this
problem. The so-called Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm (1988) uses polynomial
additions and shifts by a monomial. The Scalar-FGLM algorithm (2015) relies on
linear algebra operations on a multi-Hankel matrix, a multivariate
generalization of a Hankel matrix. The Artinian Gorenstein border basis
algorithm (2017) uses a Gram-Schmidt process.We propose a new algorithm for
computing the Gr{\""o}bner basis of the ideal of relations of a sequence based
solely on multivariate polynomial arithmetic. This algorithm allows us to both
revisit the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm through the use of polynomial
divisions and to completely revise the Scalar-FGLM algorithm without linear

on the mirror of the truncated generating series allowing us to use polynomial
arithmetic modulo a monomial ideal. It appears to have some similarities with
Pad{\'e} approximants of this mirror polynomial.As an addition from the paper

partial-to-partial registration into partial-to-complete registration.
Specifically, we propose a context-guided module which uses an encoder to
extract global features for predicting point overlap score. To better find
representative overlapping points, we use the extracted global features for
coarse alignment. Then, we introduce a Transformer to enrich point features and
remove non-representative points based on point overlap score and feature
matching. A similarity matrix is built in a partial-to-complete mode, and
finally, weighted SVD is adopted to estimate a transformation matrix. Extensive
experiments over ModelNet40 using noisy and partially overlapping point clouds

differential-phase-shift (RRDPS) protocol has a unique feature that its
security is guaranteed without monitoring any statistics. Moreover, this
protocol has a remarkable property of being robust against source imperfections
assuming that the emitted pulses are independent. Unfortunately, some
experiments confirmed the violation of the independence due to pulse
correlations, and therefore the lack of a security proof without taking into
account this effect is an obstacle for the security. In this paper, we prove
that the RRDPS protocol is secure against any source imperfections by
establishing a proof with the pulse correlations. Our proof is simple in the
sense that we make only three experimentally simple assumptions for the source.
Our numerical simulation based on the proof shows that the long-range pulse
correlation does not cause a significant impact on the key rate, which reveals
another striking feature of the RRDPS protocol. Our security proof is thus
effective and applicable to wide range of practical sources and paves the way
to realize truly secure QKD in high-speed systems.

evolutionary predictions, SPINNER identifies more stable phases in the majority
of cases. By developing a reliable and fast structure-prediction framework,
this work opens the door to large-scale, unbounded computational exploration of

of physical systems that can be well described by models with quadratic
nonlinear terms and proposes a regularizer for operator inference that induces
a stability bias onto quadratic models. The proposed regularizer is physics
informed in the sense that it penalizes quadratic terms with large norms and so
explicitly leverages the quadratic model form that is given by the underlying
physics. This means that the proposed approach judiciously learns from data and
physical insights combined, rather than from either data or physics alone.
Additionally, a formulation of operator inference is proposed that enforces
model constraints for preserving structure such as symmetry and definiteness in
the linear terms. Numerical results demonstrate that models learned with
operator inference and the proposed regularizer and structure preservation are
accurate and stable even in cases where using no regularization or Tikhonov
regularization leads to models that are unstable.

Conversely, the organization of rigid, microtubule-like polymers evidences a
progressive breakdown of continuum elasticity theory as chain dimensions become
comparable to the equilibrium radius of the encapsulating membrane. In this

formulate the instance segmentation problem as graph partitioning and the actor
critic predicts the edge weights driven by the rewards, which are based on the
conformity of segmented instances to high-level priors on object shape,

Fahrbach, Huang, Tao, and Zadimoghaddam to solve the edge-weighted online
bipartite matching problem, it is an interesting technique on its own due to
its capability of introducing a powerful algorithmic tool, namely negative
correlation, to online algorithms. As such, Fahrbach et al. posed two
tantalizing open questions in their paper, one of which was the following: Can
we obtain n-way OCS for n>2, in which the algorithm can be given n>2 elements

  In this paper, we affirmatively answer this open question by presenting a
three-way OCS. Our algorithm uses two-way OCS as its building block and is
simple to describe; however, as it internally runs two instances of two-way
OCS, one of which is fed with the output of the other, the final output
probability distribution becomes highly elusive. We tackle this difficulty by
approximating the output distribution of OCS by a flat, less correlated
function and using it as a safe ""surrogate"" of the real distribution. Our
three-way OCS also yields a 0.5093-competitive algorithm for edge-weighted
online matching, demonstrating its usefulness.

the control over the effect of noise. Considering the rapid growth of available
quantum resources that are not fully fault-tolerant, it is crucial to develop
practical hardware-friendly quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques to
suppress unwanted errors. Here, we propose a novel generalized quantum subspace
expansion method which can handle stochastic, coherent, and algorithmic errors
in quantum computers. By fully exploiting the substantially extended subspace,
we can efficiently mitigate the noise present in the spectra of a given
Hamiltonian, without relying on any information of noise. The performance of
our method is discussed under two highly practical setups: the quantum
subspaces are mainly spanned by powers of the noisy state $\rho^m$ and a set of
error-boosted states, respectively. We numerically demonstrate in both
situations that we can suppress errors by orders of magnitude, and show that
out protocol inherits the advantages of previous error-agnostic QEM techniques

particle beams in linear approximation. Starting with a discussion of the most
important types of magnets and defining their multipole strengths, the
linearized equations of motion of charged particles in static magnetic fields
are derived using an orthogonal reference frame following the design orbit.
Analytical solutions are determined for linear elements of a typical beam
transfer line (drift, dipole and quadrupole magnets), and stepwise combined by
introducing the matrix formalism in which each element's contribution is
represented by a single transfer matrix. Application of this formalism allows
to calculate single particle's trajectories in linear approximation. After
introducing the beam emittance as the area occupied by a particle beam in phase
space, a linear treatment of transverse beam dynamics based on appropriately
defined optical functions is introduced. The formalism is applied to the
concepts of both weak and strong focusing, in particular discussing the
properties of the widely-used FODO cell. Specific characteristics of transverse
beam dynamics in periodic systems like circular accelerators are studied in
detail, emphazising the effects of linear field errors on orbit stability and
introducing the phenomena of optical resonances. Finally, the dynamics of
off-momentum particles is presented, introducing dispersion functions and
explaining effects like chromaticity.

Compared to sequential tunnelling, resonant tunnelling dominants water chain

analyzing multi-response data which has garnered considerable popularity in
recent years, for example, in the analysis of multivariate abundance data in
ecology. One of the main features of GLLVMs is their capacity to handle a
variety of responses types, such as (overdispersed) counts, binomial responses,
(semi-)continuous, and proportions data. On the other hand, the introduction of
underlying latent variables presents some major computational challenges, as
the resulting marginal likelihood function involves an intractable integral for
non-normally distributed responses. This has spurred research into
approximation methods to overcome this integral, with a recent and particularly
computationally scalable one being that of variational approximations (VA).
However, research into the use of VA of GLLVMs and related models has been
hampered by the fact that closed-form approximations have only been obtained
for certain pairs of response distributions and link functions.
  In this article, we propose an extended variational approximations (EVA)
approach which widens the set of VA-applicable GLLVMs drastically. EVA draws
inspiration from the underlying idea of Laplace approximations: by replacing
the complete-data likelihood function with its second order Taylor
approximation about the mean of the variational distribution, we can obtain a
closed-form approximation to the marginal likelihood of the GLLVM for any
response type and link function. Through simulation studies and an application
to testate amoebae data set in ecology, we demonstrate how EVA results in a
universal approach to fitting GLLVMs, which remains competitive in terms of
estimation and inferential performance relative to both standard VA and a
Laplace approximation approach, while being computationally more scalable than
both in practice.

up-sampled HSIs can be further improved by introducing an additional
spatial-domain constraint to the conventional spectral-domain energy function.
We define our spatial-domain constraint as the $L_1$ distance between the
predicted PAN image and the actual PAN image. To estimate the PAN image of the
up-sampled HSI, we also propose a learnable spectral response function (SRF).
Moreover, we noticed that the residual image between the up-sampled HSI and the
reference HSI mainly consists of edge information and very fine structures. In
order to accurately estimate fine information, we propose a novel over-complete
network, called HyperKite, which focuses on learning high-level features by
constraining the receptive from increasing in the deep layers. We perform
experiments on three HSI datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our
DIP-HyperKite over the state-of-the-art pansharpening methods. The deployment
codes, pre-trained models, and final fusion outputs of our DIP-HyperKite and
the methods used for the comparisons will be publicly made available at

poor evaluation of the kinetics of gaseous Ru in the form of RuO$_3$ and
RuO$_4$. This work presents relativistic correlated quantum chemical
calculations performed to determine the possible reactions pathways leading to
the formation of gaseous Ru oxides under NPP severe accident conditions, as a
result of reactions of RuO$_2$ gaseous with air radiolysis products, namely
nitrous and nitrogen oxides. The geometries of the relevant species were
optimized with the TPSSh-5%HF functional of the density, while the total
electronic energies were computed at the CCSD(T) level with extrapolations to
the complete basis set CBS limit. The reaction pathways were fully
characterized by localizing the transition states and all intermediate
structures using the internal coordinate reaction algorithm (IRC). The rate
constants were determined over the temperature range 250-2500 K. It is revealed
that the less kinetically limiting pathway to form Ru gaseous fraction is the
oxidation of Ru by nitrogen oxide, corroborating experimental observations.

humans to migrate in search of better living conditions, including job

migration is, however, challenging because of poor recording, privacy issues
and residence status. This is particularly critical for some classes of
migrants involved in stigmatised, unregulated or illegal activities. Escorting
services or high-end prostitution are well-paid activities that attract workers
all around the world. In this paper, we study international migration patterns
of sex-workers by using network methods. Using an extensive international
online advertisement directory of escorting services and information about
individual escorts, we reconstruct a migrant flow network where nodes represent
either origin or destination countries. The links represent the direct routes
between two countries. The migration network of sex-workers shows different
structural patterns than the migration of the general population. The network
contains a strong core where mutual migration is often observed between a group
of high-income European countries, yet Europe is split into different network
communities with specific ties to non-European countries. We find
non-reciprocal relations between countries, with some of them mostly offering
while others attract workers. The GDP per capita is a good indicator of country
attractiveness for incoming workers and service rates but is unrelated to the
probability of emigration. The median financial gain of migrating, in
comparison to working at the home country, is 15.9%. Only sex-workers coming
from 77% of the countries have financial gains with migration and average gains
decrease with the GDPc of the country of origin. Our results shows that
high-end sex-worker migration is regulated by economic, geographic and cultural
aspects.

Most of these representation methods focus on supervised learning and heavily

in the real world, especially in specialized domains (i.e. biology), as it
needs the annotator to have the domain knowledge to label the graph. To
approach this problem, self-supervised learning provides a feasible solution
for graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level
Graph Contrastive Learning (MLGCL) framework for learning robust representation
of graph data by contrasting space views of graphs. Specifically, we introduce
a novel contrastive view - topological and feature space views. The original
graph is first-order approximation structure and contains uncertainty or error,
while the $k$NN graph generated by encoding features preserves high-order
proximity. Thus $k$NN graph generated by encoding features not only provide a
complementary view, but is more suitable to GNN encoder to extract discriminant
representation. Furthermore, we develop a multi-level contrastive mode to
preserve the local similarity and semantic similarity of graph-structured data
simultaneously. Extensive experiments indicate MLGCL achieves promising results

macroeconomic properties such as GDP and geographic distance, it,

probability distribution that can be chosen arbitrarily and tested against
alternative distributions. Statistical physics approaches construct
maximum-entropy probability distributions of (weighted) graphs from a chosen
set of measurable structural constraints and test distributions resulting from
different constraints. Here we compare and integrate the two approaches by
considering a class of maximum-entropy models that can incorporate
macroeconomic properties used in standard econometric models. We find that the
integrated approach achieves a better performance than the purely econometric
one. These results suggest that the maximum-entropy construction can serve as a
viable econometric framework wherein extensive and intensive margins can be
separately controlled for, by combining topological constraints and dyadic
macroeconomic variables.

or particle beam and a variable ground is developed. The external incident beam
is hereby mechanically coupled to the liquid surface due to surface roughness.
Starting from the Navier Stokes equation the coupled equations for the velocity
potential and the surface height are derived in a shallow-water approximation
with special attention to viscosity. The resulting equations obey conservation
laws for volume and momentum where characteristic potentials for gravitation
and surface tension are identified analogously to conservative forces. The
approximate solutions are discussed in the context of ripple formation in laser
materials processing involving melting of a surface by a laser beam. Linear
stability analysis provides the formation of a damped wave modified by an
interplay between the external beam, the viscosity, and the surface tension.
The limit of small viscosity leads to damped gravitational and the limit of
high viscosity to capillary waves. The resulting wavelengths are in the order
of the ripples occurring in laser welding experiments hinting to the
involvement of hydrodynamic processes in their origin. By discussing the
response of the system to external periodic excitations with the help of
Floquet multipliers, we show that the ripple formation could be triggered by a
a periodically modulated external beam, e.g. appropriate repetition rates of an
incident laser beam. The weak nonlinear stability analysis provides ranges
where hexagonal or stripe structures can appear. The orientation of stripe
structures and ripples are shown to be dependent on the incident angle of the
laser or particle beam where a minimal angle is reported. Numerical simulations
confirm the findings and allow to describe the influence of variable grounds.

statistical and systematic uncertainties are known. Many types of systematic
uncertainties are, however, estimated on the basis of approximate procedures
and thus the values of the assigned errors are themselves uncertain. Here the
impact of the uncertainty {\it on the assigned uncertainty} is investigated in
the context of the muon $g-2$ anomaly. The significance of the observed
discrepancy between the Standard Model prediction of the muon's anomalous
magnetic moment and measured values are shown to decrease substantially if the
relative uncertainty in the uncertainty assigned to the Standard Model
prediction exceeds around 30\%. The reduction in sensitivity increases for
higher significance, so that establishing a $5\sigma$ effect will require not
only small uncertainties but the uncertainties themselves must be estimated
accurately to correspond to one standard deviation.

and scale invariant thanks to the use of Spatial Transformer Network (STN). Our
architecture is composed of three sequential modules that are estimated

matrix to normalize the input image to a reference one; (ii) a differentiable
module to find the region of interest to segment; (iii) a segmentation module,
based on the popular UNet architecture, to delineate the object. Unlike the
original UNet, which strives to learn a complex mapping, including pose and
scale variations, from a finite training dataset, our segmentation module
learns a simpler mapping focusing on images with normalized pose and size.
Furthermore, the use of an automatic bounding box detection through STN allows
saving time and especially memory, while keeping similar performance. We test
the proposed method in kidney and renal tumor segmentation on abdominal
pediatric CT scanners. Results indicate that the estimated STN homogenization
of size and pose accelerates the segmentation (25h), compared to standard
data-augmentation (33h), while obtaining a similar quality for the kidney

heterostructures exhibit complex nanoscale polarization configurations that
arise from a balance of competing electrostatic, elastic, and domain-wall
contributions to the free energy. A key feature of these configurations is that
the polarization can locally have a significant component that is not along the
thin-film surface normal direction, while maintaining zero net in-plane
polarization. PbTiO3/SrTiO3 thin-film superlattice heterostructures on a
conducting SrRuO3 bottom electrode on SrTiO3 have a room-temperature stripe
nanodomain pattern with nanometer-scale lateral period. Ultrafast time-resolved
x-ray free electron laser diffraction and scattering experiments reveal that
above-bandgap optical pulses induce rapidly propagating acoustic pulses and a
perturbation of the domain diffuse scattering intensity arising from the
nanoscale stripe domain configuration. With 400 nm optical excitation, two
separate acoustic pulses are observed: a high-amplitude pulse resulting from
strong optical absorption in the bottom electrode and a weaker pulse arising
from the depolarization field screening effect due to absorption directly
within the superlattice. The picosecond scale variation of the nanodomain
diffuse scattering intensity is consistent with a larger polarization change
than would be expected due to the polarization-tetragonality coupling of
uniformly polarized ferroelectrics. The polarization change is consistent
instead with polarization rotation facilitated by the reorientation of the
in-plane component of the polarization at the domain boundaries of the striped
polarization structure. The complex steady-state configuration within these
ferroelectric heterostructures leads to polarization rotation phenomena that
have been previously available only through the selection of bulk crystal
composition.

problem. For the lack of aligned underwater-terrestrial image pairs, the
unsupervised method is more suited to this task. However, the pure data-driven
unsupervised method usually has difficulty in achieving realistic color
correction for lack of optical constraint. In this paper, we propose a data-
and physics-driven unsupervised architecture that learns underwater vision
restoration from unpaired underwater-terrestrial images. For sufficient domain
transformation and detail preservation, the underwater degeneration needs to be
explicitly constructed based on the optically unambiguous physics law. Thus, we
employ the Jaffe-McGlamery degradation theory to design the generation models,
and use neural networks to describe the process of underwater degradation.
Furthermore, to overcome the problem of invalid gradient when optimizing the
hybrid physical-neural model, we fully investigate the intrinsic correlation
between the scene depth and the degradation factors for the backscattering
estimation, to improve the restoration performance through physical
constraints. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is able to
perform high-quality restoration for unconstrained underwater images without
any supervision. On multiple benchmarks, we outperform several state-of-the-art
supervised and unsupervised approaches. We also demonstrate that our methods
yield encouraging results on real-world applications.

Lindbladians. We identify the underlying algebraic structure by mapping them to
non-Hermitian spin chains and demonstrate that the operator space fragments
into exponentially many (in system size) sectors that are invariant under time
evolution. At the level of quadratic fluctuations we consider the Lindbladian
on the sectors that determine the late time dynamics for the particular case of
the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process (Q-SSEP). We show that the
corresponding blocks in some cases correspond to known Yang-Baxter integrable

detailed analysis of the steady states and slow modes that govern the late time

diffusive but with relevant deviations, that at sufficiently late times and
large distances can be described in terms of a continuum scaling limit which we

a single reionization light-cone model and an ensemble of 50 realisations of
the 21-cm signal to estimate the cosmic variance errors. We calculate the

calculates the bispectrum for all possible unique triangles. We find that the

Only for the squeezed limit triangles, the impact of the light-cone effect

multi-channel ASR has shown its effectiveness in multi-channel speech
recognition. However, the integration of multiple modules makes it more
difficult to perform end-to-end training, particularly given that the
multi-channel speech corpus recorded in real environments with a sizeable data
scale is relatively limited. This paper explores the usage of single-channel
data to improve the multi-channel end-to-end speech recognition system.
Specifically, we design three schemes to exploit the single-channel data,
namely pre-training, data scheduling, and data simulation. Extensive
experiments on CHiME4 and AISHELL-4 datasets demonstrate that all three methods
improve the multi-channel end-to-end training stability and speech recognition
performance, while the data scheduling approach keeps a much simpler pipeline
(vs. pre-training) and less computation cost (vs. data simulation). Moreover,
we give a thorough analysis of our systems, including how the performance is
affected by the choice of front-end, the data augmentation, training strategy,
and single-channel data size.

Here, for the first time we theoretically determine the electronic and

to expand the potentials between the atoms in terms of a sum of seven spin-spin

operators as functions of atom separation are presented and relationships among
the strengths, derived from the dispersive long-range interactions, are
explained. Finally, low-lying spectroscopically relevant ro-vibrational energy

called seeds, hand-selected by experts or scraped from social media. The
quality of social media content varies widely, therefore, we propose a
framework for assigning multi-dimensional quality scores to social media seeds

contributions from social media research for attributing quality to social
media content and users based on credibility, reputation, and influence. We
combined these with additional contributions from the Web archive research that
emphasizes the importance of considering geographical and temporal constraints
when selecting seeds. Next, we developed the Quality Proxies (QP) framework
which assigns seeds extracted from social media a quality score across 10 major
dimensions: popularity, geographical, temporal, subject expert, retrievability,
relevance, reputation, and scarcity. We instantiated the framework and showed
that seeds can be scored across multiple QP classes that map to different
policies for ranking seeds such as prioritizing seeds from local news,
reputable and/or popular sources, etc. The QP framework is extensible and
robust. Our results showed that Quality Proxies resulted in the selection of
quality seeds with increased precision (by ~0.13) when novelty is and is not
prioritized. These contributions provide an explainable score applicable to
rank and select quality seeds for Web archive collections and other domains.

studying the Higgs coupling to the electron, $y_e$, via resonant s-channel
production, $e^+e^- \to H$, in a dedicated run at $\sqrt{s} = m_H$. The
signature for direct Higgs production is a small rise in cross sections for
particular final states, consistent with Higgs decays, over the expectations
for their occurrence due to SM background processes involving $Z^*,\gamma^*$,
or t-channel exchanges. Performing such a measurement is remarkably challenging
for four main reasons. First, the low value of the e$^\pm$ mass leads to a tiny
$y_e$ coupling, and correspondingly small cross section: $\sigma_{ee\to
H}\,\propto m_e^2 = 0.57$ fb accounting for initial-state radiation. Second,
the $e^+e^-$ beams must be monochromatized such that their c.m. energy spread
is commensurate with the narrow width of the SM Higgs boson, $\Gamma_H = 4.1$
MeV, while keeping large beam luminosities. Third, the Higgs mass must also be
known beforehand with a few-MeV accuracy in order to operate the collider at
the resonance peak, $\sqrt{s} = m_H$. Last but not least, the cross sections of
the background processes are many orders-of-magnitude larger than those of the
Higgs decay signals. A generator-level study of 11 Higgs decays using a
multivariate analysis, exploiting BDTs to discriminate signal and background
events, identifies two final states as the most promising ones in terms of
statistical significance: $H\to gg$ and $H\to WW^*\to\ell\nu$ + 2 jets. For a
benchmark 4.1-MeV c.m. energy spread (leading to $\sigma_{ee\to H}\, = 0.28$
fb) and $\mathcal{L}_{int}=10$ ab$^{-1}$, a $1.3\sigma$ signal significance can
be reached, corresponding to an upper limit on the e$^\pm$ Yukawa at 1.6 times
the SM value: $|y_e|<1.6|y^{SM}_e|$ at 95\% confidence level, per IP per year.
Directions for future improvements of the study are outlined.

attention due to their nontrivial topological electronic structure, anomalous
physical properties and superconductivity. Unconventional charge density wave
(CDW) has been detected in AV3Sb5. High-precision electronic structure
determination is essential to understand its origin. Here we unveil electronic
nature of the CDW phase in our high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
measurements on KV3Sb5. We have observed CDW-induced Fermi surface
reconstruction and the associated band folding. The CDW-induced band splitting
and the associated gap opening have been revealed at the boundary of the
pristine and reconstructed Brillouin zones. The Fermi surface- and
momentum-dependent CDW gap is measured and the strongly anisotropic CDW gap is
observed for all the V-derived Fermi surface. In particular, we have observed
signatures of the electron-phonon coupling in KV3Sb5. These results provide key
insights in understanding the nature of the CDW state and its interplay with
superconductivity in AV3Sb5 superconductors.

(AI). SE models may specify the architecture at different levels of abstraction
and for addressing different concerns at various stages of the software
development life-cycle, from early conceptualization and design, to
verification, implementation, testing and evolution. However, AI models may
provide smart capabilities, such as prediction and decision-making support. For
instance, in Machine Learning (ML), which is currently the most popular
sub-discipline of AI, mathematical models may learn useful patterns in the
observed data and can become capable of making predictions. The goal of this
work is to create synergy by bringing models in the said communities together
and proposing a holistic approach to model-driven software development for
intelligent systems that require ML. We illustrate how software models can
become capable of creating and dealing with ML models in a seamless manner. The
main focus is on the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where both ML and
model-driven SE play a key role. In the context of the need to take a
Cyber-Physical System-of-Systems perspective of the targeted architecture, an
integrated design environment for both SE and ML sub-systems would best support
the optimization and overall efficiency of the implementation of the resulting
system. In particular, we implement the proposed approach, called ML-Quadrat,
based on ThingML, and validate it using a case study from the IoT domain, as
well as through an empirical user evaluation. It transpires that the proposed
approach is not only feasible, but may also contribute to the performance leap
of software development for smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) which are
connected to the IoT, as well as an enhanced user experience of the
practitioners who use the proposed modeling solution.

questions. In geosciences this is typically achieved by solving an inference or
inverse problem and interpreting the solution. However, the answer obtained is
often biased because the solution to an inverse problem is nonunique and human
interpretation is a biased process. Interrogation theory provides a systematic
way to find optimal answers by considering their full uncertainty estimates,
and by designing an objective function that defines desirable qualities in the
answer. In this study we demonstrate interrogation theory by quantifying the
size of a particular subsurface structure. The results show that interrogation
theory provides an accurate estimate of the true answer, which cannot be
obtained by direct, subjective interpretation of the solution mean and standard
deviation. This demonstrates the value of interrogation theory. It also shows
that fully nonlinear uncertainty assessments may be critical in order to
address real-world scientific problems, which goes some way towards justifying
their computational expense.

individual clusters from aggregate complexes as identified at lower resolution.
These results indicate the importance of spatial resolution to characterize
SSCs, as low resolution studies of SSCs average over aggregate complexes that
may host SSCs at different stages of evolution. We explore the thermal,
non-thermal, and dust emission associated with the clusters along with dense
molecular tracers to construct a holistic review of the natal SSCs that have
yet to dramatically disrupt their parent molecular clouds. We assess the
production rate of ionizing photons, extinction, total mass, and the star
formation efficiency associated with the clusters. Notably, we find that the
star formation efficiency for the some of the natal clusters is high (>70%),
which suggests that these clusters could remain bound even after the gas is
dispersed from the system from stellar feedback mechanisms. If they remain
bound, these SSCs could survive to become objects indistinguishable from
globular clusters.

and study a class of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) that are
randomly stirred by a spatially smooth and uncorrelated in time forcing term.
To reproduce the fractional, and more specifically multifractal, regularity
nature of fully developed turbulence, these dynamical evolutions incorporate an
homogenous pseudo-differential linear operator of degree 0 that takes care of
transferring energy that is injected at large scales in the system, towards
smaller scales according to a cascading mechanism. In the simplest situation
which concerns the development of fractional regularity in a linear and
Gaussian framework, we derive explicit predictions for the statistical
behaviors of the solution at finite and infinite time. Doing so, we realize a
cascading transfer of energy using linear, although non local, interactions.
These evolutions can be seen as a stochastic version of recently proposed
systems of forced waves intended to model the regime of weak wave turbulence in
stratified and rotational flows. To include multifractal, i.e. intermittent,
corrections to this picture, we get some inspiration from the Gaussian
multiplicative chaos, which is known to be multifractal, to motivate the
introduction of an additional quadratic interaction in these dynamical
evolutions. Because the theoretical analysis of the obtained class of nonlinear
SPDEs is much more demanding, we perform numerical simulations and observe the
non-Gaussian and in particular skewed nature of their solution.

Couette-Poiseuille flow, depending on the frame of reference. In the presence
of rotation, plane Poiseuille flow becomes unstable at a smaller Reynolds

while rotation stabilizes plane Couette flow, the same destabilizes plane
Poiseuille flow faster and forced local accretion disk. Depending on the
various factors, when local linear shear flow becomes Poiseuille flow in the
shearing box due to the presence of extra force, the flow becomes unstable even
for the Keplerian rotation and hence turbulence will pop in there. This helps
in resolving a long standing problem of sub-critical transition to turbulence

quantum interference. Chemical processes with two level atoms and three level
atoms with lambda spectrum are schematically modeled by solving the single

only in the initial states. An example is given of the optical interpretation
of the transition of an electron from atom to atom in terms of the multilevel

the greenhouse control strategy with newly observed data during real-world

real scenarios, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of iGrow in autonomous greenhouse simulation and optimal control.
Particularly, compelling results from the tomato pilot project in real

Forecasting the battery SoH well is imperative to enable preventive maintenance

gradient boosting regression for predicting the SoH timeseries under
circumstances when there is little prior information available about the
batteries. We compared the gradient boosting method with light gradient
boosting, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, random forests, long
short-term memory networks and with combined convolutional neural network and
long short-term memory networks methods. We used multiple predictors and lagged
target signal decomposition results as additional predictors and compared the
yielded prediction results with different sets of predictors for each method.
For this work, we are in possession of a unique data set of 45 lithium-ion
battery packs with large variation in the data. The best model that we derived
was validated by a novel walk-forward algorithm that also calculates point-wise
confidence intervals for the predictions; we yielded reasonable predictions and
confidence intervals for the predictions. Furthermore, we verified this model
against five other lithium-ion battery packs; the best model generalised to
greater extent to this set of battery packs. The results about the final model
suggest that we were able to enhance the results in respect to previously
developed models. Moreover, we further validated the model for extracting cycle
counts presented in our previous work with data from new forklifts; their
battery packs completed around 3000 cycles in a 10-year service period, which
corresponds to the cycle life for commercial Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese (NMC)

methods focus mainly on building hash bucket-based indexing such that the
candidate points can be retrieved quickly. However, existing coarse-grained
structures fail to offer accurate distance estimation for candidate points,
which translates into additional computational overhead when having to examine
unnecessary points. This in turn reduces the performance of query processing.
In contrast, we propose a fast and accurate in-memory LSH framework, called
PM-LSH, that aims to compute c-ANN queries on large-scale, high-dimensional
datasets. First, we adopt a simple yet effective PM-tree to index the data
points. Second, we develop a tunable confidence interval to achieve accurate

used forecast algorithms for complex turbulent systems. A major difficulty in
such a method is the model error that is ubiquitous in practice. Data-driven
machine learning (ML) forecasts can reduce the model error but they often
suffer from the partial and noisy observations. In this paper, a simple but
effective Bayesian machine learning advanced forecast ensemble (BAMCAFE) method
is developed, which combines an available imperfect physics-informed model with
data assimilation (DA) to facilitate the ML ensemble forecast. In the BAMCAFE
framework, a Bayesian ensemble DA is applied to create the training data of the
ML model, which reduces the intrinsic error in the imperfect physics-informed
model simulations and provides the training data of the unobserved variables.
Then a generalized DA is employed for the initialization of the ML ensemble
forecast. In addition to forecasting the optimal point-wise value, the BAMCAFE
also provides an effective approach of quantifying the forecast uncertainty
utilizing a non-Gaussian probability density function that characterizes the
intermittency and extreme events. It is shown using a two-layer Lorenz 96 model
that the BAMCAFE method can significant improve the forecasting skill compared
to the typical reduced-order imperfect models with bare truncation or
stochastic parameterization for both the observed and unobserved large-scale
variables. It is also shown via a nonlinear conceptual model that the BAMCAFE
leads to a comparable non-Gaussian forecast uncertainty as the perfect model
while the associated imperfect physics-informed model suffers from large
forecast biases.

crashes, it should be replaced with the most similar one. Candidate services
are advertised in Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) all

scheme for transferring the knowledge from a teacher model to a student model
is proposed. Existing state-of-the-art methods employ fixed loss functions for
this purpose and ignore the different levels of information that need to be
transferred for different samples. In addition to that, these methods are also
inefficient in terms of data usage. CCKD addresses these issues by leveraging
the confidence assigned by the teacher model to the correct class to devise
sample-specific loss functions (CCKD-L formulation) and targets (CCKD-T
formulation). Further, CCKD improves the data efficiency by employing
self-regulation to stop those samples from participating in the distillation
process on which the student model learns faster. Empirical evaluations on
several benchmark datasets show that CCKD methods achieve at least as much
generalization performance levels as other state-of-the-art methods while being
data efficient in the process. Student models trained through CCKD methods do
not retain most of the misclassifications commited by the teacher model on the
training set. Distillation through CCKD methods improves the resilience of the
student models against adversarial attacks compared to the conventional KD
method. Experiments show at least 3% increase in performance against
adversarial attacks for the MNIST and the Fashion MNIST datasets, and at least
6% increase for the CIFAR10 dataset.

Nevertheless, the large storage and computational overhead of the existing

model compression and potential performance improvement capability, we design a
multi-level HAR modeling pipeline called Stage-Logits-Memory Distillation
(SMLDist) based on the widely-used MobileNet. By paying more attention to the
frequency-related features during the distillation process, the SMLDist
improves the HAR classification robustness of the students. We also propose an
auto-search mechanism in the heterogeneous classifiers to improve
classification performance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that
SMLDist outperforms various state-of-the-art HAR frameworks in accuracy and F1
macro score. The practical evaluation of the Jetson Xavier AGX platform shows
that the SMLDist model is both energy-efficient and computation-efficient.
These experiments validate the reasonable balance between the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed model. The comparative experiments of knowledge
distillation on six public datasets also demonstrate that the SMLDist
outperforms other advanced knowledge distillation methods of students'
performance, which verifies the good generalization of the SMLDist on other
classification tasks, including but not limited to HAR.

and electro-chemo-mechanics modelling are discussed in the context of three
environmental assisted cracking phenomena of particular engineering interest:
hydrogen embrittlement, localised corrosion and corrosion fatigue. Mechanical
processes such as deformation and fracture can be coupled with chemical
phenomena like local reactions, ionic transport and hydrogen uptake and
diffusion. Moreover, these can be combined with the prediction of an evolving
interface, such as a growing pit or a crack, as dictated by a phase field
variable that evolves based on thermodynamics and local kinetics. Suitable for
both microstructural and continuum length scales, this new generation of
simulation-based, multi-physics phase field models can open new modelling

with suboptimal effects in terms of driver delay and frustration, cost, and
impact on the environment. In principle, many transportation networks lack a
unified framework, which will coordinate the traffic in such a manner, in order
to suppress congestion and at the same time improve the travel time of the
users situated in it. The rapid advancements in information, communication, and
computation technologies have given rise to more elaborate modeling frameworks,
aiming to act as the coordination unit necessary to counter the issue of
congestion in real-time conditions. Such actions might have an adverse effect
on the efficiency of the network, prospectively leading to greater waiting time
intervals for each individual driver. We propose a macroscopic model equipped
with an underlying reservation feature, known as Route Reservation Architecture
(RRA). Vehicles enter the network (mainstream-wise or from the on-ramps) as
long as this inflow does not incur a density that exceeds the network's
critical density. Those vehicles prospectively exceeding the critical density
are stored as queues at the origin of the motorway stretch and within the
on-ramps. Once there is sufficient space, for those vehicles to be accommodated
by the respective cell of the network, they are discharged from their queueing
instance at their respective origin, moving towards their assigned path freely.
In previous works, this architecture has been only applied in microscopic
simulations in the context of urban networks without the influence of source
terms (on-ramps). When the critical density of the stretch is reached, the
reservations are activated, instigating a waiting interval to the vehicles
stored at queues, allowing vehicles only to enter the network at a later time
instant, such that the critical density is not crossed.
