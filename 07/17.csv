generated from deep features by hard thresholding, tend to outperform
{-1,1}-binary codes in image retrieval. To obtain better ternary codes, we for
the first time propose to jointly learn the features with the codes by
appending a smoothed function to the networks. During training, the function
could evolve into a non-smoothed ternary function by a continuation method. The
method circumvents the difficulty of directly training discrete functions and
reduces the quantization errors of ternary codes. Experiments show that the
generated codes indeed could achieve higher retrieval accuracy.

between human vocal characteristics and facial features. However, existing
approaches generate faces simply from voice, without exploring the set of
features that contribute to these observed correlations. A computational
methodology to explore this can be devised by rephrasing the question to: ""how
much would a target face have to change in order to be perceived as the
originator of a source voice?"" With this in perspective, we propose a framework
to morph a target face in response to a given voice in a way that facial
features are implicitly guided by learned voice-face correlation in this paper.
Our framework includes a guided autoencoder that converts one face to another,
controlled by a unique model-conditioning component called a gating controller
which modifies the reconstructed face based on input voice recordings. We
evaluate the framework on VoxCelab and VGGFace datasets through human subjects
and face retrieval. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed model.

understand reality, is based not only on mathematical formulas of a theory
suggested as a reasonable explanation for physical phenomena (like general
relativity or quantum mechanics), but also on a mathematical model of reasoning
used to analyze and appraise statements regarding the objective world (for
example, logic of one type or the other). Hence, every time that a certain
construal of reality encounters a problem, there is a choice between a
modification to the mathematical formalism of the physical theory and a change
in the model of reasoning. A case in point is negative construal of quantum
superposition causing the problem of definite outcomes. To be sure, according
to the said construal, it is not the case that a system being in a
superposition of states is exclusively in one of the states constituting the
superposition, which in turn implies that macroscopically differing outcomes of
observation may appear all at once. The usual approach to the problem of
definite outcomes is to modify the quantum mathematical formalism by adding to
it some extra postulates (for instance, the postulate of wave function
collapse). However, since none of the extra postulates proposed so far has
gained broad acceptance, one may try another avenue to resolve the problem,
namely, to replace logic with an alternative mathematical model of reasoning.
This possibility is studied in the present paper.

half our sample stars being situated in the range from 2 M(Sun) to 2.4 M(Sun),
in good agreement with the spectral classifications. Most stars belong to the
thin or thick disk; four objects, however, classify as members of the halo

clouds to explain absorption-line measurements of the circumgalactic medium and
the warm, atomic phase of galactic winds. However, the origin of the cold,
molecular phase in galactic winds has received relatively little theoretical
attention. Studies of the survival of $\sim10^{4}$\,K clouds suggest efficient
radiative cooling may enable the survival of expelled material from galactic
disks. Alternatively, gas colder than 10$^4$\,K may form within the outflow,
including molecules if dust survives the acceleration process. We explore the
survival of dusty clouds in a hot wind with three-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations including radiative cooling and dust modeled as tracer particles.
We find that cold $\sim10^{3}$\,K gas can be destroyed, survive, or transformed
entirely to $\sim 10^4\,$K gas. We establish analytic criteria distinguishing
these three outcomes which compare characteristic cooling times to the system's
`cloud crushing' time. In contrast to typically studied $\sim10^{4}$\,K clouds,
colder clouds are entrained faster than the drag time as a result of efficient
mixing. We find that while dust can in principle survive embedded in the
accelerated clouds, the survival fraction depends critically on the time dust
spends in the hot phase and on the effective threshold temperature for
destruction. We discuss our results in the context of polluting the
circumgalactic medium with dust and metals, as well as understanding
observations suggesting rapid acceleration of molecular galactic winds and ram
pressure stripped tails of jellyfish galaxies.

and changing the binary orbital period. We present three independent methods
(one analytic and two numerical) to investigate the post-impact attitude
stability of Dimorphos as a function of its axial ratios, $a/b$ and $b/c$ ($a
\ge b \ge c$), and the momentum transfer efficiency $\beta$. The first method
uses a novel analytic approach in which we assume a circular orbit and a
point-mass primary that identifies four fundamental frequencies of motion
corresponding to the secondary's mean motion, libration, precession, and
nutation frequencies. At resonance locations among these four frequencies, we
find that attitude instabilities are possible. Using two independent numerical
codes, we recover many of the resonances predicted by the analytic model and
indeed show attitude instability. With one code, we use fast Lyapunov
indicators to show that the secondary's attitude can evolve chaotically near
the resonance locations. Then, using a high-fidelity numerical model, we find
that Dimorphos enters a chaotic tumbling state near the resonance locations and
is especially prone to unstable rotation about its long axis, which can be
confirmed by ESA's Hera mission arriving at Didymos in late 2026. We also show
that a fully coupled treatment of the spin and orbital evolution of both bodies
is crucial to accurately model the long-term evolution of the secondary's spin
state and libration amplitude. Finally, we discuss the implications of a
post-impact tumbling or rolling state, including the possibility of terminating
BYORP evolution if Dimorphos is no longer in synchronous rotation.

motion of nonspinning particles, where the ISCO is the same in both the upper

kinematical fourvelocity of the spinning particle are not always parallel, we
also consider a superluminal bound on the particles motion. In the case of

where tension appear as an additional dynamical degree of freedom and these
tensions are not universal, but rather each string generates its own tension,
which can have a different value for each string. We consider a new background

extinct. To characterize the genetic response to these recent selective
pressures, we collected population genetic data for one successful bivalve
species, Megalonaias nervosa. We identify megabase sized regions that are
nearly monomorphic across the population, a signal of strong, recent selection
reshaping genetic diversity. These signatures of selection encompass a total of
73Mb, greater response to selection than is commonly seen in population genetic
models. We observe 102 duplicate genes with high dN/dS on terminal branches
among regions with sweeps, suggesting that gene duplication is a causative
mechanism of recent adaptation in M. nervosa. Genes in sweeps reflect
functional classes known to be important for Unionid survival, including
anticoagulation genes important for fish host parasitization, detox genes,
mitochondria management, and shell formation. We identify selective sweeps in
regions with no known functional impacts, suggesting mechanisms of adaptation
that deserve greater attention in future work on species survival. In contrast,
polymorphic transposable element insertions appear to be detrimental and
underrepresented among regions with sweeps. TE site frequency spectra are
skewed toward singleton variants, and TEs among regions with sweeps are present
only at low frequency. Our work suggests that duplicate genes are an essential
source of genetic novelty that has helped this successful species succeed in
environments where others have struggled. These results suggest that gene
duplications deserve greater attention in non-model population genomics,

These issues have so far been largely addressed empirically. In this paper, we
first develop a scenario-oriented energy-reserve co-optimization model, which
directly connects reserve procurement with possible outages and load/renewable
power fluctuations without the need for empirical reserve requirements.
Accordingly, reserve can be optimally procured system-wide to handle all
possible future uncertainties with the minimum expected system total cost.
Based on the proposed model, marginal pricing approaches are developed for
energy and reserve, respectively. Locational uniform pricing is established for
energy, and the similar property is also established for the combination of
reserve and re-dispatch. In addition, properties of cost recovery for
generators and revenue adequacy for the system operator are also proven.

chambers offer a path to probe Weakly Interacting Massive Particles scattering
cross sections on nucleus down to the so-called neutrino floor, in a mass range
from few GeV's to hundredths of TeV's. Based on the successful operation of the
DarkSide-50 detector at LNGS, a new and more sensitive experiment,
DarkSide-20k, has been designed and is now under construction. A thorough
understanding of the DarkSide-50 detector response and, therefore, of all kind
of observed events, is essential for an optimal design of the new experiment.
In this paper, we report on a particular set of events, which were not used for
dark matter searches. Namely, standard two-pulse scintillation-ionization
signals accompanied by a small amplitude third pulse, originating from single
or few electrons, in a time window of less than a maximum drift time. We
compare our findings to those of a recent paper of the LUX Collaboration
(D.S.Akerib et al. Phys.Rev.D 102, 092004). Indeed, both experiments observe
events related to photoionization of the cathode. From the measured rate of
these events, we estimate for the first time the quantum efficiency of the
tetraphenyl butadiene deposited on the DarkSide-50 cathode at wavelengths
around 128 nm, in liquid argon. Also, both experiments observe events likely
related to photoionization of impurities in the liquid. The probability of
photoelectron emission per unit length turns out to be one order of magnitude
smaller in DarkSide-50 than in LUX. This result, together with the much larger
measured electron lifetime, coherently hints toward a lower concentration of
contaminants in DarkSide-50 than in LUX.

instant per sensor. Thus each sensor is characterized by a vectorial time
series. We would like to identify the dependency structure among these sensors
and represent it by a graph. When there is only one feature per sensor, the
vector auto-regressive models have been widely adapted to infer the structure
of Granger causality. The resulting graph is referred to as causal graph. Our
first contribution is then extending VAR models to matrix-variate models to
serve the purpose of graph learning. Secondly, we propose two online procedures
respectively in low and high dimensions, which can update quickly the estimates
of coefficients when new samples arrive. In particular in high dimensional
regime, a novel Lasso-type is introduced and we develop its homotopy algorithms
for the online learning. We also provide an adaptive tuning procedure for the
regularization parameter. Lastly, we consider that, the application of AR
models onto data usually requires detrending the raw data, however, this step
is forbidden in online context. Therefore, we augment the proposed AR models by
incorporating trend as extra parameter, and then adapt the online algorithms to
the augmented data models, which allow us to simultaneously learn the graph and

analyse the mixed-modes frequency spectra and characterise the structure of

relevant of the stellar structure and study their evolution on a grid of
models. The proposed method, EGGMiMoSA, relies on the asymptotic description of
mixed modes, defines initial guesses for the parameters, and uses a
Levenberg-Marquardt technique to adjust the mixed-modes pattern efficiently. We
follow the evolution of the mixed-modes parameters along a grid of models from
the subgiant phase to the RGB bump and extend past works. We show the impact of
the mass and composition on their evolution. The evolution of the period
spacing $\Delta\pi_1$, pressure offset $\epsilon_p$, gravity offset
$\epsilon_g$, and coupling factor $q$ as a function of $\Delta\nu$ is little
affected by the chemical composition and it follows two different regimes
depending on the evolutionary stage. On the subgiant branch, the models display
a moderate core-envelope density contrast. The evolution of $\Delta \pi_1$,
$\epsilon_p$, $\epsilon_g$, and $q$ thus significantly changes with the mass.
Also, we demonstrate that, at fixed Z/X and with proper measurements of
$\Delta\pi_1$ and $\Delta\nu$, we may unambiguously constrain the mass, radius
and age of a subgiant star. Conversely, on the red-giant branch, the
core-envelope density contrast becomes very large. Consequently, the evolution
of $\epsilon_p$, $\epsilon_g$ and $q$ as a function of $\Delta\nu$ becomes
independent of the mass. This is also true for $\Delta \pi_1$ in stars with
masses $\lesssim 1.8M_\odot$ because of core electron degeneracy. This
degeneracy is lifted for higher masses, again allowing for a precise
measurement of the age. Overall, our computations qualitatively agree with past
observed and theoretical studies.

that have been operational at the CLASS site in the Atacama desert since June
2016, May 2018, and September 2019, respectively. We show that the
noise-equivalent power measured by the detectors matches the expected noise
model based on on-sky optical loading and lab-measured detector parameters.
Using Moon, Venus, and Jupiter observations, we obtain
power-to-antenna-temperature calibrations and optical efficiencies for the

additional noise sources impacting larger angular scales.

discriminative power of a VQC, we propose a VQC system with the optimal
classical post-processing -- maximum-likelihood estimation on measuring all VQC
output qubits. Via extensive numerical simulations, we find that the error of
VQC quantum data classification typically decay exponentially with the circuit
depth, when the VQC architecture is extensive -- the number of gates does not
shrink with the circuit depth. This fast error suppression ends at the
saturation towards the ultimate Helstrom limit of quantum state discrimination.
On the other hand, non-extensive VQCs such as quantum convolutional neural
networks are sub-optimal and fail to achieve the Helstrom limit. To achieve the
best performance for a given VQC, the optimal classical post-processing is
crucial even for a binary classification problem. To simplify VQCs for

infants or monkeys, the calibration data generally suffer from high
contamination. Outliers are typically organized in clusters, corresponding to
the time intervals when subjects were not looking at the calibration points. In
this type of multimodal distributions, most central tendency measures fail at
estimating the principal fixation coordinates (the first mode), resulting in
errors and inaccuracies when mapping the gaze to the screen coordinates. Here,
we developed a new algorithm to identify the first mode of multivariate
distributions, named BRIL, which rely on recursive depth-based filtering. This
novel approach was tested on artificial mixtures of Gaussian and Uniform
distributions, and compared to existing methods (conventional depth medians,
robust estimators of location and scatter, and clustering-based approaches). We
obtained outstanding performances, even for distributions containing very high
proportions of outliers, both grouped in clusters and randomly distributed.
Finally, we demonstrate the strength of our method in a real-world scenario

of this goes by showing that the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence coincides with
the regularized measured R\'enyi divergence, which in turn is proved by
asymptotic pinching, a fundamentally finite-dimensional technique. Thus, while
the notion of the sandwiched R\'enyi divergences was extended recently to
density operators on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space (even for states of
a von Neumann algebra), these quantities were so far lacking an operational
interpretation similar to the finite-dimensional case, and it has also been
open whether they coincide with the regularized measured R\'enyi divergences.
In this paper we fill this gap by answering both questions in the positive for
density operators on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, using a simple
finite-dimensional approximation technique.
  We also initiate the study of the sandwiched R\'enyi divergences, and the
related problem of the strong converse exponent, for pairs of positive

interesting from the purely mathematical point of view of extending the concept
of R\'enyi (and other) divergences to settings beyond the standard one of
positive trace-class operators (positive normal functionals in the von Neumann
algebra setting). In this spirit, we also discuss the definition and some

(axions) in plasmas with background magnetic fields, ${\bf B}$. We show that,
to leading order in the axion-photon coupling, the conversion probability,
$P_{\gamma \to a}$, is given by the one-dimensional power spectrum of the
magnetic field components perpendicular to the particle trajectory.
Equivalently, we express $P_{\gamma \to a}$ as the Fourier transform of the
magnetic field autocorrelation function, and establish a dictionary between
properties of the real-space magnetic field and the energy-dependent conversion
probability. For axions more massive than the plasma frequency,
($m_a>\omega_{\rm pl}$), we use this formalism to analytically solve the
problem of perturbative axion-photon mixing in a general magnetic field. In the
general case where $\omega_{\rm pl}/m_a$ varies arbitrarily along the
trajectory, we show that a naive application of the standard formalism for
'resonant' conversion can give highly inaccurate results, and that a careful
calculation generically gives non-resonant contributions at least as large as
the resonant contribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate how techniques based on
the Fast Fourier Transform provide a new, highly efficient numerical method for
calculating axion-photon mixing. We briefly discuss magnetic field modelling in
galaxy clusters in the light of our results and argue, in particular, that a
recently proposed 'regular' model used for studying axion-photon mixing
(specifically applied to the Perseus cluster) is inconsistent with
observations. Our formalism suggest new methods to search for imprints of
axions, and will be important for spectrographs with percent level sensitivity,
which includes existing X-ray observations by Chandra as well as the upcoming
Athena mission.

is critical for extracting a maximal amount of cosmological information from
current and upcoming weak lensing surveys. In this paper, we study the impact
of the intrinsic alignment of galaxies (IA) on three promising probes measured
from aperture mass maps -- the lensing peaks, minima and full PDF, in
comparison and in combination with the shear two-point correlation functions
($\gamma$-2PCFs). Our two-dimensional IA infusion method converts the
light-cone-projected mass sheets into projected tidal tensors, which are then
linearly coupled to an intrinsic ellipticity component with a strength
controlled by the coupling parameter $A_{\rm IA}$. We validate our method with
the $\gamma$-2PCFs statistics, recovering well the analytical calculations from
the linear alignment model of Bridle \& King in a full tomographic setting, and
for different $A_{\rm IA}$ values. We next use our method to infuse at the
galaxy catalogue level a non-linear IA model that includes the
density-weighting term introduced in \citet{Blazek2015}, and compute the impact
on the three aperture mass map statistics. We find that large \snr peaks are
maximally affected, with deviations reaching 30\% (10\%) for a {\it
Euclid}-like (KiDS-like) survey. Modelling the signal in a $w$CDM cosmology
universe with $N$-body simulations, we forecast the cosmological bias caused by
unmodelled IA for 100 deg$^2$ of {\it Euclid}-like data, finding very large
offsets in $w_0$ (5-10$\sigma_{\rm stat}$), $\Omega_{\rm m}$ (4-6$\sigma_{\rm

compelling avenue to account for IA in beyond-two-point weak lensing

least some short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). This connection has ushered in an
era in which broadband observations of SGRBs, together with measurements of the
time delay between the gravitational waves and the electromagnetic radiation,
allow to probe the properties of the emitting outflow and its engine to an
unprecedented detail. Since the structure of the radiating outflow is molded by
the interaction of a relativistic jet with the binary ejecta, it is of
paramount importance to study the system in a realistic setting. Here we
present a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a relativistic jet
propagating in the ejecta of a BNS merger, which were computed with a general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation. We find that the jet's centroid
oscillates around the axis of the system, due to inhomogeneities encountered in
the propagation. These oscillations allow the jet to find the path of least
resistance and travel faster than an identical jet in smooth ejecta. In our
setup the breakout time is ~0.6 sec, comparable to the expected central engine
duration in SGRBs and possibly a non-negligible fraction of the total delay
between the gravitational and gamma-ray signals. Our simulation also shows that
energy is carried in roughly equal amounts by the jet and by the cocoon, and
that about 20 per cent of the injected energy is transferred to the ejecta via

models based on the effective-field-theory (EFT) approach have the largest
reach, standard perturbation theory has the shortest, and `classical' resummed
schemes lie in between. The gain from EFT, however, is less than in previous
studies. We show that the estimated range of accuracy of the EFT predictions is
heavily influenced by the procedure adopted to fit the amplitude of the
counterterms. For the volumes probed by galaxy redshift surveys, our results
indicate that it is advantageous to set three counterterms of the EFT
bispectrum to zero and measure the fourth from the power spectrum. We also find
that large fluctuations in the estimated reach occur between different
realisations. We conclude that it is difficult to unequivocally define a range
of accuracy for the models containing free parameters. Finally, we
approximately account for systematic effects introduced by the $N$-body
technique either in terms of a scale- and shape-dependent bias or by boosting
the statistical error bars of the measurements (as routinely done in the
literature). We find that the latter approach artificially inflates the reach

emission of non-thermal particles accelerated by magnetic reconnection events
in the accretion flow. We use the results from PIC simulations of magnetic
reconnection to post-process 3D two-temperature GRMHD simulations of a
magnetically arrested disc (MAD). We identify current sheets, retrieve their

compute the expected non-thermal synchrotron emission. We find that the flux
eruptions of MADs can provide suitable conditions for accelerating non-thermal

and near-infrared flares. For a suitable choice of current-sheet parameters and
a simpified synchrotron cooling prescription, the model can simultaneously
reproduce the quiescent and flaring X-ray luminosities as well as the X-ray
spectral shape. While the near-infrared flares are mainly due to an increase in
the temperature near the black hole during the MAD flux eruptions, the X-ray
emission comes from narrow current sheets bordering highly magnetized,
low-density regions near the black hole and equatorial current sheets where the
flux on the black hole reconnects. As a result, not all infrared flares are
accompanied by X-ray ones. The non-thermal flaring emission can extend to very

fixed to the sea floor at a depth of 2475 m. The runs with synthetic data
reveal that we can reliably model the emitted bioluminescent flashes of the

of light sources highly depends on the configuration of the telescope. Precise
measurements of the efficiencies of the detectors and the attenuation length of
the water are crucial to reconstruct the light emission. Finally, the

poorly understood jet launching mechanism. We investigate the morphology and
kinematics of the Th 28 micro-jets with the aim of characterizing their
structure and outflow activity, using optical integral-field spectroscopy
observations obtained with VLT/MUSE. We use spectro-imaging and
position-velocity maps to investigate the kinematic and morphological features
of the jet, and obtain a catalogue of emission lines in which the jet is
visible. A Lucy-Richardson deconvolution procedure is used to differentiate the
structure of the inner micro-jet region. Spatial profiles extracted
perpendicular to the jet axis are fitted to investigate the jet width, opening
angle and the evolution of the jet axis. We confirm the previously identified
knot HHW$_{2}$ within the red-shifted jet and identify three additional knots
in each lobe for the first time. We also find [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission
from the blue-shifted micro-jet including the knot closest to the star. Proper
motions for the innermost knots on each side are estimated and we show that new
knots are ejected on an approximate timescale of 10-15 years. The jet axis
centroids show a point-symmetric wiggle within the inner portion of both
micro-jets indicating precession. We use the jet shape to measure a precession
period of 8 years, with a half-opening angle < 0.6$^{\circ}$. This may provide
an alternative explanation for the rotation signatures previously reported. We
find the jet shape to be compatible with precession due to a brown dwarf
companion orbiting at a separation $\leq$ 0.3 au.

that lean machine learning (LeanML) can drastically slash avoidable wastes in

machine learning capabilities and, in so doing, further democratize access to
machine learning. The lean design pattern we propose in this paper is based on
two realizations. First, it is possible to estimate the best performance one
may achieve when predicting an outcome $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ using a given set of
explanatory variables $x \in \mathcal{X}$, for a wide range of performance
metrics, and without training any predictive model. Second, doing so is
considerably easier, faster, and cheaper than learning the best predictive
model. We derive formulae expressing the best $R^2$, MSE, classification
accuracy, and log-likelihood per observation achievable when using $x$ to
predict $y$ as a function of the mutual information $I\left(y; x\right)$, and
possibly a measure of the variability of $y$ (e.g. its Shannon entropy in the
case of classification accuracy, and its variance in the case regression MSE).
We illustrate the efficacy of the LeanML design pattern on a wide range of
regression and classification problems, synthetic and real-life.

manipulation leveraging a deep neural network called DeformerNet. Controlling
the shape of a 3D object requires an effective state representation that can
capture the full 3D geometry of the object. Current methods work around this

object in 2D image space, which does not truly address the 3D shape control
problem. Instead, we explicitly use 3D point clouds as the state representation
and apply Convolutional Neural Network on point clouds to learn the 3D
features. These features are then mapped to the robot end-effector's position
using a fully-connected neural network. Once trained in an end-to-end fashion,
DeformerNet directly maps the current point cloud of a deformable object, as
well as a target point cloud shape, to the desired displacement in robot
gripper position. In addition, we investigate the problem of predicting the
manipulation point location given the initial and goal shape of the object.

assume a homogenous diffuse medium and are evaluated based on contrast,

diffuse and specular regions and the assumption of a homogeneous medium does
not hold good in all cases. Eventhough, there are some adaptive beamforming
approaches proposed in literature, they are mostly for receive beamforming.
This study is aimed at investigating the relevance of transmission schemes in
characterizing the diffuse and specular reflections, particularly at high frame
rates. The transmit wavefront interaction behavior on the tissue interfaces for
two high frame-rate transmission modalities, i.e. conventional synthetic
transmit aperture imaging and multi-angle plane-wave imaging, are analyzed for
multiple in-vitro and in-vivo radio-frequency datasets. Two novel visualization
perspectives are proposed called contour isolines and directivity variance to
understand the wave interaction with different tissue interfaces by considering
the scalar and vector aspects of the reflected intensities respectively. We
also rationalize the relevance of choosing the appropriate receive beamforming
scheme according to the transmission modality through a comparison of delay and
sum, filtered delay multiply and sum, minimum variance distortionless response,
and specular beamforming algorithms. It is found that a synergistic blend of
transmit and receive beamforming schemes adaptive to the tissue is inevitable

implementation on quantum hardware. For example, dimensionally-reducing gauge
theories on small spatial tori produces quantum mechanical models which,
despite being relatively simple to solve, retain interesting vacuum and
symmetry structures from the parent gauge theories. Here we consider quantum

encoded in a Rydberg atom. Simulating the Rydberg atom with realistic
experimental parameters, we demonstrate that the essential physics can be

have been left with highly non-representative samples, relying on constructed
weights to make these samples representative of the desired target population.
Though practitioners employ valuable expert knowledge to choose what variables,
$X$ must be adjusted for, they rarely defend particular functional forms
relating these variables to the response process or the outcome. Unfortunately,
commonly-used calibration weights -- which make the weighted mean $X$ in the
sample equal that of the population -- only ensure correct adjustment when the
portion of the outcome and the response process left unexplained by linear
functions of $X$ are independent. To alleviate this functional form dependency,
we describe kernel balancing for population weighting (kpop). This approach
replaces the design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ with a kernel matrix, $\mathbf{K}$
encoding high-order information about $\mathbf{X}$. Weights are then found to
make the weighted average row of $\mathbf{K}$ among sampled units approximately
equal that of the target population. This produces good calibration on a wide
range of smooth functions of $X$, without relying on the user to explicitly
specify those functions. We describe the method and illustrate it by
application to polling data from the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

  Using tools from Markov chain analysis, we show the existence of a strategy
achieving slow mixing times, exponential in the policy parameters. This result
emphasizes the imperative need to understand convergence rates in mining games,
validating the standard models. Towards this end, we provide upper bounds for
the mixing time of certain meaningful classes of strategies. This result yields
criteria for establishing that long-term averaged functions are coherent as
payoff functions. Moreover, by studying hitting times, we provide a criterion
to validate the common simplification of considering finite states models. For
both considered objectives functions, we provide explicit formulae depending on
the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, this
shows that both mentioned objectives are not equivalent. Finally, we perform a
market share case study in a particular regime of the game. More precisely, we
show that an strategic player with a sufficiently large processing power can
impose negative revenue on honest players.

  Processing Operation under Uncertainty","26 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Variations of physical and chemical characteristics of biomass reduce
equipment utilization and increase operational costs of biomass processing.
Biomass processing facilities use sensors to monitor the changes in biomass
characteristics. Integrating sensory data into the operational decisions in
biomass processing will increase its flexibility to the changing biomass
conditions. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage stochastic programming
model that minimizes the expected operational costs by identifying the initial
inventory level and creating an operational decision policy for equipment speed
settings. These policies take the sensory information data and the current
biomass inventory level as inputs to dynamically adjust inventory levels and
equipment settings according to the changes in the biomass' characteristics. We
ensure that a prescribed target reactor utilization is consistently achieved by
penalizing the violation of the target reactor feeding rate. A case study is
developed using real-world data collected at Idaho National Laboratory's
biomass processing facility. We show the value of multi-stage stochastic
programming from an extensive computational experiment. Our sensitivity
analysis indicates that updating the infeed rate of the system, the processing
speed of equipment, and bale sequencing based on the moisture level of biomass
improves the processing rate of the reactor and reduces operating costs.

connect its current properties to its past. We explore hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations to investigate how the chemical abundances of stars
might be linked to their origins. Using hierarchical clustering of abundance
measurements in two Milky Way-like simulations with distributed and steady star
formation histories, we find that abundance clusters of stars comprise
different groups in birth place ($R_\text{birth}$) and time (age). Simulating
observational abundance errors (0.05 dex), we find that to trace discrete
groups of ($R_\text{birth}$, age) requires a large vector of abundances. Using
15-element abundances (Fe, O, Mg, S, Si, C, P, Mn, Ne, Al, N, V, Ba, Cr, Co),
up to $\approx$ 10 clusters can be defined with $\approx$ 25% overlap in
($R_\text{birth}$, age). We build a simple model to show that it is possible to
infer a star's age and $R_\text{birth}$ from abundances with precisions of
$\pm$0.06 Gyr and $\pm$1.17 kpc respectively. We find that abundance clustering
is ineffective for a third simulation, where low-$\alpha$ stars form
distributed in the disc and early high-$\alpha$ stars form more rapidly in
clumps that sink towards the galactic center as their constituent stars evolve
to enrich the interstellar medium. However, this formation path leads to large
age-dispersions across the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane, which is inconsistent
with the Milky Way's observed properties. We conclude that abundance clustering
is a promising approach toward charting the history of our Galaxy.

nearly optimal bounds for various problems such as rank computation, finding a
maximal linearly independent subset of columns (a basis), regression, or

question of Nelson and Nguyen (FOCS, 2013). This question is regarding the
logarithmic factors in the sketching dimension of existing oblivious subspace
embeddings that achieve constant-factor approximation. We show how to bypass
this question using a refined sketching technique, and obtain optimal or nearly

mapping of Indyk based on uncertainty principles and extractors, which after
first applying known oblivious subspace embeddings, allows us to quickly spread
out the mass of the vector so that sampling is now effective. We thereby avoid
a logarithmic factor in the sketching dimension that is standard in bounds
proven using the matrix Chernoff inequality. For the fundamental problems of
rank computation and finding a basis, our algorithms improve Cheung, Kwok, and
Lau (JACM, 2013), and are optimal to within a constant factor and a poly(log

cloud computing era. Memory access patterns have been demonstrated to leak
critical information such as security keys and a program's spatial and temporal
information. This information leak poses an even more significant privacy
challenge in machine learning models with embedding tables. Embedding tables
are routinely used to learn categorical features from training data. Even
knowing the locations of the embedding table entries accessed, not the data
within the embedding table, will compromise categorical input data to the
model. Embedding entries are privacy-sensitive since they disclose valuable
properties about the user. Oblivious RAM (ORAM), and its enhanced variants such
as PathORAM have emerged as viable solutions to hide leakage from memory access
streams.
  In this work, we present LAORAM, an ORAM framework explicitly designed to
protect user privacy during embedding table training. LAORAM exploits the
unique property of training, the training samples used in the future are known
beforehand. LAORAM preprocesses the training samples to identify the memory
blocks which are accessed together in the near future. The system tries to
assign these blocks to as few paths as possible within the PathORAM
infrastructure.
  LAORAM does this operation by combining multiple blocks accessed together as
superblocks. To further increase performance, LAORAM uses a fat-tree structure
for PathORAM reducing the number of background evictions required, which
improves the stash usage. We have evaluated LAORAM using both a recommendation
model (DLRM) and a NLP model (XLM-R) embedding table configurations. LAORAM
performs 5 times faster than PathORAM on a recommendation dataset (Kaggle) and
5.4x faster on a NLP dataset (XNLI), while guaranteeing the same security

in a gas-liquid coexistent CO2 dispersion, estimating the possible CO2
concentration change in water, and comparing with the CO2 solubility data.
Finally, we quantify the CO2 mass transfer by directly calculating the CO2
dissolution rate in water and estimating the volumetric mass transfer
coefficient ($k_{L}a$). The results show that the mass transfer may be
influenced by the specific area ($a$), CO2 concentration gradient in the water
slug, and the traveling speed of a dispersion.

  Interpretation for the Legal Principle of Data Minimization","To appear at ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and
  Transparency, 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.CY cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Modern machine learning systems are increasingly characterized by extensive
personal data collection, despite the diminishing returns and increasing
societal costs of such practices. Yet, data minimisation is one of the core
data protection principles enshrined in the European Union's General Data
Protection Regulation ('GDPR') and requires that only personal data that is
adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary is processed. However, the
principle has seen limited adoption due to the lack of technical
interpretation.
  In this work, we build on literature in machine learning and law to propose
FIDO, a Framework for Inhibiting Data Overcollection. FIDO learns to limit data
collection based on an interpretation of data minimization tied to system
performance. Concretely, FIDO provides a data collection stopping criterion by
iteratively updating an estimate of the performance curve, or the relationship
between dataset size and performance, as data is acquired. FIDO estimates the
performance curve via a piecewise power law technique that models distinct
phases of an algorithm's performance throughout data collection separately.
Empirical experiments show that the framework produces accurate performance
curves and data collection stopping criteria across datasets and feature
acquisition algorithms. We further demonstrate that many other families of
curves systematically overestimate the return on additional data. Results and
analysis from our investigation offer deeper insights into the relevant
considerations when designing a data minimization framework, including the
impacts of active feature acquisition on individual users and the feasability
of user-specific data minimization. We conclude with practical recommendations
for the implementation of data minimization.

recover the blood velocity vectors from the Doppler scalar fields in an

imposing physical constraints. The iVFM consisted in minimizing regularized
Doppler residuals subject to the condition that two fluid-dynamics constraints
were satisfied, namely planar mass conservation, and free-slip boundary
conditions. The optimization problem was solved by using the Lagrange
multiplier method. A finite-difference discretization of the optimization
problem, written in the polar coordinate system centered on the cardiac
ultrasound probe, led to a sparse linear system. The single regularization
parameter was determined automatically for non-supervision considerations. The
physics-constrained method was validated using realistic intracardiac flow data
from a patient-specific CFD model. The numerical evaluations showed that the
iVFM-derived velocity vectors were in very good agreement with the CFD-based
original velocities, with relative errors ranged between 0.3 and 12%. We
calculated two macroscopic measures of flow in the cardiac region of interest,
the mean vorticity and mean stream function, and observed an excellent
concordance between physics-constrained iVFM and CFD. The capability of
physics-constrained iVFM was finally tested with in vivo color Doppler data

  synthetic gene circuit",,,,,"q-bio.CB q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During organismal development, biochemical reaction networks sense and
respond to mechanical forces to coordinate embryonic patterning with embryo
morphogenesis. Factors such as cortical tension, cell density, and matrix
mechanical properties influence differentiation and cell fate decisions by
modulating gene regulatory signaling networks. A major goal in synthetic
development is to construct gene regulatory circuits that program the
patterning and morphogenesis of synthetic multicellular structures. However, in
the synthetic context, little is known regarding how the physical properties of
the growth environment impact the behavior of synthetic gene circuits. Here, we
exploit physical-chemical coupling observed in a synthetic patterning circuit
in order to control the size and spatial distribution of patterned synthetic
cell sheets. We show that cell density attenuates the propagation of signal
between neighboring cells in a multicellular sheet containing a
contact-dependent patterning circuit based on the synNotch signaling system.
Density-dependent attenuation leads to a signal propagation wave that exhibits
distinct qualitative phases of persistent propagation, transient propagation,
and no propagation. Through computational modeling, we demonstrate that cell
growth parameters determine the phase of propagation observed within a growing
cell sheet. Using growth-modulating drugs and spatial density gradients, we
control the size of synNotch-activated cell populations and generate
tissue-scale activation gradients and kinematic waves. Our study reveals that
density-dependent synNotch activity can be exploited to control a synthetic
multicellular patterning circuit. More broadly, we show that synthetic gene
circuits can be critically impacted by their physical context, providing an
alternate means for programming circuit behavior.

considering human-machine interfaces in different phases of the life cycle of
technology - the development, implementation, testing, use and disposal.
Drawing from our work on ethics of autonomous intelligent robocars, and the
existing literature on ethics of robotics, our contribution consists of a set
of values and ethical principles with identified challenges and proposed
approaches for meeting them. This may help stakeholders in the field of
intelligent autonomous robotics to connect ethical principles with their
applications. Our recommendations of ethical requirements for autonomous cars
can be used for other types of intelligent autonomous robots, with the caveat
for social robots that require more research regarding interactions with the

teams through multi-criteria analysis. Furthermore, we argue for the need of a
continuous development of ethical principles, guidelines, and regulations,

reinforced composite whose microstructure is represented by two general
microcells accounting for different deformation mechanisms, microstrucural
phases and geometry arrangement. Specifically, in this approach the microstrain
modes used for building the reduced order model (ROM) are obtained through
standard proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) techniques applied over
snapshots of a representative sampling strain space. Additionally, a reduced
number of integration points is obtained by exactly integrating the main free
energy modes resulting from the sampling energy snapshots. The outcome consists
of a number of dominant strain modes integrated over a remarkably reduced
number of integration points which provide the support to evaluate the
constitutive behavior of the microstructural phases. It is emphasized that
stresses are computed according to the selected constitutive law at the reduced
integration points and, therefore, the strategy inherits advantageous
properties such as model completeness and customization of material properties.
Overall results are discussed in terms of the consistency of the multiscale

distribution function consisting of the Maxwellian core and the magnetic-field

use an electron strahl distribution function obtained as a solution of a weakly
collisional drift-kinetic equation, representative of a strahl affected by
Coulomb collisions but unadulterated by possible broadening from turbulence.
This distribution function is essentially non-Maxwellian and varies with the
heliospheric distance. The stability analysis is performed with the
Vlasov-Maxwell linear solver LEOPARD. We find that depending on the
heliospheric distance, the core-strahl electron distribution becomes unstable
with respect to sunward-propagating kinetic-Alfv\'en, magnetosonic, and
whistler modes, in a broad range of propagation angles. The wavenumbers of the
unstable modes are close to the ion inertial scales, and the radial distances
at which the instabilities first appear are on the order of 1 AU. However, we
have not detected any instabilities driven by resonant wave interactions with
the superthermal strahl electrons. Instead, the observed instabilities are
triggered by a relative drift between the electron and ion cores necessary to
maintain zero electric current in the solar wind frame (ion frame). Contrary to
strahl distributions modeled by shifted Maxwellians, the electron strahl
obtained as a solution of the kinetic equation is stable. Our results are
consistent with the previous studies based on a more restricted solution for
the electron strahl.

more than two eigenvalues). Our approaches are exact and do not use any

main directions in the parametric-shift-rule extensions are 1) polynomial
expansion of the exponential unitary operator based on a limited number of
different eigenvalues in the generator and 2) decomposition of the generator as
a linear combination of low-eigenvalue operators (e.g. operators with only 2 or
3 eigenvalues). These techniques have a range of scalings for the number of
needed expectation values with the number of generator eigenvalues from
quadratic (for polynomial expansion) to linear and even $\log_2$ (for generator
decompositions). This allowed us to propose efficient differentiation schemes

set of stopping systems than the set of stopping times (namely, the set of
split stopping times), where the payoff process $\xi$ is irregular and in the
case of a general filtration. Split stopping times are a powerful tool for
modeling financial contracts and derivatives that depend on multiple conditions
or triggers, and for incorporating stochastic processes with jumps and other
types of discontinuities. We show that the value family can be aggregated by an
optional process $v$, which is characterized as the Snell envelope of the
reward process $\xi$ over split stopping times. Using this, we prove the
existence and uniqueness of a solution $Y$ to irregular reflected BSDEs. In the
second part of the paper, motivated by the classical Dynkin game with
completely irregular rewards considered by Grigorova et al. (2018), we
generalize the previous equations to the case of two reflecting barrier
processes.

resolved at the Dirac point on the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ termination. In contrast,
antiferromagnetic MnBi$_6$Te$_{10}$ exhibits gapless topological surface states
on all terminations. Transmission electron microscopy and magnetization

to shed light on the contribution of the disk to these changes, especially
those related to the long cycle, occurring on timescales of hundreds of days.
We studied I-band OGLE photometric times series spanning 18.5 years,
constructing disk models by analyzing the orbital light curve at 52 consecutive
epochs. An optimized simplex algorithm was used to solve the inverse problem by
adjusting the light curve with the best stellar-orbital-disk parameters for the
system. We applied principal components analysis to the parameters to evaluate
their dependence and variability. We constructed a description of the mass
transfer rate in terms of disk parameters. We find that the light variability
can be understood in terms of a variable mass transfer rate and variable
accretion disk. The system brightness at orbital phase 0.25 follows the long
cycle and is correlated with the mass transfer rate and the disk thickness. The
long-cycle brightness variations can be understood in terms of differential
occultation of the hotter star by a disk of variable thickness. Our model fits
the overall light curve during 18.5 years well, including epochs of reversal of
main and secondary eclipse depths. The disk radius cyclically change around the
tidal radius, decoupled from changes in the mass transfer rate or system
brightness, suggesting that viscous delay might explain the non-immediate
response. Although the disk is large and fills a large fraction of the hot star
Roche lobe, Lindblad resonance are far beyond the disk, excluding viscous
dissipation as a major source of photometric variability.

quaternions allow designing the visual servoing task in a more compact manner
and provide robustness to manipulator singularities. Given an object point
cloud, LoCoMo generates a ranked list of grasp and pre-grasp poses, which are
used as desired poses for visual servoing. Whenever the object moves (tracked
by visual marker tracking), the desired pose updates automatically. For this,
capitalising on the dual quaternion spatial distance error, we propose a
dynamic grasp re-ranking metric to select the best feasible grasp for the
moving object. This allows the robot to readily track and grasp arbitrarily
moving objects. In addition, we also explore the robot null-space with our
controller to avoid joint limits so as to achieve smooth trajectories while
following moving objects. We evaluate the performance of the proposed visual
servoing by conducting simulation experiments of grasping various objects using

Ia, previously referred to as ""super-Chandrasekhar"" SNe Ia. It is bright in the
UV and NIR, lacks a clear i-band secondary maximum, shows a strong and
persistent C II feature, and has a low Si II $\lambda$6355 velocity. However,
some of its properties are also extreme among the subgroup. ASASSN-15hy is
under-luminous (M$_{B,peak}=-19.14^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$ mag), red
($(B-V)_{Bmax}=0.18^{+0.01}_{-0.03}$ mag), yet slowly declining
($\Delta{m_{15}}(B)=0.72 \pm 0.04$ mag). It has the most delayed onset of the
i-band maximum of any 03fg-like SN. ASASSN-15hy lacks the prominent H-band
break emission feature that is typically present during the first month past
maximum in normal SNe Ia. Such events may be a potential problem for
high-redshift SN Ia cosmology. ASASSN-15hy may be explained in the context of
an explosion of a degenerate core inside a non-degenerate envelope. The
explosion impacting the non-degenerate envelope with a large mass provides
additional luminosity and low ejecta velocities. An initial deflagration
burning phase is critical in reproducing the low $^{56}$Ni mass and luminosity,
while the large core mass is essential in providing the large diffusion time
scales required to produce the broad light curves. The model consists of a
rapidly rotating 1.47 $M_{\odot}$ degenerate core and a 0.8 $M_{\odot}$

formulate a spatiotemporal mathematical model to evaluate the user-plane
latency and reliability performance of millimetre wave (mmWave) massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) URLLC with reactive and K-repetition

approximate expressions for the latent access failure probability and validate
them using numerical simulations. The results show that, under certain

no significant improvement in reliability. Finally, we conclude that mmWave
massive MIMO alone is not enough to provide the performance guarantees required

by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle. The chromatic polynomial of a graph $G$, denoted
$P(G,m)$, is equal to the number of proper $m$-colorings of $G$. A well-known
tool for computing the chromatic polynomial of graph $G$ is the
deletion-contraction formula which relates $P(G,m)$ to the chromatic
polynomials of two smaller graphs. The DP color function of a graph $G$,
denoted $P_{DP}(G,m)$, is a DP-coloring analogue of the chromatic polynomial,
and $P_{DP}(G,m)$ is the minimum number of DP-colorings of $G$ over all
possible $m$-fold covers. In this paper we present a deletion-contraction
relation for the DP color function. To make this possible, we extend the
definition of the DP color function to multigraphs. We also introduce the dual
DP color function of a graph $G$, denoted $P^*_{DP}(G,m)$, which counts the
maximum number of DP-colorings of $G$ over certain $m$-fold covers. We show how
the dual DP color function along with our deletion-contraction relation yields
a new general lower bound on the DP color function of a graph.

for the maps induced by the octonionic inner products, and it should be
replaced with the octonionic para-linearity. However, to introduce the notion
of the octonionic para-linearity we encounter an insurmountable obstacle. That
is, the axiom $$\left\langle pu ,u\right\rangle=p\left\langle u
,u\right\rangle$$ for any octonion $p$ and element $u\in H$ introduced by
Goldstine and Horwitz in 1964 can not be interpreted as a property to be obeyed
by the octonionic para-linear maps. In this article, we solve this critical
problem by showing that this axiom is in fact non-independent from others. This
enables us to initiate the study of octonionic para-linear maps. We can thus
establish the octonionic Riesz representation theorem which, up to isomorphism,
identifies two octonionic Hilbert spaces with one being the dual of the other.
The dual space consists of continuous left \almost linear functionals and it
becomes a right $\O$-module under the multiplication defined in terms of the
second associators which measures the failure of $\O$-linearity. This right
multiplication has an alternative expression $${(f\odot p)(x)}=pf(p^{-1}x)p,$$
which is a generalized Moufang identity. Remarkably, the multiplication is
compatible with the canonical norm, i.e., $$\fsh{f\odot p}=\fsh{f}\abs{p}.$$
Our final conclusion is that para-linearity is the nonassociative counterpart
of linearity.

part of the Global Fit produces GW inferences which are marginalized over
uncertainty in the spacecraft separations and allows for independent estimation
of the spacecraft orbits. We demonstrate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
inferences of the six time-independent delays required in the rigidly rotating
approximation of the spacecraft configuration (TDI 1.5) using simulated data.
The MCMC uses fractional delay interpolation (FDI) to digitally delay the raw
phase meter data, and we study the sensitivity of the analysis to the filter
length. Varying levels of complexity in the noise covariance matrix are also
examined. Delay estimations are found to result in LFN suppression well below
the level of secondary noises and constraints on the armlengths to
$\mathcal{O}(30)\ {\rm cm}$ over the ${\sim}2.5\ {\rm Gm}$ baseline.

  Sampling",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although deep learning has demonstrated astonishing performance in many
applications, there are still concerns about its dependability. One desirable
property of deep learning applications with societal impact is fairness (i.e.,
non-discrimination). Unfortunately, discrimination might be intrinsically
embedded into the models due to the discrimination in the training data. As a
countermeasure, fairness testing systemically identifies discriminatory
samples, which can be used to retrain the model and improve the model's
fairness. Existing fairness testing approaches however have two major
limitations. Firstly, they only work well on traditional machine learning
models and have poor performance (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency) on deep
learning models. Secondly, they only work on simple structured (e.g., tabular)
data and are not applicable for domains such as text. In this work, we bridge
the gap by proposing a scalable and effective approach for systematically
searching for discriminatory samples while extending existing fairness testing
approaches to address a more challenging domain, i.e., text classification.
Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach only employs lightweight
procedures like gradient computation and clustering, which is significantly
more scalable and effective. Experimental results show that on average, our
approach explores the search space much more effectively (9.62 and 2.38 times
more than the state-of-the-art methods respectively on tabular and text

discrimination by 57.2% and 60.2% respectively on average.

then each was identified as a single clump. Thirty-three clumps were further
mapped at 1$^\prime$ resolution and 54 dense cores were extracted. Among dense
cores, the average excitation temperature $T_{\mathrm{ex}}$ of $^{12}$CO is

optimal data collection from its experience. That is to say, how to synchronize
adjacent level policies optimally. Our research finds that a HRL model through
the off-policy correction technique of HRL, which trains a higher-level policy
with the goal of reflecting a lower-level policy which is newly trained using
the off-policy method, takes the critical role of synchronizing both level
policies at all times while they are being trained. We propose a novel HRL
model supporting the optimal level synchronization using the off-policy
correction technique with a deep generative model. This uses the advantage of
the inverse operation of a flow-based deep generative model (FDGM) to achieve
the goal corresponding to the current state of the lower-level policy. The
proposed model also considers the freedom of the goal dimension between HRL
policies which makes it the generalized inverse model of the model-free RL in
HRL with the optimal synchronization method. The comparative experiment results
show the performance of our proposed model.

Our results show that ISO/IEC 25010:2011 qualities like functional suitability,

accuracy across a wide array of tasks. Most ML approaches focus on
generalization performance on unseen data that are similar to the training data
(In-Distribution, or IND). However, real world applications and deployments of
ML rarely enjoy the comfort of encountering examples that are always IND. In
such situations, most ML models commonly display erratic behavior on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, such as assigning high confidence to wrong
predictions, or vice-versa. Implications of such unusual model behavior are
further exacerbated in the healthcare setting, where patient health can
potentially be put at risk. It is crucial to study the behavior and robustness
properties of models under distributional shift, understand common failure
modes, and take mitigation steps before the model is deployed. Having a
benchmark that shines light upon these aspects of a model is a first and
necessary step in addressing the issue. Recent work and interest in increasing
model robustness in OOD settings have focused more on image modality, while the
Electronic Health Record (EHR) modality is still largely under-explored. We aim
to bridge this gap by releasing BEDS-Bench, a benchmark for quantifying the
behavior of ML models over EHR data under OOD settings. We use two open access,
de-identified EHR datasets to construct several OOD data settings to run tests
on, and measure relevant metrics that characterize crucial aspects of a model's
OOD behavior. We evaluate several learning algorithms under BEDS-Bench and find
that all of them show poor generalization performance under distributional

robustness of EHR models under distributional shift, and BEDS-Bench provides
one way to measure progress towards that goal.

importance of the patch tokens corresponding to the raw images. We propose the
recurrent attention multi-scale transformer (RAMS-Trans), which uses the
transformer's self-attention to recursively learn discriminative region
attention in a multi-scale manner. Specifically, at the core of our approach
lies the dynamic patch proposal module (DPPM) guided region amplification to
complete the integration of multi-scale image patches. The DPPM starts with the
full-size image patches and iteratively scales up the region attention to
generate new patches from global to local by the intensity of the attention
weights generated at each scale as an indicator. Our approach requires only the
attention weights that come with ViT itself and can be easily trained
end-to-end. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMS-Trans performs better
than concurrent works, in addition to efficient CNN models, achieving
state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets.

in some cases, which hinders SBL from convergence; 2) Poor scalability to
problems with high dimensional feature space or large data size; 3) SBL easily
suffers from memory overflow for large-scale data. This paper addresses these
issues with a newly proposed diagonal Quasi-Newton (DQN) method for SBL called
DQN-SBL where the inversion of big covariance matrix is ignored so that the
complexity and memory storage are reduced to O(M). The DQN-SBL is thoroughly
evaluated on non-linear classifiers and linear feature selection using various

receives competitive generalization with a very sparse model and scales well to

study of several 3D kinematic parameters of 59 CMEs studied by Majumdar et al.
(2020). The source regions of these CMEs are identified and classified as
Active Regions (ARs), Active Prominences (APs), and Prominence Eruptions (PEs).
We study several statistical correlations between different kinematic

they propagate from the inner to the outer corona, indicating the importance of
the region where normally the common practice is to perform averaging. We also
find that the parameters in the outer corona is highly influenced by those in
the inner corona, thus indicating the importance of inner corona in the
understanding of the kinematics. We further find that the source regions of the
CMEs tend to have a distinct imprint on the statistical correlations between
different kinematic parameters, and that an overall correlation tends to wash
away this crucial information. The results of this work lends support towards
possibly different dynamical classes for the CMEs from active regions and
prominences which is manifested in their kinematics.

technologies have increased the complexity of power grids and made them more
vulnerable to natural disasters and cyber-physical-human (CPH) threats. To deal
with these extreme events, proactive plans are required by utilities to
minimize the damages caused by CPH threats. This paper proposes a proactive
rolling-horizon-based scheme for the resilience-oriented operation of hydrogen
(H2) systems in integrated distribution and transmission networks. The proposed
framework is a bi-level model in which the upper-level is focused on
distribution system operation in both normal and emergency operation modes, and
the lower-level problem accounts for the transmission network operation. Two
preeminent aspects of H2 systems are considered in this paper, 1) to show the
flexibility of H2 systems, capacity-based demand response signals are
considered for electrolyzers, stationary fuel cell (FC) units, and H2 storage
tanks are considered in both normal and emergency operation modes; 2) unlike
the batteries which can only charge and discharge energy based on maximum
duration times and power ratings, H2 systems can be considered as the flexible
long-term energy storage by storing H2 for days and supplying power to FC in
the case of \textit{N-m} outages lasting for more than 10 hours. Moreover, H2
production cost based on water electrolysis and storage costs is calculated.
Simulation results demonstrate that utilities can improve the system-level
resilience using H2 systems as long-term backup power resources.

non-Poisson clustering of bursts over time and a power-law energy distribution.
However, the extent of the energy distribution towards the fainter end was not

the material parameters from virtual test data sets. In a further step, random
absolute noise is added to the virtual test data to investigate the sensitivity
of the new approach to noise. As a result, the proposed method shows a relevant

the training objectives of LM-based pre-training and NMT. Since the LM
objective learns to reconstruct a few source tokens and copy most of them, the
pre-training initialization would affect the copying behaviors of NMT models.
We provide a quantitative analysis of copying behaviors by introducing a metric
called copying ratio, which empirically shows that pre-training based NMT
models have a larger copying ratio than the standard one. In response to this
problem, we propose a simple and effective method named copying penalty to
control the copying behaviors in decoding. Extensive experiments on both
in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks show that the copying penalty method
consistently improves translation performance by controlling copying behaviors
for pre-training based NMT models. Source code is freely available at

determined by the model and can be located at any candidate node in the network
rather than a static facility defined in advance. The transfer operation is
strictly synchronized between vehicles within a hard time window. A heuristic

much shorter computation time than commercial software. Two sets of synthetic
numerical experiments are tested: small-scale instances based on a 5x5 grid
network, and large-scale instances of varying network sizes up to 250x250 grids

over the years: while mathematicians were originally focussed on abstract
properties (for instance appropriate notions of functional spaces for the

become infeasible, which differs from active set or feasible direction methods,
where the descent motion stops as soon as a new constraint is encountered. The
resulting algorithmic procedure is simple to implement even when constraints
are nonlinear, and is suitable for large-scale constrained optimization
problems in which the feasible set fails to have a simple structure. The key
underlying idea is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities
instead of positions, which has the algorithmic consequence that optimizations
over feasible sets at each iteration are replaced with optimizations over
local, sparse convex approximations. In particular, this means that at each
iteration only constraints that are violated are taken into account. The result
is a simplified suite of algorithms and an expanded range of possible

practical energy conversion and plasmonic catalysis. However, the relationship
between plasmon damping and the coupling between the plasmon and 2D materials

impedes the conventional single-particle method to evaluate the plasmon damping
rate by the spectral linewidth directly. Here, we investigated the interaction
between a single gold nanorod (GNR) and 2D materials using the single-particle
spectroscopy method assisted with in situ nanomanipulation technique by
comparing scattering intensity and linewidth together. Our approach allows us
to indisputably identify that the plasmon-exciton coupling in the GNR-WSe2

between the charge transfer channel and resonant energy transfer channel for
the plasmon decay in the GNR-graphene hybrid by comparing that with thin hBN

state-of-art technologies like autonomous driving. Effective and efficient
prioritization of emergency vehicles (EVs) using cooperative vehicular

prioritization, called preemption, is highly dependent on existing traffic
infrastructure. Accessing crucial decision parameters for preemption like
speed, position and acceleration data in real-time is almost impossible in
current systems. The connected vehicle can provide such data in real-time,
which makes EV preemption more responsive and effective. Also, autonomous
vehicles can help in optimizing the timing in traffic phases and minimize
human-related loss like higher headway times and inconsistent inter-vehicle
spacing when following each other. In this paper, we introduce
self-coordinating a decentralized traffic control system termed as Virtual
Traffic Light plus for Emergency Vehicle (VTL+EV) to prioritize EVs in an
intersection. The proposed system can expedite EVs movement through
intersections and impose minimal waiting time for ordinary vehicles. The VTL+EV
algorithm also can improve overall throughput making an intersection more

modulation symbols via a time-independent channel characterized by the

leveraging appropriate equalization techniques. In this paper, we consider a
neural network-based supervised learning framework for OTFS equalization.
Learning of the introduced neural network is conducted in each OTFS frame
fulfilling an online learning framework: the training and testing datasets are
within the same OTFS-frame over the air. Utilizing reservoir computing, a
special recurrent neural network, the resulting one-shot online learning is
sufficiently flexible to cope with channel variations among different OTFS
frames (e.g., due to the link/rank adaptation and user scheduling in cellular
networks). The proposed method does not require explicit channel state

$\xi\propto|\gamma-\gamma_{c}|^{\nu}$ when $\gamma<\gamma_{c}$, and vanishes

objective. ParaBLEU correlates more strongly with human judgements than
existing metrics, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on the 2017 WMT
Metrics Shared Task. We show that our model is robust to data scarcity,
exceeding previous state-of-the-art performance using only $50\%$ of the
available training data and surpassing BLEU, ROUGE and METEOR with only $40$
labelled examples. Finally, we demonstrate that ParaBLEU can be used to
conditionally generate novel paraphrases from a single demonstration, which we
use to confirm our hypothesis that it learns abstract, generalized paraphrase
representations.

automated reasoning putting together the advances of distinct research areas
such as answer set programming, constraint processing, and satisfiability
modulo theories. Constraint answer set programming demonstrates promising
results, including the development of a multitude of solvers: acsolver,
clingcon, ezcsp, idp, inca, dingo, mingo, aspmt, clingo[l,dl], and ezsmt. It
opens new horizons for declarative programming applications such as solving
complex train scheduling problems. Systems designed to find solutions to
constraint answer set programs can be grouped according to their construction
into, what we call, integrational or translational approaches. The focus of
this paper is an overview of the key ingredients of the design of constraint
answer set solvers drawing distinctions and parallels between integrational and
translational approaches. The paper also provides a glimpse at the kind of
programs its users develop by utilizing a CASP encoding of Travelling Salesman
problem for illustration. In addition, we place the CASP technology on the map
among its automated reasoning peers as well as discuss future possibilities for
the development of CASP.

  Journal of Logic and Computation",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Logic has proved essential for formally modeling software based systems. Such
formal descriptions, frequently called specifications, have served not only as
requirements documentation and formalisation, but also for providing the
mathematical foundations for their analysis and the development of automated
reasoning tools.
  Logic is usually studied in terms of its two inherent aspects: syntax and
semantics. The relevance of the latter resides in the fact that producing
logical descriptions of real-world phenomena, requires people to agree on how
such descriptions are to be interpreted and understood by human beings, so that
systems can be built with confidence in accordance with their specification. On
the more practical side, the metalogical relation between syntax and semantics,
determines important aspects of the conclusions one can draw from the
application of certain analysis techniques, like model checking.
  Abstract model theory (i.e., the mathematical perspective on semantics of
logical languages) is of little practical value to software engineering
endeavours. From our point of view, values (those that can be assigned to
constants and variables) should not be just points in a platonic domain of
interpretation, but elements that can be named by means of terms over the
signature of the specification. In a nutshell, we are not interested in
properties that require any semantic information not representable using the
available syntax.
  In this paper we present a framework supporting the proof theoretical
formalisation of classes of relational models for behavioural logical
languages, whose domains of discourse are guaranteed to be formed exclusively
by nameable values.

assumed to be accelerated to relativistic energies in sub-parsec scale jets,
which radiate by synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission covering
radio to gamma-ray energies. This model can fit most of the multi-wavelength
data points of the four sources. However, the gamma-ray data points from NGC

higher energy {\gamma}-rays detected from these sources. Kilo-parsec scale jets
have been observed previously from these sources in radio and X-ray

jets of these sources from inverse Compton scattering of starlight photons by
ultra-relativistic electrons, then it is possible to fit the gamma-ray data at
higher energies. Our result also suggests that strong host galaxy emission is
required to produce GeV radiation from kilo-parsec scale jets.

might be promising for generating, transporting and injecting hot carriers,
based on first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We found
that the hot-carrier generation rate in TiN is significantly large compared to
Au. The transport property of hot carriers in TiN is excellent, due to the long
lifetime and mean free path. The TiN/TiO2 junction possesses very low Schottky
barrier, which results in much larger injection efficiency than that in the
Au/TiO2 junction. Furthermore, it is revealed that the optimal injection
efficiency could be achieved in a core/shell cylindrical TiN/TiO2 junction. Our
findings provide an in-depth understanding of hot-carrier generation, transport

Understanding how individual-level processes of sampling and reporting test
results can affect community- or population-level spread is a dynamical
modeling question. The effect of testing processes on epidemic dynamics depends
on factors underlying implementation, particularly testing intensity and on
whom testing is focused. Here, we use a simple model to explore how the
individual-level effects of testing might directly impact population-level
spread. Our model development was motivated by the COVID-19 epidemic, but has
generic epidemiological and testing structures. To the classic SIR framework we
have added a per capita testing intensity, and compartment-specific testing
weights, which can be adjusted to reflect different testing emphases --
surveillance, diagnosis, or control. We derive an analytic expression for the
relative reduction in the basic reproductive number due to testing,
test-reporting and related isolation behaviours. Intensive testing and fast
test reporting are expected to be beneficial at the community level because
they can provide a rapid assessment of the situation, identify hot spots, and
may enable rapid contact-tracing. Direct effects of fast testing at the
individual level are less clear, and may depend on how individuals' behaviour
is affected by testing information. Our simple model shows that under some
circumstances both increased testing intensity and faster test reporting can
reduce the effectiveness of control, and allows us to explore the conditions
under which this occurs. Conversely, we find that focusing testing on infected
individuals always acts to increase effectiveness of control.

surroundings, involves blocking the transport of thermal energy regular or
enhanced, taking place through radiative, conductive and convective processes.
For instance, the enhancement of radiative heat transport that takes place by
infra red or far infra red light at low temperature is due to diffractive
propagation. The wavelength of light in this part of the spectrum usually lie
in the range of mm to cms. Hence it can get bent across an obstacle while
propagating forward. Apart from radiative, the convective and conductive
processes also get affected due to appearance of non linearities in the modes
of lattice vibrations and anomalies in material transport due to the appearance
of vorticity and turbulence in the intervening media. The Multilayer insulation
technique has offered a robust thermal protective mechanism to provide proper
insulation to the cold walls of the cryostats from the heat of the

hours of observations of FRB20200120E at 6 GHz using the Robert C. Byrd Green
Bank Telescope. Our fluence limits are several times lower than the average
burst fluences reported at 600 and 1400 MHz. We conclude that these
non-detections are either due to high-frequency bursts being weaker and/or
scintillation-induced modulated. It is also likely that our observations were
non-concurrent with any activity window of FRB20200120E.

optimization-driven design of complex electromagnetic (EM) devices and systems.
More specifically, the computational complexity of the design problem at hand
is addressed by means of a suitable selection and integration of functional
blocks comprising problem-dependent and computationally-efficient modeling and
analysis tools as well as reliable prediction and optimization strategies.
Thanks to the suitable re-formulation of the problem at hand as an optimization
one, the profitable minimum-size coding of the degrees-of-freedom (DoFs), the
""smart"" replacement of expensive full-wave (FW) simulators with proper
surrogate models (SMs), which yield fast yet accurate predictions starting from
minimum size/reduced CPU-costs training sets, a favorable ""environment"" for an
optimal exploitation of the features of global optimization tools in sampling
wide/complex/nonlinear solution spaces is built. This research summary is then
aimed at (i) providing a comprehensive description of the SbD framework and of
its pillar concepts and strategies, (ii) giving useful guidelines for its
successful customization and application to different EM design problems
characterized by different levels of computational complexity, (iii) envisaging
future trends and advances in this fascinating and high-interest (because of
its relevant and topical industrial and commercial implications) topic.
Representative benchmarks concerned with the synthesis of complex EM systems

turning on the antennas at specific phases and measuring the transmitted power.
In our algorithm, the antennas are turned on individually and then pairwise for
the measurements, and rotation of the phased array is not required. We give
numerical results to measure the accuracy of the algorithm as a function of the
signal-to-noise ratio in the measurement setup. We also compare the performance
of our algorithm with the traditional rotating electric vector (REV) method and
observe the superiority of our algorithm. Simulations also demonstrate an
improvement in the coverage on comparing the cumulative distribution function

for its bounded nature. However, many features of the SW noise are still
unexplored. In this paper, firstly, the properties of the SW noise and its
integral process are explored as the parameter $D$ in the SW noise tends to
infinite. It is found that although the distribution of the SW noise is quite
different from Gaussian white noise, the integral process of the SW noise shows
many similarities with the Wiener process. Inspired by the Wiener process,
which uses the diffusion coefficient to denote the intensity of the Gaussian
noise, a quantity is put forward to characterize the SW noise's intensity. Then
we apply the SW noise to a one-dimensional double-well potential system and the
Maier-Stein system to investigate the escape behaviors. A more interesting
result is observed that the mean first exit time also follows the well-known
Arrhenius law as in the case of the Gaussian noise, and the quasi-potential and
the exit location distributions are very close to the results of the Gaussian
noise.

discussed. Then, a new Preisach-type model is introduced as a macroeconomic
aggregation of more realistic microeconomic hysteresis than in the case of the

more general mechanism of branching and may account for the continuous
evolution of the economy and its effect on hysteresis. Furthermore, it is shown
that the sluggishness of economic recovery is an intrinsic manifestation of
hysteresis branching.

solving forward and inverse problems, several technical challenges are present
as roadblocks for more complex and realistic applications. First, most existing
PINNs are based on point-wise formulation with fully-connected networks to
learn continuous functions, which suffer from poor scalability and hard
boundary enforcement. Second, the infinite search space over-complicates the
non-convex optimization for network training. Third, although the convolutional
neural network (CNN)-based discrete learning can significantly improve training
efficiency, CNNs struggle to handle irregular geometries with unstructured
meshes. To properly address these challenges, we present a novel discrete PINN
framework based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and variational structure
of PDE to solve forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) in a
unified manner. The use of a piecewise polynomial basis can reduce the
dimension of search space and facilitate training and convergence. Without the
need of tuning penalty parameters in classic PINNs, the proposed method can
strictly impose boundary conditions and assimilate sparse data in both forward
and inverse settings. The flexibility of GCNs is leveraged for irregular
geometries with unstructured meshes. The effectiveness and merit of the
proposed method are demonstrated over a variety of forward and inverse
computational mechanics problems governed by both linear and nonlinear PDEs.

  Compression","10 Pages, 8 Figures, 5 Tables",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a potential alternative
to traditional deep learning frameworks, due to their promise to provide
increased compute efficiency on event-driven neuromorphic hardware. However, to
perform well on complex vision applications, most SNN training frameworks yield
large inference latency which translates to increased spike activity and
reduced energy efficiency. Hence,minimizing average spike activity while
preserving accuracy indeep SNNs remains a significant challenge and
opportunity.This paper presents a non-iterative SNN training technique
thatachieves ultra-high compression with reduced spiking activitywhile
maintaining high inference accuracy. In particular, our framework first uses
the attention-maps of an un compressed meta-model to yield compressed ANNs.
This step can be tuned to support both irregular and structured channel pruning
to leverage computational benefits over a broad range of platforms. The
framework then performs sparse-learning-based supervised SNN training using
direct inputs. During the training, it jointly optimizes the SNN weight,
threshold, and leak parameters to drastically minimize the number of time steps
required while retaining compression. To evaluate the merits of our approach,
we performed experiments with variants of VGG and ResNet, on both CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, and VGG16 on Tiny-ImageNet.The SNN models generated through the
proposed technique yield SOTA compression ratios of up to 33.4x with no
significant drops in accuracy compared to baseline unpruned counterparts.
Compared to existing SNN pruning methods, we achieve up to 8.3x higher
compression with improved accuracy.

a condition in which an author loses the ability to produce new work or
experiences a creative slowdown. The problem is more difficult in the context
of poetry than prose, as in the latter case authors need not be very concise
while expressing their ideas, also the various aspects such as rhyme, poetic
meters are not relevant for prose. One of the most effective ways to overcome
this writing block for poets can be, to have a prompt system, which would help
their imagination and open their minds for new ideas. A prompt system can
possibly generate one liner, two liner or full ghazals. The purpose of this
work is to give an ode to the Urdu, Hindi poets, and helping them start their
next line of poetry, a couplet or a complete ghazal considering various factors
like rhymes, refrain, and meters. The result will help aspiring poets to get
new ideas and help them overcome writer's block by auto-generating pieces of
poetry using Deep Learning techniques. A concern with creative works like this,
especially in the literary context, is to ensure that the output is not
plagiarized. This work also addresses the concern and makes sure that the
resulting odes are not exact match with input data using parameters like
temperature and manual plagiarism check against input corpus. To the best of
our knowledge, although the automatic text generation problem has been studied
quite extensively in the literature, the specific problem of Urdu, Hindi poetry
generation has not been explored much. Apart from developing system to
auto-generate Urdu, Hindi poetry, another key contribution of our work is to
create a cleaned and preprocessed corpus of Urdu, Hindi poetry (derived from
authentic resources) and making it freely available for researchers in the
area.

density and current density are represented by non-commuting operators. It
follows that the anomaly $I=\partial_t \rho + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j}$, being
essentially a linear combination of these two operators in the
frequency-momentum domain, does not admit eigenstates and has a minimum
uncertainty fixed by the Heisenberg relation $\Delta N \Delta \phi \simeq 1$

an estimate of the minimum uncertainty in the case of a tunnel Josephson
junction made of Nb. Due to this violation of the local conservation of charge,
for the evaluation of the e.m. field generated by the system it is necessary to
use the extended Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics. After recalling its field
